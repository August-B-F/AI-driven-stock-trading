In recent years, AMD has emerged as the preferred choice for gamers, often topping sales charts, including Amazon\u2019s CPU best-sellers list.\n\nJust yesterday, AMD dominated the top 15 spots instead of Intel. Surprisingly, the top processor was AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7 9800X3D, a high-end gaming chip, priced at $480, despite its occasional stock shortages.\n\nThe top 15 list featured a mix of older and newer AMD processors, such as the Ryzen 5 5500 and Ryzen 5 5600X, indicating that AMD has successfully kept older hardware relevant and in demand.\n\nHowever, today\u2019s best-seller list paints a slightly different picture, as Intel has managed to secure several spots, with older models like the Alder Lake chips offering more affordable alternatives to current AMD processors.\n\nInterestingly, Intel\u2019s latest Arrow Lake processors did not make it to the top 50 best-sellers on Amazon. This suggests that many customers prefer the more affordable Intel options or turn to AMD, which has shifted the market dynamics significantly in recent years.\n\nFor more information on these topics, visit diplomacy.edu.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against other AI stocks.\n\nAs businesses invest heavily in artificial intelligence, many leaders remain skeptical about its impact on enterprise productivity. Despite advancements in generative AI, a significant gap exists between its potential and real-world implementation. May Habib, CEO of Writer, shared insights on why AI adoption has been slower than expected and how companies can bridge this divide to unlock its true value.\n\nHabib discussed enterprise adoption of generative AI with Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde, highlighting that many business leaders feel AI has not delivered expected productivity gains. A survey of Fortune 500 executives found that 71% were disappointed with their AI initiatives. Habib attributed this to outdated development approaches, where IT teams create solutions that fail to meet business needs. However, her firm, Writer emphasizes collaboration between IT and business units to build AI tools that integrate with enterprise workflows effectively.\n\nShe explained that AI models need more than just raw computing power; they must be combined with structured and unstructured data to function efficiently in enterprise settings. Unlike many AI firms focused on reasoning models, Writer prioritizes self-evolving models that update in real-time based on user feedback rather than requiring extensive retraining. She argued that this approach is essential for achieving advanced AI capabilities.\n\nHabib also discussed workforce challenges and acknowledged that talent shortages persist, prompting Writer to expand internationally with new offices in London and Singapore. She also noted that the AI startup market is crowded, with many struggling to secure enterprise clients. Writer is exploring acquisitions to improve its platform by integrating innovative solutions from smaller firms.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 database of over 1000 hedge funds.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",

            "content": "By Jonathan Landay and Patricia Zengerle\n\n(Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson named Representative Rick Crawford on Thursday to chair the House intelligence committee, the latest promotion of an ally of President-elect Donald Trump to a key national security post.\n\nThe panel chairman is among eight congressional leaders, known as the Gang of Eight, briefed on the most classified U.S. intelligence matters.\n\n\"I will aggressively uphold our mandate to provide credible and robust oversight of the Intelligence Community's funding and activities,\" Crawford said in a statement.\n\nJohnson tapped Crawford a day after removing Representative Mike Turner from the chairmanship he had held for nearly two years. The position is one of the few chosen by the House speaker at the start of a new Congress.\n\nTrump will be sworn in for a second four-year term on Monday.\n\nTurner, a strong backer of aid for Ukraine, announced late on Wednesday he was removed from the committee, telling CBS News that Johnson had cited \"concerns from Mar-a-Lago\" for the decision. Mar-a-Lago is Trump's estate in Florida.\n\nTurner's office and Crawford's office did not respond to requests for comment. Johnson denied to reporters that he was ordered to relieve Turner, saying it was a House decision.\n\nA source familiar with the matter questioned whether an order for Turner's ouster came from Mar-a-Lago, saying it appeared the decision was made by Johnson, who \"wanted his own person\" as committee chair.\n\nThe source also noted that Turner voted to certify outgoing President Joe Biden's victory over Trump in the 2020 election, while Crawford joined 139 Republican House members and eight senators in voting to overturn the result, a symbolic move backing Trump's unfounded claim of massive fraud.\n\n\"This is a pattern for Johnson,\" said the source, pointing to the appointment of Brian Mast, who also opposed Biden's victory, as the new House Foreign Relations Committee chairman to replace Mike McCaul, who voted to confirm it.\n\nJohnson declined to approve the waiver of term limit rules that would have let McCaul remain chairman.\n\nThose votes came late on Jan. 6, after mobs of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol building.\n\nDemocrats decried Turner's ouster, saying it made the country less safe and weakened the function mandated in the U.S. Constitution that Congress should serve as a check and balance to the executive branch.\n\nBIGGER ROLE FOR AMERICA FIRST PROPONENTS\n\nThe departures of both Turner and McCaul were effectively demotions of senior House Republicans whose foreign policy views have not always aligned with Trump's \"America First\" priorities.\n\nBoth lawmakers are conservative Republicans who rarely break with party leaders, but are known for their willingness to seek bipartisan support on major policy issues.\n\nThey have taken foreign policy and national security positions that differ from some of Trump's more isolationist stances.\n\nTurner and McCaul have backed U.S. military assistance for Ukraine's fight against Russia. Trump has criticized Biden's aid for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and pledged during the 2024 campaign to quickly end the war.\n\nThe source said that in the Republican caucus meeting, Johnson cited as concerns with Turner his support last year for reauthorizing a warrantless foreign surveillance program that some Democrats and Republicans, including Trump, charged had been used to spy on Americans, and his support for Ukraine and NATO.\n\nCrawford, who received a \"D-\" rating on Ukraine in a Republican ratings system, voted against a Ukraine aid bill in April 2024, saying he could not support a financial assistance component when Americans faced rising costs at home.\n\nMast comes from Trump's home state of Florida and has opposed Ukraine aid, earning an \"F\" grade in the rating system.\n\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Johnathan Landay; Additional reporting by Ismail Shakil in Ottawa; editing by Rami Ayyub, Don Durfee and Richard Chang)",

            "content": "Protesters in Jerusalem demonstrate against Netanyahu's decision to oust the Shin Bet chief\n\nThe court's decision came after opposition parties and a non-governmental organisation filed separate appeals hours after the government announced its decision to sack Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid's centre-right Yesh Atid party said it had appealed against Bar's dismissal before the Supreme Court of Israel in the name of several opposition movements.\n\nYesh Atid denounced what it called \"a decision based on flagrant conflict of interest\".\n\nThe Movement for Quality Government in Israel also appealed against what it said was \"an unlawful decision... posing a real risk to the national security of the State of Israel\".\n\nThe NGO was previously very active in the fight against a controversial move by Netanyahu to curb the judiciary's independence.\n\nThat proposed reform was seen by opponents as a danger to Israeli democracy and the rule of law, and sparked one of the largest protest movements in the country's history.\n\nFriday's separate legal appeals came hours after the government moved to dismiss Bar, with Netanyahu previously citing an \"ongoing lack of trust\" in him.\n\nThe Shin Bet chief's sacking was to have been effective before April 10. On Friday, he took part in a Gaza situational assessment meeting along with army chief Eyal Zamir, the military said in a statement.\n\nIt is the first time in Israel's history that the head of the domestic intelligence agency has been fired.\n\nNetanyahu's office said later on Friday the government would meet on Sunday for a no confidence vote on the attorney general, a vocal critic of the prime minister.\n\n\"We resolve to express our lack of confidence in the government's legal adviser, Gali Baharav-Miara, due to her inappropriate behaviour and due to significant and prolonged differences between the government and the government's legal adviser,\" said a cabinet meeting agenda published on the PM office's website.\n\nThousands of Israelis braved cold and rainy weather on Thursday night in protest at the moves against Bar and Baharav-Miara, demonstrating outside parliament and Netanyahu's home in Jerusalem.\n\nOpposition appeal\n\nThe opposition appeal was filed in the name of Yesh Atid, the National Union party headed by former defence minister Benny Gantz, the leftist Democrats alliance and nationalist party Yisrael Beiteinu.\n\nTheir appeal highlights what critics see as the two main reasons why Netanyahu moved against Bar, a Shin Bet veteran who joined the agency in 1993.\n\nThe first was Bar's criticism of the government over the security failure that allowed Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel to become the deadliest day in the country's history.\n\nThe second was what media dubbed \"Qatargate\" -- an investigation into government members allegedly paid by Qatar to promote its image.\n\nThe decision to sack Bar came \"as Israel's Security Agency is currently investigating the prime minister's close associates... on suspicion of receiving money from entities directly linked to and acting on behalf of the State of Qatar\", the opposition appeal read.\n\nIn a letter made public late on Thursday, Bar described his dismissal as motivated by Netanyahu's \"personal interests\".\n\nFriday's appeal also mentioned that Bar's dismissal took place after a Shin Bet investigation highlighting, according to the plaintiffs, \"that the political leadership bears responsibility for the October 7 disaster\".\n\nFault lines\n\nNetanyahu decision revived deep divisions within Israel, with many people concerned by what they see as his latest autocratic move.\n\nIn a video published Thursday, President Isaac Herzog deplored the government's \"controversial moves\" that \"deepened divisions\" while Israel is still at war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nA poll by the Channel 12 television network found that 51 percent of Israelis opposed Bar's sacking, while 32 percent supported it.\n\nA plurality of 46 percent says they trust Bar more than Netanyahu.\n\nThe crisis comes against the backdrop of new Israeli attacks on Gaza since Tuesday and the reintegration into the government of one of Israel's far-right figures, Itamar Ben Gvir.\n\nHe had resigned as national security minister in protest against the ceasefire with Hamas that took effect on January 19.\n\n\"It's impossible not to be deeply troubled by the harsh reality unfolding before our eyes,\" Herzog said on Thursday night.\n\nHe said it was \"unthinkable to resume fighting while still pursuing the sacred mission of bringing our hostages home\" from Gaza.\n\n\u00a9 2025 AFP",

The stock fell 7% on Wednesday as reports emerged that threw cold water on some of the latest deal speculation.\n\nDespite the recent rally, Intel shares are down 43% over the past 12 months amid the company\u2019s inability to make inroads into the booming AI chip market and months of restructuring and deal rumors. The stock fell 0.7% to around $24 on Thursday.\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at Intel\u2019s weekly chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching.\n\nPotential Rectangle Bottom\n\nSince Intel\u2019s steep drop in early August last year, the price has oscillated within an orderly trading range, potentially carving out a rectangle bottom similar to a rangebound period that preceded a trending move in the stock between February and December 2023.\n\nMore recently, the shares have tested the respected 50-week moving average over the past five weeks but have met selling pressure on each occasion.\n\nIn a win for the bulls, the relative strength index (RSI) has reclaimed the 50 threshold, indicating improving price momentum. Trading volume has also increased in recent weeks, suggesting growing investor interest in the stock.\n\nLet\u2019s identify three key overhead areas on Intel\u2019s chart that investors may be watching and also point out an important support level that would likely attract interest during potential retracements.\n\nKey Overhead Areas to Watch\n\nThe first overhead area to watch sits around $26. This level finds a confluence of resistance from the 50-week moving average and a horizontal line that connects the lower and upper ranges of the two rectangle patterns on Intel\u2019s chart.\n\nA decisive breakout above this level could trigger a move to the key $30 area. Investors may look to lock in profits in this region near the psychological round number and a series of peaks and troughs that formed on the chart between November 2022 and June last year.\n\nFollow-through buying may see the shares climb to around $36, a location where they could run into selling pressure near the downward sloping 200-week moving average, which closely aligns with a range of price action on the chart stretching back to June 2022.\n\nThis area also roughly corresponds with a projected bars pattern price target that extracts the stock\u2019s trending move from February to December 2023 and repositions it from last month\u2019s low, predicting what a move higher might look like if price history rhymes.\n\nImportant Support Level to Monitor\n\nFinally, during retracements in Intel shares, investors should keep a close eye on the $19 level. Investors may view this area as a trading floor near the low of the rectangle pattern.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

            "content": "Intel (INTC) has had a rough few years, but its board isn\u2019t backing down from its turnaround efforts. With former CEO Pat Gelsinger stepping aside, the company has placed its bets on semiconductor industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan. Tan has taken up his new role just this week, marking a significant moment in Intel\u2019s history. Tan isn\u2019t just another executive; he\u2019s a seasoned leader with the experience and track record to potentially pull off a revival. Challenges remain, but there\u2019s reason for cautious optimism about Intel\u2019s future under his leadership.\n\nLight Up your Portfolio with Spark:\n\nEasily identify stocks' risks and opportunities.\n\nDiscover stocks' market position with detailed competitor analyses.\n\nIntel (INTC) price history over the past 3 years\n\nI\u2019m staying bullish on the legacy chip maker despite its sluggish revenues, the flurry of Chinese imports, and its lack of AI data center support.\n\nMeet Lip-Bu Tan: The Turnaround Maestro\n\nLip-Bu Tan is not your typical CEO. He\u2019s a semiconductor industry heavyweight with a resume that speaks for itself. As the former CEO of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), he oversaw a staggering 3,200% stock rally over 12 years. His deep background in physics, engineering, and technology investing makes him one of the most respected figures in the industry. Plus, he\u2019s no stranger to Intel\u2014he sat on the company\u2019s board from 2022 to 2024, giving him a front-row seat to its strengths and weaknesses before stepping into the CEO role.\n\nIntel's new CEO Lip-Bu Tan\n\nUnder Tan\u2019s leadership, he will receive $25 million in performance-based stock options, aligning his financial incentives with Intel\u2019s turnaround efforts. This won\u2019t be his first significant stake in the company, either. He bought $3 million of Intel shares in November 2022 and another $2.5 million in November 2023. This kind of financial commitment sends a strong message: Tan believes in Intel\u2019s future and puts his money where his mouth is.\n\nHowever, confidence and sentiment alone aren\u2019t enough. Gelsinger also believed in Intel\u2019s long-term potential, yet he ultimately didn\u2019t deliver the results shareholders expected. The big question now is whether Tan can succeed where Gelsinger fell short. Investors have seen Intel struggle with leadership changes before, but Tan\u2019s mix of technical know-how and financial acumen may finally give the company the stability and direction it desperately needs.\n\nShort-Term Pain Leads to Long-Term Potential\n\nIntel\u2019s financials have been, in a word, rough. Annual revenue almost halved during the COVID years. Even worse, its net income nosedived from $20 billion to an $18.8 billion loss in 2024. Meanwhile, competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) have surged ahead, capitalizing on the AI boom while Intel struggles to keep up.",

            "content": "Intel Vice President Ann Kelleher, an engineer charged with restoring the technological lead the company once held, plans to retire by year\u2019s end, setting off a major transition in the company\u2019s manufacturing arm.\n\nA 29-year Intel veteran, Kelleher is one of Intel\u2019s top Oregon executives. Intel said Thursday she will retire \u201csometime later this year\u201d and gave her a new title as \u201cstrategic adviser\u201d to Intel Foundry, the company\u2019s manufacturing arm. Kelleher, 59, had been general manager of Intel\u2019s technology development.\n\nThe announcement of her planned exit comes two days after new CEO Lip-Bu Tan formally started work. Naga Chandrasekaran, a former Micron executive Intel hired last year to run its factory operations, will take over Kelleher\u2019s role in technology development and serve as Intel\u2019s chief technology and operations officer for Intel Foundry.\n\nIntel announced last fall that it had chosen a \u201clong-term\u201d successor to Kelleher \u2014 Navid Shahriari \u2014 but hadn\u2019t indicated when she would be retiring. On Thursday, Intel named Shahriari executive vice president of a new organization that will coordinate various manufacturing activities across its factories.\n\nThis is a key moment for Intel, which is preparing to introduce a new manufacturing process this year in hopes of closing its technological gap with rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Kelleher oversaw development of the new technology, which Intel calls 18A, in the company\u2019s Hillsboro research factories.\n\nOriginally from Ireland, Kelleher joined Intel in 1996 and worked her way up through the company from process engineer to factory manager. She has led the company\u2019s technology development since 2020.\n\n\u201cWith a strong foundry leadership team in place and Intel 18A progressing well ahead of our first product launch and external customer tape-outs, this is a well-planned transition as we continue to advance our Foundry priorities in service to customers,\u201d the company said in a written statement.\n\nIntel\u2019s headquarters are in Silicon Valley but the company\u2019s largest operations are in Washington County, where the company has 20,000 employees. Those employees have long included some of Intel\u2019s top executives, including Michelle Johnston Holthaus, who is CEO of Intel Products, the company\u2019s chip design business.\n\nIntel\u2019s manufacturing research has long been centered in Hillsboro. Chandrasekaran is based in Arizona but Intel said he spends time at all the company\u2019s factories.\n\nThis article has been updated with additional information about where Naga Chandrasekaran works.\n\n-- Mike Rogoway covers Oregon technology and the state economy.

While the compiler-side support for Advanced Performance Extensions has been coming together, necessary Linux kernel infrastructure has yet to be settled. Last month saw initial Linux kernel patches for handling APX while today they were revised. As noted then, APX isn't intended to be used in kernel-mode but rather just user-space applications, but that the kernel needs to make accommodates with the new APX register state and other differences that need to be properly handled.\n\nThat first round of Intel APX patches for the Linux kernel had also included a patch to drop Intel Memory Protection Extensions (MPX) support as it clashed with the initial APX code and MPX itself has been deprecated for a while. But in today's updated patches the MPX removal patch itself was dropped since the APX code has been reworked to jive together nicely.The updated Intel APX code also has various other Intel APX code alterations as it undergoes review and upstream kernel mailing list discussion. Those interested can find today's Intel APX kernel patches via this patch series that is still under a \"request for comments\" marking.With the APX patches not settled yet, this code isn't yet in a position for merging in the upcoming Linux v6.15 merge window. Thus we're now looking at a H2'2025 Linux kernel release at the earliest before the Intel APX kernel support will be ready. Thus it's still looking like it won't be until Intel's next-next-generation of processors before APX is likely to debut.",

These offerings help streamline and speed up AI adoption at the edge across industries such as retail, manufacturing, smart cities, and media and entertainment by simplifying integration with existing infrastructure.\n\n\u201cOur customers want to expand the use of AI in their existing infrastructure and workflows at the edge, ensuring they meet their total cost of ownership and achieve power and performance goals. With decades of experience at the edge, we\u2019re taking our edge AI offerings and support one step further with Intel AI Edge Systems, Edge AI Suites and Open Edge Platform to accelerate the delivery of AI-ready solutions across the ecosystem.\u201d \u2014 Dan Rodriguez, Intel corporate vice president and general manager of the Edge Computing Group\n\nWhy It Matters: Edge AI is becoming an essential driver of enterprise innovation. Gartner forecasts that by the end of 2025, 50% of enterprise-managed data will be processed outside traditional data centers or the cloud \u2014 in places such as retail stores, manufacturing plants and healthcare facilities. By 2026, at least half of edge computing deployments will involve machine learning1.\u200b\n\nWith over 100,000 real-world edge implementations with partners, many leveraging AI today, Intel understands the unique challenges of edge AI. These challenges vary significantly by industry, with each having distinct performance and power needs. What works for cloud providers is not suitable for enterprises at the edge, which need to maintain existing platforms and software, while integrating AI, to get the best total cost of ownership (TCO) and power efficiency.\n\nUnlike large data centers with dedicated AI infrastructure, edge AI deployments must seamlessly integrate into preexisting IT systems in space-constrained, low-power and cost-sensitive environments.\n\nIntel AI Edge Systems, alongside Edge AI Suites and the Open Edge Platform, address these challenges by building on Intel\u2019s pervasive technology foundation at the edge. These efforts empower the ecosystem to bring edge AI to market faster and more efficiently.\n\nThe open edge approach allows Intel to consistently deliver better end-to-end performance and overall TCO in a variety of key industries. In an edge AI video analytics use case, tera operations per second (TOPs) alone don\u2019t deliver real-world performance needs. When comparing Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 Ultra processors to leading AI competition, although competition may lead in TOPs, Intel delivers up to a 2.3x increase in end-to-end pipeline performance, and up to 5x better performance per dollar2.\n\n\u200b\n\nHow an Open Ecosystem Accelerates Edge AI: While many edge deployments today incorporate AI using traditional machine learning and computer vision, Intel\u2019s AI Edge Systems, Edge AI Suites and Open Edge Platform are designed to accelerate the deployment of advanced AI applications. Through a robust ecosystem of trusted partners, Intel enables enterprises to tackle industry-specific challenges and drive innovation in edge AI deployments.\n\nIntel AI Edge Systems: Intel\u2019s edge systems speed up AI deployment at the edge. Builders \u2013 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs) \u2013 have access to standardized blueprints, benchmarks and verification tools optimized for edge AI use cases. These resources enable customers and solution providers to easily configure systems to meet the performance needs of use cases like vision AI or generative AI (GenAI). With a range of power levels, sizes and performance options, these solutions ensure optimal integration of hardware and software.\n\nIntel\u2019s edge systems speed up AI deployment at the edge.

            "content": "Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) just kicked off a major shake-up under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, and he's wasting no time making big moves. Tan is set to slash middle management, overhaul the company's AI strategy, and double down on Intel's foundry businessa division that has struggled to keep up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). With Intel posting a $19 billion loss in 2024, its worst since 1986, Tan is on a mission to revive the company's competitive edge. His strategy? A leaner, faster, and more aggressive Intel, capable of not just designing top-tier chips but also manufacturing them for giants like Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nBut the market just threw Intel a curveball. Shares dropped 5.6% at 12.33pm, after Taiwan's National Development Council shut down speculation that TSMC was eyeing a buyout of Intel's foundry business. Earlier reports had suggested TSMC was in talks with Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom about taking stakes in a joint venture to run Intel's chip factories. That rumor fueled a 22% year-to-date rally in Intel's stock. With TSMC's denial, investors are left wondering if Intel can pull off a solo turnaround or if it's still searching for a lifeline.\n\nNow, the pressure is on Tan to deliver. His success hinges on locking in major clients and ramping up production of Intel's next-gen AI chip, Panther Lake. The company is betting big on this chip to compete with Nvidia's dominance in AI processors, but time is running out. If Intel can't prove its foundry business is viable, it risks falling even further behind. With Wall Street watching closely, Tan's next moves will determine whether Intel stages a historic comebackor cements its decline.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "With more than 20% of U.S. agricultural production destined for foreign markets, exports are critical to the financial success of American farmers and ranchers. In 2024, U.S. farmers exported over 144 million metric tons of agricultural products, valued at more than $105 billion, through ocean ports. These ocean shipments represented nearly 60% of total agricultural export value and 65% by volume, underscoring the vital role of maritime transport in delivering U.S. agriculture to global customers. However, recent proposals to impose substantial fees on Chinese-built and -operated vessels entering U.S. ports could have far-reaching consequences for agricultural trade.\n\nProposed Fees on Chinese-Built and -Operated Vessels\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed a series of fees targeting ocean carriers with ties to China. These fees are part of broader efforts to counter China\u2019s growing dominance in global shipbuilding and logistics, while attempting to stimulate U.S. shipbuilding capacity. The proposal includes:\n\nFees up to $1 million per entrance on Chinese-operated vessels. Fees up to $1.5 million on Chinese-built vessels, scaled based on the percentage of an operator\u2019s fleet built in China. Additional fees on operators with future orders placed with Chinese shipyards. A gradual requirement to shift a growing percentage of U.S. exports onto U.S.-flagged and U.S.-built vessels.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s (USTR) office argues these measures are necessary to counteract China\u2019s unreasonable targeting of the maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors for dominance. The concern is that China's monopolization reduces competition, displaces foreign firms and increases dependencies on Chinese supply chains. The fee proposals are currently open for public comment until March 24, with a public hearing scheduled on the same day. Following the hearing and review of public feedback, USTR will decide on how to implement the proposed measures.\n\nPotential Impacts on U.S. Agriculture\n\nWhile addressing China\u2019s maritime dominance is a valid national security concern, these proposals may unintentionally \u2013 and disproportionally \u2013 penalize U.S. farmers and ranchers who rely on affordable and efficient shipping. Over 21% of all vessels calling at U.S. ports in 2024 were Chinese-built, meaning a substantial share of vessels transporting U.S. goods \u2014 including agricultural products \u2014 could be subject to these fees.\n\nBulk agricultural exports, particularly grains and oilseeds, are especially vulnerable. In 2024, the U.S. exported over 106 million metric tons of bulk agricultural products. Assuming an average vessel capacity of 60,000 metric tons, approximately 1,770 vessel movements per year support these exports. Applying the 21% figure for Chinese-built vessels translates to about 372 vessel trips per year facing the proposed fees.\n\nMany dry bulk vessels arriving at U.S. ports from China often come partially loaded or even empty, since China\u2019s primary exports to the U.S. are manufactured goods typically shipped in container vessels. Once in the U.S., these bulk carriers are essential to agriculture, frequently loaded with grains, oilseeds, and other commodities for export.\n\nContainer ships, by contrast, typically arrive in the U.S. full and return to China empty or lightly loaded. This is why container shipping rates are much higher from Asia to the U.S. than in the reverse direction \u2014 importers bear most of those costs on the inbound leg.\n\nFor bulk carriers, the opposite is true: they may arrive empty but leave full with U.S. agricultural products. That means U.S. exporters, particularly farmers, are more exposed to any added vessel fees, since they rely on filling those ships for outbound sales. In effect, while container shipping fees weigh more heavily on U.S. importers, dry bulk shipping fees fall squarely on U.S. exporters \u2014 leaving farmers to absorb the brunt of higher transportation costs.\n\nDepending on whether the $1 million fee on Chinese-operated vessels, the $1.5 million fee on Chinese-built vessels, or both cumulative fees are applied, bulk agricultural exporters could face an additional $372 million to $930 million in annual transportation costs. On a per-unit basis, these compounded fees translate to an increase of 9.5 to 27.75 cents per bushel of soybeans \u2014 representing a substantial margin loss in global markets where competitiveness is often determined by mere pennies per bushel.\n\nFor example, as of March 6,the rate for shipping grain from the U.S. Gulf to Japan was $46.25 per metric ton. From the Pacific Northwest, the rate stood at $27 per metric ton. On a ship holding 60,000 metric tons, a $1 million fee would increase these rates to $62.91 and $43.66 per metric ton, respectively. A $1.5 million fee would push them further, to $71.25 and $52 per metric ton respectively. Such increases will make U.S. products less competitive on the global market and most of this would be passed back to farmers through lower prices or widened basis levels.",

            "content": "The HR Digest was the first to cover that Intel layoffs will be back in the spotlight with the arrival of new CEO Lip Bu Tan. It seems Tan is wasting no time in making sweeping changes at the semiconductor giant. Chief among these changes are job cuts at Intel in 2025 that could redefine the giant\u2019s workforce. With a strategy rooted in revitalizing manufacturing, accelerating AI innovation and staging a fierce fightback against NVIDIA. Lip Bu Tan\u2019s vision comes with a grim reminder. Intel layoffs are a much-needed sacrifice for survival in 2025.\n\nThe upcoming layoffs in 2025 now build on last year\u2019s workforce reduction of 15,000 jobs. This move shrank the giant\u2019s headcount to around 109,000 along with employee morale. Lip Bu Tan, returning after a brief exit from Intel\u2019s board in August 2024, now has his sights set on trimming the fluff. This so-called fluff is a \u2018bloated middle management layer\u2019. A move that sources say frustrated him during his earlier tenure. At a recent town hall, Lip-Bu Tan hinted at the scale of layoffs at Intel in 2025. He called for \u201ctough decisions\u201d to restore agility within the company. The exact figures for these Intel job cuts remain under wraps for now. Although the writing on the wall couldn\u2019t be clearer. More reductions are coming to Intel.\n\nLayoffs at Intel will tackle a massive financial crisis\n\nWhy the urgency with Intel layoffs in 2025? The semiconductor giant made a loss of $19 billion in 2024. This financial tailspin, its first since 1986, demands immediate and brutal action. Lip Bu Tan\u2019s plan now depends on two vastly different fronts: reclaiming dominance in semiconductor manufacturing and catching up in the AI race against the likes of Meta and Nvidia.\n\nIntel\u2019s foundry ambitions, launched under former CEO Pat Gelsinger, aimed to produce chips for clients like Nvidia but failed amid delays and quality issues. Tan is doubling down, pushing the \u201c18A\u201d process tied to Intel\u2019s next-gen AI chip, Panther Lake. Early tests with Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD show promise, but success here is critical to luring big names and reversing Intel\u2019s slide against TSMC.\n\nNew CEO Lip Bu Tan\u2019s fightback strategy at Intel unfolds\n\nOn the AI front, Tan is tackling Intel\u2019s lag. Rivals like Nvidia churn out AI chips yearly, while Intel\u2019s pace has sizzled. His goal? Streamline operations with more layoffs at Intel, boost yields, and target a competitive AI chip architecture by 2027. It\u2019s a tall order, and the Intel layoffs are the cornerstone of this strategy. A bold move to fund this fightback by slashing costs and bureaucracy. Investors seem to agree with the plan. Intel\u2019s stock surged over 8% on Nasdaq after news of Lip Bu Tan\u2019s layoffs broke.\n\n\u201cLip-Bu will be spending a lot of time listening to customers, partners and employees as he comes on board and works closely with our leadership team to position the business for future success,\u201d an Intel spokesman said in a statement.\n\nThe human cost of Intel job cuts in 2025\n\nThe human toll of these Intel job cuts can\u2019t be ignored. Layoffs at Intel aren\u2019t new, but this round feels different. It\u2019s more surgical and existential. Tan\u2019s disdain for the company\u2019s drifted culture, once epitomized by Andy Grove\u2019s \u201conly the paranoid survive,\u201d drives his focus on efficiency. For a workforce already reeling from last year\u2019s Intel job losses, the message is clear: adapt or exit.\n\nIt cannot be understated that Intel layoffs in 2025 will be a defining gamble. Lip Bu Tan isn\u2019t just pruning the ranks. He\u2019s replanting Intel\u2019s roots in semiconductors and AI. The job cuts at Intel in 2025 may spark short-term pain; however, they\u2019re aimed at long-term gain. Whether this strategy resurrects Intel\u2019s glory days depends on execution. For now, the semiconductor industry holds its breath, and Intel\u2019s employees brace for the fallout.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on the upcoming Intel layoffs?

            "content": "NEW ALBANY, Ohio \u2014 When Intel announced its intent to develop a $28 billion semiconductor plant in rural central Ohio, elected officials from both parties lauded a project touted as the largest single private-sector investment in state history.\n\nThe project was in many ways a poster child for the bipartisan 2022 law known as the CHIPS and Science Act, which supports U.S.-based U.S.-based investments from semiconductor companies in hopes of ensuring that the United States remains competitive in chip research and manufacturing. Intel is set to receive nearly $8 billion in federal funding for the Ohio project and its other efforts.\n\nThen Donald Trump won the presidency again. During his joint address to Congress this month, Trump attacked the chips law, telling lawmakers he wants to see it rolled back.\n\n\u201cYour CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe give hundreds of billions of dollars, and it doesn\u2019t mean a thing. They take our money, and they don\u2019t spend it.\u201d Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., nodded in agreement behind Trump.\n\nIn many ways, the Ohio project is emblematic of the uncertainty over funds pledged but unspent by the Biden administration.\n\nTrump has taken wide-ranging steps to overhaul the federal government, pause the work of various agencies and halt funding for a variety of initiatives, though it\u2019s not clear what that might mean for projects like Intel\u2019s Ohio plant and others under the $53 billion chips law. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick during a confirmation hearing called the law an \u201cexcellent down payment\u201d but added that it needs to be studied \u201cto make sure that you get the benefit of the bargain.\u201d That at least suggests some of the funding could be at risk.\n\nTrump\u2019s demands could now serve as a new hurdle for the facility that has already faced delays.\n\nThe sudden reversal has elected leaders cautious about Trump\u2019s comments, with many emphasizing the law\u2019s bipartisan support. Democratic members of the state Senate have been more forceful, urging Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine to voice support of the chips law. DeWine, a Republican, said in a local television interview that Trump\u2019s remarks \u201chaven\u2019t changed my mind a bit\u201d when it comes to his support of the law.\n\nProgress and delay\n\nIntel\u2019s Ohio facility, located less than 20 miles northeast of Columbus, has the look of a large campus, with concrete pads already in place, makeshift roads and many cranes at work. Just days before Trump\u2019s address, however, the company announced it was delaying the opening to 2030 at the earliest. When the project was announced three years ago, the plant had been slated to open this year.\n\nThe Ohio site is the only one of the four Intel projects receiving chips funding that is a fully new plant, rather than an expansion to an existing facility, which presents different challenges.\n\nThe Biden administration originally announced Intel\u2019s grant at \u201cup to\u201d $8.5 billion, the largest grant through the law, a figure the Commerce Department in November refined to about $7.9 billion. Intel has received $2.2 billion of that money through Jan. 30, according to its latest quarterly report. Intel did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJust weeks before the Commerce Department announced funding plans, 18 regional business organizations, including 11 from Ohio, sent a letter to then-President Joe Biden pressing for funding to be released, saying they were \u201cgrowing concerned that federal funds associated with these laws are not being distributed in a timely manner.\u201d\n\nIntel\u2019s financial struggles have also prompted concerns. The company reported that fourth-quarter revenue was down 7 percent year-over-year, and down for a third straight quarter.\n\nKenny McDonald, president and CEO of economic development agency One Columbus, has been involved in the Intel talks since the beginning. McDonald said concerns about the CHIPS Act and the disbursement of funds aren\u2019t unexpected, given the delays.\n\n\u201cThe way that it was implemented, the way that the money ultimately was delivered, the twists and turns that it took just because of the political realities of our current era, it\u2019s not surprising that there would be criticism of it, and in particular the way that it actually had been or tried to be implemented,\u201d McDonald said.\n\nOther community members say the delays give local municipalities time to catch up with ambitious plans. The city of Johnstown is about three miles from the Intel plant. Mayor Donny Barnard said Johnstown is going to feel the impact of the plant\u2019s arrival and needs to prepare appropriate infrastructure to support the increased traffic and surge of jobs.\n\nThe project\u2019s delays, he said, have given Johnstown \u201cmore time to prepare for our future\u201d as the city tackles issues like zoning and development.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really helping us to get on the right footing and prepare and do the city right, versus just doing it so quickly that we make mistakes,\u201d Barnard said. \u201cAnd that was the fear at first, because we were rushing so fast when the original date was 2025 that we would make mistakes.\u201d\n\nLooking forward\n\nLawmakers whose districts or states would benefit from the funding are unlikely to line up for Trump\u2019s requested rollback \u2014 and one of Ohio\u2019s new senators has even been a staunch proponent of the Intel project.\n\nRepublican Sen. Jon Husted, who was appointed by DeWine to fill JD Vance\u2019s Senate seat and served as DeWine\u2019s lieutenant governor, reaffirmed his support for the CHIPS Act, which he described as \u201ca major piece of bipartisan legislation,\u201d and said he is \u201cconfident bipartisan support remains\u201d for the law.\n\n\u201cFor the economic and national security of America, we need to make chips in the USA \u2014 I believe this is part of an America First agenda,\u201d Husted said. \u201cMaking chips in places like Ohio will make sure that China doesn\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nOhio\u2019s other senator, Republican Bernie Moreno, who was elected in November, said in a statement to CQ Roll Call that some of Trump\u2019s other economic policy efforts are perhaps better methods of encouraging semiconductor production in the United States.\n\n\u201cInstead of forcing taxpayers to foot the bill and burdening businesses with oppressive regulations like Joe Biden did, President Trump is correctly pointing out that tariffs and tax reform will incentivize these companies to bring manufacturing back to the United States,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cI fully support his common-sense approach, which is already proving incredibly successful as we\u2019ve seen with major wins like TSMC\u2019s recent $100 billion investment.\u201d\n\nSoon after the 2024 election, Moreno said he believed the law should be modified, rather than gutted, and that it\u2019s important to \u201chonor commitments that the United States government has made,\u201d according to the NPR and PBS Ohio statehouse bureau.\n\nRepublicans are moving to enact key elements of Trump\u2019s agenda through a wide-ranging budget reconciliation process \u2014 but CHIPS funding hasn\u2019t been in GOP lawmakers\u2019 crosshairs: A preliminary House Budget Committee document circulated in January that details trillions of dollars in potential spending cuts and revenue-raisers didn\u2019t mention the legislation.\n\nBut other actions could slow or stop funds. For one thing, around 40 percent of the staffers at the Commerce Department office overseeing the rollout of the funding are set to be cut as part of efforts to trim the federal government, Bloomberg reported on March 5.\n\nMcDonald, the Columbus-area economic development leader, said he remains bullish about the future of the Intel plant and its federal funding. He said he believes the Trump administration recognizes the \u201cgeopolitical implications\u201d of investments in chip production.\n\n\u201cThose in leadership now were some of the same people that started some of these very ideas when they started working with Intel and TSMC in Arizona during the end of the first Trump administration,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I believe strongly, as we do here, that we need to have this industry in the U.S. for national security reasons, national competitiveness reasons and obviously to bring manufacturing innovation back to the U.S. as well.\u201d\n\nChris Berry, the founder and CEO of Columbus-area software engineering group Echelle Resources, said the central Ohio technology community has been energized by the arrival of Intel and the federal government\u2019s investment. But even in the face of multiple roadblocks for the project, the industry is surging in the region, he said.\n\n\u201cDespite the potential delays and things we\u2019re talking about \u2014 the CHIPS Act funding and Intel investment timeline \u2014 the long-term trajectory for Columbus as a Midwest tech hub remains strong,\u201d Berry said.",

            "content": "At GTC 2025, former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger reiterated his oft-repeated claim that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 'got lucky' with the AI revolution but explained his rationale more in-depth.\n\nAs GPUs have taken center stage in AI innovation, Nvidia is now one of the world's most valuable companies, while Intel is struggling. But it was not always this way. Fifteen to twenty years ago, Intel CPUs were the dominant force in computing as they handled all major workloads. During this time, Intel missed its AI and HPC opportunities with Larrabee, a project that attempted to build a GPU using the x86 CPU ISA. In contrast, Nvidia bet on purebred GPUs, said Pat Gelsinger, former CTO and CEO of Intel, while speaking at Nvidia's GTC 2025.\n\n\"The CPU was the king of the hill [in the mid-2000s], and I applaud Jensen for his tenacity of just saying, 'No, I am not trying to build one of those; I am trying to deliver against the workload starting in graphics,\" said Gelsinger. \"You know, it became this broader view. And then he got lucky with AI, and one time I was debating with him, he said, 'No, I got really lucky with AI workload because it just demanded that type of architecture.' That is where the center of application development is [right now].\n\nOne of the reasons why Larrabee was canceled as a GPU in 2009 was that it was not competitive as a graphics processor against AMD's and Nvidia's graphics solutions at the time. To some extent, this was due to Intel's desire for Larrabee to feature ultimate programmability, which led to its lack of crucial fixed-function GPU parts such as raster operations units. This affected performance and increased the complexity of software development.\n\n\"I had a project that was well known in the industry called Larrabee and which was trying to bridge the programmability of the CPU with a throughput oriented architecture [of a GPU], and I think had Intel stay on that path, you know, the future could have been different,\" said Gelsinger during a webcast. \"I give Jensen a lot of credit [as] he just stayed true to that throughput computing or accelerated [vision].\"\n\nUnlike GPUs from AMD and Nvidia, which use proprietary instruction set architectures (ISAs), Intel's Larrabee used the x86 ISA with Larrabee-specific extensions. This provided an advantage for parallelized general-purpose computing workloads but was a disadvantage for graphics applications. As a result, Larrabee was reintroduced as the Xeon Phi processor, first aimed at supercomputing workloads in 2010. However, it gained little traction as traditional GPU architectures gained general-purpose computing capabilities via the CUDA framework, as well as the OpenCL/Vulkan and DirectCompute APIs, which were easier to scale in terms of performance. After the Xeon Phi 'Knights Mill' failed to meet expectations, Intel dropped the Xeon Phi project in favor of data center GPUs for HPC and specialized ASICs for AI between 2018 and 2019.\n\nTo a large extent, Larrabee and its successors in the Xeon Phi line failed because they were based on a CPU ISA that did not scale well for graphics, AI, or HPC. Larrabee's failure was set in motion in the mid-2000s when CPUs were still dominant, and Intel's technical leads thought that x86 was a way to go. Fast forward to today, and Intel's attempts at adopting a more conventional GPU design for AI have largely failed, with the company recently canceling its Falcon Shores GPUs for data centers. Instead, the company is pinning its hopes on its next-gen Jaguar Shores that isn't slated for release until next year.",

The company is also making a push to grow its chip manufacturing unit as a foundry services provider for third parties. The problem is that Intel's foundry unit has been racking up huge losses and looking shaky when it comes to hitting tech milestones and winning major fab contracts.\n\nIntel's foundry struggles have prompted speculation that TSMC and other players in the chip space could step in and buy out some or all of the unit. But a new report is throwing some water on those hopes. Paul Liu, a member of TSMC's board and also the head of Taiwan's National Development Council, recently said that buying Intel's foundry unit has not been considered.\n\nWhat comes next for Intel?\n\nIntel recently named Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO to replace Pat Gelsinger, and investors are wondering what approach the new leader will take with the foundry business. The company is facing a decision that will have a dramatic impact on the structural makeup of the company, and there are some good reasons to think that selling the foundry or bringing in partners to operate it as a joint venture would be the right thing for Intel. But it's tough to gauge how much real interest there is from TSMC and other tech players.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

In an Acquired podcast at NVIDIA's GTC 2025 venue, Gelsinger was asked about how NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, came to realize how big AI actually is, and in response, not only did he say that Jensen got lucky with AI, but also expressed that NVIDIA's current hardware stack is too expensive for AI inferencing workloads.\n\nThe CPU was the king of the hill, and I applaud Jensen for his tenacity in just saying, \"No, I am not trying to build one of those; I am trying to deliver against the workload starting in graphics.\" And, then, he got lucky, right with AI. Today, if we think about the training workload, okay, but you have to give away something much more optimized for inferencing. You know a GPU is way too expensive; I argue it is 10,000 expensive to fully realize what we want to do with the deployment of inferencing for AI and then, of course, what's beyond that.\n\nIt is safe to say here that NVIDIA was the one who stayed committed to the \"long-ball\" game with AI, and that is what Gelsinger has applauded Jensen for, sticking to his instincts. Intel's former CEO had previously expressed concerns about NVIDIA's AI progress, labeling CUDA as a \"moat\" and that the real future lies in inference, but despite such comments, Team Blue never really did manage to capitalize on the AI hype, earning far less revenue compared to what its competitors were able to.\n\nAs far as where Intel stands right now, the firm has abandoned its much-anticipated \"Falcon Shores\" AI lineup and has bet its future on next-gen \"Jaguar Shores. Moreover, Intel's Gaudi lineup has shown significantly underwhelming performance compared to counterparts like Instinct or Hopper, which makes it clear that Intel hasn't managed to find its footing in the AI market. With Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, there's optimism towards the future of the company, but nothing is concrete as of now.\n\nGelsinger also said that quantum processing is likely to be the next form of computing the industry will focus on in the future, and the technology might see market adoption by the end of this decade.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Since Intel Corp. announced that Lip-Bu Tan would take over as CEO last week, the company\u2019s shares have soared. Now, as Tan assumes his job, it is far from clear how he will fulfill the big hopes that have been placed on his shoulders.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAhead of taking on his new role on Tuesday, Tan sent a letter to employees warning that it won\u2019t be easy for the company to hold off the forces that have sent it into decline.\n\nBut Tan didn\u2019t specify how he plans to tackle the problems, leaving analysts to wonder whether he will try to break up Intel and sell it off for parts, as many on Wall Street want, or whether he\u2019ll attempt a version of his predecessor\u2019s plan to work from the inside to fix its troubled manufacturing and product lines.\n\nFollow the Big Take daily podcast wherever you listen.\n\nIt all adds up to a \u201cshow me\u201d moment for the company, according to Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to see some improvement in their product in order for it to get back to where it once was. And I think it\u2019s a great start, it\u2019s a good direction, but they are still a long ways away from where they were.\u201d\n\nThe announcement of Tan\u2019s appointment last Wednesday sparked a rally that has sent the stock up 24% through Monday\u2019s close, adding $22 billion to the company\u2019s market value and making it the top performer on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index since the beginning of the year. Bank of America upgraded the stock in the wake of the news, writing that it \u201chas a greater opportunity to restructure/turn things around\u201d under Tan. Shares fell about 1% in early trading Tuesday, alongside a broader-market slip.\n\nBut analysts noted that Tan\u2019s letter \u2014 in which he promised to re-establish Intel as a \u201cworld-class foundry\u201d for chips \u2014 did not make it clear if he is considering splitting up the company\u2019s foundry business from its chip-design arm, as has been discussed in the past. He also did not address recent reports that one of its biggest competitors, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., might help operate some of Intel\u2019s US factories at the request of the Trump administration.\n\nThe optimism around Tan is in no small part a reflection of how far Intel has fallen from the days when it was the giant of the semiconductor industry. The stock is down about 60% from the peak it hit in early 2000, erasing more than $330 billion in market value for investors.",

His plan includes further cost-cutting measures, management restructuring and a renewed push into AI chip production. Tan has been openly critical of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's execution, particularly in manufacturing decisions and Intel's failure to secure a competitive position in the AI market.\n\nA key focus of Tan's strategy is revitalizing Intel Foundry, the company's contract chip manufacturing business, which serves clients like Microsoft and Amazon. While Intel previously aimed to challenge Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and Nvidia in AI and semiconductor production, execution missteps and a weakening market led to significant setbacks, including an annual loss of $19 billion in 2024.\n\nTan is expected to push for an annual AI chip release cycle, positioning Intel's next-generation Panther Lake chips\u2014built on the company's new 18A process\u2014as a critical test for its ability to compete. However, industry experts note that it could take years for Intel to develop AI hardware capable of rivaling Nvidia's dominance.\n\nAt an internal town hall, Tan acknowledged the need for difficult decisions to streamline Intel's operations. His leadership marks a shift toward aggressive restructuring and operational efficiency, signaling a departure from Intel's previous approach.\n\nINTC Price Action: Intel shares were up 1.54% at $26.08 at the time of writing, according to Benzinga pro.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage via Shutterstock.",

Now, it seems like we are finally coming closer to the time when XeSS 2 gets into action across multiple gaming titles, since Team Blue has officially released the XeSS 2 SDK, allowing a much easier implementation for developers of their respective gaming titles.\n\nThe XeSS 2 SDK is divided into three sub-categories: XeSS-SR, XeSS-FG and XeLL. Here's how Intel themselves describe this division, based on the information available on GitHub.\n\nXeSS Super Resolution (XeSS-SR) - boosts frame rates on all GPUs supporting SM6.4 (DP4A).\n\n- boosts frame rates on supporting SM6.4 (DP4A). XeSS Frame Generation (XeSS-FG) - achieves fluid motion and higher frame rates, available on Intel Arc GPUs with Intel\u00ae Xe Matrix eXtensions (XMX).\n\n- achieves fluid motion and higher frame rates, available on Intel Arc GPUs with Intel\u00ae Xe Matrix eXtensions (XMX). Xe Low Latency (XeLL) - minimizes input lag for a more responsive gaming experience, available on discrete and integrated Intel\u00ae Arc GPUs.\n\nDiving a bit into what to expect with XeSS 2, it now includes support for DirectX 11 and Vulkan APIs, further extending XeSS support for a range of games and older titles. The major difference with XeSS 2 is the way Team Blue has managed to integrate Frame-Gen, similar to NVIDIA's DLSS, although we still have to conclude on which one is superior. Interestingly, Intel's XeSS 2 SDKs come with plugins for Unreal Engine and Unity, which will allow for a very seamless integration and ultimately a higher adoption rate among developers.\n\nThere's also the updated version of the XeSS Inspector tool, which now works for the newer version and will debug and optimize XeSS 2 SDK integrations. While this certainly sounds great, a huge downside with XeSS 2.0 is Intel's closed-source approach, since, despite assurances, the firm is unable to deliver an open-sourced XeSS, which means that it cannot have a cross-platform implementation, or either a simplified dev integration like AMD's FSR.\n\nIntel's XeSS 2 still has a long way to go, given that it is only supported in a handful of titles, however, with the release of SDKs, we do expect enablement to improve.",

After a rough patch and a $19 billion loss in 2024, Tan is back to lead the charge, bringing his years of experience in chip design and tech investing. His mission? Overhaul Intel's chip manufacturing processes and AI strategy. He's eyeing significant restructuring, starting with cutting through Intel's bloated middle management and shifting gears on how the company handles its manufacturing, especially its Foundry business that serves major clients like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Tan's goal is clear: turn Intel into a top-tier foundry with the same competitive edge as rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM).\n\nTan's focus on AI and operational efficiency comes as Intel faces mounting pressure to regain its position in the semiconductor race. With a fresh eye on Intel's massive workforce and manufacturing capabilities, Tan is pushing hard to improve chip yields and attract new customers, including key players like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Intel's shift to advanced AI chips, leveraging new tech like the \"18A\" process, is poised to put the company back in the game. It's clear that Tan isn't just tweaking the old strategy; he's looking for a full-on reset with a focus on AI and next-gen chip tech.\n\nIntel's path to recovery will be about more than just cutting costs; it's about winning back customer trust and proving that its chips can compete with the best. Tan's leadership is a gamble, but if he pulls it off, Intel could see its manufacturing operations humming along with major clients coming on board for its next-gen AI products. This could be the start of something big for Intel, but investors should stay tuned to see if Tan's plan can deliver the goods.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

Tan plans to shift the company's approach to artificial intelligence (AI) and make significant staff cuts aimed at addressing a \"slow-moving and bloated middle management layer.\" Tan told employees last week that the company will need to make \"tough decisions,\" signaling he will take a more aggressive approach than his predecessor.\n\nAs part of the revamp, Tan's efforts will focus on Intel's manufacturing operations. The company's foundry business, which manufactures chips for external clients and has been a source of disappointment in recent years, will aggressively pursue new customers under Tan.\n\nTan's AI plans include producing chips that can better compete for uber-lucrative data center customers and expanding into software and robotics.\n\nThe changes are much needed\n\nIntel has struggled in the last few years, falling behind as the AI boom takes off. The company even reported its first annual loss in nearly 40 years last year.\n\nTan's plan presents a compelling vision, though many of its fruits could take several years to pay off, such as AI chips that can compete with rivals'. Still, I think Intel could be a contender in a few years' time, and given how much its stock has been beaten down in recent years, it is well valued.",

The major EDA companies \u2013 there are only three \u2013 have a somewhat unique position in the industry as they are the glue that holds together fabless semiconductor companies and the foundries that manufacture their chips. Intel, as an IDM, is both \u2013 it both designs and manufactures its own chips \u2013 and it will soon be a foundry, that is, it will manufacture chips for others, too.\n\nWhen Gelsinger left Intel in December, I worried that a suitably experienced CEO for Intel with both the requisite product and foundry experience did not exist. Tan, with his background in EDA, of course, has had a foot in both worlds for a long time.\n\nLip-Bu Tan (Source: Intel)\n\nWhile Gelsinger had an entire career of Intel experience, Tan knows Intel relatively well, both from his experience with Cadence and from having served on its board for two years (more on that below). One of my points was that anyone with sufficient industry experience would already be the CEO of a successful semiconductor company \u2013 and who would leave that kind of position to take on such a mammoth task at Intel? Tan, having retired from Cadence in 2021, fits the bill perfectly.\n\nPartner Content View All\n\nBy GLOBAL UNICHIP CORP. (GUC) 03.13.2025 By GigaDevice 03.11.2025 By Menta 03.06.2025\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Intel is facing is the question of whether the company should remain an IDM or should separate or spin out its foundry business. This would be a seismic change, effectively breaking the company in two, throwing out a key piece of what makes Intel Intel. The synergy and interplay between the product side of Intel and its foundry side is \u2013 or should be \u2013 a big part of the company\u2019s secret sauce.\n\nGelsinger\u2019s plan for Intel was centred around doubling down on the company\u2019s foundry business model, but this is a long term strategy and it seems Wall Street was too impatient to see it through. My fear for Intel was that a CEO would be brought in from outside the industry to \u201cslash and burn\u201d in order to improve Intel\u2019s short-term financials, potentially giving fuel to the idea of a product-foundry split. Tan\u2019s appointment suggests a split isn\u2019t what the board wants and therefore wasn\u2019t the issue that forced Gelsinger out.\n\nIn a letter to employees today, Tan said that under his leadership Intel will work hard to \u201crestore Intel\u2019s position as a world-class products company [and] establish ourselves as a world-class foundry\u201d, suggesting he understands and believes in Intel\u2019s rare advantage as an IDM. While these words are reassuring, the appointment of someone with a lifetime of serious industry credentials is a huge relief, not least because it means that if a split is inevitable, it will at least be for the right reasons.\n\nThat said, recent news out of Intel suggests the 18A process is on track, and work the company started under Gelsinger to develop PDKs (a recipe book for each process which allows non-Intel customers to use those processes) is underway. If anyone appreciates the importance of PDKs, it\u2019s the former CEO of Cadence, since they are effectively the interface between the process and customers\u2019 EDA tools.\n\nOn the product side, one of the biggest problems Intel is facing is its data center AI accelerator strategy, which has repeatedly failed to gather any momentum. Tan has experience here too, through his work with Walden International, the venture capital firm he founded in 1987. He was the founding chairman of enterprise AI company SambaNova and latterly took on an operational role as executive chairman. This exposure to the realities of AI hardware in the data center should stand him in good stead to make decisions about Intel\u2019s future in this regard.\n\nSome questions do remain. Tan served on Intel\u2019s board from September 2022 but quit in August 2024, reportedly after getting frustrated by Intel\u2019s bureaucratic culture, large workforce and its approach to contract manufacturing, which he felt was insufficiently customer-centric. What\u2019s unclear is whether Tan disagreed with Gelsinger on these points, or with the board. Either way, we can expect Tan to make large changes to Intel\u2019s workforce and its structure going forward.\n\nIntel\u2019s board has attracted a lot of criticism since Gelsinger\u2019s departure down to its members\u2019 lack of practical industry experience. Since then, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and former Microchip CEO Steve Sanghi, both semiconductor industry veterans, have joined. As Intel CEO, Tan will also rejoin. This should go some way to quelling criticism about the board\u2019s experience and motives.\n\nWhile I previously opined that Gelsinger was irreplaceable, perhaps this is the next best thing. It\u2019s heartening that the board has selected someone with unimpeachable industry and leadership experience that will hopefully appease both Intel customers and Wall Street, and that they have done so quickly. Turning around a ship the size of Intel will take years, and there is no time to waste.",

Here's when it may open Intel, the financially embattled chipmaker, has delayed the opening of its first Ohio factory to 2030 or 2031, multiple years after it was to open.\n\nCandidates vying to succeed Gov. Mike DeWine are less enthusiastic about Ohio's deal with Intel.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called for the repeal of the CHIPS Act, which was set to fund domestic microchip production.\n\nGov. Mike DeWine campaigned for reelection on bringing Intel jobs to Ohio.\n\nBut the microchip maker has delayed the opening of its first factory from 2025 to 2030 or 2031 as the company copes with its financial troubles and has fallen behind some of its closest competitors. A second Intel factory is now set to begin operations in 2032.\n\nBy the time Intel opens its first Ohio fab, term-limited DeWine will no longer be in the governor's mansion. And the candidates vying to be his successor are less sold on the deal.\n\nRepublican entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who entered the race with President Donald Trump's endorsement, said he's disappointed that Intel has delayed its New Albany semiconductor chip factory by several years.\n\n\u201cIntel has received a lot of federal money. They\u2019ve received a lot of state money predicated on commitments they made, and I do want to see them follow through on those commitments,\" Ramaswamy told the statehouse bureau.\n\nIf elected to replace DeWine, Ramaswamy said he would cut regulations, reduce taxes and address workforce shortages to make Ohio a place where businesses want to be.\n\n\"Giving out money willy-nilly is a band-aid solution,\" Ramaswamy, adding that the real solutions include a favorable regulatory and tax environment to spur business growth. \"And then once we have those nailed down, to have a leader of the state who markets the state to the rest of the country truthfully.\u201d\n\nOhio Attorney General Dave Yost, a Republican running to succeed DeWine, said the state needs to make better deals with businesses to avoid what happened with Intel. He has been critical of JobsOhio, the state's private, nonprofit development corporation.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m governor, the development deals that the state does will have real, objective criteria that will be enforceable with proper clawback provisions,\" Yost said.\n\nOhio has little power to claw back the $600 million it's given Intel to help with the construction of its two factories, Yost contends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so broad, you could drive an 18-wheeler through it,\" he said. \"It\u2019s not very enforceable.\u201d\n\nAmy Acton, the lone Democrat who has announced she's running for governor, said deals like the one expected to bring Intel to Ohio need to be far more transparent when \"tax dollars and so many jobs are at stake.\" Acton said she'd push to bring more jobs like those Intel promised to Ohio if elected governor.\n\n\"Ohioans across the state are struggling, and this project has the potential to strengthen supply chains and bring costs down,\" Acton said. \"We need to get it done.\"\n\nIs support for CHIPS Act crumbling?\n\nPresident Donald Trump called for Congress to repeal the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which was set to dole out $7.865 billion in funding to Intel to make microchips in America.\n\nAt the end of February, the company had so far received $2.2 billion of its CHIPS Act funding. At least $1.5 billion of the total was set to go toward the New Albany project, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nRamaswamy said he predicted the CHIPS Act would fall short of its promises.\n\n\"I wish I had been wrong, but sadly, the truth is it hasn\u2019t lived up to its expectations of what it was supposed to do,\" Ramaswamy said. \u201cWhat\u2019s driven the boom in the CHIPS industry has been not the CHIPS Act, it\u2019s been the boom in demand for the chips from the AI boom that has since followed.\u201d\n\nYost said he initially supported the CHIPS Act because it was important to bring Intel jobs to Ohio. Now, he's disappointed the company hasn't held up its end of the bargain. \u201cIntel\u2019s in trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn so many cases, the government backs up the government dump truck full of cash and just empties the bed and hopes for the best,\" Yost said. \"That\u2019s a horrible way to do business.\u201d\n\nDespite Trump's call to eliminate the CHIPS Act, Sen. Jon Husted said he believes the law still has bipartisan support in Congress.\n\nHusted, as lieutenant governor, played a pivotal role in helping attract Intel to the state. However, Husted has long been critical of how much time it took the Biden administration to begin awarding Intel its money.\n\n\"I believe this is part of an America First agenda,\" Husted previously said in a prepared statement. \"Making chips in places like Ohio will make sure that China doesn\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nJessie Balmert covers state government and politics for the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau, which serves the Columbus Dispatch, Cincinnati Enquirer, Akron Beacon Journal and 18 other affiliated news organizations across Ohio.",

The map above shows 38 counties.\n\n\u201cBefore Intel announced plans to build in Ohio, we had about 150 suppliers in the state,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSince announcing the Ohio One project, we now have more than 350 suppliers.\n\n\u201cSome of our suppliers will be located very close to our campus due to the need for close proximity, but many of the suppliers won\u2019t need to be so close.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the opportunity Jeff Gottke sees for Knox County.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Knox County will see transistors and silicon wafer companies because those are expensive to build and I\u2019m guessing they have to be very close to the facility in New Albany,\u201d said the president of the Knox County Area Development Foundation.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very possible that we support HVAC parts, duct work or any machine parts that make the semiconductors.\u201d\n\nWhat does Tier 1, 2 and 3 Supplier mean? An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) designs and oversees the final product. An OEM is at the top of a supply chain pyramid. Tier 1 suppliers manufacture and supply components or systems directly to the OEM. Tier 2 suppliers provide materials to Tier 1 suppliers. They usually make specialized components. Tier 3 suppliers specialize in raw materials and basic components that they sell to Tier 2 suppliers. Source: Metrikflow\n\nGottke noted Knox County has limited shovel-ready sites for new companies, including Fredericktown Industrial Park and Heartland Commerce Park.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important for companies looking for new space is speed to market, so how quickly they can get up and running,\u201d Gottke said. \u201cThey\u2019d want either a spec building or shovel-ready site with utilities. To remain competitive in the manufacturing sphere, we need more shovel-ready sites.\u201d\n\nManufacturing business leaders and educators discuss in-demand jobs with then-Lt. Gov. Jon Husted at Goyal Industries May 10, 2024.\n\nOhio semiconductor suppliers also support biotechnology, other industries\n\nBarrett Thomas, senior director of economic development for the Richland Area Chamber, said site development and supply chain buildouts are a long process.\n\n\u201cWhen you put this in the context of Honda in Marysville, that supply chain took 30 years to build out,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think the semiconductor supply chain will move faster than the auto supply chain, but it still takes time to aggregate the land, infrastructure, and have it in place to present to a company when you\u2019re talking site development.\u201d\n\nThomas said he thinks Richland County could support Tier 3 suppliers, or potentially Tier 2.\n\n\u201cFor Intel in particular, I would say nothing\u2019s ready to go yet in our area, but the more pieces we have in place, the more opportunity we have there,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why site control is so important, either through public or public-private ownership. Speed, risk and money relates to every site decision when you\u2019re looking at land to build on as a company, so the more you have in place ready to go is how you win long-term.\u201d\n\nMatt Englehart, communications manager for JobsOhio, noted semiconductor suppliers usually support other industries beyond chip manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWhile central Ohio is well positioned for supply chain growth, there are more semiconductor suppliers outside of central Ohio than in it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is due in part to Ohio\u2019s rich history of manufacturing.\n\n\u201cMany semiconductor suppliers support other industries, such as biotechnology and healthcare, smart manufacturing, smart mobility, IoT (Internet of Things, logistics) and energy.\u201d\n\nSemiconductor chips require millions of transistors, as well as silicon wafers, metals and a lithographing and etching process.\n\nIntel is actively seeking Ohio suppliers, listing categories of logistics and transportation, human resources, factory metals, marketing, computing and prototype testing on its website.\n\nFro Sand to Silicon: The Making of a Microchip\n\n\u201cOhio\u2019s rich industrial history, combined with its forward-looking economic development efforts, positions it as a prime destination for a range of high-tech industries,\u201d said Intel Communications Manager Elly Akopyan.\n\n\u201cRegions like Knox County bring valuable assets that can support industries critical to the semiconductor ecosystem, from glass fabrication to advanced materials and precision manufacturing.\u201d\n\nSherwood, Oregon \u2014 which Knox Pages reporters visited in October 2024 \u2014 hosts an 80,000-square-foot DWFritz location that manufactures precision automation systems and a 45,000-square foot space for development firm Lam Research, a Fortune 500 company with a variety of microchip products.\n\nDWFritz operates in Sherwood Commerce Center. Lam Research in Sherwood, Oregon\n\nMost of the semiconductor and integrated circuit suppliers in Washington County, Oregon are located in Hillsboro closest to Intel\u2019s four campuses.\n\nLam Research is headquartered in California and DWFritz in Wilsonville, Oregon. Those companies opened Sherwood locations just in the past three years in the city\u2019s new TualatinSherwood Corporate Park.\n\nOlympus Controls recently opened a 70,000-square-foot facility in Sherwood, where it builds industrial robotics, motion control, CNC automation systems and more.\n\nAccording to the corporate responsibility report, about 45% of Intel\u2019s suppliers were located in North, Central and South Americas as of 2023. Asia and Pacific Islands suppliers made up about 30% of the supply chain.",

            "content": "Broncos can gain intel on Oregon draft prospects from Bo Nix\n\nAfter using their first-round pick to select Oregon quarterback Bo Nix in last year's NFL draft, the Broncos later added his teammate in the fourth round, bringing in Ducks wide receiver Troy Franklin.\n\nIt's possible that Denver could reunite Nix with more ex-college teammates this spring as Oregon has several draft prospects in this year's class.\n\nPerhaps most notable among them from a Broncos perspective is tight end Terrance Ferguson, a Denver native. Other Ducks who could interest the Broncos include wide receiver Tez Johnson and running back Jordan James. Denver met with all three at the NFL combine, and Nix can provide feedback during the scouting process.\n\n\u201cIt would be very common for us in a draft meeting \u2014 and let\u2019s say it\u2019s Oregon \u2014 and we will be looking at a player and I may shoot a text to one of those guys to ask, \u2018Tell me what you guys think,'\" coach Sean Payton said at the NFL combine. \"Maybe there is a call just while we are watching the film. If we are looking at a TCU player, I\u2019m texting my son, who worked there as a student assistant. If we are looking at a Penn State [player], etcetera. That would be very common. Then the follow up in the locker room more specifically or talk to me more. Then it continues. You are gathering as much information as you can to help be as accurate as you can on the decision-making process.\n\n\"[Last year], we were there at the [Oregon] pro day, but the next day was the private workout. You have to pay close attention. It was interesting to see how many of [Nix's] teammates \u2014 they had just finished working out Friday, and here it was Saturday morning and here is another 10. You just pay attention to all of it. The young running back is tugging on my coat tails throughout the day and saying, \u2018I got to know Alvin Kamara.\u2019 He\u2019s a good football player, and he and I were chatting. Six months later, you are defending him and he\u2019s a pain in your rear. [I\u2019m] talking about Bucky [Irving]. It says a lot about the player though at his own day when so many guys showed up.\u201d\n\nJohnson was taken in by Nix's family when he was 15 years old, and he considers the quarterback his brother. Some Broncos fans have fallen in love with Johnson as a prospect, but his small frame (5-9, 156 pounds) might cause him to fall in the draft.\n\n\u201cRelative to that, you do all your research,\" Payton said when asked abut Johnson's size. \"He\u2019s played with a chip on his shoulder his entire career, and that is a credit to him. You evaluate the player and you look at the vision and try to come up with the vision. Then you discuss who he is like and then you go from there.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos currently hold seven draft picks. We'll find out next month if Payton and Co. are able to add any more former Ducks to the squad.",

Intel\u2019s shares rose more than 15 per cent after the announcement. Tan, Intel said, is an accomplished technology leader with deep semiconductor industry experience. He will be CEO effective March 18 and succeeds interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus.\n\nThe Malaysian-born, Singapore-raised naturalised American had been CEO of chip design software firm Cadence Design Systems, where his leadership qualities stood out as he lifted the fortunes of the company. The question is whether he will be able to replicate the success at troubled Intel \u2014 especially as he is up against stiff competition from Jensen Huang-led Nvidia and Lisa Su-led AMD. He has already told Intel employees that \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy\u201d. But his mantra of \u201cStay humble, work hard, delight our customers\u201d is a sound one.\n\nIncrements will be low\n\nIt\u2019s grim news for employees on the pay front. Deloitte India Talent Outlook 2025 says there is a clear focus among companies on optimising compensation cost budgets, with pay increases for 2025 being forecast at 8.8 per cent (compared with 9 per cent in 2024). The survey shows 75 per cent of companies will either reduce or keep their pay increases the same as last year. Furthermore, while most sectors will keep the increment growth stable or moderately less than the previous year, the consumer products sector expects a significantly lower increment budget.\n\nOf course, companies will try to retain top performers, but even they will get a moderately lower increment compared to last year. Top performers can expect a 1.7x higher increment than average performers. Most companies expect to not increase their promotion-linked pay hikes compared with previous years.\n\nPrakhar Tripathi, Partner, Deloitte India, said, \u201cIn an environment where companies are witnessing muted revenue growth, compensation budgets are naturally coming under pressure.\u201d",

Additionally, he is eligible for about $66 million in stock options and grants tied to his performance over the next few years.\n\nTan, a seasoned chip industry veteran and longtime tech investor, was named Intel's CEO last week, replacing Pat Gelsinger, who stepped down in December. According to a report by CNBC, Tan's appointment has already given Intel's stock a boost, with shares rising nearly 20% in 2025, largely driven by investor optimism following the announcement.\n\nThe bulk of Tan's compensation comes in the form of long-term equity awards. He'll receive $14.4 million in stock units and a $17 million performance grant, both vesting over five years. However, Tan won't see a penny of those shares if Intel's stock price drops over the next three years. On the flip side, he could earn even more if the company outperforms the market.\n\nTan's contract also includes a $9.6 million stock option package and a $25 million new-hire grant. In a show of confidence, Tan has agreed to personally buy $25 million worth of Intel shares and hold them to qualify for these awards.\n\nOne notable clause in Tan's contract is the \"change in control\" provision, which allows him to keep two-thirds of his stock awards if Intel undergoes a significant ownership shift within 18 months of his joining. This clause wasn't part of Gelsinger's agreement, highlighting the unique challenges Tan faces as he takes the helm of the struggling chipmaker.\n\nIn an email, Intel described Tan's compensation as \"market competitive\", emphasising that the majority of his pay is tied to long-term shareholder value creation, as per the report by CNBC. The company is betting big on Tan's deep industry expertise and track record as a tech investor to turn around its fortunes.\n\nTan, who remains actively involved with startups through his venture capital firm Walden International, will officially start as CEO on March 18. His mission? To steer Intel through its rocky transition into a successful chip manufacturer and design powerhouse. With millions on the line, all eyes will be on Tan to deliver.",

Here's when it may open Intel, the financially embattled chipmaker, has delayed the opening of its first Ohio factory to 2030 or 2031, multiple years after it was to open.\n\nIntel has delayed the opening of its first Ohio chip factory to 2030 or 2031, five or six years later than originally planned.\n\nOther companies, including TSMC and Qualcomm, have reportedly considered acquiring part or all of Intel.\n\nIndustry experts say Intel has fallen behind competitors in the chip market and needs to make significant strides to catch up.\n\nWhen Intel broke ground on its $28-billion factories in New Albany, the company planned to begin production of microchips in Ohio in 2025.\n\nBut following one delay after another and continued financial problems, Intel has delayed the completion and opening of its first chip factory to 2030 or 2031. A second fab is set to now open in 2032.\n\nThe delays mean the first factory won't open until at least five or six years after it was expected to be operational in 2025. On top of the latest delays, President Donald Trump has also called on Congress to repeal the CHIPS and Science Act, legislation that is helping to fund Intel's new Ohio One factories.\n\nWith all the headlines the chipmaker garnered the last few weeks, The Dispatch took questions from readers during an \"Ask Us Anything\" online townhall this week on Reddit.\n\nHere are the biggest questions readers had and what we know.\n\nHave other companies expressed interest in buying Intel?\n\nAt this point, it's anyone's guess whether it will be Intel eventually running the chip plants in New Albany or another company altogether.\n\nAs recently as this week, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) pitched U.S. chip designers Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom about taking stakes in a joint venture to operate Intel's factories, Reuters reported. Under the proposal, TSMC would operate the factories.\n\nThe development was hardly the first report of other companies eyeing part or all of Intel's business.\n\nRead More: Is Intel in trouble? How struggling chipmaker's financial issues may impact Ohio factories\n\nAlong with TSMC, Broadcom was said to be looking at acquiring Intel's chip design and marketing business.\n\nPresident Donald Trump also previously asked TSMC to consider taking a controlling interest in Intel. San Diego-based Qualcomm has also considered buying Intel.\n\nAnd rumors swirled a month or two ago about whether Elon Musk, the world's richest man and leader of Tesla and SpaceX might be interested in buying Intel. Musk is currently heading up Trump's Department of Government Efficiency initiative to slash federal spending.\n\nWill CHIPS Act cash still materialize for Intel?\n\nIntel was one of several companies that stood to receive billions of dollars in federal funding from the bipartisan CHIPS Act signed into law by former President Joe Biden.\n\nBut, in a joint address to Congress earlier this month, Trump called the CHIPS Act a \"horrible, horrible thing\" and suggested to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson that Congress do away with the law.\n\nIt's unclear whether Congress will act on Trump's request. But, Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio, has told The Dispatch he believes there is still bipartisan support for the CHIPS Act and that it will likely remain in place.\n\nIntel has received $2.2 billion of its $7.865 billion in funding as part of the federal CHIPS Incentives Program. At least $1.5 billion of that funding was set to go toward the New Albany project, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nDan Tierney, spokesperson for Gov. Mike DeWine, said the governor's office will keep an eye on whether Congress takes action on the CHIPS Act. But, Tierney pointed out that Intel's leaders previously said they would have pursued the company's Ohio One plants even without federal funding.\n\nWill Ohio claw back any state funding for Intel's New Albany fabs?\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the state of Ohio will try to claw back any of the funding it's awarded Intel for its chip factories.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Development has an agreement with the company, which states $300 million in grants were made available to help with the construction of each factory completed by the end of 2028. That money was paid out in September 2023, according to the state.\n\nPolicy experts on both sides of the aisle have called for accountability for Intel following its delays and the fallout from its financial problems.\n\nRead More: Intel already spent billions on delayed New Albany chip factory, new report reveals\n\nZach Schiller, research director at Policy Matters Ohio, a left-leaning think tank with offices in Columbus and Cleveland, said that the trouble with Intel is \"more than just noise.\" Officials should require Intel to annually report the number of jobs its Ohio plants have created along with other metrics such as capital invested, Schiller previously told The Dispatch.\n\nAt the same time, Greg Lawson, a researcher at the right-leaning think tank The Buckeye Institute said the state should enforce its agreement with Intel given how much money it put on the table.\n\n\"You need to have easily enforceable claw backs because what happens in 10 years? Is whoever is in the governor's mansion then really going to do that?\" Lawson said in February.\n\nWhat about the colleges and schools that already started preparing for Intel?\n\nSince Intel announced it was coming to Ohio, local colleges and school districts have begun retooling programs and training students to join the workforce the company will need when its factories open.\n\nIn 2022, Intel said it would give $17.7 million over three years to fund research and training at more than 80 Ohio colleges and universities.\n\nOne Columbus CEO Kenny McDonald said in February that he's not worried about how the latest delay will impact this research and training locally. He encouraged colleges to stay the course in preparation for the factories.\n\nWhen Intel's factories are fully up and running, the Ohio One site is expected to employ around 3,000 workers. As of Dec. 31, Intel's Ohio operation had 163 employees, including 156 who live in Ohio and 7 employees who don't live in the state, according to the chipmaker.\n\nDo industry experts think Intel itself can survive to 2030?\n\nDepending on what happens over the next five years, Intel could look a lot different in 2030 than it does today.\n\nIntel has fallen behind some of its closest competitors and it will take a lot for the chip maker to catch back up with them, experts have told The Dispatch.\n\nChipmakers Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., NVIDIA, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. have all pulled ahead of Intel, which largely exited the smartphone market years ago, Brady Wang, an associate director at Counterpoint, a Hong Kong-based technology market research firm previously said.\n\nAt the same time, Intel also lags competitors in artificial intelligence \u2014a sector that's growing rapidly right now. Until Intel gains ground in AI, it will struggle to compete, both Wang Counterpoint senior analyst Jeongku Choi have said.\n\n\"Investing in leading edge fabs is a no-brainer to survive,\" Wang said. \"It\u2018s the only way to regain the confidence of their customers.\u201d\n\nmfilby@dispatch.com\n\n@MaxFilby",

            "content": "//php echo do_shortcode('[responsivevoice_button voice=\"US English Male\" buttontext=\"Listen to Post\"]') ?>\n\nAfter unceremoniously ousting Pat Gelsinger as CEO in December, ailing chipmaker Intel has appointed industry veteran and longtime Cadence CEO Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO.\n\nTan comes from the world of EDA, having served as Cadence CEO from 2009 to 2021. The major EDA companies \u2013 there are only three \u2013 have a somewhat unique position in the industry as they are the glue that holds together fabless semiconductor companies and the foundries that manufacture their chips. Intel, as an IDM, is both \u2013 it both designs and manufactures its own chips \u2013 and it will soon be a foundry, that is, it will manufacture chips for others, too.\n\nWhen Gelsinger left Intel in December, I worried that a suitably experienced CEO for Intel with both the requisite product and foundry experience did not exist. Tan, with his background in EDA, of course, has had a foot in both worlds for a long time.\n\nLip-Bu Tan (Source: Intel)\n\nWhile Gelsinger had an entire career of Intel experience, Tan knows Intel relatively well, both from his experience with Cadence and from having served on its board for two years (more on that below). One of my points was that anyone with sufficient industry experience would already be the CEO of a successful semiconductor company \u2013 and who would leave that kind of position to take on such a mammoth task at Intel? Tan, having retired from Cadence in 2021, fits the bill perfectly.\n\nPartner Content View All\n\nBy GLOBAL UNICHIP CORP. (GUC) 03.13.2025 By GigaDevice 03.11.2025 By Menta 03.06.2025\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Intel is facing is the question of whether the company should remain an IDM or should separate or spin out its foundry business. This would be a seismic change, effectively breaking the company in two, throwing out a key piece of what makes Intel Intel. The synergy and interplay between the product side of Intel and its foundry side is \u2013 or should be \u2013 a big part of the company\u2019s secret sauce.\n\nGelsinger\u2019s plan for Intel was centred around doubling down on the company\u2019s foundry business model, but this is a long term strategy and it seems Wall Street was too impatient to see it through. My fear for Intel was that a CEO would be brought in from outside the industry to \u201cslash and burn\u201d in order to improve Intel\u2019s short-term financials, potentially giving fuel to the idea of a product-foundry split. Tan\u2019s appointment suggests a split isn\u2019t what the board wants and therefore wasn\u2019t the issue that forced Gelsinger out.\n\nIn a letter to employees today, Tan said that under his leadership Intel will work hard to \u201crestore Intel\u2019s position as a world-class products company [and] establish ourselves as a world-class foundry\u201d, suggesting he understands and believes in Intel\u2019s rare advantage as an IDM. While these words are reassuring, the appointment of someone with a lifetime of serious industry credentials is a huge relief, not least because it means that if a split is inevitable, it will at least be for the right reasons.\n\nThat said, recent news out of Intel suggests the 18A process is on track, and work the company started under Gelsinger to develop PDKs (a recipe book for each process which allows non-Intel customers to use those processes) is underway. If anyone appreciates the importance of PDKs, it\u2019s the former CEO of Cadence, since they are effectively the interface between the process and customers\u2019 EDA tools.\n\nOn the product side, one of the biggest problems Intel is facing is its data center AI accelerator strategy, which has repeatedly failed to gather any momentum. Tan has experience here too, through his work with Walden International, the venture capital firm he founded in 1987. He was the founding chairman of enterprise AI company SambaNova and latterly took on an operational role as executive chairman. This exposure to the realities of AI hardware in the data center should stand him in good stead to make decisions about Intel\u2019s future in this regard.\n\nSome questions do remain. Tan served on Intel\u2019s board from September 2022 but quit in August 2024, reportedly after getting frustrated by Intel\u2019s bureaucratic culture, large workforce and its approach to contract manufacturing, which he felt was insufficiently customer-centric. What\u2019s unclear is whether Tan disagreed with Gelsinger on these points, or with the board. Either way, we can expect Tan to make large changes to Intel\u2019s workforce and its structure going forward.\n\nIntel\u2019s board has attracted a lot of criticism since Gelsinger\u2019s departure down to its members\u2019 lack of practical industry experience. Since then, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and former Microchip CEO Steve Sanghi, both semiconductor industry veterans, have joined. As Intel CEO, Tan will also rejoin. This should go some way to quelling criticism about the board\u2019s experience and motives.\n\nWhile I previously opined that Gelsinger was irreplaceable, perhaps this is the next best thing. It\u2019s heartening that the board has selected someone with unimpeachable industry and leadership experience that will hopefully appease both Intel customers and Wall Street, and that they have done so quickly. Turning around a ship the size of Intel will take years, and there is no time to waste.",

The news of Tan's appointment, effective next Tuesday, has invigorated investor confidence, fueling speculation about possible strategic shifts in Intel's foundry business.\n\nShares of Intel have surged nearly 17% this week, closing at $24.05 on Friday. Analysts at Deutsche Bank regard the leadership change as a \"desirable outcome\" for the chipmaker, praising Tan's extensive expertise in the semiconductor landscape. Meanwhile, Bank of America analysts have suggested that Tan may pave the way for a transformative strategy within the foundry segment, amidst ongoing acquisition rumors.\n\nEarlier, speculation intensified about the future of Intel's foundry business when Reuters reported potential collaboration talks with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) about forming a joint venture with notable industry players like Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO). Such a partnership could potentially strengthen Intel's position within the U.S. semiconductor industry.\n\nThis positive development marks a notable recovery for Intel's stock, which has experienced a 20% increase in 2025, positioning it as the top-performing chip stock on the S&P 500 so far this year. This rebound is a welcome change following a challenging 2024, where the company's stock lost more than half of its value.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

The major EDA companies \u2013 there are only three \u2013 have a somewhat unique position in the industry as they are the glue that holds together fabless semiconductor companies and the foundries that manufacture their chips. Intel, as an IDM, is both \u2013 it both designs and manufactures its own chips \u2013 and it will soon be a foundry, that is, it will manufacture chips for others, too.\n\nWhen Gelsinger left Intel in December, I worried that a suitably experienced CEO for Intel with both the requisite product and foundry experience did not exist. Tan, with his background in EDA, of course, has had a foot in both worlds for a long time.\n\nLip-Bu Tan (Source: Intel)\n\nWhile Gelsinger had an entire career of Intel experience, Tan knows Intel relatively well, both from his experience with Cadence and from having served on its board for two years (more on that below). One of my points was that anyone with sufficient industry experience would already be the CEO of a successful semiconductor company \u2013 and who would leave that kind of position to take on such a mammoth task at Intel? Tan, having retired from Cadence in 2021, fits the bill perfectly.\n\nPartner Content View All\n\nBy GLOBAL UNICHIP CORP. (GUC) 03.13.2025 By GigaDevice 03.11.2025 By Menta 03.06.2025\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Intel is facing is the question of whether the company should remain an IDM or should separate or spin out its foundry business. This would be a seismic change, effectively breaking the company in two, throwing out a key piece of what makes Intel Intel. The synergy and interplay between the product side of Intel and its foundry side is \u2013 or should be \u2013 a big part of the company\u2019s secret sauce.\n\nGelsinger\u2019s plan for Intel was centred around doubling down on the company\u2019s foundry business model, but this is a long term strategy and it seems Wall Street was too impatient to see it through. My fear for Intel was that a CEO would be brought in from outside the industry to \u201cslash and burn\u201d in order to improve Intel\u2019s short-term financials, potentially giving fuel to the idea of a product-foundry split. Tan\u2019s appointment suggests a split isn\u2019t what the board wants and therefore wasn\u2019t the issue that forced Gelsinger out.\n\nIn a letter to employees today, Tan said that under his leadership Intel will work hard to \u201crestore Intel\u2019s position as a world-class products company [and] establish ourselves as a world-class foundry\u201d, suggesting he understands and believes in Intel\u2019s rare advantage as an IDM. While these words are reassuring, the appointment of someone with a lifetime of serious industry credentials is a huge relief, not least because it means that if a split is inevitable, it will at least be for the right reasons.\n\nThat said, recent news out of Intel suggests the 18A process is on track, and work the company started under Gelsinger to develop PDKs (a recipe book for each process which allows non-Intel customers to use those processes) is underway. If anyone appreciates the importance of PDKs, it\u2019s the former CEO of Cadence, since they are effectively the interface between the process and customers\u2019 EDA tools.\n\nOn the product side, one of the biggest problems Intel is facing is its data center AI accelerator strategy, which has repeatedly failed to gather any momentum. Tan has experience here too, through his work with Walden International, the venture capital firm he founded in 1987. He was the founding chairman of enterprise AI company SambaNova and latterly took on an operational role as executive chairman. This exposure to the realities of AI hardware in the data center should stand him in good stead to make decisions about Intel\u2019s future in this regard.\n\nSome questions do remain. Tan served on Intel\u2019s board from September 2022 but quit in August 2024, reportedly after getting frustrated by Intel\u2019s bureaucratic culture, large workforce and its approach to contract manufacturing, which he felt was insufficiently customer-centric. What\u2019s unclear is whether Tan disagreed with Gelsinger on these points, or with the board. Either way, we can expect Tan to make large changes to Intel\u2019s workforce and its structure going forward.\n\nIntel\u2019s board has attracted a lot of criticism since Gelsinger\u2019s departure down to its members\u2019 lack of practical industry experience. Since then, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and former Microchip CEO Steve Sanghi, both semiconductor industry veterans, have joined. As Intel CEO, Tan will also rejoin. This should go some way to quelling criticism about the board\u2019s experience and motives.\n\nWhile I previously opined that Gelsinger was irreplaceable, perhaps this is the next best thing. It\u2019s heartening that the board has selected someone with unimpeachable industry and leadership experience that will hopefully appease both Intel customers and Wall Street, and that they have done so quickly. Turning around a ship the size of Intel will take years, and there is no time to waste.",

There\u2019s no need to despair, though, as there are plenty of great-value options up for grabs if you look further afield. Enter Intel\u2019s Core i5-13400.\n\nOver on Amazon US, you\u2019ll find Core i5-13400 for $134.98. The cost of this CPU has steadily declined since its launch, now $86.02 (39%) below its launch price. It\u2019s just a few pennies shy of its lowest ever price too, but you shouldn\u2019t let that detract from the deal on offer now if you want my two cents.\n\nTarinder\u2019s verdict on Core i5-13400F, \u201ca thoroughly fine processor primed for mainstream upgrades or fresh builds\u201d, rings true for Core i5-13400 too. The two CPUs are essentially the same save for the addition of integrated graphics on the latter model, allowing you to put your motherboard\u2019s display outputs to work.\n\nDrilling down into the technical makeup of Core i5-13400, it packs 6 Performance-cores and 4 Efficient-cores for 10 cores total alongside 16 threads. Its P-cores run at a base clock of 2.5GHz and can boost up to a maximum of 4.6GHz. Translating these raw specifications into real-world performance, the chip provides a pleasing package that contains just about everything you need from a CPU to a high standard.\n\nPurchasing Core i5-13400 has value implications outside of the processor itself, namely concerning cooling and platform costs. Intel pairs this CPU with a stock air cooler that will keep the chip plenty cool under load, freeing you to spend your budget elsewhere. Of course, if you already have an LGA1700 compatible cooler then it\u2019ll slot in without a fuss.\n\nIn terms of motherboards, Core i5-13400 is compatible with B/H/Z700 Series chipsets out of the box. You can pair it with B/H/Z600 Series models too following a BIOS update. As you browse the wide selection of boards, be sure to note whether your preferred choice supports DDR5 or DRR4 RAM.",

The company entered the market late, facing Nvidia\u2019s dominant CUDA ecosystem and AMD\u2019s aggressive push into AI GPUs.\n\n\u201cTan\u2019s background suggests he is unlikely to double down on discrete GPUs at all costs,\u201d Singh said. \u201cHe understands that the real AI war is not just about GPUs, but about AI-first compute architectures. The companies that succeed in AI computing are those that embed AI capabilities across all their silicon, not just in a dedicated GPU line.\u201d\n\nIntel has already integrated AI acceleration into its CPUs, a strategy Singh sees as Tan\u2019s likely focus. Rather than chasing Nvidia, Intel may embed AI directly into CPUs and other processors, providing enterprises a scalable AI solution without requiring a full GPU redesign.\n\nStill, discrete GPUs are unlikely to vanish entirely. \u201cCertain workloads will continue to demand dedicated AI processors, and Intel may still pursue this space,\u201d Singh said. \u201cBut the difference under Tan will be an emphasis on AI computing as a whole, rather than a myopic race to compete with Nvidia in the GPU market alone.\u201d\n\nIntel\u2019s broader AI investments reflect this diversified approach. \u201cGaudi, as an example, is not a GPU,\u201d said Paquet. \u201cIt is an AI accelerator, not a general-purpose GPU.

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nOn Wednesday, the NBA slapped the Utah Jazz with a $100,000 fine for violating the league's player participation policy for sitting star Lauri Markkanen in a game last week in Washington \"as well as other recent games.\"\n\nMarkkanen had missed nine straight games with various ailments, and the league reached the conclusion he had actually been able to play. In other words, the team appeared guilty of blatant tanking. It was working, too; the Jazz lost eight of the nine games.\n\nShortly after the fine was levied, the Jazz updated their injury report to declare Markkanen available to play that night against the Memphis Grizzlies. The Jazz lost again anyway.\n\nThe same night, in a high-value tank game in Toronto, the Raptors started two rookies, a two-way player and a player on a 10-day contract and still beat the Philadelphia 76ers, who had more than $140 million in salaries on the inactive list. As a result, Toronto moved ahead of the 76ers in the actual standings, but Philadelphia moved into a tie for fifth in the NBA's draft lottery standings, a vital development for a 76ers team that needs its draft pick to land inside the top six to keep it.\n\n\"Right now there are nine teams tanking,\" one league executive said. \"And next year's draft is going to have maybe more franchise players than this year's draft. A year from now, you may still have nine teams tanking.\"\n\nLet's dive into the next steps for a handful of those teams -- the seven with the best odds at the No. 1 overall pick, according to ESPN's Basketball Power Index (BPI) -- as we canvass the league for intel on the franchises that will matter most leading up to the May lottery and June draft.\n\nJump to a team:\n\nRaptors | Nets\n\n76ers | Pelicans\n\nHornets | Jazz\n\nWizards\n\nBPI draft odds\n\nNo. 1 pick: 9.2%\n\nTop 3 pick: 27.5%\n\nTop 5 pick: 38.0%\n\nWindhorst: The Nets made their intentions clear last summer when they made an inventive trade with the Houston Rockets to reacquire control of their 2025 and 2026 first-round picks after they'd used them to acquire James Harden in 2021. Actions over words, the Nets clearly felt by getting both picks that they might need to have a two-year \"rebuild\" even though they are in position to improve this summer, when they could have more than $60 million in cap space.\n\n\"They're going to use it in trade because they're not going to have anyone to pay in this free agent market,\" a rival executive said. \"They could end up right back in this spot next year.\"\n\nBontemps: That trade with Houston will enable the Nets to do something they have yet to do since they arrived in Brooklyn ahead of the 2012-13 season: make a draft pick in the lottery. In fact, this year's pick will be the first time the Nets have a selection inside the top 20 since moving inside the five boroughs.\n\nBut while the franchise remains in the nascent stages of its rebuild, league insiders I spoke to this week have praised rookie coach Jordi Fernandez, who has done a terrific job getting a team short on talent to be competitive on a nightly basis. \"If you're the Nets, the thing you're excited about is Jordi,\" an executive said.\n\nBPI draft odds\n\nNo. 1 pick: 7.5%\n\nTop 3 pick: 22.7%\n\nTop 5 pick: 31.3%\n\nWindhorst: Actions over words again, as the Raptors' trade for Brandon Ingram and decision to give him a $120 million extension in \"pre-agency\" makes Toronto's intentions clear. The franchise is hoping this season, which has been derailed by various injuries to key players, can yield a high draft pick, and then the Raptors can make a pivot next season with Ingram and Scottie Barnes as cornerstones.\n\nBontemps: When the Raptors moved on from Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby last season via trade, combined with letting Fred Van Vleet walk in free agency and firing coach Nick Nurse, it was clear the franchise was moving into a new era. It was also clear the Raptors were trying to make their dip out of the playoff mix in the East as short and painless as possible.\n\nThey landed Immanuel Quickley in the Anunoby trade and gave him a big contract last summer to make him the team's long-term starting point guard. They then did the same thing with Ingram last month and are now doing everything they can to maximize their lottery odds -- although having the league's easiest remaining schedule is continuing to wreak havoc with those plans.\n\nWindhorst: Of interest when evaluating the Raptors' short-term future is control of the franchise. Last fall, Edward Rogers, the chairman of Canadian firm Rogers Communications, executed a deal that increased the company's stake in the Raptors' parent company to 75%. Next year, he has the right to buy out current governor Larry Tannenbaum's ownership shares and have full control of the franchise. Just where the Raptors are when that transaction takes place is already a source of both intrigue around the NBA and stress within an organization missing its third straight postseason.\n\nBontemps: Pulling off such a quick turnaround is not easy. And while so much of whether it will work or not will hinge on whether the Raptors get some lottery luck this spring, their approach has been met with some skepticism around the league.\n\n\"I don't like what Toronto is doing,\" another executive said. \"Trying to flip it quick is dangerous.\"\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers (22-43)\n\nBPI draft odds\n\nNo. 1 pick: 10.4%\n\nTop 3 pick: 31.0%\n\nTop 5 pick: 43.3%\n\nBontemps: After their offseason splashes, it's remarkable that Philadelphia has a reasonable chance of hanging on to its draft pick. Due to the 76ers dropping 16 of their past 19 games, they are now projected to finish with the league's fifth-worst record, which would give them a better-than-60% chance of hanging on to their top-six-protected first-rounder.\n\nFor as disastrous as this season has been for the 76ers, if it results in them keeping their pick -- let alone landing Cooper Flagg if they secure the top selection for the first time since drafting Ben Simmons in 2016 -- it would make things look dramatically different in a hurry.\n\nWindhorst: Obviously it's a shocking situation for the 76ers to be focusing on protecting their draft pick rather than chasing a top seed in this year's playoffs. With Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey costing $145 million next season, the hope is health will return and with a new draft pick the 76ers are back on track. However ...\n\n\"Until they know what is happening with Embiid, there is no way to project what they will be next year,\" a league executive said. \"They will have a hard time changing that roster.\"\n\nBontemps: There continues to be no update on Embiid's situation, per sources, as he and the 76ers look for solutions for his troublesome left knee. But, if the 76ers do manage to hang on to their pick, the combination of Maxey, promising rookie Jared McCain, the upcoming lottery pick and Quentin Grimes, who will be a restricted free agent but has impressed since coming over in a trade last month, at least gives Philadelphia some young talent to begin buttressing its roster.\n\nStill, any sort of a rebound next season will begin not only with Embiid but also George, whose availability moving forward is expected to be announced soon after the 34-year-old wing missed the past few games with a groin injury.\n\nBPI draft odds\n\nNo. 1 pick: 13.8%\n\nTop 3 pick: 39.3%\n\nTop 5 pick: 71.3%\n\nBontemps: Charlotte has earned a lot of credit around the league for the way it has handled the opening phases of its rebuild under owners Rick Schnall and Gabe Plotkin. The duo has invested heavily in the team, including working on a new practice facility and hiring a coaching staff led by Charles Lee and a front office led by Jeff Peterson that has executed a series of smart trades to build out the Hornets' asset base. \"They're checking the boxes on the things they need to do,\" a scout said.\n\nWindhorst: The Hornets showed their hand at the trade deadline when they surprisingly agreed to a trade to send franchise center Mark Williams to the Los Angeles Lakers. The deal was later rescinded and, when he has been healthy enough to be in the lineup, Williams has put up good numbers including a series of 20-point/10-rebound games. But that the Hornets were willing to trade him a few months before he was eligible to sign a contract extension sent a message around the league.\n\n\"There may not be too many players on their roster they're not willing to discuss in deals this summer,\" one executive said. \"It may start with [2023 No. 2 pick] Brandon Miller and not go too far after that.\"\n\nBontemps: That raises the obvious question: What about LaMelo Ball? Sources said the Hornets have no interest in moving on from their star guard. But setting aside the questions about Williams moving forward after the rescinded trade, the Hornets have Miller, their upcoming lottery pick and this year's lottery selection, Tidjane Salaun, all as building blocks moving forward.\n\nBall, meanwhile, is already on his second contract. That alone makes it an interesting situation to monitor moving forward. \"LaMelo is the question there,\" the scout said.\n\nWindhorst: This will be the ninth consecutive season Charlotte misses the playoffs, and big deals given to Ball ($204 million) and Miles Bridges ($75 million) haven't changed the team's outlook, nor has acquiring a host of veterans with years left on their contracts like Grant Williams, Josh Green and Jusuf Nurkic.\n\n\"Jeff Peterson and his group have made a couple of shrewd deals to pick up assets,\" another scout said. \"They may be thinking of doing a larger surgery to the roster.\"\n\nBPI draft odds\n\nNo. 1 pick: 14%\n\nTop 3 pick: 39.9%\n\nTop 5 pick: 89.0%\n\nWindhorst: The Wizards have a historically bad minus-11.9 net rating this season, a statistical representation of a team that hasn't just routinely lost while in the midst of a long-term rebuild but one that has been routinely dominated. The Wizards' front office clearly did not build a team meant to seriously contend for the playoffs, but they've been out of even competing for a play-in spot by Christmas the past two seasons. Even if they hit lottery luck for a second consecutive year and land a top-four pick, this is a team that is very likely headed for the lottery again next season.\n\nBut the lopsided losing is something they've been working on. At the trade deadline, they dealt for respected veteran players Khris Middleton and Marcus Smart. After having two separate 15-game losing streaks and winning just five games before Jan. 1 with a wretched minus-16.9 net rating, the Wizards have won eight games since the trades to improve their net rating to minus-6.0. Baby steps.\n\nBontemps: Those baby steps have been noticed around the league. Multiple executives praised the Wizards for bringing in Middleton -- getting another young flier in AJ Johnson as part of the deal -- to provide some veteran stability for an extremely young team.\n\n\"I like what they are doing,\" an executive said. \"They're doing things the right way.\"\n\nAs with so many of these teams, much of their future will come down to what happens this spring, and whether Washington winds up with Flagg or another elite prospect around whom to anchor its rebuild. At some point, though, there must be steps forward from a team that won 15 games last season and might not win more than that this season.\n\nUtah Jazz (15-51)\n\nBPI draft odds\n\nNo. 1 pick: 13.9%\n\nTop 3 pick: 39.8%\n\nTop 5 pick: 81.5%\n\nBontemps: The past two seasons saw the Jazz operate from the same playbook: be competitive for the first 45 or 50 games, and then plummet down the standings over the final weeks of the regular season. That has resulted in the Jazz landing a pair of draft picks in the middle of the lottery and, so far, striking out on adding the long-term difference maker they need.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Jazz took a different approach this season, fully committing to being in the Cooper Flagg sweepstakes from the beginning -- which played a part in them getting fined this week for violating the PPP. (It's also possible that Utah won't be the last team fined for it, either.)\n\nBreaking News from Shams Charania Download the ESPN app and enable Shams Charania's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first.

For more information, click here.\n\nWindhorst: The Jazz are going to meet their goal of having one of the three bottom spots that will get them a 14% chance to win the lottery in May. But even three years into a rebuild that was kicked off with the trades of Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert in 2022, the Jazz haven't built a clear foundation of core players. Even if they strike gold in the draft, they still may be a way off from playoff contention.\n\nWhen Markkanen waited to sign his four-year, $220 million contract extension last August, he waited until rules prevented him from being traded this season. But his commitment to the franchise came with an understanding, league sources said, that the Jazz would have a timely turn toward competing. For the moment, that path isn't clear -- and Markkanen can be traded after the season.\n\nBPI draft odds\n\nNo. 1 pick: 13.1%\n\nTop 3 pick: 37.5%\n\nTop 5 pick: 59.1%\n\nWindhorst: The Pelicans have been decimated by injuries yet again and have an expensive team that has routinely unachieved. After missing 24 games this season after a third consecutive year with a significant hamstring injury, Zion Williamson has been healthy for the past two months and has shown improved playmaking and conditioning. But the Pelicans are still losing, and their payroll will still be high next season with Trey Murphy III's salary increasing by $20 million and an uncertain recovery timetable for Dejounte Murray, who would've been an interesting trade candidate before he tore his Achilles in January.\n\n\"The question about the Pelicans is whether they would consider trading Zion,\" a rival general manager said. \"It hasn't really been an option over the last couple of years because he's been injured, and his value hasn't been high enough. Even now, I don't think they could get great value. So they will probably see if he can carry this play over into next year.\"",

            "content": "While the whole market was looking at the appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as Intel chief executive, there was another major development at the company this week: The first 18A (1.8nm-class) wafers are running around Intel's Arizona fab. Intel's Fab 52 and Fab 62 in Arizona are high-volume production facilities, so running 18A fabs there is a major milestone for the company.\n\nThe most important $INTC announcement today wasn't the CEO announcement.It was 18A wafers coming off the line at their new fab in Arizona. This fab is only meant to start output mid 25 so it looks like it is ahead of schedule.Congratulations to all the @Intel engineers! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/730Otd4B3pMarch 13, 2025\n\n\"Exciting Milestone for Intel 18A,\" wrote Pankaj Marria, an engineering manager at Intel, in a LinkedIn post that was eventually hidden but captured by @Mojo_flyin on X. \"Proud to be part of the Eagle Team, leading the way in bringing Intel 18A technology to life! Our team was at the forefront of running the initial lots right here in Arizona, marking a key step in advancing cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing.\"\n\nUp until recently, Intel processed wafers on its 18A production technology at its site near Hillsboro, Oregon, where new manufacturing processes are developed. While the company can volume produce chips in Oregon as well, porting this new fabrication process to a brand-new fab in Arizona is indeed a milestone for the company.\n\nFor now, the company is running test wafers to ensure that the fabrication process transfer is a success, but eventually the fab will start running actual chips for commercial products.\n\nIntel is set to mass produce compute chiplets for its upcoming codenamed Panther Lake processors on 18A technology later this year. Eventually, Intel's 18A production node will be used to make Intel's Xeon 7 codenamed Clearwater Forest processor for datacenters.\n\nIntel pins a lot of hope on the upcoming 18A fabrication process. The manufacturing technology relies on gate-all-around RibbonFET transistors that promise to increase performance and cut down power consumption.\n\nIt also features backside power delivery, which is meant to ensure steady power delivery to power-hungry processors and increase transistor density by decoupling signal and power wires within a chip.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Tan replaces Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted last year after the board lost confidence in his turnaround efforts, which included cutting 15,000 jobs and delaying chipmaking projects.\n\nTan, previously head of Cadence Design Systems, pledged to restore Intel\u2019s reputation by taking calculated risks to outmanoeuvre competitors.\n\nHe intends to continue the company\u2019s plan to manufacture chips for other firms, directly challenging TSMC. However, analysts remain cautious, questioning whether Intel will split its foundry and chip design businesses or prove its ability to deliver cutting-edge technology.\n\nIntel also faces a growing battle in AI, where Nvidia dominates the data centre chip market. Analysts warn that without a compelling AI strategy, Intel could struggle to regain investor confidence.\n\nTan, however, remains optimistic, vowing to transform Intel into a world-class chipmaker while ensuring customer satisfaction.\n\nFor more information on these topics, visit diplomacy.edu.",

            "content": "Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, stressed the importance of focusing on generative artificial intelligence and emerging software technologies nearly three years back, as he accepted the Semiconductor Industry Association's (SIA) Robert N. Noyce Award in November 2022. Lip-Bu's appointment to the top role at Intel was announced by the firm earlier this week after a three-month vacuum following the departure of its former CEO, Patrick Gelsinger. In his first message to workers after his appointment, Lip-Bu also highlighted the need for teamwork and customer satisfaction. His comments appeared to draw from his approach at software firm Cadence, whose turnaround has made the CEO into one of the most revered figures in the industry.\n\nIntel CEO Had Stressed Teamwork & Leapfrogging At SIA Speech Two Years Back\n\nIn his remarks at his SIA acceptance speech in 2022, Lip-Bu shared that he had found the time to \"look at the bigger picture.\" He proceeded to highlight areas that he was passionate about. These included \"advanced packaging,\" \"new materials,\" the infrastructure required to store \"massive data\" and \"Software 2.0.\" Lip-Bu outlined that Software 2.0 defines the hardware that it needs and that it was a \"goldmine\" that he was aggressively investing into.\n\nAlong with Software 2.0, the now Intel CEO also shared that the \"second area that I'm excited about is AI machine learning, foundation models, and generative AI content and application.\" These areas are \"something that I'm very passionate [about],\" he shared.\n\nAt the time Lip-Bu outlined the importance of generative artificial intelligence, OpenAI had yet to publicly release its ChatGPT chatbot. ChatGPT's public release sparked an AI wave on Wall Street which sent NVIDIA's shares soaring as its GPUs were used to train ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, while NVIDIA benefited from the surging sentiment for AI, Intel faltered in the background. The firm's AI products were unable to compete with NVIDIA's AI GPUs, which, despite the recent concerns about lower AI spending, are nevertheless the gold standard for AI computing.\n\nThe rest of Lip-Bu's speech mirrored his letter to Intel employees after he took over. He outlined in 2022 that he admired Henry David Thoreau's contrarian philosophy that drove his decisions to invest in the semiconductor industry when he set up his venture capital firm. Lip-Bu revealed that after he took over at Cadence, he received 300 emails and had to respond to each of them.\n\nAt Cadence, the situation was \"particularly challenging\" at the beginning, Lip-Bu shared. At Cadence, his team focused on \"innovation, culture, and customers,\" he remarked. According to him, innovation is key to function in the technology industry, as leapfrog innovation is the leading driver of product performance.\n\nHis letter to Intel employees also stressed on teamwork, leapfrogging and customer satisfaction. Inte's shares have gained nearly 15% since his appointment, despite Lip-Bu asserting that he will make Intel a world class foundry. His success in turning around Cadence and driving investment in the chip industry have injected optimism into the shares. Over the year, Intel's stock is down by 44% but has marked 17% in year-to-date gains.",

            "content": "Wall Street responded positively to the appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as Intel's (INTC) new chief executive. But Intel stock is likely to face a rocky road ahead as Tan looks to turn around the struggling chipmaker.\n\nIntel announced late Wednesday that its board had appointed Tan as CEO after a three-month search following the sudden retirement of previous CEO Pat Gelsinger. Tan previously served as chief executive of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS). He will join the company effective March 18.\n\nTan also will rejoin Intel's board of directors after stepping down last August.\n\nInterim co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus will remain with the company. Zinsner will continue to serve as executive vice president and chief financial officer, and Johnston Holthaus will remain CEO of Intel Products.\n\nOn the stock market today, Intel stock jumped 14.6% to close at 23.70. However, in the past year through Wednesday's close, Intel stock had fallen 53%.\n\nThe appointment of Tan as CEO is a \"good start\" but Intel has significant challenges, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a client note.\n\nThose challenges include delays in its server chip product line, a very competitive PC chip market, lack of a compelling AI chip offering, and over $10 billion in losses in its foundry business over the past 12 months. There is \"no quick fix\" for those issues, he said.\n\nMoore rates Intel stock as equal weight, or neutral, with a price target of 25.\n\nInvestment bank Stifel said the new CEO is \"a longer-term positive,\" but Intel faces a lengthy period of transition as it adapts to the now AI-centric market. Stifel rates Intel stock as hold.\n\nIntel's Foundry Operations In Focus\n\nOn Wednesday, Intel stock advanced 4.6% to close at 20.68 following a news report that a consortium of companies has suggested taking over its chip-manufacturing operations.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) has pitched fabless chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA) the idea of taking stakes in a joint venture to operate Intel's chip-fabrication operations, Reuters reported.\n\nTan's appointment seems to calm speculation that Intel might split its product and manufacturing businesses, TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said in a report.\n\nIn a message to Intel employees, Tan acknowledged that it's been \"a tough few years\" for the company. But he said he is prepared to remake the company for future success.\n\n\"Together, we will work hard to restore Intel's position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before,\" Tan said.\n\n\"In areas where we have momentum, we need to double down and extend our advantage,\" he said. \"In areas where we are behind the competition, we need to take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog. And in areas where our progress has been slower than expected, we need to find new ways to pick up the pace.\"\n\nIntel Stock Upgraded To Neutral\n\nTD Cowen's Buchalter said Tan is a \"very strong choice\" to lead Intel. But changes at Intel will take some time to bear fruit, he said.\n\n\"A true turnaround is still very likely measured in years rather than quarters,\" Buchalter said in a report. He rates Intel stock as hold with a price target of 20.\n\nTan has good insight into Intel's problems after having served previously on the company's board, Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson said in client note.\n\n\"He should be very familiar with Intel's current situation, allowing him to hit the ground running with a clear direction,\" Bryson said.\n\nAlso, Tan is \"arguably one of the most connected men in tech given his past role with Cadence as well as his venture activities,\" Bryson said. He rates Intel stock as neutral with a price target of 20.\n\nBofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya upgraded Intel stock to neutral from underperform on the CEO news. He also raised his price target to 25 from 19.\n\n\"We believe Intel has a greater opportunity to restructure/turn things around under his leadership, with Intel's strong incumbency/brand position in enterprise PC/server CPUs (central processing units) increasing the potential for success,\" Arya said in a client note.\n\nFollow Patrick Seitz on X, formerly Twitter, at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor stocks.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nAdobe Stock Falls After Software Firm Gives Mixed Outlook\n\nNvidia Stock Attempts Rebound As Bulls Pound The Table\n\nHow To Know It's Time To Sell Your Favorite Stock\n\nWhen To Sell Growth Stocks: This Could Be Your No. 1 Rule\n\nJoin IBD Live For Stock Ideas Each Morning Before The Open",

When you build a new semiconductor manufacturing facility, you don't get revenue instantly, and you don't get it up to full capacity instantly either.\"\n\nIn a letter to employees, Tan laid out intentions to regain momentum at the company, including a redoubled push to expand Intel's foundry business.\n\n\"Together, we will work hard to restore Intel\u2019s position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before,\" said Tan. \"That\u2019s what this moment demands of us as we remake Intel for the future.\"\n\nIntel's new leadership will be working to gain the trust of employees and shareholders, said Alvin Nguyen, senior analyst at Forrester, in a Thursday email.\n\n\"Their immediate priorities should be shoring up confidence in Intel among investors and employees, as well as creating positive momentum with both Products and Foundry businesses,\" said Nguyen.\n\nFor CIOs, the task ahead is to track upcoming Intel product releases, closely watching whether Intel Xeon processors can perform against AMD data center processors, or if Intel GPUs \"can establish a foothold against Nvidia in the AI market,\" Nguyen said.\n\nIntel's push toward the AI PC market, a strategy kicked off under Gelsinger's tenure, is expected to continue, according to Paquet.\n\n\"What they need to do a better job of is identifying the workloads that are going to be on the PC from an AI perspective and what the right configuration is,\" Paquet said. \"They have the pieces here to do this.\"",

            "content": "Analysts are mostly keen on the new Intel CEO\n\nAnalyst Jack Gold isn't sure about Trump's bid to repeal the CHIPs act and whether Congress will allow that\n\nAnd how will all this affect the chip startups?\n\nIt\u2019s been a busy week in the 5G server chip market and the silicon market overall.\n\nIntel has appointed its new CEO \u2013 former board member and semiconductor veteran Lip-Bu Tan \u2013 to be the architect of its turnaround.\n\n\u201cThis is welcome news for Intel Corporation, as it appoints an industry veteran that has intrinsic understanding of the semiconductor industry, both from a product design aspect as well as the needs of enabling chip manufacturing \u2013 an area that Intel Foundry needs help in making their tools more user friendly and accessible for potential customers,\u201d said Jack Gold, founder of J.Gold Associates.\n\nLike many other analysts, Gold had feared that Intel would hire a financial or non-chip CEO. That would have sent a message about how the board wanted to split Intel up, but Gold noted that \u201cTan had a great run at Cadence,\u201d where he was CEO from 2009 to 2021 and served on its board for 19 years.\n\n\u201cI think this also means that the board wants to keep Intel whole,\u201d Gold said.\n\nIntel\u2019s shares are rising on the news of Tan\u2019s appointment, up 15.64% at $23.91 on Thursday.\n\nTrump and the CHIPs act\n\nIntel \u2013 as well as many other smaller American semiconductor companies \u2013 could be affected by President Trump\u2019s call for Congress to end Biden\u2019s CHIPs act. Trump said on March 4 that he wanted to repeal the CHIPs act, which was set into law in August 2022 to bring back more microchip manufacturing to the United States.\n\n\u201cI think that Congress will push back if he does try to cancel it, since it\u2019s a funded program that Congress established. There are many states involved getting significant funding from the CHIPS Act, including red states, and the economic implications are far-reaching for Ohio, NY, AZ, NM, etc.,\u201d Gold said in an email to Fierce. \u201cAnd the CHIPS Act didn\u2019t just fund fabs \u2013 it also had a lot of money in there for training new workers that won\u2019t get spent if it goes away, and even a significant chunk for 5G/6G research to keep the US ahead in the telco race.\u201d\n\nHe noted that much will depend on what happens with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) distribution of CHIPs funds. Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has already terminated more than 70 employees from the agency on March 3.\n\n\u201cIf NIST gets [further] decimated, then the funding really goes into a black hole,\u201d Gold said.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just the fabs and the chip companies affected. If the funding doesn\u2019t go through, it\u2019s likely a lot of potential jobs won\u2019t go through either, which will create economic hardships for communities expecting them (like around the Intel Fab in OH),\u201d Gold added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a big question mark,\u201d he commented.\n\nStartups and CHIPs\n\nTalking to Fierce on February 25, new CEO of portable Open RAN 5G Radio Unit (RU) startup Eridan \u2013 Omid Tahernia \u2013 said that Eridan \u201cdoesn\u2019t see an issue\u201d with the CHIPs act funding, from which the startup has received a $36.8 million grant.\n\n\u201cThe way the grant works is when we occur expenses we submit those,\u201d Tahernia said, before Trump called for the end of the act. Of course, Eridan is backed by investors like Capricorn as well.\n\nEridan is planning to sell its 5G radios to private network systems integrators. The startup is ramping up production of its RU right now.\n\nFierce will be watching to see what happens to the CHIPs act after Trump and DOGE get through with it. We\u2019ll see if the Republican Congress deigns to take apart a bipartisan bill.",

As of Wednesday\u2019s closing bell, the company\u2019s shares had fallen more than 54%, signaling investors\u2019 deep concern about the company\u2019s future.\n\nTan spent more than a decade as CEO of technology design firm Cadence Design Systems, where he led a \u201creinvention of the company,\u201d according to Intel. He is also a founding managing partner of Walden Catalyst Ventures, which invests in semiconductor, AI, cloud and other advanced technologies.\n\n\u201cLip-Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,\u201d Intel\u2019s interim executive chair Frank Yeary said in a statement. Yeary will revert to being the board\u2019s independent chair when Tan becomes CEO on March 18.\n\nTan will have a massive task at hand when he takes over Intel, which largely missed out on both the mobile computing and AI technology revolutions \u2014 ceding dominance to rivals such as Qualcomm and Nvidia. Rumors of a takeover have circulated in recent months as Intel\u2019s future looked uncertain.\n\nAnd he\u2019ll be on the hook to prove he can be a more adept CEO than Gelsinger, the company veteran who was thought of as a sort of prodigal son who would fix the company when he took over the top job in 2021, but failed to do so.\n\nIn August, the company said it would lay off 15% of its staff as part of an effort to slash $10 billion in costs. And in November, Intel lost its spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to Nvidia, marking the end of a 25-year run that began when it was among the first two technology firms to be included in the blue-chip index.\n\nThe effort to revitalize Intel, long a pillar of the American tech industry, comes as President Donald Trump, like former President Joe Biden before him, has sought to encourage investment in US chipmaking. Advanced semiconductor manufacturing is seen as a matter important to national security because chips power countless tech products, from iPhones and AI systems to weapons and medical devices. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company announced earlier this month that it will invest at least $100 billion to grow its US operations.",

Part of the message: He will keep working to make Intel a top foundry \u2014 a business that produces chips for outside clients. That endeavor has been costly for Intel so far, and contributed to the ouster of prior CEO Pat Gelsinger.\n\n\u201cWe will work hard to restore Intel\u2019s position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before,\u201d he said in the letter, which was published on Intel\u2019s website. \u201cThat\u2019s what this moment demands of us as we remake Intel for the future.\u201d\n\nInvestors applauded the hiring of Tan, 65, despite the lack of a clear signal that he\u2019ll take Intel in a new direction. The shares gained more than 10% in late trading Wednesday after the announcement.\n\nThe stock had rallied last month on anticipation that the company would be broken up \u2014 with Intel potentially separating the foundry business from its chip design group.\n\nPlowing ahead with the foundry strategy means taking on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in a market that the Asian company pioneered. TSMC is dominant in the field, churning out chips for clients such as Nvidia Corp., Apple Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.\n\nIntel spent most of its history just producing chips for itself, rather than outside customers. Its decades of dominance over the industry were built on the tight coupling of cutting-edge manufacturing and its own products, designed in-house. But the power of that combination has waned, and TSMC is able to produce more advanced components.\n\nIt\u2019s still an open question whether Tan might split up the foundry and chip-design businesses, Srini Pajjuri, an analyst at Raymond James, said in a note to clients. Barring that move, Intel will have to demonstrate that it can produce better products.\n\nMembers of the Trump administration also have floated the idea of TSMC backing a spinoff of Intel\u2019s factory business. But TSMC\u2019s recent plan to invest $100 billion in its own factories suggests that it\u2019s not aiming to pursue that idea.",

Intel has seen its fair share of ups and downs in the past few years \u2014 to put it mildly.\n\nWhen Gelsinger took the helm in February 2021, Intel was already struggling and was falling far behind its peers in the semiconductor race. At the time, the company was likely still reeling from missing out on the smartphone revolution in addition to missteps when it came to chip fabrication.\n\nIt was also an interesting time for the semiconductor industry at large. The sector had seen a lot of recent consolidation in late 2020, including AMD acquiring Xilink for $35 billion and Analog buying Maxim for $21 billion, among others.\n\nSo how was Gelsinger\u2019s most recent tenure at Intel? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nGelsinger got right to work when he started. He announced a modernization plan for the company, dubbed IDM, or integrated device manufacturing. The first part of the goal was a $20 billion investment to build two new chip manufacturing facilities in Arizona, with plans to boost chip production in the U.S. and beyond.\n\nIn 2022, the company announced the second part of this IDM plan, which involved a three-pronged approach to chip manufacturing: Intel\u2019s fabs, third-party global manufacturers, and building out the company\u2019s foundry services. As part of this plan, the company announced it would acquire Tower Semiconductor for $5.4 billion to help build out Intel\u2019s custom foundry services.\n\nThat deal fell through, however, after facing regulatory hurdles. It was canceled in the summer of 2023. At the time, TechCrunch reported that the merger not going through would have a serious impact on the company\u2019s modernization plans. In September 2024, Intel took steps to transition its chip foundry division, Intel Foundry, to an independent subsidiary.\n\nThe time leading up to Gelsinger\u2019s retirement was particularly tumultuous for Intel. The company\u2019s stock price plummeted about 50% from the beginning of 2024 to Gelsinger\u2019s departure in December. Intel announced plans to lay off 15% of its workforce, around 15,000 people, in August after dismal second-quarter results. At that time, Gelsinger said the company had struggled to capitalize on the AI boom in the same way its rivals had, and that despite falling behind, Intel had overgrown headcount.\n\nIn the time since Gelsinger\u2019s departure, the company has delayed the opening of its Ohio chip factory \u2014 again \u2014 and decided not to bring its Falcon Shores AI chips to market.",

            "content": "Key Takeaways Intel shares soared 10% in extended trading Wednesday after the company named former board member and chip industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO.\n\nSince gapping sharply lower in early August last year, the stock has remained mostly rangebound, potentially carving out a market bottom.\n\nInvestors should watch crucial overhead areas on Intel's chart around $22, $26, and $30, while also monitoring a major support level near $19.\n\nIntel (INTC) shares soared in extended trading Wednesday after the company named former board member and chip industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO.\n\nTan, who is the former CEO of chip software company Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), will succeed interim Co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, who have shared the position since Pat Gelsinger retired in December. Tan will assume the roll next Tuesday.\n\nThe development follows a report earlier Wednesday that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) has approached Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO) about forming a joint venture to own and run Intel's foundry division \u2014 a unit that manufactures chips for third party customers.\n\nIntel shares have lost more than half their value over the past 12 months, weighed down by the company\u2019s inability to capture a greater share of the lucrative AI chip market and months of restructuring and deal rumors. The stock jumped 10% to $22.84 in the after-hours session Wednesday following news of the CEO appointment.\n\nBelow, we break down the technicals on Intel\u2019s chart and identify crucial price levels that investors may be watching.\n\nPotential Rangebound Bottom\n\nSince gapping sharply lower in early August last year, Intel shares have remained mostly rangebound, potentially carving out a market bottom.\n\nMore recently, the stock staged a short-lived rally to the closely followed 200-day moving average (MA) before retracing towards its trading floor of the past seven months.\n\nHowever, the shares moved higher in Wednesday\u2019s regular trading session and look set for further gains on Thursday.\n\nLet\u2019s locate three crucial overhead areas to watch on Intel\u2019s chart amid the potential for a new trend higher and also identify a major support level worth monitoring if the stock retraces to multi-month lows.\n\nCrucial Overhead Areas to Watch\n\nThe first overhead area to watch sits around $22. While the stock is currently projected to open above this price on Thursday, it\u2019s worth looking if bulls can hold this level into tomorrow\u2019s close, given its proximity to a horizontal line that links a range of comparable trading action on the chart from August last year to March this year.\n\nA successful close above this level could see the shares rally to the $26 area. Investors who have bought recent lows may look to lock in profits near the prominent November and March peaks.\n\nBuying above this region could propel a move to around $30. This area would likely provide resistance near the psychological round number and the low of a prior trading range on the chart that preceded the early-August gap lower.\n\nMajor Support Level Worth Monitoring\n\nFurther selling in Intel shares could see the price revisit multi-month lows around $19. Bargain hunters may seek to scoop up shares in this location near a trendline that connects multiple troughs in the stock between August and February.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

The stock jumped 12% in extended trading.\n\nTan was previously CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software used by all the major chip designers, including Intel. He was an Intel board member but departed last year, citing other commitments.\n\nTan replaces interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and MJ Holthaus, who took over in December when former Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger was ousted. Tan is also rejoining Intel's board.\n\nThe appointment closes a chaotic chapter in Intel's history, as investors pressured the semiconductor company to cut costs and spin off businesses due to declining sales and an inability to crack the booming artificial intelligence market.\n\n\"In areas where we have momentum, we need to double down and extend our advantage,\" Tan said in statement on Intel's website. \"In areas where we are behind the competition, we need to take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog. And in areas where our progress has been slower than expected, we need to find ways to pick up the pace.\"\n\nTan becomes the fourth permanent CEO at Intel in seven years. Following Brian Krzanich's resignation in 2018, after the revelations of an inappropriate relationship with an employee, Bob Swan took the helm in Jan. 2019. He departed two years later after Intel suffered numerous blows from competitors and chip delays. Swan was succeeded by Gelsinger in 2021.\n\nGelsinger took over with a bold plan to transform Intel's business to manufacture chips for other companies in addition to its own, becoming a foundry. But Intel's overall products revenue continued to decline, and investors fretted over the significant capital expenditures needed for such massive chip production, including constructing a $20 billion dollar factory complex in Ohio.",

Gelsinger worked at Intel for 30 years, from 1979 to 2009, before leaving and eventually returning in 2021 to take the CEO job.\n\nTan will take over as CEO on March 18th from interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle (MJ) Johnston Holthaus.

Zinsner and Holthaus took over the top spot at Intel after former CEO Pat Gelsinger suddenly left the company in December.\n\nTan, whose age was listed at 64 in March 2024 in a public filing, is no stranger to Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel. Tan served as CEO of chip design tool provider Cadence Systems from 2009 to 2021 and was a member of the board of Intel from 2022 to 2024. He currently serves on the boards of data infrastructure market-focused Credo Technology Group and Schneider Electric.\n\nHe is also a founding managing partner of Walden Catalyst Ventures and chairman of venture firm Walden International.\n\n[Related: Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger Retires Amid Financial Struggles, Comeback Plan]\n\nTan reportedly clashed with Gelsinger and other directors over his concerns about Intel\u2019s \u201cbloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging [AI] strategy,\u201d Reuters reported at the time. Tan stepped down from the Intel board in August 2024 and said his decision was based on \"demands on his time,\u201d according to a regulatory filing at the time.\n\n\u201cThis is a personal decision based on a need to reprioritize various commitments, and I remain supportive of the company and its important work,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nThe Intel board later considered Tan as one of its top candidates for the Intel CEO role, alongside Marvell Technology CEO Matt Murphy and other outsiders, Reuters reported in December. Both reports cited anonymous sources familiar with the discussions around the issues.\n\nDuring his time at Cadence Systems, Tan led the company to double its revenue and increased its share prices by over 3,200 percent.\n\nInvestors were happy about the appointment of Tan as Intel CEO, driving the company\u2019s share prices up more than 10 percent in after-hours trading to about $23 per share compared to the price of $19.78 at the close of the trading day. The stock is down more than 50 percent over the past 12 months.\n\nIntel declined to provide further comment on the announcement beyond its press release.\n\nInterim chairman Frank Yeary, in a prepared statement, called Tan an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO.\n\n\u201cThroughout his long and distinguished career, he has earned a reputation as an innovator who puts customers at the heart of everything he does, delivers differentiated solutions to win in the market and builds high-performance cultures to achieve success,\u201d Yeary said.\n\nWith the appointment of Tan as Intel\u2019s new CEO, Zinsner will continue his permanent role as executive vice president and chief financial officer, while Johnston Holthaus will continue as CEO of Intel Products.\n\nAt the same time, Yeary will revert to being the independent chair of Intel\u2019s board.\n\nDylan Martin and David Harris contributed to this story.",

European officials across the continent reacted to the decision with alarm and have begun multiple rounds of meetings on how they can sustain Ukraine\u2019s self-defense without U.S. assistance.\n\nAside from the ceasefire proposal, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said the U.S and Ukraine also discussed humanitarian concerns and what security guarantees Ukraine is seeking. To this point, Kyiv has sought an American military commitment to enforce any peace deal signed with Russia, which has broken past ceasefires and launched a full-scale invasion three years ago.\n\nThe Trump administration has been adamant that any security guarantees must come from Europe, part of an overall pivot away from U.S. military support for the continent. European countries have increased military spending in recent years but would still struggle to take on such an expansive role without American aid.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump told reporters last week that America would question whether countries in NATO spent enough on defense before coming to their aid, a core part of the alliance.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to pay your bills, we\u2019re not going to defend you,\u201d Trump said.\n\nNoah Robertson is the Pentagon reporter at Defense News.

            "content": "Kyiv and Washington have agreed to pitch a 30-day ceasefire to Russia, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday, adding that the United States will immediately resume delivering vital weapons and intelligence to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019ll have to go to Russia, and hopefully President [Vladimir] Putin will agree to it also,\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re going to meet with them later on today and tomorrow.\u201d\n\nSteve Witkoff, the U.S. envoy to the Middle East, was scheduled to head to Russia today for those talks.\n\nRubio and his Ukrainian counterparts met on Tuesday in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his own statement that the day\u2019s discussions began with Ukraine\u2019s key priorities: stopping Russia\u2019s missile and drone attacks, releasing prisoners of war, the return of Ukrainian children taken to Russia, and building confidence in the overall diplomatic process.\n\n\u201cThe American side understands our arguments and considers our proposals,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cThe U.S. side proposed taking an even bigger first step\u2014a 30-day full interim ceasefire, not only stopping missile, drone, and bomb attacks, not only in the Black Sea, but also along the entire front line. Ukraine is ready to accept this proposal.\u201d\n\nAt the Jeddah meeting, the Ukrainian delegation \u201creiterated that European partners shall be involved in the peace process,\u201d according to a joint statement from Ukraine and the United States\u2014an important point for the Ukrainians and a move that Russia has resisted.\n\nTuesday\u2019s deal gives the White House much of what it wanted. Ukraine is likely to concede territory to Russia, at least militarily, and enter a mineral deal with the United States.\n\n\u201cBoth countries\u2019 presidents agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine\u2019s critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine\u2019s economy and guarantee Ukraine\u2019s long-term prosperity and security,\u201d according to the joint statement.\n\nThe U.S. cutoff of intelligence put immense pressure on Ukraine to accede to White House demands. Reports from Lithuania-based independent Russian news outlet Meduza indicate the cutoff was already hurting Ukraine\u2019s tenuous hold on the Russian region of Kursk.\n\nOne former senior White House official told Defense One \u201can unconditional ceasefire is probably in Ukraine\u2019s best interest, if it holds.\u201d\n\nBut Zelenskyy was able to resist much of what Trump was demanding after the Oval Office showdown, securing a win of sorts. Trump pushed for Zelensky\u2019s ouster\u2014a long-time goal of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who in February referred to Zelenskyy as \u201cthe current head of the regime,\u201d and said he \u201cstands in the way\u201d of peace.\n\nInstead, Trump\u2019s efforts to strongarm Ukraine helped unite European partners in support of Zelenskyy and the beleaguered country. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer began to assemble a \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d across Europe, including the possibility of European troops to deter Russia from attempting to expand its territorial hold following a peace deal. French President Emmanuel Macron likewise expressed a willingness to extend France\u2019s nuclear-deterrence umbrella to other European nations to bolster the continent\u2019s security independence from Washington.\n\nThe intelligence cutoff also underscored the importance of intelligence sources outside of Washington. \u201cThe U.S. halt to military aid and intelligence sharing would have a 'significant operational impact' on Ukraine. But France's own intelligence provided to Kyiv was not reliant on Washington,\u201d French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu said last week.\n\nThe idea of the United States pushing for the removal of a democratically elected head of state alarmed even Trump allies, including Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma.\n\nPutin has also pushed for the demilitarization of Ukraine and said he would never accept the presence of European troops on Ukraine\u2019s soil. European officials told Bloomberg on Tuesday that they don\u2019t expect Russia\u2019s terms to be met.\n\nBut it will depend on Russia\u2019s demands to Witkoff, the former senior White House official said: \u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible then that Trump tells Zelenskyy that he should meet those demands if wants the ceasefire to hold.\u201d",

            "content": "By Fanny Potkin, Milana Vinn and Wen-Yee Lee\n\nSINGAPORE/NEW YORK/TAIPEI (Reuters) -TSMC has pitched U.S. chip designers Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom about taking stakes in a joint venture that would operate Intel's factories, according to four sources familiar with the matter.\n\nUnder the proposal, the Taiwanese chipmaking giant would run the operations of Intel's foundry division, which makes chips adapted for the needs of customers, but it would not own more than 50%, the sources said. Qualcomm has also been pitched by TSMC, according to one of the sources and a separate source.\n\nThe talks, which are at an early stage, come after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration requested TSMC, the world's leading contract chipmaker, assist in turning around the troubled U.S. industrial icon, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.\n\nThe details of the plan for TSMC to take no more than a 50% stake and its overtures to potential partners are being reported for the first time.\n\nAny final deal - the value of which is unclear - would need approval from the Trump administration, which does not want Intel or its foundry division to be fully foreign-owned, the sources said.\n\nIntel, TSMC, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm declined to comment. The White House and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt stake is the future of the U.S. chipmaking giant, whose shares have lost more than half of their value in the last year.\n\nIntel reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986, driven by large impairments. The foundry division's property and plant equipment had a book value of $108 billion as of December 31, according to a company filing.\n\nIntel stock rose 6% in early U.S. trading on Wednesday, while Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm were up between 1.18% and 6.64%. TSMC closed about 1.8% higher in Taiwan.\n\nTrump is keen to revive Intel's fortunes, as he seeks to boost American advanced manufacturing, three of the sources said.\n\nThe sources said TSMC's joint venture pitch was made to potential backers before the Taiwanese chipmaker announced with Trump on March 3 that the company planned to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that involves building five additional chip facilities there in coming years.\n\nTalks about the joint venture over Intel's foundry division have since continued, the three sources said, with TSMC looking to have more than one chip designer as a partner.\n\nMultiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division.",

Oh, sure, there have been some breaths of this idea, as we look at a potential recession ahead. But Citi analysts are starting to wonder if the market can absorb much more new chip. Investors proved a bit skeptical, and sent Intel shares slipping fractionally in Tuesday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nThe idea from Christopher Danely, Citi analyst who has four stars on TipRanks, is that the chip market is basically somewhat full right now. The second half of 2024 saw chip sales grow at a double-digit pace. However, PC unit sales for that same time frame grew in the single-digit range, and merely mid-single-digits at that.\n\nThus, Danely suggests, it is possible that the chip market is building up too much inventory with too few places to put it. But this is still an early-stage concern, reports note, as Danely is keeping the Neutral rating on Intel stock. Meanwhile, PC unit shipments will still go up, about 4% in 2025. But if chip production starts to outpace PC unit sales by too wide a margin, that could result in a serious supply crunch.\n\nNo Silicon, Please, We\u2019re Chinese\n\nAnd then, in a new report that has the potential to fundamentally destabilize several different markets as we know them, a chip created at Peking University emerged. It is a 2D transistor chip made entirely without silicon. This chip, which is reportedly made out of bismuth, is also reportedly 40% faster than the newest three-nanometer silicon out of Intel, and also uses 10% less energy.\n\nThat is quite the success, if true, but then it is not hard to remember DeepSeek AI here. Remember DeepSeek AI? Which was supposed to be an utter powerhouse of an AI developed on a shoestring budget, before you discovered it was a lot less than it was cracked up to be, especially if you asked it about why a guy was standing in front of a tank in 1989.\n\nIs Intel a Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock based on one Buy, 25 Holds and five Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 55.75% loss in its share price over the past year, the average INTC price target of $22.69 per share implies 14.19% upside potential.\n\nSee more INTC analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

We\u2019re too busy doing AI and VMware at this point,\u2019 Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said on the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan said the nearly $60 billion tech giant is not currently interested in any mergers and acquisitions amid reports Broadcom was eyeing the purchase of Intel\u2019s chip design business.\n\nWhen asked during Broadcom\u2019s first fiscal quarter financial earnings report last week if it was looking at any M&A, Tan said the company is \u201ctoo busy\u201d investing in AI and still working through its blockbuster $69 billion acquisition of VMware that closed about 16 months ago.\n\n\u201cM&A? No, I\u2019m too busy. We\u2019re too busy doing AI and VMware at this point,\u201d said Tan. \u201cWe\u2019re not thinking of it at this point.\u201d\n\n[Related: Broadcom\u2019s CEO On $4B AI Sales, Tariffs, VMware And \u2018Stepping Up\u2019 Cloud R&D]\n\nTan\u2019s comments came after reports surfaced last month that Broadcom was eyeing the purchase of Intel\u2019s chip design business.\n\nBroadcom reportedly was in discussion with advisers on making an acquisition bid specifically for Intel\u2019s large chip design business, which includes its Core and Xeon CPUs for PCs and servers. Reports said the deal would have depended on another company buying Intel\u2019s chip manufacturing business, Intel Foundry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a smart move by Broadcom to not pursue it right now,\u201d said one top executive from a Broadcom-VMware partner who declined to be identified. \u201cIt would be too much, too fast. \u2026 It\u2019s just not the right time. Maybe next year if things keep looking good and the purchase becomes more favorable to [U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration].\u201d\n\nThe executive said Broadcom has a history of acquiring companies, followed by slashing costs and portfolio consolidation with the ultimate goal of achieving better profitability.\n\n\u201cIntel sort of needs a Broadcom-like acquirer right now, but I don\u2019t think [Broadcom] has the time and integration energy. They need to focus on finishing moving VMware customers around and see where they all land,\u201d he said.\n\nIntel Woes\n\nIntel has been the source of acquisition rumors this year in light of growing financial challenges that prompted the semiconductor giant last August to announce a $10 billion cost-cutting plan that resulted in the company slashing more than 15,000 jobs.\n\nEven before acquisition rumors began to pop up, Intel had taken steps to separate its Intel Foundry chip manufacturing business from its Intel Products chip design business.\n\nFor Intel\u2019s most recent fourth-quarter 2024 earnings, the company reported $14.3 billion in sales, down 7 percent year over year.\n\n\u201cBroadcom would likely tear up the [Foundry] business somewhat and make changes to things like Intel\u2019s AI chips and things like networking,\u201d said the executive.\n\nIntel has already canceled plans for its next-generation AI chip, which had been code-named Falcon Shores.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think they\u2019re ready for another massive integration and cost-cutting project right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a partner, I\u2019m glad they\u2019re not overbooking themselves because they have a lot going on.\u201d\n\nVMware Momentum\n\nBroadcom generated $14.9 billion in total sales during its first fiscal quarter 2025, besting Wall Street\u2019s expectations of $14.62 billion. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company\u2019s $14.9 billion in revenue represents a 25 percent year-over-year increase.\n\nIn addition, Broadcom\u2019s net income increased by 315 percent to $5.5 billion in first-quarter 2025 compared with $1.3 billion year over year.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s infrastructure software division, which includes VMware software, reached $6.7 billion in revenue during the quarter, representing an increase of 47 percent year over year.\n\nTan said VMware\u2019s growth was due to two reasons.\n\n\u201cOne, we\u2019re converting from a footprint of largely perpetual license to one of full subscription. And as of today, we are over 60 percent done,\u201d Tan said. \u201cTwo, these perpetual licenses were only largely for compute virtualization, otherwise called vSphere.\u201d\n\nVMware vSphere is now part of the VMware Cloud Foundation packaged bundle offering.\n\nTan said Broadcom is \u201cupselling customers to a full-stack VCF\u201d that enables customers to virtualize their data center and \u201ccreate their own private cloud environment\u201d on-premises.\n\n\u201cAs of the end of Q1, approximately 70 percent of our largest 10,000 customers have adopted VCF,\u201d he said. \u201cAs these customers consume VCF, we still see a further opportunity for future growth.\u201d",

Those top speeds are 200 MHz and 250 MHz higher than for the Intel N100 Alder Lake-N processor that was available in earlier models.\n\nIn terms of real-world performance, I don\u2019t expect there to be much difference. If you already have a mini-laptop with an Intel N100 processor, there\u2019s probably no good reason to upgrade to this newer model. But Intel\u2019s Twin Lake chips could be a little faster in some situations, so given the choice between buying a laptop with an Intel N100 or N150 chip, I\u2019d probably choose the latter if that\u2019s the only difference.\n\nOther features include a 25.9 Wh battery and 12V/3A power adapter, stereo speakers, and a set of ports that includes:\n\n1 x USB 3.0 Type-A\n\n1 x USB 2.0 Type-A\n\n1 x USB Type-C\n\n1 x mini HDMI\n\n1 x 3.5mm audio\n\n1 x microSD card reader\n\nThe little laptop has a QWERTY keyboard that\u2019s just (barely) big enough for thumb typing, with a fingerprint sensor integrated into the power button and an optical touch sensor above the space bar (because there\u2019s not enough room for a touchpad).\n\nIt supports WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2, and the Piccolo 2-in-1 measures 200.6 x 130.6 x 17.9mm (7.9\u2033 x 5.14\u2033 x 0.7\u2033) and weighs 658 grams (1.45 pounds).\n\nvia ETA Prime\n\nSupport Liliputing Liliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links (if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on Amazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).

These points together added up to a world of hurt for Intel, and shares plunged over 4% in Monday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nIntel, as it turned out, made a lot of promises to the state of Ohio, based on which it received what reports noted was around $600 million in onshoring grants, among other things, so it could construct its plant in Licking County. This also would have meant quite a few jobs as well, because obviously, a factory needs people to run it and do whatever needs to be done therein.\n\nBut as we know, Intel has pushed back on those plans at least once, and now, what Intel promised Ohio would happen\u2014and for which it landed a lot of taxpayer money\u2014just did not come off. In fact, it has reached the point where the state of Ohio can consider a \u201cclawback,\u201d in which it simply takes its money back. There is also the issue of roughly $1.075 billion in tax credits and infrastructure grants to consider. There is about a year left until Intel needs to request an amendment to the original agreements, so it has some time before everything really starts to go wrong.\n\nAnd There Go the Customers\n\nBut that was not all for Intel; at the Mobile World Congress, ARM rolled out a new tool that may cost Intel some business with Ericsson (ERIC) and Samsung (SSNLF). Intel has enjoyed something of a monopoly over the RAN subsector, reports note, which created a condition called \u201cvendor lock-in.\u201d But ARM may have figured out a way to beat that, and open up new possibilities for businesses that were formerly stuck with Intel.\n\nARM figured out a way to make its material compatible with x86 chips, reports noted. ARM managed to build an abstraction layer using Google\u2019s (GOOGL) Highway programming tool, which meant a much easier time of connecting through abstraction layers to ultimately get systems to work. Best of all, it works with less extra processing power than you might think. With ARM\u2019s new tool, the abstraction layer needs an extra 2.8% processing power. Generally, anything less than 10% is considered doable.\n\nIs Intel a Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock based on one Buy, 25 Holds and five Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 55.24% loss in its share price over the past year, the average INTC price target of $22.69 per share implies 14.83% upside potential.\n\nSee more INTC analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

Intel is proud to call Ohio home, and we remain excited about our future here.\u201d\n\nAccording to reporting from The Columbus Dispatch, Intel has spent nearly $4 billion in Ohio since announcing plans to build the fabs in 2022.\n\nIntel spent $4 billion at 500 supplier companies just in Oregon in 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nThat\u2019s an average of $4 million per company.\n\nIntel had approximately 8,200 suppliers in more than 85 countries as of 2023, according to its 2023-24 Corporate Responsibility Report.\n\nIntel\u2019s diverse suppliers as of 2023 in 26 countries. Credit: Intel 2023-24 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\nThe semiconductor giant needs a variety of goods and services to produce chips and microprocessors \u2014 construction, manufacturing, marketing, software, travel services and product testing are all listed as examples in the corporate report.\n\nAn April 2021 third-party economic impact study released by Intel suggested each job at an Intel facility either directly or indirectly supported 13 jobs elsewhere.\n\nStats from three years of Intel\u2019s work in Ohio. Credit: Intel Corporation\n\nWhat does this mean for Knox County and central Ohio?\n\nOregon hosts four different Intel locations, while Ohio will have one. Oregon hosts Intel\u2019s main research and development facilities, while Ohio\u2019s fabs will mainly support chip manufacturing.\n\nStill, the Ohio fabs are expected to create 3,000 Intel jobs and support 7,000 jobs in building trades during the construction process.\n\nA January 2025 construction update video from Intel. Crews have worked more than 6.4 million hours performing work that includes installing underground pipes, pouring more than 200,000 cubic yards of concrete, completing sub-utility trenches and starting office buildings.\n\nEmily Smith, director of site development and community affairs for Intel Ohio One, noted the above map of counties that contain suppliers for Intel Ohio One campus is outdated \u2014 the Ohio One campus now has more than 350 suppliers in 48 counties. The map above shows 38 counties.\n\n\u201cBefore Intel announced plans to build in Ohio, we had about 150 suppliers in the state,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSince announcing the Ohio One project, we now have more than 350 suppliers.\n\n\u201cSome of our suppliers will be located very close to our campus due to the need for close proximity, but many of the suppliers won\u2019t need to be so close.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the opportunity Jeff Gottke sees for Knox County.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Knox County will see transistors and silicon wafer companies because those are expensive to build and I\u2019m guessing they have to be very close to the facility in New Albany,\u201d said the president of the Knox County Area Development Foundation.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very possible that we support HVAC parts, duct work or any machine parts that make the semiconductors.\u201d\n\nWhat does Tier 1, 2 and 3 Supplier mean? An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) designs and oversees the final product. An OEM is at the top of a supply chain pyramid. Tier 1 suppliers manufacture and supply components or systems directly to the OEM. Tier 2 suppliers provide materials to Tier 1 suppliers. They usually make specialized components. Tier 3 suppliers specialize in raw materials and basic components that they sell to Tier 2 suppliers. Source: Metrikflow\n\nGottke noted Knox County has limited shovel-ready sites for new companies, including Fredericktown Industrial Park and Heartland Commerce Park.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important for companies looking for new space is speed to market, so how quickly they can get up and running,\u201d Gottke said. \u201cThey\u2019d want either a spec building or shovel-ready site with utilities. To remain competitive in the manufacturing sphere, we need more shovel-ready sites.\u201d\n\nManufacturing business leaders and educators discuss in-demand jobs with then-Lt. Gov. Jon Husted at Goyal Industries May 10, 2024.\n\nOhio semiconductor suppliers also support biotechnology, other industries\n\nBarrett Thomas, senior director of economic development for the Richland Area Chamber, said site development and supply chain buildouts are a long process.\n\n\u201cWhen you put this in the context of Honda in Marysville, that supply chain took 30 years to build out,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think the semiconductor supply chain will move faster than the auto supply chain, but it still takes time to aggregate the land, infrastructure, and have it in place to present to a company when you\u2019re talking site development.\u201d\n\nThomas said he thinks Richland County could support Tier 3 suppliers, or potentially Tier 2.\n\n\u201cFor Intel in particular, I would say nothing\u2019s ready to go yet in our area, but the more pieces we have in place, the more opportunity we have there,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why site control is so important, either through public or public-private ownership. Speed, risk and money relates to every site decision when you\u2019re looking at land to build on as a company, so the more you have in place ready to go is how you win long-term.\u201d\n\nMatt Englehart, communications manager for JobsOhio, noted semiconductor suppliers usually support other industries beyond chip manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWhile central Ohio is well positioned for supply chain growth, there are more semiconductor suppliers outside of central Ohio than in it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is due in part to Ohio\u2019s rich history of manufacturing.\n\n\u201cMany semiconductor suppliers support other industries, such as biotechnology and healthcare, smart manufacturing, smart mobility, IoT (Internet of Things, logistics) and energy.\u201d\n\nSemiconductor chips require millions of transistors, as well as silicon wafers, metals and a lithographing and etching process.\n\nIntel is actively seeking Ohio suppliers, listing categories of logistics and transportation, human resources, factory metals, marketing, computing and prototype testing on its website.\n\nFro Sand to Silicon: The Making of a Microchip\n\n\u201cOhio\u2019s rich industrial history, combined with its forward-looking economic development efforts, positions it as a prime destination for a range of high-tech industries,\u201d said Intel Communications Manager Elly Akopyan.\n\n\u201cRegions like Knox County bring valuable assets that can support industries critical to the semiconductor ecosystem, from glass fabrication to advanced materials and precision manufacturing.\u201d\n\nSherwood, Oregon \u2014 which Knox Pages reporters visited in October 2024 \u2014 hosts an 80,000-square-foot DWFritz location that manufactures precision automation systems and a 45,000-square foot space for development firm Lam Research, a Fortune 500 company with a variety of microchip products.\n\nDWFritz operates in Sherwood Commerce Center. Lam Research in Sherwood, Oregon\n\nMost of the semiconductor and integrated circuit suppliers in Washington County, Oregon are located in Hillsboro closest to Intel\u2019s four campuses.\n\nLam Research is headquartered in California and DWFritz in Wilsonville, Oregon. Those companies opened Sherwood locations just in the past three years in the city\u2019s new TualatinSherwood Corporate Park.\n\nOlympus Controls recently opened a 70,000-square-foot facility in Sherwood, where it builds industrial robotics, motion control, CNC automation systems and more.\n\nAccording to the corporate responsibility report, about 45% of Intel\u2019s suppliers were located in North, Central and South Americas as of 2023. Asia and Pacific Islands suppliers made up about 30% of the supply chain.",

            "content": "SK Hynix will complete its $9 billion takeover of Intel\u2019s NAND memory business in the coming weeks, setting the seal on the stumbling US giant\u2019s exit from the flash business.\n\nThe news emerged as US president Donald Trump pontificated on the fate of Intel, declaring that its CEOs post Andy Grove (who vacated the role in 1998) had lost direction and allowed Taiwan to \u201csteal\u201d the chip business from the US.\n\nKorean outlets reported this weekend that SK Hynix was poised to hand over the last $2.24 billion of the $9 billion price tag set on the business in 2020. The deal includes the unit\u2019s Dalian China NAND business, which became part of SK Hynix. The SSD division became a separate subsidiary dubbed Solidigm.\n\nThe first phase of the sale saw SK Hynix take over the Dalian factory and the SSD operation, but not all the relevant intellectual property. The conclusion of the deal was slated for some time after March 2025.\n\nWith the final part of the payment made, SK Hynix will gain full control of the manufacturing IP and R&D at the Dalian unit. The buy will leave SK Hynix in a much stronger position against industry giant Samsung.\n\nMeanwhile, SK Hynix is exiting the image sensor market to concentrate on AI focused memory, according to reports over the weekend. It is a key supplier of high bandwidth memory to GPU giant Nvidia.\n\nAs for Intel, the conclusion of the divestment represents another stage in its ongoing shrinkage. When it comes to flash, Intel had already shuttered its Optane memory business that was designed to offer faster data access than traditional SSDs. Optane was also pitched as being cheaper than DRAM but with slower access speed.\n\nWith the world of politics and technology interwoven these days, Donald Trump last week took time out from cutting intel-sharing with Ukraine to lambast Intel\u2019s leadership since the CEO-ship of co-founder Andy Grove.\n\nIn a White House press conference centered on a $100 billion TSMC investment in the US, Trump repeated his previous claims that Taiwan \u201cstole\u201d the chip industry from its pioneers in the US. But he didn\u2019t blame Taiwan for this. Rather, he said, he fingered previous incumbents of the White House for allowing that to happen.\n\nAs for Intel, he said, the company had lost its way after the Grove era. Trump described Grove, whose autobiography was titled \u201cOnly the Paranoid Survive\u201d as a \u201ctough smart guy\u201d adding \u201cI used to read about him when I was a young man.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did an incredible job, he really dominated the chip businesses, and then he died and I guess they had a series of people that didn\u2019t know what the hell they were doing and we gradually lost the chip business and now it\u2019s almost exclusively in Taiwan.\u201d\n\nTSMC has pledged to build five plants in Arizona. There will be no government funding involved, and Trump took the opportunity to disparage predecessor Joe Biden\u2019s plans to boost US chip manufacturing through subsidies. Trump claimed TSMC\u2019s decision was a result of its fears over his plans to impose tariffs on pretty much everyone.",

In 2023, this segment earned 29.3 billion USD, a nearly 30% drop over two years.\n\nIntel\u2019s total revenue in 2023 was 54.2 billion USD, a decrease of 14% compared to the previous year.\n\nTo reduce risk and expand its offerings, Intel has ventured beyond PCs and servers, entering markets such as AI, the Internet of Things, 5G, and autonomous driving.\n\nIntel has established a new standalone business unit, Intel Foundry, aiming to become the world\u2019s second-largest foundry by 2030.\n\nThe semiconductor foundry market is currently led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, with Intel seeking to surpass Samsung.\n\nIntel faces competition in the computer processor and graphics markets from companies like AMD and Nvidia, especially in the AI sector.\n\nNvidia has been particularly successful in the AI market, though Intel and AMD are also enhancing their AI products.\n\nIntel also competes with Arm Holdings, a British company offering CPU technologies, and has lost some PC chip business to Arm, as seen with Apple\u2019s shift to Arm-based chips.\n\nLooking forward, Intel is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of AI PCs, providing chips that support AI applications.\n\nIntel\u2019s Data Center and AI segment are expected to gain more focus, especially as the AI chip market develops further.\n\nThe continued growth of Intel Foundry and its focus on AI could drive the company\u2019s growth in the coming years.\n\nIntel Meaning?\n\nIntel has always been a leader in innovation, creating important technologies like the transistor and microprocessor. Their continuous effort to develop faster and more efficient chips helps drive progress in the tech industry. With a presence around the world, Intel employs over 10,000 people and has research centers and factories on different continents. As environmental issues become more important, Intel focuses on sustainability by adopting practices to cut energy use and reduce waste in its manufacturing.\n\nGeneral Intel Statistics\n\nIntel started in 1968 when Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore founded it in Santa Clara, California.\n\nThe company was first called NM Electronics but later changed its name to Intel, meaning \u201cIntegrated Electronics.\u201d The founders considered naming it \u201cMoore Noyce\u201d but dropped the idea because it sounded like \u201cMoor Noise.\u201d To secure Intel\u2019s name, they paid USD 15,000.\n\nCurrently, Robert Swan is the CEO of Intel. A surprising fact about the company is that printing one transistor costs less than printing a single letter in a newspaper.\n\nIntel Statistics show that by 2023, Intel had become the 14th most valuable trademark worldwide.\n\nThat year, the company earned around USD 54.2 billion, which was lower than the USD 63.1 billion it made in 2022.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Intel expects revenue between USD 12.2 billion and USD 13.2 billion.\n\nIn 2023, China contributed the most revenue to Intel, USD 14.85 billion, followed by the United States, USD 13.96 billion.\n\nIntel spent USD 16.05 billion on research and development in 2023, while its marketing and administrative expenses exceeded USD 5.6 billion.\n\nThe company\u2019s total land and buildings were worth USD 51.18 billion. It also sponsors the 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nIn 2023, Intel held a significant share (around 68%) of the global x86 microprocessor market. x86 refers to a specific type of processor architecture used in most personal computers.\n\nIntel has many fabrication facilities (fabs) worldwide, producing billions of chips each year.

This suite of innovative offerings could have reinforced positive sentiment around Intel's growth trajectory. The chipmaker's stock surged 8% last month, reflecting optimism amid robust product launches and potential M&A activity with Silver Lake for Altera Corp. The broader market context reveals a volatile environment, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posting consecutive weekly declines despite a solid economic outlook from the Federal Reserve Chair. Notably, AI-focused companies, such as Broadcom and Nvidia, experienced ups and downs, influencing semiconductor investor sentiment. While tech stocks, like Nvidia, saw mixed results, rising the day Musk's Tesla extended declines, Intel's strategic product developments aligned with investor interest, contributing to its notable price increase in February.\n\nClick to explore a detailed breakdown of our findings on Intel.\n\nNasdaqGS:INTC Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the past three years, Intel's total shareholder return, including share price and dividends, declined by 51.81%. This period saw Intel grappling with various challenges impacting its long-term stock performance. Intel's underperformance is evident compared to the broader US market, which returned 11.9% over the past year, and the US Semiconductor industry, which saw a 10% return.\n\nKey factors influencing this downturn include the Q3 2024 earnings report, which revealed a sales decline to US$13.28 billion and a net loss of US$16.64 billion. The suspension of dividends starting the fourth quarter of 2024 prioritized liquidity for investments but affected investor sentiment. In terms of strategic decisions, Intel's ongoing litigation, such as the patent infringement lawsuits, continued to present financial uncertainties. Lastly, the CEO transition announced in December 2024 could have introduced some volatility as the company navigated executive leadership changes during a critical period.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor just doubled down on its investment in U.S. manufacturing.\n\nDuring President Biden's tenure in the Oval Office, his administration made it a point to boost investment in domestic manufacturing. One of the administration's accomplishments came in 2022, when Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act -- a law that seeks to invest $280 billion into research and development and semiconductor manufacturing here in the U.S.\n\nOver the last couple of years, Intel emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of CHIPS Act funding. Given rising investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure -- particularly in data centers and chipware -- I previously predicted that Intel could be a big-time winner under the new Trump administration -- which, like his predecessor, is focused on enhancing domestic manufacturing investments.\n\nHowever, a recent announcement from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.51%) is making me reconsider my cautious optimism around Intel.\n\nLet's explore Intel's latest fumble and assess why Taiwan Semi's latest announcement could be the ultimate checkmate move against its American foundry rival.\n\nIntel can't seem to get out of its own way\n\nLast year, Intel generated $53.1 billion in total revenue. While this represented only a 2% decline year over year, results from the company's foundry business were more alarming.\n\nIn 2024, Intel Foundry generated $17.5 billion in sales -- down 7% year over year. The foundry business competes directly with Taiwan Semi, which owns nearly 60% of the global foundry market. Given that Intel Foundry is decelerating at a faster rate compared to the company's overall business, I'm not too confident Intel is proving that it can catch up to its long-established rivals.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, Intel just announced that it is now delaying opening a new plant in Ohio until 2030. For reference, the plant was supposed to be operational between this year and 2026. Now, it's pushed off until next decade.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's $100 billion move\n\nOn March 4, Taiwan Semi announced that it is investing $100 billion into the U.S. to build three additional fabrication plants, two packaging factories, and a research and development (R&D) center. This investment comes on the heels of an existing $65 billion project in Arizona, where TSMC is building additional manufacturing capabilities.\n\nTSMC's investment in the U.S. is meant to help the company strengthen operational relationships with major customers including Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Qualcomm.\n\nWhat could this mean for Intel?\n\nOver the last several weeks, several tech giants in the Magnificent Seven group have made public their respective plans to invest in AI infrastructure over the next several years. On the surface, you might think that Intel could benefit from rising capital expenditures (capex) from AI's biggest contributors. Instead, TSMC has taken note of Intel's struggles, and I see the company's new $100 billion investment in the U.S. as a move that could further strengthen its already-dominant pulse on the foundry market.\n\nDespite its close relationship with the U.S. government, Intel has shown little (if any) progress from its CHIPS Act grants. This means I'm hard-pressed to buy into a bull narrative around Intel at this point. While there were some rumblings of a potential partnership between Intel and TSMC, I'm yet to see any tangible details emerge. In my eyes, a productive alliance with Taiwan Semi or even a potential acquisition of Intel could be the best outcome for the company right now.\n\nTo me, Intel seems lost, and the company is falling behind its biggest rival during a truly generational revolution underscored by AI. At the end of the day, I think TSMC's investments in the U.S. might just be a checkmate move against Intel.",

Nobody really has the cards,\" Trump told reporters during a gaggle on Air Force One on Sunday evening. \"Russia doesn\u2019t have the cards\u2026What you have to do is you have to make a deal, and you have to stop the killing.

It would have never happened if I was president.\"\n\nDuring the nearly 10-minute gaggle with reporters, Trump fielded questions on a variety of topics, including the types of sanctions or tariffs he may impose on Russia.\n\nEMMANUEL MACRON CALLS 'EMERGENCY MEETING' FOR EUROPEAN LEADERS TO DISCUSS TRUMP: REPORT\n\nThe president explained that he and his team had been looking at their options, but his focus was on a few big meetings coming up in Saudi Arabia, which will include Russia and Ukraine.\n\n\"We\u2019ll see if we can get something done,\" Trump said. \"A lot of people died this week, as you know, in Ukraine \u2013 not only Ukrainians but Russians. So, I think everybody wants to see it get done.

PTC can work without the involvement of the operating system but the newly-posted Linux patches are being done to allow tuning it.On the basis that some OEMs may set too aggressive of a temperature target limit, the Intel PTC Linux patches allow manipulating the target limits so you aren't cutting back the power/performance too much. These Linux patches also allow confirming that the firmware support is in place and enabled.\n\nThe patches acknowledge that Intel PTC is found with Lunar Lake SoCs and upcoming Panther Lake SoCs due to the presence of a new \"PROC_THERMAL_FEATURE_PTC\" bit.On patched kernels, the Intel PTC temperature controls can be manipulated via writing to the /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\\:00\\:04.0/platform_temperature_*_control sysfs directories with a temperature target \"temperature_target\" specified in milli-degrees Celsius.

But he also wants to see a change in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s attitude toward peace talks, the officials said, including a willingness to make concessions such as giving up territory to Russia. Trump also wants Zelenskyy to make some movement toward elections in Ukraine and possibly toward stepping down as his country\u2019s leader, the officials said.\n\nElections in Ukraine have been paused under the country\u2019s constitutional provision for martial law, which has been in effect since Russia invaded in 2022.\n\n\u201cAs President Trump demonstrated by reading President Zelenskyy\u2019s message at the joint session, the Ukrainians have made positive movement. With meetings in Saudi this coming week, we look forward to hearing more positive movement that will hopefully ultimately end this brutal war and bloodshed,\u201d White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said when asked about Trump\u2019s requirements.\n\nRussia has stepped up attacks on Ukraine in the aftermath of the U.S. pause in equipment and intelligence sharing this week, making Friday one of the deadliest days for civilians this year, according to the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. Most of the casualties occurred in the Donetsk region, in territory controlled by Ukraine. Casualty numbers have been higher so far in 2025 than in 2024, the monitoring agency said.\n\nThe U.S. does not have any indication that the pause in intelligence sharing had a direct impact on the Russian attacks, according to the U.S. official and the administration official. They said these large attacks were likely planned before the intelligence and aid stopped.\n\nCongressional Republicans are applying pressure on the White House to restart both aid and intelligence, and the two officials said they are optimistic the flow of weapons and equipment and sharing of intelligence could be restored as early as next week, especially after Zelenskyy said that Ukraine is \u201cready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible.\u201d The Ukrainian president also said he and his team \u201cstand ready to work under President Trump\u2019s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.\u201d\n\nThe officials said the U.S. is still sharing defensive intelligence with Ukraine \u2014 that is, information that helps Ukraine\u2019s self-defense against attacks \u2014 explaining that they still have a duty to warn. But they are not providing targeting information against Russian targets. That means the U.S. can warn Ukraine when intelligence shows that Russians are preparing an attack, but they can no longer provide the targeting coordinates for Ukraine to strike first.\n\nThe U.S. has provided Ukraine with targeting information, satellite imagery and signals intelligence for most of the past three years. European allies are now working to bridge some of the gaps, but the lack of U.S. intelligence is already having an impact on Ukraine every day, according to a Western official.\n\n\u201cEvery day hurts Ukraine, and every day gives Russia a more favorable position,\u201d the official said.",

Read on to learn why.\n\nIntel\u2019s stock has experienced a significant decline of 9.23% over the past week, reflecting a tumultuous period for the tech giant. The recent dismissal of a shareholder lawsuit, which accused Intel of concealing business issues that led to job cuts and a dividend suspension, has not been enough to stabilize investor confidence. The lawsuit centered around claims that Intel delayed revealing a substantial $7 billion operating loss for fiscal 2023, which has weighed heavily on the company\u2019s market perception.\n\nAdditionally, Intel faces competitive pressures as China pushes for the adoption of RISC-V technology, a rival to the x86 technology used by Intel and other U.S. chipmakers. This geopolitical shift could potentially impact Intel\u2019s market share and influence in the global semiconductor industry. The uncertainty surrounding these developments has contributed to the recent volatility in Intel\u2019s stock price.\n\nDespite these challenges, there remains significant interest in Intel\u2019s options market, with notable growth in open interest for call and put options. This suggests that investors are actively positioning themselves for potential future movements in Intel\u2019s stock, reflecting both the risks and opportunities perceived in the company\u2019s current strategic and competitive landscape.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

During the meeting, Zelensky questioned whether the Russians could be trusted to abide by any ceasefire. President Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance responded by berating the Ukrainian leader on camera. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the cards,\" Trump said. \"You\u2019re gambling with World War III.\u201d In the days that followed, the U.S. suspended military aid to Ukraine, including intelligence sharing. Questioned about that decision on Thursday, President Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, said the Ukrainians had \u201cbrought it on themselves.\u201d The U.S. response to Zelensky\u2019s position was \u201csort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,\" Kellogg said. \"Got their attention.\"\n\nThe impact for the Ukrainians has been most acute in the Russian region of Kursk, where the Ukrainian armed forces are struggling to hold a swath of territory that they seized in a shock offensive last August. That assault marked the first foreign invasion of Russian land since World War II, humiliating the Kremlin and drawing thousands of North Korean troops into the war to help Russia regain control of the area. President Zelensky sees that region as a critical source of leverage in any future peace talks with the Russians. His aim is to trade parts of the Kursk area for Ukrainian land that Russia has occupied. \u201cWe will swap one territory for another,\u201d Zelensky told the Guardian last month. Since the U.S. halted intelligence sharing, however, the Russians have made swift advances in Kursk, aiming to cut off Ukrainian supply lines into the region, according to military officers and fresh maps of the battlefield produced by Deep State, an open-source intelligence organization. \u201cIf we do nothing, there will be huge consequences,\u201d the co-founder of Deep State, Roman Pogorily, told local media on Tuesday. The main supply line for Ukrainian troops operating in Kursk is now \u201cunder constant attack,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is impossible to move normally along it.\u201d\n\nA source in the Zelensky government confirmed that operations in the region of Kursk have been worst affected by the loss of access to U.S. intelligence. \u201cNot only Kursk, in all Russian territory there are problems now,\u201d he says. The Ukrainians have lost the ability to detect the approach of Russian bombers and other warplanes as they take off inside Russia. As a result, Ukraine has less time to warn civilians and military personnel about the risk of an approaching airstrike or missile. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous for our people,\u201d the government source says. \u201cIt has to be immediately changed.\u201d Read More: Zelensky\u2019s Oval Office Clash with Trump Draws Pride and Fear in Ukraine The loss of U.S. intelligence has also hurt the ability of Ukrainian forces to launch long- and intermediate-range strikes against Russian targets. Some of those strikes have been conducted in recent years using an American weapon known as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS. When the U.S. first provided these weapons to Ukraine in 2022, it also began sending intelligence from U.S. satellites that allowed for precision strikes against Russian command centers far behind the front lines. \u201cThe satellites allow us to see what the enemy is hiding,\u201d Oleksiy Reznikov, who was then Ukraine\u2019s defense minister, said at the time. \u201cThe HIMARS allow us to destroy it.\u201d\n\nThese capabilities have now been crippled without access to information from U.S. satellites. Even Maxar Technologies, a private space technology company headquartered in Colorado, has stopped sending Ukraine images from its satellites, according to two Ukrainian military officers familiar with the situation. Ukrainian forces have often used satellite images from Maxar to plan long-range strikes against Russia. In an emailed statement to TIME on Friday, Maxar Technologies confirmed the disruption to service in Ukraine. \u201cThe U.S. government has decided to temporarily suspend Ukrainian accounts\u201d in the system that the government uses to provide access to commercial satellite imagery. \u201cMaxar has contracts with the U.S. government and dozens of allied and partner nations around the world to provide satellite imagery and other geospatial data,\u201d it said. \u201cEach customer makes their own decisions on how they use and share that data.\u201d\n\nAdding to the Ukrainian sense of abandonment, the group of Western \u201cpartners\u201d who helped receive and process satellite intelligence at the military headquarters in Kyiv have departed, says the source close to Ukraine\u2019s general staff. \u201cThere\u2019s no one left,\u201d he says, declining to be more specific in identifying what \u201cpartners\u201d he meant.\n\nSome European intelligence agencies have rushed to help fill the gap left by the Trump Administration. But it will take time for them to deploy, and they are not likely to make up for U.S. intelligence capabilities any time soon, two of the Ukrainian officers say. \u201cWe are really thankful to European partners,\u201d one of them says. \u201cThis is the only one solid point that gives us any hope, because without this support, we cannot survive.\u201d",

Moreover, we have seen domestic firms like Intel see all the political attention, mainly due to their importance to the US market, and now, speaking at the Oval Office, President Trump says that Intel's reign under Andy Grove was where the US was a dominant force, and that such times are coming back soon.\n\nTrump speaks from the Oval Office today: - Realizes the important of chips to the world - Says Andy Grove of Intel was a great man - The chip business was stolen/taken from the USA by Taiwan. - IMPORTANT: He blamed prior presidents and administrations for allowing it to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/LqhUX7n30O \u2014 A2THEZ (@awakenowzone) March 7, 2025\n\nYou know, we used to have Intel and it was run by a man named Andy Grove. Andy Grove was a tough smart guy[...]. And then he died, and then there were series of people who didn't know what they were doing and gradually lost the chip business. Now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us, took it from us. I don't blame them, I give them credit. I blame the people who were sitting in this seat, and they allowed it to happen[...]. We will be taking back a big portion of the industry.\n\nWell, it seems like the Trump adminstration knows that the ultimate goal of the chip industry is to bring back production to the US, whether through political influence or any other means. We recently discussed how TSMC has planned to invest $165 billion into the US, building up five facilities in Arizona and a new R&D center, which indicates how determined the US government is right now to fuel domestic chip production.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that Trump has acknowledged that shifting global chip production to Taiwan isn't by means of \"stealing tech\"; rather, it was a flaw of previous administrations. However, this looks to change, at least based on what we see in how the US government deals with chip companies like TSMC and Intel. However, it won't be easy to take out the supply chain from Taiwan to the US since not only does it have financial implications, but it would require a complete technology transfer, one that the Taiwanese government won't agree upon.\n\nIt would be interesting to see how the future pans out for the US chip industry; by the looks of it, firms like Intel will have a major role.",

This creates healthy competition between them and Intel Foundry.\"\n\nWhile Intel's upcoming Panther Lake mobile CPUs are planned to be built on the company's much anticipated 18A process node, the current Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake series of processors primarily use TSMC-produced silicon, with final assembly and packaging handled at Intel's US-based facilities.\n\nAnd while Intel is still reliant on TSMC's advanced silicon to manufacture its products, making use of the Taiwanese chip giant's silicon will likely affect the margins more than if it were made in-house.\n\n(Image credit: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd.)\n\n\"[We are] not quite sure what the right sort of level is,\" said Pitzer, in reference to the 30% figure. \"Is it 20%? Is it 15%? We are working through that.\n\n\"But we will use, I think, external foundry suppliers longer under this new strategy.\"\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nNear enough a year ago, ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger said that he hoped Intel would reduce its dependency on TSMC wafers from 30% to 20%, although much has occurred since then\u2014not least Gelsinger's departure.\n\nGiven Intel's current limbo-like state, and with interim CEOs Dave Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus at the temporary reins, it's perhaps no surprise that this dependency has yet to meaningfully change. As the world awaits the eventual outcome of Intel's current troubles, it remains to be seen if the company will meaningfully decrease its use of TSMC wafers in the near future, or whether the two will perhaps become tied ever closer.\n\nRumours have suggested that TSMC may be interested in taking control of Intel's fabs in future, or perhaps isn't interested at all, or perhaps it could actually be Broadcom with its eyes on the Intel prize.\n\nIt's a confusing and complicated business, this chip manufacturing lark. Still, 30% of Intel's wafers coming from TSMC is a fact that has now been repeated by Intel two years in a row, so at least we can agree on that, yes?",

However, new reports suggest that one of those potential takeover initiators, Broadcom (AVGO) is not that interested after all. The end result proved less than encouraging for investors, and shares dipped modestly in Friday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nWord from Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, made it surprisingly clear with one terse statement during an investment call: \u201cM&A, no, I\u2019m too busy\u2014we\u2019re too busy doing AI and VMware at this point.\u201d That basically\u2014at least for the time being\u2014pulls Broadcom out of the running to buy Intel\u2019s products and chip design divisions the way some had thought it might.\n\nSome have already suggested that today\u2019s losses are directly connected to that simple pronouncement from Tan, calling the news of such an acquisition \u201cpriced-in.\u201d Thus, when the possibility left\u2014at least for now\u2014so too did the price bump.

This came despite some substantially more positive assessment from Gus Richard at Northland just hours ago about Intel\u2019s chances going forward.\n\nCramer noted several points in support of that stark and terrifying summation, noting that Intel is facing the end of \u201cgovernment largesse,\u201d as well as a mounting interest from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) in setting up shop in America. Thus, this combination leaves Intel looking \u201c\u2026way too expensive here at $20 and change\u2026,\u201d and suggests that Intel may have farther to drop from here.\n\nIs Intel a Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock based on one Buy, 25 Holds and five Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.

Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, said the Ukrainians had \"brought this on themselves,\" for not cooperating in peace talks.\n\nU.S. aerospace company Maxar Technologies has also reportedly restricted Ukraine's access to its satellite imagery, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Militarnyi.\n\nUkrainian officials said they are working on alternatives with foreign partners.

(2022 Maxar Technologies)\n\nEffects on battlefield\n\nSeveral soldiers and commanders fighting across the front said that the intelligence cutoff has little to no effect on their battlefield operations.\n\nAt the tactical level, the Ukrainian army has a range of means to get its own intelligence, mostly from drone surveillance. Other sources include the Ukrainian-made situational awareness system Delta, praised by NATO after testing in 2024, and regular reconnaissance operations.\n\n\u201cMy drones give me the intelligence,\u201d said \u2018Spys,\u2019 an artilleryman fighting in Kursk Oblast who is being identified by callsign only for security reasons.\n\nAccording to Samus, American intelligence may have had only a sporadic impact on the frontline.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that the frontline will cope without intelligence from our U.S. partners,\u201d said Yurii Fedorenko, commander of the elite unmanned systems regiment \u201cAchilles\u201d fighting in Kharkiv Oblast.\n\nYaroslav \"Strilok,\" a soldier of the Achilles Strike Drone Battalion, carries a first-person view drone at positions near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025.

But they are turned on to monitor the air situation at long distances when satellites warn of enemy launches of cruise missile carriers or ground- and sea-based ballistic missiles.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. actions deprive the Ukrainian Defense Forces of knowing in advance about the beginning of an air attack,\u201d Kevliuk added.\n\nThe U.S. Airborne Warning & Control System (AWACS) planes used radars that worked 400-500 kilometers deep within Russia, Samus said.\n\nHe underscored that Ukraine\u2019s European partners have the same electronic reconnaissance capabilities and might share this information.\n\nUkrainian rescue services clear debris after a Russian ballistic missile strike in central Kyiv, Ukraine, on Dec. 20, 2024.

            "content": "Intel has provided an update on its Panther Lake and 18A progress, refuting rumors of yield rate and production delay issues, stating that everything is on track.\n\nIntel's Upcoming Panther Lake SoCs Are Right On-Track; 18A Process Is Ready To Tape-Out Externally By H1-2025\n\nIntel and the rumor mill surrounding its foundry division are revolving in full force, given that in the past week, we have seen tremendous developments around 18A and the Panther Lake mobile lineup. Just a few days ago, we reported on how Panther Lake had seen a production delay up to mid-Q4, with consumer products dropping into the market by the next year, which led the market to believe that things aren't looking good with 18A.\n\nHowever, at the recent Morgan Stanley conference, Intel's Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations, John Pitzer, disclosed that PTL is on track and that the delay rumors are not true. Moreover, yield rates with Panther Lake are said to be better than Meteor Lake at the same point in time, which shows that the company won't have many issues switching towards mass production.\n\nYes, it is. I mean, I tend to wake up every morning trying to fish through rumors that are coming across on X or on social media about Intel 18A. I want to be very clear. Panther Lake is on track to launch in the second half of this year. That launch date has not changed. We feel really good about the progress that we are making. In fact, if you look at where our yields are on Panther Lake today, they\u2019re actually slightly ahead at a similar point in time to Meteor Lake.\n\nThe reason why PTL is such a big deal for Intel is that it would mark the first in-house product to feature the 18A process, and given that the semiconductor's performance will dictate the future of the Intel Foundry, the industry has its sight towards Panther Lake and the consumer interest towards it. Speaking on the PTL launch timeline, Pitzer claimed that the lineup is on track for launch by H2; however, peak volume production is expected to occur in 2026, which is similar to what happened with Lunar Lake and Meteor Lake.\n\nNow I\u2019ll remind you that we will launch Panther Lake in the second half of this year [...].And as we\u2019ve said on Panther Lake, we launched in the second half of this year, but it\u2019s really not until next year that we get to that volumes [...].\n\nNow that uncertainty around Panther Lake is over, Pitzer also discussed the progress around 18A, stating that the process is set to compete with TSMC's N2 class products, especially with the SRAM density figures Team Blue has managed to achieve. Moreover, customer samples are now expected to be shipped out in H2, which means that Intel has achieved yield rates sufficient to proceed with mass production soon.\n\nWith Intel clarifying the status of 18A and Panther Lake, it is safe to say that everything looks right according to schedule. It is essential for the IFS to nail the launch of their next process, and given the political influence Intel sees right now, Team Blue has a slim chance when it comes to messing up future product releases.",

            "content": "Although Intel would like to reduce its use of TSMC\u2019s manufacturing services , the company will keep ordering chips from the Taiwan-based foundry for the foreseeable future, a high-ranking executive said at a technology conference yesterday.\n\nIntel\u2019s grand plan is to produce as many products as possible internally at Intel Foundry, but as this may not be the most optimal strategy, it is currently assessing what percentage of its products should be produced at TSMC.\n\n\"I think a year ago we were talking about trying to get [usage of TSMC] to zero as quickly as possible, but that is no longer the strategy,\" said John Pitzer, vice president of corporate planning and investor relations at Intel, at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference. \"We think it is always good to have at least some of our wafers with TSMC. They are a great supplier. This creates healthy competition between them and Intel Foundry.\"\n\nIntel currently produces silicon for its flagship Core 200-series \u2018Arrow Lake\u2019 and \u2018Lunar Lake\u2019 processors for desktops and laptops at TSMC and then assembles them using its Foveros 3D advanced packaging technology at its packaging facilities in the U.S. As a result, the company has to pay TSMC a premium, which significantly hurts its gross margins.\n\nWith its next-generation Core 300-series \u2018Panther Lake\u2019 CPUs, Intel expects to use its own manufacturing facilities, including the most advanced Fab 52 and Fab 62 in Arizona, to make the compute chiplet of the processor using the company\u2019s 18A fabrication technology. Since the majority of manufacturing operations will be performed internally, Intel expects to enjoy higher gross margins with its next-generation products.\n\nHowever, some of Intel\u2019s products will continue to be made at TSMC. Currently, around 30% of Intel\u2019s products are outsourced, but the company expects this share to decrease considerably in the future.\n\n\"Not quite sure what the right sort of [outsourced production] level is,\" said Pitzer. \"Is it 20%? Is it 15%? We are working through that. But we will use, I think, external foundry suppliers longer under this new strategy.\"\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

In fact, the company has never outsourced these parts. And clearly it would prefer not to outsource premium high-volume CPUs for client PCs.\n\n\n\nHowever, Intel may use TSMC\u2019s services to make niche products for client computers as well as various controllers that add tremendous value to Intel\u2019s platforms but are sold for $10\u2013$15.\n\n\n\nSuch controllers usually rely on trailing nodes that Intel currently lacks (since Intel\u2019s 14nm and 22nm process technologies were designed for CPUs and use proprietary IPs). So the use of TSMC and other foundries to make them is a good fit.",

Reports are coming out that two major industry players are considering Intel's advanced 18A manufacturing process. This development marks a pivotal test for Intel Foundry Services, the foundation of the company's IDM 2.0 strategy.\n\nThe outcome could determine Intel's resurgence in the competitive chip manufacturing sector. The market's immediate and volatile reaction to Intel's foundry comeback bid caused their stock price to drop by almost 7%. This drop highlights the high stakes and uncertain outcome of the company\u2019s new endeavor. Investors are closely watching, as this moment could redefine Intel's competitive standing and reshape the semiconductor sector.\n\nGet Intel alerts: Sign Up\n\nInside Intel 18A: Engineering a Foundry Revolution\n\nIntel's 18A process has garnered significant attention from investors due to its potential to redefine the company's position in the semiconductor industry. This process node, Intel's most advanced yet, is designed to deliver unparalleled performance and efficiency, potentially surpassing industry leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE: TSM and Samsung OTCMKTS: SSNLF. Intel 18A is more than an incremental advancement because it represents a strategic move by Intel to reclaim technological leadership and outpace competitors.\n\nThe Whale Watch: Intel Foundry Test\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NASDAQ: NVDA and Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ: AVGO's potential evaluations of Intel's 18A process could transform the industry. Securing either or both of these companies as clients for Intel Foundry Services would be a monumental validation of Intel's technology and foundry capabilities.\n\nThese are precisely the kind of \"anchor clients\" that can catapult a foundry business into the major leagues, lending instant credibility, driving substantial revenue streams, and attracting a cascade of other customers. Landing manufacturing contracts with NVIDIA and Broadcom would signal to the entire industry that Intel is not just a contender but a serious and capable foundry partner for the most demanding, leading-edge chip designs.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to maintain perspective. The current reports indicate that NVIDIA and Broadcom are only testing Intel's 18A process. These evaluations could be preliminary assessments, exploratory probes, or rigorous qualification processes. There is no guarantee that these tests will translate into firm manufacturing commitments or long-term contracts. Whether these evaluations represent genuine steps towards major foundry wins or simply remain as tests will be a critical determinant in gauging the true significance of this news for Intel's foundry comeback.\n\nXeon 6 Launch: Internal Innovation and Foundry Focus\n\nIntel continues to drive innovation and advancements in its core product lines, even as external attention is focused on its foundry ambitions. The recent launch of Intel Xeon 6 processors, which deliver exceptional performance and efficiency for diverse workloads, including AI applications, exemplifies this commitment.\n\nUnveiled at Mobile World Congress 2025, these processors offer substantial performance-per-watt improvements and integrated AI acceleration, making them ideal for data-intensive environments. The Xeon 6 launch signifies that Intel's innovation engine remains active across its business segments. While the foundry transformation is a crucial long-term strategy, the continuous evolution of core products like Xeon is essential for maintaining Intel's competitive edge and meeting customer requirements. This internal innovation is vital as Intel pursues its ambitious foundry goals.\n\nThe Grueling Path to Intel's Comeback\n\nDespite the promising developments surrounding 18A and potential customer interest, it's essential to maintain a realistic perspective on Intel's foundry prospects. The semiconductor foundry industry is notoriously challenging, with high capital requirements, rapid technological advancements, and established industry leaders. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung Electronics have built substantial leads over decades, creating significant barriers to entry. Intel is playing catch-up, trying to compete with companies that already have established customer relationships, large-scale production, and well-developed ecosystems.\n\nIntel Foundry Services is still in its early stages, and the path to profitability and sustainable market share will likely be long and challenging. While the potential rewards are substantial, investors should recognize that Intel's foundry ambitions represent a long-term and uncertain endeavor that requires patience, resilience, and exceptional execution in the face of intense competition.\n\nIntel Co. (INTC) Price Chart for Friday, March, 14, 2025\n\nIntel Stock Drop: Opportunity or Omen?\n\nThe stock market's response to recent Intel news has been volatile. Intel shares initially started to climb in the pre-market due to reports of NVIDIA and Broadcom testing 18A. Still, they then experienced a drop at market open, wiping out earlier gains and sending the stock down about 7%. Several factors could contribute to this market uncertainty. Lingering analyst skepticism about Intel's turnaround and financial difficulties may overshadow the positive 18A developments. Broader market concerns or sector-specific downturns could also put downward pressure on Intel's stock.\n\nThe Intel Foundry Gamble: Patience and Vigilance\n\nFor investors contemplating Intel Corporation, the current terrain demands a strategy defined by patience and vigilance. The potential rewards are undeniably substantial. If Intel's foundry comeback, spearheaded by the 18A process, proves successful and attracts major clients like NVIDIA and Broadcom, the upside for the stock could be significant. Government support through initiatives like the CHIPS Act further bolsters the bull case, potentially creating a favorable policy environment for domestic chip manufacturers like Intel.\n\nIntel Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$27.04\n\n14.09% Upside Reduce\n\nBased on 32 Analyst Ratings Current Price $23.70 High Forecast $62.00 Average Forecast $27.04 Low Forecast $20.00 Intel Stock Forecast Details\n\nHowever, the risks remain considerable. Intel faces immense execution hurdles in its foundry transformation, navigating a fiercely competitive market against well-established giants. Intel\u2019s financial metrics continue to reflect underlying challenges, and analyst sentiment, while acknowledging positive developments, remains largely cautious. Therefore, a rush to invest based solely on speculative news or short-term stock fluctuations would be imprudent.\n\nA measured and strategic approach is recommended over immediate investment. Investors should prioritize the careful monitoring of Intel's turnaround progress by focusing on tangible metrics. Key indicators include concrete announcements of major IFS customer wins beyond testing phases, verifiable progress in the 18A manufacturing ramp and yield improvements, and sustained improvements in Intel's financial performance, particularly gross margins and profitability.\n\nInvestors should remain cautiously optimistic and diligently observe Intel's performance and the ongoing chip wars until metrics show a clear upward trend. The future of Intel and its success in navigating the complexities of the chip wars depends on the execution of its ambitious plans and the unfolding data. Only time will tell if Intel is truly turning the tables.\n\nBefore you consider Intel, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

            "content": "PARIS \u2014 France\u2019s defense minister said the country is sharing intelligence resources with Ukraine, after President Emmanuel Macron floated the idea of expanding the French nuclear deterrent to protect European allies.\n\nThe moves here follow doubts about whether Europe can still count on the United States to help defend against Russian aggression.\n\nThe U.S. stopped sharing intel including satellite observations with Ukraine on Wednesday afternoon, which will have a major operational effect, Armed Forces Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu told France Inter radio on Thursday. Whether European intelligence can replace American intel \u201cis an excellent question,\u201d Lecornu said.\n\nFrance\u2019s intelligence assets are sovereign, \u201cIt has taken longer to build up our strength in recent years, but the advantage is that we have done so effectively with our own capabilities,\u201d Lecornu said. \u201cSo yes, we have intelligence resources, we are letting the Ukrainians benefit from them.\u201d\n\nFor the British, who are in a shared intelligence community with the U.S., \u201cit\u2019s more complicated,\u201d the minister said.\n\nFrance had 15 military satellites in space as of May 2023, compared with six for the United Kingdom and 246 for the U.S., according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. France is scheduled to launch the third of its CSO military observation satellites later today, with the first commercial flight of the Ariane 6 launcher from French Guiana.\n\nLecornu spoke after a televised speech by Macron on Wednesday night, in which the president said he had \u201cdecided to open the strategic debate\u201d on protecting European allies through the country\u2019s nuclear deterrent, in response to a call by the future German chancellor, an apparent reference to Friedrich Merz.\n\nIn any case, the nuclear deterrent would remain in French hands and would not be shared, Lecornu said. However, France\u2019s vital interests are not necessarily limited to its borders, and there is a question of what the country can contribute to collective European security, according to the minister.\n\nLecornu said the French nuclear arsenal is sufficient, and France has been investing \u201ca lot of resources\u201d to ensure its deterrence remains credible, and is working on new warheads, missiles, aircraft and submarines for the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nFrance has around 300 nuclear warheads, with a nuclear doctrine that doesn\u2019t exclude first use, specifically mentioning the possibility of a nuclear warning shot. The country has two delivery vectors: Rafale jets that can carry nuclear-tipped missiles, and its four nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines.\n\nRussia has become a threat to France and Europe \u201cfor years to come,\u201d with plans to strengthen its armed forces with 300,000 additional soldiers, 3,000 tanks and 300 fighter jets, Macron said in his speech. \u201cWho, in this context, can believe that today\u2019s Russia will stop at Ukraine?\u201d\n\nEurope must continue to help Ukraine resist Russia\u2019s invasion so the country can negotiate a \u201csolid peace for themselves and for us,\u201d and peace cannot be lead to Ukraine being abandoned or equate to a Russia-imposed capitulation, Macron said. He said solid guarantees for Ukraine might include the deployment of European forces, though not in a combat role.\n\nThe change in American behavior over the past 10 days has caused \u201castonishment,\u201d according to Lecornu, with Europe facing the return of the Russian threat while no longer being able to count on American reassurance.\n\nLecornu said all shipments of U.S. military aid for Ukraine from Poland have been suspended, and he has been asked by Macron to speed up French aid packages to compensate.\n\nEurope must be ready in case the U.S. is no longer at its side, Macron said. The president said budgetary choices and additional investment in defense have become \u201cindispensable.\u201d\n\nThe French armed forces could reach a \u201csuitable point of fitness\u201d depending on the various missions expected for around \u20ac90 billion ($97 billion) a year, according to Lecornu. That compares to France\u2019s 2025 defense budget of \u20ac50.5 billion and a 2030 target of \u20ac68 billion.\n\nThe French Navy has 15 frigates and \u201cclearly\u201d needs at least three more, and should the U.S. disengage further, France would be forced to hold seas where currently the Americans ensure freedom of navigation, Lecornu said.\n\nThe minister said the Air Force needs around 20 more Rafale jets to carry out simultaneous or lengthy operational missions, while the land forces requires deep-strike capacity as frontlines grow increasingly long. France also needs more electronic-warfare capabilities, based on the example of the war in Ukraine, Lecornu said.\n\nThe one area where Europe needs to \u201cwake up, and this is really urgent,\u201d is space, which is becoming increasingly militarized, according to Lecornu.\n\nRegarding contracts to buy U.S. military equipment, some European capitals may decide they can\u2019t trust a system that is unpredictable, including on the use of weapons, according to Lecornu. He said that \u201cthe day the White House decides that American planes will no longer take off,\u201d the Polish and German armed forces would be deprived of their fighter planes.\n\nRudy Ruitenberg is a Europe correspondent for Defense News.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against other AI news you can\u2019t miss.\n\nThe AI stocks selloff that started following the launch of DeepSeek is still impacting the US markets. Aswath Damodaran, NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance, said in a recent program on CNBC that he believes innovation in AI technology like DeepSeek and new models would \u201ccommoditize\u201d AI products and could result in lower spending.\n\n\u201cIn my view, what it does is reduce the total size of the segment of the AI market that needs high-power chips and immense amounts of data. Whether deep seek is a fake or whether it\u2019s going to pass by, what it opens people\u2019s eyes to is that not all AI products and services need these incredibly powerful chips and huge amounts of data and huge data centers. You can get there with much cheaper devices. I think for many companies, when they look at the AI products and services they have to develop, they don\u2019t need this high-powered stuff. They don\u2019t need to spend the tens of billions of dollars up front.

            "content": "Some U.S. allies are considering scaling back the intelligence they share with Washington in response to the Trump administration\u2019s conciliatory approach to Russia, five sources with direct knowledge of the discussions told NBC News.\n\nThe allies are weighing the move because of concerns about safeguarding foreign assets whose identities could inadvertently be revealed, said the sources, who included two foreign officials.\n\nEvery intelligence agency treats its commitments to foreign agents as sacrosanct, pledging to keep agents safe and shield their identities. Anything that jeopardized that obligation would violate that trust, former officials said, and that could lead some spy services to hold back on some information sharing with Washington.\n\nThe allies, including Israel, Saudi Arabia and members of the so-called Five Eyes spy alliance of English-speaking democracies, are examining how to possibly revise current protocols for sharing intelligence to take the Trump administration\u2019s warming relations with Russia into account, the sources said.\n\n\u201cThose discussions are already happening,\u201d said a source with direct knowledge of the discussions.\n\nOne Western official said the Trump administration has shaken how longtime allies view the United States and whether it can be relied upon.\n\n\u201cThere are serious discussions going on about what information can be shared with the United States. The Five Eyes have always worked on the premise that we don\u2019t spy on each other,\u201d the Western official said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s reliable anymore.\u201d\n\nThe official added, \u201cThat\u2019s right now where we are, and I don\u2019t see any way that changes.\u201d\n\nNo decision or action has been taken, however, the sources said.\n\nThe review is part of a wider examination of the spectrum of relations with Washington among many U.S. allies, including diplomacy, trade and military cooperation, as well as intelligence matters, the sources said.\n\nHistoric implications\n\nThough the extent of a U.S. policy change toward Russia remains unclear, allies are weighing the possible implications of what could be a historic shift, a Western official said.\n\nAsked about allies\u2019 possibly limiting what they share with the United States, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council said President Donald Trump is \u201cclear-eyed\u201d about America\u2019s adversaries.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has unrivaled intelligence capabilities which is exactly why intelligence sharing initiatives such as the Five Eyes exist,\u201d spokesman Brian Hughes said in an email.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is clear-eyed on all threats our adversaries pose to our national security and he will work with any ally or partner who understands the dangerous world inherited after the disastrous Biden years,\u201d he added. \u201cOn Biden\u2019s watch, we had the war in Ukraine, the surrender in Afghanistan, and the slaughter of the innocents on October 7th.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials and some Republican lawmakers have defended Trump\u2019s handling of Russia as a tactic designed to bring Moscow to the negotiating table and clinch a peace deal that would end a destabilizing war in Europe. But distrust of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a veteran KGB officer, remains high among U.S. allies.\n\nThe British Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6's headquarters at Vauxhall Cross in London. Anadolu Agency / Getty Images file\n\nPublicly, longtime U.S. allies downplayed the issue. The United Kingdom, the most important U.S. intelligence partner, said it had no plans to reduce intelligence cooperation with the United States.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is the UK\u2019s closest ally and we will continue to cooperate closely on defence, intelligence and security matters,\u201d a British government spokesperson said in an email. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is totally untrue.\u201d\n\nThe Canada Security Intelligence Service said in a statement that it has strong relationships with numerous U.S. agencies that are \u201clong-standing and resilient.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cCanada deeply values its partnership with the United States, and we believe that it is in the strategic interest of both countries to continue our strong national security cooperation.\u201d\n\nOmer Dostri, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said: \"Regarding Israel, the story is baseless. Israel is not considering such a measure.\"\n\nOfficials from New Zealand, Australia and Saudi Arabia did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSome officials in allied countries, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters, played down the idea that Trump\u2019s policies on Russia would disrupt information sharing that dates back decades. They noted that intelligence can be shared in ways that protect sources and methods.\n\nThe lobby of CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. Kevin Wolf / AP file\n\nBut some former U.S. intelligence officers say they are concerned that the Trump administration may opt to scale back intelligence collection aimed at Russia, as the U.S. may no longer see Russia as a top threat.\n\nThe administration, for example, has indicated it may place a higher priority on efforts to counter drug cartels from Mexico and other countries in the region. Already, the Defense Department has deployed more resources to the southern border, including a team of analysts. And the CIA has launched drone surveillance flights over Mexico as part of that effort.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision this week to pause intelligence assistance to Ukraine, along with military aid, has reinforced concerns among allies. The intelligence cooperation with Kyiv \u2014 which has developed since Russia\u2019s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 \u2014 has benefited both Washington and Kyiv, former officials say, with Ukraine providing valuable insights about Russia.\n\nIn weighing whether to dial back some intelligence sharing, the Five Eyes allies \u2014 the U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand \u2014 and other U.S. partners would have to take into account risks to their own national security if cooperation with Washington were reduced.\n\nCybersecurity concerns\n\nBut recent moves by the Trump administration regarding cybersecurity have also fueled concerns about the administration\u2019s engagement with Moscow.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth last month ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive cyber operations and information operations against Russia, NBC News has reported. It is unclear how long the order will last.\n\nUkrainian servicemen load artillery before firing toward Russian positions in Donetsk on Jan. 22. Evgeniy Maloletka / AP\n\nAnd in a speech at a U.N. working group on cybersecurity last month, a senior State Department official, Liesyl Franz, made no mention of Russia as a top cyber threat and cited only China and Iran.\n\nFor years, including during Trump\u2019s first term, Republican and Democratic administrations have described Russia as one of the most sophisticated and dangerous threats to American cybersecurity.\n\nWith Trump and his deputies echoing some of Russia\u2019s talking points about the Ukraine war and indicating they hope to expand U.S. relations with Moscow, former intelligence officials say the administration may even share some sensitive information with Moscow.\n\nSeveral former U.S. intelligence officers said they and their colleagues still in government are deeply concerned about the possible implications of the administration\u2019s shift toward Russia, in which Moscow may no longer be treated as an adversary.\n\n\u201cPeople are very worried,\u201d a former intelligence official said.\n\nA Ukrainian soldier fires a howitzer near the border with Russia in Lyptsi, eastern Ukraine, on Jan. 10. Wolfgang Schwan / Anadolu via Getty Images file\n\nFormidable alliance\n\nThe Five Eyes alliance is arguably the most formidable espionage alliance in the world. The intelligence cooperation among its members is deeply embedded, dating to the 1940s, and officials have credited it with helping counter the Soviets during the Cold War and foiling terrorist plots in recent decades.\n\nThe sharing of satellite imagery and eavesdropping intelligence among alliance members is extensive, highly integrated and \u201cnearly automatic,\u201d a former intelligence official said.\n\nUnwinding the technical side of the alliance\u2019s cooperation would be complicated and difficult, former officials said. A likelier scenario could have allied governments withholding some intelligence from human sources or analyses that could cause friction with the White House, several former intelligence officials said.\n\nRep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a member of the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said he was deeply concerned by the Trump administration\u2019s \u201crapid pivot towards the Kremlin\u201d and media reports that U.S. Cyber Command was pulling back on cyber operations against Russia.\n\n\u201cRussia is an adversary and, as always, looking for opportunities to sow discord and make trouble for Americans and for the government, so any stand-down or pullback of our operations could be catastrophic,\u201d Crow said in an interview.\n\nThe administration\u2019s actions on cybersecurity have fueled speculation that Washington and Moscow may have come to an informal understanding to pull back from aggressive digital operations to reduce tensions and open the way for more diplomacy.\n\nRep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., during a rally in support of U.S. Agency for International Development on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol on Feb. 5. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images file\n\nIt is possible that the Trump administration and Russia have agreed to \u201ca cyber d\u00e9tente,\u201d said Emily Harding, a former intelligence official. But Harding and other former intelligence officials warned that in past attempts by the United States to forge limited cooperation with Russia, the Kremlin has proved to be an unreliable partner.\n\n\u201cThat sounds good in theory,\u201d said Harding, director of the Intelligence, National Security, and Technology Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington. \u201cI think the next question is whether you think Russia would actually stick to it.\u201d\n\nA hub for cybercriminals\n\nA major hitch to any cyber d\u00e9tente with Moscow is Russia\u2019s status as a hub of cybercriminals who target Americans. Russia does not extradite its citizens, and it has largely refused to work with U.S. law enforcement agencies when they identify hackers attacking American businesses, hospitals and government networks.\n\nOf particular concern is ransomware, in which hackers, often Russian-speaking criminal gangs, deploy malicious software to lock up computer networks and demand payment.\n\nKnown attacks on the U.S. public sector frequently tied to Russia have steadily increased each year through 2024, according to a survey conducted by the cybersecurity company Emsisoft.\n\nThe cybersecurity insurer Coalition found in a report published in October that ransomware attacks around the globe cost companies $353,000 on average last year. In some instances, ransomware gangs have alluded to ties to Russian intelligence.\n\nPhilip Reiner, CEO of the Institute for Security and Technology, a San Francisco think tank that focuses on cybersecurity policy, told NBC News that any new agreement with Russia needs to persuade the Kremlin to rein in its cybercriminals who target Americans, as they rarely face legal repercussions in Russia.\n\n\u201cAny engagement the Trump administration has to normalize relations around cyber has got to take into account the economic terrorism that Russia engages in via ransomware gangs,\u201d Reiner said. \u201cThat has to be a factor in any overall negotiation.\u201d\n\nPrevious U.S. presidents from both parties have tried to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia and explored sharing intelligence about common threats with Moscow. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, President George W. Bush asked U.S. spy agencies to pursue possible collaboration with Russia on terrorism threats. But the effort \u201cwent nowhere fast,\u201d a former intelligence official said.\n\nThe Russians were not interested in sharing sensitive information about terrorist groups, according to former officials.\n\nIn an op-ed in 2020 in The Washington Post, former CIA officer John Sipher and other former colleagues recounted how attempts to increase cooperation with Moscow\u2019s spy services repeatedly failed.\n\n\u201cInside the CIA, we often joked that, to Putin, win-win means I beat you twice,\u201d they wrote. \u201cGood intentions from the U.S. side have proved time and again to have been futile in improving relations.\u201d",

            "content": "COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 Thanks to the bipartisan CHIPS Act, tech giant Intel chose to invest billions in Ohio to develop a massive semiconductor manufacturing plant. But during a speech President Donald Trump gave Tuesday night, he urged Congress to repeal it.\n\nThis exclamation set off concerns inside the Statehouse, especially for people who worked closely to get Intel to the Buckeye State. But a repeal would require enough votes from the U.S. House and Senate. Do they have enough votes?\n\nWell, of Ohio's congressional delegation who responded to me, U.S. Senator Jon Husted was the only member to speak in total support of the CHIPS Act.\n\nHere's what's happening on the ground \u2014 and in D.C.\n\nA bit of context\n\nThe CHIPS Act, signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2022, authorized more than $50 billion in subsidies for creating semiconductors, or chips.\n\nSemiconductors are the chips behind e-commerce, social media, cars, computers, and everything that utilizes digital technology, which nowadays is just about everything.\n\nIntel, working with Ohio's congressional delegation and other members of the federal government, said it would invest in the state if the CHIPS Act was passed.\n\nThe company promised Central Ohio at least $20 billion, now nearly $30 billion, for a plant that would create tens of thousands of jobs.\n\nThe immediate economic impact was supposed to be major, especially for Licking County. The plant was supposed to create 3,000 longer-term, higher-paying jobs, 7,000 construction jobs and tens of thousands of additional jobs. The highest profile were the researchers and facility workers making the chips.\n\nOhio's top politicians have celebrated this extensively since this is a historic investment into not just the state but the entire country.\n\n\"It will determine how Ohio fulfills the promise of becoming the center of high-tech manufacturing in America,\" U.S. Senator Jon Husted, who was then lieutenant governor, said during the groundbreaking in 2022. \"So our children and grandchildren will never have to look beyond Ohio for great career opportunities.\"\n\nBut then came the troubles.\n\nIntel had been stuck in negotiations with the U.S. Department of Commerce. The tech company continued to delay construction multiple times due to this.\n\nFinally, its long-awaited $1.5 billion wasn't awarded until late November 2024. Intel had been approved to get roughly $8 billion total.\n\nEven after receiving the money, Intel has been facing financial issues.\n\nIntel's stock has dropped more than 50% in the last year while the industry has grown more than 120%. After spending 25 years on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Intel was replaced on the index by Nvidia, a leader in artificial intelligence, in late Nov. The company also had mass layoffs in October, cutting 15,000 jobs, slashing its workforce by 15%.\n\nSome officials in Ohio have privately worried that Intel will become another 'Foxconn' scandal. In 2023, Ohio-based Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy and sued international manufacturer Foxconn for failing to live up to and follow through on their massive investment deal.\n\nJust at the end of February, Intel once again delayed.\n\nRELATED: More worries as Intel, once again, delays massive Ohio chipmaking plant\n\nTrump causes a tidal wave\n\n\u201cThis was going to be the Silicon Heartland,\u201d Mike Knisley with the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council told me.\n\nBut could this Central Ohio worksite revert back to dust?\n\n\"This will be a huge setback for Ohio,\" he said. \"It's just so disappointing, Morgan, on so many different levels, [like] from a standpoint of national defense.\"\n\nKnisely has worked closely for years with Intel, the members of Congress and state politicians in order to push the CHIPS Act forward.\n\nBut the future of the project is now being questioned by Trump.\n\n\"Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing,\" the president said during his speech to Congress Tuesday night.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump lamented how the companies aren\u2019t spending the money \u2014 funds they are only starting to receive over the past couple of months.\n\n\"You should get rid of the CHIPS Act,\" he continued. \"And whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt, or any other reason you want to.\"\n\nHe claimed that the companies don't really care about anything except not paying tariffs.\n\n\"They will come because they won\u2019t have to pay tariffs if they build in America,\" he said.\n\nKnisely was appalled.\n\n\"Grandpa's lost his mind,\" he said, noting that he was fine being quoted saying that. \"Really, at the end of the day, whose side are you really on here?\"\n\nState Sen. Bill DeMora (D-Columbus), who has been skeptical of Intel's continual delays from the start, is also panicked.\n\n\"Are we ever going to see Intel built?\" he said. \"Millions and millions and hundreds of millions of dollars and we might get nothing but a white elephant with holes in the ground.\"\n\nGovernor Mike DeWine and the state have already given billions to subsidize the project. Knisely added that the unions and colleges have been training workers. Cities have also been a part of the progress \u2014 Columbus especially, including the effort to build better transportation from the site to the heart of downtown.\n\n\"What does this say to the taxpayer of Ohio?\" I asked the lawmaker.\n\n\"I think it says to the taxpayer that you don't matter,\" he replied.\n\nSenate President Rob McColley (R-Napoleon) said the Biden administration \"dragged\" their feet on getting the money out.\n\n\"The CHIPS Act funding should have been out a while ago,\" McColley said. \"Now I think the point the president was trying to make is that his ideas towards economic development are a little bit different.\"\n\nTrump would be \"much more willing\" to add tariffs to these types of products, as opposed to direct subsidies, the lawmaker added.\n\nWhen I followed up and asked if he would be in favor of repealing it, he said because he doesn't have a vote in the matter, it doesn't matter what he thinks.\n\n\"I think our delegation is paying attention to see where this thing goes and we'll see where it ends up,\" he continued.\n\nHouse Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) was less defensive of the president than McColley. Instead, he wondered what would happen to the remaining money that has already been allocated to Intel.\n\n\"I find it hard to believe that the money is just going to get pulled and somehow would imperil the project,\" the speaker said.\n\nIf something does happen to the money, that will then fall on Intel to stay loyal to Ohio.\n\n\"Certainly I, like everybody else, I'd like for this thing to go full steam ahead and they build all 10 sections and they spend their $100 billion,\" Huffman said about Intel. \"But I don't think they're going to walk away from the $2.3 billion they've already spent in structure and all of that.\"\n\nSenate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino (R-Kirtland) said it\u2019s possible Trump didn\u2019t actually mean a full repeal.\n\n\"It might not be a wholesale elimination of it, maybe downgrading it a bit,\" Cirino said. \"But I think that we're still gonna see Intel come here.\"\n\nCirino doesn't want to repeal the CHIPS Act but said that he would have to go back and take a look at it to see if something could be \"fixed\" so it could be better.\n\n\"There are so many other good reasons to come to Ohio, and they decided to come here before the CHIPS Act was even enacted,\" he added.\n\nThe governor\u2019s team insists that Intel will continue their promise.\n\n\"When Intel announced the New Albany project, they committed to it whether the CHIPS Act was passed or not,\" DeWine spokesperson Dan Tierney said in a statement. \"The company remains committed to onshoring its manufacturing, which aligns with President Trump\u2019s semiconductor strategy and onshoring strategy. Until a firm proposal moves through Congress, it is prudent to reserve comment until more details are known.\"\n\nKnisely doesn't buy this.\n\n\"Right out of the gate, Morgan, CHIPS was part of this whole equation,\" he said.\n\nIntel even delayed the groundbreaking ceremony because the CHIPS Act wasn't signed.\n\nI reached out to each of Ohio\u2019s Republican members of Congress to comment, and I asked each how they would vote on a repeal effort.\n\nNot a single one answered my direct question of how they would vote.\n\nU.S. Senator Jon Husted\n\nHusted has been the face of Intel in Ohio.\n\nIn a statement, he said:\n\n\u201cThe CHIPS Act was a major bipartisan piece of legislation to pass recently, and I am confident bipartisan support remains. For the economic and national security of America, we need to make chips in the USA\u2014I believe this is part of an America First agenda. Making chips in places like Ohio will make sure that China doesn\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nAlthough he didn't address the voting question, he gave the clearest answer that he supports the CHIPS Act.\n\nU.S. Senator Bernie Moreno\n\nMoreno did not respond to our initial request for comment. In an interview with Moreno the day after our story was published, News 5's John Kosich asked him where he stands on repealing the CHIPS Act.\n\n\"Well, what President Trump is saying is that we want semiconductor manufacturing here in Ohio,\" Moreno said. \"As you know, we invent these chips, we invent the design. We're the leading designer of semiconductor chips. We invented the technology. We've let the manufacturing happen overseas.\n\n\"What President Trump is saying is, instead of taking taxpayer dollars and giving it to corporations with a lot of strings that make it almost impossible for those companies to implement \u2014 as you know, Intel didn't get any of the CHIPS Act money until the very last two weeks of the Biden administration \u2014 what he's saying is that tariffs are a much more effective way to do it because these companies will want to build here in America, as we're seeing with TSMC, which is committed to $500 billion of private investment with no money coming from the taxpayer, and I think that's a much better approach.\"\n\nCongressman Dave Joyce, OH-14\n\n\u201cDomestic semiconductor manufacturing and research allows the United States to be independent from our adversaries and Intel\u2019s Ohio One project is designed to help us do just that. Unfortunately, the Biden Administration dropped the ball by failing to implement the CHIPS Act efficiently and effectively, putting our nation\u2019s national security at risk. In Congress, I will continue to work with my colleagues and the administration to improve our domestic semiconductor supply chain.\u201d\n\nCongressman Michael Rulli, OH-06\n\n\"I\u2019ve supported boosting domestic production of semiconductors and Ohio\u2019s Intel project from the beginning. While the Biden approach mandated DEI hiring and other woke giveaways, President Trump\u2019s economic agenda will invigorate American industry without the endless red tape.\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is investing another $100 billion to expand its U.S. operations shows just how effective President Trump\u2019s leadership has already been. I\u2019ll be working with federal, state, and local governments to push for these manufacturing facilities to come to our state\u2014especially the 6th district. President Trump\u2019s America First agenda is simple: manufacturing should happen here, and high-paying jobs should go to American workers first.\"\n\nCongressman Troy Balderson, OH-12\n\n\u201cIntel made a commitment to Ohio and to our kids.

The company's share price was down 4.6% as of 1 p.m. ET.\n\nIntel is slipping following comments made by President Donald Trump during his speech to Congress yesterday urging the cancellation of the CHIPS Act. The stock is now down roughly 26% from its high point in 2025.\n\nIntel stock slumps after Trump criticizes CHIPS Act\n\nIn his speech, Trump laid out his administration's view on tariffs and other aspects of his agenda for the economy and other areas of policy. Trump touted recent commitments to large expansion investments from major tech companies including Apple and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) and criticized the CHIPS Acts approach of directly funding semiconductor companies. Intel was the largest pure-dollar recipient of CHIPS Act funding, and Trump called on Congress to pass legislation canceling the act.\n\nWhat's next for Intel?\n\nThrough the CHIPS Act, Intel had been slated to receive roughly $7.9 billion in direct funding. The company has received $2.2 billion of that total, and it's possible that the additional funding could be canceled if Congress were to pass new legislation. While the makeup of Congress has changed, the CHIPS Act passed with significant bipartisan support, so it's not clear whether Intel is actually in great danger of losing the federal funds.\n\nOn the other hand, there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the company's chip foundry business. Some investors have been hoping that TSMC would step in and buy the unit or partner with Intel to help run its fabrication operations, but the market has turned more cautious on the chances of that happening lately. For better or worse, Intel's near-term stock outlook will likely be heavily impacted by how potential buyouts and federal policies surrounding the U.S. chip industry shape up.",

Here's when it may open Intel, the financially embattled chipmaker, has delayed the opening of its first Ohio factory to 2030 or 2031, multiple years after it was to open.\n\nDespite Trump's call to end the CHIPS Act, Ohio leaders remain committed to Intel's semiconductor factories.\n\nTrump's call to end CHIPS Act funding comes as Intel's financial struggles have led to more delays.\n\nSen. Jon Husted said seeing the CHIPS Act through is important for national security.\n\nOhio leaders remain focused on bringing Intel's semiconductor factories to fruition despite President Donald Trump's call Tuesday to end federal support for it and other microchip plants in the United States.\n\nDuring his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, Trump called the federal CHIPS and Science Act \"a horrible, horrible thing.\" It's unclear whether Congress will follow suit on Trump's call to end funding through the CHIPS Act, which was signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2022.\n\n\"We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn\u2019t mean a thing ... You should get rid of the CHIP Act and whatever\u2019s left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt,\" Trump said Tuesday night.\n\nRead More: Is Intel in trouble? How struggling chipmaker's financial issues may impact Ohio factories\n\nWhen asked to respond to the president's criticism of the CHIPS Act, Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio, expressed support for the legislation. The CHIPS Act was \"one of the only major bipartisan pieces of legislation to pass in the last Congress,\" and would likely be preserved, Husted said in a prepared statement.\n\nHusted, as lieutenant governor, played a pivotal role in helping attract Intel to the state. However, Husted has long been critical of how much time it took the Biden administration to begin awarding Intel its money.\n\nAlthough the CHIPS Act became law in 2020, Intel didn't begin receiving CHIPS funding until December. Husted said at the time he hoped it would help the chipmaker pick up the pace of its Ohio project.\n\n\"I am confident bipartisan support remains,\" Husted said Wednesday. \"For the economic and national security of America, we need to make chips in the USA \u2014 I believe this is part of an America First agenda. Making chips in places like Ohio will make sure that China doesn\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nThe Dispatch has also reached out to the office of Sen. Bernie Moreno, Ohio's other Republican senator, for comment.\n\nDan Tierney, spokesman for Gov. Mike DeWine, said the state will keep a close eye on any moves federal legislators make with regard to the CHIPS Act. But Tierney said Intel remains committed to its $28-billion Ohio One plants that are estimated to hire 3,000 workers once they're up and running.\n\n\"Intel was committed to the fab plants in New Albany, regardless of whether the CHIPS Act was in effect or not,\" Tierney told The Dispatch. \"We'll wait and see what happens. Right now, the CHIPS Act is the law of the land.\"\n\nIntel has received $2.2 billion of its $7.865 billion in funding as part of the federal CHIPS Incentives Program. At least $1.5 billion of that funding was set to go toward the New Albany project, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nTrump's call for an end to the CHIPS Act comes as Intel has suffered a series of financial troubles, which have in part led the company to delay the expected completion of its first Ohio plant to 2030, with an opening set for 2030 or 2031. Intel's second Ohio factory will be finished in 2031 and will open in 2032, according to the company.\n\nIntel originally planned to open its first Ohio factory in 2025, before first delaying it to 2027 and then last week to 2030 or 2031.\n\nYear over year, Intel's annual revenue was down 2% at the end of 2024, compared to the end of 2023, according to the company's financial reports. In August, Intel cut 15,000 jobs \u2014 or about 15% of its workforce \u2014 as part of a $10-billion global restructuring designed to boost profit and improve efficiency.\n\nRead More: How does nearly $1B Anduril project compare to Intel, Honda and other recent Ohio wins?\n\nIntel's stumbles caused its stock to plummet 57% in 2024, despite vast growth in the semiconductor industry, according to the financial service Nasdaq. Intel's stock plunged from $50.25 a share near the end of 2023 to a low of $18.89 in September, before rebounding somewhat this month to $27.39 following comments from Vice President JD Vance about U.S. chip manufacturing.\n\nAlthough Intel's financial struggles have hindered the company's plans, its unclear how much a repeal of CHIPS Act funding would hurt its Ohio project. An Intel spokesperson declined to comment directly on Trump's comments, but the company has said it remains committed to its Ohio project and construction continues at the New Albany site.\n\n\u201cWe know that onshoring chip production to the Ohio One site is critical to American economic and national security,\" said Matt Englehart, spokesman for JobsOhio, the state's private, nonprofit development corporation. \"Intel committed to building the first two fabs before CHIPS Act funding, and construction is moving forward.\u201d\n\nKatie Seewer, spokesperson for the Ohio Democratic Party, called out the Trump administration directly for the president's comments.\n\nSeewer said its members will stand up to billionaires like Trump and Elon Musk \"who would sacrifice Ohio\u2019s economy for their personal gain.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast night, Donald Trump called legislation that creates thousands of jobs and invested billions in our state a \u201chorrible, horrible thing,\u201d Seewer said in a press release. \u201cWhile Donald Trump threatens our jobs, Elon Musk and fellow billionaires are only getting richer and our senators are too weak to really stand up for us. \"\n\nDispatch reporter Jordan Laird contributed to this story.\n\nmfilby@dispatch.com\n\n@MaxFilby",

Operators face high capital expenditures, security concerns, and the need to integrate with legacy systems.\n\nRodr\u00edguez acknowledged that operators seek ways to monetize their networks and generate new revenue streams. She mentioned that 5G standalone (5G SA) deployments are essential for network slicing. \u201cStandalone is important for network slicing, and network slicing is going to be one of the ways to monetize,\u201d she said.\n\nIntel is working with operators to explore new applications at the edge, such as workload consolidation and additional services. The company also addresses the challenge of helping operators sell new services to vertical industries. As Rodr\u00edguez noted, \u201cThere are unlimited possibilities.\u201d",

            "content": "A report from Reuters confirms that Broadcom and Nvidia are still considering Intel\u2019s 18A process, giving the foundry a shot at major contracts from outside customers. Intel\u2019s new 1.8nm process already landed Faraday for a contract to produce 64-core Arm SoCs and caught Microsoft\u2019s eye, among others. But with Broadcom and Nvidia engaged in manufacturing tests, 18A looks like it could have a bright future. That would be a major win for Intel and the vision of its former CEO, Pat Gelsinger.\n\nNaturally, this news comes from unnamed sources, rather than official statements from any of the three companies involved. Foundries typically keep customer details secret, so it\u2019s no surprise that an Intel spokesperson gave Reuters a vague statement without spilling the beans.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard that Broadcom is interested in Intel\u2019s 18A process. Reuters reported last fall that Broadcom was testing 18A wafers. At that time, it appeared that Broadcom was disappointed with the results and thought mass production wasn\u2019t ready yet. Reuters wrote that the tests involving Broadcom and Nvidia \u201chave not been reported previously,\u201d which suggests that the current tests are different.\n\nIntel former CEO\n\nFormer Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger. Credit: Intel\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe focus this time seems to be on Intel\u2019s process, which makes sense, given Broadcom\u2019s earlier concerns. And the testing process can be long, so it may be quite awhile before we get word on whether the two companies decide to proceed with mass-produced chips from Intel.\n\nStill, this looks like a good sign for Intel. With the US government planning high tariffs on semiconductors, Taiwan-based TSMC may be at some disadvantage to Intel (even with its new fab in Arizona), but only if Intel delivers on 18A\u2019s promise. Should the 18A node prove to deliver the expected performance in chips and if Intel can ready it for mass production, Intel could regain its \u201cchipzilla\u201d status. Intel recently launched a site dedicated to its foundry business.\n\nOne has to wonder what Pat Gelsinger thinks of 18A\u2019s possible success. The former Intel chief once said (possibly jokingly) that he was staking the company on 18A. He seemed to view the node as a major breakthrough for Intel, with it being at the end of his \u201cfive nodes in four years\u201d plan. He abruptly retired from Intel last year, with rivals AMD and TSMC enjoying multiple successes.",

Here's when it may open Intel, the financially embattled chipmaker, has delayed the opening of its first Ohio factory to 2030 or 2031, multiple years after it was to open.\n\nDespite delays in the opening of Intel's Ohio factories, the company has already invested billions of dollars in the project.\n\nIntel has hired over 160 employees for its Ohio operations and partnered with numerous local companies.\n\nIntel's first Ohio factories may be delayed several years, but the chipmaker has already spent billions of dollars to make its plants a reality at the New Albany site in Licking County.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, Intel spent $3.7 billion and has signed contracts for another $3.2 billion in work meaning the company is already on the hook for roughly $6.9 billion, according to a progress report filed with the Ohio Department of Development last week. The report, which is part of the Megaproject Tax Credit Agreement that Intel has with Ohio, is filed annually.\n\nWhen the new factories dubbed Ohio One were announced in 2022, the company said it would invest $20 billion. That number has since been increased to an estimated $28 billion.\n\nRead More: Intel delays $28 billion Ohio chip factory in New Albany again, to 2030 or 2031\n\n\"This investment is growing every day as we work to establish a new campus to build leading-edge semiconductor chips right here in Ohio,\" Jim Evers, vice president and Ohio site manager wrote in the progress report addressed to Lydia Mihalik, director of the Ohio Department of Development.\n\nOn the first of two fabs Intel intends to open on the site, construction workers have already poured 130,000 cubic yards of concrete and have begun installing 600 columns and 320 slabs, according to the report. Workers have also begun piecing together the steel trusses of the roof for the first factory. For context, 130,000 cubic yards would equate to pouring a nearly 27-foot solid concrete block over an acre.\n\nOn its second fab, workers have poured around 50,000 cubic yards of concrete and two cranes have been installed to help build the second facility, according to the company's report. Landscaping also began in 2024 with the company planting more than 4,500 trees and 1,400 shrubs across the property.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, Intel's Ohio operation had 163 employees, including 156 who live in Ohio and 7 employees who don't live in the state, the report showed. Intel has said it will hire around 3,000 employees for its first two fabs, once they become operational.\n\nMore than 430 Ohio companies have helped to support the project, including locally-based AEP Ohio, Gilbane and EMH&T, the report shows.\n\nSo far, Intel has received $2.2 billion of its $7.865 billion in funding as part of the federal CHIPS Incentives Program. At least $1.5 billion of that funding was set to go toward the New Albany project, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nRead More: How does nearly $1B Anduril project compare to Intel, Honda and other recent Ohio wins?\n\nAn agreement between Intel and the Ohio Department of Development offered the company $300 million in grants to help with the construction of each factory, as long as they were completed by the end of 2028.\n\nThe progress report for the first time also revealed that Intel delayed the opening of its first semiconductor factory to 2030 or 2031.\n\nBy the time it opens, Intel's first factory will have faced at least five or six years of delays, as it was originally scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Intel's second Ohio factory won't be completed until at least 2031 and will begin running in 2032, according to the company.\n\nThe new timeline comes as Intel continues to struggle financially, which the company cited as a key factor in the latest delay for its Ohio factories.\n\n\"While this timeline is not as aggressive as we'd hoped, we remain fully committed to both fabs and the overall vision for the Ohio site,\" Evers wrote in the report. \"We expect to have continuous construction until the fabs are operational, but we are adjusting the pace of construction to ensure we align the start of production with the needs of our customers and our business.\"\n\nmfilby@dispatch.com\n\n@MaxFilby",

While this may seem like a win for American tech, don't expect TSMC to send its best chip tech to U.S. shores. Instead, the Taiwanese giant will focus on building new plants and an R&D center, leaving its cutting-edge production processes in Taiwan. This could be a game-changer for U.S. chip ambitions but presents an opportunity for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which continues to struggle with delays in its own chip plants, including its much-hyped Ohio facilities, now not expected to be operational until 2030 at the earliest.\n\nIntel, meanwhile, has its eyes on the prize with its 18A manufacturing process. The company is in talks with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), both testing Intel's latest chips, which are crucial for powering AI tech. But it's still a waiting game. Intel has yet to seal the deal with these major players, and after some disappointing results last year, the stakes are high. Even if these tests go well, Intel still has a long road ahead to secure its place as the go-to chip maker for top-tier customers, especially as its AI chip timelines slip further into the future.\n\nIt's clear: the semiconductor battle between Intel and TSMC is heating up. With TSMC doubling down on U.S. production, it's taking its competition with Intel to another level. But Intel is not out of the game yetif it can overcome its delays and secure these high-profile contracts, it could still turn things around. Investors should keep a close eye on how these chips fallIntel's ability to adapt will determine whether it can hold its own or get left behind.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

Valued at a market cap of almost $98.5 billion, the company offers microprocessor and chipset, stand-alone SoC, multichip package and various other semiconductor products.\n\nCompanies worth $10 billion or more are generally classified as \u201clarge-cap stocks,\u201d and Intel fits the label perfectly, with its market cap exceeding this mark, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the semiconductors industry. Intel's competitive edge comes from its advanced manufacturing, strong R&D investments, and dominance in data centers and PC processors. Its chip design and fabrication expertise, along with innovations like Intel 3 and Intel 18A, strengthen its position in the industry. The company is also expanding into AI, cloud computing, and foundry services, positioning itself for future growth.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nDespite its notable strength, this tech giant is currently trading 51.2% below its 52-week high of $46.63, reached on Mar. 8, 2024. However, shares of Intel have gained 1.2% over the past three months, outpacing the broader Dow Jones Industrials Average\u2019s ($DOWI) 3.4% decline during the same time frame.\n\nIn the longer term, Intel has declined 48.1% over the past 52 weeks, massively lagging behind DOWI\u2019s 10.5% return. However, on a YTD basis, shares of Intel are up 13.4%, outpacing DOWI\u2019s 1.5% rise over the same time frame.\n\nTo confirm its recent bullish trend, Intel has been trading above its 50-day moving average since mid-February. However, it has remained below its 200-day moving average since early April, 2024, despite some fluctuations.\n\nOn Mar. 3, shares of Intel fell 4.2% as investors had anticipated a potential partnership or deal between Intel's foundry business and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited(TSM), but no such announcement was made, leading to disappointment and a sell-off in Intel shares. Instead, TSMC and President Trump announced a $100 billion new investment in the U.S. semiconductor industry.\n\nMoreover, the stock fell 2.9% following its Q4 earnings release on Jan. 30, despite beating expectations with an adjusted EPS of $0.13 and revenue of $14.3 billion. However, both figures saw sharp declines, with revenue down 7.4% and earnings plunging 75.9% year-over-year. The company continues to struggle with intense competition in the client computing and data center markets. Adding to investor concerns, its Q1 2025 guidance signals a further sequential revenue decline, reflecting macroeconomic uncertainty and seasonal weakness.\n\nYet, Intel has outpaced its rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) which declined 51.5% over the past 52 weeks and 18.7% on a YTD basis.\n\nDespite Intel\u2019s recent outperformance relative to the Dow, analysts remain cautious about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of \u201cHold\u201d from the 37 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $24.24 suggests a slight 6.6% premium to its current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Neharika Jain did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The stock rose early in yesterday's trading as excitement built that TSMC CEO C.C. Wei could announce an acquisition of Intel's foundry unit or partnership to run the business, but the gains quickly reversed after no news arrived on that front. Adding another layer of bearish complexity to the situation, TSMC's $100 billion investment in U.S. operations could mean that Intel's foundry business will be facing much more competition on its home turf.\n\nWhat's next for Intel?\n\nNews of potential spinoffs and acquisitions will likely continue to play a big role in Intel stock's near-term trading. There have been signs that the company is interested in selling its fabrication business, and some investors have been betting that shares could rally if TSMC or another buyer stepped in and acquired the loss-making unit. Broadcom has also been said to have some interest in buying some or all of the Intel's chip design business.\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has only added to the importance that domestic semiconductor production holds along economic and national defense lines, and Intel has resources and capabilities that could help it attract buyouts or new partnerships.

This development comes from the renowned analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who now claims that Panther Lake (PTL) products won't debut into the markets by 2026 and that the H2 2025 timeline told by Intel to its partners is said to be pushed ahead. This is undoubtedly a huge development for Intel and the future of its foundry division, since with the timeline seeing such a delay, quarterly earnings certainly won't look good.\n\nGiven the typical 2\u20134 week gap between chip and finished product (PC/NB) shipments, PTL notebooks may not become widely available until 2026, implying that Intel will miss the crucial year-end holiday sales season in 2025 and 2H25 revenue and profit will face downside risks. - Ming-Chi Kuo\n\nIt is claimed that Intel hasn't been able to make ground on 18A yield rates, and that internal surveys indicate that the levels in Q3 won't see any improvements to what they are right now, which means that achieving mass-production in the desired timeline is almost impossible for Intel right now. We reported that Intel's 18A node is seeing yield rates at around 20%-30%, which meant that Team Blue wouldn't be able to get into shipping out the process, ultimately leading to a delay in PTL.\n\nIntel will now have to rely on Arrow Lake's performance for the rest of the year, even for the upcoming products from Qualcomm and AMD. This ultimately means that Team Blue will be at a severe disadvantage here since not having an effective competitor simply means lost market share and compromised earnings. Things are getting tight for Intel at the moment, and it seems like the firm needs to step up.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nIntel is once again pushing back its project timeline for two semiconductor plants in New Albany, Ohio, this time to 2030 and 2031, according to a memo sent to employees Friday.\n\nThe chip manufacturer\u2019s Mod 1 and Mod 2 fabrication facilities were previously expected to be ready by the end of 2026, but the project\u2019s timeline was extended to ensure completion in a \u201cfinancially responsible manner,\u201d the memo says.\n\nDespite the slow progress, Intel has already started hiring and training people for the slated campus, with the memo saying \u201cin no way does this diminish our long-term commitment to Ohio.\u201d A prior release said the project would create 3,000 Intel jobs and 7,000 construction jobs over the course of the build.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe $28 billion Ohio One project, which initially broke ground in September 2022, is part of Intel\u2019s long-awaited effort to make the state one of the leading hubs for advanced semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nAt the time, the Biden administration touted Intel\u2019s investment as a boon for the U.S. industry following the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, which has provided billions of dollars in incentives to chipmakers for project funding. However, action on the project has been slow, with multiple delays due in part to changing corporate strategy, market dynamics and limited capital.\n\nIntel received nearly $8 billion in CHIPS funding to support its fabrication expansion in Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon, with $1.5 billion going directly to its Ohio One project in November 2024, two years after the project\u2019s groundbreaking.\n\n\u201cWe are taking a prudent approach to ensure we complete the project in a financially responsible manner that sets up Ohio One for success well into the future,\u201d Naga Chandrasekaran, EVP, chief global operations officer and general manager of Intel Foundry Manufacturing, said in Friday\u2019s memo.\n\nAfter more than 6.4 million work hours on the project, installing underground pipes and pouring 200,000 cubic yards of concrete, Intel completed the basement level of the project last quarter with work on the above-ground structure underway, according to the employee note.\n\n\u201cWe will continue construction at a slower pace, while maintaining the flexibility to accelerate work and the start of operations if customer demand warrants,\u201d Chandrasekaran said.",

            "content": "Comment Former Intel CEO Craig Barrett has a simple solution to the x86 giant's woes.\n\nInstead of splitting the Xeon maker's manufacturing and design businesses in two, as some have suggested, perhaps it's time the board of directors were sacked and Pat Gelsinger is given the opportunity to finish what he started.\n\n\"If we want semiconductor manufacturing leadership in the US, then build on the current resurgence of Intel, don't tear it apart,\" Barrett, who served as chief exec during Intel's silver years of 1998 to 2005, wrote in a scathing op-ed published in Fortune late last week, in which he described repeated calls by former board members to split up the corporation \"the dumbest idea around.\"\n\n... build on the current resurgence of Intel, don't tear it apart\n\n\"In my opinion, a far better move might be to fire the board and rehire Pat Gelsinger to finish the job he has aptly handled over the past few years,\" he added.\n\nGelsinger's return to Intel as CEO in early 2021 was heralded by many \u2014 including El Reg's own vultures \u2014 as a turning point for the struggling chipmaker. Gelsinger's engineering background and ambitious goal to challenge TSMC in the foundry arena were a refreshing detour from the share-buyback-obsessed bean counters that preceded him.\n\n\"Pat Gelsinger, who ran Intel the last three-plus years \u2014 he was abruptly fired two months ago \u2014 did a great job resuscitating the technology development team, and today the company's leading technology is on par with TSMC's 2nm technology,\" Barrett argued.\n\nUnfortunately for Gelsinger, after nearly four years and a particularly dismal 2024, his ambition proved too much for Intel's board which abruptly ousted him in early December. Finding a new CEO has proven an elusive challenge as interim co-CEO and CFO David Zinsner admitted during the corp's most recent earnings call.\n\nIntel CEO Krzanich quits after fling with coworker BEFORE PAT\n\nThis lack of direction and leadership has only served as an accelerant for the rumor mill, which has been churning out courageous reports claiming Broadcom, TSMC, and others were circling for their chance to strip the fallen chip biz for parts.\n\nDespite this perception, Barrett argued that under Gelsinger's watchful gaze, the Pentium titan's foundry business actually regained its competitive edge: \"Intel is back from a technology point of view. They are still struggling to attract independent chip designers, but they have the technology and manufacturing know-how to compete with the likes of TSMC.\"\n\nBarrett also dismantled arguments raised by former board members that spinning off its foundry unit was the only way its competitors would trust Intel to build their chips. \"This thought process ignores the fact that the best technology wins in the semiconductor industry,\" Barrett wrote. \"All the independent designers currently use TSMC because TSMC has the best technology, so they don't have any process technology advantage over each other.\"\n\nTo this end, on Monday it was reported that Broadcom and Nvidia have begun producing test chips on Intel's upcoming 18A process node.\n\nBut while 18A, aka 1.8nm, certainly looks promising both from a technical standpoint and having held Intel's forthcoming Clearwater Forest Xeons in our own claws, the process has yet to prove just how competitive it really is and won't until Panther Lake makes its debut later this year.\n\nHowever, Intel also has geopolitics playing to its favor. The Trump administration's plans to implement tariffs on imported foreign-made semiconductors will no doubt play to the US foundry operator's advantage.\n\nRegardless of whether Gelsinger would be open to returning \u2013 he started at Intel in 1979 aged 18, then left in 2009 to run VMware after Paul Otellini got the top Intel job before returning 12 years later finally as CEO only to be pushed out soon after \u2013 it's hard to find fault in Barrett's logic. A return would arguably offer the clearest and cleanest path forward for the chipmaker. Gelsinger is already intimately familiar with the inner workings of the biz, and is well regarded among his peers in spite of painful staffing cuts implemented last year.\n\nDoing so would almost certainly mean shaking up Intel's board of directors. But, as Barrett correctly points out in his apparent appeal to shareholders, Gelsigner isn't the one responsible for Intel's current state of affairs. The board, he argues, \"bears ultimate responsibility for what has happened to Intel over the last decade.\" \u00ae",

Wei met with President Trump today, and the two announced a $100 billion new investment in the U.S. semiconductor industry. TSMC has previously been named as a potential buyer or partner for Intel's foundry business, and some investors were placing bets that news along these lines would be announced today. But no news about a big deal between Intel and TSMC arrived, and investors quickly sold out of the former company's stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "Intel has new network adapters, at least in some respects, with the Intel E830 200GbE and E610 10GbE NICs. These two new series are expected to roll-out over 2025 and be Intel\u2019s new PCIe Gen4 NICs moving forward. This is a launch where it really paid to read into the details versus the headline features.\n\nIntel E830 200GbE and E610 10GbE NICs Launched\n\nIntel says that its new Intel Ethernet E830 controllers have precision timing and security features while offering up to 200GbE of throughput, up from 100GbE on current models. You will notice that the image is of a dual SFP28 25GbE adapter, and there is a good reason for that as we will see a bit later.\n\nThe Intel Ethernet E610 series is a 10Gbase-T series that supports multi-gigabit speeds and up to 50% lower power. That 50% lower is the TDP difference between the Intel E610-XAT2 and the Intel X550-AT2 dual port 10Gbase-T adapters. There are also single and quad-port options like the E610-XT4 which might actually be a dual E610-XAT2 under the hood since the spec table says it supports bifurcation and a PCIe Gen4 x8 link split into x4 and x4.\n\nIn terms of a network controller and adapter table, this is what Intel provided. There are single and dual 10Gbase-T controllers, as well as a dual 2.5GbE option. We have to give that 2.5GbE NIC a nod since we have The Ultimate Cheap Fanless 2.5GbE Switch Buyers Guide. In this the \u201cPCIe 4.0 Ports\u201d seems to actually mean lanes. Ports are something different in PCIe. Still, this is big since it would be the first multi-port 2.5GbE controller from Intel. Also, a single PCIe Gen4 lane should be enough to handle dual 2.5GbE as an example.\n\nOn the Intel E830, the first slide Intel showed said it was a 200GbE controller and much faster than the prvious generation. The actual first part is going to be the Intel E830-XXVDA2 which is a dual 25GbE part only. Intel says other models will follow, but at launch the E830 should only offer about half the bandwidth of the prior-generation Intel E810 not twice the bandwidth. Intel says additional configurations for the E830 will arrive later in 2025 so hopefully those bring 200GbE speeds.\n\nFinal Words\n\nNew 10GbE, 25GbE, and 2.5GbE adapters in 2025 are a bit surprising. Even launching a 200GbE adapter in 2025 feels a bit behind. The reason for this is quite interesting. In many servers, instead of onboard networking, there are OCP NIC 3.0 slots. So instead of a serer having dual 1GbE, dual 10Gbase-T or other options onboard, these lower-performance NICs are moving to an OCP NIC 3.0 slot. That seems to be the main push of the Xeon E610 and E830 right now. It does not seem to be going after the high-end of the market.\n\nIt is certainly not an understatement to say that after Intel lost its bid for Mellanox (we went into how Jensen and NVIDIA beat Bob Swan and Intel for the company in our Substack) Intel\u2019s networking has never really recovered. NVIDIA has been shipping multiple 400GbE NICs while Intel is launching a 200GbE NIC (we covered Mellanox ConnectX-6 Dx at 200Gbps in 2019.)",

            "content": "Former Intel CEO Craig Barrett said that Intel should not divide its business into two pieces, especially as it just had a technological breakthrough that would allow it to catch up with TSMC\u2019s N2 process node. Barrett said this in his opinion piece on Fortune, in response to the suggestion of a few former Intel directors that championed dividing the chip giant instead of letting TSMC take it over.\n\nBarrett said that the reason why Intel\u2019s foundry business failed in the past years is because it lacked the technology to compete against the Taiwanese chipmaker, not because customers won\u2019t trust Intel since it also makes and sells chips. But now that it\u2019s seeing success with its 18A process technology, he argues that splitting off the foundry will only serve as a distraction and introduce complications. Instead, Intel should focus all its efforts on the 18A node, ensuring that it delivers \u201cgood customer service, fair pricing, guaranteed capacity, and a clear separation of chip designers from their foundry customers\u201d alongside this advanced technology.\n\nAside from speaking up against the notion of splitting up Intel, the former CEO also criticized Intel\u2019s former and current board. He said that the Intel board \u201cbears ultimate responsibility for what has happened to Intel over the last decade\u201d while saying that the next CEO to take the company\u2019s reins should build on Pat Gelsinger\u2019s accomplishments. The former CEO also took a swipe at the four former Intel board members. Barrett said that although they mean well, they were academics and former government bureaucrats who weren\u2019t familiar with the complex workings of running a semiconductor business.\n\nPat Gelsinger, who was ousted as CEO of the company just last December, was one of the key people who led Intel to achieve its recent technological breakthroughs that might put it on par with TSMC. Developing and setting up production for new chip technologies takes years, something that Gelsinger pushed under his watch. In the end, it seems that Craig Barrett thinks that forcing Pat Gelsinger to retire was the wrong move for intel. He says, \u201cIn my opinion, a far better move might be to fire the Intel board and rehire Pat Gelsinger to finish the job he has aptly handled over the past few years.\u201d",

Construction of the second fab should be done in 2031 and operations should begin in 2032.\n\nIntel announced the project in January 2022 and broke ground eight months later at the site in Licking County, just northeast of Columbus. The first plant initially was due to begin operating in 2025, but the project has since been delayed by financial concerns, the departure of its CEO last December and other problems. The company was once a dominant force in the semiconductor industry but has been eclipsed by rival Nvidia, which has cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems.\n\n\"We are taking a prudent approach to ensure we complete the project in a financially responsible manner that sets up Ohio One for success well into the future,\" Naga Chandrasekaran, the executive vice president, chief global operations officer and general manager of Intel Foundry Manufacturing, stated in a message posted on Intel's website. \"We will continue construction at a slower pace, while maintaining the flexibility to accelerate work and the start of operations if customer demand warrants.\"\n\nIntel has received $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion in funding it was due as part of the federal CHIPS Incentives Program.

The two interim CEOs put in Gelsinger\u2019s place, David Zinsner and Michelle \u201cMJ\u201d Johnston Holthaus, will return to their respective positions of CFO and CEO of Intel products.\n\nGelsinger had been at the company since early 2021. His big push was to turn Intel into a \u201cfoundry\u201d for making chips not just of its own design but also from other companies. Intel is supposed to receive $7.86 billion from the Biden administration through the CHIPS Act. According to his public statement, Tan wants Intel to remain a \u201cworld-class foundry.\u201d That will be difficult, considering the company delayed opening its $20 billion Ohio semiconductor factory until 2030.\n\nWe don\u2019t know yet if Tan will be keen on as many antics as Gelsinger was during his tenure. The former Intel CEO once did 10 burpees live before the company\u2019s 13th-gen Raptor Lake CPUs kickoff. In 2024, when the company was suffering blowback for not being quick on the draw for the AI boom, Gelsinger notoriously posted Bible verses to try and calm investor panic.\n\nThe previous CEO had been the face of the company during a scandal involving chip instability issues with its 13th- and 14th-gen CPUs. The company suffered a further blow from its most recent Arrow Lake desktop CPUs, with reviewers noting performance issues compared to the top-of-the-line 14th-gen. The company most recently revealed its Arrow Lake chips for mobile, and we\u2019re keen on getting our hands on them to find out if they can boost performance for this year\u2019s slate of high-end gaming and productivity devices.\n\nTan did say he wants Intel to be an \u201cengineering-focused company,\u201d so hopefully, we\u2019ll see some new stock from one of the world\u2019s most prolific chipmakers.",

The completion of a second plant was postponed until 2031, with operations potentially starting the following year.\n\nIntel Corp\u2019s logo is pictured on a sign outside the Fab 42 microprocessor manufacturing site in Chandler, Arizona, on Oct. 2, 2020. Photo: Reuters\n\n\u201cAs we continue to invest across our US sites, it\u2019s important that we align the start of production of our fabs with the needs of our business and broader market demand,\u201d Intel executive vice president and chief global operations officer Naga Chandrasekaran said in the statement.\n\n\u201cThis has always been our approach, as it allows us to manage our capital responsibly and adapt to the needs of our customers,\u201d he said. Intel, struggling with shrinking sales and mounting losses, has been scaling back efforts to add more manufacturing capacity. The Ohio site has been a symbol of the company\u2019s comeback hopes \u2014 and a broader US push to rebuild the country\u2019s domestic chip production. Intel has had ambitions to turn it into the world\u2019s largest semiconductor facility.\n\nThe chipmaker, which had dominated the industry for decades, is a major recipient of federal funds as part of the US\u2019 CHIPS and Science Act \u2014 bipartisan legislation enacted during former US president Joe Biden\u2019s administration to reverse a shift of manufacturing toward East Asia.\n\nTaxpayer support is contingent on the company reaching milestones in construction, equipping the factories and then starting production. Intel was scheduled to receive US$7.9 billion in direct funding.\n\nIt is not unusual for chip companies to build the shell of new factories and then delay the final steps \u2014 installing the expensive equipment used to make the semiconductors \u2014 while they wait for demand to improve, but the Ohio facility was seen as a crucial piece of Intel\u2019s strategy. The company has been pivoting into the role of a chip foundry, a business that makes electronics for outside clients.\n\nThe company\u2019s plans have been in flux in recent months. Intel ousted chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger late last year and has not named a new permanent leader.\n\nInvestors have even been betting that the company might be sold in pieces \u2014 a scenario that has fueled a stock rebound this year after a steep decline last year.\n\nIn January, Intel\u2019s interim leaders said they would pursue a more cautious, less expansive strategy than Gelsinger did. That means not adding capacity before demand justifies it, or touting big customer wins until that revenue is secured.",

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nOur national NFL reporters have spent the past week in Indianapolis at the annual NFL combine. Of course, the focus was on top 2025 NFL draft prospects working out and running their 40-yard dashes, but the event is also a hotbed for news around the league. Jeremy Fowler and Dan Graziano talked to execs, coaches, agents, scouts, players and other team sources to learn more about what could happen this offseason.\n\nThe franchise tag deadline is on Tuesday, and free agency kicks off in a week's time. We'll see a handful of trades, a ton of signings and even a few extensions in the coming month or so. Then, all 32 teams will add young prospects at the draft in April. We have the latest intel on all of it, as Jeremy and Dan empty their notebooks.\n\nWhat are sources saying about the best free agents, and where might those players land? Where do things stand on the QB landscape after Matthew Stafford's deal was restructured in Los Angeles? Could Myles Garrett get traded? Which stars are set for extensions? And what's the early word on what some teams might do at the draft? Here's everything we heard in Indy.\n\nJump to the latest on:\n\nGiants' QB plan | Darnold's next team\n\nOther QB-needy teams | Garrett trade talks\n\nTeams seeking defense | Sleeper FAs\n\nEmptying the notebooks\n\nGiants' search for a QB continues\n\nGraziano: The Giants' plan at QB after losing out in the Matthew Stafford sweepstakes feels a little unsettled. They could use the No. 3 pick on either Miami's Cam Ward or Colorado's Shedeur Sanders if still on the board, or they could move up to No. 1 to take one of them. A lot of folks believe the Titans are interested in trading out of the top pick, and the Giants and Jets are among the teams believed to be interested in moving up.\n\nAnd even if they draft a signal-caller, the Giants could still add a veteran in case the draft pick needs time to develop. I know they've looked into Aaron Rodgers, but I'm not sure how likely that is to happen. I believe the Giants would have some interest in Kirk Cousins, too, once he's released by the Falcons and is available on a veteran minimum deal. But Cousins comes with health concerns that would have to be addressed first. There was also at least some chatter about them looking into Sam Darnold after the news broke Friday that Stafford was staying in Los Angeles.\n\nAnd while the Giants have done extensive work on the quarterbacks at the top of the draft, there are still people in their building who wouldn't mind staying at No. 3 and picking either Colorado receiver/cornerback Travis Hunter or Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter. Teams like Ward and Sanders, but they're not viewed as surefire franchise-changers the way some of the top quarterbacks in recent years were.\n\nFowler: Yeah, the Giants will be looking at all options at quarterback. They haven't narrowed their focus yet, but expect them to gauge the market of all available QBs. Russell Wilson considers the Giants a potential option for him, should he fail to re-sign with Pittsburgh. And yes, the Rodgers possibility is out there. But some around the league are skeptical. I'm putting this in the \"we will see\" category.\n\nAftermath of Stafford's return to L.A.\n\nFowler: The Matthew Stafford saga dominated this week's combine. The quarterback dominoes could not start to fall without clarity on his future. I go back to what a source close to Stafford told me earlier in the week: He wanted to remain a Ram but needed to feel appreciated and respected. He ranked 16th among quarterbacks in 2025 cash owed ($27 million). That wasn't commensurate with his skillset as a top-10 passer. But Stafford had a great situation in Los Angeles, and trading him made little logical sense. That's why some around the league felt any Stafford pursuit was, in the end, futile.\n\nBut the trade talks appeared very real. The Giants, in particular, made a spirited run. As sources told me, the Giants spent the better part of the past month on this and felt at times that Stafford would be a Giant. They worked very hard to put together an enticing package for both the player and the team, until GM Les Snead notified them that Stafford was staying. (And of course, the Raiders were heavily involved, too.)\n\nplay 1:07 Schefter: Matthew Stafford and Rams agree to run it back Adam Schefter reports on Matthew Stafford agreeing to a restructured contract that keeps the quarterback with the Rams.\n\nCousins' next move\n\nGraziano: Kirk Cousins' $10 million 2026 roster bonus becomes fully guaranteed on the fifth day of the league year, but I was told that isn't a factor in the Falcons' timetable for moving on from him. They've already sunk $90 million into Cousins for less than one year's worth of games, and if they truly believe there's a trade market for him, the extra $10 million won't deter them from hanging on past March 17. Odds are much stronger, however, that they won't find much of a market and will end up releasing Cousins at some point soon.\n\nDarnold's potential return to Minnesota\n\nFowler: While the Vikings are open to Sam Darnold returning, I continue to hear they won't mortgage the future to keep him. There's not much momentum coming out of the combine that the Vikings will franchise tag Darnold, who should have multiple suitors if available. The Giants, Raiders and Titans are among the logical options. And I'm not totally discounting the Steelers here -- not yet, at least. As one high-ranking official with a QB-needy team pointed out to me, Darnold won 14 games for the Vikings in 2024 and is the best option on the market by a wide margin.\n\nOne possibility that shouldn't be overlooked in Minnesota is re-signing Daniel Jones to pair with J.J. McCarthy, whenever he's ready off his knee injury. People I've spoken to believe that's a real consideration for the team. As was told to me, McCarthy has already proven to the staff he's the franchise quarterback, but the team won't rush his timeline; they want the process to unfold organically, whether he's ready now, in camp or in a future year. Jones would be a potential bridge to that and a cheaper alternative to Darnold.\n\nOne more interesting nugget that might mean nothing but is at least noteworthy: The Vikings interviewed Cam Ward at the combine.\n\nplay 2:08 Schefter details Bengals' possible plan for Tee Higgins Adam Schefter joins \"The Pat McAfee Show\" and breaks down what the Bengals could look to do regarding Tee Higgins this offseason.\n\nBrowns' future under center\n\nGraziano: The overwhelming belief of the people I spoke to this week is that the Browns plan to stay put at No. 2 in the draft and take one of the top quarterbacks. Their preference between Cam Ward and Shedeur Sanders is unclear, but if one goes at No. 1, I believe they'd be OK with taking the other.\n\nDeshaun Watson has two years left on his contract at $46 million fully guaranteed each year, but he has had his Achilles tendon repaired twice in the past five months and is likely to miss most, if not all, of the 2025 season. There's a strong chance Watson has played his final game as a Brown. Cleveland is thinking about what comes next at the position.\n\nFowler: The Browns will consider cost when it comes to the quarterback market, given they still owe injured Watson that $92 million over the next two years. People I've talked to expect Daniel Jones to be on their radar, along with Kirk Cousins if he becomes available (though, surprisingly, not every team official is buying that the Falcons will just cut him outright, despite the significant money owed to him). Another name to watch here is Carson Wentz.\n\nSteelers' QB options\n\nFowler: The sense I get is that Justin Fields has an edge over Russell Wilson in Pittsburgh's free agent quarterback pecking order. There is sentiment for Fields in the building, and both sides would be open to a return. The Steelers have at least another week to crystallize those plans, and they certainly haven't ruled out Wilson at this point.\n\nRegardless, Fields should have options. The Jets, for one, are expected to gauge his market. His skillset would fit in Chip Kelly's scheme in Las Vegas, too.\n\nColts looking to add to QB room\n\nFowler: As the Colts look for veteran quarterback options, names on their radar include Daniel Jones, Justin Fields, Trey Lance and Jacoby Brissett. This is a mix of quarterbacks who can support Anthony Richardson and guys who will be looking to start games somewhere. I've heard Jones' name more than once in regards to the Colts.\n\nIndianapolis has not given up on Richardson, but how the team approaches the free agency period will be telling.\n\nGarrett's trade market\n\nGraziano: Teams that have checked in with the Browns about edge rusher Myles Garrett are still being told there's no conversation to be had. The Browns continue to insist they won't trade Garrett, and functionally they'd have a really hard time doing so prior to June 1 anyway. A trade would jump his 2025 cap number from its current $19.7 million to a dead-money charge of $36.2 million. Waiting until after June 1 would allow the Browns to spread that charge out over two seasons.\n\nThe best solution for Cleveland remains working something out to make Garrett happy and keep him in the fold, but he has so far been adamant that's not possible. The Browns may not feel compelled to honor Garrett's trade request until they become convinced he won't play for them, and it's going to be hard for him to convince them of that before they get to the regular season and see whether he's truly willing to miss real games. If the Browns do ever get serious about trading Garrett, I'd expect Buffalo and Philadelphia to be two of the most aggressive pursuers.\n\nFowler: After my talks here in Indy, I believe Cleveland is very dug in and willing to wait him out and show resolve. It's not just a \"no\" to any prospective trades, but an emphatic one. And the Browns haven't received many trade calls, in part because teams know it makes no sense to trade him.\n\nOthers around the league are skeptical, though, suggesting the Browns should capitalize on the multiple first-round picks available to them in order to move on. I just get the impression that the Browns are not moving off their stance any time soon.\n\nNFC South teams getting active\n\nGraziano: Two NFC South teams that I expect to be fairly aggressive in pursuing defensive upgrades in the draft and free agency are the Falcons and Panthers. Carolina is in better shape cap-wise than Atlanta, largely because the Panthers didn't just spent $100 million and the eighth pick in the draft on the same position a year ago. The Falcons are likely to use most, if not all, of their early-round picks on defensive players, and they have some interest in trading their No. 15 pick to collect more draft capital, depending on how the first half of Round 1 shakes out.\n\nExpect the Panthers to be seeking big-name players in free agency. I think Carolina could be in on the top safeties -- Jevon Holland, Camryn Bynum, etc. -- and might be one of the teams willing to spend big to lure defensive tackle Milton Williams away from the Super Bowl champion Eagles. The Panthers will also look to add edge rush help, with Chase Young being one of the intriguing options there.\n\nFowler: I'm hearing the same sort of stuff on the Panthers, and they also want to complete an extension with star corner Jaycee Horn sooner rather than later. That market is due for an explosion, with looming deals for Derek Stingley Jr. and Sauce Gardner. So the Panthers are working to get ahead of that.\n\nOdighizuwa's chances to return to Dallas\n\nGraziano: The Cowboys have done enough work on an Osa Odighizuwa extension that I wouldn't be surprised to see them use the franchise tag on him if a deal isn't completed by Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline -- just to give them more time to complete that deal. They're also hopeful of bringing back free agent cornerback Jourdan Lewis, and they haven't totally ruled out a DeMarcus Lawrence return. However, regardless of how that shakes out, Dallas will be looking to get younger up front on defense.\n\nFowler: The Cowboys have had extensive contract talks with Odighizuwa. A few months ago, I would have said Dallas was out on him. But the Cowboys are making a play here to potentially sign him before March 10. Odighizuwa and Philadelphia's Milton Williams are considered the two top interior defensive linemen.\n\nSneaky center market\n\nGraziano: The Falcons are prepared to lose center Drew Dalman in free agency. They'd like to have him back but are concerned he can get more money elsewhere. They feel good, though, about tendering restricted free agent center Ryan Neuzil and making him the Dalman replacement, which he was during the 2024 season when Dalman missed time due to injury.\n\nFowler: Dalman will easily top the free agent center market and should post a strong number. While Creed Humphrey's four-year, $72 million deal is tough to top, Dalman will do very well.\n\nPackers center Josh Myers has started 50 games for Green Bay since 2022, so he should have a strong market, too. While Myers went down for what appeared to be a significant injury in the playoffs, I'm told he came out of the game unscathed and has no injury from the play. He's getting no treatment and is completely healthy entering free agency.\n\nExtension talks for Stanley\n\nFowler: The sense out of Indy is that the Ravens and left tackle Ronnie Stanley can agree to terms on an extension in the coming days. That's hardly a slam dunk, but there's a sentiment to try to make that happen. Some inside the league are projecting that deal to land somewhere between $21-23 million per year.\n\nWith Alaric Jackson re-signing with the Rams, Stanley going back to the Ravens would help free agent left tackle Cam Robinson, who would have several musical chairs from which to choose. I still suspect the Patriots will target tackles, and don't sleep on the Chiefs, either. Many around the league are loosely expecting the Chiefs to entertain Stanley's market, should he get free.\n\nGet your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. Upgrade to a Disney Bundle plan and start streaming something for everyone today!\n\nShough set to rise in draft class\n\nGraziano: Louisville's Tyler Shough is a down-the-board quarterback name to watch as a potential riser ahead of the draft. Scouts love his ability and instincts, and they point out that his injury history is more bad luck-related than chronic condition-related. For example, he broke his collarbone and his ankle in separate seasons while at Texas Tech, so it's not like he was consistently missing time with, say, hamstring injuries.\n\nShough's problem is going to be that he turns 26 in September, which means he'd be almost 30 by the time his rookie contract runs out. Teams have long been hesitant to use high picks on guys that age. But don't be surprised to keep hearing his name over the next couple of months. He is Mel Kiper Jr.'s eighth-best quarterback in the class.\n\nSleeper free agents getting buzz\n\nFowler: OK, time for my yearly batch of under-the-radar players who might do better than you'd think in free agency:",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nForeign adversaries including Russia and China have recently directed their intelligence services to ramp up recruiting of US federal employees working in national security, targeting those who have been fired or feel they could be soon, according to four people familiar with recent US intelligence on the issue and a document reviewed by CNN.\n\nThe intelligence indicates that foreign adversaries are eager to exploit the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to conduct mass layoffs across the federal workforce \u2013 a plan laid out by the Office of Personnel Management earlier this week.\n\nRussia and China are focusing their efforts on recently fired employees with security clearances and probationary employees at risk of being terminated, who may have valuable information about US critical infrastructure and vital government bureaucracy, two of the sources said. At least two countries have already set up recruitment websites and begun aggressively targeting federal employees on LinkedIn, two of the sources said.\n\nA document produced by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service said the intelligence community assessed with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that foreign adversaries were trying to recruit federal employees and \u201ccapitalize\u201d on the Trump administration\u2019s plans for mass layoffs, according to a partly redacted copy reviewed by CNN.\n\nIt added that foreign intelligence officers were being directed to look for potential sources on LinkedIn, TikTok, RedNote and Reddit.\n\nAt least one foreign intelligence officer directed an asset to create a company profile on Linkedin and post a job advertisement, and to actively pursue federal employees who indicate they are \u201copen to work,\u201d the NCIS document says.\n\nThe adversaries think the employees \u201care at their most vulnerable right now,\u201d another of the sources said. \u201cOut of a job, bitter about being fired, etc.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a lot of imagination to see that these cast aside federal workers with a wealth of institutional knowledge represent staggeringly attractive targets to the intelligence services of our competitors and adversaries,\u201d a third source familiar with the recent US assessments told CNN.\n\nThe intelligence seems to confirm what was previously a hypothetical fear for current and US officials: that the mass firings could offer a rich recruitment opportunity for foreign intelligence services that might seek to exploit financially vulnerable or resentful former employees. The Justice Department has charged multiple former military and intelligence officials for providing US intelligence to China in recent years.\n\n\u201cChina has always been committed to developing relations with the United States on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in each other\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d said Chinese embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu. \u201cWe oppose groundless speculation on China without factual basis.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence as well as the embassy of Russia in Washington for comment.\n\nOfficials have been discussing the risk\n\nCareer officials at the CIA have been quietly discussing that risk and how to mitigate it in the recent weeks, current and former intelligence officials previously told CNN. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard earlier this week suggested that those discussions represented a \u201cthreat\u201d made by disloyal government employees \u2014 rather than a clinical warning of the potential risks posed by President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive cost-cutting strategy \u2014 and that those involved should be penalized.\n\n\u201cI am curious about how they think this is a good tactic to keep their job,\u201d Gabbard told Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters on Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re exposing themselves essentially by making this indirect threat using their propaganda arm through CNN that they\u2019ve used over and over and over again to reveal their hand, that their loyalty is not at all to America. It is not to the American people or the Constitution. It is to themselves.\n\n\u201cAnd these are exactly the kind of people that we need to root out, get rid of so that the patriots who do work in this area, who are committed to our core mission can actually focus on that,\u201d she said.\n\nMultiple current officials across national security agencies who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity expressed frustration at the administration\u2019s response to what they see as very real warnings \u2014 not partisan swiping.\n\n\u201cEmployees that feel they have been mistreated by an employer have historically been much more likely to disclose sensitive information,\u201d said Holden Triplett, who served as director of counterintelligence at the National Security Council in the first Trump administration and is a former FBI attach\u00e9 at the US embassies in Moscow and Beijing. \u201cWe may be creating, albeit somewhat unintentionally, the perfect recruitment environment.\u201d\n\n\u2018This isn\u2019t reality TV\u2019\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t reality TV,\u201d said another former intelligence official. \u201cThere are consequences.\u201d\n\nThe CIA and Defense Department are weighing significant staff cuts. The Pentagon said in a memo last week that over 5,000 probationary employees, who in most cases have been in their job a year or less, could be fired in the short term. And the CIA has already fired more than 20 officers for their work on diversity issues, many of whom are now challenging their dismissal in court.\n\nThe CIA also aggressively seeks to recruit disaffected government employees in adversarial countries \u201call the time,\u201d noted a former intelligence official \u2014 using similar tactics. The agency has released a series of public recruitment videos aimed at persuading disgruntled Russian government employees to spy for the United States, videos that detailed ways to securely contact the agency.\n\n\u201c\u2019Domestic political turbulence in your country? Sign up with us to help us help your country!\u2019\u201d the former official paraphrased the US efforts, adding that those efforts deeply aggravate foreign governments.\n\nThe CIA may have already inadvertently put some American secrets within the grasp of foreign spies and hackers. In an effort to comply with the executive order to downsize the federal workforce, the CIA earlier this month sent the White House an extraordinarily unusual email listing all new hires that have been with the agency for two years or less \u2014 a list that included CIA officers who were preparing to operate under cover \u2014 over an unclassified email server.\n\nSome of those officers, who have had access to classified information about the agency\u2019s operations and tradecraft, may now be terminated as part of the layoffs.\n\nThis story has been updated with new reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Sean Lyngaas contributed reporting.",

            "content": "Intel's stock has surged over 20% recently as investors anticipate a possible company split amidst a rumor suggesting that the Trump administration might push Intel and TSMC to form a joint venture that would take over Intel's manufacturing capacity. Four former directors of Intel wrote a column in the Fortune magazine explaining that this is a terrible idea and proposed spinning off Intel manufacturing to a separate company that would be owned by American investors instead.\n\nSpeculation has arisen that the new U.S. government might pressure Intel and TSMC to form a joint venture that would take over Intel's semiconductor production facilities, which are valued at approximately $108 billion. These facilities span multiple U.S. locations, including Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, with an additional site under development in Ohio. In addition, Intel has fabs in Israel and Ireland. The Trump administration has denied its involvement and said that it would not welcome a Taiwanese company taking over Intel fabs. TSMC's management also denied interest in taking control over Intel's manufacturing capacity.\n\nThe old plan is bad\n\nFormer Intel directors David B. Yoffie (a professor at Harvard Business School, has an extensive background in high-tech business strategy), Reed Hundt (a former chairman of the FCC), Charlene Barshefsky (a lawyer and a former U.S. Trade Representative), and James Plummer (a professor of electrical engineering and former dean of the School of Engineering at Stanford University, has a rich semiconductor background and holds 20 appropriate patents), wrote a column for Fortune magazine condemning the idea of handling Intel manufacturing capacity to TSMC and calling to spin it off and sell to a group of Western investors.\n\nA TSMC-controlled semiconductor industry poses significant risks. Concentrating leading-edge semiconductor production in the U.S. under a foreign entity could weaken American technology firms by creating a near-monopoly, the former directors believe. While companies like Apple, AMD, and Nvidia rely on TSMC today, they still benefit from competitive pressure on the market that is created by Samsung Foundry and will be supported by Intel Foundry if the latter is a success. Intel presents little competition for TSMC as it has only two production nodes to offer. However, if Intel disappears completely, American firms could face reduced bargaining power, the former directors suggest.\n\nA proposed plan\n\nThe former Intel directors think that a more strategic approach would be for Intel to separate its manufacturing division from its design business. In fact, they go as far as saying that the U.S. government should require the company to spin off its production operations and sell them to a Western private investor group. To make this viable, Washington should provide $10 billion in capital as non-voting equity, similar to the 2008 bank bailouts, ensuring taxpayers benefit if the venture succeeds. Additionally, major U.S. semiconductor firms, including Intel's design division, must commit to placing orders to guarantee profitability. The former members of the Intel board of directors believe these measures would make the business attractive to investors while preserving American semiconductor production capabilities.\n\nOn paper, spinning off Intel's manufacturing operations to a separate company sounds like a plausible idea. However, significant technological and business barriers will likely prevent this from happening smoothly, if at all.\n\nIntel's semiconductor production fab chain costs around $108 billion (maybe a bit less if we subtract the cost of office buildings and other non-production assets). Finding an investor willing to buy these manufacturing assets for their value will be hard, to put it mildly, as $100 billion M&A transactions are not common.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

However, committing to an unknown Intel Foundry is a huge risk for companies like AMD, Apple, Intel, and Nvidia, as this might slow down their progress and hinder their growth. Something that happened to AMD's commitment to GlobalFoundries back in the day.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe proposal to handle Intel's manufacturing facilities to TSMC completely omits that Intel has its own process technologies \u2014 Intel 14nm (and older), Intel 10SF/10ESF, Intel 4, and Intel 3 \u2014 and already makes chips in high volumes. Also, the company is about to launch high-volume manufacturing of its Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest, with its 18A process technology, and get third-party 18A tape-ins in mid-2025. Discussions about spinning off Intel's fabs to a separate entity run by TSMC would hurt Intel's negotiations with potential 18A customers.\n\nBut let's assume that Intel and TSMC agreed to form a joint venture to run Intel's fabs., and that Intel keeps making chips on its Intel 4, Intel 3, and 18A process technologies, but TSMC would like to also make chips on Intel's capacity as well. Transferring TSMC's fabrication technology to Intel's U.S. factories with EUV capabilities would be highly complex. Although both companies use EUV lithography, their equipment setups, fab configurations, and vendor-specific modifications differ significantly. ASML's lithography tools, for instance, are custom-calibrated for each company. Intel and TSMC also have distinct etching, deposition, and process control methods, all of which influence production tools.\n\nA joint venture would hurt TSMC's profit margins. The only reason TSMC might consider working with Intel is if a Trump administration introduced tariffs forcing it to manufacture its advanced 3nm and 2nm chips in the U.S. However, Intel lacks sufficient EUV production capacity in the U.S. to meet demand for both its own products and those of TSMC's clients. Instead, TSMC is accelerating its own Arizona fabs to support 3nm and 2nm production, which is a more viable business strategy, as industry analysts have suggested.\n\nEven if TSMC was compelled to take control of Intel's capacity, its most advanced research would remain in Taiwan, and over time, it might close Intel's factories and lay off most of its workforce.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that Intel also has non-EUV capacity designed to produce Intel's own products. TSMC will unlikely be able to port its nodes to production lines meant for Intel 14nm (and older) and Intel 10SF/10ESF (at least, not in a financially viable way). These production capacities are worth billions for Intel as they produce sellable products. For an external company (whether TSMC or a group of investors), they will unlikely pose that much value as Intel would remain the only customer for those nodes and fabs. Meanwhile, at some point, those fabs will either have to be upgraded (which means additional investments), or shut down (something that the former members of the board mentioned above), which means writing off billions of dollars.",

A fix was merged yesterday for a Linux kernel bug introduced in late 2019 to the Intel Idle driver. A few months back a user reported a Linux kernel regression that when upgrading from Debian Bullseye to Debian Bookworm, he found his system getting stuck in the boot process for more than 60 seconds.\n\nThe issue comes down to the modern Intel Idle driver not implementing a workaround for Intel Core 2 generation processors where the time stamp counter (TSC) stops in C2 and deeper C-states. In turn this causes stalls and boot delays. The ACPI driver had marked the TSC unstable when noting this situation while only now the Intel Idle driver is making this workaround.\n\nSo this fix is merged to Linux 6.14 Git ahead of Linux 6.14-rc5 on Sunday to fix this stalled boot / stuck behavior on old Intel Core 2 systems. The workaround will also be back-ported to stable series in the coming days for those still relying on Intel Core 2 hardware.",

            "content": "There has been little good news to come out of Intel in recent memory, and now the storied chipmaker has announced it will postpone the opening of a new Ohio semiconductor factory that was originally slated to begin operating this year. The company said Friday it will not will be finished with construction on the plant until 2030, and likely begin production in 2031. Bloomberg earlier reported on the news.\n\nThe announcement is a blow to the United States\u2019 ambition to become a semiconductor superpower. Intel is a major centerpiece of the plan that would help America become less exposed to Taiwan as it faces threats from China.\n\nIntel is set to receive $7.9 billion in funding from the federal government through the CHIPS Act, but the company must reach certain milestones, from construction to starting production. The CHIPS Act was a bill put forth by President Biden that received bipartisan support to bring chip production back to the U.S. Reports indicate that President Trump is delaying payments and looking to renegotiate terms of some of the deals with chipmakers set to receive funding, potentially slowing down Intel at a time when rivals are only speeding up. Among other concerns, the Trump administration wants to remove requirements that new factories offer workers paid paternal leave.\n\nIntel already has chip manufacturing located domestically, but primarily to build its own chipsets. Its business making chips for other clients has never quite taken off, as experts have said the company was not adept at catering to other companies\u2019 needs like Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, today the largest chipmaker in the world that has perfected advanced nanometer-process semiconductors at scale. President Trump earlier this week declined to say whether or not the U.S. would intervene should Taiwan be invaded by China. Some estimates suggest that if China took over Taiwan and cut off access to TSMC, the U.S. economy could lose 8% of GDP and untold numbers of jobs, since many electronics rely on TSMC-built chips.\n\nIntel was always going to be a risky bet for a U.S. chip renaissance. The company, once a shining beacon of Silicon Valley, missed numerous major technological shifts, most famously declining to develop a mobile chip for the original iPhone, ceding the smartphone business to the likes of Arm and Apple. It never invested heavily in GPUs either, leading Nvidia to recently become one of the biggest companies in the world and capture much of the profit from the AI boom.\n\nIntel tried getting into the business of developing mobile cellular antennas, but abandoned that venture and sold it to Apple, which recently launched the iPhone 16e with its first modem. And with low-powered chips originally designed for mobile becoming more capable, Intel is even losing ground in PCs. It has been miss after miss for Intel as it never quite focused its energy on the right bets, and has strong competitors eating away at its market share from every direction.\n\nSome critics argue Intel should focus on what it always did best: Chip design. The idea of \u201cMoore\u2019s Law\u201d came out of the company. The idea theorized that the number of transistors on a chip would double every two years, making smaller chips more capable. But TSMC has it beaten there at scale today. Maybe because of intense Taiwanese work ethic, maybe because Intel lost focus.\n\nRecent reports have suggested that Intel is considering the possibility of splitting up entirely, selling its chip design business to Broadcom and the manufacturing side to TSMC. The company has laid off thousands of employees in recent years amid shrinking sales and increasing losses; its stock is down more than 50% in the past five years. It is unclear whether the Trump administration would allow TSMC to take over Intel\u2019s factories, considering it is a foreign company.\n\nIt all goes to show how even once-great titans of industry can fall from grace through management missteps, and perhaps explains why the big tech companies today are pouring billions into AI before knowing whether or not returns will come. They do not want to be the next Intel.",

The company now expects its first factory in New Albany to be operational only by 2030 or 2031\u2014half a decade later than initially planned. This follows its decision last June to freeze a $25 billion expansion of its Kiryat Gat facility in Israel. Together, these developments underscore the mounting financial and strategic difficulties Intel faces as it attempts to reposition itself in the semiconductor industry.\n\nIntel\u2019s decision to postpone the Ohio project further reflects the harsh realities of its aggressive push into contract chip manufacturing, an effort aimed at competing with dominant foundries like Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea\u2019s Samsung. This transition, intended to restore Intel\u2019s competitive edge, has strained the company\u2019s balance sheet and forced it to scale back capital-intensive investments.\n\n1 View gallery Intel offices. ( Photo: Nir Keidar )\n\nA global pattern of delays\n\nThe slowdown in Ohio is not an isolated event but part of a broader retrenchment. The pause in Kiryat Gat, which Intel initially downplayed as a routine scheduling adjustment, signaled that the company was grappling with deeper financial constraints and strategic uncertainty. While some of the Israeli factory\u2019s operations continue, Intel has yet to decide on the specific technology and customer base for its second production line there\u2014reflecting a cautious approach to capital deployment.\n\nThe situation in Ohio follows a similar trajectory. Intel originally presented the project as a flagship investment in America\u2019s semiconductor renaissance, bolstered by $8.5 billion in direct financing and $25 billion in tax incentives under the CHIPS Act. However, as with Kiryat Gat, Intel is now tempering expectations, opting for a phased construction process rather than the ambitious timeline it initially laid out.\n\nMounting financial pressures\n\nIntel\u2019s financial health has deteriorated significantly over the past two years. The company\u2019s revenue has been declining amid fierce competition from Nvidia and AMD, particularly in the AI-driven semiconductor market. In response, Intel has taken aggressive cost-cutting measures, including layoffs affecting 15% of its workforce, a suspended dividend, and a reduction in capital expenditures.\n\nDavid Zinsner, Intel\u2019s chief financial officer, has made clear that the company is prioritizing financial discipline, with a goal of capping operating expenses at $17.5 billion for 2025. This explains Intel\u2019s caution in rolling out new factories\u2014each representing a multibillion-dollar investment that requires strong customer demand to justify. Unlike its competitors, which enjoy steady orders from key partners, Intel is still struggling to secure long-term commitments for its contract chip manufacturing division.\n\nThe foundry gamble and its challenges\n\nIntel\u2019s pivot toward contract manufacturing\u2014its so-called \"foundry\" model\u2014was meant to position the company as a serious alternative to TSMC and Samsung. However, the transition has proven difficult, particularly as global semiconductor supply chains remain in flux. While Intel has received government support in both the U.S. and Israel, these incentives have not been enough to offset its internal struggles.\n\nWith the Kiryat Gat expansion in limbo and the Ohio project now pushed into the next decade, Intel faces an increasingly difficult road ahead. Former CEO Pat Gelsinger\u2019s vision of transforming the company into a dominant force in contract chip manufacturing is still far from being realized. The delays highlight not just financial caution but also strategic uncertainty\u2014Intel cannot afford to miscalculate, yet its hesitancy risks leaving it further behind in an industry defined by rapid technological advancement.",

The setback is the third substantial delay from the facility's original 2025 completion target. Intel emphasizes its commitment to the project and its ability to accelerate construction if market demand warrants.\n\nThe first phase of the facility, known as Mod 1, should be finished in 2030, with chip production beginning between 2030 and 2031. The company's revised timeline also affects the project's second phase, Mod 2, pushing it back to a 2031 completion date, with operations beginning in 2032.\n\nThe Ohio One campus, once dubbed the \"Silicon Heartland,\" is an ambitious undertaking. It will span approximately 1,000 acres and include up to eight semiconductor fabrication plants. The site will also accommodate support operations and industry partners. Initial investment estimates were around $20 billion, with potential for up to $100 billion in total development costs.\n\nDespite the frequent delays, the site has made significant construction progress since work began in 2022. Key milestones include completion of the underground foundation, commencement of above-ground construction, installation of air separation units and underground piping, pouring over 200,000 cubic yards of concrete, and more than 6.4 million hours of invested labor.\n\nThe revised timeline reveals that the Ohio facilities will utilize process technologies developed after Intel's 14A and 14A-E nodes, currently scheduled for introduction in 2026-2027. These advanced manufacturing processes will likely rely on ASML's cutting-edge High-NA EUV lithography tools, costing around $350 million each.\n\nIntel has already begun hiring and training employees for the Ohio facility. Workers are receiving training at existing Intel sites in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, preparing them for the eventual opening of the local facility.\n\nIntel's decision to delay the Ohio plant opening comes amid a challenging period for the company and the semiconductor industry. The past year has seen Intel grappling with financial losses, layoffs, and leadership changes. The company has also made strategic decisions to simplify its product roadmap, including canceling an AI chip project.\n\nWhile the delay may raise concerns about Intel's outlook on future demand, it also allows the company to manage its capital expenditures more effectively during market uncertainty.

Instead, Intel's latest major delay comes amid the \"needs\" of the business and \"broader market demand,\" according to executive Naga Chandrasekaran.\n\nThe company promised Central Ohio at least $20 billion, now nearly $30 billion, for a plant that would create tens of thousands of jobs. This wouldn't have been possible without the CHIPS Act, which President Joe Biden signed in August 2022.\n\nThe immediate economic impact was supposed to be major, especially for Licking County. The plant was supposed to create 3,000 longer-term, higher-paying jobs, 7,000 construction jobs and tens of thousands of additional jobs. The highest profile were the researchers and facility workers making the chips.\n\nSemiconductors are the chips behind e-commerce, social media, cars, computers and everything that utilizes digital technology, which nowadays is just about everything.\n\nNow, Ohio is anticipating two fabrication facilities \u2014 the original is set to be constructed in 2030 with operations beginning by 2031. The second would be completed in 2031 and begin in 2032.\n\n\"We're just really on for a little bit longer ride than what we thought,\" said Mike Knisley with the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council.\n\nIntel previously blamed delays over the past few years on the lack of the CHIPS Act money, but they received $1.5 billion for the Ohio plant from federal funding in November.\n\nOhio's Intel plant moving forward with long-awaited CHIPS Act funding\n\nRELATED: Ohio's Intel plant moving forward with long-awaited CHIPS Act funding\n\nBut now, Chandrasekaran said the company is continuing construction at a \u201cslower pace,\u201d something that Knisely said is part of industry norms \u2014 but he also understood why it is concerning.\n\n\"We've got to have faith in that company,\" he said. \"It would be disastrous for everybody, not just the trade unions, but for the administration, for the millions of dollars that have been spent on incentives and things like that.\"\n\nState Sen. Bill DeMora (D-Columbus) argued that Ohio needs to hold Intel accountable.\n\n\"Intel is a huge company, and it's gonna be a lot of jobs and it's a huge project, but you can't let them just hold the state hostage for as long as they want to,\" DeMora said. \"It's ridiculous.\"\n\nGovernor Mike DeWine and the state have already given billions to subsidize the project. Knisely added that the unions and colleges have been training workers. Cities have also been a part of the progress.\n\n\"The City of Columbus is planning a nonstop bus route down 161 to get to Intel,\" DeMora said, adding about other types of deals Franklin County is making to help out the neighboring county.\n\nWorkers have been waiting while the days pass by, Knisley added.\n\n\"Some of the larger unions, electrical workers and the pipefitters, spent an enormous amount of money on training, getting ready for this,\" he said. \"We've got a fallback position on this and all the work in Central Ohio. Had we not had that, and we had made all this investment on recruiting and training, it could have been a real detriment to the unions to put that kind of investment in [and not have it pan out] \u2014 but thank God that we have other investors around the area.\"\n\nDeMora has been concerned about the tech company for months now.\n\nFormer CEO Pat Gelsinger suddenly resigned in December.\n\nWhere is the CHIPS Act funding for Ohio's Intel plant?\n\nRELATED: Where is the CHIPS Act funding for Ohio's Intel plant?\n\nIntel's stock has dropped more than 50% in the last year while the industry has grown more than 120%. After spending 25 years on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Intel was replaced on the index by Nvidia, a leader in artificial intelligence, in late November. The company also had mass layoffs in October, cutting 15,000 jobs, slashing its workforce by 15%.\n\nSome officials in Ohio have privately worried that Intel will become another 'Foxconn' scandal. In 2023, Ohio-based Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy and sued international manufacturer Foxconn for failing to live up to and follow through on their massive investment deal.\n\n\"At some point, you got to hold their feet to the fire and either take away some of their tax incentives, start charging them \u2014 start taking back some of the money they were promised until they actually do what they're supposed to do,\" DeMora said.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Development defended the company in a statement to us.\n\n\u201cIntel\u2019s latest report highlights the progress the company is making on its Ohio One project. The statewide economic impact of this investment is already evident\u20146.4 million construction hours worked by Ohioans from 83 counties, and more than 430 Ohio companies supporting the effort across 50 counties. We remain confident that Intel will deliver on its commitments to the State of Ohio, and we have every indication that the plants will become operational. Large-scale projects of this magnitude are inherently complex, and while we hope to have the plants online sooner, construction estimates may shift. However, as the agreement stands, Intel is still expected to meet its investment, job, and payroll commitments by 2028, and that has not changed,\u201d spokesperson Mason Waldvogel said.\n\nDeWine's team also said they still believe in Intel.\n\n\"While we are disappointed the plants will not open sooner, construction continues at the Ohio Intel site and the company has continued to tell the state the fabs will be completed and produce chips,\" DeWine's spokesperson Dan Tierney said. \"This is a construction delay. The project is moving forward.\"\n\nJobsOhio, a private nonprofit that is, for clarity, a partner of the state when it comes to economic development, is also following the same rhetoric.\n\n\u201cAlthough Intel\u2019s timeline has moved to address market realities, the commitment to creating at least 3,000 jobs and $20 billion in capital investment while continuing construction of its most advanced chip production fabs on Earth in Ohio remains unchanged. One of the competitive advantages of choosing Ohio is that we are a flexible partner with the ability to work alongside Intel as it moves the project forward on its adjusted timeline, placing Ohio at the center of cutting-edge semiconductor production that is essential to American national economic security and national defense,\u201d spokesperson Matt Englehart said.\n\nBut DeMora wondered if Intel was breaking their agreement to the state by continually delaying.\n\nNo, according to the governor's office.\n\nRecourse\n\nIn a back-and-forth with Tierney, he did explain some of the clawback provisions, which are ways for Ohio to get its money back if Intel underperforms.\n\n\"The terms are that they have to make a specific investment, they have to maintain a specific payroll and they have to keep a specific number of jobs,\" Tierney said, saying that Intel is making all of those requirements right now.\n\nWhat isn't in the contract? A way to ensure the project is completed or operating by a certain date or timeframe. I asked why not.\n\n\"The company is upholding its end of the bargain,\" Tierney said. \"So why argue today over a provision that's not in the contract and really has nothing to do with what was promised \u2014 which was money spent in the state of Ohio's economy and jobs being created.\"\n\nI asked why not have both the benchmarks he mentioned and a completion date provision.\n\n\"The purpose of a clawback provision is to get the company to do what it promised, and what it promised was investment and jobs \u2014 and those are the terms that we will look at at the appropriate time, which again is far in the future,\" he said, noting that the date Intel needs to meet their commitments is in 2028.\n\nCase Western Reserve University business law professor Eric Chaffee said that it is standard to have completion clauses. But because construction is a fickle \u2014 and because Ohio clearly really wanted this project \u2014 some bargaining was likely done.\n\n\"In regard to thinking about contract law, it's about building relationships between parties, and you have to make choices about what's important in regard to those relationships,\" Chaffee said. \"Ohio made choices in regard to what they wanted to insure. There's still incentives, as far as I can tell, for Intel to get this facility completed, but there's just not the penalties that might make them a little bit more incentivized to do that.\"\n\nThey don't need a completion clause because they already have the benchmarks, Tierney argued.\n\n\"We live in the real world where we're competing against other states to build things here,\" the spokesperson answered.\n\nStill, Knisley believes the project will be completed.\n\n\"Everybody is bullish on Intel, even with their poor performance on Wall Street, the change in leadership,\" he said. \"A lot of things that might give people pause on this, but Morgan, we still have all the faith that the project's going to go on.\"\n\nIntel confirmed to me that they are still dedicated to Ohio, and their official comment said that this delay does not \"diminish our long-term commitment.\"\n\nFollow WEWS statehouse reporter Morgan Trau on Twitter and Facebook.",

Here's when it may open Intel, the financially embattled chipmaker, has delayed the opening of its first Ohio factory to 2030 or 2031, multiple years after it was to open.\n\nIntel has delayed the opening of its first Ohio semiconductor factory to 2030.\n\nThe delay was attributed to financial struggles and a need to align chip production with market demand.\n\nIntel says it remains committed to its Ohio project and has already invested $3.7 billion locally.\n\n(Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated with additional information as it becomes available).\n\nIntel's promised $28 billion semiconductor project in central Ohio has been delayed again, this time by several years.\n\nThe chipmaker told The Dispatch late Thursday that its first factory in the Licking County portion of New Albany would not be completed until 2030 and would begin operations sometime shortly thereafter in either 2030 or 2031\u2014 a sign of just how much remains in flux despite the company's commitment to its Ohio One operation.\n\nBy the time it opens, Intel's first factory will have faced at least five or six years of delays, as it was originally scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Intel's second Ohio factory won't be completed until at least 2031 and will begin running in 2032, according to the company.\n\nThe new timeline comes as Intel continues to struggle financially, which was a key factor in the latest delay for the company's Ohio factories. The company was alerting its employees of the delays in a message Friday.\n\nManufacturing in central Ohio: How does nearly $1B Anduril project compare to Intel, Honda and other recent Ohio wins?\n\nDispatch Editorial Board: The Intel delay is alarming. Here's why the project means so much.\n\nThe changes were made so Intel can align its factory operation with market demand and better \"manage our capital responsibly,\" Naga Chandrasekaran, executive vice president, chief global operations officer and general manager of Intel Foundry Manufacturing wrote in a message to workers. The changes will ensure Intel's Ohio fabs will be finished in a \"financially responsible manner that sets up Ohio One for success,\" Chandrasekaran wrote.\n\n\"I wanted to be upfront and transparent with you all about our current plan. In no way does this diminish our long-term commitment to Ohio,\" Chandrasekaran wrote. \"(W)e will continue to scale our hiring as we approach our operational dates. Intel is proud to call Ohio home, and we remain excited about our future here.\"\n\nIntel's Ohio factories are part of a larger effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States, a move that experts and government leaders have said is critical to national security.\n\nThe company has received $2.2 billion of its $7.865 billion in funding as part of the federal CHIPS Incentives Program. At least $1.5 billion of that funding was set to go toward the New Albany project, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. An agreement between Intel and the Ohio Department of Development offered the company $300 million in grants to help with the construction of each factory, as long as they were completed by the end of 2028.\n\nDan Tierney, a spokesman for Gov. Mike DeWine called the latest delay a \"disappointment\" but said Intel continues to \"show commitment to the project.\"\n\nCompletion by 2028 was one benchmark, but the performance-based incentives are tied to multiple other benchmarks, Tierney said.\n\n\"Obviously, we'd like to have the plants open earlier rather than later,\" Tierney said. \"But we have every indication from Intel that they will open these plants in Ohio and that this is part of their long term strategy and on-shoring is part of their long term business plan.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Jon Husted, who as the former lieutenant governor worked with DeWine to bring the project to Ohio, said Ohio's chip plants need to become a reality to ensure semiconductors are made in America. Even with the delays, Husted said he believes the factories will still happen.\n\n\"The market and geopolitical events can always impact the timing,\" Husted said. \"But with over $6 billion already invested in this site, it's going to happen.\"\n\nJobsOhio, the state's private nonprofit development corporation, echoed the confidence from the governor's office that Intel's project would move forward.\n\nJust as Intel is committed to Ohio, the state is committed to being a flexible partner with the chipmaker, said Matt Englehart, a spokesperson for JobsOhio. Making sure Intel's Ohio factories come to fruition is \"essential to American national economic security and national defense,\" Englehart said.\n\n\"Although Intel\u2019s timeline has moved to address market realities, the commitment to creating at least 3,000 jobs and $20 billion in capital investment while continuing construction of its most advanced chip production fabs on Earth in Ohio remains unchanged,\" he said.\n\nConstruction at the factory site will not pause but will continue at a slower pace in the next few years. Intel has the ability to speed up work if demand increases, according to the company.\n\nAt its peak, Intel was set to have has many as 7,000 construction workers on site. While it's unclear what the latest delay means for those potential construction jobs, there's plenty of other work available on other projects in central Ohio right now, said Dorsey Hager, executive secretary-treasurer of the Columbus and Central Ohio Building and Construction Trades Council.\n\nHager said Columbus-area builders remain committed to bringing Intel's factories to fruition. Whenever Intel is \"ready to step on the gas,\" Hager said builders will be ready to ramp up as well.\n\n\"Delays happen in construction projects,\" Hager said. \"We're going to work with them together on this to make sure we get this done safely, in a timely manner and under budget.\"\n\nIntel has already started hiring Ohioans and training them at pre-existing company facilities in Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon. And local colleges and school districts have begun retooling programs and training students to join the workforce the company will need when its factories open.\n\nIn 2022, Intel said it would give $17.7 million over three years to fund research and training at more than 80 Ohio colleges and universities developing semiconductor education and workforce programs.\n\nOne Columbus CEO Kenny McDonald told The Dispatch he's not worried about the latest delay and how it could impact such training and research.\n\nIntel's investment in local education, McDonald said, is part of a \"long view\" of how the company is helping to reshape central Ohio. He said he hopes local colleges and schools persist in their programs through Intel's delays.\n\n\"I can't encourage them to stay the course enough,\" McDonald said. \"The reason we've kept our foot on the pedal is we believe this is going to be an incredible opportunity.\"\n\nThe project's initial announcement led to massive upheavals in Licking County with land values skyrocketing around the project site near Johnstown. Leaders in that community also undertook a large planning effort for how Intel would change the area with more residents and businesses. Additionally, the state invested millions to improve roads in the area to help traffic get to and around the site.\n\nThe delays are the latest in a long line of issues Intel has faced since it announced in 2022 that it was coming to Ohio.\n\nYear over year, Intel's annual revenue was down 2% at the end of 2024, compared to the end of 2023, according to the company's financial reports. In August, Intel cut 15,000 jobs \u2014 or about 15% of its workforce \u2014 as part of a $10 billion global restructuring designed to boost profit and improve efficiency.\n\nIntel's stumbles caused its stock to plummet 57% in 2024, despite vast growth in the semiconductor industry, according to the financial service Nasdaq. Intel's stock plunged from $50.25 a share near the end of 2023 to a low of $18.89 in September, before rebounding somewhat this month to $27.39 following comments from Vice President JD Vance about U.S. chip manufacturing.\n\nIn December, shareholders filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California against 13 current and former Intel executives, accusing them of violating federal law by allowing the company to make misleading financial statements.\n\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger abruptly stepped down Dec. 1. The company named then-Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner and senior executive Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Intel has spent $3.7 billion since it broke ground in September 2022. Construction workers have poured more than 200,000 cubic yards of concrete and more than 20 cranes are currently operating at the factory site, where the basement of at least one fab is already finished.\n\n\"Projects of this scale and complexity always come with twists and turns along the way,\" Chandrasekaran wrote. \"[B]ut the end state is one we will all be proud of for decades to come.\"\n\nUSA TODAY Ohio Bureau reporter Laura Bischoff contributed to this story.\n\nmfilby@dispatch.com\n\n@MaxFilby",

Mike DeWine and Intel announced the construction of a new \u201cmega-fab\u201d chip factory in January 2022, calling it the largest economic investment by a single company in state history.\n\nThe semiconductor manufacturer originally estimated its first factory would come online in 2025. Then, it bumped the grand opening to 2027. Now, Intel estimates operations will begin at the Ohio One campus somewhere between 2030 and 2031.\n\nIts second \u201cfab\u201d plant at the site is slated to be finished in 2031 and operational in 2032.\n\n\u201cIn no way does this diminish our long-term commitment to Ohio,\u201d Intel Executive Vice President Intel Naga Chandrasekaran wrote in a statement. \u201cWe have already started hiring Ohioans who are training at our fabs in Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon...Intel is proud to call Ohio home, and we remain excited about our future here.\u201d\n\nBut the silicon chip manufacturer struggled in 2024.\n\nRevenues declined for most of the year, according to quarterly financial reports. Its stock price plummeted by 60%. In August, Intel announced it was laying off 15,000 employees as it laid the ground work for saving $10 billion in 2025. And the company is still searching for a new CEO after the resignation of Pat Gelsinger.\n\n\u201cThe new CEO could decide the strategy of fabricating our designs ourselves might have made long-term sense but it\u2019s eating money like crazy and we just can\u2019t afford it,\u201d said Ned Hill, an emeritus professor of economic development at Ohio State University. \u201cThe question for Intel is do they have products in line for that plant that could make them some money.\u201d\n\nA new partnership?\n\nIf Intel ultimately decides to get out of the foundry business, both Pearl and Hill said selling or partnering with a company like TSMC, a semiconductor manufacturer based in Taiwan, would make sense.\n\n\u201cThe critical point is: The risk of us having a $2 billion hole in the ground in New Albany is very small,\u201d Hill said.\n\nTruckers have already delivered more than 30 \u201csuperloads\u201d of materials and equipment to site.\n\n\u201cIf for some reason Intel has to dump those assets to put money into their balance sheets, some company will be picking up a brand new, state of the art facility,\u201d Hill said.\n\nPearl, couldn\u2019t speak to the specifics at the New Albany site, but he\u2019s heard talk of a deal with TSMC.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a good possibility it could open as a joint venture,\u201d said Pearl, a former National Security Council adviser. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen, well, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a lot of growth in (Intel\u2019s) foundry business. In that case, I think there\u2019s a lot of questions about whether it will open at all.\u201d\n\nBoth the Biden and Trump administrations have pushed for more chip production in the U.S. because they don\u2019t want to rely on foreign countries for critical technology.\n\nAnd the Ohio One campus is positioned near Wright Patterson Airforce Base and the Marysville Honda plant.\n\n\u201cWe need to build chips in America, and this site is going to be instrumental to the Made in America strategy,\u201d Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted said in a statement. \u201cThe market and geopolitical events can always impact the timing, but with over $6 billion already invested in this site, it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nWhen Husted was part of the DeWine administration, he helped craft a $2 billion package of incentives for Intel. The deal included about $1.3 billion in direct cash incentives and 30-year job-creation tax credits worth $650 million.\n\nThe chipmaker also received about $8 billion in incentives from the federal government via the CHIPS Act.\n\n\u201cWhile we are disappointed the plants will not open sooner, construction continues at the Ohio Intel site,\u201d DeWine spokesman Dan Tierney said. \u201cThe company has continued to tell us the fabs will be completed and produce chips. This is a construction delay. The project is moving forward.\u201d\n\nIn exchange for all that money, Intel promised 3,000 jobs, though the U.S. Department of Commerce revised that down to 1,500 late last year.\n\nA spokesperson for Ohio\u2019s Department of Development told Cleveland.com that large-scale projects are \u201cinherently complex\u201d but \u201cas the agreement stands, Intel is still expected to meet its investment, job, and payroll commitments by 2028, and that has not changed.\u201d\n\nThe department didn\u2019t explain how Intel could meet those commitments by 2028 if the plant isn\u2019t completed until 2030.\n\nIf another company bought the Ohio location, that could mean another round of negotiations. And a potential claw back of the money Intel has received.\n\nWhen asked for his prediction for the future of Intel\u2019s Ohio One operation, Hill said, \u201cYou can end your story quite accurately by saying to be continued.\u201d\n\nAnna Staver covers state government and politics for Cleveland.com/The Plain Dealer.",

Last year, Intel delayed the expected construction completion date to 2026.\n\n\u201cMost of all, we are appreciative of all of you and the work you are doing to build this site. Projects of this scale and complexity always come with twists and turns along the way, but the end state is one we will all be proud of for decades to come,\u201d Chandrasekaran said.\n\nThe vendor is using federal funds as part of buildouts of previously announced chip manufacturing and advanced packaging plants in Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon, which are also backed by more than $100 billion in investments by the company.\n\nMultiple news reports have cast doubt on the Trump administration continuing Biden\u2019s Chips Act in its current form, and Trump\u2019s plan to enact tariffs to encourage semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. could cause further disruption for the market.\n\nIntel\u2019s latest quarterly earnings report in January beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations for fourth-quarter 2024 revenue, but the semiconductor giant warned that sales could plummet by as much as 18 percent in this year\u2019s first quarter due to a few major factors, including economic uncertainty and competition from other companies.\n\nDuring the call, Intel interim co-CEO, Executive Vice President and CFO Dave Zinsner said that the company\u2019s leadership \u201cwill be meeting fairly regularly with the Trump administration officials to go make their goals a reality for the U.S.\u201d",

Cramer said that data centers have been a key story in the stock market for months but now it\u2019s losing steam due to a variety of factors. He also mentioned the weakening economic indicators.\n\n\u201cI know these tariffs have people on edge. Consumer confidence indicators have just plummeted.

The first quarter is historically not a great quarter for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC); it will not be a great quarter. But I think they\u2019re trying to stabilize the ship by talking about how they have enough cash to be able to get through. There was no Messianic message about Intel. Don\u2019t expect the stock to go up, but perhaps the trajectory will not be just straight.\u201d\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) latest results have increased fears the company will need a lot of time before seeing any kind of significant improvement. In the first quarter, the company sees revenue of $12.2 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, reflecting an 11-18% decline quarter-over-quarter. The company has also scrapped its plans to launch Falcon Shores, its next-generation AI GPUs. A few months back it was a key catalyst expected to debut in late 2025. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) Clearwater Forest AI data center server CPUs, which were set to use its 18A chip (similar to TSMC\u2019s 3nm nodes), have had their launch delayed from FY2025 to FY2026. These setbacks are likely to affect Intel\u2019s already struggling Data Center & AI business segment. Consensus expectations suggest the company won\u2019t see positive free cash flow for at least the next three years.",

TSMC is the world's leading manufacturer of high-performance semiconductors and has been eyed as a potential buyer for Intel's struggling chip fabrication unit. Intel's fab business has been racking up massive losses and missing key performance milestones, but it still represents an important national resource for the U.S.\n\nOptimistic investors were apparently betting that a deal could move forward in the not-too-distant future and unlock value for Intel shareholders.\n\nBut Intel lost its gains as the market turned bearish on Nvidia\n\nBut then other emotions caught up with investors. Nvidia reported its fourth-quarter earnings results last evening, posting earnings per share of $0.89 on revenue of $39.33 billion -- beating the average analyst estimate's call for per-share earnings of $0.84 on sales of $38.05 billion. The artificial intelligence (AI) giant also guided for sales of $43 billion in the current quarter, beating the previous consensus estimate for sales of $41.78 billion.\n\nBut despite the strong Q4 numbers and guidance, investors turned bearish on Nvidia due to valuation concerns. The bearish sentiment permeated throughout the market and is driving a wave of sell-offs that are having a pronounced impact on tech-sector valuations. That seems to be what caught Intel today.",

But Wittich claims that a shift is now happening.\n\n\"I think we're really kind of in third wave of telco computing,\" he said. \"If you go back pre-virtual network functions, you had your big appliances, and that was the first wave, then you had the introduction of SDN, NFV, and telcos were trying to commoditize the compute and use white-box solutions.\"\n\n\"Frankly, there's a lot of Intel white-box solutions that people are using. They certainly have dominant share there,\" Wittich said, but added \"I don't think that Intel is in as strong of a position today as they were ten years ago to address this market. There's a potentially large shift in the underlying architecture away from x86 at the same time, because you need a lot of performance in a low-power environment. It's kind of a perfect time for Arm-based processors to go and take hold in the telco space.\"\n\nThe company is positioning its Altra processors for the telco space, but Wittich said Ampere has continued to optimize its CPU cores to improve inference performance in the newer AmpereOne family, while the next-gen AmpereOne Aurora with up to 512 cores, announced last year, will be \"heavily AI-focused, but it's AI inferencing.\"\n\nLike Arm, Ampere expects inferencing will be ubiquitous, and so \"inference demand is going to go up significantly over the next couple of years, and it represents an insane amount of compute across the market,\" according to Wittich.\n\n\"So we're trying to solve that scale-out problem for inference. So if we can bring down the power of inference, bring down the cost of inference, that's going to solve what I think is really going to be the biggest, most pressing problem for the next couple of years.\" \u00ae",

            "content": "A federal judge ruled Thursday that the Trump administration can go ahead with plans to fire dozens of officers from the CIA and other intelligence agencies who had temporary jobs working on diversity programs.\n\nU.S. District Judge Anthony Trenga said if fairness and morals were the standard on which he had to rule, he might have delivered a different decision. But the law dictates otherwise, he said.\n\n\u201cThey had the misfortune of being last assigned to a DEI program,\u201d he said, calling it a \u201cdifficult situation.\u201d\n\nThe ruling could open the way to wider firings at the CIA and across the intelligence community as the Trump administration presses ahead with plans to slash the federal workforce and the size of the federal government. At least 51 CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence officers now face imminent dismissal, according to Kevin Carroll, the lawyer representing some of the officers.\n\nThe judge had previously put the imminent firing of the intelligence officers on hold to hear arguments for and against the move. The lawsuit was brought by 17 CIA officers and two employees with the ODNI, including the former head of the office overseeing all diversity, equity and inclusion efforts across all intelligence agencies, according to Carroll. At least 22 other officers were due to be fired for the same reason but were not part of the lawsuit.\n\nAt the hearing in Alexandria, Virginia, Trenga walked through the case step by step, and said the plaintiffs did not make a strong enough argument on the merits for any of the issues in the case.\n\nCarroll argued that if CIA Director John Ratcliffe\u2019s declaration that he can remove any individuals at the agency under the auspices of \u201cnational interest\u201d was taken to its logical end, \u201che could fire all Blacks, all Jews, all gays.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe does not have that authority,\u201d one of the government\u2019s lawyers immediately shot back.\n\nTen of the plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit, along with several of their family members, attended the proceedings. Afterward, several of them told the government\u2019s attorneys that they should be ashamed of themselves. \u201cThat was sick,\u201d one man said to one of the government\u2019s lawyers. \u201cYou are really disgusting,\u201d another said.\n\nCarroll told reporters after the hearing that he respects the court\u2019s decision and will be considering next steps with his clients. He said he was feeling good about something the judge suggested to the government\u2019s lawyers \u2014 that they allow the intelligence officers to apply for other jobs at the CIA.\n\nThe officers\u2019 legal challenge argued that they should be reassigned to other jobs under the intelligence community\u2019s regulations as there was no evidence they had spilled secrets to foreign powers or engaged in any misconduct.\n\nAt a hearing Monday, the judge had asked the administration to provide more information to clarify why the career intelligence officers were not reassigned to new positions instead of being fired.\n\nIn a new brief filed Wednesday, the government submitted a declaration by Ratcliffe saying he had made the decision to terminate all intelligence officers working in the diversity and inclusion office because he determined it was \u201cin the interests of the United States.\u201d The declaration cited federal law that gives intelligence directors wide authority to dismiss employees if national interests are at stake.\n\nBut the plaintiffs had argued that Ratcliffe\u2019s declaration was a post-hoc justification after the termination decision was made and that it failed to adhere to precedent set out in a Supreme Court case in the 1980s. Carroll argued that the high court had ruled in that case that a CIA director could exercise sweeping authority over personnel only on a case-by-case basis, weighing the security risks posed by an individual officer but not an entire group of employees.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s past ruling \u201cdid not envisage mass firings of 51 or more officers on the basis of a domestic political issue: specifically that they carried out the orders of the previous president by implementing congressionally-mandated and funded programs in support of the civil rights statutes,\u201d Carroll said in a written brief to the court.",

            "content": "Intel initially detailed Advanced Performance Extensions (APX) back in mid-2023 as extensions to double the number of general purpose registers and add other performance features. In the time since they have done a lot preparing the GCC and LLVM/Clang compilers for the new APX ISA features while finally today they sent out an initial set of patches for preparing the Linux kernel for APX processors.Intel doesn't intend for Advanced Performance Extensions to be used in kernel-mode but rather just user-space applications. However, the Linux kernel needs to make accommodations around Advanced Performance Extensions for the new register state managed by the XSAVE instruction set, adjusting the XSAVE buffer offset, and ensuring all kernel assumptions are safe/relevant in an APX world.A set of patches from Intel engineers today establish a \"request for comments\" baseline on Linux kernel support for Advanced Performance Extensions. The patches make kernel adjustments to the XSTATE code, go ahead in enabling APX support, and dropping MPX support as it collides with APX. Finishing up the Linux kernel removal of the Intel Memory Protection Extensions (MPX) support is needed since the new XSTATE component for APX is used in the position previously used by MPX - thus a fundamental conflict between MPX and APX although no processor exists that would support both features.\n\nThis RFC patch series is what lays out that initial APX enablement by the Linux kernel. As it's in an RFC state, it may still take some time before the design elements are all settled down and ultimately upstreamed.I don't believe I've seen Intel publicly indicate what generation of processors will first feature APX. However, given that we are only seeing these kernel-side APX patches now and it will be some months before the patches are all worked through and upstreamed, and potentially a couple extra months before it's in turn with a stable kernel and beginning to appear in prominent Linux distributions, this is still a significant affair. As we already know for example that Diamond Rapids will have AVX10.2/512 support and compiler patches have made known ISA capabilities already for both Diamond Rapids and Clearwater Forest, given all things considered we're likely not going to see APX support until after that \"Xeon 7\" generation. So perhaps for \"Xeon 8\" is where APX will make its debut.From these APX enablement patches for the Linux kernel further pointing to APX not coming with Granite Rapids or Clearwater Forest is that it notes testing was done just on an \"internal Intel emulator.\" With Intel confirming in the recent Xeon 6500P and 6700P announcement that Clearwater Forest is already operational and fully functional, plus the fact of seeing Intel engineers bringing up Granite Rapids and Clearwater Forest hardware testing in other patches, the fact they are still relying on a simulator/emulator for APX testing punts its debut out past that point.",

            "content": "Last week at the IEEE International Solid State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), two of the biggest rivals in advanced chipmaking, Intel and TSMC, detailed the capabilities of the key memory circuits, SRAM, built using their newest technologies, Intel 18a and TSMC N2. Chipmakers\u2019 ability to keep scaling down circuits has slowed over the years\u2014but it\u2019s been particularly difficult to shrink SRAM, which is made up of large arrays of memory cells and supporting circuits.\n\nThe two companies\u2019 most densely packed SRAM block provides 38.1 megabits per square millimeter, using a memory cell that\u2019s 0.021 square micrometers. That density amounts to as much as a 23 percent boost for Intel and a 12 percent improvement for TSMC. Somewhat surprisingly, that same morning Synopsys unveiled an SRAM design that achieved the same density using the previous generation of transistors, but it operated at less than half the speed.\n\nThe Intel and TSMC technologies are the two companies\u2019 first use of a new transistor architecture, called nanosheets. (Samsung transitioned to nanosheets a generation earlier.) In previous generations, current flows through the transistor via a fin-shaped channel region. The design means that increasing the current a transistor can drive\u2014so that circuits can operate faster or involve longer interconnects\u2014requires adding more fins to the device. Nanosheet devices do away with the fins, exchanging them for a stack of silicon ribbons. Importantly, the width of those nanosheets is adjustable from device to device, so current can be increased in a more flexible fashion.\n\n\u201cNanosheets seem to allow SRAM to scale better than in other generations,\u201d says Jim Handy, chief analyst at memory consulting firm Objective Analysis.\n\nFlexible Transistors Make Smaller, Better SRAM\n\nAn SRAM cell stores a bit in a six-transistor circuit. But the transistors are not identical, because they have different demands on them. In a FinFET-based cell, this can mean building two pairs of the devices with two fins each and the remaining two transistors with one fin each.\n\nNanosheet devices provide \u201cmore flexibility on the size of the SRAM cell,\u201d says Tsung-Yung Jonathan Chang, a senior director at TSMC and an IEEE Fellow. There is less unintended variation among transistorswith nanosheets, he says, a quality that improves SRAM\u2019s low-voltage performance.\n\nEngineers from both companies took advantage of nanosheet transistors\u2019 flexibility. For the previously twin-finned devices, called the pull-down and pass-gate transistors, nanosheet devices could be physically narrower than the two separate fins they replaced. But because the stack of nanosheets has more silicon area in total, it can drive more current. For Intel that meant up to a 23 percent reduction in cell area.\n\n\u201cTypically, the bit line has been stuck at 256 bits for a while. For N2\u2026we can extend that to 512. It improves the density by close to 10 percent.\u201d \u2014Tsung-Yung Jonathan Chang, TSMC\n\nIntel detailed two versions of the memory circuit, a high-density and a high-current version, and the latter took even more advantage of nanosheet flexibility. In FinFET designs, the pass-gate and pull-down transistors have the same number of fins, but nanosheets allow Intel to make the pull-down transistors wider than the pass-gate devices, leading to a lower minimum operating voltage.\n\nIn addition to nanosheet transistors, Intel 18a is also the first technology to include backside power delivery networks. Until 18a, both power-delivery interconnects, which are typically thick, and signal-carrying interconnects, which are finer, were built above the silicon. Backside power moves the power interconnects beneath the silicon where they can be larger and less resistant, powering circuits through vertical connections that come up through the silicon. The scheme also frees up space for signal interconnects.\n\nWith FinFET devices, an SRAM\u2019s pass gate (PG) and pull down (PD) transistors need to drive more current than other transistors, so they are made with two fins. With nanosheet transistors, SRAM can have a more flexible design. In Intel\u2019s high-current design, the PG device is wider than others, but the PD transistor is even wider than that to drive more current. Intel\n\nHowever, backside power is no help in shrinking the SRAM bit cell itself, Xiaofei Wang, technology lead and manager at Intel, told engineers at ISSCC. In fact, using backside power within the cell would expand its area by 10 percent, he said. So instead, Intel\u2019s team restricted it to peripheral circuits and to the perimeter of the bit cell array. In the former, it helped shrink circuits, because engineers were able to build a key capacitor beneath the SRAM cells.\n\nTSMC is not yet moving to backside power. But it was able to extract useful circuit-level improvements from nanosheet transistors alone. Because of the transistor flexibility, TSMC engineers were able to extend the length of the bit line, the connection through which cells are written to and read. A longer bit line links more SRAM cells and means the memory needs fewer peripheral circuits, shrinking the overall area.\n\n\u201cTypically, the bit line has been stuck at 256 bits for a while,\u201d says Chang. \u201cFor N2\u2026we can extend that to 512. It improves the density by close to 10 percent.\u201d\n\nSynopsys Squeezes SRAM Circuits\n\nSynopsys, which sells electronics design-automation tools and circuit designs that engineers purchase and integrate into their systems, reached roughly the same density as TSMC and Intel but using today\u2019s most advanced FinFET technology, 3 nanometer. The company\u2019s density gain came mainly from the peripheral circuits that control the SRAM array itself, specifically what\u2019s called an interface dual-rail architecture combined with an extended-range level shifter.\n\nTo save power, particularly in mobile processors, designers have begun to drive the SRAM array and the peripheral circuits at different voltages, explainsRahul Thukral, senior director of product management at Synopsys. Called dual rail, it means that the periphery can operate at a low voltage when needed while the SRAM bit cells run at a higher voltage, making it less likely they will lose their bits.\n\nBut that means the voltages representing the 1s and 0s in the SRAM cells don\u2019t match the voltages in the periphery. So, designers incorporate circuits called level shifters to compensate.\n\nThe new Synopsys SRAM improves the memory\u2019s density by placing the level shifter circuits at the interface with the periphery instead of deep within the cell array and by making the circuits smaller. What the company is calling \u201cextended range level shifters\u201d integrate more functions into the circuit while using FinFETs with fewer fins, leading to a more compact SRAM overall.\n\nBut the density isn\u2019t the only point in its favor, according to Thukral. \u201cIt allows the two rails to be very much further apart,\u201d he says, referring to the bit cell voltage and the periphery voltage. The voltage at the bit cells can run between 540 millivolts and 1.4 volts while the voltage at the periphery can go as low as 380 mV. That voltage difference allows the SRAM to perform well while minimizing power, he says. \u201cWhen you bring it down to really, really low voltages\u2026it brings power down by a lot, which is what today\u2019s AI world loves,\u201d he says.\n\nAsked if a similar circuit design might work to shrink SRAM in the future nanosheet technologies, Thukral said: \u201cThe answer is 100 percent yes.\u201d\n\nAlthough, Synopsys managed to match TSMC and Intel on density, its offering operated much more slowly. The Synopsys SRAM\u2019s maximum was 2.3 gigahertz compared to 4.2 GHz for the fastest version of TSMC\u2019s SRAM and 5.6 GHz for Intel\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impressive Synopsys can reach the same density on 3 nm, and it\u2019s at a frequency that will be relevant for the mass market silicon for that node in the long term,\u201d says Ian Cutress, chief analyst at More Than Moore. \u201cIt also showcases how process nodes are rarely static, and new, dense designs for things like SRAM are still occurring.\u201d",

While Intel claims the new chips are faster than their predecessors by 14% - 54%, depending on the workload, the relatively low core count and frequency pretty much limit usage of Intel's Xeon 6500/6700 processors to applications that do not benefit from the extreme core count of 128 per socket and do not need maximum per-core performance.\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\nArguably, Intel does it to ensure that its most expensive Xeon 6900P-series processors remain CPUs of choice for performance-demanding workloads. Nonetheless, if a company wants to build an 8-way machine with the maximum possible number of cores (688), it will have to choose a Xeon 6700P CPU.\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\nOne of the interesting features of Intel's Xeon 6500 and Xeon 6700-series processors is support of the Intel TDX Connect technology that enables encrypted connection between the CPU and PCIe devices with direct memory access and lower overhead, which allows transferring confidential data to be processed on the GPU, which will be useful for various workloads, including AI.\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\nSince Intel's Xeon 6500/6700-series processors feature a lower number of cores, they use fewer Granite Rapids compute chiplets: one (for SKUs with up to 48 cores) or two (for up to 86-core models). Also, the new CPUs use a smaller LGA4710-2 packaging and are compatible with Intel's Socket E2, so they are not compatible with platforms for Intel's Xeon 6700E and 6900P.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

            "content": "For operators, Xeon 6 with performance cores supports vRAN acceleration and edge AI use cases\n\nAs Intel goes through a leadership transition and rumors of a potential split between the foundry and products businesses make the rounds, the company made a major step in developing its AI data center offerings with the release of the Xeon 6 series of CPUs with performance cores (P-cores). The company\u2019s Interim co-CEO and CEO of Intel Products Michelle Johnston Holthaus said in a statement that the Xeon 6 series \u201cdelivers the industry\u2019s best CPU for AI and groundbreaking features for networking, while simultaneously driving efficiency and bringing down the total cost of ownership.\u201d\n\nThe Xeon 6 series comes in two models, the 6700 and 6500, and brings a 1.4x performance improvement compared to its predecessor, according to Intel. The company highlighted the applicability of Xeon 6 as a \u201cfoundational\u201d CPU for AI systems, \u201cpairing exceptionally well with a GPU as a host node CPU.\u201d Specific to use in a virtualized radio access network (vRAN), Intel has integrated acceleration (vRAN Boost is the branding) for compute-intensive workloads into the system-on-chip. The latest CPUs \u201cdeliver up to 2.4x the RAN capacity and a 70% improvement in performance-per-watt compared to previous generations.\u201d\n\nIn its announcement of Xeon 6, Intel spotlighted work it has done with major network equipment providers Ericsson, HPE and Samsung, and AT&T, Verizon and Vodafone, operators all committed to Open RAN. Ericsson has ported its Cloud RAN software to Xeon 6 and the two firms \u201care amplifying their collaboration to bring Intel Xeon 6-based Cloud RAN solutions to market.\u201d\n\nHPE and Intel are partnered on \u201cdriving the advancement of [vRAN] with integrated platforms\u2026In 2025, the companies will continue their collaboration to grow telco edge and Open RAN based on Intel Xeon 6 SoCs.\u201d\n\nSamsung has also integrated its own vRAN software with Intel\u2019s Xeon 6 to \u201cenable operators to dramatically improve [TCO] by consolidating RAN workloads from multiple servers to just a single server.\u201d The companies are working on AI-enabled use cases for the RAN, including \u201cenhanced energy efficiency, traffic steering and improved spectral efficiency.\u201d\n\nOn the operator side, Intel\u2019s launch came with commentary from AT&T, Verizon and Vodafone, all operators who have embraced multi-vendor Open RAN architectures. AT&T\u2019s Rob Soni, vice president of RAN technology, called out work with Ericsson and Intel \u201cto build the world\u2019s most open, programmable and reliable RAN network.\u201d He said AT&T would start deploying Xeon 6 this year.\n\nVerizon, which this week announced the deployment of an Open RAN RIC using a Qualcomm platform to host a Samsung energy management app, is \u201cworking with Intel to develop the next-gen high-compute-density vRAN server\u2026that doubles our RAN compute capacity and enables greater energy efficiency, multitenancy and a lower [TCO],\u201d SVP of Global Networks and Technology Adam Koeppe said in a statement. He also noted that more than 40% of Verizon\u2019s 5G RAN footprint is virtualized, \u201cin addition to our entire 5G core and edge.\u201d\n\nVodafone Head of Open RAN Paco Martin referenced Voda\u2019s UK network as demonstrating \u201cthat open and virtualized networks built on Intel Xeon can compete with advanced legacy radio access networks. We look forward to continuing our close collaboration with Intel.\u201d\n\nHolthaus spoke at length about Xeon and the AI data center opportunity during Intel\u2019s most recent earnings call. She said 2025 \u201cis all about improving Xeon\u2019s competitive position as we fight harder to close the gap to competition\u2026The world\u2019s data center workloads still primarily run on Intel silicon, and we have a strong ecosystem, especially within enterprise. We\u2019re going to leverage these strengths as we work to stabilize our market share in 2025.\u201d\n\nAI data centers, she continued, represent \u201can attractive market for us over time, but I am not happy with where we are today. On the one hand, we have a leading position as the host CPU for AI servers. And we continue to see a significant opportunity for CPU-based inference on-prem and at the edge as AI-infused applications proliferate.\u201d Edge inference is a hot topic in the larger AI discourse given the cost, performance and scalability benefits that come with localized inference, including on-device, on enterprise premises and at the edge of cellular networks.\n\nImportant to note that this latest round of Xeon 6 sports the P-cores; a related Xeon 6 launch last year focused on SoCs with efficiency cores (E-cores). The latter debuted in June last year and ahead of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next week, Intel gave an update on how Xeon 6 processors with E-cores have supported 5G core network deployments.\n\nIntel\u2019s Alex Quach, vice president and general manager of the Wireline and Core Network Division, said \u201cinfrastructure efficiency, power savings and uncompromised performance are essential criteria for\u201d operators. He specifically noted how Intel Infrastructure Power Manager software \u201cis showing tremendous progress in reducing server power in [operator] environments on existing and new infrastructure.\u201d",

            "content": "Chip giant Intel (INTC 0.65%) has tried and failed to break into the lucrative AI accelerator market that's dominated by Nvidia. The company's Gaudi family of AI accelerators had potential, and Intel priced them aggressively, but sales were snarled by an immature software ecosystem. Intel missed its own AI chip sales estimates for 2024, and it recently shifted gears. Falcon Shores, originally a follow-up to Gaudi 3, is cancelled as a commercial product, and Intel is now focusing on rack-scale AI solutions that likely won't be ready until 2026.\n\nWhile Intel is effectively a non-factor in the AI accelerator market, the company's CPU business could pick up some of the slack. As the AI industry matures and workloads shift from training AI models to running those models, Intel's Xeon server CPUs are a potent weapon in the AI wars.\n\nCheap AI could work in Intel's favor\n\nThe recent revelation that Chinese start-up DeepSeek managed to train an AI model that compares favorably with the best models from U.S. companies while costing far less to train and run could ultimately work in Intel's favor. While training advanced AI models requires powerful accelerators like those from Nvidia, that's not necessarily the case for inference, or actually running those models. Smaller, less capable AI models can already be run effectively on CPUs, particularly CPUs that have some AI acceleration capabilities built in.\n\nIntel announced new members of its Xeon 6 family of server CPUs on Monday, extending the lineup to cover lower price points and specialized use cases. The Xeon 6500 and 6700 series chips are aimed at data centers. These server CPUs are far more efficient and denser than Intel's previous-generation chips, and the company claims that customers can achieve up to 68% lower cost of ownership compared to 5-year-old systems. While these chips can be paired with AI accelerators as part of an AI training cluster, Intel also noted that they deliver up to 50% greater AI inference performance compared to the most recent server CPUs from rival AMD.\n\nIntel also launched its Xeon 6 for network and edge chips, which target radio access network and other edge computing applications. These chips are up to 70% more power efficient than their predecessors, and they pack an AI punch as well. Intel noted that a 38-core video edge server system is capable of running AI inference on 38 simultaneous camera streams.\n\nNot every AI use case requires the most advanced AI model trained on all the world's data. As more capable AI is crammed into smaller, cheaper models, CPUs with built-in AI acceleration can be an important piece of any company's AI strategy.\n\nA big market up for grabs\n\nAs the AI industry matures, the initial mad dash to deploy AI solutions will give way to serious discussions about returns on investment. Intel's attempt to focus on cost efficiency with its AI accelerators fell flat due to software issues, but a similar strategy could work with its CPUs.\n\nFor applications involving small, fine-tuned AI models capable of being run without pricey AI accelerators, servers full of Intel's latest Xeon 6 CPUs could be the most cost-effective solution. In other cases where AI accelerators are necessary, Intel's CPUs can still be part of the equation.\n\nIDC estimates that total annual spending on machine learning and analytics will reach $361 billion by 2027, with $153 billion of that total coming from generative AI spending. As capable AI models become cheaper to run and more efficient, a growing share of this spending could go to infrastructure without high-end AI accelerators.\n\nBeing shut out of the AI accelerator market, Intel's overall AI opportunity is smaller than it would have otherwise been if the company had managed to turn Gaudi into a success. But even with that setback, Intel still has a horse in the AI race.",

(Intel Corporation/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo)\n\nBy Stephen Nellis | REUTERS\n\nIntel on Monday said that the first two cutting-edge lithography machines from ASML Holding are \u201cin production\u201d at its factories, with early data indicating they are more reliable than earlier models.\n\nAt a conference in San Jose, California, Intel senior principal engineer Steve Carson said Intel has produced 30,000 wafers, the large discs of silicon that can yield thousands of computing chips, in a single quarter with ASML\u2019s high numerical aperture (NA) lithography machines.\n\nIntel last year was the world\u2019s first chipmaker to take delivery of the machines, which are expected to produce smaller and faster computing chips than earlier ASML machines. The move was a shift in strategy for Intel, which lagged rivals in adopting the previous generation of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines.\n\nIt took Intel seven years to put those earlier machines into full production, which contributed to it losing its lead to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel struggled with the reliability of those previous EUV models in the initial stages of production.\n\nHowever, Carson said ASML\u2019s new high NA machines are about twice as reliable as the earlier generation in initial testing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting wafers out at a consistent rate, and that\u2019s a huge boon to the platform,\u201d Carson said.\n\nThe new ASML machines, which print features onto chips using beams of light, can also do the same work as earlier machines using fewer exposures, saving time and money.\n\nCarson said early results at Intel\u2019s factories showed that the high NA machines can do what took earlier machines three exposures and about 40 processing steps with just one exposure and a \u201csingle digit\u201d number of processing steps.\n\nIntel has said it plans to use the high NA machines to help develop what it calls its 18A manufacturing technology, which is scheduled for mass production with a new generation of PC chip later this year.\n\nIt has said it plans to put the high NA machines into full production with its next generation of manufacturing technology called 14A, but has not given a mass production date for that technology.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Jose, California; Editing by Leslie Adler and Sam Holmes",

Recently, Intel\u2019s potential sale of its chip manufacturing business to TSMC and Broadcom has captured global attention, illustrating the magnitude of change underway in this critical sector.\n\nKey Things to Know: Intel's Potential Semiconductor Shake-Up: Intel is reportedly considering selling its chip manufacturing business to TSMC and Broadcom, a move that could reshape the semiconductor industry.\n\nMarket Consolidation & Competition Risks: The acquisition could further cement TSMC\u2019s dominance, raising concerns over supply chain security and reduced competition in the semiconductor sector.\n\nGeopolitical & National Security Implications: The U.S. government is scrutinising the deal due to concerns about foreign control over critical semiconductor infrastructure, particularly in light of the CHIPS Act.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s Expansion into AI & Data Centres: By acquiring Intel\u2019s chip design unit, Broadcom could strengthen its position in AI, high-performance computing, and cloud infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat challenges do chipmakers face in an industry defined by rapid market fluctuations and astronomical research costs? How might the sale of Intel\u2019s manufacturing and design businesses impact competition and technological innovation? And most importantly, what does this shift mean for the future of semiconductor manufacturing on a global scale?\n\nThe Complex Landscape of Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing has undergone a remarkable evolution since the development of the first integrated circuits. Over the years, the industry has witnessed numerous breakthroughs, with each advancement paving the way for more complex and powerful devices.\n\nThe early days of semiconductor manufacturing were marked by small-scale production processes, with individual companies handling their own manufacturing needs. However, as the industry grew and became more complex, the need for specialised facilities and expertise became apparent. This led to the establishment of semiconductor foundries, which offer contract manufacturing services to a wide range of clients.\n\nThe Cost Challenges of Semiconductor Fabrication\n\nFoundries provide access to advanced equipment, trained personnel, and research facilities, allowing manufacturers to focus on design and product development while leaving the manufacturing process to the experts. Today, foundries are a crucial component of the semiconductor industry, with many companies relying on them for the bulk of their manufacturing needs.\n\nHowever, foundries are not without their faults nor challenges, with the most significant challenge faced by semiconductor manufacturers being the high cost associated with cutting-edge facilities. The development and maintenance of advanced manufacturing facilities require substantial investments, with costs running into billions of dollars. The construction of a new facility can take years, with numerous delays and setbacks along the way. Once operational, the facility must be continuously updated with the latest equipment and technologies to remain competitive.\n\nTechnical Challenges in Chip Miniaturisation\n\nAs technology advances, the size of features on chips continues to shrink, making them increasingly difficult to produce. The transition from 20nm to 10nm and beyond has presented numerous technical challenges, with manufacturers struggling to achieve the desired level of precision and accuracy. The introduction of new materials and manufacturing techniques has helped to address some of these challenges, but the limitations of current technology have made it difficult to scale down chip size further.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is known for its rapid market changes, with demand for certain products and technologies shifting almost overnight. The challenge of keeping up with such demand fluctuations while maintaining production capacity is a daunting task for manufacturers. The impact of global supply chains on delivery schedules is another critical factor that manufacturers must consider. Disruptions in supply chains can lead to delays in production, resulting in missed delivery deadlines and lost revenue.\n\nProcess Nodes and Their Impact on Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nMaking matters worse, companies such as Intel have traditionally tied their products to specific process nodes, with each node representing a specific level of technological advancement. This tight integration of technology advancements with process nodes has led to potential setbacks for manufacturers as the failure to achieve desired results at a specific node can result in costly delays and setbacks, making it challenging for manufacturers to stay on schedule.\n\nThe semiconductor industry operates in a fast-paced environment, with a continuous need for research and innovation to stay ahead of the curve. The pressure to innovate while managing costs and operational efficiencies is a significant challenge that manufacturers face on a daily basis. The need to balance short-term goals with long-term vision is a delicate balancing act that requires careful planning and execution. Manufacturers that fail to adapt to changing market demands and technological advancements risk falling behind their competitors, making innovation a critical component of survival in the semiconductor industry.\n\nIntel Exploring Sale of Chip Manufacturing Business to TSMC and Broadcom\n\nIn a move that could reshape the semiconductor industry, Intel is reportedly considering the sale of its chip manufacturing business to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Broadcom. According to sources, TSMC is in talks with Intel to acquire its manufacturing facilities, while Broadcom is eyeING the company's chip design business.\n\nIndustry analysts suggest that such a deal could accelerate semiconductor industry consolidation, potentially leading to increased dependence on a smaller number of key players. As TSMC and Broadcom expand their foothold, concerns over supply chain resilience and market competition may prompt further scrutiny from regulatory authorities across the U.S. and Europe.\n\nIntel\u2019s Declining Market Position and Competitive Challenges\n\nThe development comes as Intel's fortunes have been in decline over the past few years. The chipmaker's market value has plummeted, and it has undergone significant restructuring efforts, including the termination of its former CEO, Pat Geling, and the layoff of thousands of employees. Despite this, Intel has managed to maintain its position as a major player in the industry, with a focus on innovation and research.\n\nDespite these restructuring efforts, Intel continues to face mounting competition from fabless chipmakers such as Nvidia and AMD, both of which have leveraged TSMC\u2019s advanced manufacturing processes to deliver cutting-edge semiconductor solutions. This shift raises questions about whether Intel\u2019s pivot towards chip design alone will be sufficient to maintain long-term market relevance.\n\nGeopolitical Concerns and Government Involvement\n\nIntel's interim executive chairman, Frank Yerary, is leading the discussions with potential suitors, including TSMC and Broadcom. The Trump administration is also involved in the talks, with officials expressing concerns about the fate of a critical national security company. Intel was set to benefit from the US CHIPS Act under the previous Biden administration, but the company did not receive the necessary funding before the administration changed.\n\nThe potential sale of Intel\u2019s manufacturing arm to TSMC has raised national security concerns in Washington, with policymakers wary of increasing foreign control over critical semiconductor infrastructure. Given the U.S. government\u2019s push to revitalise domestic chip production through the CHIPS Act, regulators may impose additional conditions on any deal to ensure continued investment in American semiconductor capabilities.\n\nThe potential sale of Intel's manufacturing business to TSMC would be a significant development in the semiconductor industry. TSMC is already a major player in the field, with a strong reputation for producing high-quality chips. If the sale were to go through, it would likely have a major impact on the industry, with potential implications for competition and market share.\n\nTSMC\u2019s Growing Dominance in Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nA successful acquisition could reshape the global semiconductor landscape, cementing TSMC\u2019s dominance as the industry\u2019s go-to manufacturer. However, such consolidation may also introduce new risks, including increased supply chain vulnerabilities and potential price fluctuations due to reduced competition in high-end chip fabrication.\n\nThe sale of Intel's chip design business to Broadcom would also be a significant move. Broadcom is a well-established company with a strong track record in the semiconductor industry. The acquisition of Intel's chip design capabilities would give Broadcom a major boost, allowing it to expand its product offerings and increase its market share.\n\nWith this acquisition, Broadcom is expected to leverage Intel\u2019s chip design expertise to strengthen its position in data centre and AI-driven semiconductor markets. The company\u2019s focus on networking and high-performance computing could benefit from Intel\u2019s legacy in x86 architecture, potentially leading to new advancements in cloud computing and AI acceleration hardware.\n\nReimagining Roles and Shaping Tomorrow's Semiconductor Industry\n\nThe semiconductor industry stands on a knife edge in its history, with the sale of Intel's manufacturing business to TSMCs and Broadcom. The shift from early, integrated circuit production to the current model of highly specialised foundries reflects the increasing complexity of the manufacturing process, but this sale could threaten this very model that has otherwise proven to be massively successful.\n\nAs we move forward, several key trends will undoubtedly shape the semiconductor industry's future. The rise of foundry dominance is likely to continue, with TSMCs and Samsung solidifying their positions as industry leaders, with this consolidation allowing foundries to operate more efficiently, but it also raises the risk of monopolisation and the potential loss of competition in the industry. The dependency of global semiconductor supply on a limited number of foundry companies may create new geopolitical and supply chain challenges, particularly as nations strive to secure their own semiconductor sovereignty.\n\nGeopolitical Influence on Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nGeopolitics and supply chains will also play a significant role in the industry's future. The semiconductor industry has become a critical area of focus for governments around the world, with the U.S. and EU investing heavily in domestic semiconductor production capabilities. The CHIP Act in the U.S., for example, aims to reduce the country's reliance on Asian foundries and promote domestic production for national security and economic purposes. If Intel's manufacturing business is sold to TSMC, it could prompt further government intervention to ensure that domestic production remains viable.\n\nThe role of artificial intelligence (AI) and new materials will also become increasingly important in the industry's future development. As transistors approach their physical limits, alternative approaches such as advanced packaging techniques, new materials like gallium nitride (GaAs) and silicon carbide, and AI-driven chip design will be essential for continued innovation. AI is expected to play a key role in streamlining research and development processes, enabling more rapid innovation cycles and more efficient manufacturing processes.\n\nAI and New Materials Driving Future Innovation\n\nThe end of Moore's Law, which has driven the semiconductor industry's growth for decades, is also a significant trend that will shape the industry's future. While the industry has traditionally relied on transistor shrinkage to achieve performance gains, it is now shifting focus to architectural innovations such as 3D chiplets, heterogeneous integration, and advanced packaging techniques. This shift allows the industry to continue progressing, even as physical limits are approached, while the exploration of new materials and technologies, such as quantum computing, can help to achieve further performance gains.\n\nThe reshaping of industry leadership is another key trend that will impact the semiconductor industry's future development. If Intel exits the chip manufacturing business, it will likely become a more agile and innovative company focused on design and software solutions, similar to AMD. TSMC and Broadcom, on the other hand, will solidify their positions as industry leaders, shaping the future of semiconductor manufacturing. New entrants may also emerge, particularly those with specialised chip designs that leverage the latest technologies and innovations. The acquisition of Intel's design business by Broadcom could lead to a new era of competition in the industry, driving innovation and product differentiation.\n\nOverall, the semiconductor industry is at a critical juncture, with several key trends shaping its future development. The rise of foundries, geopolitical considerations, the role of AI and new materials, the end of Moore's Law and the shift to new technologies, and the reshaping of industry leadership will all play important roles in determining the industry's future trajectory. Companies that can adapt to these trends and navigate the complexities of the industry will be well-positioned for success in the years to come.",

            "content": "Top spy Gabbard says she fired 100+ intel officers for 'really horrific' chat messages\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Senate confirms Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence Former House Democrat and Army veteran turned Trump ally Tulsi Gabbard has been confirmed as the director of national intelligence.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Tulsi Gabbard, the new director of National Intelligence, said she has fired more than 100 U.S. intelligence officers from various agencies \u2013 and revoked their security clearances \u2013 for having what she said were improper and sexually explicit conversations in internal government chat rooms.\n\nThe chat rooms were run by the ultra-secret National Security Agency (NSA) through its multi-agency Intelink platform to allow the nation\u2019s spies and intel analysts to internally discuss a broad array of topics, including those involving diversity, equity and inclusion issues \u2212 and gender-affirming surgeries, according to a report Monday by conservative activist and journalist Christopher Rufo in City Journal.\n\nGabbard announced the firings in a Tuesday night appearance on Fox News but did not say what the employees discussed in what appeared to be private employee support groups, or why it constituted grounds for dismissal. She said the employees were using the chatrooms inappropriately to talk about \"really, really horrific behavior.\"\n\n\"There were over 100 people from across the intelligence community that contributed to and participated in this \u2013 what is really just an egregious violation of trust, basic rules and standards around professionalism,\" Gabbard said. \u201cI put out a directive today that they all will be terminated and their security clearances will be revoked.\u201d\n\nAn ODNI spokesperson had no immediate comment Wednesday about whether the employees were given the specific reasons for their dismissal, including whether they violated guidelines for what could be discussed in the private chat rooms. In his article, Rufo quoted an unidentified NSA press official saying, \"All NSA employees sign agreements stating that publishing non-mission related material on Intelink is a usage violation and will result in disciplinary action.\"\n\nGabbard, a former Democratic House member from Hawaii who joined the Republican party in 2024, thanked Rufo \"for putting it all out online.\" A day earlier, he published a report about \"the NSA's Secret Sex Chats,\" with purported chat logs showing participants engaging in \"wide-ranging discussions of sex, kink, polyamory, and castration.\"\n\n\u201cOne popular chat topic\" was gender-affirming surgery, Rufo reported, using outdated terminology. Rufo included chat logs with purported conversations among employees in which they detailed their sex lives after transitioning, as well as \"hair removal, estrogen injections, and the experience of sexual pleasure post-castration.\"\n\nHe said some of the conversations were held within LGBTQ+ employee resource groups and meetings with titles such as \"Privilege,\" \"Ally Awareness,\" \"Pride,\" and \"Transgender Community Inclusion.\"\n\nIn an official post on @X, the National Security Agency said it was aware of posts \"that appear to show inappropriate discussions by IC personnel.\"\n\nWhile the agency did not elaborate on specifics, it said, \"Potential misuse of these platforms by a small group of individuals does not represent the community. Investigations to address this misuse of government systems are ongoing.\"\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, which oversees the nation\u2019s 18 intelligence agencies, has sent a memo directing them to identify all employees who participated in the NSA's \"obscene, pornographic, and sexually explicit\" chatrooms by Friday, according to DNI spokesperson Alexa Henning.\n\nGabbard: The latest of many 'violations of the American people's trust'\n\nGabbard was confirmed on Feb. 12 after facing one of the toughest confirmation battles among Trump\u2019s appointees. She suggested in her Fox News interview that the chatrooms were part of a larger problem in which U.S. intelligence agencies had operated without the proper oversight through at least several of the previous Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\nPeople said during her Fox interview the people fired for inappropriate posts \"were brazen in doing this because when was the last time anyone was really held accountable?\"\n\n\"Certainly not over the last four years, certainly not over the last 10, maybe 20 years when we look at some of the biggest violations of the American people's trust in the intelligence community.\"\n\nGabbard described the firings as the first step in a Trump administration campaign to \"clean house, root out that rot and corruption, and weaponization and politicization, so we can start to rebuild that trust in these institutions.\"\n\nShe said the ODNI and other intelligence agencies were receiving tips about those issues from \"people (who) are stepping forward because they are all on board with the mission to clean house and refocus on our core mission of serving the American people.\"\n\nIn an unrelated matter, both the ODNI and the CIA have moved to fire an undisclosed number of employees as part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to rid the government of DEI initiatives. Some of these workers sued on the grounds that their dismissals violated federal workforce laws against discrimination.\n\n\"None of these officers\u2019 activities was or is illegal, and at no time have the agencies employing Plaintiffs contended that they individually engaged in any misconduct, nor are they accused of poor performance,\" the officers said in their complaint against Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.\n\nA federal judge in Washington, D.C. paused the firings of 11 CIA officers on Feb. 18 until he could review the matter. A ruling in that case could come as early as Thursday.\n\nImmediately upon taking office last month, President Donald Trump also signed an executive order revoking the security clearances of 50 former intelligence officials, most of whom Republicans have accused of coordinating with Joe Biden's 2020 White House campaign to discredit reporting on Hunter Biden's emails in the closing weeks of the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nAll but one of the former intelligence officials signed a 2020 letter that said the public release of emails that reportedly belonged to Hunter Biden had \"all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\"\n\nThe letter signers Trump targeted included former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, an intelligence official who worked for Republican and Democratic administrations; former CIA Director Michael Hayden, who led the department under former President George W. Bush; his successor in Barack Obama's administration, Leon Panetta; and John Brennan, who held the role for much of Obama's second term.\n\nJosh Meyer is USA TODAY's Domestic Security Correspondent.

            "content": "Intel stock has soared of late, and the question is whether it can continue.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of President Donald Trump's campaign was a promise to bring more manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. from overseas. In particular, the new administration has been focused on bolstering domestic technology innovation as the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution intensifies.\n\nBy now, it's clear that semiconductors are among the most important pieces of the AI puzzle. Suppliers such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom have been leading the charge for high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) and networking equipment for data centers. However, these companies rely heavily on foundry solutions from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\n\nOver the last few years, Taiwan Semi has emerged as the leading player in the foundry realm, acquiring over 60% market share. As American competitors, particularly Intel (INTC 0.65%), continue to lag behind Taiwan Semi, it begs the question of what steps the U.S. chipmaker could take.\n\nBelow, I'll explore what could jump-start Intel's business in an increasingly competitive AI environment and assess whether the stock is a good opportunity right now.\n\nWhy Intel is the chip stock to watch now\n\nEarlier this month, Vice President JD Vance attended an AI summit in Paris with other world leaders and high-profile technology moguls. At the event, French President Emmanuel Macron asked Vance to share some thoughts on AI as it pertains to regulations, safety, economic impact, job creation, and more.\n\nThe vice president was quite clear on his administration's vision for the future of AI. He echoed the words of President Trump, stating that this administration is focused on a \"pro-worker growth path\" to help create more jobs in the AI industry. He went on to call America the leader in AI development and said that this administration \"plans to keep it that way.\"\n\nWhile the vice president's words could simply be surface-level commentary, I can't help but think he might be hinting at something potentially larger.\n\nTalking the talk and walking the walk?\n\nJust days after Vance's speech at the Paris summit, the rumor mill started swirling around (wait for it!)...Intel. According to Baird research analyst Tristan Gerra, the U.S. Government could be working on a deal that involves Intel and Taiwan Semi forming a joint venture. The thought is that Intel would partner with TSMC in an effort to bring more advanced engineering capabilities to its foundry division.\n\nIn theory, a deal like this could completely reinvent Intel. The company has fallen so far behind Taiwan Semi that it's hard to imagine how it could realistically catch up in the chip manufacturing market. With all this said, there are some more important details to analyze before pouring into Intel stock.\n\nIs Intel stock a good buy right now?\n\nAs of this writing, Intel stock has gained 30% in 2025 -- trouncing the returns generated by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Interestingly, the entirety of Intel's gains this year took place right after Feb. 10. This is the time during which VP Vance attended the AI summit and subsequent rumors of an Intel-TSMC joint venture popped up.\n\n\n\nI'll admit that I find the idea of an alliance between Intel and TSMC quite intriguing. But with that said, it is still just a rumor. Moreover, a multitude of media outlets have been publishing different opinions on a potential deal and how the current administration might view it.\n\nI believe Intel's stock has already appreciated considerably, purely based on the narrative that it finally unlocked a way to jump-start its chip manufacturing capabilities. While I do think a joint venture of some sort could be transformative for Intel, investors should understand that these deals are complex and take time to bear fruit -- if they happen at all.\n\nFor now, I'm cautiously optimistic about Intel, but its incredible stock return in 2025 appears to be driven by an exciting narrative and not tied to the fundamentals of the underlying business. For these reasons, I would not chase the momentum right now.",

Chief among these is a deal that would see Intel's manufacturing arm spun off into a separate entity overseen by the world's leading fabricator, Taiwan Semiconductor.\n\nHowever, today, the Taiwanese economy minister told reporters that he had not received any information about a deal. TSMC would need approval from his office to move forward.\n\nThe news calls into question how real the rumored deal is, sending shares lower.\n\nChip controls\n\nThe uncertainty that the Taiwanese economy minister's comments brought came as the Trump administration reiterated its intention to further restrict chip exports to China.

            "content": "Intel has started using two leading-edge ASML High-NA Twinscan EXE:5000 EUV lithography tools, the company revealed on Monday at an industry conference, Reuters reports. The company uses these systems for research and development purposes, and so far, Intel has processed tens of thousands of wafers using them.\n\nIntel installed and started using two High-NA EUV lithography tools from ASML at its D1 development fab near Hillsboro, Oregon, last year and has now processed as many as 30,000 wafers using these systems, Intel engineer Steve Carson revealed at the SPIE Advanced Lithography + Patterning conference. Intel was the first leading chipmaker to get High-NA EUV machines (which are believed to cost \u20ac350 million each) last year and plans to use them to produce its 14A (1.4nm-class) chips several years down the road.\n\nAdopting an all-new manufacturing tool ahead of competitors is important, as it enables Intel to develop various High-NA EUV manufacturing aspects (such as glass for photomasks, pellicles for photomasks, chemicals, etc.) that could eventually become industry standards. Also, ASML is poised to develop its Twinscan EXE:5000 High-NA EUV tools with feedback provided by engineers from Intel, which could give the American giant an edge over competitors over time.\n\nProcessing 30,000 wafers in a quarter is far below what commercial-grade systems can do. However, the number is massive for R&D usage, demonstrating how serious Intel is about becoming the leading chip maker in the High-NA EUV era.\n\nAlthough ASML considers its Twinscan EXE:5000 High-NA EUV lithography tools to be pre-production tools not designed for high-volume manufacturing, Intel has reportedly said these systems are \u201cmore reliable than earlier models.\u201d Still, the report does not elaborate on whether ASML\u2019s Twinscan EXE:5000 is more reliable than the company\u2019s pre-production Twinscan NXE:3300 tool from 2013, which was used to develop the existing EUV ecosystem, or the production-grade Twinscan NXE:3600D or NXE:3800E that are used for high-volume manufacturing (HVM) today. Considering that ASML uses similar light sources for NXE and EXE machines, they may indeed be very reliable.\n\nASML\u2019s Twinscan EXE High-NA EUV lithography tools can achieve a resolution of down to 8nm with a single exposure, a substantial improvement compared to Low-NA EUV systems that offer 13.5nm resolution with a single exposure. While current-generation Low-NA EUV tools can still achieve an 8nm resolution with double patterning, this lengthens the product cycle and can affect yields. High-NA EUV tools reduce the exposure field by half compared to Low-NA EUV systems, which require chip developers to alter their designs. Given the costs and peculiarities of High-NA EUV litho systems, all chipmakers have different strategies for their adoption. Intel clearly wants to be the first adopter, whereas TSMC is a little more cautious.",

How struggling chipmaker's financial issues may impact Ohio factories\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Drone footage shows New Albany Intel plant construction progress Drone footage in New Albany, Ohio shows the progress Intel has made on its Ohio One plant, two years after the groundbreaking in September 2022.\n\nConcerns are growing among local leaders and stakeholders about the future of Intel's Ohio project.\n\nFinancial struggles, including declining revenue and a 57% drop in stock price, have plagued Intel in recent months.\n\nIntel has fallen behind competitors in the semiconductor industry, particularly in AI technology.\n\nThis was supposed to be Intel's year.\n\nIn 2025, semiconductors were to begin rolling off production lines at the company's first Ohio factory, which was hailed as a multibillion dollar employment and economic boon for the region.\n\nBut delays, financial struggles and a leadership shakeup have plagued the chipmaker in the years since Intel announced it was coming to Ohio.\n\nNow, the first of Intel's two fabs isn't expected to open until at least 2027 or 2028. And, when the factories finally do open, its unclear whether they'll be making chips for American-based Intel or another company entirely.\n\n\"It's more than just noise,\" said Zach Schiller, research director at Policy Matters Ohio, a left-leaning think tank with offices in Columbus and Cleveland. \"They're a troubled company at the moment \u2014which none of us want to see\u2014 but that seems pretty evident and it's been true for some time.\"\n\nRead More: How does nearly $1B Anduril project compare to Intel, Honda and other recent Ohio wins?\n\nFor most of 2024, Intel's revenue declined, according to quarterly financial reports issued by the company.\n\nAfter a 9% increase in revenue in the first three months of 2024 compared with 2023, Intel's revenue declined by 1% in the second quarter of last year, by 6% in the third quarter and by 7% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Year over year, Intel's annual revenue was down 2% at the end of 2024 compared to the end of 2023, according to the company's financial reports.\n\nDespite the financial issues, an Intel spokesperson told The Dispatch the company is moving ahead with its Ohio fabs.\n\n\"Intel is committed to building two leading-edge fabs in Ohio, and we continue to advance both fabs,\" a spokesperson said via email. \"We will align the start of production at each fab with market demand over the coming years.\"\n\nBut as Intel's issues continue to pile up, they've resulted in real drawbacks for the chipmaker.\n\nIn August, Intel cut 15,000 jobs \u2014or about 15% of its workforce\u2014 as part of a $10 billion global restructuring designed to boost profit and improve efficiency.\n\nLike Schiller, Greg Lawson, research fellow at right-leaning think tank The Buckeye Institute, said he's worried about how Intel's issues may impact Ohio's fabs.\n\nLawson believes Ohio's chip factories will be completed given the national security interest in having semiconductors made stateside. But, Lawson said he's concerned Intel may not live up to its promised job creation despite the amount of taxpayer dollars that were spent to attract the company here.\n\n\"You can't look at the headlines and not have concerns,\" he said. \"I think we put an awful lot on the table... You need to have easily enforceable claw backs because what happens in 10 years? Is whoever is in the governor's mansion then really going to do that?\"\n\nIntel's stumbles caused its stock to plummet 57% in 2024, despite vast growth in the semiconductor industry, according to the financial service Nasdaq. Intel's stock plunged from $50.25 a share near the end of 2023 to a low of $18.89 in September 2024 before rebounding somewhat this month to $27.39 following comments from Vice President J.D. Vance about U.S. chip manufacturing.\n\nIn December, shareholders filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California against 13 current and former Intel executives, accusing them of violating federal law by allowing the company to make misleading financial statements.\n\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger abruptly stepped down Dec. 1. The company named then-Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner and senior executive Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs.\n\nAlthough Intel's issues have left some local leaders concerned, Licking County Commissioner Tim Bubb said he remains optimistic despite what he described as \"unsettling\" developments.\n\n\"We're painfully aware,\" Bubb said of Intel's financial problems. \"Intel obviously has internal problems, capital problems and leadership problems... We're observing from the sidelines, but we've got some real skin in the game here.\"\n\nAlthough local leaders have maintained what Bubb described as a good relationship with Intel throughout the company's ups and downs, he said it's difficult not knowing what may happen.\n\nIntel has already poured more than 200,000 cubic yards of concrete and more than 20 cranes are currently operating at the site, where the basement of at least one fab is already finished.\n\nWhile Intel is deep into its work on its first two Ohio factories, Schiller said it's clear only one will be done come 2028. If that pans out, Schiller said the Ohio Department of Development should make sure it enforces its agreement with the company, which states $300 million in grants are available to help with the construction of each factory completed by the end of 2028.\n\n\"Ohio\u2019s stance has not changed,\" said Dan Tierney, spokesman for Gov. Mike DeWine. \"The project is moving forward, and the lion\u2019s share of incentives are performance based, meaning the company does not receive the incentive until benchmarks are met.\"\n\nIn preparation for Intel, local governments have poured money into improving infrastructure around the factory site. At the same time, schools and universities have begun revamping programs to better train the workforce Intel will need in New Albany.\n\nBetween all of that work and the ongoing construction of the company's fabs, Bubb said he thinks Intel is too far along to turn back now. But, he questioned whether the scope of the economic development Intel initially promised Ohio would actually pan out in the end.\n\n\"When it was announced, Intel was the grand slam that just sort of came out of the clouds,\" Bubb said. \" Now it's not certain when and if Intel is going to be hiring that workforce...All I'm doing is reinterring the same questions everyone else is asking.\"\n\nIntel's problems have even galvanized a coalition called Chips Communities United to pressure the company to make good on its investments after receiving $7.86 billion in funding from the federal CHIPS and Science Act. Intel received the most funding of any semiconductor company from the law and planned to make investments not just in Ohio but also in New Mexico, Arizona and Oregon.\n\nOfficials should also require Intel to annually report the number of jobs its Ohio plants have created along with other metrics such as capital invested, said both Schiller and Bailey Sandin, work and wages fellow at Policy Matters Ohio.\n\n\"This isn't just a central Ohio issue,\" said Sandin, who is also part of Chips Communities United. \"This is something that's going to impact the entire state and it could easily get left behind if the necessary precautions aren't taken.\"\n\nFurther complicating Intel's fiscal problems is the fact that it has fallen behind its closest competitors. Chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., NVIDIA, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. have all pulled ahead of Intel, which largely exited the smartphone market years ago, said Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint, a Hong Kong-based technology market research firm.\n\nAt the same time, Intel has also lagged competitors when it comes to artificial intelligence, said Jeongku Choi, senior analyst at Counterpoint.\n\nWhile investing in new leading-edge fabs in Ohio could help Intel rebound, Choi said the company still has a lot of catching up to do. And as demand for chips in AI and data centers picks up, Choi and Wang said Intel will struggle to compete for now.\n\n\"Intel is really behind its competitors in the GenAI chip market...Manufacturing technology has to improve,\" Wang told The Dispatch. \"Investing in leading edge fabs is a no-brainer to survive. It\u2018s the only way to regain the confidence of their customers.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, some of the companies Intel has failed to keep up with have gone so far as to express interest in buying part or most of the company.\n\nBroadcom is eyeing Intel's chip design and marketing business while TSMC \u2014the world's biggest contract chipmaker\u2014 has looked at possibly controlling some or all of Intel's chip plants, the Wall Street Journal reported in early February. President Donald Trump has also asked TSMC to consider taking a controlling interest in Intel, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nSan Diego-based Qualcomm has also considered buying Intel, Reuters reported in September. And rumors have swirled about whether Elon Musk, the world's richest man and leader of Tesla and SpaceX might be interested in buying Intel.\n\nWhile a potential merger or purchase could complicate Intel's future, Bubb said it could be just what the company needs. If the right company buys Intel, it could get the chipmaker on the proper financial footing and position Ohio's fabs to make the most technologically advanced semiconductors in the world.\n\n\"The question really gets to be: who will operate them?\" Bubb said. \"Maybe, it will be a company that is more in the game. Maybe it has to happen...Potentially, it's a positive.\"\n\nmfilby@dispatch.com\n\n@MaxFilby",

The Xeon 6 family marked the first time the company bifurcated its server CPUs between two performance types: the traditional P-cores for a broad swath of data center applications and E-cores for cloud-native and telecom workloads.\n\nThe chips have been viewed as Intel\u2019s response to the high-density, energy-efficient custom Arm-based processors that are allowing Intel\u2019s largest cloud customers\u2014Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud\u2014to lower their reliance on the company.\n\nDespite the product segment not meeting expectations so far, Holthaus indicated Intel still has high hopes for its next-generation Xeon CPUs with E-cores, code-named Clearwater Forest, even though the company had to delay their release to the first half of 2026 from the original 2025 timeframe it had given.\n\nClearwater Forest has been seen as a strategically important product in large part because of how it will be the first server CPU to use the Intel 18A node, which the company has repeatedly said will allow it to surpass the advanced chip-making capabilities of TSMC and Samsung. Several months before Gelsinger abruptly left the company as CEO, he said the product would allow Intel to \u201caccelerate share gains.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does have some complicated packaging expectations that moved it to 2026, but we expect that to be a good product and continue to close the gap as well. But this is going to be a journey. It\u2019s not a destination,\u201d Holthaus said on the earnings call.",

            "content": "This Intel Xeon 6 series has been a launch we have been waiting on for around three quarters. Today, we have the launch of the Intel Xeon 6700P and Xeon 6500P series. These are the smaller Socket E2 (LGA4710-2) processors compared to the big socket Intel Xeon 6900P series. At the same time, they are not necessarily \u201clower-end\u201d as they can scale to 4 sockets, eight sockets and beyond. What is more, we will show you perhaps one of the coolest capabilities we previewed in September 2024, called the \u201cR1S,\u201d which is the single-socket mode with 136 PCIe Gen5 lanes. We have a lot to get into in this one.\n\nThe Intel Xeon 6700P R1S is a Winner\n\nUsually, we first go into the cores, speeds, feeds, and so forth. Realistically, this is a Granite Rapids P-core CPU that we have seen in the 6900P series with similar feature sets with a slightly smaller platform. We will start our regular discussion on page 2, but I wanted to get to perhaps the most significant new feature and platform. The big winner from this series might be the least expected. Intel has a new mode that trades UPI links for PCIe Gen5 links, similar to what AMD does with its Infinity Fabric links on EPYC. The net result is a 136 PCIe Gen5 single-socket platform that should make the storage industry and many others drool.\n\nIntel is starting to take 1S seriously with lower-priced single-socket SKUs. Like the other Intel Xeon 6700P SKUs, we get 8-channel DDR5 support, and the higher-end single-socket SKUs support MCRDIMMs/ \u201cMRDIMMs\u201d. Intel is also giving access to its onboard accelerators like QAT by default, which is great.\n\nIntel is repurposing UPI links for PCIe Gen5 links. In this single-socket motherboard block diagram, we can see that UPI0 and UPI1 lanes are being used instead of UPI.\n\nHere is a quick look at the Intel Xeon 6781P in the Supermicro server with the motherboard above. The two NUMA nodes are a choice, as this can also be set as a single NUMA domain. Two compute tiles make it easy to partition the chip into two NUMA nodes.\n\nIntel\u2019s parts seem to have L3 cache defined at the tile level, rather than simply by the number of cores, meaning that the ratio can shift depending on the core count. In the 80-core part with 336MB of L3 cache, Intel has 4.2MB of L3 cache and 2MB of L2 cache per core. In the 2021-2023 top-bin Intel Xeon Platinum 8380, there was only 60MB of L3 cache in total. Intel has the same exact core count as two Platinum 8380\u2019s, but with around 2.8x the L3 cache and 2x the L2 cache. Intel has largely closed the cache gap with AMD.\n\nWhen I first saw this. I was excited. We are using a 1U Supermicro server, which probably does not fully do the R1S platform justice. Here we have eight (up to 12) NVMe SSDs up front and up to three x16 devices in the rear. If you use new 122.88TB SSDs, like the Solidigm D5-P5336 122.88TB NVMe SSD you can easily fit over 1PB of storage per U while still having enough PCIe lanes for internal M.2 SSDs, and PCIe Gen5 x16 400Gbps NICs in the rear.\n\nScaling this up to 2U, we could use 24x U.2 122.88TB drives for 3PB (1.5PB/1U), which is only 96 lanes. That still leaves 40 PCIe Gen5 lanes for other components. That is two 400GbE NICs plus eight lanes for boot drives, lower-performance NICs, and other hardware. While we only get eight memory channels, oftentimes in storage platforms costs are reduced through using fewer DIMMs. Here, at least in the higher-end CPUs, one can use MCRDIMMs/ MRDIMMs to get more memory bandwidth from fewer DIMMs.\n\nFrom a competitive standpoint, AMD does not have a direct competitor. The 12-channel EPYC 9000 series platforms do not have as many PCIe Gen5 lanes (128) but do have 8 lower-speed PCIe Gen3 lanes in single-socket servers. Still, this is the first time in a long time that Intel had an outright, albeit slight, win in a single-socket PCIe category. Beyond that, AMD has the EPYC 8004 series, a smaller socketed processor but with older Zen 4c cores and fewer PCIe lanes and memory channels. I really like the EPYC 8004 series, but Intel now has something firmly between it and the EPYC 9000 series.\n\nOf course, AMD can still win the outright core count battle in single-socket, but most storage servers and many single socket servers simply aim lower in the stack than 100+ core parts. AMD will claim it has more cores, but Intel has a winner with the R1S configurations. From what we understand, the 1P SKUs above are just the ones discounted explicitly for this operation mode, but the ability to toggle the UPI to PCIe is not exclusive to those SKUs.\n\nNext, let us get to the more mainstream parts of the new Xeon 6 CPUs.",

The move was a shift in strategy for Intel, which lagged rivals in adopting the previous generation of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines.\n\nIt took Intel seven years to put those earlier machines into full production, which contributed to it losing its lead to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel struggled with the reliability of those previous EUV models in the initial stages of production.\n\nHowever, Carson said ASML's new high NA machines are about twice as reliable as the earlier generation in initial testing.\n\n\"We're getting wafers out at a consistent rate, and that's a huge boon to the platform,\" Carson said.\n\nThe new ASML machines, which print features onto chips using beams of light, can also do the same work as earlier machines using fewer exposures, saving time and money.\n\nCarson said early results at Intel's factories showed that the high NA machines can do what took earlier machines three exposures and about 40 processing steps with just one exposure and a \"single digit\" number of processing steps.\n\nIntel is using its 18A manufacturing technology, which is scheduled for mass production with a new generation of PC chip later this year, to test the high NA tools.\n\nIt has said it plans to put the high NA machines into full production with its next generation of manufacturing technology called 14A, but has not given a mass production date for that technology.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Jose, California; Editing by Leslie Adler, Sam Holmes and David Gregorio)",

            "content": "Facing stiff competition from its long-time rival AMD and the ever-present specter of custom Arm silicon in the cloud, Intel on Monday emitted another wave of Xeon 6 processors.\n\nHowever, these new P-core Xeons aren't trying to match AMD on core count or raw computational grunt this time. We got those parts, which were primarily aimed at HPC and AI-centric workloads, last fall.\n\nInstead, its 6700P, 6500P, and 6300P-series Granite Rapids Xeons launching today are aimed squarely at the workhorses of the datacenter \u2013 think virtualization boxes, storage arrays, and, of course, big multi-socket database servers.\n\nHaving successfully restored core count parity with its x86 rival, Intel is leaning heavily on what remains of its reputation among customers, its complement of compute accelerators, and more aggressive pricing in a bid to stem its share losses in the datacenter.\n\nScaling Xeon 6 down\n\nPeeling back the integrated heat spreader, we find a now-familiar collection of silicon. With Xeon 6, Intel has fully embraced heterogeneous chiplet architecture splitting of I/O functionality from compute and memory.\n\nAt the top of the stack are the 6900P-series parts we looked at last fall, which feature a trio of compute and memory dies, built on the Intel 3 process node, flanked by a pair of Intel 7-based I/O dies.\n\nWhile all of Intel's Xeon 6 parts largely share the same I/O die, Intel's new 6700P and 6500P Xeons feature different compute tiles ranging from a pair of extreme-core-count dies on the 86-core part or a single high-core-count or low-core-count die for the 48-core and 16-core chips.\n\nHere we see Intel has fully embraced the heterogeneous chiplet architecture pioneered by long-time rival AMD \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nThis gives Intel some flexibility in terms of balancing core count and clock speeds for specific workloads, and, we imagine, helps quite a bit with yields. However, because the memory controller is part of the compute die rather than integrated into the I/O die, this means they're limited to eight memory channels as opposed to the 12 on its flagship parts this generation.\n\nIntel's latest chips make up for this somewhat by including support for two DIMMs per channel configurations \u2013 something notably absent on its earlier Granite Rapids parts. In single-socket configurations, the chips also support up to 136 lanes of PCIe 5.0 connectivity versus 88 on its multi-socket optimized processors.\n\nLess silicon means that this round of Xeon 6 processors run a fair bit cooler and pull less wattage than the 500 W parts we looked at last year coming in between 150 and 350 W depending in large part on core count. This means you can now have up to 22 more cores in the same power footprint as the last generation.\n\nIntel remains committed to multi-socket systems\n\nAs of 2025, Intel remains the only supplier of x86 kit for large multi-socket systems, commonly employed in large, mission-critical database environments. For reference, AMD's Epyc processors have only ever been offered in single or dual socket configurations\n\nFor those running these kinds of large, memory-hungry workloads, like SAP HANA, the release of Intel's 6700P series parts represents a major performance uplift over its aging Sapphire Rapids Xeons.\n\nYep, Intel is still the only x86 vendor offering configurations that scale beyond two sockets \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nHowever, with Compute Express Link (CXL) memory expansion devices eliminating the need for additional CPU sockets to achieve the multi-terabyte memory capacities demanded by these workloads, the question becomes whether these big multi-socket configurations are even necessary.\n\nOne of CXL's key features is the ability to add additional memory capacity to compatible systems via expansion modules that slot into a standard PCIe interface. The extra memory, which, by the way, doesn't have to be DDR5, then appears as another NUMA node.\n\nDespite these advancements, Intel Senior Fellow Ronak Singhal doesn't see demand for four and eight-socket systems going away any time soon. \"When you're looking at the memory expansion, there's a certain amount you can do with CXL, but for the people that are going to four-socket and eight-socket, or even beyond, they want to get those extra cores as well,\" he said.\n\nIntel leans hard on its accelerator investments\n\nCompared to last gen, Intel says its 6700P-series chips will deliver anywhere from 14 to 54 percent higher performance compared to its top-specced fifth-gen Xeons.\n\nHere's how Intel says its latest Xeons stack up against last gen \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nHowever, against its competition, it's clear that Intel is leaning pretty heavily on the integrated accelerator engines baked into its chips to differentiate and give it a leg up.\n\nWhile the rise of generative AI has shifted the definition of accelerators somewhat to mean GPUs or other dedicated AI accelerators, Intel has been building custom accelerators for things like cryptography, security, storage, analytics, networking, and, yes, AI into its chips for years now.\n\nLeaning on its onboard accelerators, Intel says a single Xeon 6 server has the potential to replace up to ten second-gen Xeon boxes \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nAlong with increased core counts and instructions per clock this generation, Intel says its cryptographic engines and advanced matrix extensions (AMX) now mean a single Xeon 6 server can take the place of up to ten Cascade Lake systems, at least for workloads like image classification and Nginx web serving with TLS.\n\nCompared to AMD's latest and greatest fifth-gen Epycs, Intel is claiming a performance advantage of 62 percent for Nginx TLS, 17 percent for MongoDB, 52 percent in HPCG, 43 percent in OpenFOAM, and 2.17x in ResNet-50.\n\nHere's how Intel says its latest Xeons stack up to Epyc. Obviously take these with a grain of salt \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nAs usual, we recommend taking these performance claims with a grain of salt, especially because they are for Intel's flagship 6900P processors and focus on workloads that benefit directly from either its integrated accelerator engines, or early support for speed MRDIMM memory tech.\n\nWith that said, if your workloads can take advantage of these accelerator engines, it may be worth taking a closer look at Intel's Xeon 6 lineup. Speaking of which, here's a full rundown of Intel's 6700P and 6500P series silicon launching today.\n\nIntel Xeon 6 6700P/6500P Performance SKUs\n\nSKU Cores Base clock Boost clock (All core) Boost clock (Max) L3 cache TDP Sockets Mem channels Mem speed DDR5/MRDIMM UPI links PCIe lanes Price 6787P 86 2 GHz 3.2 GHz 3.8 GHz 336 MB 350 W 2 8 6,400/8,000 MT/s 4 88 $10,400 6767P 64 2.4 GHz 3.6 GHz 3.9 GHz 336 MB 350 W 2 8 6,400/8,000 MT/s 4 88 $9,595 6747P 48 2.7 GHz 3.8 GHz 3.9 GHz 288 MB 350 W 2 8 6,400/8,000 MT/s 4 88 $6,497 6745P 32 3.1 GHz 4.1 GHz 4.3 GHz 336 MB 300 W 2 8 6,400/8,000 MT/s 4 88 $5,250 6737P 32 2.9 GHz 4 GHz 4 GHz 192 MB 330 W 2 8 6,400/8,000 MT/s 4 88 $4,995 6736P 36 2 GHz 3.4 GHz 4.1 GHz 144 MB 205 W 2 8 6,400/NA MT/s 4 88 $3,351 6730P 32 2.5 GHz 3.6 GHz 3.8 GHz 144 MB 250 W 2 8 6,400/NA MT/s 4 88 $3,726 6527P 24 3 GHz 4.2 GHz 4.2 GHz 144 MB 255 W 2 8 6,400/NA MT/s 4 88 $2,878 6517P 16 3.2 GHz 4 GHz 4.2 GHz 72 MB 190 W 2 8 6,400/NA MT/s 3 88 $1,195 6507P 8 3.5 GHz 4.3 GHz 4.3 GHz 48 MB 150 W 2 8 6,400/NA MT/s 3 88 $765\n\nIntel Xeon 6 6700P/6500P Mainline SKUs\n\nSKU Cores Base clock Boost clock (All core) Boost clock (Max) L3 Cache TDP Sockets Mem channels Mem speed (DDR5) UPI links PCIe lanes Price 6788P 86 2 GHz 3.2 GHz 3.8 GHz 336 MB 350 W 8 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $19,000 6768P 64 2.4 GHz 3.6 GHz 3.9 GHz 336 MB 330 W 8 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $16,000 6748P 48 2.5 GHz 3.8 GHz 4.1 GHz 192 MB 300 W 8 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $12,702 6738P 32 2.9 GHz 4.1 GHz 4.2 GHz 144 MB 270 W 8 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $6,540 6728P 24 2.7 GHz 3.9 GHz 4.1 GHz 144 MB 210 W 8 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $2,478 6724P 16 3.6 GHz 4.2 GHz 4.3 GHz 72 MB 210 W 8 8 6,400 MT/s 3 88 $3,622 6714P 8 4 GHz 4.3 GHz 4.3 GHz 48 MB 165 W 8 8 6,400 MT/s 3 88 $2,816 6760P 64 2.2 GHz 3.4 GHz 3.8 GHz 288 MB 330 W 2 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $7,803 6740P 48 2.1 GHz 3.3 GHz 3.8 GHz 288 MB 270 W 2 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $4,650 6530P 32 2.3 GHz 3.7 GHz 4.1 GHz 144 MB 225 W 2 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $2,234 6520P 24 2.4 GHz 3.4 GHz 4 GHz 144 MB 210 W 2 8 6,400 MT/s 4 88 $1,295 6515P 16 2.3 GHz 3.8 GHz 3.8 GHz 72 MB 150 W 2 8 6,400 MT/s 3 88 $740 6505P 12 2.2 GHz 3.9 GHz 4.1 GHz 48 MB 150 W 2 8 6,400 MT/s 3 88 $563\n\nIntel Xeon 6 6700P/6500P Single-socket SKUs\n\nSKU Cores Base clock Boost clock (All core) Boost clock (Max) L3 Cache TDP Sockets Mem channels Mem speed (DDR5 / MRDIMM) UPI links PCIe lanes Price 6781P 80 2 GHz 3.2 GHz 3.8 GHz 336 MB 350 W 1 8 6,400/8,000 MT/s 0 136 $8,960 6761P 64 2.5 GHz 3.6 GHz 3.9 GHz 336 MB 350 W 1 8 6,400/8,000 MT/s 0 136 $6,570 6741P 48 2.5 GHz 3.7 GHz 3.8 GHz 288 MB 300 W 1 8 6,400/NA MT/s 0 136 $4,421 6731P 32 2.5 GHz 3.9 GHz 4.1 GHz 144 MB 245 W 1 8 6,400 / NA MT/s 0 136 $2,700 6521P 24 2.6 GHz 4.1 GHz 4.1 GHz 144 MB 225 W 1 8 6,400/NA MT/s 0 136 $1,250 6511P 16 3.2 GHz 4.1 GHz 4.2 GHz 72 MB 150 W 1 8 6,400/NA MT/s 0 136 $815\n\nIntel gets aggressive on pricing\n\nIntel's Xeon 6 6700P and 6500P-series launch sees the x86 giant get considerably more aggressive with regard to pricing.\n\nCore-for-core, Intel has traditionally charged a premium for its chips compared to AMD. Comparing Intel's fourth-gen Xeon launch \u2013 that's Sapphire Rapids if you'd forgotten \u2013 to AMD's fourth-gen Epyc processors, we saw launch price differences ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand depending on the segment.\n\nWith Intel's latest Xeon launch we don't see the same pricing dynamics at play. Looking at launch prices for AMD's fifth-gen Epycs from last fall, it's clear Intel has attempted to match, if not undercut, its smaller competitor on pricing at any given core count or target market.\n\nThe one exception to this is Intel's four and eight-socket compatible chips, which have no competition in the x86 space and so we still see Intel charging a premium here. Need a maxed-out, eight-socket database server? You can expect to pay more than $150,000 ($19,000 a piece) in CPUs alone.\n\nOf course, these are tray prices we're talking about, and so they don't take into account volume discounts offered to customers by either chipmaker. Prices aren't fixed and it's not unusual for them to be revised to account for competitive pressure or market conditions.\n\nWe've already seen Intel slash prices for its flagship 6900P-series Xeons by an average of $4,181 since they were launched in September. And it is easy to see why. AMD was charging nearly $5,000 less for the same number of cores with its fifth-gen Epyc Turin parts. Intel's more aggressive pricing makes its chip more than $500 cheaper.\n\nAnd that's not the end of the story. Short of steep price cuts to the Epyc lineup, Intel's Xeon 6 processors could end up being substantially less expensive than AMD's if a 25-plus-percent tariff on semiconductor imports ends up being implemented by the Trump administration.\n\nIntel's Xeon 6 processors are among the few current-generation products the company is still manufacturing in-house. Assuming it can keep up with US demand at its domestic fabs, Intel Xeons are positioned to sidestep these tariffs. AMD, meanwhile, is reliant on TSMC for manufacturing.\n\nNew entry-level Xeons and SoCs for the edge\n\nAlongside its mainstream 6700P and 6500P processor families, Intel is also rolling out new embedded and entry-level Xeon processors.\n\nAt the bottom of the stack is Intel's 6300-series Xeons, which can be had in four, six, and eight-core flavors with clock speeds up to 5.7 GHz. However, with only two DDR5 memory channels, which max out at 128 GB of capacity and speeds of 4,800 MT/s, these chips are more closely aligned with AMD's baby Epycs we looked at last year than your typical datacenter CPU.\n\nFor embedded, edge, and networking environments, Intel is also rolling out a new Xeon 6 SoC variant, which it's positioning as a successor to its fourth-gen Xeon with vRAN boost.\n\nAlongside its datacenter-focused parts, Intel is rolling out a new edge-optimized SKU with an I/O die tuned for virtualized RAN networks \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nThe chip, which is designed to be integrated directly into edge compute, networking, or security appliances, can be had with up to 42 cores and features a unique I/O die with 200 Gbps of aggregate Ethernet bandwidth, presumably broken out across eight 25GbE links.\n\nAlong with powering things like virtualized radio access network (vRAN) systems, the chips can also be equipped with accelerators for cryptographic acceleration, AI, or media transcoding. The idea being that these chips could also be deployed in security appliances or to preprocess data at the edge.\n\nYou're probably not cool enough for Intel's 288-core monster\n\nIf you're wondering what ever happened to that 288-core E-core Xeon former CEO Pat Gelsinger teased back at Intel Innovation in 2023, it's still lurking in the shadows, Singhal told press ahead of the launch.\n\nBut unlike Intel's earlier Sierra Forest E-core Xeons launched last year, it seems Intel is holding its highest core-count parts in reserve for cloud service providers.\n\n\"The 288-core is now in production. We actually have this deployed now with a large cloud customer,\" Singhal said. \"We're really working on that 288-core processor closely with each of our customers to customize what we're building there for their needs.\"\n\nThis isn't surprising as the part was always designed to serve the cloud and managed service provider market, providing loads of power efficient if not necessarily the most feature-packed or performant cores for serving up microservices, web-scale apps, and other throughput-oriented programs.\n\nWe also know that demand for its E-core parts hasn't lived up to expectations.\n\n\"What we've seen is that's more of a niche market, and we haven't seen volume materialize there as fast as we expected,\" Intel co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus said during the company's Q4 earnings call.\n\nThis ultimately resulted in the delay of Intel's 18A-based Clearwater Forest parts from 2025 to 2026. But as we noted, the timing of that launch was always awkwardly close to Sierra Forest and, in our opinion, left prospective customers in the difficult position of either being an early adopter or waiting a little longer for what's likely to be a far more refined and performant part.\n\nAccording to Singhal, the part is already running in the lab and an Intel customer has powered on its first systems using it. \u00ae",

            "content": "Intel has launched a special website dedicated to its Intel 18A (1.8nm-class) process technology. Launching such a website is uncommon for Intel, especially given that it merely covers the previously-announced milestones, but considering the fact that the company is under severe pressure from investors, market observers, clients, rivals, and even politicians, launching a new website may not be a bad idea after all.\n\nIntel's 18A fabrication technology is the company's first commercial manufacturing process to rely on gate-all-around RibbonFET transistors as well as a backside power delivery network called PowerVia (something that its closest rival TSMC N2 misses). The new production node will also be the company's first leading-edge process technology that is compatible with industry-standard electronic design automation (EDA) tools as well as IPs from third-party providers and will be available for Intel Foundry external customers. The company pins a lot of hope on this process as it is meant to show that Intel can deliver a leading-edge manufacturing process.\n\nThe Intel 18A website indeed points out that the company's 1.8nm-class fabrication technology is not only an Intel development, but a platform that spans across the industry involving EDA tools and IP developers, contract chip designers and design-on-the-cloud providers. The company also reminds that its 18A manufacturing process has been selected by U.S. military and U.S. government for their applications. Considering the fact that Intel only plans to produce its first 18A product \u2014 the Panther Lake processor for client PCs \u2014 in the middle of the year and expects first tape-ins of third-party 18A products around mid-2025, this is so much the company can do in terms of showing endorsement of the new technology by third parties.\n\nWhen Intel's fabrication technologies were years ahead of the industry \u2014 which was just about a decade ago \u2014 Intel would always release details about its next-generation manufacturing technologies together with actual product launches. Just like today, Intel discussed innovative materials and transistor structures in detail, always a source of delight for a technological geek.\n\nTimes have changed though, and many believe that Intel will forever remain behind TSMC with no chance to retake pole position. Intel certainly wants to prove naysayers wrong, which is one of the reasons why it launched its website. Another reason is of course to attract more attention to the fabrication process and therefore products that it will power.",

Meanwhile, internal turmoil \u2013 marked by the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger last December \u2013 has signaled a loss of direction. As a result, the stock has plunged ~43% over the past year.\n\nHowever, more recently the shares have been trimming those losses, gaining ground on account of rumors there might be a savior \u2013 or even saviors \u2013 at the gate.\n\nThe rumor mill has been in full swing with multiple reports about possible partnerships between TSMC and Intel, with the U.S. federal government also involved. Several outlets said discussions were in the early stages with reports suggesting TSMC might take a minority stake in a joint venture and transfer tech to Intel, while others indicated TSMC could acquire a majority stake in some or all of Intel\u2019s manufacturing assets. It\u2019s not only the manufacturing assets that are drawing attention; some reports speculated that Broadcom might be interested in Intel\u2019s design and product assets.\n\nThat said, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore makes the point that none of those involved have commented on these reports. On the other hand, the 5-star analyst notes that TSMC stated in its 2Q24 earnings call that it was not interested in joint ventures in the U.S. and reaffirmed in the 3Q24 earnings call that it had no plans to acquire Intel\u2019s fabs. Furthermore, a Reuters report suggested that the White House probably won\u2019t support foreign ownership of Intel\u2019s manufacturing facilities.\n\n\u201cSo there is quite a bit of uncertainty here, and we would not draw any conclusions about what may happen,\u201d Moore went on to say.\n\nIn any case, Moore says the structure of the deal would be crucial in determining whether the outcome is favorable or unfavorable.\n\n\u201cWe believe the value here is the product business, and we would prefer whatever fab outcome puts the product business into the best position to succeed, whether that is IDM 2.0 (the Gelsinger strategy), IDM 1.0 (essentially the Bob Swan strategy, using the fabs to support the product roadmap and any premium priced nationally sensitive foundry, without trying to compete economically with TSMC) or pure fabless,\u201d Moore opined.\n\nBottom line, the analyst rates Intel shares as an Equal-weight (i.e., Neutral), along with a $25 price target, suggesting the stock is currently fully valued. (To watch Moore\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThe Street\u2019s average target is actually a little lower; at $22.79, the figure factors in a one-year slide of 8%. Most, like Moore, remain on the sidelines for now; based on 27 Holds, 5 Sells and just 1 Buy, the consensus view is that this stock is a Hold.

Before that, he was at Apple where his team designed the A4 and A5 chips used for iPhones and iPads. Keller spent most of his career at AMD designing the company's Zen processors in the 2010s and the Athlon processor in the '90s. He is the current CEO of Tenstorrent, a company developing AI processors.\n\nEarlier in the week, Keller tweeted that the rumor \"fire sale\" for parts of Intel had made him sad considering the company's reputation as a chip maker.\n\n\"You build value by having a great goal and a team that loves working to the goal,\" he posted on Tuesday. \"Intel built the fastest CPUs on the best process. This is not unlocking shareholder value, it's a fire sale. It makes me sad.\"\n\nThen on Thursday, Keller made another tweet about Intel's situation.\n\n\"The trap for Intel and many others. Innovation makes money. Money drives market cap. Market cap needs to be supported. Innovation is risky. Promote careful people. Stop innovation,\" he tweeted.\n\nJim Keller takes a selfie in Bangalore, India. | Credit: Jim Keller\n\nIs Intel being sold soon?\n\nMultiple companies are currently interested in acquiring different parts of Intel.\n\nChip designer Broadcom is reportedly interested in buying Intel's chip designing and marketing business, according to the Wall Street Journal. A move like this could make Broadcom the definitive leader in the chip designing sector as it would take over Intel's PC and server processor business. However, it would need a partner to take over other parts of the company.\n\nThat partner could be semiconductor maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC). TSMC is reportedly looking for U.S. manufacturing plants to make its chip to avoid the possible 25% tariffs President Donald Trump has proposed on silicon made overseas. Intel has multiple plants in the U.S., and TSMC is reportedly interested in acquiring them.\n\nIntel's programmable chip division is also on the market. Private equity firm Silver Lake Management is in talks to acquire a majority stake in Intel's programmable chip unit, according to Bloomberg. Intel is reportedly fielding offers to help turn the company around, but its ultimate plan remains unclear, as it has been selling off stakes in other businesses since last year.\n\nIntel did announce earlier in the month that it was planning to do more in the PC gaming handheld market. So far, AMD has been the dominant processor in handheld machines, but Intel says it plans on beefing up its staff.",

            "content": "Editor's take: We are frequently asked some version of the question, \"Will someone acquire Intel?\" At this point, we think it is highly unlikely, but these are unpredictable times. Setting aside all the principal considerations \u2013 like money, strategy, and regulatory approval \u2013 there are a few other hurdles. Chief among these is Intel's license for x86.\n\nEditor's note: We published this opinion article in November 2024, ahead of most recent Intel hurdles, CEO ousting, and growing speculation about a takeover or company split. Due to increased interest in how these developments might impact AMD, we're resurfacing this article.\n\nApparently, when Intel and AMD resolved their multi-decade dispute over x86, the cross-license agreement included provisions about transferability. If either company is acquired, the other has the right to cancel the license, effectively blocking the deal. When this was signed, we have to think everyone involved assumed it would be AMD getting acquired, but the provision seems to be mutual, and times change.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nGuest author Jonathan Goldberg is the founder of D2D Advisory, a multi-functional consulting firm. Jonathan has developed growth strategies and alliances for companies in the mobile, networking, gaming, and software industries.\n\nSo just for fun, let's think through how that would play out. Right now, the most likely potential buyer of Intel is Broadcom. What would happen if they approached AMD about this license?\n\nAMD would have a few options. Their default position would likely be to just refuse and block the deal. Broadcom is a fearsome competitor, and even if they do not directly compete in every area, a revitalized Intel under Broadcom would be a serious threat to AMD.\n\nThat said, a failed Intel would also be a major problem for AMD, if for no other reason than the two are now linked at the hip when it comes to x86, which AMD needs to remain healthy. All of which is to say there is room for negotiation.\n\nWhat would AMD ask for to grant that approval? Obviously, they would take some cash. However, there is only so much Broadcom would be willing to pay before the Intel deal becomes unappealing. That probably amounts to a few billion dollars. Beyond cash, there are things AMD could ask for that might be worth far more strategically.\n\nFor starters, they could ask Broadcom for help in their fight against Nvidia. This is an area of shared interest between the two companies, and there are likely multiple ways both could benefit from a deeper partnership. For example, Broadcom could invest more heavily in AMD's Ultra Ethernet and other networking initiatives. Alternatively, Broadcom could design an entire networking stack optimized for AMD's Mi300 series of AI accelerators.\n\nGoing further, AMD could request that Broadcom encourage its AI ASIC customers to adopt AMD-friendly networking interfaces. We imagine there are plenty of novel ways that Broadcom could promote AMD's interests in their combined fight against Nvidia.\n\nAlternatively, AMD could ask Broadcom to steer business toward ZT Systems. After AMD acquires ZT, they plan to sell off ZT's manufacturing side. Securing a healthy backlog of Broadcom orders would certainly make that business more attractive.\n\nAMD would also want to ensure Broadcom continues spinning off Altera, which competes with AMD's Xilinx division. They could even push Broadcom to commit to incorporating more Xilinx products into future designs and reference platforms.\n\nThe point of these demands is that they would cost Broadcom relatively little while potentially offering AMD significant strategic value.\n\nWhile this thought experiment is just for kicks, it highlights one more hurdle for anyone interested in buying Intel. Few potential buyers could offer AMD comparable strategic benefits. For instance, a private equity buyer for Intel would likely have only cash to offer, which might not be enough to get AMD on board. The deal is unlikely, but if it happened, it would shake up many corners of the industry.\n\nPermalink to story:\n\nApparently AMD has blocking rights for any acquisition of Intel. If a deal were to happen, what would AMD ask for?",

            "content": "Despite a long list of issues plaguing chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), the company has made meaningful progress catching up to TSMC in semiconductor manufacturing. Intel was stuck on its heavily delayed 10 nanometer (nm) process for a long time, which caused all sorts of problems on the product side of the business. The Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes, which are used for Meteor Lake PC CPUs and the latest generation of Xeon server CPUs, respectively, were big upgrades for Intel.\n\nIntel previously canceled the Intel 20A process, which was meant to be a stepping stone to develop important new technologies. For its latest PC chips, Intel turned to TSMC instead of using the Intel 20A process as it reallocated resources to Intel 18A. The Intel 18A process, the final node in the company's original foundry roadmap, is supposed to bring Intel back to parity with TSMC in terms of performance and efficiency.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nIntel 18A has arrived\n\nAccording to a page on Intel's website, the Intel 18A process is now ready. It's important to understand what \"ready\" means here. Development of the process is complete, but it will still take time for chips to start rolling out of Intel's factory at high volumes. Intel noted that foundry customer tape outs will begin during the first half of this year. The tape out is the final stage of the design process, with the next step being manufacturing.\n\nThe Intel 18A process comes with two features that will drive performance and efficiency gains compared to Intel 3. First, Intel 18A uses a new transistor design called RibbonFET, replacing the previous FinFET architecture that was introduced in 2011. The move to RibbonFET will improve performance per watt and reduce power leakage, along with other benefits.\n\nSecond, Intel 18A is the first process from any foundry that supports backside power delivery. Intel's flavor of this technology, called PowerVia, moves certain components to the backside of the die to improve the efficiency of power distribution. PowerVia alone will deliver a meaningful bump in performance.\n\nIntel claims that Intel 18A delivers a 15% improvement in performance per watt compared to Intel 3, along with a 30% bump in chip density. How Intel 18A stacks up against TSMC's top-tier process nodes remains an open question, but at the very least, Intel 18A should close the gap significantly.\n\nMeaningful revenue will take a while\n\nDon't expect all that much external foundry revenue from Intel 18A until 2026. Intel has previously indicated that ramping up to high-volume production will be a process that will extend into next year. The company has a few big-name customers for Intel 18A already lined up, including Microsoft, but it will take time for Intel to build up capacity.\n\nPanther Lake, Intel's next-generation laptop CPU family, will likely act as the debut for the Intel 18A process in a high-volume product. The company plans to ship Panther Lake by the end of the year, with volumes likely ramping up into 2026. Later in 2026, Intel plans to use the Intel 18A process for its Clearwater Forest server CPU.\n\nWith Intel 18A ready for production, Intel now needs to find more customers and fill its planned production capacity with new orders. That involves winning the trust of chip designers at a time when Intel's future is very much up in the air. Rumors of potential spin-offs, acquisitions, and mergers are creating a complicated picture for potential customers.\n\nIf the Intel 18A process lives up to the company's promises and matches TSMC in terms of performance and efficiency, it would mark an incredible turnaround for the manufacturing side of the business. It will likely take until 2026, though, for this achievement to benefit Intel's financial results.

You just bought a new laptop, and unlike your last one, this device is an \u201cAI PC.\u201d The distinction means you can now run all the latest AI applications directly on your device without draining your battery, keeping your data private and secure.\n\nAI PCs\n\nIf you stopped by a Sears circa 1960 to buy a television, the sales clerk\u2019s first question for you would\u2019ve been, \u201cColor or black and white?\u201d Only after hearing the answer could they help you find the television that was right for you.\n\nToday\u2019s computer buyers are facing their own fork in the consumer tech road as manufacturers begin rolling out \u201cAI PCs\u201d alongside their traditional models.\n\n\u201cAI PCs are laptops or desktop computers equipped with specific hardware that make them suitable for on-device AI tasks or features,\u201d AI educator Paul Couvert tells Freethink. \u201cGenerally, they are more expensive than regular PCs when it comes to laptops, but they are becoming more and more affordable.\u201d\n\nTo better understand this new category of computers, this week\u2019s Future Explored is digging into the evolutions of PCs, what sets AI models apart from the rest, and why you may or may not want to buy one the next time you\u2019re in the market for a new computer.\n\nWhere we\u2019ve been\n\nWhere we\u2019re going (maybe)\n\nAI isn\u2019t brand new\u2014research into machines that can \u201cthink\u201d has been going on since the 1940s\u2014but the tech surged to the top of the public consciousness following OpenAI\u2019s November 2022 release of ChatGPT, an AI capable of engaging in human-like conversations.\n\nWithin two months, more than 100 million people were using ChatGPT, and almost as quickly, seemingly every company, whether it was selling toys or TVs, was boasting about its products\u2019 AI features.\n\nThe AI hype grew so quickly that by February 2023, the Federal Trade Commission was warning companies that they had better not be overpromising what their AI products could do or exaggerating their benefits over existing goods.\n\n\u201c[AI is] a marketing term,\u201d Michael Atleson, an attorney in the FTC\u2019s Division of Advertising Practices, wrote in a blog post. \u201cRight now it\u2019s a hot one, and at the FTC, one thing we know about hot marketing terms is that some advertisers won\u2019t be able to stop themselves from overusing and abusing them.\u201d\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, it\u2019s hard not to be a little skeptical of \u201cAI PCs.\u201d Are they really a significant advance in computing? Or just another example of the AI label being slapped onto a product to encourage sales?\n\nWhat is an AI PC?\n\nTo start to answer that question, we need to take a look at how the AI applications now making their way into our workplaces and homes operate.\n\nAI tools like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Apple Intelligence require a lot of processing power. If you access these AIs online, this processing takes place at a data center with enough servers to parse your request and respond within seconds.\n\nHowever, there are benefits to having an AI do its processing locally, right on your computer.\n\nA key one is that it keeps your data private and secure\u2014no need to worry about a third-party seeing what you\u2019re doing or being hacked. If you were paying a monthly subscription for an AI that runs in the cloud, running locally can save you money, and because your data doesn\u2019t have to travel anywhere for processing, the approach can reduce latency and lead to faster results.\n\nTo take advantage of these benefits, though, you need a PC with enough processing power onboard to run the AI without slowing your system to a crawl. This is what tech companies say AI PCs can deliver.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a PC that can run AI on either an NPU, GPU, or CPU,\u201d Josh Newman, general manager and vice president of product marketing and management at Intel\u2019s Client Computing Group, tells Freethink. \u201cThat\u2019s integrated into the PC so that all of the new software that is using AI models\u2026will run smoothly and can deliver new experiences to customers.\u201d\n\nIntel Intel\u2019s Ultra Core processors include a CPU, GPU, and NPU.\n\nLet\u2019s break that down.\n\nIf you\u2019re at all familiar with the inner workings of PCs, you\u2019ve likely heard about CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs (graphics processing units) before. The former acts like a computer\u2019s \u201cbrain\u201d\u2014it interprets commands and carries out instructions. The latter was initially designed to process graphics for PCs, freeing up the CPU to work on other tasks and helping the whole system run more smoothly, but they\u2019ve since proven useful for other applications, too, like mining cryptocurrency and training and running AIs.\n\nThis might, however, be your first time hearing about NPUs (neural processing units). These processing devices are specifically designed to handle AI tasks, which is why they\u2019re sometimes called \u201cAI chips\u201d or \u201cAI accelerators.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want that to be really high fidelity\u2026 You want it to be seamless. That\u2019s where the NPU comes in.\u201d Josh Newman\n\nWhile GPUs have been a standard component of PCs for more than a decade (and CPUs have always been a part of them), NPUs are a newer feature, and while there isn\u2019t a universally accepted definition of an \u201cAI PC,\u201d having an NPU is often considered a requirement and concretely sets these systems apart from regular ones.\n\n\u201cNPUs are specifically tuned for AI workloads to run them fast and at lowest possible power, so they\u2019re great for AI applications that will always be running in the background,\u201d says Newman.\n\n\u201cYou think about video green screening, the background removal that\u2019s constantly running for the hours you\u2019re on Teams or Zoom calls,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou want that to be really high fidelity, but you also want it to not take too much power or make the fans go up while you\u2019re working. You want it to be seamless. That\u2019s where the NPU comes in.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what it looks like to have a CPU, GPU, and now 45+ TOPS NPU working together on a Copilot+ PC (Surface Laptop) to deliver unrivaled performance. Here is a demo from my colleague Vivek. pic.twitter.com/daLiYIPOlc \u2014 Yusuf Mehdi (@yusuf_i_mehdi) May 22, 2024\n\nDo I need an AI PC?\n\nThe answer to this question depends on what you plan to do with your computer.\n\nIf you\u2019re someone like Couvert, who does a lot with AI, paying extra for a PC with an NPU could be worthwhile, especially if you\u2019re buying a laptop\u2014while many desktops can efficiently handle AI applications even without an NPU, running those same AIs through a laptop\u2019s CPU or GPU could slow the system and drain its battery.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m daily using both a Chromebook Plus and a Windows Copilot + laptop with a Snapdragon X Elite chip that allows me to run AI models locally,\u201d Couvert tells Freethink. \u201cThe Copilot+ PC is very useful to me for interacting with AI models without being connected to an external server, which is a huge plus for privacy and cost efficiency. It also allows me to run my own AI agents basically for free, without having to rely on third-party APIs from OpenAI or other providers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you need to change your laptop, it\u2019s worth considering this option even today.\u201d Paul Couvert\n\nIf the only time you use AI is to blur your background in Zoom videos, and your current system seems to be handling that task just fine, switching to an AI PC right now might not be imperative. However, new AI tools are rolling out all the time, and some of them already require an NPU, so if you\u2019re going to buy a new PC anyway and think you might want to take advantage of AI more often in the future, you may want to think about upgrading to one with an NPU.\n\n\u201cGiven that AI PCs, specifically those using Snapdragon X chips, are becoming less expensive, if you need to change your laptop, it\u2019s worth considering this option even today,\u201d says Couvert.\n\nWait long enough, though, and you won\u2019t have to decide between an AI PC and a regular one. Just like it did with GPUs, the tech industry seems to be planning to make NPUs a standard part of PCs moving forward, and eventually, finding one without an NPU will be as challenging as tracking down a brand new black-and-white TV.\n\n\u201cPretty soon, all PCs will be AI PCs,\u201d says Newman.\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear from you!

            "content": "Why it matters: As Intel's chip design and foundry businesses face mounting pressure that could jeopardize the company's future, much is riding on the success of its upcoming 18A node. As Intel finalizes its latest semiconductor process, 2025 will be a decisive year for its efforts to legitimize its foundry division and regain competitiveness against TSMC and Samsung.\n\nIntel has announced that its 18A process node is \"ready\" for third-party clients, with tape-out design finalizations set to begin in the first half of this year. The node is expected to introduce advanced semiconductor features ahead of products featuring TSMC's N2 process, which is set to debut in 2026.\n\nShort for 18 Angstroms (or 1.8nm), 18A promises a 30 percent increase in chip density and a 15 percent improvement in performance per watt compared to Intel 3. The company plans to use the process for its upcoming Panther Lake laptop processors and Clearwater Forest server CPUs, both of which are expected to launch before the end of the year.\n\nOne of 18A's most significant innovations is backside power delivery through PowerVia. By moving coarse-pitch metals and bumps to the die's rear and implementing nanoscale through-silicon vias, Intel aims to improve ISO power performance by four percent and increase standard cell utilization by five to ten percent.\n\nAnother key advancement is RibbonFET, Intel's take on gate-all-around transistor technology. This design enables finer control over electrical currents, reducing power leakage \u2013 an increasingly critical challenge as chips become smaller and more densely packed.\n\nTMSC is also readying a gate-all-around architecture solution for its 2nm N2 node, but volume production isn't expected to begin until late 2025. The first consumer products featuring N2 likely won't arrive until at least mid-2026, and TSMC plans to implement backside power delivery with its A16 node that same year.\n\nA recent report comparing 18A and N2 suggests that Intel's node may offer higher performance, while TSMC's achieves greater density. After trailing its competitors for years, Intel has a chance of providing semiconductors that could outperform TSMC's in certain tasks and reach the market sooner.\n\nIf 18A is successful, it would provide Intel's foundry business with a much-needed victory amid deep financial losses that have fueled speculation about a potential breakup or sale.\n\nThe company recently reported a staggering $13 billion loss for 2024, while TSMC posted an operating profit of $41 billion. Given Intel's financial struggles and growing concerns over domestic U.S. chip supplies, some have even speculated that TSMC could play a role in stabilizing Intel's foundries.",

            "content": "\"Intel 18A is now ready.\" So proclaims a new landing page on Intel's website for the company's all-important new 18A chip production node. But what does it mean for the PC?\n\nWe already knew that Intel's next laptop chip, Panther Lake, is due to be made, at least in part, on the new 18A node. That's supposed to be going into volume production later this year, though we're not expecting 18A-powered laptops until early 2026.\n\nIntel's next desktop CPU, codenamed Nova Lake, is likewise a 2026 product according to Intel. So, what to make of Intel's claims of immediate 18A readiness?\n\nThe new web portal is arguably more aimed at customers for its nascent foundry business than bigging up its own chips. \"Intel 18A is now ready for customer projects with the tape outs beginning in the first half of 2025,\" the website says.\n\nIn terms of in-house chips, Intel does call out the Clearwater Forest server CPU as an example of \"18A in action\" on the new website. Clearwater Forest was originally on Intel's roadmaps as a 2025 product. However, at the end of January, Intel pushed Clearwater Forest back to the first half of 2026, which doesn't exactly seem like a huge vote of confidence in 18A.\n\nOf course, 18A is the final part of Intel's bold \"five nodes in four years\" plan (also known as 5N4Y), which kicked off with Intel 7, then went to Intel 4 as used in the Meteor Lake mobile CPU, followed by Intel 3, Intel 20A and finally Intel 18A.\n\nIt was mid-2021 when Intel's then-new-but-now-departed CEO Pat Gelsinger floated the idea. That means 18A needs to be ready for summer 2025 to be on track. With that in mind, the cynic might conclude that 18A's announced readiness for customers, all the while Intel doesn't seem to be able to get one of its own chips on 18A ready, is something of a PR stunt.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nArguably, you might conclude that about 5N4Y in general. Looking at each of the nodes in turn, Intel 7 is a version of the same 10nm technology that Intel had been struggling with for a decade, so not really a new node.\n\nIntel 4 was certainly new, albeit a rebrand of the planned 7nm node. Calling Intel 3 a new node is a bit of a stretch, being as it is a revised on Intel 4. You could say the same about Intel 20A and 18A, but Intel cancelled 20A in any case.\n\nSo, at the very least, Intel is down to four nodes in four years. But taken in the round, of the five \"new\" nodes, only Intel 4 and Intel 18A are unambiguously new. And it remains to be seen whether any chips on 18A are actually available within Intel's self-imposed time frame.\n\nPanther Lake will be the first 18A chip in the PC, probably not until next year. (Image credit: Future)\n\nStill, if 18A is as good as Intel is cracking it up to be, whether it's complete \"ready\" now or early next year probably doesn't matter. It'll be a great node that will not only enable some really competitive chips for Intel, but surely have customers queuing up to have their chips manufactured by the only real alternative to Taiwanese mega-foundry TSMC.\n\nAmong other advantages and refinements of the 18A node, Intel is making the following claims:\n\nUp to 15% better performance per watt and 30% better chip density vs. the Intel 3 process node.\n\nThe earliest available sub-2nm advanced node manufactured in North America, offering a resilient supply alternative for customers.\n\nIndustry-first PowerVia backside-power delivery technology, improving density and cell utilization by 5 to 10 percent and reducing resistive power delivery droop, resulting in up to 4 percent ISO-power performance improvement and greatly reduced inherent resistance (IR) drop vs. front-side power designs.\n\nRibbonFET gate-all-around (GAA) transistor technology, enabling precise control of electrical current. RibbonFET allows further miniaturization of chip components while reducing power leakage, a critical concern for increasingly-dense chips.\n\nIf 18A really does deliver on all that, it'll certainly be highly competitive with anything TSMC has to offer. Broadly, Intel 18A is thought to be less dense in terms of logic gates than TSMC's upcoming N2 node and more akin by that metric to the N3 node that TSMC has been banging out for about 18 months now.\n\nHowever, another key measure is SRAM density. SRAM cells are used to provide critical on-chip cache memory. It was thought until recently that 18A was at best on par with TSMC N3 for SRAM density. However, it's recently emerged that Intel 18A in fact offers pretty much exactly the same claimed SRAM density as TSMC N2.\n\nMeanwhile, TSMC is not planning to include backside power delivery until its own A16 node. Long story short, backside power relocates the power interconnects from the top of the chip to the underside of the silicon layer, thereby separating it from signal interconnects. This reduces interference and shortens the distance power has to travel, which improves efficiency and performance.\n\nAs above, Intel 18A has backside power, which could be a big advantage over TSMC N2. Ultimately, we'll have to wait and see. But we absolutely have our fingers and toes crossed that 18A works out. The alternative could be very bad for Intel. Gelsinger did say, after all, that he had \"bet the whole company on 18A.\"\n\nAnd the way the chip industry is going these days, \"very bad for Intel\" could quickly turn into even more expensive chips for the PC.\n\nWe need as much competition in the industry as we can get. So, we generally agree with the sentiments an Intel engineer posted and then removed from Linkedin earlier this week, which basically boil down to not giving up on Intel just as it is about to turn things around with 18A.",

            "content": "The US military has significantly increased its surveillance of Mexican drug cartels over the past two weeks, with sophisticated spy planes flying at least 18 missions over the southwestern US and in international airspace around the Baja peninsula, according to open-source data and three US officials familiar with the missions.\n\nThe flights, conducted over a 10-day period in late January and early February, represent a dramatic escalation in activity, current and former military officials say, and come as President Donald Trump directs the military to secure the border and deter cartels\u2019 drug smuggling operations.\n\nThe Pentagon has historically flown only about one surveillance mission a month around the US-Mexico border, according to one former military official with deep experience in homeland defense. Typically, officials instead focus these planes on collecting intelligence on other priorities, such as Russian activity in Ukraine or hunting Russian or Chinese submarines.\n\nThe activity highlights how the military has already begun shifting finite US national security capabilities away from overseas threats to focus on the southern border, where Trump has declared a national emergency.\n\nAt least 11 of these recent flights around the US have been by Navy P-8s, a particularly prized plane with a sophisticated radar system that specializes in identifying submarines but is also capable of collecting imagery and signals intelligence.\n\nOne nearly six-hour flight on February 3 was conducted by a U-2 spy plane, one of the US military\u2019s most venerated reconnaissance aircraft, designed during the Cold War for collecting high-altitude imagery of the Soviet Union.\n\nCurrent and former military officials with deep experience in counternarcotics work on the border said they could not recall a U-2 being used for this purpose before.\n\nA U-2 spy plane, seen in 2018. - Ben Margot/AP/File\n\nA Navy P-8A Poseidon patrol aircraft, seen in 2024. - Damon Coulter/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images/File\n\nAn Air Force RC-135 Rivet Joint, seen in 2011. - Master Sgt. William Greer/US Air Force/File\n\nThe flight paths span the US-Mexico border, with missions in California, Arizona and Texas. CNN also identified at least one longer mission that looped around the Baja peninsula and passed near Sinaloa on February 4. That plane, an Air Force RC-135 \u201cRivet,\u201d specializes in hoovering up communications from the ground.\n\nThe flight track looping around the Baja peninsula has been in use \u201cfor a long time,\u201d one defense official said. But it\u2019s \u201cgetting more use now.\u201d\n\nDespite flying over US airspace along the border, these aircraft are capable of collecting intelligence deep within Mexico, former officials said.\n\nMilitary takes lead on counternarcotics\n\nThe ramp-up underscores Trump\u2019s determination to wield the military as the lead agency tackling counternarcotics and border security \u2014 two issues that have historically been led by domestic law enforcement agencies.\n\nLess clear is how the Trump administration plans to leverage information it acquires. It could be used to build a body of evidence for further foreign terrorist designations, or even to identify information that could be given to the Mexican military to help target cartel activities.\n\nSome current and former US officials expressed quiet concerns to CNN that the intelligence flights could be part of an effort to find targets for the US military to strike itself.\n\nTrump has threatened to drop bombs on fentanyl labs and send special forces to take out cartel leaders, actions that could violate Mexico\u2019s sovereignty and disrupt relations with the United States\u2019 largest trading partner.\n\nUS Marines adjust concertina wire along the the Mexico-US border, as seen from Tijuana, Mexico, on February 6. - Jorge Duenes/Reuters\n\nTrump has kicked off the process of designating cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a move that has raised questions about the potential for direct US military action inside Mexico.\n\nThe president has also ordered thousands of additional active-duty troops to the border, even as migrant crossings are at their lowest level since 2020.\n\nThose troops are assisting US Border Patrol and providing more intelligence specialists to assess threats and migrant flows, according to sources familiar with the planning. The troops are not authorized to perform law enforcement roles, such as making arrests or seizing drugs. They\u2019re also barred from engaging with migrants other than helping transport them.\n\nCurrent and former US officials see a clear effort to shift more responsibility for America\u2019s counternarcotics mission to the military, which has decades of experience fighting other non-state terrorist groups around the globe that have some operational similarities to the cartels.\n\n\u201cI think the cartels would be foolish to take on the military, but we know they\u2019ve taken on the Mexican military before, but now we have the United States military,\u201d border czar Tom Homan told ABC News on Thursday. \u201cDo I expect violence to escalate? Absolutely, because the cartels are making record amounts of money.\u201d\n\nA cartel scout looks through binoculars on the US-Mexico border in Sunland Park, New Mexico, on January 24. - Justin Hamel/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut former officials and analysts point out that cartels also differ from Islamist terror groups overseas in key ways. They are essentially commercial organizations, not ideological ones. They are not interested in governing populations or seizing territory. They in some cases are deeply entwined with parts of the Mexican government \u2014 which the US military actively partners with and supports.\n\n\u201cYes, parts of the state collude with the cartels, but there are others resisting, and we need them \u2014 and [Mexican President Claudia] Sheinbaum most of all \u2014 to work with us,\u201d Will Freeman, a fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a recent essay in The New York Times.\n\nThat makes cartels a fundamentally different adversary from what the Defense Department is used to countering \u2014 part of why, until now, most of the military\u2019s counternarcotics work has been done in support of law enforcement agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAmong those designated as foreign terrorist organizations are groups such as ISIS, Boko Haram and Hamas, among others.\n\nCNN\u2019s Oren Liebermann and Sanika Tank contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nAlthough the NBA returned to action after the All-Star break with one game Wednesday and a nearly full slate of action Thursday, the league's focus was elsewhere after the stunning news that San Antonio Spurs star big man Victor Wembanyama will miss the rest of the season due to deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder.\n\nThe announcement sent shock waves through the league, given Wembanyama's status as he followed a brilliant Rookie of the Year season with an even better sophomore campaign. He appeared in his first All-Star Game over the weekend and was the leading contender for Defensive Player of the Year honors, a shoo-in to make an All-NBA team and, potentially, garnering some Most Valuable Player consideration.\n\nAll of that, though, moves to the background as the focus shifts to his immediate and long-term health. So, with the association back in action, we'll look at the leaguewide reaction to the Wembanyama news, plus examine several lessons from the pre-All-Star-break portion of the schedule in our weekly trip around the NBA.\n\nJump to a section:\n\nWhat's next for Wembanyama, Spurs?\n\nWhy aprons couldn't stop megadeals\n\n... And why so many got done now\n\nMore lessons from season's first half\n\nWembanyama's health is now a major story\n\nBontemps: A moment that stuck with me during All-Star Weekend occurred during Saturday's media availability inside Oakland's Oracle Arena, where Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards was asked about possibly becoming the next face of the NBA.\n\n\"No, not really,\" Edwards said. \"That's what they got Wemby for.\"\n\nThat's the ascension Wembanyama has enjoyed over the past two years; less than two months after his 21st birthday, he's seen as the heir apparent to LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant.\n\nAnd that led to the universal shock from sources I spoke to around the NBA in the wake of Thursday's news that Wembanyama will be out for the season due to the blood clotting issue in his right shoulder.\n\nBrandon Ingram had virtually the same condition six years ago and has come back without issue, giving credence to the belief, per sources, that Wembanyama can come back without any problems. But for a league that has invested so much in Wembanyama, and for a Spurs team that just traded for De'Aaron Fox and is set up to be one of the biggest factors in the NBA for at least the next decade, it's a shock unlike many I can remember.\n\nplay 2:09 Windy on Wemby injury news: 'The Spurs weren't going anywhere this year' Brian Windhorst tries to look at some of the positives after the news broke that Victor Wembanyama has been ruled out for the rest of the season.\n\nWindhorst: The Spurs were jolted by the diagnosis, both concerned and relieved that doctors had caught such a scary issue. It has been an emotional season in San Antonio. Coach Gregg Popovich suffered a stroke while at Frost Bank Arena before a game Nov. 2. On the day of an important game in Austin, Texas, on Thursday, the team found out before shootaround that Wembanyama was out for the season, undercutting an annual rodeo trip that was built around a push to make the play-in tournament.\n\nThe trade for Fox, though largely seen as a positive development, was destabilizing for a franchise not known for midseason moves. And there was the trip to Paris, which was thrilling for the large traveling party there to support Wembanyama but also emotionally taxing. \"This has been one long, crazy season,\" one team source said.\n\nBontemps: There's also the secondary fact that San Antonio wasn't a title contender this season and will likely have a significantly better draft pick.\n\nFor scouts and executives I talked to, once the shock of the news passed, the thought shifted to whether this could be a repeat of what happened to San Antonio during the 1996-97 season, when David Robinson's back injury created the pathway to the franchise landing No. 1 pick Tim Duncan.\n\nImagine if this leads to the Spurs getting another No. 1 pick and the right to pair Wembanyama with a prospect such as Cooper Flagg. That could be the basis of a team competing for championships well into the 2030s.\n\nThe CBA didn't jam up transactions as much as we thought\n\nWindhorst: The Golden State Warriors and their decade of huge spending -- $690 million in luxury tax since 2015, including this year's expected $12 million bill -- were one of the teams targeted by the changes to the collective bargaining agreement. And they started the season within about $200,000 of the second apron, having been \"hard-capped\" and unable to spend more. In theory, this should've limited their ability to trade and use money to facilitate deals.\n\nInstead, they made two significant trades, acquiring guard Dennis Schroder in December and then landing former All-Star Jimmy Butler (sending Schroder back out) at the trade deadline while giving Butler a two-year, $114 million deal to entice him to \"agree\" to the trade. And earlier in deadline week, Golden State had the framework of a three-team trade that could have landed the team Kevin Durant -- before Durant said he didn't want the deal.\n\nThat doesn't sound like a rich team being limited by the new rules.\n\nBontemps: I didn't expect a lot of activity at this year's deadline, and I was wrong. I didn't anticipate Luka Doncic being traded, either, which certainly played a part in the fireworks before the deadline. There also was a lot of swapping of one big contract for another (Butler for Andrew Wiggins, De'Aaron Fox for Zach LaVine among them), which is one way to get around the CBA limitations.\n\nWindhorst: As one executive told me this week, \"I think what we've seen is the real penal place to be is the second apron, and mostly because of the [rule against aggregating contracts]. If you're in the first apron, it's harder, and you may need a third team, but it is manageable.\"\n\nThere are three second-apron teams: Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns and Minnesota Timberwolves. Boston and Phoenix made salary-dumping trades, and Minnesota made no deals. Those teams were affected, as the Suns tried and failed for weeks to make a trade to add to their roster. Over the last 24 hours before the deadline, Minnesota and Phoenix tried to put together a long shot Durant deal, sources said. But it was complex, needed extreme measures to satisfy trade rules and ultimately didn't happen.\n\nThere are four first-apron teams: the New York Knicks, Los Angeles Lakers, Milwaukee Bucks and Denver Nuggets. The Lakers and Bucks made significant trades -- Doncic to L.A. and Kyle Kuzma to the Bucks -- using third teams to facilitate the deals.\n\nBontemps: That echoes my discussions with league executives this week. We still saw a lot of deals that required a third team to take on money. The old paradigm that three-team deals are zero-team deals no longer applies under this new system.\n\nThere's also a line that an executive has repeated to me the past few months: \"Motivated teams will find a way to get things done.\"\n\nAge isn't just a number -- it's a problem\n\nBontemps: Typically, older rosters have championship mettle and expectations, and younger squads need seasoning to reach their goal. This season, that has not been the case. Some of that, according to an Eastern Conference executive, could be attributed to movement around the league.\n\n\"A lot of times, successful teams have been older ones,\" the exec said. \"I think it's harder now to go out and create a team of older players without having chemistry and continuity. I don't know if that model is going to work anymore.\"\n\nWindhorst: The youngest team in the league also has its best record. The Oklahoma City Thunder had an average age of 24.1 years on opening night. The Grizzlies, the No. 2 seed in the West, were right behind OKC with an average age of 24.3. The Cavaliers, the No. 1 team in the East, rank in the middle of the pack for average age, but their starting lineup doesn't have anyone over age 28.\n\nThe two oldest teams in the league going into the season were the Suns and the Philadelphia 76ers. They are the only teams with average ages over 28 and also are among the league's biggest underachievers.\n\nBontemps: Part of the reason for that, according to a couple of executives I spoke to, is the NBA Cup's impact on the schedule. There is a more condensed slate on either side of the knockout rounds of the Cup, something that could benefit younger teams.\n\n\"It's impacted the density of the schedule across the board,\" the East executive said. \"So, it makes sense some of these younger teams are fresher.\"\n\nplay 1:06 Draymond believes declining physicality has made the NBA boring Draymond Green explains why he thinks the league is not as exciting due to it being less physical.\n\nWindhorst: The Warriors started the season as the fourth-oldest team in the league and got older when they traded for 35-year-old Butler after they were out of the top 10 in the West at the season's midpoint.\n\n\"They say in the NBA you win with men, not with boys, and there's a lot of truth to that when you look over the history of the league,\" one veteran coach said. \"But it's hard to win with a lot of old men because even if they're great, they get hurt.\"\n\nDepth means more than ever\n\nWindhorst: The Cavs have 11 players who average at least 19 minutes, and no one averages over 31. The Thunder have 12 players who average at least 15 minutes -- though they've had various injuries that allow that number to be boosted -- and only two players play over 30. The Grizzlies have nine players who have played at least 40 games and average 20 minutes, and one of them isn't Ja Morant, who plays just 29 minutes but has played in only 32 games.\n\nThe Celtics have nine players averaging at least 17 minutes, though Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown's per-game minute loads are up a bit this season. The Indiana Pacers can play 11-deep when healthy, each averaging 17 minutes.\n\nThese are all teams in the top four of the conference standings. Young and deep. It helps teams win a lot of regular-season games.\n\n\"With the style of the games and the pace of play, the league has never been more physically demanding,\" one general manager said. \"It wears guys down and out.\"\n\nBontemps: The question, though, is whether it will lead to playoff success. We have seen teams with good, but not great, talent have plenty of success in the regular season -- the 2012-13 Denver Nuggets, in particular, come to mind, after the collection of good players remaining after the Carmelo Anthony trade won 57 games. That team, however, lost in the first round of the playoffs to a Warriors team led by Stephen Curry, whose individual star power was too much for Denver to overcome.\n\n\"I think there's always been proof depth can win you a lot of games over the 82,\" an East scout said. \"I don't think we can know if that will lead to wins in playoff games until the spring.\"\n\nMultiple scouts and executives pointed to Memphis -- which, as Brian pointed out, has a uniquely egalitarian approach to minutes -- as an example of whether this new paradigm could work.\n\nDefense is (sort of) back\n\nBontemps: It wasn't long ago that it felt like there was one think piece after another about the death of the traditional center, and whether teams would keep playing smaller.\n\nBut after the Nuggets and Celtics won titles the past two seasons playing with above-average positional size, and the Cavaliers and Thunder have the league's two best records with rosters that feature two 7-footers among their five best players, we have seen that formula be turned on its head.\n\n\"It's a copycat league,\" one executive said. \"You see Cleveland playing two bigs and having success, and other teams are going to try to copy that model.\n\n\"Things have shifted big-time.\"\n\nWe also have seen a depression in offense across the league. Despite all of the noise about 3-pointers, the average offensive rating is down from last season, and several sources pointed to officiating changes enacted around this time last year having an impact.\n\nIt's a good reminder that any time we think things are shifting, the league swings in another direction. The goal for teams is to figure out the next inefficiency before anyone else.\n\nTeams got summer business done in the winter\n\nBontemps: One of the themes of the trade deadline was teams choosing to do their business now rather than waiting for the offseason. Memphis moved Marcus Smart at the trade deadline to ensure it could re-sign Santi Aldama and extend Jaren Jackson Jr.'s deal if necessary.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks could have waited until the summer to move on from Luka Doncic -- and many would argue that might have gotten them a bigger haul -- but instead prioritized getting Anthony Davis for a playoff run this season. Many around the league expected the De'Aaron Fox deal to happen this summer. \"The Fox thing caught me off guard just because of the timing,\" one executive said.\n\nBut now Fox, too, can get a bigger extension this summer by being on the Spurs.",

            "content": "TSMC will not make Intel great again\n\nTaking over Intel\u2019s struggling factories would be time-consuming, expensive, and likely weaken TSMC\u2019s position\n\nBy Catherine Thorbecke / Bloomberg Opinion\n\n\n\n\n\nTrying to force a partnership between Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and Intel Corp would be a wildly complex ordeal.\n\nAlready, the reported request from the Trump administration for TSMC to take a controlling stake in Intel\u2019s US factories is facing valid questions about feasibility from all sides. Washington would likely not support a foreign company operating Intel\u2019s domestic factories, Reuters reported \u2014 just look at how that is going over in the steel sector.\n\nMeanwhile, many in Taiwan are concerned about the company being forced to transfer its bleeding-edge tech capabilities and give up its strategic advantage. This is especially significant because this dominance not only keeps it ahead of industry rivals, but is also seen by many as the \u201choly mountain\u201d that safeguards the nation from potential Chinese aggression.\n\nIllustration: Tania Chou\n\nOn a more practical level, the two chipmakers are vastly different in everything from corporate cultures to manufacturing operations. TSMC revolutionized the industry with its pure-play foundry approach, Intel has historically produced chips it helped design. It would be a time-consuming and expensive headache for TSMC to take over Intel\u2019s factories in the US or integrate them to its own.\n\nIt is not clear that this proposed tie-up would be enough to restore Intel\u2019s glory. The Santa Clara, California-based company has already been showered with favor from the US government via policies aimed at strategically onshoring semiconductor manufacturing, but it has still been plagued with struggles.\n\nAs interim co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus said on the most recent earnings call: \u201cThere are no quick fixes.\u201d The company failed to effectively jump on the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and has been falling further behind rivals technologically, ending last year with its lowest revenue in more than a decade.\n\nAll this stands in contrast to TSMC\u2019s strong performance. Even more remarkable: The two were roughly equal in value approximately five years ago, but the Taiwanese firm\u2019s market cap now is some nine times that of its rival. TSMC previously seemed acutely aware of how difficult it would be to turn Intel\u2019s fortunes around. Back in October, when Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei (\u9b4f\u54f2\u5bb6) was asked if the company was interesting in acquiring Intel\u2019s factories, Wei responded: \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d\n\nAlthough TSMC\u2019s change of heart appears to have come as a result of a request from US President Donald Trump\u2019s team, it is not going to change mounting challenges Intel is facing.\n\nIt is worth remembering how we got here. The reports of the joint venture emerged after Trump campaigned on the proposal of introducing tariffs to Taiwan\u2019s chip industry to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. However, Taiwan did not \u201csteal\u201d the industry; it got ahead by pioneering the made-to-order chipmaking business model that Silicon Valley had overlooked. This background is significant, because Trump has shown a habit of threatening tariffs as a negotiating tactic. In this case, his goal is restoring domestic chip production.\n\nTariffs, however, would not get that job done. TSMC would likely be able pass those costs onto customers, and its two biggest are firms at the heart of the US\u2019 tech ambitions: Nvidia Corp and Apple Inc. The tech leaders that Trump has sought to maintain close ties with would not be happy to pay more for cutting-edge chips.\n\nAs influential technology analyst Kuo Ming-Chi (\u90ed\u660e\u9324) has pointed out, TSMC\u2019s yearly chip exports to the US are worth less than its monthly revenue. Still, TSMC \u201ccannot simply \u2018accept tariffs\u2019 and ignore Trump\u2019s statements,\u201d Kuo says, but knowing what the president ultimately wants could give TSMC some room to get ahead on its own.\n\nThe proposal of TSMC running Intel\u2019s factories is still at very early stages. It is not even clear that Intel is open to the deal, which could involve other US chip design companies to counter concerns of foreign ownership.\n\nTSMC\u2019s representatives and the Trump team should find some middle ground that does not involve a complicated and costly tie-up with Intel. TSMC could start by offering up more investment into its existing US chipmaking efforts in Arizona. This would help meet Trump\u2019s aim of winning back production while still allowing TSMC to keep its tech mastery in-house. When it comes to countering Beijing, TSMC and the US tech industry are on the same side.\n\nThe Taiwanese company\u2019s chipmaking prowess is the best in the world, so many firms riding the AI wave are dependent on it. This makes the threat of tariffs seem like an empty or self-defeating move and provides the firm with significant leverage. However, there is always the danger that TSMC could lose that edge with a costly entanglement that threatens to dilute its dominance.\n\nCatherine Thorbecke is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asia tech.

            "content": "A former Intel engineer on Thursday pleaded guilty in federal court to stealing and sharing trade secrets, a felony, to benefit himself and his new employer.\n\nVarun Gupta worked as a product marketing engineer for Intel from July 2010 to Jan. 17, 2020, but left to work for Microsoft.\n\nHe\u2019s currently attending graduate school in France and flew back to Oregon to enter a plea before U.S. District Judge Amy Baggio in Portland.\n\nGupta, now 44, violated an Intel trade secret agreement by connecting a personal USB drive to his company-issued laptop and downloading approximately 180 files that included Intel trade secrets while still employed in January 2020, according to his plea agreement.\n\nOn his last day at Intel, he transferred about 3,900 electronic files, including many proprietary documents, from his company-issued computer to a second personal hard drive, according to the plea deal that he signed.\n\nFour days later, he began working for Microsoft and over seven months accessed Intel trade secrets related to customized product design and pricing for significant purchases of computer processors, including while serving as a representative for Microsoft during \u201chead-to-head\u201d negotiations with Intel, the agreement says.\n\nWhile working for Microsoft, he connected a hard drive that contained Intel material to his Microsoft-issued computer more than 100 times and accessed 179 documents and transferred eight Intel proprietary documents to his Microsoft-issued computer in February 2020, according to the plea agreement.\n\nHe also accessed a confidential Intel PowerPoint presentation that contained a business analysis for one of its large customers and major competitor of Gupta\u2019s new employer, according to the agreement.\n\nWillam M. Narus, Oregon\u2019s acting U.S. attorney, said the government will seek an eight-month prison sentence when Gupta returns for sentencing on Aug. 12.\n\nDefense attorneys Joanna Perini-Abbott and David Angeli can argue for a lesser sentence at the hearing.\n\nIntel incurred about $280,000 in attorney fees to investigate and address the theft of its material, but Narus said he wouldn\u2019t request restitution at sentencing. Intel, however, could request to be paid back, he said.\n\nGupta was allowed to remain out of custody pending sentencing.\n\nThe government said it doesn\u2019t consider Gupta a risk of not returning to court. Gupta has cooperated with the government and had an opportunity to study overseas, Narus said.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t return to face sentencing, Gupta could be arrested, extradited and lose a \u201cvery favorable resolution\u201d of the case, Narus told the judge.\n\nSeparately, Intel obtained a judge\u2019s order in mid-July 2021 barring Gupta from using or disclosing any of Intel\u2019s confidential information and requiring him to comply with his employment agreement. If he violated any of its terms or the judge\u2019s 2021 order, he was to pay Intel a minimum of $100,000. Also in 2021, Gupta settled a civil suit Intel filed against him, admitting to stealing the chipmaker\u2019s trade secrets.\n\n-- Maxine Bernstein covers federal court and criminal justice.

            "content": "The Wall Street Journal reports that two semiconductor chip makers\u2014Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and Broadcom\u2014are each weighing the possibility of buying part of Intel, another competitor in the space. Both Intel and the Trump administration are apparently interested in making a deal. But depending on what happens, it could be an example of one recipient of corporate welfare acquiring another.\n\nIntel was once a dominant force in personal computing\u2014perhaps the dominant force, designing and building the majority of all microprocessors used in both personal and commercial applications. But its fortunes have shifted since the early 2000s, owing to increased competition and its ill-fated decision not to take Apple's 2007 offer to supply chips for the first iPhone.\n\nIntel's stock lost over 60 percent of its value in 2024, making it the year's worst performer on the entire Nasdaq composite index, as competitors Nvidia and AMD soared. In November, the Dow Jones Industrial Average replaced Intel on its index with Nvidia, which Dow Jones officials felt was \"more representative\" of \"the semiconductors industry.\"\n\nThe deals that Broadcom and TSMC are apparently exploring would split Intel in two: Broadcom wants to take over Intel's design and marketing, while TSMC, separately, is eyeing its manufacturing facilities. (Broadcom \"would likely only do so if it finds a partner for Intel's manufacturing business,\" the Journal noted, while TSMC's bid would leave the design side alone.)\n\n\"The Trump administration has encouraged TSMC to do the deal,\" The New York Times reported last week. \"Howard Lutnick, President Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, has been involved in the conversations and considers them one of the most consequential challenges of his new job.\" (The Senate confirmed Lutnick to that position this week.)\n\nThe Journal separately confirmed the Trump administration's push for a TSMC deal but added, \"A White House official said the president was unlikely to support a deal that involved a foreign entity operating Intel's factories.\"\n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act, passed during Joe Biden's presidency, apportioned $39 billion in direct incentives for semiconductor manufacturing. On its way out the door, the Biden administration authorized numerous CHIPS Act grants, including $7.865 billion for Intel on promises that the company would spend tens of billions of dollars by the end of the decade building or expanding factories in four states.\n\nOfficials initially approved a grant for $8.5 billion but later trimmed the amount over fears about the company's viability: Intel had already scaled back the scope of its current projects, and as The New York Times reported, \"it has struggled to convince customers that it can match TSMC's technology.\"\n\nIntel lost $16.6 billion in the third quarter of 2024\u2014the biggest loss in its history\u2014and it would lose another $126 million the following quarter. (Intel stock rose 10 percent this week amid news of an impending acquisition.)\n\nNotably, as a condition of the CHIPS Act grant, \"Intel was required to maintain a majority share of its factories if they were spun off into a new entity,\" the Journal reports\u2014meaning an acquisition could void that deal.\n\nBut if TSMC acquired Intel's manufacturing facilities, the taxpayer won't be off the hook, because that company also benefited from a generous CHIPS Act grant.\n\n\"Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced\u2026up to $6.6 billion in direct funding\" and \"up to $5 billion of proposed loans\" to TSMC for its planned construction of three semiconductor fabrication facilities in Arizona, according to a November 2024 press release from the Department of Commerce.\n\nAs of this writing, TSMC has a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion; $6.6 billion in free government money is likely a nice perk, but the company could certainly afford to build the factories without it.\n\nIn fairness, Broadcom\u2014Intel's other potential bidder\u2014has received its share of corporate welfare, though none from the CHIPS Act.\n\nThere is plenty of upside if TSMC acquires Intel's manufacturing facilities: The company currently produces more than 90 percent of the world's most advanced semiconductors, and as recently as 2023, all production took place in Taiwan. With that nation under increasing threat from China, expanding to the United States would help secure the supply chain, benefiting both the business and its customers.\n\nBut TSMC has more than enough cash to do that on its own. Further, an acquisition would suggest that Intel was not a worthwhile recipient of billions of taxpayer dollars. The companies should make their own business decisions and leave the taxpayers out of it.",

            "content": "Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) rallied by close to 16% in Tuesday\u2019s trading, after a Wall Street Journal report indicated that Broadcom and TSMC were exploring potential bids for the storied chipmaker. Broadcom is reportedly interested in Intel\u2019s chip design businesses, while TSMC might seek a stake or full control of Intel\u2019s production facilities. No formal bids have been made yet, per the report. However, Intel\u2019s business has been showing signs of a potential recovery in recent months. The manufacturing processes the company had been betting its foundry operations on have reached crucial milestones, while the company\u2019s latest chips are also well reviewed. Moreover, the current Presidential administration\u2019s policies also bode well for U.S. based manufacturers like Intel. This begs the question, is this really the right time to sell out?\n\n18A Process Nodes Show Promise\n\nIntel has invested heavily in its foundry business in the U.S. over the last few years. While the unit has struggled, losing nearly $13 billion last year, Intel could be on the cusp of a turnaround. The Intel 3 process node has been in mass production for several months now and is used to make the Xeon 6 data center chips. Processors made using the latest Intel 18A process are being sampled with laptop manufacturers. Intel has talked up the 18A process in the past, indicating that it could help the company reclaim \u201cprocess leadership,\u201d which essentially means having the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing technology in the industry, after years of falling behind foundry behemoths TSMC and Samsung Electronics. Intel\u2019s process apparently has its advantages. While both the Intel 18A and TSMC\u2019s competing N2 process have gate-all-around transistors, Intel\u2019s fabrication process includes an additional innovation called backside power delivery, which touts improved efficiency and performance. Customers are also seeing higher confidence in Intel\u2019s process technology. Microsoft and Amazon have already contracted Intel to fabricate some of their custom chips, including AI accelerators, and this trend could pick up. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.\n\nTrump\u2019s U.S. Manufacturing Push\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been a major advocate of boosting U.S. manufacturing and this is expected to play in Intel\u2019s favor, considering its sizable fabrication footprint in the United States. The new Administration also wants AI chips to be manufactured domestically, with both design and production taking place in the U.S. to safeguard American AI technology and intellectual property. There\u2019s a possibility that this could result in considerable regulatory support via tariffs or other policies, driving more business to Intel\u2019s foundry unit as companies look to U.S. suppliers to avoid potential duties. This could drive more foundry business Intel\u2019s way. See how Trump and New Manufacturing Processes Help Intel Stock. By potentially handing over stake or control to TSMC, Intel shareholders could lose out on this upside.\n\nPositive Reviews For Latest Chips\n\nIntel\u2019s latest processor are also seeing better reviews. Preliminary benchmarks from PassMark show that Intel\u2019s new Arrow Lake-based Core Ultra 9 chip outperforms AMD\u2019s competing Ryzen 9 processor by about 7% in CPU benchmarks. Additionally, it is 34% faster than the previous generation i9-14900HX, with single-thread performance improving by 9%. Unlike Intel\u2019s AI-focused Lunar Lake chips, these new processors prioritize raw performance for demanding productivity and creative workloads. This launch comes at a relatively opportune time. Over the past two years or so, companies have likely under-invested in traditional CPU-based computing while aggressively securing GPUs, driven by FOMO, or the \u201cfear of missing out\u201d on securing the compute capacity needed for AI deployment. As CPU-related spending potentially rebounds, Intel might be better-positioned to benefit after years of market share losses in both the client and server markets.\n\nThe decrease in INTC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, 95% in 2023, and -60% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nFor long-term Intel shareholders who have been patient through years of underperformance and heavy investment in the foundry business, this may not be an opportune time to cash out. Handing over manufacturing to TSMC could mean missing out on a possible resurgence, while the chip business could also miss out on a potential reversal in the CPU market. Intel stock trades at about $27 per share currently or just a little over 22x consensus 2025 earnings, which is reasonable in our view. We value Intel stock at about $27 per share, roughly in line with the market price.

Investors, however, are skeptical, and shares slipped fractionally in Thursday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nIntel\u2019s 18A process has been the topic of discussion and speculation for some time now, but now, new reports are suggesting it is working out in a big way. In fact, new reports suggest that 18A is producing SRAM density on par with the N2 process at Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). That represents a major breakthrough, and should give Intel a real leg up going forward.\n\nOne of the biggest achievements in the 18A process, reports note, is the use of Backside Power Delivery (BSPDN), which, as the name suggests, moves power delivery functions to the back side of a wafer. That is an industry first, and is offering not only better efficiency in power, but also improvements in signal integrity, making for better overall product. That is just the news Intel will need to keep the market interested in its chip line.\n\nAltera Buyers\n\nBut 18A can only do so much so soon, and Intel is still likely hurting for cash. To that end, it is currently in talks with Silver Lake about selling off the stake in Altera. While there have been other buyers involved, expressing interest, Silver Lake is currently Intel\u2019s first choice.\n\nGiven that Silver Lake already has something of a reputation for reviving businesses\u2014it already did that job nicely with Dell Technologies (DELL)\u2014the notion of Silver Lake getting into the Altera business made a particular sense. Neither Silver Lake nor Intel, however, would comment, suggesting that the deal may be a ways off in coming, if it ever arrives to begin with.\n\nIs Intel a Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock based on one Buy, 27 Holds and five Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 40.77% loss in its share price over the past year, the average INTC price target of $22.67 per share implies 11.79% downside risk.\n\nSee more INTC analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

While the computer is positioned for use as a network attached storage (NAS) device, it\u2019s basically a general purpose computer that supports a lot of storage.\n\nAOOSTAR launched a model with a 6-watt Intel N100 quad-core processor last year, and then followed up with a higher-performance model featuring a 15-watt AMD Ryzen 7 5825U chip. Now the company is giving the original WTR Pro a slight spec bump: it\u2019s now available with an Intel N150 processor with support for slightly higher CPU and GPU speeds.\n\nThe newer chip is based on Intel\u2019s Twin Lake architecture and will most likely only offer a slight performance boost, if any. But since it\u2019s a newer processor it will probably be supported a little longer and a WTR Pro with the N150 chip only costs $15 more than an Intel N100 model, so I supposed it\u2019s nice to have the option.\n\nYou can pre-order a barebones AOOSTAR WTR Pro with an Intel N150 chip for $315 at the AOOSTAR store or for $339 from Amazon (which is generally a safer bet if you\u2019re looking for faster shipping and a better return policy).\n\nWhile other companies that sell NAS systems typically preinstall an operating system custom built for the purpose, AOOSTAR is a hardware company that hasn\u2019t dabbled into software. So the WTR Pro ships with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, but the computer should be capable of running a wide range of operating systems including TrueNAS, OpenMediaVault, or Unraid.\n\nIn addition to support for four 3.5 inch SATA drives and one M.2 SSD, the AOOSTAR WTR Pro features a single SODIMM slot with support for up to 32GB of DDR4-3200 memory and a port selection that includes:\n\n2 x 2.5 GbE LAN (Intel i226-V)\n\n1 x HDMI 2.1\n\n1 x DisplayPort\n\n1 x USB Type-C\n\n2 x USB 3.0 Type-A\n\n2 x USB 2.0 Type-A\n\n1 x 3.5mm audio\n\n1 x microSD card reader\n\n1 x DC power input\n\nThe system comes with a 120W (19V/6.32A) power supply and the WTR Pro measures 228 x 150 x 185mm (8.98\u2033 x 5.91\u2033 x 7.28\u2033).\n\nvia NotebookCheck\n\nSupport Liliputing Liliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links (if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on Amazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).

Following the political backing of the Trump administration, it is now disclosed via ISSCC sessions (via Ian Cutress) that both TSMC and Intel's cutting-edge processes are rivaling each other in SRAM densities, showing that the gap has been narrowed down significantly, at least in one of the important aspects.\n\nSat in @ieee_isscc session 29: SRAM 1st paper: $TSM 38 Mb/mm2 N2 HD SRAM\n\n2nd paper: $INTC 38 Mb/mm2 18A HD SRAM\n\n3rd paper: @Mediatek 3nm TCAM\n\n4th paper: @Synopsys 38 Mb/mm2 3nm HD SRAM It's a battle royale. \u2014 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5f. \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 (@IanCutress) February 19, 2025\n\nWe have discussed Intel's 18A in the past several times, but now might be one of the best times for an in-depth overview, given the hype around it. One of the more monumental achievements with Intel's 18A is the utilization of BSPDN (Backside Power Delivery), which is said to move the power delivery process to the backside of the wafer. This marks one of the industry's first implementations, and this mainly leads to improved power efficiency along with signal integrity, marking a massive breakthrough for the process in general.\n\nAn Intel factory employee holds a wafer with 3D stacked Foveros technology at an Intel fab in Hillsboro, Oregon, in December 2023. In February 2024, Intel Corporation launched Intel Foundry as the world\u2019s first systems foundry for the AI era, delivering leadership in technology, resiliency and sustainability. (Credit: Intel Corporation)\n\nIntel's 18A \"high-density\" versions are now said to report a macro bit density of 38.1 Mb/mm\u00b2, that too with the large array configuration. Different arrangements of SRAM cells will bring in varied densities, but overall, things are looking pretty optimistic for the 18A process. However, we certainly shouldn't conclude sentiments towards Intel's process right now, given that the actual test lies in chip production, and how yield rates turn out for Team Blue, since that would most likely be decisive.\n\nTSMC too has detailed its N2 process, revealing a 12% improvement in SRAM density due to integration of GAA technology, with high-performance SRAM seeing a phenomenal 18% improvement. The main improvement with N2 is the transition from traditional FinFET technology to a dedicated N2 \"nanosheet,\" which has brought in a lot more process customization, along with a more precise control compared to FinFET implementation.\n\nTSMC-Intel semiconductor race is pretty much on, and it looks like the competition is going to get a lot more fiercer, but yet again, the important factor is how the processes will turn out once they enter the supply chain.",

The semiconductor company's share price was down 5.6% as of noon ET and had been down as much as 7% earlier in today's trading.\n\nIntel's pullback comes on the heels of a 16% jump for the stock in yesterday's trading following a report that the company could sell its Altera division and other acquisition speculation. But investors are weighing the outlook on potential sale scenarios for Intel, and the company's share price is also being pushed lower due to tariff news.\n\nIntel stock cools off after yesterday's big rally\n\nThe stock has been gaining ground lately amid reports that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (or TSMC) and Broadcom are potentially interested in taking over different parts of the company. While Broadcom would potentially be buying Intel's chip design business, TSMC would be buying the chip fabrication unit or operating it through a joint venture with Intel.\n\nThe company's stock also got a boost yesterday after Bloomberg reported that Silver Lake Management had nearly completed a deal to buy Intel's Altera division, which focuses on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips. But investors are cooling a bit on the acquisition speculation today, with some coverage suggesting that the sale of Intel's design business could face roadblocks due to shared licensing agreements with Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nThe share price is also facing downward pressure due to news that the Trump administration is considering a new 25% tariff on a wide range of foreign goods including semiconductors. Intel manufactures many of its own chips, but the company still relies on TSMC for the manufacturing of some of its most advanced processors. As a result, that means Intel would likely be subject to new tariffs.\n\nWhat comes next for Intel?\n\nThe company appears to be on the verge of some major structural changes. It's too early to say exactly how potential spinoffs, acquisitions, or joint ventures might shake out, but it's possible that upcoming deals will wind up unlocking substantial value for shareholders.\n\nIntel's business has struggled in recent years as its chips have lost market share to competitors in key categories, and losses from its foundry operations have mounted. But the company has resources that could be valuable to other semiconductor companies and broader U.S. strategic interests.",

Intel's stock closed on Friday at $23.60, down roughly 50% over the past year. The stock has crashed 65% in the past five years to a market cap of $102 billion.\n\nUsing more robust projections of financial performance for each business, Lipacis estimates Intel could be worth $237 billion or $54.18 a share.\n\nA path to a deal could be tough, Lipacis said.\n\n\"Depending on how a deal is structured, it might require regulatory approval from countries around the world, including China. Also, Intel has historically designed its factories to make x86 CPUs, so it is not clear if Intel's factories would be able to make external chips efficiently with its current physical plant.

Intel now offers a whole-vehicle platform, including high-performance compute, discrete graphics, artificial intelligence (AI), power management and zonal controller solutions alongside the Intel\u00ae Automotive Virtual Design Environment (VDE) co-developed with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Intel\u2019s approach addresses automakers\u2019 cost and performance scalability challenges, enabling faster, more efficient and more profitable SDV development and deployment.\n\nAt CES on Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2025, Intel introduced the availability of the Adaptive Control Unit (ACU), designed for electric vehicle (EV) power trains and zonal controller applications. The ACU U310 is a new kind of processing unit that supports the consolidation of multiple real-time, safety-critical and cybersecure functions, applications and domains (X-in-1) into a single chip. (Credit: Intel Corporation)\n\n\u201cIntel automotive is bringing innovative solutions that reduce cost in the SDV revolution. Our whole-vehicle approach, combined with cloud integration, delivers a complete solution that drives down total cost of development and deployment while empowering automakers to build the future of mobility faster, more efficiently and more profitably.\u201d\n\n-- Jack Weast, Intel Fellow, vice president and general manager of Intel Automotive\n\nWhy a Whole-Vehicle Platform Matters: Intel\u2019s whole-vehicle platform reduces inefficiencies of traditional fragmented approaches to vehicle architectures. By optimizing the entire vehicle\u2019s electrical/electronic architecture, Intel drives significant cost reductions and performance improvements.\n\nSupporting this platform, Intel introduced the availability of the Adaptive Control Unit (ACU), designed for electric vehicle (EV) power trains and zonal controller applications.\n\nAbout the Adaptive Control Unit: The ACU U310 is a new kind of processing unit that supports the consolidation of multiple real-time, safety-critical and cybersecure functions, applications and domains (X-in-1) into a single chip. Traditional time and sequential processing-based micro and zonal controllers struggle to handle multiple workloads due to limited deterministic processing capabilities. In contrast, Intel\u2019s new family of ACU devices integrates a flexible logic area that offloads real-time control algorithms from the CPU cores, ensuring reliable performance, freedom from interference (FFI) and deterministic data delivery even when consolidating multiple microcontroller workloads into a single zonal MCU. This dual-brain approach enables greater workload consolidation, lowers cost, and enhances safety, cybersecurity and performance.\n\nWhen used in an electric vehicle power train, the ACU U310 supports advanced algorithmic solutions that reduce vehicle energy demand from the battery, automatically adapting high voltage and control frequencies to individual driver styles and road conditions. The ACU reduces cost per kilowatt and enhances energy efficiency, allowing the vehicle to reclaim up to 40 percent of the power train system energy losses, delivering a 3% to 5% efficiency boost during the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP). This translates to increased range, faster charging and a more responsive driving experience while significantly reducing per-vehicle bill of materials (BOM), electric motor size and battery costs compared to traditional approaches.\n\nStellantis Motorsports selected Intel as a key technology partner and adopting the Adaptive Control technology into its next-generation inverter control for enhanced performance and efficiency in competitive racing environments. In this implementation, the Intel technology will control the electric motor and recover energy during braking phases. The inverter plays a crucial role during a Formula E race, where any gain in efficiency is transformed into a precious competitive advantage.\n\nKarma Automotive announced support for Intel\u2019s ACU, showcasing an Intel co-branded inverter featuring Optimal Pulse Pattern control algorithms to improve efficiency and enable four unique driving profiles, including innovative features like Torque Ripple Reduction and Range Boost.\n\nThe ACU\u2019s programmability allows it to serve as a first-of-its-kind software-defined zonal controller, adapting to different vehicle topologies and applications. This flexibility streamlines the transition to software-defined vehicles, simplifies supply chains and reduces the complexity of the vehicle BOM.\n\nHow Next-Gen Architecture is Enhanced with AI Inside: Building on Intel\u2019s first-generation AI-enhanced SDV system-on-chips (SoCs), Intel announced the upcoming second-generation Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 B-series Graphics for Automotive set for production by the end of 2025. This solution provides the high-performance compute needed for more advanced in-vehicle AI workloads, next-generation human-machine interface (HMI) engines, and immersive in-vehicle experiences and AAA PC gaming. Paired with an Intel AI-enhanced SDV SoC, it delivers scalable performance for complex AI tasks, supported by the vast Intel AI ecosystem.\n\nHow Intel and AWS Revolutionize Automotive Software Development: Intel and AWS introduced the Intel Automotive Virtual Development Environment on AWS, a groundbreaking approach that ensures true hardware and software parity from cloud to car. This new offering addresses challenges throughout the vehicle development life cycle, enabling engineers to seamlessly switch between virtual and physical hardware setups. It integrates Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae processor-based Amazon EC2 instances and, for the first time, incorporates Intel\u2019s Automotive SDV SoCs within the AWS environment, eliminating the need for expensive electronic control unit (ECU) simulators or developer boards. This collaboration provides a unified solution that accelerates innovation, reduces R&D costs and speeds time-to-market.\n\nAbout Intel\u2019s System-Level Advantage: Intel's whole-vehicle approach delivers numerous benefits to automakers, including cost reductions, enhanced vehicle performance, streamlined development, improved energy efficiency, seamless AI integration and faster time-to-market \u2013 all supported by Intel\u2019s globally balanced supply chain.\n\nMore: Intel at CES 2025 | Intel Auto Keynote Explores Software-Defined Future (Video)\n\nAbout Intel\n\nIntel (Nasdaq: INTC) is an industry leader, creating world-changing technology that enables global progress and enriches lives.

            "content": "Intel has faced severe financial and execution woes over the past couple of years, leading to all types of speculation about the future of the company, with the most recent rumors pointing to Broadcom's interest in taking over Intel's product business, as well as an alleged U.S. government intention to make TSMC run Intel Foundry manufacturing operations in a joint venture between Intel and the Taiwanese contract chipmaker. But there is an obstacle that many people overlook: the broad cross-licensing agreement between Intel and AMD, as observed by Digits-to-Dollars.\n\nAMD and Intel have a broad cross-licensing agreement (in fact, multiple agreements, with the most recent signed in 2009) that allows both companies to use each other's patents while preventing lawsuits over possible infringements. This covers their entire portfolios, including CPUs, GPUs, and other innovations. AMD can produce x86-based processors with Intel's instruction set extensions, while Intel can incorporate AMD's innovations into its own CPUs.\n\nHowever, neither can develop processors that work with the other's sockets or motherboards., and the agreement has strict conditions for termination. If either company merges, is acquired, or enters a joint venture that alters ownership, the deal ends immediately. In the event of one of these triggers, the two companies must negotiate a new licensing arrangement.\n\nAlthough some market observers tie the AMD and Intel cross-licensing agreement directly to the 1976 agreement concerning the x86 instruction set architecture (ISA), this is not the case. The agreements include a variety of extensions to x86 (such as SSE and AVX) as well as other innovations that are inseparable parts of today's CPUs. While it is possible to build an x86 CPU without AVX, SSE, or other extensions, such processors will not be able to compete against modern counterparts. Thus, losing the license could be devastating to both AMD and Intel.\n\nIn addition to the x86 ISA and extensions, the broad cross-licensing agreement between the two companies covers other technologies, including GPUs, DPUs, and FPGAs. Therefore, if the agreement were terminated, it would affect virtually all of AMD and Intel\u2019s products, necessitating a renegotiation of the cross-licensing agreement.\n\nCompanies in the high-tech industry tend to sign broad cross-licensing agreements, but a big question is whether AMD is actually interested in signing such an agreement with Broadcom. Historically, Broadcom was primarily known for networking solutions and wireless technologies, but today the company is a major player in the storage, cybersecurity, and infrastructure software markets. Perhaps more importantly, it has emerged as a leading developer of custom AI processors, collaborating with virtually all major cloud service providers and hyperscalers. Acquiring CPU capabilities would make Broadcom a formidable competitor for AMD. At present, Broadcom, armed with both CPUs and AI processors, poses a greater competitive threat to AMD than Intel, the latter of which lacks a clear AI strategy.\n\nWhile Digits-to-Dollars suggests that AMD could ask Broadcom to help counter Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the AI market by creating \"AMD-friendly\" networking interfaces and connectivity solutions, Broadcom\u2019s priority appears to be strengthening its position in the data center market, where it currently lacks CPUs. Once the company acquires a general-purpose data center processor business \u2014 further strengthened by Intel's large client PC processor volumes \u2014 it will likely focus on developing its own AI data center platform consisting of CPUs and ASICs, rather than assisting AMD in competing with Nvidia. Of course, an industry-standard platform centered around open standards like Ultra Ethernet could make life easier for both AMD and Broadcom in their fight against Nvidia. However, competing with Broadcom will be more challenging for AMD than competing with Intel.",

Needless to say, it was natural for Intel employees to react to the information, too. Joseph Bonetti, Principal Engineering Program Manager at Intel Corp., wrote his personal opinion in a LinkedIn post that the company is about to reclaim its process technology lead and gain customers among fabless chipmakers in the coming years, so handing TSMC control of Intel's manufacturing would be counterproductive (Edit: the post has now been deleted).\n\n\"Intel Leaders, Intel Board, Trump Administration, please do not sell out and/or give control of Intel Foundry to TSMC, just as Intel is taking a technical lead and getting out of first gear. This would be a horrible, demoralizing mistake,\" wrote Bonetti.\n\nContrary to reports suggesting it lags behind a key competitor, Bonetti argues, Intel is making significant advancements in semiconductor manufacturing. The company's latest fabrication process, Intel 3, is already used to make Xeon 6 data center processors, while the company's next-generation Intel 18A is nearing completion and is expected to be used to make Panther Lake processors for client PCs later this year. Meanwhile, TSMC's equivalent process technology \u2014 N2 (2nm-class) \u2014 will only enter mass production phase in late 2025.\n\nIntel is also ahead with its High-NA EUV initiatives. The company acquired two ASML Twinscan EXE machines and is the only chipmaker that has experience working with such tools. Despite financial struggles, Intel Foundry is poised to prove itself with major partners, which makes any potential deal that hands control to a rival a major strategic error.\n\nMany claims in recent reports misrepresent Intel's progress, stresses Bonetti. Some suggest TSMC engineers are needed to get Intel's latest process technologies to work, but Intel 3 has been in mass production for months, and Panther Lake, made on Intel 18A, is already sampling with laptop manufacturers.\n\nIntel 18A and TSMC N2 both introduce gate-all-around transistors, but Intel's fabrication process includes an additional breakthrough: backside power delivery, which promises to improve efficiency and performance and give Intel's products an edge over those made by TSMC.\n\nThe Intel engineer reckons that Intel Foundry is currently unprofitable due to massive investments in facilities and equipment, and it has yet to win contracts from major external customers. However, early adoption by Microsoft and Amazon signals confidence in Intel's capabilities. If these efforts succeed, more industry leaders may shift production. To that end, ceding control of Intel Foundry to TSMC would neutralize Intel as a competitor and harm U.S. leadership in the semiconductor industry.",

Arizona Republic\n\nIntel Corp., a major employer in Arizona, is considering splitting its company after recent financial struggles, according to news reports.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Intel may sell its manufacturing facilities to TSMC and its chip-design business to Broadcom.\n\nTSMC, an Intel competitor, has a growing presence in Arizona with a massive chip manufacturing facility in north Phoenix.\n\nIntel Corp., long one of Arizona\u2019s technology juggernauts with about 12,000 workers in the state, could face a vastly different future because of its recent financial struggles.\n\nThe storied Silicon Valley semiconductor company, with operations in Chandler, might be split in two, according to a Wall Street Journal report Feb. 15 that cited unnamed sources.\n\nIntel\u2019s manufacturing or \"foundry\" facilities are said to be of interest to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which has started to produce chips at a massive complex in north Phoenix, while Intel\u2019s chip-design business could be purchased by another tech giant, Broadcom, according to the report.\n\nBroadcom and TSMC aren't working together, according to the Wall Street Journal, which also questioned whether the Trump administration might object to a foreign company, TSMC, owning a sizable piece of Intel, for national security or economic-competitive reasons.\n\nBoth Intel and TSMC are among Arizona\u2019s largest employers and together form the backbone of the state\u2019s technology sector. The two companies also have been among the largest recipients of funding under the CHIPS and Science Act, with Intel receiving federal grants of $7.9 billion, with about $3.9 billion for its Arizona operation, and TSMC getting $6.6 billion for its complex in north Phoenix.\n\nBut Intel has fallen on tough times, underscored by an $18.8 billion loss in 2024 and a more than 50% slide in its stock price over the past two months. Neither Intel nor TSMC responded to queries about the Journal report.\n\nHere's what we know about other issues pertinent to this possible development.\n\nBusiness: As tariffs become more common, Arizona businesses seek foreign trade zones for tax relief\n\nHow did Intel grow?\n\nFounded in 1968 in California\u2019s Silicon Valley by semiconductor entrepreneurs Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, Intel achieved several notable successes in the following decades, with product expansions, many new customers and increasingly global operations. For example, Intel was selected to supply processors for IBM personal computers in 1981, then added Compaq personal computers shortly after that, with a growing array of other notable customers, from Ford Motor to the federal government. The company topped $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 1983.\n\nAn \u201cIntel inside\u201d advertising campaign in the 1990s raised awareness about the company and educated the public about its products and their importance to broader technology developments.\n\nCEO Andy Grove was named Time\u2019s \u201cman of the year\u201d in 1997, and Intel stock was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the grouping of 30 corporate heavyweights, in 1999. Longtime Arizonan Craig Barrett served as an Intel CEO and chairman in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nIntel CEO explains need for Chandler semiconductor factory expansion The factory expansion is heralded as the largest private economic development investment in Arizona's history. Intel Corp.\n\nWhat went wrong for Intel?\n\nA number of factors have played a role. Intel has faced problems that include manufacturing delays, quality-control issues, marketing errors, expensive acquisitions that didn\u2019t work out, executive-management turnover and more in a highly competitive industry where leadership ebbs and flows.\n\nAccording to Informa TechTarget, some of the missed or squandered opportunities for Intel included nixing an early invitation to supply processors for Apple when the company\u2019s iPhones were getting started around 20 years ago and declining an opportunity to invest in OpenAI. Meanwhile, Intel paid $7.7 billion for electronic security company McAfee in 2010 and $15 billion for Israel's Mobileye in 2017, only to spin off the two companies several years after their respective acquisitions.\n\nCompetition also has intensified from rivals such as AMD and TSMC, which was founded about two decades after Intel and, unlike the other, focuses on making chips for other companies. Intel was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in November, confirming a decline that had been underway for years. The following month, CEO Pat Gelsinger stepped down.\n\nWhat\u2019s Intel\u2019s history in Arizona?\n\nIn 1980, Intel began operations in Chandler, which remains the home of two large complexes. Employees there have been engaged in research and development, manufacturing, the packaging of semiconductors into devices that protect and connect them, and more. Intel\u2019s Chandler campus handles company business activities worldwide while its Ocotillo campus, also in Chandler, focuses on high-volume manufacturing of microprocessors.\n\nThe Chandler facilities have been expanded over the years, to where Intel recently counted 13,000 Arizona employees before attrition, recent layoffs and other factors took a bite. The Arizona complexes generated national attention when President Joe Biden visited last March with much fanfare to announce Intel\u2019s pending receipt of $8.5 billion in CHIPS and Science Act grants. That was later reduced to $7.9 billion \u2014 still one of the largest sources of funding under the legislation aimed at reviving U.S. leadership in semiconductors.\n\nIntel ranked as the 10th largest nongovernmental employer in Arizona with about 12,000 workers in the state, according to a special Arizona Republic report last September, though that was down from 13,000 Arizona employees the prior year.\n\nWhat has happened to Intel lately, financially?\n\nAs noted, the company reported poor performance in 2024, posting a loss of $18.8 billion on revenue of $53.1 billion. Just two years earlier, in 2022, Intel had earned $8 billion on revenue of $63.1 billion.\n\nReflecting the dismal news, Intel\u2019s shares have lost more than half of their value since just before Christmas. The company\u2019s worth or stock market capitalization still approximates $100 billion, but that's nowhere near the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d tech stocks including Apple, Google, Meta and Nvidia \u2014 each now worth more than $1 trillion.\n\nDoesn\u2019t TSMC also have a notable presence in Arizona?\n\nYes. After years of discussions with economic development officials, the company announced an initial commitment to invest $12 billion in north Phoenix, later expanding that to $65 billion \u2014the inflation-adjusted equivalent of more than 90 Chase Fields, the downtown home of the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Phoenix campus marked TSMC\u2019s largest stake in the U.S., and the facility is now producing some of the smallest and most technologically advanced chips on U.S. soil. The TSMC campus, then entirely under construction, hosted a Biden visit in 2022.\n\nReach the reporter at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com.",

Even before that, in September, Qualcomm also inquired about a potential sale.\n\nAny deal for Intel would be highly scrutinized by the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, America\u2019s two antitrust authorities, but also potentially considered for any national security ramifications, considering chip independence is a strategic priority for the US.\n\nFor now, Intel is still standing, but it very may be carved up in the months and years to come.",

Recent rumors suggest that the \"blue team\" is quietly developing the next-generation Celestial GPU, which promises to be a formidable rival to Nvidia and AMD.\n\nLeaked sources indicate that the Arc Celestial will be built on the brand-new Xe3P architecture, rather than the previous Xe3. Notably, Intel may manufacture Celestial chips in-house using its internal INTC process instead of relying on TSMC, as it has in the past. This shift would allow Intel to have greater control over chip quality and supply while reducing dependence on external partners.\n\nThe Xe3P architecture is expected to deliver superior performance and improved power efficiency compared to previous generations. Additionally, new technologies such as AI-powered enhancements, advanced data processing, and frame generation could be integrated, unlocking significant potential for Intel\u2019s next-gen graphics cards.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia continues to dominate the GPU market, while AMD is working to close the gap. Although Intel's mid-range Battlemage GPUs have provided consumers with more choices, they have yet to pose a serious threat to the two industry giants.\n\nCould Celestial be Intel\u2019s secret weapon to dethrone Nvidia?

(TSM) are considering bids for parts of the embattled chipmaker.\n\nAccording to the report, Broadcom has been looking into Intel\u2019s chip-design and marketing business, while contract chipmaker TSMC has mulled taking over some or all of Intel\u2019s chip plants as part of an investor consortium or another structure.\n\nIntel shares surged more than 20% last week after Vice President JD Vance said at a recent AI conference in Paris that the Trump administration would take steps to ensure AI chips are designed and manufactured in the U.S, a move that could benefit Intel\u2019s foundry business that makes chips for third parties.\n\nSentiment surrounding the stock received a further boost last week on speculation that the company may partner with TSMC to make chips in the U.S. Despite last week\u2019s gains, Intel shares have lost nearly half their value over the past year amid concerns about the chipmaker\u2019s uncertain turnaround plan and inability to capture more of the lucrative AI silicon market.\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at Intel\u2019s chart and apply technical analysis to identify key price levels that investors may be watching out for.\n\nPotential Rectangle Pattern Carving Chart Bottom\n\nSince gapping sharply lower in early August last year, Intel shares have remained mostly rangebound, potentially carving out a rectangle bottoming pattern.\n\nThis month, the stock has rallied towards the top of the rangebound period on above-average volume, though the closely watched 200-day moving average (MA) has provided resistance in recent trading sessions.\n\nMeanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) sits just below the 70 threshold, confirming bullish momentum, setting the stage for positive price action to continue this week.\n\nLet\u2019s identify four key overhead areas on Intel\u2019s chart where the shares could face selling pressure and also point out a major support level worth monitoring if the stock reverses course.\n\nKey Overhead Areas to Watch\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s worth keeping track of the $26 area. This location, currenting sitting just above the 200-day MA, may provide overhead resistance near the rectangle pattern\u2019s top trendline.\n\nA decisive breakout above this level could see the shares climb to around $32. Investors who have bought shares at lower prices may look for exit points in this region near a trendline that connects a range of comparable trading levels on the chart between April 2023 and July last year.\n\nBuying above this level may trigger a move up to the $37 area. The shares could encounter resistance in this location near a horizontal line the links multiple peaks on the chart from August 2023 and July last year.\n\nA longer-term uptrend opens the door for a move up to around $45, an area where investors may look to lock in profits near a range of peaks and troughs that formed on the chart between November 2023 and March 2024.\n\nMajor Support Level to Monitor\n\nIf Intel\u2019s share price reverses, investors should keep a close eye on the $19 level.

Nothing has been inked, but Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) both are in the early stages of proposing potential deals, according to The Wall Street Journal. Broadcom could potentially seek a deal for Intel\u2019s chip design assets, while TSMC eyes its manufacturing capabilities.\n\nIntel interim executive chairman allegedly met with buyers, government\n\nBroadcom and TSMC are not officially working together, and any plans either company has for deals with Intel are in preliminary stages, The Wall Street Journal said. However, Intel\u2019s Interim Executive Chairman Frank Yeary has allegedly met with potential buyers and Trump administration officials.\n\nTSMC\u2019s involvement in particular would need to take into account Intel\u2019s U.S. national security relationships. Intel was the largest recipient of the U.S. Chips Act of 2022, which gave up to $7.9 billion in grants to U.S.-based factory projects. Reception of that money makes Intel subject to regulations that say the company must own a majority share of its factories if they are sold off or spun out.\n\nYeary is allegedly focused on getting the maximum value for shareholders.\n\nThe two corporations could potentially buy and split Intel; in that case, one division could focus on manufacturing and one on design. Intel\u2019s factories already operate somewhat independently; since 2022, they have taken orders from outside customers and inside the house at equal priority. Intel reports finances from the manufacturing division separately and is prepared to assign a manufacturing subsidiary its own board of directors, The Wall Street Journal said.\n\nIntel\u2019s board of directors has been searching for a new CEO since Pete Gelsinger stepped down from that role in December 2024.\n\nSEE: Arm may shift from only licensing designs to having brand-name chips manufactured by TSMC.\n\nIntel\u2019s financial performance didn\u2019t please the board in the last few years\n\nGelsinger left Intel without completing his turnaround plan, which board directors found was not benefitting the company.\n\nIntel used to be a giant in the CPU industry, but the AI boom and a failure to strategize in a way that benefits from current trends have led to it struggling. Intel is unusual among its rivals in that it has not focused solely on either manufacturing or designing chips; as such, it has seen its chip-making endeavors eclipsed by TSMC.\n\nIntel also had some struggles with quality in 2024. Three years ago, Intel\u2019s value was twice what it was in September 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIt dropped from first to second on Gartner\u2019s list of top global semiconductor vendors by revenue growth. As its place in the rankings indicated, Intel is still a major player, however. Microsoft chose Intel chips for its current-gen Surface Laptop 7 and Surface Pro 11.",

After forcing CEO Pat Gelsinger out in December, there have been questions about whether Intel would sell the foundry business outright and just seek to be a chip designer.\n\nHowever, that asset base also makes Intel attractive at a time when U.S. policy is to move chip production back to the U.S.\n\nThat logic ties into the two primary factors lifting Intel stock this week. First, rumors started circulating that TSMC, the world's biggest chip foundry, could form some kind of joint venture with Intel to help it manufacture advanced chips in the U.S. These rumors don't seem to have come from either company, and instead evolved in the media based on the federal government's desire to make the U.S. a hub of chip manufacturing.\n\nRelatedly, the stock also got a jolt after Vice President JD Vance said that the Trump administration would \"ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the U.S. with American designed and manufactured chips.\"\n\nInvestors interpreted that as a good sign for Intel.\n\nIs Intel's foundry biz an asset or an albatross?\n\nIntel is losing billions of dollars a year, but the company is the biggest U.S. chip manufacturer, giving it a possible advantage at a time when the federal government wants to bring chip production home.\n\nMaking that policy a reality has so far proven harder than expected, and some lawmakers have cast doubt on whether it's wise for the U.S. to pour billions into the struggling company through the CHIPS Act.\n\nAt this point, this week's gains seem to be mostly based on conjecture, but it does show the potential for the foundry business to drive a recovery in the stock.

Some analysts believe that Trump will demand that TSMC work out a transaction that results in its acquisition of a stake in Intel Foundry Services which is expected to match TSMC and Samsung Foundry with its 18A node (1.8nm) which will start mass production later this year. The other two foundries will begin mass production at 2nm this year.\n\n\n\nReceive the latest mobile news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president would be happy to see TSMC involved with Intel because the former could help Intel get business for its foundry from top chip designers like Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and other TSMC clients. Despite all of the reasons why TSMC might be seriously looking to buy part of Intel's foundry business, many analysts say that TSMC has no interest in Intel's fabs. Most of Intel's advanced chips are produced in the U.S. which is why TSMC taking a stake in Intel Foundry Services is so important to the administration's goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTSMC's Arizona fabs are not really the answer for the U.S. right now since volume at the 3nm and 5nm nodes is less than 20% of the volume produced in Taiwan at those nodes. And with the fabs in Arizona about to fall two process nodes behind the leading edge, the Arizona facilities will need to pick up more volume in order to give the U.S. the feeling of being self-sufficient in advanced chip production.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as Intel needs TSMC to attract big-name clients for its Foundry Services, the Trump administration needs Intel to help it take over leadership in supplying cutting-edge chips for military use. At this point, most analysts don't expect to see TSMC's interest in Intel getting past the rumor stage.\n\n",

            "content": "Broadcom is reportedly contemplating a play for Intel.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Broadcom has closely examined Intel\u2019s chip design and marketing businesses with a view to a possible acquisition, conditional upon someone else taking on Intel\u2019s foundry business.\n\nBroadcom already has a very substantial chip design business but outsources manufacturing. It\u2019s hard to imagine the company would change that strategy.\n\nThe Hock Tan-led company also has a history of acquiring outfits whose products are so deeply embedded in enterprise IT stacks that users are unlikely to replace them.\n\nIntel, like past Broadcom acquisitions VMware and CA Technologies, meets that description as its Xeon processors dominate many datacenters. Plenty of enterprises have built their tech stacks on the x86 architecture and the Xeon ecosystem. Few will be able to adopt a replacement in a hurry.\n\nIntel also offers Broadcom another thing it covets: Subscription revenue.\n\nReaders may recall that in 2022 Chipzilla introduced \u201csoftware-defined silicon\u201d in the form of a scheme called \u201cIntel on Demand\u201d that made it possible to activate features of Xeon processors such as software guard extensions or RAID capabilities upon payment of one-off additional fees. Intel On Demand also allows consumption-based pricing, an idea HPE has adopted in its GreenLake IT-as-a-service offering.\n\nThe Register fancies Broadcom would make Intel on Demand a more prominent feature of its processors under its business model that Netflix, in an unflattering assessment of the company filed in a lawsuit, described as \u201cBuy. Chop up. Sell off. Raise prices. Rinse. Repeat.\u201d\n\nThe \u201craise prices\u201d part of that model would not be sensible for Intel\u2019s desktop chips, which are already struggling to compete on features and price with product from AMD and Qualcomm. But the \u201cChop up. Sell off.\u201d tactics could come into play if Broadcom decides it would rather not contest the drooping PC market.\n\nIntel\u2019s current market capitalization is just over $100 billion, and Broadcom would pay less for its chip design arm alone \u2013 perhaps a smaller sum than the $61 billion it paid for VMware.\n\nThat deal saw Broadcom cut costs, improve margins and boost profits to a greater extent than it initially thought possible, perhaps giving the company confidence its acquisition methodologies are sufficiently efficient it could swallow Intel. Increasing acquisition costs for VMware software and associated services was a big contributor to that achievement.\n\nOther speculation about the semiconductor giant\u2019s fate includes the possibility its fabrication business could be sold to a consortium that includes Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. Any sale of Intel\u2019s chip factories would need regulatory approval in many jurisdictions. A deal could prove especially contentious in Washington, where the Trump administration has signalled its displeasure with the CHIPS Act that funnelled billions to Intel and other chipmakers to fund their build of semiconductor fabs in the USA.\n\nNvidia disarms, a bit\n\nIn other semiconductor ownership news, a Valentines Day filing from Nvidia reveals the AI hardware giant sold 44 percent of its shares in chip designer Arm.\n\nNvidia packs its Grace superchips full of Arm CPUs and is rumoured to be creating an Arm-based PC processor, so selling some shares is not necessarily an indication of displeasure with the UK-based chip design firm. It\u2019s more likely just Nvidia rebalancing its asset portfolio, evidence of which can be seen in the fact the same filing records it sold all its shares in three other companies, and picked up its first stakes in datacenter operator Applied Digital and an outfit called Recursion Pharmaceuticals. \u00ae",

Bloomberg reported on Friday that TSMC\u2019s focus may be on Intel\u2019s fabrication plants, or fabs for short, in the United States.\n\nIntel, Broadcom and TSMC did not respond to requests for comment Sunday morning.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and The New York Times reported that this deal could be accomplished through a consortium model. This could involve other chip designers gaining a stake in Intel\u2019s manufacturing business, according to Bloomberg. The New York Times said a consortium deal could also include private equity firms.\n\nAll three news publications reported that TSMC\u2014which is Intel Foundry\u2019s top competitor as a contract chipmaker with advanced capabilities\u2014has sought the potential deal at the encouragement of the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, a White House official told The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg that President Trump would likely not support a foreign company owning Intel\u2019s factories.\n\nThe New York Times reported Friday that Intel\u2019s interim executive chairman, Frank Yeary, has spoken with the Trump administration and TSMC leaders about the deal, which would separate Intel\u2019s chip manufacturing business from its chip design business.\n\nWhile The New York Times said the deal would be limited to Intel\u2019s U.S. fabs, it could also include the semiconductor giant\u2019s factories in other countries, like Ireland and Israel.\n\nIntel has been the source of acquisition rumors for several months in light of growing financial challenges that prompted the semiconductor giant last August to announce a $10 billion cost-cutting plan that resulted in the company slashing more than 15,000 jobs.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s mounting challenges, combined with the rumored acquisition interest, have raised questions about whether Intel would consider breaking up its chip manufacturing and chip design businesses into separate companies.\n\nAt an investor conference in December, interim Intel co-CEO David Zinsner, who is also the company\u2019s CFO, said the idea is a possibility: \u201cDoes it ever fully separate? I think that's an open question for another day.\u201d\n\nEven before acquisition rumors began to pop up, Intel had taken steps to internally separate its chip manufacturing business, Intel Foundry, from its chip design business, which is now known as Intel Products and led by Intel\u2019s other interim co-CEO, Michelle Johnston Holthaus.\n\nAt the same investor conference two months ago, Zinsner referenced Intel\u2019s move to turn Intel Foundry into an independent subsidiary, saying that the business was getting its own operational board and enterprise resource planning system.\n\n\u201cThat's already in flight. That's going to happen, and it\u2019s just a matter of time at this point that we lock in the milestones associated with creating that separation,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Edit 2/16/2024: The list of supported processors we reference in this article is for new OEM systems. However, Microsoft also references this same list on its minimum system requirements for Windows 11 page (expanding the 'Processors/CPUs' section has a link to Microsoft's \"list of approved CPUs,\" which is the same list as referenced below.) We are following up with Microsoft for clarification but have added mention of the OEM systems below.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has published its latest Windows 11 processor support lists for new OEM systems. The latest version of the OS, Windows 11 version 24H2, now includes official support for some of the newest Intel chips such as Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake Core Ultra 200 parts. However, we are surprised to see that Intel's 8th, 9th, and 10th Gen processors are no longer officially supported on the list for new OEM systems. The decision may be related to Intel's move of 7th-10th Gen iGPUs to a legacy support model in December.\n\nThough Windows 11 24H2 has been pushed to consumers for several months already, Microsoft has just released the first official CPU support lists on its Hardware Developer site (the same as linked to the overall Windows 11 minimum requirements). When the first version of Windows 11 went official users were surprised to see many serviceable Intel CPUs, the 7th Gen Kaby Lake series and older, left unsupported. Now we appear to be seeing Intel's 8th, 9th, and 10th Gen processors meeting the same fate.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nCutting support for Intel processors launched as recently as 2020 (10th Gen Comet Lake), seems rather drastic. The Core i9-10900K with 10C/20T and a boost as high as 5.3 GHz seems far too virile to be put to pasture when a Celeron 6305 2C/2T Tiger Lake chip (also launched in 2020), for example, makes the Windows 11 version 24H2 official support list.\n\nMicrosoft doesn't explain its CPU support decisions on the linked page. All it really says is that, going forward, \"subsequently released and future generations of processors which meet the same principles will be considered as supported, even if not explicitly listed.\" Moreover, it doesn't mention the dropping of support for Intel's 8th 9th, and 10th Gen processors in the preamble to the Windows 11 version 24H2 list.\n\nIntel found holding the smoking gun?\n\nThe absence of explanation might give some hope that all the Intel 8th, 9th, and 10th Gen processors missing from the support list could be some kind of clerical error. However, the dropping of support of these particular Intel CPUs tallies with Intel's moving of \"7th - 10th Gen Intel Processor Graphics and related Intel Atom, Pentium, and Celeron processor graphics to a legacy software support model.\" Intel announced this change quite recently, in December 2024.\n\nIf this is the reason for omitting these chips from the CPU support list, we have to wonder whether an 8th Gen chip, for example, with a modern discrete GPU will sail past any 'unsupported hardware' OS upgrade barriers.\n\nWindows 11 version 24H2 supported AMD processors\n\nMeanwhile, folk rocking PC systems running AMD processors will see that Ryzen 8000 chips have been added to the official Windows 11 support list (for 24H2) for the first time. We noticed that some mobile chips were misnamed, like the Ryzen 7 Pro 8945HS, which should be the Ryzen 9 Pro 8945HS. Also, the non-Pro SKU seems to be missing from the list, but these are likely oversights.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

There are no signs of any Ryzen 9000 CPUs, nor popular chips like the Ryzen AI 9 370 HX on the new list. Remember though, Microsoft says that new and upcoming processors built upon previous chips \"will be considered as supported, even if not explicitly listed.\"\n\nLastly, Microsoft's processor support axe has been known to sway, and even systems using CPUs outside of the official support lists can and do get Windows updates.",

Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nWith rumors swirling of a potential deal between Intel and TSMC to allow the former's fabs to manufacture the most advanced chips in America, a report from the Taiwanese press claims that TSMC might acquire a 20% stake in Intel's Intel Foundry business. Anti-trust laws typically prevent major companies in a market from coming together, and a 20% stake would allow TSMC to collaborate with Intel while avoiding regulatory scrutiny. Intel's shares have been on a tear and have gained 22.5% over the past five days and 16.7% year to date in a cycle kicked off by Vice President JD Vance's comments in Paris that stressed manufacturing the most advanced semiconductors in the US.\n\nTSMC Might Acquire 20% Stake In Intel's Intel Foundry Services (IFS) Business, Says Report\n\nWhile reports of TSMC being purportedly offered to run Intel's foundries are rapidly spreading, the Taiwanese should find it difficult to run Intel's manufacturing facilities since chip companies use vastly different operational processes to make chips. Additionally, any deal involving Intel and TSMC would undergo strict regulatory scrutiny and might not receive clearance due to monopolistic concerns.\n\nA fresh report, this time from Taiwan's Economic Daily, hints that TSMC might acquire a minority stake in Intel. Additionally, US chip designers Qualcomm and Broadcom might play an important role in the deal as well. The report outlines that the pair can help with the deal by placing orders with the new entity and ensuring that it can smoothly transition to an operational status.\n\nThe Economic Daily's report claims that the Trump administration, under its Made in America plans, hopes that TSMC acquires a 20% stake in Intel's Intel Foundry Services (IFS) business. The report adds that TSMC's investment in IFS might either be through a cash injection or through providing technology, with the final terms being undecided as of now.\n\nFor Broadcom and Qualcomm, an investment in IFS will enable them to better compete with Taiwan's MediaTek. While Chinese technology giant Huawei cannot procure chips manufactured with the most advanced processes, MediaTek faces no such restrictions, and its operations in Asia allow it to compete with the US firms on a cost basis.\n\nReports of an Intel spinoff have been swirling ever since former CEO Patrick Gelsinger's surprise resignation last year. Operating chip manufacturing facilities is a costly endeavor, and one which Intel has struggled to fund due to a sluggish personal computing market and growing demand of GPUs in the enterprise computing sector.\n\nFinancial troubles forced the firm to conduct large scale layoffs and suspend its dividend. While Intel's stock has gained 16.7% year-to-date, the shares are nevertheless down by 46% over the past year as it races to introduce new products and achieve stable production and yields with the 18A manufacturing process technology node.\n\n18A is central to potential spinoff or acquisition as it will determine the orders that the new business can receive for its chips. Intel became the first firm in the world to acquire Dutch firm ASML's advanced high NA EUV chip manufacturing machines. Yet, it posted another net loss in its fourth quarter and guided revenue below consensus analyst estimates.",

            "content": "More than two months ago, Intel (INTC 0.82%) made a surprising move. It pushed CEO Pat Gelsinger out the door. The board of directors did so without lining up a replacement and named two interim co-CEOs in his place, CFO David Zinsner and CEO of Intel Products Michelle Johnston (MJ) Holthaus.\n\nIn some ways, the move made sense. The stock had floundered under Gelsinger as Intel struggled to overcome past missteps, gain ground in AI, and turn its foundry business profitable. However, in other ways, the timing was odd. Gelsinger was in the middle of a massive restructuring of Intel's foundry business, opening it up to outside customers and giving investors a forecast that called for it to generate massive profits by the end of the decade.\n\nAccording to reports, the chip titan is struggling to find a permanent CEO to replace Gelsinger, and that shouldn't come as a surprise. In a number of ways, the next candidate looks set up for failure. Now, Intel's leadership hole is getting even deeper as its chief of the data center and AI segment is jumping ship for Nokia.\n\nHello Nokia, goodbye Intel\n\nNokia said on Monday that Justin Hotard, the leader of Intel's data center and AI segment, will replace outgoing CEO Pekka Lundmark on April 1.\n\nThe move comes a little more than a year after Intel recruited Hotard from Hewlett Packard Enterprise to run the key growth division. Intel has not released a statement on Hotard's departure, though he said in Nokia's press release: \"I am honored by the opportunity to lead Nokia, a global leader in connectivity with a unique heritage in technology.\"\n\nIs Hotard's departure significant?\n\nIntel has already named an interim replacement for Hotard, tapping Karin Eibschitz Segal to head the data center and AI unit. Segal has previously run Intel's operations in Israel.\n\nExecutives change jobs for all types of reasons, and Hotard may have simply jumped at the opportunity to be CEO of a well-known tech company, but the departure throws the company's growth strategy into further disarray.\n\nIt's also possible that Hotard could have been frustrated with the broader turnaround at Intel. The company announced massive layoffs in August. That month, Lip-Bu Tan, a veteran of the semiconductor industry, left the board after expressing frustration with the company's bloated workforce and risk-averse culture.\n\nFollowing Gelsinger's exit, Hotard could have also felt that the company was headed in the wrong direction.\n\nIntel's latest quarter showed that even its data center and AI segment -- its biggest segment after client computing -- continues to struggle, even as peers like Nvidia, AMD, and Micron have posted scorching growth in the data center in their recent quarters. Intel, meanwhile, saw data center and AI revenue decline 3% to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter as overall revenue was down 7% to $14.3 billion.\n\nNotably, investors didn't seem bothered by the news, as Intel stock rose on Monday. But that was likely due to news that its subsidiary Mobileye was teaming up with Lyft to launch robotaxis in 2026.\n\nAbout that CEO opening\n\nOn its recent earnings call, Intel said that the board continues to be \"intensely focused\" on finding a permanent CEO and that the search was progressing.\n\nHowever, media reports have indicated that the company isn't close to naming a new CEO. It's a big decision for the struggling chipmaker, and it put itself in a hole by ousting Gelsinger first rather than working on finding a replacement for him behind the scenes. With Hotard's departure, it seems like Intel is taking another step backward at a time when the company desperately needs to fill its leadership ranks with capable talent.\n\nThat the company's revenue is declining by 7% at a time when the entire industry is seeing tailwinds from the AI boom shows how desperate things have become for Intel.\n\nThe longer the company goes without a permanent CEO, the less likely it is to succeed in its turnaround. Losing its AI chief only adds insult to injury.",

If confirmed, along with reports of a possible sale of Intel's manufacturing division to Taiwan's TSMC, these moves could mark the end of Intel as a fully integrated semiconductor company.\n\nOver the weekend, reports emerged that Taiwanese chip manufacturer TSMC is in talks to acquire Intel's manufacturing division, with the knowledge and support of senior officials in the Trump administration. Now, The Wall Street Journal reports that Broadcom is also interested in acquiring part of Intel. According to the report, the American chip developer is exploring the possibility of purchasing Intel\u2019s chip design and marketing businesses and has held informal discussions with its advisors about submitting an offer. However, Broadcom is not expected to proceed unless it finds a partner willing to acquire Intel's chip manufacturing operations.\n\n1 View gallery Intel offices. ( Photo: Reuters )\n\nAt this stage, no formal offer has been made to Intel. Broadcom and TSMC are not working together, and discussions on both potential deals remain preliminary and largely unofficial. However, if these moves materialize, they could lead to the breakup of Intel\u2014one of the world\u2019s most influential technology companies, which for decades shaped not only the semiconductor industry but also the development of personal computing.\n\nAnother possible scenario is that Intel sells only one of its divisions\u2014either manufacturing or design\u2014while continuing to operate in a more focused capacity. In that case, Intel would resemble modern semiconductor companies such as Nvidia and TSMC, which specialize in either chip development or manufacturing rather than maintaining both capabilities. This would mark a major shift from Intel\u2019s traditional model as a vertically integrated chip giant, a position it has held since its founding.\n\nIntel's interim executive chairman, Frank Yeary, has been leading the discussions with possible suitors and Trump administration officials, who are concerned about the fate of a company seen as critical to national security, the report said.\n\nYeary has been telling individuals close to him that he is most focused on maximizing value for Intel shareholders, the report added.\n\nFormer Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted last year, set sky-high expectations for Intel's manufacturing and AI capabilities among major clients but fell short, leading to the chipmaker losing or canceling contracts.\n\nIntel's shares lost about 60% of their value last year as its capital-intensive bid to bolster manufacturing - a strategy championed by Gelsinger - strained the company's cash flow and ultimately led to it cutting about 15% of its workforce.",

It particularly partners with many U.S. brands, using its ever-advancing manufacturing processes to build the semiconductors that power many of the electronics that we use today. However, the Trump Administration is adamant about pushing forward a \u201cMade In USA\u201d ethos when it comes to developing products moving forward.\n\nTech informant, @Jukanlosreve detailed; referencing the Taiwanese publication DigiTimes, that the U.S. government has given TSMC three alternatives to retain business within the country. Ultimately, the plan would meld TSMC from an international corporation to one with the U.S. as its domestic home base, in addition to assisting the U.S.-founded Intel Foundry in gaining traction in the industry.\n\nThe first option proposes that TSMC establish a packaging facility stateside. This would be a major step toward the U.S.\u2019 aim of not having to rely on international resources. However, TSMC has already been slow to consider this option due to \u201clabor shortages and low-profit margins,\u201d Jukanlosreve noted.\n\nThe second option proposes a joint venture between TSMC and Intel Foundry, in which TSMC and other companies would invest in Intel financially, and there could be a potential technology transfer of TSMC\u2019s company and intellectual property. The Taiwanese manufacturer is strongly against this option as it could take TSMC out of the semiconductor market, potentially to put Intel Foundry in its place. Wccftech noted that TSMC and Intel use different manufacturing technologies, suggesting a refreshed Intel would need to develop a new manufacturing process.\n\nThe third option proposes that Intel Foundry move forward as the main supplier for all U.S. partners. Once again, this option puts TSMC at risk of losing, not only its customers but its mainstay in the industry.\n\nThis news among various reports sent Intel stock up in recent days, with shares trading at 29.2% on Thursday and seeing a four-day positive streak, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nThe spike came after Vice President J.D. Vance spoke at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris earlier this week, about bringing semiconductor manufacturing to the U.S. being an important goal of the new administration. He noted that Intel stood to benefit from any plans the government has given it is the country\u2019s largest chip manufacturer, according to Market Watch.",

Wei had ruled out taking over Intel's facilities during the firm's earnings call for Q3 2024. Wei was asked again in January whether his firm would be interested in taking over Intel's facilities, and his response was more muted as the executive simply shared that TSMC values all of its customers and refused to comment further on the matter.\n\nTSMC CEO Had Ruled Out Buying Intel's Foundries In 2024 & Refused Comment This January\n\nIntel's shares, to the surprise of many, have gained 16% year-to-date despite no meaningful turnaround in the firm's operations. The stock is up by 22% over the past five days as it marks its gains following Vice President JD Vance's comments about making the most advanced AI chips in America and rumors of the Trump administration pressing TSMC to either enter into a joint venture with Intel or outright buy and operate the firm's chip factories.\n\nHowever, while news of a tie up between Intel and TSMC has only publicly started to make rounds in 2025, TSMC's CEO Dr. C.C. Wei had been asked about the affair as early as the firm's third quarter earnings call in October last year.\n\nBack then, Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan asked Wei whether his firm had considered acquiring a part of Intel's fabs in the long term. Wei's response was direct and clear as he simply replied, \"The answer is no. Okay, no, not at all.\" The executive then proceeded to share that Intel was a very \"good customer\" for TSMC and was sending \"sizable business\" to the firm.\n\nAfter the third quarter earnings call in October, Wei was again asked about whether anything had changed regarding his firm's outlook for taking over Intel's fabs. This time around, Wei's response was calibrated.\n\nResponding to JPMorgan's Gokul Hariharan, the CEO replied that, \"They are very good customers. I like them, and they are very important to TSMC's business also.\" However, he didn't directly address the question of taking over the fabs and concluded by remarking, \"That's all I can say.\"\n\nTSMC's business in the US and its exports to America have come under fresh scrutiny under the Trump administration. The President has proposed levying a whopping 100% tariffs on Taiwan's chips, as he believes that the island region has stolen America's chip manufacturing lead.\n\nIn response, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te outlined recently that his government will discuss the tariffs with the industry and then offer solutions to the US President. Lai stressed that it is important to build a \"democratic supply chain\" for semiconductors, adding that it was his country's goal to contribute to the international community.\n\nTSMC is Taiwan's largest firm in terms of market value and revenue. Any tariffs on its products will deal a hefty blow to the island's economy and its national security. The fab is often referred to as a 'sacred mountain' in Taiwan as its criticality in the global chip supply chain bolsters Taiwan's international stature.",

Vance said the Trump administration would \"ensure\" that AI in the US is built \"with American designed and manufactured chips.\" Shares of Intel jumped 6% following the comments.\n\nStruggling chipmaker Intel, once the world's leading semiconductor firm, is the only American company that would be capable of manufacturing AI chips at scale, if its latest manufacturing developments are successful. Rivals Samsung (005930.KS) and TSMC have expanded operations in the US with support from the US CHIPS Act, but most of their manufacturing capabilities are in their home countries.\n\nLeading American tech firms such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) rely on Taiwan's TSMC (TSM), not Intel, to make their most advanced chips, and Taiwan accounts for the second-largest share of total semiconductor imports in the US. The risk of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, given rising US-China tensions, has prompted the US government to focus on expanding its domestic chip manufacturing footprint.\n\nIntel's stock was also helped this week by reports that the Trump administration is making moves that could aid Intel's turnaround effort by enlisting the help of its rival TSMC.\n\nA Baird analyst on Wednesday wrote in a note to investors that there are rumors of the US funding a joint venture between TSMC and Intel, in which TSMC would \"send engineers\" to Intel, \"applying the company's know-how to insure that fab and subsequent manufacturing projects from Intel become viable.\"\n\nTech news site DigiTimes Asia, citing unnamed sources, said Thursday that the joint venture was one of three proposals the US government had floated to TSMC during confidential discussions. Another proposal would involve TSMC allowing Intel to handle its packaging orders from US-based customers, the outlet said, citing industry sources.\n\nWall Street analysts were skeptical about such a venture.\n\n\"[W]e don\u2019t know why TSMC would want to license their process tech and IP (voluntarily at least) to a potential leading edge competitor, unless the terms are very favorable,\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote.

After forcing CEO Pat Gelsinger out in December, there have been questions about whether Intel would sell the foundry business outright and just seek to be a chip designer.\n\nHowever, that asset base also makes Intel attractive at a time when U.S. policy is to move chip production back to the U.S.\n\nThat logic ties into the two primary factors lifting Intel stock this week. First, rumors started circulating that TSMC, the world's biggest chip foundry, could form some kind of joint venture with Intel to help it manufacture advanced chips in the U.S. These rumors don't seem to have come from either company, and instead evolved in the media based on the federal government's desire to make the U.S. a hub of chip manufacturing.\n\nRelatedly, the stock also got a jolt after Vice President JD Vance said that the Trump administration would \"ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the U.S. with American designed and manufactured chips.\"\n\nInvestors interpreted that as a good sign for Intel.\n\nIs Intel's foundry biz an asset or an albatross?\n\nIntel is losing billions of dollars a year, but the company is the biggest U.S. chip manufacturer, giving it a possible advantage at a time when the federal government wants to bring chip production home.\n\nMaking that policy a reality has so far proven harder than expected, and some lawmakers have cast doubt on whether it's wise for the U.S. to pour billions into the struggling company through the CHIPS Act.\n\nAt this point, this week's gains seem to be mostly based on conjecture, but it does show the potential for the foundry business to drive a recovery in the stock.

TSMC is at least entertaining the suggestion, Bloomberg reported, citing a single anonymous source.\n\nSubsequently, Reuters cited an anonymous Trump administration official saying the president would be \u201cunlikely\u201d to support a foreign company operating Intel\u2019s factories.\n\nBoth reports could be true. The Trump administration has sometimes explored mutually exclusive ideas in the weeks since President Donald Trump returned to office.\n\nIntel\u2019s stock climbed about 20% following reports about Intel and TSMC earlier in the week, along with comments from Vice President JD Vance that the Trump administration wants to ensure that companies continue making advanced computer chips in the U.S.\n\nNeither Intel nor TSMC commented on the reports and Intel\u2019s stock sank about 3% Friday, reflecting market skepticism about a potential transaction.\n\nInvestment analysts noted this week that any deal that gave TSMC a major stake in Intel would be very complex and might not benefit either company.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know why TSMC would want to license their process tech and (intellectual property)\u2026to a leading edge competitor, unless the terms are very favorable,\u201d Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to clients Friday, ahead of the Bloomberg report.\n\nThe U.S. has financial and political leverage that could, possibly, compel a deal.\n\nIntel finalized a deal for $7.9 billion in federal subsidies last November following months of negotiations with the Biden administration. The company hasn\u2019t received most of that funding yet, and the Trump administration could seek to stall or block further payments if Intel resisted its plan.\n\nAlternately, the administration could offer more financial assistance to complete a deal. And it could use the threat of tariffs on computer chips made in Taiwan to encourage TSMC to play along.\n\nIntel is already separating its manufacturing arm from the part of the business that designs new computer chips \u2013 possibly into two standalone companies. The chipmaker is trying to recover from a severe technology deficit that left it trailing TSMC and other competitors.\n\nIf TSMC were to take over Intel\u2019s factory business, that could have serious implications in Oregon. Intel is the state\u2019s largest corporate employer and it engineers each new generation of manufacturing process technology at a research factory in Hillsboro.\n\nShould TSMC take over Intel\u2019s factories, it might prefer to continue doing its most advanced work in Taiwan rather than conduct a parallel process in Oregon.\n\nThat might undermine the Trump administration\u2019s goal of bolstering the domestic chip industry by leaving the U.S. without any advanced process development work.\n\n-- Mike Rogoway covers Oregon technology and the state economy.

            "content": "The rumor that the U.S. government is allegedly pushing a joint venture between Intel and TSMC has sparked an outcry in Taiwan about the chance of the country losing its 'Silicon Shield,' a theory that TSMC's crucial role in global chip manufacturing would prevent China from invading, or spur other countries to rush to its aid in the event of war. Naturally, the rumored partnership would impact TSMC\u2019s strategy and Taiwan's politics. With such a JV, Taiwan would no longer be the world\u2019s key supplier of advanced processors.\n\n\"'Media reports' gone wild,\" wrote Dan Nystedt, vice president at TriOrient, an Asia-based private investment company, in an X post. \"Headlines from Taiwan [are] from pro-Chinese Communist Party/anti-America media.\"\n\nIndeed, Taiwanese media treat TSMC and the country as one, warning that TSMC will become partly an American company and Taiwan will lose its \u2018Silicon Shield.\u2019 Nystedt pointed out three headlines:\n\nNo.1 foreign analyst warns: be afraid for TSMC! The whole bowl is going to be taken away. [Link]\n\nShocking report: The U.S. asks TSMC to save Intel with a joint venture fab, technology transfer: Taiwan is finished! [Link]\n\nRivals become teammates? TSMC and Intel are joining forces to become US Semiconductor (USSMC). [Link]\n\nMost stories rebuff the original report and add commentary that the joint venture will not benefit TSMC but instead harm the company and the country. Some even try to drag in unrelated facts as indirect confirmations supporting the joint venture. Earlier this month, TSMC\u2019s board of directors held its first-ever Q1 meeting in the U.S. instead of Taiwan. While business media attributed this to the company\u2019s preparations to formally kick off mass production of advanced processors at Fab 21 in Arizona\u2014a first in TSMC\u2019s history\u2014Taiwanese media claimed that the meeting was tied to Trump\u2019s possible return to the Oval Office.\n\nHowever, while the media tends to stoke fears in headlines, it also quotes analysts who believe that, given the onshoring trend, TSMC's decision to build production capacity outside Taiwan was inevitable. Nonetheless, even these analysts believe that TSMC may experience unprecedented political pressure in the U.S.\n\nYang Yingchao, chairman of Kirkland Capital, told China Times News Network that TSMC\u2019s Fab 21 project in Arizona has significant political implications, as setting up a chip production site worth $65 billion in the U.S. is commercially impractical for TSMC. Producing chips in Taiwan is far more cost-effective due to lower expenses and a larger workforce of engineers. Additionally, since chips are small and easy to transport, there is little logistical benefit in manufacturing them in the U.S. However, it has become nearly impossible for TSMC to avoid expanding its production capacity in America now that advanced chip supplies have become a matter of national security and economic prosperity.\n\nYang Yingchao also doubts the likelihood of the U.S. government imposing a 100% tariff on Taiwan-made chips. He argues that Trump often uses bold threats as leverage in negotiations, citing previous instances where similar tariff threats were eventually dropped. Imposing a 100% tariff on chips would likely increase consumer prices or within the supply chain, ultimately harming the U.S. economy.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Having led technologically for some decades, Intel fell behind demands for advanced chips after the iPhone emergence and most recently on the burgeoning demand for chips needed for artificial intelligence training.\n\nThe Biden administration, and now the incoming Trump administration, seem determined to support and subsidize the US semiconductor industry for competitiveness and security imperatives. A central vehicle for this semiconductor industrial policy initiative is the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. In addition to providing substantial sums for R&D, the act provided some $39 billion to advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the US.\n\nDespite this support, Intel\u2019s struggles have continued, and indeed become graver. In 2022, in an attempt to regain technological prowess, the company brought back former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who had led the company before its downward spiral. Gelsinger embarked on a highly ambitious campaign not only to restore Intel\u2019s lead in advanced chip design, but also to compete in the capital-intensive market for manufacturing chips. Over the past three years, while there has been some progress on the design side, Intel has failed to significantly beak into chip manufacturing\u2014even as huge capital costs sapped the company\u2019s resources and undercut investor confidence. Last December, only weeks after the Biden administration signed an agreement to supply some $7.5 billion in manufacturing subsidies for Intel for new \u201cfab\u201d construction, the Intel board fired Gelsinger, leaving the company with interim leadership.\n\nThat brings us to the Trump administration. Despite his jabs at the CHIPS Act, President Trump has stated his commitment to reshoring US manufacturing, particularly in strategic technologies like semiconductors (export controls will not hold China back forever).\n\nThus, the administration should pursue the following strategies:\n\nFirst, encourage Intel leadership to hive off the chip-manufacturing segment of the company, as either a separate independent element or a totally independent one. Such a move would allow Intel to concentrate solely on advanced chip design. A recent Wall Street Journal thorough analysis showed that Intel faces strong competition from its US and foreign competitors as a result of its own failings and profound changes in the semiconductor design market. It will have a much better chance of regaining at least some of its technological superiority absent the resource-gobbling fab competition. Down the road, the administration would have to decide if further subsidies to Intel are warranted or whether this would be a fruitless and wasteful effort.\n\nSecond, should Intel continue to struggle in fab competition, despite the president\u2019s resistance to foreign subsidies, the Trump administration should move with dispatch to sign contracts with TSMC and other manufacturers to fill the gap in future years.\n\nFoolishly and dangerously, President Trump has vowed to put tariffs on semiconductors. TSMC manufactures 90 percent of the world\u2019s most advanced chips and while it is investing in the United States, it will be many years before the US can cease importing these chips from the company.",

The ascendance of rival Nvidia amid the AI boom has left Intel in the dust.

            "content": "A Wall Street analyst's speculation suggests that the U.S. government is pushing Intel and TSMC to form a joint chip production venture, which would be owned by the two companies and operated by TSMC.\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal report, the U.S. government wants TSMC to apply its experience with high-volume manufacturing using EUV lithography to Intel's process technologies. Another rumor cited by the Financial Times points to TSMC's accelerated Arizona Fab 21 complex expansion.\n\nA weird rumor\n\n\"There are discussions from the Asia supply chain that the U.S. government will get involved in potentially the following: TSMC would send engineers to Intel's 3nm/2nm fab, applying the company's know-how to ensure that the fab and subsequent manufacturing projects from Intel become viable,\" Tristan Gerra, an analyst with Baird, wrote in a note sent to clients (via @WallStEngine). \"The fab could be spun off into a new entity jointly owned by TSMC and Intel, and run by TSMC. The new entity would receive U.S. Chip Act funding.\"\n\nAlthough Tristan Gerra admits there are no confirmations of the rumors and that the project could take a long time to materialize, the strategy apparently appears logical to analysts. If implemented, Intel's financial pressures would be eased, and it could shift its focus toward chip architecture and platform solutions. Also, Intel would retain its manufacturing capacity, aligning with the strategy set by former chief executive Pat Gelsinger. Additionally, an operational and competitive fabrication facility could draw major chip designers seeking a stable and geographically secure manufacturing alternative, which would ensure the utilization of the fab.\n\nThe rumor is odd, raising both business and technology concerns. Let\u2019s start with the technology \u2014 two ways for semiconductor producers to \u201cshare know-how\u201d would be by helping each other tune equipment for a particular process technology (or technologies, as Intel 3-capable fabs are likely also capable of 18A), or porting an established production node to a new fab.\n\nTechnology concerns\n\nTSMC engineers are unfamiliar with Intel\u2019s EUV-based fabrication processes and process recipes, so their ability to tune anything will be limited, or take months. Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s 3nm node is in mass production, and the 18A manufacturing technology will enter high-volume manufacturing a few months later. Based on what Intel says about 18A, this process does not need further tuning, especially not adjustments made by external engineers.\n\nPorting TSMC\u2019s fabrication technologies to an Intel fab in the U.S. is challenging. Even though Intel and TSMC fabs might use EUV lithography, each has unique tool setups, fab configurations, and vendor-specific modifications. For example, ASML\u2019s lithography machines typically feature custom calibrations and/or additional modules that suit the chipmakers' respective processes. Also, Intel and TSMC have different etch recipes, deposition sequences, and step-by-step controls, which usually affect tools.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFabrication processes depend on carefully vetted materials with strict purity and composition requirements. Even small changes in photoresist or etch chemistries can introduce defects or cause process drift. Moreover, TSMC\u2019s approved chemical suppliers and their formulations differ from Intel\u2019s, and it is not guaranteed that the raw materials used by TSMC can effectively be used on Intel\u2019s tools.\n\nEven minor variations in temperature controls, gas flows, or photomask handling can cause significant drift in line widths, transistor characteristics, and yields, making porting complex, expensive, or financially unfeasible.\n\nBusiness concerns\n\nOn the business side of the issue, TSMC has no interest in helping Intel improve its EUV fabrication technologies as Intel is a rival. The company also does not need to form a joint venture with Intel, as it could impact its gross margins. The only motivation for TSMC to work with Intel would be to avoid potential tariffs introduced by the Trump administration, which could require TSMC to produce advanced chips on its N3 (3nm-class) and N2 (2nm-class) process technologies in the U.S.\n\nHowever, Intel is unlikely to have enough EUV production capacity in America to meet demand for its products and products from TSMC\u2019s customers. To that end, accelerating the adoption of N3 and N2 in TSMC's own Arizona fabs, as reported by the Financial Times citing industry analysts, makes far more business sense.\n\nFor Intel, working with TSMC also seems impractical. It is unlikely that TSMC engineers can help significantly improve Intel 3nm and 18A process technologies. However, porting TSMC nodes to fabs in the U.S. means that Intel\u2019s fabs in Ireland and Israel would be the only facility to use Intel\u2019s nodes.\n\nYet, it is unlikely that these sites will be financially viable in the long run, as process technologies cost billions to develop, and the more chips a company produces using a single node, the better. For obvious reasons, TSMC is hardly interested in porting its advanced nodes to Intel facilities in Ireland and Israel, even as part of a joint venture, as this could create overcapacity for its fabrication technologies.\n\nThoughts\n\nOngoing geopolitical turmoil, coupled with Intel's financial and execution struggles, have generated various rumors surrounding the blue giant. In this case, significant technological and business hurdles \u2014 ranging from differences in tooling process recipes at Intel and TSMC to TSMC's lack of incentive to aid a competitor \u2014 cast doubt on the feasibility of such a partnership.",

Though Intel has a heaping pile of internal issues that have set back its dominance in chip manufacturing, the company is one of the United States' biggest hopes for domestic AI chip production. Intel is the only large-scale American leading-edge foundry for computer chips \u2014 which means it manufactures chips for both itself and other companies.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the world's most advanced chips for AI are manufactured in Taiwan by TSMC (TSM). Even Intel outsources production of its most advanced AI chips to its rival. While Korea's Samsung (005930.KS) and TSMC have expanded operations in the US thanks to financial incentives from the US CHIPS Act, most of their manufacturing capacity is in their home countries.\n\nIt's unclear how Trump would \"ensure\" AI systems in the United States use US-made chips, as Vance said. Trump on his campaign trail bashed the CHIPS Act, a set of financial incentives for chip companies aimed at bolstering domestic production, which was passed under former President Joe Biden but authored under Trump's first administration. Trump suggested on an appearance on the \"Joe Rogan Experience\" in October that he would put tariffs on chip imports, believing that would force companies to relocate to the US.\n\n\"[Y]ou put a big tariff on the chips coming in. I say, 'You don't have to pay the tariff, all you have to do is build your plant in the United States,'\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel has fallen far behind TSMC in manufacturing, and current employees at Intel's foundry told Yahoo Finance in December that its latest manufacturing process for AI chips has \"a lot of issues.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance addresses the audience at the Grand Palais during the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris on Tuesday, Feb. 11, 2025. (AP Photo/Michel Euler) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nIntel's long-term commitment to foundry has also recently been called into question. The company began its massive push toward opening up its manufacturing business to external customers under CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted by the board in December as investors grew impatient with the money-losing approach.

Details are scanty at this point, but investors seem to like the idea of the two forging closer ties, and as of 11:15 a.m. ET, Intel stock was up 3%.\n\nWhat we know about Intel and TSMC\n\nAt this point, the rumors are just that, and probably shouldn't be relied upon too much. Which is to say: Don't go getting irrationally exuberant over this. But with that caveat made, here's what Baird says is happening:\n\nThe U.S. government is trying to convince Intel to spin off its semiconductor fabrication business, which would then become a joint venture between Intel and TSMC. Then, TSMC would lend some of its semiconductor engineers and expertise to the new joint venture, helping it make the process leap to manufacturing advanced 3-nanometer and even 2-nanometer chips in the U.S. This JV would be able to manufacture Intel chips, TSMC chips, and chips from other fabless semiconductor companies on contract.\n\nSweetening the deal further, federal money from the CHIPS Act could be used to subsidize the new venture's operations, reports TheFly.com.\n\nIs Intel stock a sell?\n\nAll of this sounds promising, yet Gerra isn't quite ready to call Intel stock a buy based on it. He's maintaining a neutral rating on it until the rumors are confirmed. I think that's smart.\n\nIntel is unprofitable at present, with net losses totaling $18.8 billion over the last 12 months, and it isn't expected to return to GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) profitability until 2026 at the earliest.

The first two are single socket servers. HPE told us they are seeing a slow migration towards single CPU server designs as processors get more cores. The first is the 1U HPE ProLiant DL320 Gen12. Note we are purposefully dropping \u201cCompute\u201d from the names because that is superfluous naming.\n\nHPE is offering a lot of air or liquid cooled servers in this generation to help with heat.\n\nThe next is the HPE ProLiant DL340 Gen12. This is a 2U design that should allow for more expansion and lower power since it can house larger fans. Sadly, HPE is still using the old practice of having standard and high-performance heatsinks and fans. The more modern trend is to just use high-performance components, so hopefully by the next-generation HPE will modernize this design aspect.\n\nFor more traditional dual socket servers, there is the HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen12 in the 1U form factor. You will notice here the 144 core designs. That is for the Intel Xeon 6700E series.\n\nThe HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen12 is the 2U dual socket Xeon 6 server. Using EDSFF this can fit up to 36 SSDs.\n\nThe HPE ProLiant DL380a Gen12 is the GPU compute for the PCIe card accelerators like the NVLink PCIe cards and the NVIDIA L40S.\n\nFor tower form factors, we have the HPE ProLiant ML350 Gen12. We last looked at this design in the HPE ProLiant ML350 Gen10 generation, but these are propular outside of the data center.\n\nYou may have noticed that these have iLO 7. HPE continues to drive its remote management solution and upgrade that against the backdrop of the industry generally moving to ASPEED chips. Still, HPE has a lot of management tools available that let you do things like see on a map where servers are experiencing an issue, so that is one reason that HPE continues to go the proprietary route here.\n\nFinal Words\n\nPerhaps these are technically being released with 144 core CPU support, but the real big one is going to be Granite Rapids-SP. Intel\u2019s 8-channel DDR5 chip has many of the features of its larger Granite Rapids-AP (Xeon 6900P series) but with smaller packaging for those who do not want to move to the 12-channel platforms. Intel said that the Xeon 6700P series was launcing in Q1 2025 so that gives only a few more weeks for the launch. Of course, stay tuned to STH for launch coverage.",

This comes on the heels of the embattled chipmaker losing its CEO in December.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nIntel has struggled to keep up with rivals in the uber-lucrative data center and AI space and its stock reflects this poor performance, down roughly 50% over the last year. Even though this news brings some uncertainty, the departure of the person in charge of this crucial yet failing division was welcomed by investors looking for a turnaround.\n\nMore news\n\nIntel stock was also aided by comments made by Vice President JD Vance in today's keynote speech at the Paris AI summit. The vice president promised that the U.S. would safeguard American AI technologies and urged regulators in Europe to reduce regulations targeting AI.\n\nIntel is an American company with manufacturing capability in the U.S. Rival chipmakers like Nvidia fabricate their chips primarily in Taiwan.

The new federal stance marks a clear shift away from Biden-era regulations focused on safeguarding consumers and workers from the potential risks of artificial intelligence and automated decision-making. President Trump signed Executive Order 14179, which calls for an action plan to foster AI innovation by reducing regulatory barriers and promoting U.S. leadership in AI technology.\n\nIntel Shares Jump 10% on Trump Administration's New AI Policy\n\nThe administration stressed the country's demand for minimal constraints in developing AI systems and chips and pledged to promote domestic manufacturing and innovation. A tech investor and former executive has also been appointed as the AI & Crypto Czar at the White House to lead policy developments. This may encourage state legislators to draft their own policies to fill any cracks left by the federal policy change.

The Core Ultra 9 285H is a 16 core chip comprised of 6 Performance Cores, 8 Efficiency Cores and two low power E-Cores situated on a separate low power island, specifically dedicated for specialized low lift workloads like video playback, etc. This configuration brings us to 16 CPU cores and threads total, with a beefed-up Intel Xe Alchemist GPU architecture, now with 2x the L2 cache with 8MB dedicated for the GPU, and 2 Render Slices, each with 4 Xe-cores, totaling up to 8 Xe-cores with 128 total vector engines on board.This version of Arc 140 graphics, or what Intel call's \"LPG+\", incorporates twice as many Vector Engines as Lunar Lake's Battlemage infused GPU, but is similar to Meteor Lake, except for its increased L2 cache and the addition of XMX (Xe Matrix Extensions) for AI workloads and Intel's latest XeSS2 Super Resolution upscaling with Frame Generation. All in, Intel is claiming Arrow Lake-H's GPU offers a 22% geomean lift in gaming performance versus Meteor Lake without XeSS2 enabled and even higher performance with Frame Gen turned on.And with all that setup and background covered, what do you say we look at Core Ultra 9 285H Arrow Lake-H performance with MSI's Prestige 16 AI Evo laptop, next...\n\nWhen Intel took the wraps off its next generation Arrow Lake-H mobile CPUs back at CES earlier this year, we were encouraged by the potential of the updated chip core architecture, as well as the platform's interesting integrated Arc graphics GPU updates and IO technology support for Thunderbolt 5 and PCIe Gen 5. Intel has seemingly revamped its higher performance laptop platform processor family with a bit of augmented previous generation technology, along with new core technologies, but optimized and scaled up for more performance at a higher power envelope.The only thing left to do was explore Arrow Lake-H's performance for ourselves and prove out Intel's claims in real world testing, and that's what we're able to show you here today via the MSI Prestige 16 AI Evo, a premium 16-inch thin and light laptop that strikes a minimalist pose.How does Intel's new 28 to 45 Watt premium performance thin and light laptop platform compete versus the likes of AMD's Ryzen AI 300 series or Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite, and can Intel keep pace with rising competition from all sides? Let's answer these questions on the pages ahead...We've seen MSI's Prestige 16 AI Evo laptop in previous Intel Core Ultra mobile launches, specifically for the launch of Intel's previous gen Meteor Lake platform . Interestingly, the machine we've tested for this evaluation today is identical to the machine we tested a little over year ago for the Meteor Lake launch. As such, this review is not about the test vehicle laptop we received, which is an engineering sample by the way, but the Arrow Lake-H Core Ultra 9 285H processor under its hood.",

Intel\u2019s board made the appointments after it reportedly forced the company\u2019s former CEO, Pat Gelsinger, to retire in early December amid mounting financial struggles and questions about his comeback plan.\n\nAt the time, Holthaus was also given the newly created title of CEO of Intel Products, which gives her control over the company\u2019s three core chip design businesses: the Data Center and AI Group, the Client Computing Group and the Network and Edge Group.\n\nA little more than a week after taking the new roles, Holthaus made her first public comments about the chipmaker\u2019s strategy as interim co-CEO and Intel Products CEO, indicating that she was more confident about the company\u2019s current path in the PC market than its efforts with AI accelerator chips or server CPUs.\n\n\u201cOn the data center side, we have a lot of work to do there. But on the client side, our say-do ratio for the last four years has been very good,\u201d she said at an investor event on Dec. 12.\n\nFor DCAI, Holthaus said, she will be \u201claser-focused\u201d on winning back customers who turned to AMD for server CPUs and added that she would be open to road map changes.\n\nHolthaus also offered a blunt assessment of Intel\u2019s AI accelerator chip strategy, which also falls under DCAI, saying that its accelerator chip brand, Gaudi, \u201cdoes not allow me to get to the masses.\u201d This came after Gelsinger disclosed in Intel\u2019s November earnings call that the company would not meet the modest, $500 revenue target it set for Gaudi chip sales in 2024.\n\nLooking to Intel\u2019s next-generation AI chip, code-named Falcon Shores, Holthaus tempered expectations by saying that it would not be \u201cwonderful\u201d but rather a \u201cgood first step.\u201d\n\nMore than a month later during Intel\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call in late January, Holthaus disclosed that the company no longer plans to sell Falcon Shores, which was due at the end of 2025, so that it can focus on developing a \u201csystem-level solution at rack scale\u201d with a successor chip it\u2019s calling Jaguar Shores.\n\nShe also disclosed that Intel\u2019s next-gen Xeon CPU with efficient cores, Clearwater Forest, had been delayed to the first half of 2026 from the original 2025 timeframe the chipmaker had given. Despite the setback, Holthaus said, \u201cthis year is all about improving\u201d the competitive position of its Xeon CPU products \u201cas we fight to close the gap to competition.\u201d\n\nBut while Holthaus said Intel\u2019s Xeon 6 CPUs with performance cores, code-named Granite Rapids have \u201cbeen a good first step\u201d after launching last year, she noted that the Xeon 6 CPUs with efficient cores weren\u2019t getting the traction Intel had hoped for.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that\u2019s more of a niche market, and we haven\u2019t seen volume materialize there as fast as we expected,\u201d she said.\n\nHotard Faced Rising Competition On Multiple Fronts\n\nDuring Hotard\u2019s stint as the head of Intel\u2019s Data Center and AI Group, the business faced growing competition on multiple fronts.\n\nIn the server CPU market, AMD continues to put pressure on Intel, growing its market share for x86-based products in the segment to 24.2 percent against Intel in last year\u2019s third quarter. This, along with AMD\u2019s early success in the AI accelerator chip market, allowed the competitor to make nearly as much data center revenue as Intel did last year.\n\nIntel is also facing a threat in the form of Arm, whose instruction set architecture that has dominated smartphone chips is now the basis for custom server CPUs designed by Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud for their own infrastructure. In fact, AWS said in December that more than half of the new CPU capacity it brought online over the last two years was based on its Arm-based Graviton chips.\n\nThe greater threat, however, has been the rapid rise of Nvidia in the data center, where it has commanded a significantly larger chunk of spending than Intel. This is the result of Nvidia\u2019s early investments in accelerated computing combined with an ongoing boom in AI development that has kept demand high for its expensive but powerful GPUs and related products.\n\nAccording to a previous CRN analysis, Nvidia is expected to finish its 2025 fiscal year, which ended in January, with $128.6 billion in revenue, most of which will come from the company\u2019s data center segment. By contrast, Intel ended its most recent fiscal year with less than half: $53.1 billion, less than a quarter of which came from data center sales.\n\nIntel has also had to deal with more successful AI chip efforts from Nvidia competitors ranging from AMD, which finished last year with more than $5 billion in sales from its Instinct data center GPUs, to Broadcom, which grew AI revenue from custom chip engagements and Ethernet products by 220 percent to $12.2 billion last year.\n\nHotard Helped Define Gaudi 3 AI Chip Strategy\n\nWhen Hotard became the head of DCAI a year ago, one of his responsibilities was to help define the strategy for the Gaudi 3 AI accelerator chip, which launched in late 2024.\n\nWhereas the predecessor chip, Gaudi 2, received little to no support from OEMs and cloud service providers, Gaudi 3 was set to go in servers from several major OEMs, including Dell Technologies, HPE and Lenovo. It would also get support from IBM Cloud.\n\nThe issue was that Gaudi 3 was not as powerful as Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPU, which came out in 2022, and Nvidia had since turned its focus to a more capable successor called the H200 that launched last year and the next-gen Blackwell GPUs that debuted in early 2025.\n\nAt an Intel data center event last September, Hotard said his team arrived at a strategy to focus on Gaudi 3\u2019s \u201cprice performance advantage,\u201d largely for inferencing smaller, task-based AI models and open-source models, after talking with customers.\n\n\u201cWe feel like where we are with the product, the customers that are engaged, the problems we're solving, that's our swim lane. The bet is that the market will open up in that space, and there'll be a bunch of people building their own inferencing solutions,\u201d he said.",

He currently leads the data center and AI unit at US chipmaker Intel.\n\nNokia has appointed Intel data center executive Justin Hotard as its CEO to replace Pekka Lundmark, who is stepping down.\n\nLundmark, who will also relinquish the post of Nokia chairman, departs following months of speculation that Nokia were looking to replace him as CEO. When the reports first emerged last year, Nokia denied Lundmark's position was under threat.\n\nThe 61-year-old has led Nokia since 2020, and will continue as an advisor to Hotard until the end of this year. Lundmark first joined Nokia in 1990 as an account manager, before leaving in 2000 and later returning to lead the business after a five-year spell as CEO of Finnish energy firm Fortum.\n\n\u201cLeading Nokia has been a privilege,\" said Lundmark. \"When I returned to Nokia in 2020, I called it a homecoming, and it really has felt like one. I am proud of the work our brilliant team has done in re-establishing our technology leadership and competitiveness, and positioning the company for growth in data centers, private wireless and industrial Edge, and defense. This is the right time for me to move on.\"\n\nHowever, Lundmark came under pressure last year as the vendor failed to improve its share price. Revenue at the vendor is now lower now than it was back in 2016 when it acquired French rival Alcatel-Lucent in an all-share deal worth \u20ac15.6 billion ($16.1bn).\n\nNokia, which has previously bemoaned weaker demand for its 5G equipment in North America and Europe, announced in 2023 it will cut 14,000 jobs, equivalent to 16 percent of its workforce, in an effort to reduce costs.\n\nIt does appear, however, that the vendor is bouncing back, after Nokia reported an increase in net sales of nine percent for the final quarter of 2024, although overall net sales for the full year dipped nine percent to \u20ac19.2bn ($20bn).\n\nLundmark's replacement, Hotard, has previously held leadership roles at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, NCR Corporation, and Symbol Technologies (acquired by Motorola). He will be based at the company\u2019s headquarters in Espoo, Finland.\n\n\"Networks are the backbone that power society and businesses, and enable generational technology shifts like the one we are currently experiencing in AI. I am excited to get started and look forward to continuing Nokia\u2019s transformation journey to maximize its potential for growth and value creation,\u201d said Hotard.\n\nIntel appointed Hotard to lead its data center unit last January.\n\nHotard joined the chipmaker after an eight-and-a-half-year stint at HPE, where he most recently served as executive vice president and general manager of High-Performance Computing, AI, and Labs.\n\nNokia's data center play?\n\nHotard's work around data centers and AI could suggest a change of focus for the vendor, which signed a number of data center partnerships last year.\n\nIn Nokia's announcement today, Sari Baldauf, chair of Nokia\u2019s board of directors noted that AI and data center markets are \"critical areas for Nokia\u2019s future growth.\"\n\nIn October, Lundmark said Nokia sees a \"significant opportunity\" to expand its presence in the data center market.\n\nFollowing his comments, Nokia extended its existing agreement to supply Microsoft Azure with data center routers and switches. Then in December, Nokia along with Kyndryl announced plans to offer advanced data center networking solutions and services to global enterprises.\n\nIn September, Nokia also announced the launch of a data center automation platform, which it describes as an \"event-driven automation\" (EDA) platform.",

Greg Corke pits the AMD Ryzen 9000 Series against the Intel Core Ultra 200S to find out\n\nAfter years of playing second fiddle, AMD is now giving Intel a serious run for its money. In high-end workstations, AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro dominates Intel Xeon in most real-world benchmarks. The immensely powerful multi-core processor now plays a starring role in the portfolios of all the major workstation OEMs.\n\nBut what about the mainstream workstation market? Here, Intel has managed to maintain its dominance with Intel Core. Despite facing stiff competition from the past few generations of AMD Ryzen processors, none of HP, Dell nor Lenovo have backed AMD\u2019s volume desktop chip with any real conviction.\n\nThis article is part of AEC Magazine\u2019s 2025 Workstation Special report\n\nThat\u2019s not the case with specialist workstation manufacturers, however. For some time now, AMD Ryzen has featured strongly in the portfolios of Boxx, Scan, Armari, Puget Systems and others.\n\nBut the silicon sector moves fast. Intel and AMD recently launched new mainstream processors \u2014 the AMD Ryzen 9000 Series and Intel Core Ultra 200S Series. Both chip families are widely available from specialist workstation manufacturers, which are much more agile when it comes to introducing new tech. We\u2019ve yet to see any AMD Ryzen 9000 or Intel Core Ultra 200S Series workstations from the major OEMs. However, that\u2019s to be expected as their preferred enterprise-focused variants \u2014 AMD Ryzen Pro and Intel Core vPro \u2014 have not launched yet.\n\nWith the \u2018Zen 5\u2019 AMD Ryzen 9000 Series, AMD is starting to take the lead in areas where Intel once ruled supreme\n\nAMD Ryzen 9000 Series \u201cZen 5\u201d\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9000 Series desktop processors, built on AMD\u2019s \u2018Zen 5\u2019 architecture, launched in the second half of 2024 with 6 to 16 cores. AMD continues to use a chiplet-based design, where multiple CCDs (Core Complex Dies) are connected together to form a single, larger processor. The 6 and 8-core models are made from a single CCD, while the 12 and 16-core models comprise two CCDs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new Ryzen processors continue to support simultaneous multi-threading (SMT), AMD\u2019s equivalent to Intel HyperThreading, which enables a single physical core to execute multiple threads simultaneously. This can help boost performance in certain multi-threaded workflows, such as ray trace rendering, but it can also slow things down.\n\nDDR5 memory is standard, up to a maximum of 192 GB. However, the effective data rate (speed) of the memory, expressed in mega transfers per second (MT/s), can vary dramatically depending on the amount of memory installed in your workstation. For example, you can currently get up to 96 GB at 5,600 MT/s, but if you configure the workstation with 128 GB, the speed will drop to 3,600 MT/s. Some motherboards can support even faster 8,000 MT/s memory, though this is currently limited to 48 GB.\n\nAll Ryzen 9000 Series processors come with integrated GPUs, but their performance is limited, making an add-in GPU essential for professional 3D work. They do not include an integrated neural processing unit (NPU) for AI tasks.\n\nThe Ryzen 9000 Series features two classes of processors: the standard Ryzen models, denoted by an X suffix and the Ryzen X3D variants which feature AMD 3D V-Cache technology.\n\nThere are four standard Ryzen 9000 Series models. The top-end AMD Ryzen 9 9950X has 16-cores, 32 threads, and a max boost frequency of 5.7 GHz.\n\nAMD\u2019s cache-rich Ryzen 9000 X3D variants look particularly appealing for select workflows where having superfast access to a large pool of frequently used data makes them shine\n\nThe other processors have slightly lower clock speeds and fewer cores but are considerably cheaper. The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X, for example, has six cores and boosts to 5.4 GHz, but is less than half the price of the Ryzen 9 9950X. The full line up can be seen in the table right.\n\nThe Ryzen X3D lineup features significantly larger L3 caches than standard Ryzen processors. This increased cache size gives the CPU fast access to more data, instead of having to fetch the data from slower system memory (RAM). The flagship 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D features 128 MB of cache, but the 3D V-Cache is limited to one of its two CCDs.\n\nAll the new \u2018Zen 5\u2019 Ryzen 9000 chips are more power efficient than the previous generation \u2018Zen 4\u2019 Ryzen 7000 Series. This has allowed AMD to reduce the Thermal Design Power (TDP) on a few of the standard Ryzen models. The top-end 16-core processors \u2014 the Ryzen 9 9950X and Ryzen 9 9950X3D \u2014 both have a TDP of 170W and a peak power of 230W. All the others are rated at 65W or 120W.\n\nIntel Core Ultra 200S \u201cArrow Lake\u201d\n\nIntel Core Ultra marks a departure from Intel\u2019s traditional generational numbering system (e.g., 14th Gen). But the Intel Core Ultra 200S (codenamed Arrow Lake) is not just an exercise in branding. It marks a major change in the design of its desktop processors, moving to a tiled architecture (Intel\u2019s term for chiplets).\n\nLike 14th Gen Intel Core, the Intel Core Ultra 200S features two different types of cores: Performance-cores (P-cores) for primary tasks and slower Efficient-cores (E-cores) for background processing.\n\nIn a bold move, Intel has dropped Hyper-Threading from the design, a feature that was previously supported on the P-cores in 14th Gen Intel Core.\n\nLike AMD, DDR5 memory is standard, with a maximum capacity of 192 GB. However, the data rate doesn\u2019t vary as much depending on the amount installed. For instance, with 64 GB, the speed reaches 5,600 MT/s, while with 128 GB, it only drops slightly to 4,800 MT/s.\n\nThe integrated GPU has been improved, but most 3D workflows will still require an add-in GPU. For AI tasks, there\u2019s an integrated NPU, but at 13 TOPS it\u2019s not powerful enough to meet Microsoft\u2019s requirements for Windows Copilot+.\n\nThe processor family includes three main models. At the high end, the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K features 8 P-cores and 16 E-cores. The P-cores operate at a base frequency of 3.7 GHz, with a maximum Turbo of 5.7 GHz. It has a base power of 125 W and draws 250 W at peak.\n\nAt the entry level, the Intel Core Ultra 5 245K offers 6 P-cores and 8 E-cores, with a base frequency of 4.2 GHz and a max Turbo of 5.2 GHz. It has a base power of 125 W, rising to 159 W under Turbo. The full lineup is detailed further up the page.\n\nTest setup\n\nFor our testing, we focused on the flagship models from each standard processor family: the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X (16 cores, 32 threads) and the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K (8 P-cores, 16 E-cores). We also included the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D (8 cores, 16 threads) which, at the time, was the most powerful Ryzen 9000 Series chip with 3D V-Cache. At CES a few weeks ago, AMD announced the 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X3D and the 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D but these 3D V-Cache processors were not available for testing.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and Intel Core Ultra 9 285K were housed in very similar workstations \u2014 both from specialist UK manufacturer, Scan. Apart from the CPUs and motherboards, the other specifications were almost identical.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D workstation came from Armari. All machines featured different GPUs, but our tests focused on CPU processing, so this shouldn\u2019t impact performance. The full specs can be seen below. Testing was done on Windows 11 Pro 26100 with power plan set to high-performance.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 9950X\n\nScan 3XS GWP-A1-R32 workstation (See review)\n\n\n\n\u2022 Motherboard: Asus Pro Art B650 Creator\n\n\u2022 Memory: 64 GB (2 x 32 GB) Corsair DDR5 (5,600 MT/s)\n\n\u2022 GPU: Nvidia RTX 4500 Ada Gen\n\n\u2022 Storage: 2TB Corsair MP700 Pro SSD\n\n\u2022 Cooling: Corsair Nautilus 360 cooler\n\n\u2022 PSU: Corsair RM750e PSU\n\nIntel Core Ultra 9 285K\n\nScan 3XS GWP-A1-C24 workstation (See review)\n\n\u2022 Motherboard: Asus Prime Z890-P\n\n\u2022 Memory: 64 GB (2 x 32 GB) Corsair DDR5 (5,600 MT/s)\n\n\u2022 GPU: Nvidia RTX 2000 Ada Gen\n\n\u2022 Storage: 2TB Corsair MP700 Pro SSD\n\n\u2022 Cooling: Corsair Nautilus 360 cooler\n\n\u2022 PSU: Corsair RM750e PSU AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n\nArmari Magnetar MM16R9 workstation (See review)\n\n\u2022 Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix AMD B650E-I Gaming WiFi Mini-ITX |\n\n\u2022 Memory: 96 GB (2 x 48 GB) Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000C30 EXPO (5,600 MT/s)\n\n\u2022 GPU: AMD Radeon Pro W7500\n\n\u2022 Storage: 2TB Samsung 990 Pro SSD\n\n\u2022 Cooling: Armari SPX-A6815NGR 280mm AIO+NF-P14 redex\n\n\u2022 PSU: Thermaltake Toughpower SFX 850W ATX3.0 Gen5\n\nOn test\n\nWe tested all three workstations with a range of real-world applications used in AEC and product development. Where data existed, and was relevant, we also compared performance figures from older generation processors. This included mainstream models (12th, 13th and 14th Gen Intel Core, AMD Ryzen 7000) and high-end workstation processors (AMD Ryzen 7000 Threadripper and Threadripper Pro, Intel Xeon W-3400, and 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable).\n\nData for AMD Threadripper came from standard and overclocked workstations. In the benchmark charts, 90\u00b0C refers to the max temp set in the Armari Magnetar M64T7 \u2018Level 1\u2019 PBO (see Workstation Special Report 2024), while 900W refers to power draw of the processor in the Comino Grando workstation (read our review).\n\nThe comparisons aren\u2019t entirely apples-to-apples \u2014 older machines were tested with different versions of Windows 11, as well as varying memory, storage, and cooling configurations. However, the results should still provide a solid approximation of relative performance.\n\nCAD and BIM\n\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes Solidworks (CAD) and Autodesk Revit (BIM) are bread and butter tools for designers, engineers, and architects. For the most part, these applications are single-threaded, although some processes are able to utilise a few CPU cores. Ray-trace rendering stands out as the exception, taking full advantage of all available cores.\n\nIn the Autodesk Revit 2025 RFO v3 benchmark the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X came out top in the model creation and export tests, in which Intel has traditionally held an edge. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D performed respectably, but with its slightly lower maximum frequency, lagged behind a little.\n\nIn Solidworks 2022, things were much more even. In the rebuild, convert, and simulate subtests of the SPECapc benchmark, there was little difference between the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K. However, in the mass properties and boolean subtests, the Ryzen 9 9950X pulled ahead, only to be outshined by the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Despite the 9800X3D having a lower clock speed, it looks like the additional cache provides a significant performance boost.\n\nBut how do the new chips compare to older generation processors? Our data shows that while there are improvements, the performance gains are not huge.\n\nAMD\u2019s performance increases ranged from 7% to 22% generation-on-generation, although the Ryzen 9 9950X was 9% slower in the mass properties test. Intel\u2019s improvements were more modest, with a maximum gain of just 9%. In fact, in three tests, the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K was up to 19% slower than its predecessor.\n\nLooking back over the last three years, Intel\u2019s progress appears incremental. Compared to the Intel Core i9-12900K, launched in late 2021, the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K is only up to 26% faster.\n\nRay trace rendering\n\nRay trace rendering is exceptionally multithreaded, so can take full advantage of all CPU cores. Unsurprisingly, the processors with the highest core counts \u2014 the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X (16 cores) and Intel Core Ultra 9 285K (24 cores) \u2014 topped our tests.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9950X outperformed the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K in several benchmarks, delivering faster performance in V-Ray (17%), CoronaRender (15%), and KeyShot (11%). Intel\u2019s decision to drop Hyper-Threading may have contributed to this performance gap, though Intel still claimed a slight lead in Cinebench, with a 5% advantage.\n\nGen-on-gen improvements were modest. Intel showed gains of 4% to 17%, while AMD delivered between 5% and 11% faster performance.\n\nWe also ran stress tests to assess sustained performance. In several hours of rendering in V-Ray, the Ryzen 9 9950X held steady at 4.91 GHz, while the Ryzen 9 9800X3D maintained 5.17 GHz. Meanwhile, the P-cores of the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K reached 4.86 GHz.\n\nPower consumption is another important consideration. The Ryzen 9 9950X drew 200W, whereas the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K peaked at 240W \u2014 slightly lower than its predecessor, 14th Gen Intel Core.\n\nSince rendering scales exceptionally well with higher core counts, the best performance is achieved with high-end workstation processors like AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro.\n\nSimulation (FEA and CFD)\n\nEngineering simulation encompasses Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), both of which are extremely demanding computationally.\n\nFEA and CFD utilise a variety of solvers, each with unique behaviours, and performance can vary depending on the dataset. Generally, CFD scales well with additional CPU cores, allowing studies to solve significantly faster. Moreover, CFD performance benefits greatly from higher memory bandwidth, making these factors critical for optimal results.\n\nFor our testing, we selected three workloads from the SPECworkstation 3.1 benchmark and one from SPECworkstation 4.0. The CFD tests included Rodinia (representing compressible flow), WPCcfd (modelling combustion and turbulence), and OpenFoam with XiFoam solver. For FEA, we used CalculiX, which simulates the internal temperature of a jet engine turbine.\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra 9 285K claimed the top spot in all the tests. The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X followed in second place, except in the OpenFoam benchmark, where it was outperformed by the Ryzen 9 9800X3D\u2014 likely due to the additional cache.\n\nOf course, for those deeply invested in simulation, high-end workstation processors, such as AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro and Intel Xeon offer a significant advantage, thanks to their higher core counts and superior memory bandwidth. For a deeper dive, check out last year\u2019s workstation special report.\n\nReality modelling\n\nReality modelling is becoming prevalent in the AEC sector. Raw data captured by drones (photographs / video) and terrestrial laser scanners must be turned in point clouds and reality meshes \u2014 a process that is very computationally intensive.\n\nWe tested a range of workflows using three popular tools: Leica Cyclone 3DR, Leica Cyclone Register 360, and RealityCapture by Capturing Reality, a subsidiary of Epic Games.\n\nAs many of the workflows in these applications are multi-threaded, we were surprised that the 8-core AMD Ryzen 9800X3D outperformed the 16-core AMD Ryzen 9950X and 24-core Intel Core Ultra 9 285K in several tests. This is likely due to its significantly larger cache, but possibly down to its single CCD design, which houses all 8 CPU cores.\n\nIn contrast, the 16-core AMD Ryzen 9950X, which is made up of two 8-core CCDs, may suffer from latency when cores from different CCDs need to communicate with each other. It will be interesting to see how the recently announced 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X3D and 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D compare.\n\nThe other point worth noting is the impact of memory speed. In some workflows we experienced dramatically faster computation with faster memory. Simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) also had an impact on performance.\n\nWe explore reality modelling in much more detail in this in-depth article.\n\nThe verdict\n\nFor the past few years, Intel and AMD have been battling it out in the mainstream processor market. Intel has traditionally dominated single threaded and lightly threaded workflows like CAD, BIM, and reality modelling, while AMD has been the go-to choice for multithreaded rendering.\n\nBut the landscape is shifting. With the \u2018Zen 5\u2019 AMD Ryzen 9000 Series, AMD is starting to take the lead in areas where Intel once ruled supreme. For instance, in Solidworks CAD, AMD is delivering solid generation-on-generation performance improvements, while Intel appears to be stagnating. In fact, some workflows show the Intel Core Ultra 200S trailing behind older 14th Gen Intel Core processors.\n\nThat said, for most workstation users, AMD\u2019s rising stock won\u2019t mean much unless major OEMs like Dell, HP, and Lenovo start giving Ryzen the same level of attention they\u2019ve devoted to AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro. A lot will depend on AMD releasing Pro variants of the Ryzen 9000 Series to meet the needs of enterprise users.\n\nFor everyone else relying on specialist manufacturers, workstations with the latest Intel and AMD chips are already available. This includes AMD\u2019s cache-rich Ryzen 9000 X3D variants, which look particularly appealing for select workflows where having superfast access to a large pool of frequently used data makes them shine.\n\nThis article is part of AEC Magazine\u2019s 2025 Workstation Special report\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Subscribe here",

            "content": "\n\n\n\nIntel's (INTC 0.59%) fourth-quarter results topped analysts' expectations but also showed a company that continues to struggle to find its footing. Its revenues once again declined, and it delayed an important chip launch. The stock is down more than 50% over the past year.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the semiconductor company's Q4 results, and whether it can pull off a turnaround.\n\nRevenue declines and foundry losses\n\nFor the third consecutive quarter, Intel saw its revenue decline. For Q4, revenue dropped 7% year over year to $14.3 billion while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) plunged 76% to $0.13.\n\nNonetheless, the results topped the analyst consensus calling for adjusted EPS of $0.12 on revenue of $13.8 billion.\n\nGross margin, meanwhile, fell by 650 basis points from 45.7% to 39.2%.\n\nIntel's product segment saw revenue fall 6% to $13 billion. Within the segment, the client computing group's revenue declined by 9% to $8 billion. This unit is home to Intel's core personal computer CPU (central processing unit) business. It said it is on track to ship 100 million cumulative artificial intelligence (AI) PCs by the end of 2025, and that it will launch its new Panther Lake chip in the second half.\n\nIntel's data center and AI unit, meanwhile, saw sales decline 3% to $3.4 billion, while its network and edge unit saw sales decline by 10% to $1.6 billion. The company is working on closing competitive gaps within the data center and has a number of upcoming data center CPU launches over the next two years to help in that regard. However, it is pushing back the expected launch of its important Clearwater Forest data center processor to the first half of 2026.\n\nOverall, operating income for Intel's product segment fell 18% to $3.6 billion. Nearly $3.1 billion of that comes from CCG, which saw its operating income drop by 14%.\n\nIntel's foundry segment, meanwhile, continued to struggle. Foundry revenue fell by 13% to $4.5 billion. The segment's operating loss expanded from $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion. It is looking to be breakeven in this segment by the end of 2027, helped by improved efficiencies and internal and EUV (extreme ultraviolet) wafers.\n\nClient Computing Data center Network and edge Product segment Foundry segment Revenue $8 billion $3.4 billion $1.6 billion $13 billion $4.5 billion Revenue Growth -9% -3% -10% -6% -13%\n\nThe company generated $8.3 billion in operating cash flow during 2024, but it spent $23.9 billion in capital expenditures (capex) as it continues to build out its foundry operations. It ended the year with $50 billion in debt against $22.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. It also has $7.86 billion in grants from the U.S. Department of Commerce to build out its foundries in the U.S.\n\nLooking ahead, Intel forecast first-quarter revenue to be between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion, compared to revenue of $12.7 billion a year ago. It's looking for 36% gross margin, down 910 basis points year over year, and adjusted EPS of $0.00, compared to $0.18 last year. It plans to lower its 2025 capex to around $20 billion.\n\nIntel plans to focus on monetizing non-core assets to help pay down debt. This includes selling a stake in Altera and potentially IPOing the unit down the road.\n\nCan Intel's stock rebound?\n\nIntel continues to be challenged. It still has a solid position in PCs, but it's struggled to make bigger inroads in the fast-growing data center market. The delay of its Clearwater Forest CPUs for data centers, which use its new 18A technology, is a big disappointment. This likely pushes back the chance of the company regaining data center CPU market share until at least next year. Meanwhile, the delay likely helps rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which has been taking share in data center CPUs.\n\nIntel's foundry business remains a drag, as it continues to rack up losses and drain cash flow due to its heavy capex costs. However, these are real assets it is buying, and the unit is a hidden value within the company.\n\nTurning to valuation, Intel trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 16 based on 2025 analyst estimates. However, its foundry losses obscure the lower valuation of Intel's underlying core business. In 2024, Intel's product segment generated $13.1 billion in operating income, which would equate to EPS of about $2.27 (assuming a 25% tax rate and 4.33 billion shares). As such, its core business is trading at about 8.6 times 2024 core EPS.\n\nMeanwhile, in just the last three years, it has spent $74.5 billion in capex, mostly on its Foundry unit. If you subtract Intel's net debt from that, this unit can be valued at $10.50 per Intel share based on the value of its physical assets minus debt. Its stakes in Mobileye and Altera also have some value.\n\nThus, while Intel continues to have its fair share of struggles, I do think there's still some good hidden value with its share price at current levels that it may be able to unlock in the near future.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently pointed out some unexpected trends in the stock market this year, spotlighting a group of companies that have largely flown under the radar. These stocks, often overshadowed by the heavily discussed \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d, the dominant tech giants, are making significant gains without the fanfare. Cramer called them \u201cquiet winners,\u201d emphasizing that many of these stocks, particularly those outside the tech sector, are not getting the recognition they deserve from Wall Street.\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Highlighted Buying Opportunities in 13 Stocks\n\nCramer elaborated further on this point, noting that the leading stocks in 2025 have emerged from an unexpected mix of sectors, making this trend all the more interesting. Cramer remarked that it is clear that there is a shift happening in the market, with industries beyond tech making significant strides, yet remaining largely underappreciated by the broader investing community.\n\n\u201cSo far this year, we\u2019ve had many very big winners outside of tech, and I bet most of them can keep quietly working their way higher.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that the insurance industry has experienced a particularly strong few years, noting its impressive pricing power, which has translated into higher premiums. This, in turn, has allowed insurance companies to invest those premiums in the bond market, generating significant returns.\n\nAdditionally, Cramer argued that the market often gets the most obvious things wrong, which ends up costing investors dearly. In his usual candid style, Cramer emphasized that while no investment is entirely foolproof, certain stocks show more resilience than others. \u201cThe key is to buy them when they\u2019re down because they won\u2019t stay down for long,\u201d he advised.\n\nHe continued, acknowledging that some stocks have stumbled recently, but he believes that many of the non-tech winners from this year still have room to grow. His message to investors was clear: focus on these quieter, non-tech stocks, as they have the potential to deliver strong returns even as the tech sector struggles with occasional setbacks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 6. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.",

            "content": "This article discusses the 2025 Intel Arrow Lake HX mobile microarchitecture, meant for high-performance workstations and gaming laptops.\n\nThis follows up on the Intel 13th-gen and 14th-gen Raptor Lake hardware, introducing Core Ultra 9 200HX (and lower) processors as successors for the Core i9 HX platforms implemented in performance computers from 2023/2024. It\u2019s also the Intel alternative to AMD\u2019s Fire Range HX hardware for 2025.\n\nDesign-wise, the Core Ultra 9 HX hardware is still a hybrid implementation with Performance and Efficiency Cores, but new-generation Cores (Lion Cove P-Cores, Skymont E-Cores) with a new overall die design. More on that further down.\n\nOverall, based on what we know at this point, Arrow Lake HX hardware shows a slight uplift in sustained performance over Raptor Lake, as well as minimally improved framerates in games in certain scenarios. We\u2019re looking at 5-20% between use cases. On top of these, Arrow Lake HX is also significantly more efficient on battery power than Arrow Lake, with multiple implications.\n\nHowever, what matters perhaps even more is the fact that Arrow Lake HX processors are paired with Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5000 Blackwell graphics chips and implemented in many new devices with improved cooling and features over their predecessors.\n\nLet\u2019s go a little more in-depth over the hardware platform, and then we\u2019ll go through the lists of notebooks available today that are built on Arrow Lake HX hardware.\n\nArrow Lake HX hardware particularities\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Arrow Lake HX hardware is a hybrid design with Lion Cove Performance Cores and Skymont Efficiency Cores, built on TSMC\u2019s 6 nm N6 node. These are the same cores implemented by the Arrow Lake H and Lunar Lake V platforms, but in different amounts and with a different overall CPU design.\n\nIn a few words, the Arrow Lake HX chiplets allocate most space on the tile for the CPU, with up to 24 Cores/ 24 Threads and 36 MB of L3 Cache, with a TDP of 55+ W sustained. While the XoC and IO tiles are built on TSMC\u2019s 6nm 6N processor, the Compute Tile is completely redesigned over Raptor Lake, and built on TSMC\u2019s 3nm N3B process. There\u2019s still an iGPU in there, but a smaller one with limited capabilities and built on older generation Xe-LPG graphics, not on the Xe2 architecture implemented by Lunar Lake V and Arrow Lake H processors.\n\nThe NPU isn\u2019t much either, at around 13 TOPS peak \u2013 perhaps some would have expected an Intel AI NPU 4 that would have made the platform Copilot+ certified and would have offered improved capabilities for AI workloads. That NPU is included with Lunar Lake hardware, but not with Arrow Lake. However, this is more than compensated by the massive processing power offered by the latest Nvidia GPUs.\n\nOverall, these make sense for a platform designed to be implemented in high-power high-performance mobile computers alongside a dedicated GPU.\n\nOn the Performance Cores side, Core Ultra 200HX processors implement up to 8x P-Cores arranged around a common ring-bus interconnect, with dedicated L2 Cache memory and up to 36 L3 Cache memory shared among all cores. The Lion Cove cores lack HyperThreading by design, to keep the die size in check and improve efficiency to some extent. This approach also allowed Intel to completely redesign the chiplet, as explained more in-depth in this article.\n\nOn the Efficiency Cores side, up to 16x Skymont E-Cores are implemented on the Core Ultra 9 HX processors, arranged around the same Compute ring-bus as the P-Cores and sharing the same L3 Cache memory. Intel claims IPC gains for Skymont E-Cores over Gracement E-Cores of up to 20-30%, allowing in this way the CPU to mitigate the lack of HyperThreading on the P-Cores when it comes to multi-threaded sustained performance, and even surpass Raptor Lake implementations by a fair amount.\n\nA few other aspects are worth mentioning as well, mostly around the improved I/O on this hardware. Among others, it allows for CPU-attached gen5 SSDs. High-speed CUDIMM memory is not supported by the mobile platform in this generation, that\u2019s exclusive to the desktop Raptor Lake S hardware.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick summary of the Arrow Lake HX Core Ultra 9 and Ultra 7 processors, and I\u2019ve also included the 14th-gen and 13th-gen i9 mobile processors for comparison, although comparing the two platforms this way doesn\u2019t make much sense, as explained earlier.\n\nCore\n\nUltra 9 285HX Core\n\nUltra 9 275HX Core\n\nUltra 7 255HX Core\n\ni9-14900HX Core\n\ni9-13980HX Core\n\ni9-13900HX Lithography TSMC 6N Intel 7 Design TDP 55-160W 55-157W Cores (P+E)/Threads 8+16/24 8+16/24 8+12/20 8+16/32 8+16/32 8+16/32 P-Cores max Turbo 5.5 GHz 5.4 GHz 5.2 GHz 5.8 GHz 5.6 GHz 5.4 GHz E-Cores max Turbo 4.6 GHz 4.6 GHz 4.5 GHz 4.1 GHz 4.0 GHz 3.9 GHz Graphics Intel XeG 4Xe Cores,\n\nup to 1.95 GHz UHD 32 EUs,\n\nup to 1.65 GHz Cache 36 MB Smart cache 36 MB Smart cache Memory support\n\nDDR5-6400 DDR4-3200, DDR5-5600\n\nAnd this is the complete lineup of Core Ultra 200HX processors.\n\nAll in all, expect Arrow Lake HX laptops to offer an uplift in general performance over the previous-gen Raptor Lake HX hardware. More importantly, perhaps, the hardware is implemented in a handful of fresh designs for 2025, with updated builds and ergonomics, the fastest Nvidia RTX Blackwell graphics, as well as the latest features and novelties available today.\n\nAt the same time, aside from the sustained performance, Arrow Lake HX hardware should benefit from a notable increase in efficiency on battery power, both for casual use and demanding activities away from the wall. Furthermore, with the actual CPU die size being ~30% smaller than with Raptor Lake, we could expect Core Ultra HX hardware implemented successfully in some portable formats as well, alongside the expected heavyweight desktop replacement notebooks.\n\nI\u2019d also expect interesting behavior on lower-power and quiet profiles, something I\u2019m especially interested in when playing games these days. We\u2019ll know more about it once we get to review some of these 2025 notebooks.\n\nList of all laptops built on Intel Arrow Lake HX (Core Ultra 200HX) hardware\n\nThis section lists all the available notebooks built on Arrow Lake Core Ultra 200HX hardware.\n\nMost of them are full-size full-performance laptops meant for serious workloads and gaming, with either premium-tier chassis with the latest and greatest features (such as miniLED or OLED displays, mechanical keyboards, vapor chamber cooling, lots of RGB bars and elements), or more budget-friendly models with mid-tier specs and features.\n\nHowever, you\u2019ll also find this Intel HX hardware implemented in a handful of more compact and lightweight all-around laptops, the kind you can still comfortably grab along to work/school and won\u2019t draw unwanted attention with their chassis design.\n\nAs far as what\u2019s the Best Intel Arrow Lake HX laptop of this list, that\u2019s going to vary based on your needs and expectations. Among the heavyweights peformers, though, I\u2019d look into the MSI Titan 18 and the Asus ROG Scar 18 first, while among more compact and even more affordable 16-inch models, the updated Lenovo Legion Pro and Asus ROG Strix models are worth your attention. We\u2019ll know more about them once we get to review them, so stay around for our updated articles.\n\nWe\u2019re updating the list as it goes.\n\nModel Screen Hardware (*up to) Graphics (*up to) Weight Acer Predator Helios 16 AI 16-inch 16:10 OLED, glossy\n\n2.5K 240Hz 1ms Intel Core Ultra 275HX,\n\n2x DDR5 slots, 2x SSDs GeForce RTX 5090 (175W),\n\nMUX from\n\n6 lbs / 2.73 kg premium full-size performance and gaming chassis, all-metal build, Predator design elements and RGB elements;\n\n16:10 OLED 2.5K 240Hz 1ms panel, glossy;\n\nper-key RGB keyboard with mechanical switches for WASD and arrow keys;\n\ngood IO \u2013 most ports on the back edge, including Thunderbolt 5; WiFi 7;\n\ndual-fan cooling with quad-exhausts, multiple heatpipes;\n\n90 Wh battery, 330W charger,\n\n4x speakers, 2MP IR camera Price: \u2013 Acer Predator Helios 18 AI 18-inch 16:10 mini LED, matte\n\n4K 120Hz 7ms Intel Core Ultra 275HX,\n\n2x DDR5 slots, 2x SSDs GeForce RTX 5090 (175W),\n\nMUX from\n\n7.1 lbs / 3.2 kg 18-inch variant of the Helios 16, with 6x speakers and slightly beefed up cooling,\n\npremium full-size performance and gaming chassis, all-metal build, RGB elements;\n\n16:10 mini LED 4K 120Hz 7ms panel, matte\n\n99Wh battery, 400W charger,\n\n6x speakers, 2MP IR camera Price: \u2013 Acer Predator Helios 16S AI 16-inch 16:10 OLED, glossy\n\n2.5K 240Hz 3ms Intel Core Ultra 275HX,\n\n2x DDR5 slots, 2x SSDs GeForce RTX 5070Ti (175W),\n\nMUX from\n\n6 lbs / 2.73 kg thinner and lighter version of the regular Helios 16, all-round laptops with metal chassis;\n\n16:10 OLED 2.5K 240Hz 3ms panel, glossy; 4-zone RGB keyboard;\n\nup to Core Ultra 9 with RTX 5070Ti Max-Q, lower power than the full Helios 16;\n\ndual-fan cooling with quad-exhausts, multiple heatpipes;\n\n76 Wh battery, 230W charger,\n\n2x speakers, 2MP IR camera Price: \u2013 Alienware 16 Area 51 16-inch 16:10 IPS, matte\n\n2.5K 240Hz 3ms Intel Core Ultra 275HX,\n\n2x DDR5 slots, 3x SSDs GeForce RTX 5090 (175W),\n\nMUX up to\n\n7.6 lbs / 3.45 kg premium full-size performance and gaming chassis, all-metal build, Alienware design elements and RGB elements;\n\n16:10 IPS 2.5K 240Hz 3ms panel, matte \u2013 no miniLED or OLED option;\n\nper-key RGB keyboard with optional Cherry MX low-profile mechanical switches; optional RGB glass touchpad;\n\ngood IO, mostly on the back edge, including Thunderbolt 5; WiFi 7;\n\nupdated dual-fan cooling with quad-exhausts, multiple heatpipes;\n\n96 Wh battery, up to 380W charger,\n\n4x speakers, 2MP or 8 MP IR camera Price: from $1999 Alienware 18 Area 51 18-inch 16:10 IPS, matte\n\n2.5K 300Hz 3ms Intel Core Ultra 275HX,\n\n2x DDR5 slots, 3x SSDs GeForce RTX 5090 (175W),\n\nMUX up to\n\n9.8 lbs / 4.46 kg larger 18-inch variant of the Alienware 16,\n\n16:10 IPS 2.5K 300Hz 3ms panel, matte;\n\n2.5H Lan port only on this 18-inch model Price: from $2199 Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 16-inch 16:10 mini LED, matte\n\n2.5K 240Hz 3ms Intel Core Ultra 275HX,\n\n2x DDR5 slots, 2x SSDs GeForce RTX 5090 (175W),\n\nMUX from\n\n6.3 lbs / 2.85 kg premium full-size performance and gaming chassis, all-metal build, ROG design elements and RGB elements;\n\n16:10 mini LED 2.5K 240Hz 3ms panel, matte;\n\nper-key RGB keyboard without NumPad; glass touchpad;\n\ngood IO \u2013 all on the sides, including Thunderbolt 5; WiFi 7;\n\nupdated tri-fan cooling with rear heatsink and vapor chamber + heatpipes;\n\n90 Wh battery, up to 380W charger,\n\n4x speakers, 2MP IR camera Price: from $2499 Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 18-inch 16:10 mini LED, matte\n\n2.5K 240Hz 3ms Intel Core Ultra 275HX,\n\n2x DDR5 slots, 2x SSDs GeForce RTX 5090 (175W),\n\nMUX from\n\n7.7 lbs / 3.5 kg 18-inch version of the Scar 16, with larger chassis and slightly beefed-up cooling;\n\nkeyboard with NumPad section;\n\nsame other features and specs as the Scar 16 Price: from $2599 Asus ROG Strix G16 16-inch 16:10 IPS, matte\n\n2.5K 240Hz 3ms Intel Core Ultra 275HX,\n\n2x DDR5 slots, 2x SSDs GeForce RTX 5080 (175W),\n\nMUX from\n\n6 lbs / 2.73 kg mid-tier full-size performance and gaming chassis, a more basic version of the Scar 16, lighter weight and with less RGB;\n\n16:10 IPS 2.5K 240Hz 3ms panel, matte \u2013 mini LED only on the Scar;\n\n4-zone or per-key RGB keyboard without NumPad; glass ??

There's been ARM CPU support too while for this week's ISPC 1.26 release the ARM processor support is much better positioned. In fact, better ARM support is the primary improvement with Intel ISPC 1.26.ISPC 1.26 when targeting ARM with \"--arch=arm\" will now map to ARMv8 rather than ARMv7. There are also new CPU definitions for the Arm Cortex A78, A55, A510, A520, A9, and A15. Plus support for newer Apple Silicon devices too.Intel ISPC 1.26 for ARM also introduces new double-pumped targets of neon-i16x16 and neon-i8x32, dot product operations are now supported using native ARM instructions, and the ARMv8 performance is said to be around 13% faster than prior ISPC releases.\n\nIntel ISPC 1.26 also introduces new generic targets for different CPU architectures, which makes it easier adding RISC-V and other LLVM-supported CPU targets. ISPC 1.26 also brings some language enhancements, various code generation improvements, dropping the Xeon Phi Knights Landing target, and various fixes.Downloads and more details on this week's ISPC 1.26 release via GitHub",

However, Intel\u2019s concerns about its young and ambitious competitor were already evident. Few could have imagined that just a few years later, Nvidia would be trading at a valuation of $3.5 trillion as the world\u2019s largest company, while Intel would be worth only $80 billion.\n\nLast week, along with reporting disappointing financial results, Intel announced that its next-generation Habana processor, Falcon Shores, had received negative feedback from customers and would therefore not be marketed commercially. This follows an earlier announcement, about six months ago, that Gaudi had failed to meet expectations of reaching $500 million in revenue by 2024. As a result, Intel decided not to develop another generation of Gaudi beyond the existing Gaudi 3. This effectively marks the failure of Habana Labs as another entry in Intel\u2019s long history of unsuccessful acquisitions. While this outcome may not be surprising for Intel, it is an unusual event in the track record of Avigdor Willenz, the Israeli entrepreneur behind Habana.\n\n1 View gallery Habana Labs founder Avigdor Willenz and Intel offices. ( Photos: Eyal Toueg and Nir Keidar )\n\nWillenz, considered a genius in the semiconductor world, has a long history of successful exits. His achievements include the sale of Galileo to Marvell for $2.7 billion in 2000, an acquisition that significantly boosted Marvell\u2019s market position. He later sold Annapurna Labs to Amazon for a relatively modest $350 million\u2014small compared to its current crucial role in Amazon\u2019s cloud operations. More recently, he was one of the founders and early investors in the U.S. company Astera Labs, which went public last year at a valuation of $5.5 billion and is now worth $16 billion. Given his record, Habana Labs' failure is a rare misstep and raises the question: What went wrong? The simple answer is likely Intel itself and its well-documented struggles with acquisitions.\n\nEven before the negative announcements about Gaudi and Falcon Shores, Habana Labs had already disintegrated. By 2024, nearly all of its founders, managers, and engineers had left Intel, most of them immediately after their four-year retention period ended. Many did not even wait for Intel\u2019s voluntary retirement plan. Today, almost none of Habana\u2019s original hardware engineers remain at Intel. Recognizing its difficulties in integrating acquisitions, Intel had previously experimented with keeping acquired companies as separate units. It applied this approach to Mobileye until deciding that the structure was ineffective and spinning it back out as a public company. Habana was also kept as a separate unit until last year, when it was dismantled and absorbed into Intel\u2019s existing operations.\n\nThe beginning, as usual, was optimistic. Unlike some of its past failures\u2014such as missing the mobile revolution\u2014Intel correctly identified AI as the future. Five years ago, the company projected it would generate $25 billion in AI processor revenue by 2024, a target that remains far from reality. As part of its AI push, Intel acquired the startup Nervana for $400 million. Nervana specialized in processors for training language models, but Intel soon realized it had bet on the wrong technology. In 2017, seeing Nvidia\u2019s rapid advancements in GPUs, Intel recruited Raja Koduri, a former AMD executive, to lead its AI efforts. However, customer feedback remained disappointing\u2014Intel\u2019s processors were underpowered and failed to meet market demands.\n\nTo signal its commitment to AI, Intel sought a dramatic move. It attempted to acquire Mellanox but refused to pay the $7 billion that Nvidia ultimately offered in a deal that stunned the industry. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had a clear vision for Mellanox\u2019s strategic importance, while Intel hesitated. After losing out, Intel turned to the second name customers had recommended for competitive AI processors: Habana Labs. Founded in 2016 by David Dahan and Ran Halutz\u2014both veterans of PrimeSense, the Israeli company behind Apple's facial recognition technology\u2014Habana already had a functional AI training processor, Gaudi. Unlike Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, Gaudi was based on a different architecture, and Amazon later claimed it was 40% more efficient than Nvidia\u2019s offering. At the time, Amazon was rumored to be interested in acquiring Habana, but Intel, eager to recover from the Mellanox debacle, was willing to pay more. Intel completed the acquisition in 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and simultaneously shut down Nervana.\n\nNvidia finalized its Mellanox acquisition around the same time, but the outcomes for the two Israeli companies diverged sharply. Nvidia successfully integrated Mellanox, which now generates over $13 billion in annual revenue and employs thousands in Israel. Meanwhile, Habana Labs floundered under Intel\u2019s leadership.\n\nSources who spoke to Calcalist about Habana\u2019s downfall unanimously agree that Intel mismanaged the acquisition by pursuing multiple competing AI strategies without fully committing to any. Some believe Intel acquired Habana simply to cover up Nervana\u2019s failure and signal to investors that it was investing in AI\u2014without necessarily intending to challenge Nvidia through Habana. This was evident in Intel\u2019s organizational structure: Habana was not placed under Koduri\u2019s GPU division (AXG) but instead under the data platform group (DPG). Koduri, a high-profile hire at Intel, wielded significant influence and reportedly received the bulk of development and marketing budgets.\n\n\"From the moment the Habana acquisition was completed, people inside Intel couldn\u2019t understand why the company was running both Habana and the GPU division, which were developing competing architectures,\" said a former Intel executive. Former Habana employees also described Intel\u2019s bureaucratic inefficiencies as a major obstacle. \"At Habana, we could make a decision in a five-minute hallway conversation. At Intel, that same decision required three meetings with dozens of participants, and nothing moved forward,\" one former Habana employee recalled.\n\nUntil 2022, Intel pursued both strategies simultaneously, selling Gaudi processors while also developing its competing GPU, Ponte Vecchio. However, with the rise of ChatGPT and other generative AI models, Nvidia\u2019s dominance became undeniable, and Intel once again received negative customer feedback. Ponte Vecchio was discontinued in 2024, just two years after its launch, and later that year, Intel announced it would not develop new Gaudi generations. In 2022, following Koduri\u2019s departure, Intel attempted to consolidate its efforts by merging Habana and its GPU division to develop a new AI processor, Falcon Shores\u2014a hybrid chip combining a GPU (like Nvidia\u2019s) with a CPU (Intel\u2019s specialty). At Habana, the move was met with skepticism and wry humor: \"Suddenly, they remembered us,\" some employees joked.\n\nNow, it turns out that Falcon Shores has failed to meet expectations and will be used only for Intel\u2019s internal testing. The company is shifting focus to a new chip, Jaguar Shores, attempting to leapfrog several generations to catch up with Nvidia. However, industry experts believe that closing the gap is nearly impossible. Nvidia has spent the last two decades refining its AI processors, while Intel has only recently recognized the opportunity\u2014arriving late, like a sluggish hippopotamus at a sprinting contest.\n\nMeanwhile, the former Habana team, along with Willenz, has already moved on to its next AI venture from new offices in Tel Aviv. They cannot complain too much\u2014Intel paid in cash, and estimates suggest that Willenz, the founders, and the startup\u2019s 100 employees collectively received around $1 billion. But despite the financial windfall, Habana\u2019s failure is a rare blemish on Willenz\u2019s record and, more importantly, a missed opportunity for Israel. With better execution, Habana could have become the foundation of Intel\u2019s AI strategy instead of another casualty of its troubled acquisition history.\n\nIntel said in response: \"Our AI opportunity is centered on solving our customers' most pressing challenges, particularly reducing compute costs and increasing efficiency. A one-size-fits-all approach will not suffice. Instead, we see clear opportunities to leverage our core and existing assets in new ways with the goal of delivering the most compelling total cost of ownership across this continuum.",

During these visits, the high school recruits tour campus, eat plenty of food, sit in on various meetings and of course, spend extended time with the Bulls\u2019 coaching staff.\n\nIn this USF football recruiting intel article, On3\u2019s Mike Singer gives the latest on the Bulls\u2019 efforts in the 2026 class with a focus on the prospects who visited campus in the past few weeks.\n\nThe Bulls have offered a handful of quarterbacks already in the 2026 cycle, and one player emerged on the board in the past week. Seffner (Fla.) Armwood signal-caller Rhys Brush, a 6-2, 175-pounder who holds offers from Old Dominion, Troy, Western Michigan, Yale, Arkansas State and a couple others, visited USF Feb. 1 and earned his offer from the Bulls a few days later. Brush will be a key name to know for quarterback recruiting moving forward.\n\nUSF has a running back pledge already in the 2026 cycle, coming from Fairburn (Ga.) Langston Hughes\u2019 Qwantavius Wiggins. He made it to Tampa Jan. 18, as well as local back Javari Barnett out of Tampa (Fla.) Bay Tech. Miami, Texas A&M and USC are among the offers for Barnett, an On3 four-star prospect. Community School of Naples (Fla.) ball carrier Jayvian Tanelus, another notable target, made it to USF recently as well.\n\nThe Bulls had a huge offensive line recruiting day Feb. 1 with several targets on campus. Washington (D.C.) St. John\u2019s College interior lineman Jordan Harrison was one of them, and he committed to the Bulls over offers from Maryland, West Virginia, Syracuse, Boston College and others on Friday.\n\nThe Bulls offered and hosted Douglasville (Ga.) South Paulding offensive tackle Tyler Chukuyem on that day, and also had Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) Cypress Bay\u2019s Ben Gula, Douglasville (Ga.) Douglas County\u2019s Julius Dumas and Valdosta (Ga.) Lowndes\u2019 Benjamin Corhei in town. The latter three prospects all hold big-time power conference scholarship offers.\n\nUSF had coveted interior defensive linemen and pass rushers on campus in recent weeks. Fleming Island (Fla.) EDGE Jarius Rodgers, a four-star prospect who ranks as the No. 258 player and No. 25 EDGE in America per the 2026 On3 Industry Ranking, was in Tampa Jan. 18 but committed to Syracuse nine days later. It would be a surprise if USF stopped recruiting Rodgers, who is a top overall target for Golesh and Co. in the 2026 class.\n\nBulls\u2019 EDGE commit Dematrius Geathers from Boca Raton (Fla.) West Boca Raton made it back to his future school Feb. 1. Kissimmee (Fla.) Osceola interior defensive lineman Amier Clarke earned an offer from the Bulls while on campus Jan. 18.\n\nThe Bulls hosted impressive in-state linebacker prospects, including Orlando (Fla.) Edgewater\u2019s Justin Edwards, Daytona Beach (Fla.) Mainland\u2019s Dennis King and Ponte Vedra Beach (Fla.) Nease\u2019s Jacob Curry. USF has yet to offer Curry, but it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if he landed one in the near future.\n\nUSF had several key defensive backs on targets, including local two-way star DJ Williams from Carrollwood Day in Tampa. The cornerback prospect has Miami, Ole Miss, Notre Dame, Florida State and others on his offer sheet and regularly visits USF. Another prospect who checks out USF regularly and is armed with big-time offers is Tarpon Springs (Fla.) High\u2019s CJ Cresser, a Rivals three-star cornerback.\n\nBradenton (Fla.) IMG Academy four-star safety Amari Jones, who is being targeted by Auburn, Tennessee, Penn State and others, was at USF Feb. 1.\n\nClearwater (Fla.) High\u2019s Kentrail McRae, Riverview (Fla.) Sumner\u2019s Jamareis Conyers and Seffner (Fla.) Armwood\u2019s D\u2019Montae Tims were the other USF defensive back targets in the 2026 class on campus in the past couple weeks.\n\n\n\n",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer spent nearly all of his show discussing stocks. As has been the case with most of his morning appearances in 2025, he discussed Wall Street's favorite GPU stock in quite a bit of detail. While we've covered a lot of his remarks in our coverage of the stock in our next list, some points are worth mentioning in the introduction.\n\nWhile Wall Street is focused on whether cloud and data center spending for the firm will materialize after China's DeepSeek purportedly demonstrated lower training costs and by effect lower spending requirements, Cramer is focused on the firm's Blackwell GPU.\n\nFor Cramer, while the Blackwell GPU is an impressive product, the timeline of its orders materializing is surprising. He commented on a recent share price target reduction by Citi to share that the only significant takeaway for him from the note concerned the orders. Before he read the note, Cramer kept \"thinking that Blackwell, which is the next generation, is selling like mad.\" However, reading the note surprised him as he learned that the first customer was only starting to receive the products. This leads Cramer to conclude that the money from the latest AI GPUs that the firm earns is \"going to be much more forward and not now in front of us.\"\n\nYet, he remains optimistic because the orders will materialize as Cramer believes \"because obviously if you're spending all this money you're gonna get Blackwell.\" The CNBC host then shifted the conversation to the importance of the Blackwell GPUs. After analyzing the GPU orders, \"you say to yourself, why do you need Blackwell? Why do you need this incredibly important platform that has software?\" he wondered.\n\nThe answer to this question, according to Cramer is because \"you need it [Blackwell] for both inference and you need it for training,\" even though according to him \"There are people who said with DeepSeek you don't.\"\n\nThe GPU orders are particularly important when we analyze Cramer's first remarks for the GPU stock after the DeepSeek stock market selloff. Orders are one key metric that Cramer believes investors should watch to confirm whether the damage done by the selloff is permanent. In a recent morning appearance, he outlined that \"any [GPU] order pullback\" is a key metric along with a potentially reduced focus on energy spending.",

While unconfirmed, the details give us a possible look at what's coming with Panther Lake and Wildcat Lake, two upcoming CPU families that will form the bulk of Intel's mobile lineup in late 2025 and early 2026. The specifications, embedded below, outline core configurations, memory support, AI capabilities, and more.Panther Lake appears to be a high-performance mobile CPU series aimed at laptops and possibly gaming handhelds, succeeding last year's Lunar Lake processors. It will purportedly be the first product on Intel's 18A process node and feature a mix of Cougar Cove P-cores and Darkmont E-cores. It also incorporates Intel's Xe3 \"Celestial\" graphics, with core counts varying between models, and could push AI acceleration further with up to 180 TOPS across CPU, NPU, and GPU.Notably, all of the leaked Panther Lake models are indicated to be \"-H\" series CPUs, suggesting power targets between 28W and 45W. That's surprising in the case of the design with just 4 P-cores and 4 LP E-cores, like Lunar Lake, especially considering that Lunar Lake had eight Xe2 cores \u2014although it's possible that Xe3 is once again wider than Xe2 (as Battlemage's Xe2 was wider than the original Xe architecture as seen in Alchemist.)Lunar Lake, the predecessor to Panther Lake, was an experiment of sorts that used an advanced memory-on-package design to improve power efficiency, but that approach proved too costly for widespread adoption. With Panther Lake, Intel appears to be pivoting back to more traditional memory configurations, though the leaked specs still hint at high-end memory support, including LPDDR5X-8533 and DDR5-7200. The use of high-speed DDR5 in what should be SODIMMs is particularly interesting, possibly indicating the adoption of CSODIMM or even CAMM2 memory Wildcat Lake, by contrast, remains more mysterious. It's expected to be an ultra-low-power successor to Alder Lake-N , targeting devices like low-cost laptops or Chromebooks as well as embedded applications. The specs show a maximum of two P-cores and four LP-cores, possibly with Xe3 graphics, suggesting it could be a highly efficient but still capable processor for lightweight devices. Wildcat Lake is thought to be coming to market early next year.The relatively modest P-core counts in Panther Lake (maxing out at four, according to Jaykihn's information ) could indicate a shift in Intel's mobile strategy, prioritizing efficiency and AI performance over raw multicore scaling. As the test case for Intel's critical 18A process, Panther Lake could be one of the most important Intel launches in a decade. All eyes are on Intel's foundry to see if it can keep up with its rivals in Asia.",

            "content": "Although Microsoft founder Bill Gates sat down for an interview with The Associated Press to discuss his new memoir, \u201cSource Code: My Beginnings,\u201d he also shared his views on a variety of other topics, including vaccine conspiracy views about him, his thoughts on the struggles of longtime computer chipmaker Intel and his take on the antitrust challenges facing Google.\n\nHaving poured billions of dollars into diseases such as polio and malaria through his foundation, Gates was dumbfounded about the conspiracy theories that erupted during the pandemic about the COVID-19 vaccine being tied to his efforts to kill people or other sinister agendas.\n\nAlthough he remains puzzled by it all, Gates isn\u2019t too worried yet, even if outspoken vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is confirmed as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cThings don\u2019t always go in a straight line,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIf you had said to me that at a time where we\u2019ve cut child\u2019s deaths in half since the turn of the century, and the main reason is vaccines, but their reputation would be more confused today than ever, I would have said, \u2018Are you kidding? These are miracles.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cFor somebody with a logical view like I try to have, it is confounding you have those conspiracy theories. I hope that dies down. I don\u2019t think we will have something bad happen. Because these infectious diseases are at very low levels in the U.S., you don\u2019t have this immediate, \u2018Oh my, God, we didn\u2019t take measles vaccines,\u2019 and sadly, here are these people who died. In Africa, that happens very quickly because measles is everywhere, and kids are malnourished. So it just takes a little bit longer that sadly people have to see deaths before they get reconnected to the miraculous value that vaccines provide.\u201d\n\nGates might have gone down a different career path if Intel hadn\u2019t made the technological breakthroughs that created a tiny chip capable of powering a personal computer during the early 1970s. That advance created the need for programs to use the computer, prompting Gates and Paul Allen to launch Micro-Soft, a name derived from microprocessor and software (the hyphen was later dropped).\n\nThat\u2019s why Gates has a soft spot for Intel, which missed the shift from PCs to smartphones 18 years ago, just as Microsoft did. But Microsoft has bounced back while Intel\u2019s troubles have deteriorated to the point that it\u2019s looking for a new CEO since the abrupt departure of Pat Gelsinger in December, raising worries about whether the company will survive.\n\n\u201cI am stunned that Intel basically lost its way,\u201d Gates said. \u201c(Intel co-founder) Gordon Moore always kept Intel at the state of the art. And now they are kind of behind in terms of chip design and they are kind of behind in chip fabrication. And both of those are very capital intensive. They missed the AI chip revolution, and with their fabrication capabilities, they don\u2019t even use standards that people like Nvidia and Qualcomm find easy. I thought Pat Gelsinger was very brave to say, \u2018No, I am going to fix the design side, I am going to fix the fab side.\u2019 I was hoping for his sake, for the country\u2019s sake, that he would be successful. I hope Intel recovers, but it looks pretty tough for them at this stage.\u201d\n\nGates spent his final years as Microsoft\u2019s CEO entangled in a high-profile antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department to break up the software maker. Although Microsoft remained intact, the company was declared an illegal monopoly, and the case caused a major distraction that paved the way for a then-cuddly startup Google to build a search engine that became a household word and then diversify into other areas, including making the Android software.\n\nA quarter century later, Google\u2019s search franchise has been branded an illegal monopoly by another federal judge in another Justice Department case that unfolded during the rise of artificial intelligence \u2014 a field where Microsoft has been making significant inroads as part of the partnership. The Justice Department has now proposed imposing various restrictions designed to undercut Google\u2019s power and also is seeking a court order to force the company to sell its Chrome web browser.\n\n\u201cThe success of Google is an amazing thing; they led the way on search,\u201d Gates said. \u201cThe area that Google did well in that would not have happened had I not been distracted is Android, where it was a natural thing for me. I was trying, although what I didn\u2019t do well enough is provide the operating system for the phone. That was ours for the taking.\u201d",

It didn't appreciate the monumental impact AI would have on the tech landscape.\n\nThe optimistic assessment is that Intel is a company in transition. The pessimistic view is that Intel is a company in trouble.\n\nIntel Corp. (ticker: INTC) has been the clear market share leader in central processing units, or CPUs, for PCs for more than 30 years. Most analysts believe the iconic chip maker will likely remain dominant in that important industry for years to come. The PC market, however, isn't what it used to be.\n\n\n\nToday, PCs face formidable and pervasive competition from Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) Mac laptops, which run on the macOS platform and mobile devices like tablets and smartphones, which predominantly run on iOS. The global PC market is projected to grow by about 3% between 2025 and 2028.\n\nThat's a far cry from the double-digit annual growth rate projections we were seeing before the COVID-19 pandemic. The technology industry appears to be moving beyond the operating systems and the processors that made Intel what it was. Innovative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing demand new, more advanced processors than those that Intel currently produces. There is concern from industry watchers, investors and almost all of Wall Street that Intel is being left behind.\n\nThe company's stock has performed dismally over the past five years. The stock is down about 54.2% for the 12 months ending Feb. 6, while the broad market as measured by the S&P 500 Index was up around 22% over that same time. Year to date, INTC has fallen roughly 3.3%, while the S&P has climbed by a little under 3%.\n\nExisting shareholders who want to know whether to sell or hold the stock and potential investors who are wondering if INTC has become a good value are all asking the same question: Will INTC recover and, if so, will the recovery happen in 2025?\n\n\n\nThe Challenges Facing Intel\n\nUnfortunately, the challenges facing Intel are many, and they are daunting.\n\nIn its traditional market \u2013 CPUs for PCs \u2013 Intel is losing market share to competitors: specifically, to Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD). As mentioned above, Intel is still the global market leader in its field, but the encroaching competition coupled with the slowdown in PC growth does not bode well for the future. Intel's PC chips and CPUs are widely considered best-in-class by the tech industry, but even where it has a superior product, it is lagging in manufacturing technology. Chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM) run far more modern and efficient factories. This hurts Intel's ability to produce advanced chips on a cost-effective basis.\n\nSponsored Brokers 1 Interactive Brokers Account Minimum $0 Fee $0 Low commission rates start at $0 for U.S. listed stocks & ETFs*.

Open An Account View Disclosure\n\nOn top of those pressing problems, Intel's foundry business \u2013 the segment that manufactures microchips for other companies \u2013 is floundering. In simple terms, Intel has failed to execute on its ambitious plans to expand its foundry operations. The foundry business is losing significant money and probably won't contribute positively to earnings until 2030.\n\nAll this is occurring while Intel's gross margins are falling. The company is under significant pressure as it lowers prices in an effort to maintain market share, while still dealing with pervasive input cost inflation. As a result, Intel has been outsourcing production to its manufacturing competitor, Taiwan Semiconductor, which carries the risk of exacerbating its problems.\n\nIntel does have some promising products in its pipeline. The company and the tech industry have high hopes for the new Clearwater Forest server CPU. But Intel is hampered by delays and cost overruns. This just gives the competition more time to develop comparable products and capture market share.\n\nAll of the above, however, may be less important to Intel's future than what some believe is the company's biggest problem: Intel lacks a meaningful AI accelerator.\n\nPut plainly, Intel was late to the AI party. It didn't appreciate the monumental impact AI would have on the tech landscape. INTC failed to follow Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) lead and pivot toward broad-market consumer and business AI products the way firms like Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) did.\n\nThe company does have a credible AI eXtended Processing Unit, or XPU, called Falcon Shores. Falcon Shores might have appealed to financial firms, data centers and other companies that use high speed computing, but the company blundered when, out of intellectual property concerns, it designated the XPU for internal use only. More recently, Intel has been focusing on promising AI endeavors like its Intel Gaudi Series acceleration chip and the Intel Core Ultra processor. It's also announced plans for a commercial version of its Falcon Shores chip \u2013 called Jaguar Shores \u2013 that it intends to market to AI-specific server farms. However, the fear on Wall Street is that Intel's efforts are too little too late.\n\nThe optimistic assessment is that Intel is a company in transition. The pessimistic view is that Intel is a company in trouble.\n\n\n\nWhat Is Wall Street's Opinion of Intel?\n\nIntel is an $83 billion company that, despite its underperformance, is still prominent in the tech industry. The company is followed by about 45 Wall Street analysts, and most of them have a neutral-to-negative opinion of INTC.\n\nCFRA Equity Analyst Angelo Zino, for example, has a \"hold\" rating on the stock, assigning it three out of five stars. Zino cites strong competitive pressures and an unimpressive start to the company's foundry operations. He believes these factors will continue to be a drag on earnings and, ultimately, its equity valuation. Zino's advice to investors: Hold the stock if you own it, but otherwise stay on the sidelines.\n\nMorningstar's Brian Colello states flatly, \"Intel's best days are likely behind it.\" Colello recently rated the stock three out of five stars. He believes that while Intel will eventually make headway into the AI chip business, the company's competition will be in a stronger position than even Intel was at the peak of its market prowess. Morningstar has assigned a \"no moat\" designation to the stock, meaning it believes the company has no significant competitive advantage right now.\n\nBofA Securities carries an \"underperform\" rating on Intel. In a report dated Jan. 31, BofA analyst Vivek Arya maintained that rating based on the fact that the company missed revenue estimates by $600 million versus its fiscal Q1 estimates. Arya had a $21 price objective but he lowered that number to $19. Given that the stock closed at $19.38 on Feb. 6, it's fair to say he doesn't expect much from the company in the near term.\n\nWill Intel Recover in 2025?\n\nNo one can predict the future. It's possible that investors will look back at February 2025 as an incredible buying opportunity for Intel stock. The company has realized its mistakes with regard to AI, and is working hard to maintain and build market share. There is reason to hope for better financial performance and better stock performance in the future.\n\nWe don't know how long Intel's turnaround will take, but we do know that, for the most part, Wall Street is offering investors no encouragement for 2025. While there are a few outliers recommending the stock, most credible research firms consider Intel dead money.",

Scores Just 2279 Points In Single and 11690 In Multi-Core Tests\n\nIf you were waiting for an 'actual' successor to the Core i9 14900K, the Core i9 15900K is here. There is no need to keep your hopes up for now, as it appears that the Core i9 15900K might be an early engineering sample, which seems to be misidentified in Geekbench.\n\nIt's likely a Core i9 14900K, which would have existed in the pre-production versions. As Intel tests its chips multiple times before launch, sometimes it's possible that some of the chips are designated different model numbers. However, it's also possible for the benchmarking database to mislabel such early samples.\n\nWe can see that the 15900K shares most of the specs with the 14900K. This includes 24 cores and 32 threads, and also the L2 and L3 cache of 8 MB and 36 MB, respectively. The socket is also the same, i.e., LGA 1700; therefore, it's likely a mislabeled 14900K, which the identifier indicates as well. Both Raptor Lake and Raptor Lake Refresh chips have the GenuineIntel Family 6 Model 183 Stepping 1 identifier, and we all know that the actual 15th-gen Intel processors, i.e., Arrow Lake chips, have the GenuineIntel Family 6 Model 198 Stepping 2 identifier.\n\nNonetheless, it's interesting to see the 15900 K's benchmarks, which reveal quite underwhelming performance in Geekbench. The single and multi-core scores (2279 and 11690 points, respectively) are significantly lower than those of the 14900K, and we can see that the mentioned frequencies are also much lower. The base clock is just 800 MHz, and the boost is 4.8 GHz. The 14900K brings a P-Core boost of 5.8 GHz and scores nearly 3,000 points in single and 20,000 points in multi-core tests in Geekbench 6.\n\nThe processor was tested on a B760 motherboard from a Chinese company called JGINYUE. This is the JGINYUE B760I Snow Dreammotherboard, boasting the ITX form factor and LGA 1700 socket. That's all you have to know about this benchmark. So, do not have high hopes of seeing another Intel processor series right now, as Intel isn't going to launch the so-called '15000' family, which, in fact, is the Core Ultra Series 2.\n\nNews Source: BenchLeaks",

            "content": "Intel's next-generation desktop CPU family, codenamed Nova Lake, is officially slated for a 2026 launch. Renowned leaker Jaykihn has weighed in at X, alleging Nova Lake could scale up to 52 cores.\n\nBefore you get excited, be aware that these are preliminary silicon configurations that could be canceled later. As a reminder, we saw similar rumors of a 40-core (8P + 32E) Arrow Lake chip, which likely did exist but never saw the light of day. Nonetheless, the leaker alleges Nova Lake will employ the Coyote Cove and Arctic Wolf architectures for its P-cores and E-cores, respectively.\n\n\ufeffShipping manifests from NBD suggest that Nova Lake test chips are currently in the hands of developers, which is expected since these CPUs are set to launch next year. Intel's co-CEO, Michelle Holthaus, asserted that some parts of Nova Lake will be built at external foundries (TSMC, Samsung), though most will remain in-house.\n\nJaykihn has listed three Nova Lake configurations that Intel is reportedly considering at the moment: 52 cores (16P + 32E + 4LPE), 28 cores (8P + 16E + 4LPE), and 16 cores (4P + 8E + 4LPE). The initial claim portrays the 52-core SKU as a dual 8P+16E design with four LPE cores (likely on the SoC Tile).\n\nDon\u2019t forget the LPe.Preliminary silicon configs are:52 (16+32+4)28 (8+16+4)16 (4+8+4)February 7, 2025\n\nIntel could adopt a dual-CCX-like design with a dedicated L3 cache for each 8P+16E pair, though a large, unified pool of L3 cache is also possible. The leaker suggests that the 52-core die is potentially designated for both desktops and laptops as an HX-grade SKU, but the claim isn't strongly asserted since all of this data is preliminary.\n\nThe tipster claims that Nova Lake will adopt Coyote Cove P-cores and Arctic Wolf E-cores for its architecture. It is speculated that Coyote Cove is the second successor to Lion Cove (Arrow Lake/Lunar Lake), following Cougar Cove (Panther Lake). On the E-core side, Skymont is rumored to be superseded by Darkmont, followed by Arctic Wolf.\n\nAdding to the mix, Jaykihn mentions a Nova Lake SKU with a 144MB L3 cache-equipped compute tile, suggesting its existence but not offering further details. Such exotic designs rarely see the light of day, so we highly recommend you take this leak with a grain of salt. Despite Nova Lake purportedly sticking with an off-die memory controller, rumors exist that Intel may have optimizations in place to minimize the latency penalty.",

(Intel 18A is the last node in former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger\u2019s comeback plan to surpass Asian foundry rivals TSMC and Samsung.)\n\nHolthaus said all this work provides a \u201cstrong foundation on which to build,\u201d noting that most of the world\u2019s data center workloads \u201cstill run on Intel silicon\u201d along with the company\u2019s \u201cstrong ecosystem, especially within enterprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to leverage these strengths as we work to stabilize our market share in 2025,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s an important fight for Intel. In November, CPU-tracking firm Mercury Research reported that AMD\u2019s share in the x86 server CPU segment reached 24.2 percent against Intel, which means that the rival is two points from reaching the record it hit in 2006. This, along with AMD\u2019s early success in the AI accelerator chip market, allowed the competitor to make nearly as much data center revenue as Intel did last year.\n\nIntel is also facing a threat in the form of Arm, whose instruction set architecture that has dominated smartphone chips is now the basis for custom server chips designed by Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud for their own infrastructure. In fact, AWS said in December that more than half of the new CPU capacity it brought online over the last two years was based on its Arm-based Graviton chips.\n\nHow Intel Plans To Fight Back In The Data Center\n\nTwo major ways Holthaus said Intel plans to win back server CPU share is \u201cby re-engaging the x86 ecosystem\u201d with the recently formed x86 ecosystem advisory group\u2014which has the backing of Microsoft, Dell Technologies, Google, AMD and other major tech vendors\u2014and by building semi-custom and custom solutions, like it is doing for AWS.\n\nHolthaus also noted that Intel \u201chas a leading position as the host CPU for AI servers, and we see a significant opportunity for CPU-based inference on prem and at the edge as AI-infused applications proliferate.\u201d\n\nAnother element that will help Intel compete is competitive pricing. In response to a question from a Wall Street analyst on whether competitive pricing will weigh down product margins throughout the year, Holthaus said Intel needs to win every deal it can. (Intel reportedly cut the prices of its Granite Rapids CPUs by as much as 30 percent last month.)\n\n\u201cWe have to stem the tide of share loss in data center, and so we will be fighting for every socket in that business. And the way I look at it is we need to be aggressive, we need to win share, and we need to show our customers that they can win with us,\u201d Holthaus said.\n\nIntel Global Channel Chief Dave Guzzi told CRN in an exclusive interview in January that while the company has cut its direct partner coverage by an unspecified amount, it has increased funding for partner incentive and investment programs, which includes money used for winning customer deals when Intel is faced with a competitive bid.\n\nIntel\u2019s Challenges: Arm, AMD And A Delay\n\nWhile Holthaus touted Intel\u2019s Xeon 6 P-core Granite Rapid CPUs as a positive step in becoming more competitive again, she suggested the other side of the Xeon 6 lineup featuring E-cores, known as Sierra Forest, isn\u2019t getting the traction it had hoped for.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that\u2019s more of a niche market, and we haven\u2019t seen volume materialize there as fast as we expected,\u201d she said.\n\nWhereas the Xeon 6 processors with P-cores continued Intel\u2019s legacy of delivering high-performance CPU cores in servers, the E-core chips are optimized for efficiency, allowing the company to deliver a higher number of cores with lower energy consumption.\n\nWith Intel pushing the E-core processors for cloud-native and telecom workloads, the chips have been viewed as Intel\u2019s response to the high-density, energy-efficient custom Arm-based processors that are allowing Intel\u2019s largest cloud customers\u2014AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud\u2014to lower their reliance on the semiconductor giant.\n\nIntel has also been faced with Ampere Computing, a chip design startup founded by former Intel executive Renee James that provides its own Arm-based processors with high core counts and low energy consumption for cloud-native workloads.\n\nBut while Ampere originally planned to go public through an initial public offering, Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Japanese investment giant SoftBank is in advanced talks to acquire the company, whose primary backer has been Oracle.\n\nOn the other hand, Qualcomm, which has begun selling custom Arm-based chips for PCs, has signaled that it plans to enter the server market with the recent hiring of Intel Xeon chief architect Sailesh Kottapalli, among other developments.\n\nThen there\u2019s AMD, which beat Intel in releasing energy-efficient x86 server CPUs with high core counts for cloud-native workloads in 2023. The chip designer then released a follow-up to its cloud-native server chips last year.\n\nDuring AMD\u2019s earnings call on Tuesday, the company\u2019s CFO, Jean Hu, didn\u2019t seem fazed that Intel planned to fight hard this year, saying that the chip designer \u201calways\u201d assumes that the server CPU market is \u201cvery competitive.\u201d She added that AMD has the \u201cbest lineup\u201d and the \u201cbest\u201d total cost of ownership with its fourth- and fifth-gen EPYC CPUs.\n\n\u201cSo overall, we are actually quite confident about [continuing] to drive the server CPU business,\u201d which is growing in unit sales, average selling prices and market share, she said.\n\nIn the same call, AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su said the company\u2019s server business \u201chas been performing extremely well\u201d between cloud and enterprise customers.\n\nAccording to Su, the company has seen \u201csome strong traction\u201d in the enterprise thanks to go-to-market investments it made last year\u2014which the leader of AMD\u2019s server CPU business detailed in a CRN interview a few months ago.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise sales cycle is often a six- to nine-month sales cycle, but as we\u2019ve invested more resources in it throughout 2024, we\u2019ve seen that convert into a significant number of new [proofs of concept] that are now converting into volume deployments,\u201d she said.\n\nThe other challenge Intel is facing is an internal one.\n\nOn the company\u2019s earnings call, Holthaus acknowledged that Intel\u2019s plan to release its next-gen Xeon E-core product, Clearwater Forest, in the first half of 2026 amounts to a delay from the original 2025 timeframe the chipmaker had given.\n\nClearwater Forest has been seen as a strategically important product in large part because of how it will be the first server CPU to use the Intel 18A node, which the company has repeatedly said will allow it to surpass the advanced chip-making capabilities of TSMC and Samsung. Several months before Gelsinger abruptly left the company as CEO, he said the product would allow Intel to \u201caccelerate share gains.\u201d\n\nDespite the delay, Holthaus said she still has high hopes for Clearwater Forest.\n\n\u201cIt does have some complicated packaging expectations that moved it to 2026, but we expect that to be a good product and continue to close the gap as well. But this is going to be a journey. It\u2019s not a destination,\u201d she said.",

In June 2024, it was reported that the research institution had partnered with IBM to develop a 10,000-qubit quantum computer slated to go online in 2029.\n\nUnder the terms of that MoU, the two companies reportedly agreed to jointly develop semiconductors and superconducting integrated circuits necessary to build next-generation quantum computers.\n\nIn August 2024, Intel\u2019s Ireland-based R&D division was named as one of 36 partners working to establish a European supply chain for cryogenic quantum technologies, including cryogenic photonics, microelectronics, and cryo-microsystems. The project, dubbed ARCTIC (Advanced Research on Cryogenic Technologies for Innovative Computing), is the first resulting from the European Union\u2019s Chips Joint Undertaking (CJU) scheme.\n\nA year prior, in June 2023, Intel released Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit chip for quantum research that integrates with the company\u2019s Quantum Software Development Kit (QSDK) and can be shared with researchers.\n\nAt the time of its launch, Intel promised to release a next-generation quantum chip in 2024. While that chip is still yet to arrive, in May 2024, the chipmaker published a research paper in the science journal Nature, claiming it had set a new industry standard for advancements in the uniformity, fidelity, and measurement statistics of spin qubits.\n\nIntel said this breakthrough would pave the way for scaling up production of more complex quantum computers capable of operating on a single chip.",

            "content": "The Intel Xeon E series is something that we have been reviewing for over 10 generations at STH. A fun fact, I used to buy the Intel Xeon E3-1200 series at retail before the chips were \u201claunched\u201d over a decade ago when STH was much smaller. Still, in 2025, Intel has a really neat challenge on its hands compared to AMD in the lower-end single-socket market.\n\nThe Intel Xeon E Challenge in 2025\n\nWe are at a strange crossroads for the Intel Xeon E series. The Intel Xeon E-2400 series launched about 14 months ago. The \u201cRaptor Lake\u201d parts are aligned to the 14th Gen Intel Core processors. Since then, Intel has its new 100 and 200 series processors, yet Xeon E is still stuck in 2023. It only scales to 8 cores and 16 threads, albeit with maximum clocks above 5GHz.\n\nHigh-speed cores are great for applications like databases and even EDA applicatons. I still remember seeing in 2016 the big racks of Intel Xeon E parts in an old Intel Santa Clara fab converted to a data center for EDA. These were in dense QCT systems that were very neat.\n\nLet us put this into some perspective. The Intel Xeon E3-1230 launched in 2011 was a four core part and one of my favorite chips. At that time, the top-end Intel Xeon E5-2600 parts had a maximum of eight cores. Since then, the dual socket CPUs have gone to at least 128 cores (excluding the cloud-native segment.) While we have seen roughly 16x core count growth in the mainstream server segment, we have only seen 2x growth in the entry Xeon segment. Of course, both series have higher clock speeds, newer architectures, and newer faster memory. Still, the Xeon E-series has roughly a similar PCIe footprint while the mainstream servers have increased significantly.\n\nPerhaps the obvious answer is that Intel could take its P-core/ E-core designs to the Xeon E series. One of the big challenges to that is introducing heterogeneous cores on the same chip. Software like VMware ESXi does not play as well with that type of architecture. While this can be fixed, and seems trivial at first, when SLAs are involved in enterprise environments, having heterogeneous cores adds another layer of scheduling challenges.\n\nIntel\u2019s main path to scaling, using heterogeneous cores, might not have been necessary five years ago, but it is a different world today. The AMD EPYC 4004 series launched in 2024 and that was the point when the entry server market was almost all Intel\u2019s. Now there is a competitive part in the market.\n\nFinal Words\n\nPart of this came about from the fact we are now working on our HPE ProLiant Microserver Gen11 review. This is an update to the HPE ProLiant MicroServer Gen10 Plus (and V2) that we looked at a few years ago and it was released just last year. I cannot help but wanting something a bit more from the CPU on the one hand. On the other hand, in this type of machine, if you just need storage and to run a few applications, the Xeon E-2400 series is still capable. This might have been a good segment for a Xeon D or even an Atom part years ago, but those have moved upmarket in terms of pricing.\n\nIt is a different market now than it was now that AMD has entered. This is not a segment where the dollars are huge from a market share perspective, but it is a segment where units shift. Maybe this is a long way of saying: Intel needs a new Xeon E. It feels like it is about time.",

            "content": "It\u2019s worth noting that INTC incurred a 6.63% loss last week as investors digested the muted outlook disclosed during the Q4 earnings report. Generally, negative weeks have a median loss of 3.09%, so this volatility is highly unusual. Notably, in the first week following a weekly loss between 5% and 10%, INTC\u2019s long odds rises to 53.13%.\n\nTo be fair, INTC stock is historically risky because it features a downward bias. Using data from the trailing five years, a position entered at the beginning of the week only has a 50.94% chance of rising by the end. Extend this framework to four weeks; the long odds will slip to 49.62%. Effectively, INTC is a coin toss.\n\nAs the passage of time reduces the premium value of options as they near expiration, traders of these derivative instruments usually think in short-term cycles. Therefore, many traders focus on pricing behaviors rather than large-scale fundamentals.\n\nUnlike investing in the security itself, traders seeking robust returns over a short period may consider options trading. However, prospective speculators must be aware that options are considered \u201cwasting assets\u201d \u2014 eventually, all options expire worthless. Therefore, while cheap, far-out-the-money options are tempting, they stand a high risk of not being salvageable at the time of expiration.\n\nWithout options, it\u2019s difficult to extract value from a beleaguered stock that\u2019s trending lower and failing to acquire positive sentiment despite posting solid performance metrics. Technically speaking, Intel\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report eclipsed expectations. While the company\u2019s revenue slipped by 7.4% year-over-year to $14.26 billion, this tally beat the consensus view by $430 million. However, the market consensus on INTC is currently strained, to say the leas t.\n\nHowever, there is another way of extracting a lucrative trading opportunity from INTC stock. If harnessing the utility of options, short-medium-term focused investors can profit from INTC.\n\nRegarding market opportunities in the semiconductor industry, Intel (INTC) no longer commands the social cachet it once did decades ago. Due to various missteps, controversies, and outright strategic blunders, Intel has now found itself on the back foot relative to its chip-making peers. As a result, very few investors are looking to INTC stock for upside prospects in the current market.\n\nStory Continues\n\nUnfortunately, by the end of the fourth week following this extreme fear event, the long odds diminish to 40%. Theoretically, the statistical trend warrants consideration of a bearish strategy, not a bullish one.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that in the recent past, when Intel delivered bad news \u2014 namely, the Q1 and Q2 earnings results of last year \u2014 the market digested the sourness immediately. Additional large-scale downside sessions were avoided until the following poor earnings results. The market may have already priced in the challenging outlook. Contextually speaking, INTC stock may have a decent chance of upside in the next few weeks.\n\nTwo Trades to Consider for Speculative Traders\n\nDynamically, given the condition of INTC stock suffering an extreme-fear event last week, there are better-than-coin-toss odds that shares will rise by this Friday (Feb. 7). Under the optimistic scenario, the median return clocks in at 2.51% while under the pessimistic scenario, the median loss sits at 4.17%.\n\nBased on this nuanced picture, traders can buy an in-the-money bull call spread for the Feb. 7 expiration date. A bull spread is a multi-leg options strategy involving buying a call option and simultaneously selling a call at a higher strike price (at the same expiration date). The idea is to use the credit received from the short call to partially offset the debit paid for the long call.\n\nTo be clear, the maximum reward is capped at the point represented by the short call strike price. However, the benefit is that the net bullish position is essentially discounted. Further, this discounting lowers the threshold to profitability (i.e., the breakeven price), improving the odds of success.\n\nSpecifically, conservative investors may consider the 18.50/19.50 bull spread for this Friday\u2019s expiration date. Based on market data, INTC could potentially hit $19.92 by expiration. On the risk side, there is a chance that INTC could fall to $18.62. However, purchasing the $18.50 long call component may allow the spread to have salvageable value in case the bullish thesis goes moderately awry.\n\nOf course, nothing is free in the market. For the protection above, the payout of the 18.50/19.50 bull spread is limited to 40.85% at the time of writing.\n\nSpeculators may consider the options chain expiring Feb. 28 for an even bigger reward. Statistically, bears have an advantage. However, because the bad news is likely to be priced in following Intel\u2019s Q4 earnings, there\u2019s a chance that INTC stock could override its usual statistical trajectory.\n\nAssuming the bulls win out, pricing trends suggest that INTC could rise by 6.41%. If the bears gain control, the equity could decline by 7.53%. All told INTC could move to $20.68 at the top or $17.97 at the bottom.\n\nWith these forecasts in mind, investors may consider the 18/20.50 bull spread for the options chain expiring Feb. 28. The long call provides salvageable value down to $18. Conversely, should INTC stock hit or exceed $20.50, the payout is a robust 90.84%. Speculators can get even more aggressive with a $21 short-call component, which quickly brings the payout above 100%.\n\nIs Intel a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, INTC stock carries an overwhelming Hold consensus rating based on one Buy, 25 Hold, and four Sell ratings. The average INTC price target is $22.02 per share, implying a 14% upside potential. While this doesn\u2019t sound terribly exciting, even moderately bullish traders can deploy options strategies to dramatically boost their profitability on INTC stock \u2014 especially in the short term.\n\nHapless INTC Stock Can Deliver Investor Returns\n\nIntel may not be the powerhouse it once was, but the market\u2019s muted expectations could open the door for opportunistic traders. While historical data suggests a mixed outlook, the company\u2019s tendency to stabilize after bad news hints at the potential for a near-term rebound. With options, traders can take advantage of this setup without relying on a protracted stock rally.\n\nBy structuring a well-thought-out bull call spread, investors can balance risk and reward while capitalizing on Intel\u2019s statistical tendencies. Whether opting for a conservative or aggressive approach, the right spread offers a path to solid returns while limiting downside exposure.\n\nDisclosure.",

Back then, Intel did not have any real competitors, so the number of cores did not increase quickly, which stimulated cloud service providers to buy more CPUs to meet the performance demands of their customers.\n\nThen, Intel processor sales increased in 2018 due to Meltdown and Spectre mitigations that reduced the performance of already installed CPUs and prompted CSPs to buy more servers with Intel CPUs in 2018. Competition from AMD became stronger in 2019, which is why sales of Intel CPUs for data centers slightly dropped that year.\n\nThen came COVID-19, and demand for cloud computing increased again in 2020 and 2021, further driving sales of Intel server CPUs.\n\nHowever, in 2022, demand for general-purpose servers slowed down while AMD unveiled its 4th Generation EPYC processors with up to 96 cores, far exceeding the number of cores in Intel\u2019s top-of-the-range Xeon CPUs. As a result, the blue team\u2019s unit shipments dropped in 2022 and then collapsed in 2023.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The authors included Gurpreet Sandhu, vice president of Intel\u2019s Platform Engineering Group; Reshma PP, director of system design for the Platform Engineering Group; and Roberta Zouain, sustainability product strategy and marketing manager.\n\nModular PC design would help extend product life and reduce e-scrap with upgradable systems and repairable or replaceable components, streamline manufacturing design and manage costs by reusing modules, and enable easier product SKU management and faster time to market, the authors wrote.\n\nTo help product engineers in the many varied sectors of technology devise an approach, the authors broke down modular design into three levels: factory, field and user. Which approach to use depends on the manufacturer\u2019s product positioning, market dynamics and costs, the blog authors wrote.\n\nAn example of factory modularity is a vehicle manufacturer providing several engine choices for one model of car. Modularity at this level enables flexibility and high levels of design reuse, and decreases costs and carbon footprint, and provides scalability, the authors wrote.\n\nIn contrast, field modularity allows for changes outside the factory setup, but may still require skilled labor or specialized tools. Vehicle tires and wheelsets are among current examples of field modularity, as many cars allow for different sizes and types. In this case, the dealer makes the changes to a vehicle that was manufactured with a standard setup.\n\nAnd finally, user modularity allows consumers to change product settings or components themselves \u2013 for example, wi-fi dongles, and upgradable memory and storage. These changes do not require dealer or manufacturer intervention, the authors wrote.\n\nMore stories about computers",

            "content": "Bill Gates was once the embodiment of the computer industry. Though the co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft retired over a decade ago to pursue full-time philanthropy, people still listen when he talks \u2014 and in a recent interview, he talked about Intel.\n\nIntel is having a rough time of late. The chipmaker\u2019s stock is practically in freefall. It\u2019s had high-profile failures for its most powerful CPUs, and rivals AMD and especially Nvidia are kicking its silicon butt in the AI arms race. In December, the company\u2019s CEO Pat Gelsinger stepped down after working for Intel on-and-off for decades. Yeah, it\u2019s bad.\n\nIntel is also one of Microsoft\u2019s most important partners, so it\u2019s no surprise that the company\u2019s woes came up in an interview with the Associated Press. \u201cI am stunned that Intel basically lost its way,\u201d Gates said.\n\n\u201cThey missed the AI chip revolution, and with their fabrication capabilities, they don\u2019t even use standards that people like Nvidia and Qualcomm find easy. I thought Pat Gelsinger was very brave to say, \u2018No, I am going to fix the design side, I am going to fix the fab side.\u2019 I was hoping for his sake, for the country\u2019s sake, that he would be successful. I hope Intel recovers, but it looks pretty tough for them at this stage.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bleak snippet in an otherwise positive interview, and it doesn\u2019t offer any realistic paths for Intel to make up ground. The company\u2019s most recent desktop and laptop chips have been met with more acclaim, and its new discrete GPUs are positioned to thrive in a budget space that has been woefully underserved for the last few years.\n\nBut you can\u2019t make hundreds of billions in profit selling cards to cash-strapped PC gamers\u2026 and with Nvidia still standing strong even after taking a hard knock from the DeepSeek news, that\u2019s definitely the measure of success for modern chipmakers.\n\nDon\u2019t take this for hyperbole. Intel isn\u2019t in danger of an imminent collapse. But after dominating the market for both consumers and enterprises for decades, the company simply isn\u2019t the powerhouse it was a few years ago. The most recent development is that the stock price got a welcome shot in the arm following rumors of an acquisition, something that would have been unthinkable not so long ago.",

            "content": "There aren't many deep value turnaround opportunities in the technology world these days. However, Intel (INTC 0.61%) is an interesting case.\n\nAfter falling behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.88%) in process technology, Intel embarked on an ambitious and expensive turnaround plan in 2021 to retake the technology lead and produce chips for other companies. The transition is supposed to bear fruit this year.\n\nBut things look ugly right now, as lower revenues and profits from less-good products combined with heavy investment in the turnaround has caused profitability to sink. Intel's stock fell 60% in 2024 and now trades below book value.\n\nWhile Intel actually beat expectations on last week's fourth quarter earnings call, it guided softly because of a potential pull-forward of sales before potential tariffs. Yet while the fourth-quarter profits only slightly \"beat,\" they were actually much better than advertised.\n\nIntel's fourth quarter looked strong, but...\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Intel generated revenue of $14.26 billion, well ahead of the $13.83 billion estimated by analysts. And while adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share of $0.13 came in ahead of estimates as well, that bottom line only beat by $0.01. Given the magnitude of the revenue beat, one might have thought more would flow to the bottom line.\n\nManagement also guided for a sequential decline in the first quarter, to $12.2 billion in revenue at the midpoint and adjusted earnings per share of breakeven. The first quarter usually sees a seasonal decline, but this one looked a bit worse because of the pull-forward of purchases ahead of tariffs.\n\nUnderwhelming Q4 margins seem to have been concentrated in Intel's data center (DCAI) segment. Even though that segment grew sequentially, margins actually fell into the single digits:\n\nA 6.9% operating margin would be strange and worrisome, not only because the segment's revenue grew, but also because Q4 saw the launch of Intel's new Xeon 6 server products, Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest, which first hit the market late in Q3. Given that these chips were coming out of Intel 3, Intel's most advanced fab in mass production today, one would have expected much better margins.\n\nOne-time charges affected the results\n\nFortunately, upon reading Intel's annual report, the situation is less dire -- at least regarding current server products.\n\nIn the report, Intel mentioned the company took a $922 million inventory reserve charge in 2024 for its Gaudi 3 accelerator line. These were the AI accelerators Intel hoped would challenge Nvidia (NVDA 4.09%) in data center AI applications. Earlier this year, former CEO Pat Gelsinger had let on that Intel would sell up to $500 million of these accelerators in the back half of this year. However, now it looks as though Intel has written off those products to zero.\n\nOn top of that, interim co-CEO Michelle Holthaus also said on the Q4 call that the upcoming Falcon Shores AI chip, planned for this year, would only be an \"internal test chip\" and not brought to market. Intel will essentially skip Falcon and move to Jaguar Shores, the next AI chip on the roadmap, faster.\n\nThe downside is that Intel's accelerators don't seem to be selling well and may have some architectural flaws. Hopefully, the Jaguar Shores product, likely to be released in 2026, will have fixed those flaws and become a competitive challenger.\n\nBut the bright side is that current CPUs are doing much better from a margin perspective. Of that $922 million charge, it appears $313 million was taken in the third quarter. That leaves a $609 million charge taken in the fourth quarter.\n\nIf one adds that $609 million back to the data center segment, then fourth quarter data center operating income would have increased from $233 million to $842 million. That would have increased Intel's data center CPU operating margins from the reported 6.9% to 24.9%.\n\nThat's actually quite a competitive margin. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 2.52%) data center operating margins were 29.3% in the third quarter 2024; however, AMD also groups its new MI300 AI GPUs, which probably have a higher margin, into that segment, and AMD has also produced CPUs on TSMC's leading node, whereas Intel is still in transition to a leading-edge process.\n\nAnother one-time charge hit results\n\nIn addition to the Gaudi write-off, Intel also took a $755 million accrual charge related to its Ireland Intel 3 fab. In mid-2024, private equity firm Apollo Global (APO 1.97%) invested $11 billion for a 49% stake in Intel's Ireland fab 34. However, Intel has scaled back the buildout, probably because of last summer's decision to move its Arrow Lake desktop CPU product to TSMC. Arrow Lake was supposed to be built on Intel's 20A process in Ireland, but Intel decided to accelerate development of its more advanced 18A node to move faster and save money. Given that the Ireland fab won't build as much product, Intel is giving some of that $11 billion back, it appears.\n\nCounteracting that charge in Q4, Intel did receive a $560 million benefit as well, because of a successful challenge of a 2009 European Commission legal ruling.\n\nCombining the $609 million Gaudi write-off and $755 million Apollo charge, then subtracting the $560 million EC payment, and the net effect of these one-time charges would be $804 million, or roughly $700 million after-tax. That equates to over $0.16 per share.\n\nSo absent these non-recurring charges, Intel's Q4 adjusted EPS would have been $0.29, more than double the $0.13 reported.\n\nIntel's big year\n\nAfter former CEO Pat Gelsinger retired in December, things remain uncertain for Intel, as it's still without a permanent CEO, and its data center accelerator business appears pushed out even further.\n\nHowever, other elements around current products seemed to be better, with strong PC sales and sequential improvement in data center, absent those charges.\n\n2025 will see the all-important introduction of Intel's 18A node, which is supposed to surpass TSMC in process technology. And even though Intel's interim co-CEOs seem to be forecasting conservatively in other respects, both had good things to say about 18A on the conference call with analysts.\n\nCo-CEO David Zinsner said, \"We're excited by the launch of Panther Lake this year and the internal ramp of Intel 18A in the second half that will support increased volumes and improved profitability in 2026. From the perspective of external customers, Intel 18A is a very competitive offering that gives each of them a reason to engage with us.\" Holthaus later added: \"What I can tell you is 18A is going well. They earn my business.\"\n\nSo, the bad news is that Intel's AI accelerator roadmap appears to be pushed out. But the good news is that profitability was a bit better than it appears, and the all-important 18A node is on track. If the positives continue outweighing the negatives, Intel will be a turnaround story worth watching in 2025.",

Whether you are tailgating at the game itself or joining friends for a watch party, most of your favorite gameday foods come from family farms right here in the U.S.! In fact, Americans will eat about 1.47 billion chicken wings along with other favorites. But it\u2019s a long way from the farm to your table for many of these foods, and each step in the supply chain eats away at the farmer\u2019s share of the food dollar. This Market Intel will break down a few football favorites foods and estimate how much of every dollar spent at the grocery store goes back to the farmer for each. Author\u2019s note: Data in this Market Intel is based on average retail prices reported by USDA and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) via the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank (FRED) where possible and calculated estimates for prices where data is absent. Actual retail prices will vary as they say. America\u2019s Favorite, Wings! Americans will consume about 1.47 billion chicken wings on Super Bowl Sunday. Years ago, chicken wings used to be discarded or simply boiled for soup stock because of their small size and limited meat. Today, they are covered in spices and sauce and have become a value-added favorite! According to the latest national chicken report from USDA-Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the national average price for whole chicken wings is $1.91 per pound. At this price, farmers will receive about $0.30 per pound of chicken wings. If American\u2019s consume 1.47 billion wings, that\u2019s $561.5 million worth of chicken wings by value, contributing approximately $89 million dollars to family farms!\n\nTortilla Chips According to BLS, the average price for a bag of chips was $6.32 in December 2024. It takes about 1.25 ounces of corn to make 1 ounce of corn tortilla chips. Using USDA\u2019s 2023/24 Market Year Average price for corn, $4.55 per bushel, the farmer\u2019s share of a bag of chips is about 1.5% or 10 cents per bag. Veggies \u2013 Carrots and Celery It\u2019s hard to enjoy wings without adding the classic sides: celery and carrots. Raw vegetables have a much more direct route from the farm to the table. According to USDA, the farm share of the consumer dollar for fresh vegetables is about 28%. Using this figure, the farmer\u2019s share for 1 pound of carrots and 1 bunch of celery is about 69 cents of the $2.46 retail value. Dairy Most recipes call for about 12 ounces of cheddar cheese for each pint of queso dip. The average price for 1 pound of cheddar cheese was $5.62 in December 2024. The farmer\u2019s share of the consumer dollar for processed dairy products is about 36%. This means the farmer\u2019s share for two,12-ounce blocks of cheddar cheese is about $3.03.",

            "content": "AMD on Tuesday announced its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024 and for the whole year. As expected, the company managed to post impressive results driven by its client and datacenter CPUs. Perhaps AMD's biggest achievement in the quarter is that the company managed to outsell Intel in the datacenter space for the first time in history. Yet, sales of AMD's datacenter GPUs somewhat disappointed market observers.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD)\n\nAMD's revenue in Q4 2024 totaled $7.658 billion, up 24% year-over-year. The company's gross margin hit 51%, whereas net income was $482 million. On the year basis, 2024 was AMD's best year ever as the company's revenue reached $25.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year. The company earned net income of $1.641 billion as its gross margin hit 49%. But while the company's annual results are impressive, there is something about Q4 results that AMD should be proud of.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD)\n\nDatacenter business was the company's primary source of earnings, with net revenue reaching record $3.86 billion in Q4, marking a 69% year-over-year (YoY) increase and a 9% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) rise. Operating income also saw substantial improvement, surging 74% YoY to $1.16 billion. By contrast, Intel's datacenter and AI business unit posted $3.4 billion revenue, while its operating income reached $200 million. But while the quarter marked a milestone for AMD, market analysts expected AMD to sell more of its Instinct MI300-series GPUs for AI and HPC.\n\nAMD's client business unit, which includes CPUs for desktops and laptops, showed exceptional growth in Q4. Net revenue climbed 58% YoY to $2.31 billion and 23% QoQ. However, the standout figure was the 711% year-over-year surge in operating income, reaching $446 million.\n\nUnfortunately for AMD, its gaming business struggled in the fourth quarter, with net revenue declining to $563 million, or 59% less compared to the same timeframe in the previous year. The operating income of the unit plunged 78% year-over-year to just $50 million. The major decline being the result of lower sales of Radeon discrete GPUs as well as system-on-chips for Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation game consoles.\n\nAMD's embedded segment saw a moderate decline in the fourth quarter with net revenue falling to $923 million, or by 13% compared to Q4 2023, while operating income dropped 21% to $362 million. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, revenue remained flat, but operating income declined 3%.",

Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nWith AMD's stock down by 9% in premarket trading after yesterday's lackluster fourth-quarter earnings report, which saw the firm miss analyst estimates for data center revenue and guide a tepid first quarter, the firm nevertheless managed to earn more revenue from the business division than Intel did during the same time period. AMD's fourth quarter saw it rake $3.86 billion through selling CPUs and GPUs to the data center industry. On the other hand, while AMD's data center revenue marked a 69% annual growth, Intel's fourth-quarter data center revenue sat at $3.4 billion and was down by 3% annually.\n\nAMD Crosses Intel In Data Center Revenue In Second Consecutive Quarter\n\nAMD's fourth quarter wasn't the first time the firm managed to beat Intel in the data center business. Unlike Intel, AMD is capable of designing and selling GPUs and CPUs in volume to data center customers. The high-end GPUs part of AMD's data center business are its Instinct accelerators, which are designed to cater to AI workloads. On the flip side, Intel's data center revenue comes primarily through its Xeon processors, accompanied by its Gaudi AI accelerators.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, AMD's balanced portfolio of EPYC CPUs and Instinct accelerators enabled the firm to earn $3.86 billion through its data center business. This marked a strong 69% annual growth and kept pace with AMD's rapid growth in a business that had earned $2.28 billion in revenue during Q4 2023.\n\n2 of 9\n\nIn comparison with AMD's $3.86 billion data center revenue, Intel earned $3.4 billion via the Data Center and AI (DCAI) business during the fourth quarter. This marked a 3% annual drop and a small $100 million sequential growth. During Q3, Intel had earned $3.3 billion via DCAI which meant that the business' revenue grew by 9% annually.\n\nIn the age of AI, AMD has aggressively pushed towards mergers and acquisitions to grow its data center business. One such deal is its $3.7 billion cash offer to buy server manufacturer ZT Systems. AMD announced the deal in August last year, and outlined that the benefits of the transaction would be visible on the income statement by the end of this year.\n\nOn the day of its earnings, i.e. yesterday, AMD notified the European Comission of the deal. Now, as per Dow Jones, the Commission has started its preliminary scrutiny to determine whether to launch a detailed investigation or clear the deal. The Commission expects to reach a decision on the matter by March 12th.",

            "content": "Regarding market opportunities in the semiconductor industry, Intel (INTC) no longer commands the social cachet it once did decades ago. Due to various missteps, controversies, and outright strategic blunders, Intel has now found itself on the back foot relative to its chip-making peers. As a result, very few investors are looking to INTC stock for upside prospects in the current market.\n\nHowever, there is another way of extracting a lucrative trading opportunity from INTC stock. If harnessing the utility of options, short-medium-term focused investors can profit from INTC.\n\nWithout options, it\u2019s difficult to extract value from a beleaguered stock that\u2019s trending lower and failing to acquire positive sentiment despite posting solid performance metrics. Technically speaking, Intel\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report eclipsed expectations. While the company\u2019s revenue slipped by 7.4% year-over-year to $14.26 billion, this tally beat the consensus view by $430 million. However, the market consensus on INTC is currently strained, to say the least.\n\nINTC\u2019s Statistical Framework Sets Up Options Trade\n\nUnlike investing in the security itself, traders seeking robust returns over a short period may consider options trading. However, prospective speculators must be aware that options are considered \u201cwasting assets\u201d \u2014 eventually, all options expire worthless. Therefore, while cheap, far-out-the-money options are tempting, they stand a high risk of not being salvageable at the time of expiration.\n\nAs the passage of time reduces the premium value of options as they near expiration, traders of these derivative instruments usually think in short-term cycles. Therefore, many traders focus on pricing behaviors rather than large-scale fundamentals.\n\nTo be fair, INTC stock is historically risky because it features a downward bias. Using data from the trailing five years, a position entered at the beginning of the week only has a 50.94% chance of rising by the end. Extend this framework to four weeks; the long odds will slip to 49.62%. Effectively, INTC is a coin toss.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that INTC incurred a 6.63% loss last week as investors digested the muted outlook disclosed during the Q4 earnings report. Generally, negative weeks have a median loss of 3.09%, so this volatility is highly unusual. Notably, in the first week following a weekly loss between 5% and 10%, INTC\u2019s long odds rises to 53.13%.\n\nUnfortunately, by the end of the fourth week following this extreme fear event, the long odds diminish to 40%. Theoretically, the statistical trend warrants consideration of a bearish strategy, not a bullish one.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that in the recent past, when Intel delivered bad news \u2014 namely, the Q1 and Q2 earnings results of last year \u2014 the market digested the sourness immediately. Additional large-scale downside sessions were avoided until the following poor earnings results. The market may have already priced in the challenging outlook. Contextually speaking, INTC stock may have a decent chance of upside in the next few weeks.\n\nTwo Trades to Consider for Speculative Traders\n\nDynamically, given the condition of INTC stock suffering an extreme-fear event last week, there are better-than-coin-toss odds that shares will rise by this Friday (Feb. 7). Under the optimistic scenario, the median return clocks in at 2.51% while under the pessimistic scenario, the median loss sits at 4.17%.\n\nBased on this nuanced picture, traders can buy an in-the-money bull call spread for the Feb. 7 expiration date. A bull spread is a multi-leg options strategy involving buying a call option and simultaneously selling a call at a higher strike price (at the same expiration date). The idea is to use the credit received from the short call to partially offset the debit paid for the long call.\n\nTo be clear, the maximum reward is capped at the point represented by the short call strike price. However, the benefit is that the net bullish position is essentially discounted. Further, this discounting lowers the threshold to profitability (i.e., the breakeven price), improving the odds of success.\n\nSpecifically, conservative investors may consider the 18.50/19.50 bull spread for this Friday\u2019s expiration date. Based on market data, INTC could potentially hit $19.92 by expiration. On the risk side, there is a chance that INTC could fall to $18.62. However, purchasing the $18.50 long call component may allow the spread to have salvageable value in case the bullish thesis goes moderately awry.\n\nOf course, nothing is free in the market. For the protection above, the payout of the 18.50/19.50 bull spread is limited to 40.85% at the time of writing.\n\nSpeculators may consider the options chain expiring Feb. 28 for an even bigger reward. Statistically, bears have an advantage. However, because the bad news is likely to be priced in following Intel\u2019s Q4 earnings, there\u2019s a chance that INTC stock could override its usual statistical trajectory.\n\nAssuming the bulls win out, pricing trends suggest that INTC could rise by 6.41%. If the bears gain control, the equity could decline by 7.53%. All told INTC could move to $20.68 at the top or $17.97 at the bottom.\n\nWith these forecasts in mind, investors may consider the 18/20.50 bull spread for the options chain expiring Feb. 28. The long call provides salvageable value down to $18. Conversely, should INTC stock hit or exceed $20.50, the payout is a robust 90.84%. Speculators can get even more aggressive with a $21 short-call component, which quickly brings the payout above 100%.\n\nIs Intel a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, INTC stock carries an overwhelming Hold consensus rating based on one Buy, 25 Hold, and four Sell ratings. The average INTC price target is $22.02 per share, implying a 14% upside potential. While this doesn\u2019t sound terribly exciting, even moderately bullish traders can deploy options strategies to dramatically boost their profitability on INTC stock \u2014 especially in the short term.\n\nHapless INTC Stock Can Deliver Investor Returns\n\nIntel may not be the powerhouse it once was, but the market\u2019s muted expectations could open the door for opportunistic traders. While historical data suggests a mixed outlook, the company\u2019s tendency to stabilize after bad news hints at the potential for a near-term rebound. With options, traders can take advantage of this setup without relying on a protracted stock rally.\n\nBy structuring a well-thought-out bull call spread, investors can balance risk and reward while capitalizing on Intel\u2019s statistical tendencies. Whether opting for a conservative or aggressive approach, the right spread offers a path to solid returns while limiting downside exposure.\n\nDisclosure.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "The past year has been a terrible one for Intel (INTC 0.59%) investors as share prices of the once-mighty semiconductor giant have fallen 55%, driven by the company's inability to capitalize on hot technology trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) and market share losses to rivals.\n\nHowever, Chipzilla's fourth-quarter 2024 results (which were released on Jan. 30) did provide a glimmer of hope to investors, even if for a brief period. The stock rose initially after the results were released as it beat Wall Street's estimates, but it wasn't long before it retreated nearly 3% as more details emerged.\n\nLet's see why that was the case and check if Intel's latest results were good enough to warrant a buy.\n\nIntel may have exceeded expectations, but it isn't out of the woods yet\n\nIntel's fourth-quarter revenue of $14.3 billion was down 7% from the year-ago period. Analysts were projecting a bigger fall as they anticipated revenue of $13.8 billion for the quarter. However, investors should note that Intel's revenue beat was powered by the $1.1 billion grant it received in Q4 under the CHIPS Act. Management also added on the earnings conference call that it suspects a \"portion of Q4 revenue upside was due to customers' hedging against potential tariffs.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Intel's revenue outlook of $12.2 billion for the current quarter is below expectations of $12.87 billion. The midpoint of its revenue guidance points toward a 4% decline in its top line on a year-over-year basis. However, Intel's adjusted earnings per share would fall from $0.18 per share in the year-ago quarter to breakeven in the current quarter.\n\nIn simpler words, the contraction in Intel's revenue and earnings is here to stay. That makes buying Intel right now a risky move considering that nearly all of its business segments are struggling. For instance, the company's revenue from sales of central processing units (CPUs) used in laptops and desktops was down 9% year over year in the previous quarter. That's in stark comparison to Advanced Micro Devices, which has been taking share away from Intel and has been enjoying impressive growth in this market.\n\nMeanwhile, the 3% year-over-year decline in Intel's data center and AI revenue clearly indicates that it has missed the bus in this market as well. Both AMD and Nvidia have been reporting solid growth in sales of their server CPUs and data center graphics cards used for training and deploying AI models. Intel, however, is writing off the inventory of its Gaudi AI accelerators and scrapped its goal of achieving $500 million in revenue from sales of these chips.\n\nThe company says software issues have derailed its plans to tap the booming AI accelerator market. AMD and Nvidia, on the other hand, are pushing the envelope in AI accelerators with a new chip planned for launch every year. So, Intel's rivals could build a big enough technology gap that the former may not be able to bridge.\n\nAlso, Intel's earnings forecast for the current quarter is lower than the $0.08 per share that analysts were projecting. The company is expected to report a profit of $0.53 per share in 2025 as per analysts' expectations, but the way it has started the year suggests that it may not be able to get there.\n\nThe valuation suggests there are better AI chip plays out there\n\nTrading at 39 times forward earnings, Intel cannot be called cheap considering its shrinking bottom line. At a similar valuation, investors can get their hands on other semiconductor stocks such as Nvidia, AMD, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which have been growing at much faster rates and enjoy competitive advantages over Intel.\n\nMoreover, only three of the 46 analysts covering Intel stock suggest buying it right now. That's despite the fact that its 12-month median price target of $25 points toward a 29% jump from current levels. Intel may not be able to achieve that based on its performance and outlook in the latest quarter, which clearly indicates that the company is still a long distance from regaining its competitive edge.\n\nThat's why savvy investors would do well to take a closer look at other names in the semiconductor industry instead of Intel as they are likely to deliver much stronger gains.",

The WARN Act requires employers to give 60-days\u2019 noticebefore a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation.\n\nEmployers must notify employees and both state and local representatives. This helps workers prepare for job loss, find new jobs, or train for new opportunities. According to the report, the newest round of reductions are expected to take place by March 31.\n\nAs previously reported over the last 24 months, Intel\u2019s Folsom workforce has seen significant reductions in recent years. Once employing over 6,000 people in 2018, the site now reportedly has fewer than 4,000 workers. The upcoming layoffs are part of a series of job cuts that have hit the Folsom location over the past three years. The most recent round, on November 15, resulted in 272 job losses.\n\nLate last year, Intel announced its plans to sell the 150-acre Folsom campus in a sale-leaseback deal to free up capital tied to real estate. The campus, one of Intel\u2019s largest, includes seven buildings with a combined 1.5 million square feet of office, lab, and test space. Commercial real estate firm Colliers is managing the sale and leasing of the vacant space.\n\nThe layoffs align with Intel\u2019s broader restructuring efforts, as outlined in an earlier letter from former CEO Pat Gelsinger, which stated the company aimed to cut some 15,000 jobs as part of its cost-saving strategy. To facilitate the reductions, Intel then introduced voluntary separation and early retirement programs.\n\nLate last summer, the City of Folsom and Choose Folsom, which is the Folsom Chamber of Commerce, issued a joint statement citing their support for the local workforce that could be affected in the cuts as they take place. Intel is the largest employer in the City of Folsom.\n\n\u201cWe at the City of Folsom and Choose Folsom recognize the potential impact this news may have on our community. While the specific details concerning the number of layoffs affecting Folsom remain uncertain, we extend our deepest sympathies to all those impacted by this decision,\u201d read the statement shared with Folsom Times at the time.\n\n\u201cThe City of Folsom and Choose Folsom are committed to supporting our local workforce during this challenging time. We are confident in our community\u2019s resilience and ability to adapt to changes in the industry,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cAs we navigate through this period, we look toward the future with optimism. We believe in the strength and diversification of the tech industry in Folsom, and we are dedicated to fostering an environment that continues to attract and retain a diverse range of tech enterprises.\u201d\n\nIntel, founded in 1968 and headquartered in Santa Clara, is a global leader in semiconductor technology, particularly known for its computer processors. The company has faced increased competition from rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), AMD, and Nvidia, which have steadily chipped away at Intel\u2019s market share in various sectors. Intel\u2019s Folsom campus, covering 236 acres and housing over 5,000 employees, is a major hub for the company\u2019s office, research, development, and support activities.",

Kennedy Jr. is confirmed as the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cThings don\u2019t always go in a straight line,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIf you had said to me that at a time where we\u2019ve cut child\u2019s deaths in half since the turn of the century, and the main reason is vaccines, but their reputation would be more confused today than ever, I would have said, \u2018Are you kidding? These are miracles.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cFor somebody with a logical view like I try to have, it is confounding you have those conspiracy theories. I hope that dies down. I don\u2019t think we will have something bad happen. Because these infectious diseases are at very low levels in the U.S., you don\u2019t have this immediate, \u2018Oh my, God, we didn\u2019t take measles vaccines,\u2019 and sadly here are these people who died. In Africa, that happens very quickly because measles is everywhere and kids are malnourished. So it just takes a little bit longer that sadly people have to see deaths before they get reconnected to the miraculous value that vaccines provide.\u201d\n\nGates might have gone done a different career path if Intel hadn\u2019t made the technological breakthroughs that created a tiny chip capable of powering a personal computer during the early 1970s. That advance created the need for programs to use the computer, prompting Gates and Paul Allen to launch Micro-Soft, a name derived from microprocessor and software (the hyphen was later dropped).\n\nThat\u2019s why Gates has a soft spot for Intel, which missed the shift from PCs to smartphones 18 years ago, just as Microsoft did. But Microsoft has bounced back while Intel\u2019s troubles have deteriorated to the point that it\u2019s looking for a new CEO since the abrupt departure of Pat Gelsinger in December, raising worries about whether the company will survive. Although he is rooting for Intel, Gates has his doubts about a comeback.\n\n\u201cI am stunned that Intel basically lost its way,\u201d Gates said. \u201c(Intel co-founder) Gordon Moore always kept Intel at the state of the art. And now they are kind of behind in terms of chip design and they are kind of behind in chip fabrication. And both of those are very capital intensive. They missed the AI chip revolution, and with their fabrication capabilities, they don\u2019t even use standards that people like Nvidia and Qualcomm find easy. I thought Pat Gelsinger was very brave to say, \u2018No, I am going to fix the design side, I am going to fix the fab side.\u2019 I was hoping for his sake, for the country\u2019s sake that he would be successful. I hope Intel recovers, but it looks pretty tough for them at this stage.\u201d\n\nGates spent his final years as Microsoft\u2019s CEO entangled in a high-profile antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department to break up the software maker. Although Microsoft remained intact, the company was declared an illegal monopoly and the case caused a major distraction that paved the way for a then-cuddly startup Google to build a search engine that became a household word and then diversify into other areas, including making the Android software that powers virtually all of the world\u2019s smartphones besides Apple\u2019s iPhone.\n\nA quarter century later, Google\u2019s search franchise has been branded an illegal monopoly by another federal judge in another Justice Department case that unfolded during the rise of artificial intelligence \u2014 a field where Microsoft has been making significant inroads as part of the partnership. The Justice Department has now proposed imposing various restrictions designed to undercut Google\u2019s power and also is seeking a court order to force the company to sell its Chrome web browser. So Gates understands what Google has been going through like few others.\n\n\u201cThe success of Google is an amazing thing, they led the way on search,\u201d Gates said. \u201cThe area that Google did well in that would not have happened had I not been distracted is Android, where it was a natural thing for me. I was trying, although what I didn\u2019t do well enough is provide the operating system for the phone. That was ours for the taking.\n\n\u201cGoogle is the first company that comes along that is like us, that\u2019s trying to hire as many smart people as they can. And, even though search was important to them, they just decided to do YouTube and Office-type software and cloud-type infrastructure. They did a lot of things. Our other competitors up to that point were single-product companies. So that competition with Google has been very healthy. I don\u2019t envy anyone having antitrust problems but in America, if you are hyper-successful, it\u2019s almost like confirmation that, \u2018Wow, you must have done really well., and now they are wondering how to tame you. Microsoft learned a lot and, so far, by and large, we have stayed out of trouble since then.\u201d",

Intel contested the fine, leading to a series of legal proceedings. In 2022, the General Court of the European Union annulled the fine, citing insufficient analysis by the European Commission. The Commission\u2019s subsequent appeal was dismissed by the European Court of Justice in October 2024, effectively ending the long-standing case.\n\nRelated: Intel Receives Over $536 Million in Default Interest from EU Antitrust Regulators\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s decision, Intel sought \u20ac593 million in interest on the annulled fine. The European Commission initially resisted, but the EU Court of Justice upheld Intel\u2019s claim, resulting in the Commission making the payment to Intel on November 6, 2024.\n\nDespite this legal victory, Intel continues to face challenges. In 2023, the company was fined \u20ac376 million for payments made to HP, Acer, and Lenovo to hinder competing products. Additionally, Intel reported a net loss of $100 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, with annual losses totaling $18.8 billion, reflecting a 7% year-on-year decline in revenue.\n\nSource: Reuters",

If accurate, we could see double the performance and efficiency over Arrow Lake desktop processors.\n\nNova Lake Configuration RumorsNVL-SK: 2*8+16 NVL-HX: 1*8+16 NVL-S/NVL-H: 4+8 NVL-U: 4+0https://t.co/olvUda0A2pJanuary 31, 2025\n\nCompared to the Intel Arrow Lake-S CPUs, with the flagship Intel Core Ultra 9 285K equipped with eight P-cores and 16 E-cores, Nova Lake could significantly upgrade Intel's arsenal. It also stands to compete with the upcoming AMD Zen 6, which is set to offer 32 cores in total, as noted by Wccftech.\n\nAs a quick explainer, P-cores are designed for high-performance and demanding tasks, while E-cores work to optimize power efficiency and power background tasks. The more a CPU has, the better it is at delivering powerful performance and managing efficiency.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what Intel Arrow Lake currently offers:\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Arrow Lake Intel Core Ultra 200S chips Header Cell - Column 0 CPU cores Max GHz GPU Xe cores Intel Core Ultra 5 245KF ($294) 14 (6 performance, 8 efficiency) 5.2 GHz 0 Intel Core Ultra 5 245K ($309) 14 (6 performance, 8 efficiency) 5.2 GHz 4 Intel Core Ultra 7 265KF ($379) 20 (8 performance, 12 efficiency) 5.5 GHz 0 Intel Core Ultra 7 265K ($394) 20 (8 performance, 12 efficiency) 5.5 GHz 4 Intel Core Ultra 9 285K ($589) 24 (8 performance, 16 efficiency) 5.7 GHz 4\n\nWe also saw other Nova Lake CPU configurations, including those for the Nova Lake-HX, H and U processors. Nova Lake-HX is expected to offer eight P-cores and 16 E-cores. H (tipped for mobile devices) should offer four P-cores and eight E-cores. And the lower-end U variant will have just four P-cores.\n\nWhether these configurations are accurate is still up in the air, as the next-gen Intel Nova Lake CPUs aren't expected to arrive until next year. Still, it's exciting to see what the company may have in store, especially since Intel even apologized for its Arrow Lake desktop CPU performance issues (and fixes).\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

            "content": "Intel (INTC 0.46%) has largely failed to tap into soaring demand for artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators. The company's acquisition of AI chip start-up Habana Labs back in 2019, three years before the AI boom kicked off in earnest, certainly seemed like a prescient move. Habana's Gaudi family of AI accelerators, which were tailor-made for AI workloads compared to more general-purpose GPUs, had all the makings of a big winner.\n\nIntel is now on the third generation of its Gaudi AI chips, and progress has been excruciatingly slow. The company set a goal of selling $500 million worth of AI accelerators last year, a target that it ended up missing. Meanwhile, Nvidia is churning up tens of billions of dollars in AI chip revenue each quarter, and AMD has guided for about $5 billion in AI chip sales for 2024.\n\nOne big problem for Intel has been software. Gaudi is not a GPU, so the architecture is very different from the AI accelerators that currently dominate the market. Despite aggressive pricing from Intel, an immature software ecosystem has been holding Gaudi back. Intel has had some wins, including a deal with IBM to put Gaudi 3 chips in IBM's cloud data centers. Unfortunately for Intel, these wins just haven't been big enough to really move the needle.\n\nShaking up the roadmap\n\nIntel's AI accelerator roadmap has been a bit scattered for quite a while. Until last week, the plan was to launch Falcon Shores in late 2025. Falcon Shores is a more traditional GPU that was expected to incorporate some features from the Gaudi family of chips. The planned end of the Gaudi chip family and the switch to an entirely new architecture may have been factors that kept potential Gaudi customers away.\n\nDuring its fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, Intel disclosed that Falcon Shores was being scrapped as a commercial product. The new plan is to use Falcon Shores as an internal test chip as the company focuses on rack-level AI solutions built around Jaguar Shores, which was supposed to be Falcon Shores' successor.\n\nThis effectively marks the end of Intel's efforts to become a major supplier of AI accelerator chips. Instead, the company is pivoting to broader AI solutions for data centers. Jaguar Shores can be paired with the company's Xeon server CPUs and other Intel technologies, a strategy that certainly makes sense, given the difficulties Intel has had selling its Gaudi chips.\n\n\"Falcon Shores will help us in that process of working on the system, networking memory, all the component functions of that, but what customers really want is that full-scale rack solution. And so, we're able to get to that with Jaguar Shores,\" said Intel interim co-CEO Michelle Holthaus.\n\nNo AI comeback in 2025\n\nJaguar Shores isn't expected to launch until sometime in 2026, and Intel's shift away from focusing on stand-alone AI accelerators may further depress interest in the company's Gaudi family of chips. 2024 was a disappointing year for Intel's AI business, and 2025 isn't looking much better.\n\nIn the long run, Intel's new focus on AI systems rather than AI chips might be the best way for the company to finally break into the data center AI market. Gaudi certainly had potential, but the company bungled its opportunity to become a major player in the AI accelerator market.\n\nIntel can still turn itself around, but AI chips won't be a factor. Instead, the company will need to rely on its foundry business and its upcoming PC and server CPUs to carry it to the finish line.",

            "content": "Intel's Arrow Lake-based Core Ultra 7 255H appears to have been tested in PassMark, where it outperformed its Meteor Lake equivalent by 32% in single-threaded tests (via x86deadandback at X). Across a wide variety of metrics, the 255H is roughly 15% faster in CPU Mark, which is PassMark's proprietary metric for gauging a CPU's performance.\n\nIntel revealed its Arrow Lake-H family of processors at CES, shortly followed by a user review at Bilibili, which left much to be desired from these CPUs. Dubbed Core Ultra 200H, these processors employ Intel's Arrow Lake architecture featuring Lion Cove P-cores and Skymont E-cores. What separates them from desktop chips, apart from the power envelope, is that these CPUs feature an LPE (Low Power Efficient) core cluster on the SoC Tile, a feature reused from Meteor Lake.\n\nUnlike Lunar Lake which uses Battlemage (Xe2) graphics, Arrow Lake-H is armed with up to eight Xe-LPG+ (Alchemist+) cores with support for XMX. As the SoC Tile remains unchanged, Arrow Lake-H's NPU is capable of dishing out just 13 TOPS of INT8 performance, versus 45 TOPS on Lunar Lake. What is similar to Lunar Lake is the process node: TSMC's N3B, a step-up from Intel 4 used with Meteor Lake.\n\nThe Core Ultra 7 255H in question packs 16 cores, divided into six P-cores, eight E-cores, and two LPE-cores with 16 threads in total, as Arrow Lake lacks hyperthreading support. The Core Ultra 7 155H on the contrary is equipped with a similar layout but 22 threads. In PassMark's single-core benchmark, the 255H blazes past its predecessor, scoring 4,631 points compared to the 155H's 3,500 points for a 32% lead. This is a direct result of the updated Lion Cove P-cores and N3B process, allowing a 300 MHz bump in boost clocks. When aggregated, the CPU Mark rating puts Arrow Lake ahead by around 15%.\n\nRelatively speaking, efficiency remains the Achilles' heel of these chips, as the 16-core Core Ultra 9 285H failed to beat the 10-core Ryzen AI 9 365 when limited to 50W of power. While Arrow Lake-H offers an updated Compute Tile and a slightly modified Graphics Tile, the SoC, and IOE Tiles are largely carried over from Meteor Lake.\n\nIt all comes down to how these laptops are priced since Strix Point devices still have an entry price of around $1,000. On that note, it is important to mention that the 15W variant of these Intel chips, Core Ultra 200U, is reported to be based on Meteor Lake with Redwood Cove+ P-cores and Crestmont+ E-cores fabbed on Intel 3, a node once reserved for Intel's server counterparts. This will allow Intel to extract higher margins with possibly lower prices for us, though we haven't exactly found affordable Arrow Lake laptops to be abundant, at least not yet.",

            "content": "Generally speaking long term investing is the way to go. But along the way some stocks are going to perform badly. Zooming in on an example, the Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) share price dropped 71% in the last half decade. We certainly feel for shareholders who bought near the top. And some of the more recent buyers are probably worried, too, with the stock falling 54% in the last year. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 14% in the last three months. We note that the company has reported results fairly recently; and the market is hardly delighted. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.\n\nAfter losing 6.7% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Intel\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nOver five years Intel's earnings per share dropped significantly, falling to a loss, with the share price also lower. At present it's hard to make valid comparisons between EPS and the share price. But we would generally expect a lower price, given the situation.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\n\nNasdaqGS:INTC Earnings Per Share Growth February 2nd 2025\n\nIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Intel's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nWhat About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?\n\nWe've already covered Intel's share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Its history of dividend payouts mean that Intel's TSR, which was a 67% drop over the last 5 years, was not as bad as the share price return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWhile the broader market gained around 25% in the last year, Intel shareholders lost 54%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 11% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you check here to see what price insiders were buying at.",

(U.S. Navy Courtesy Photo) see less | View Image Page\n\nU.S. Navy Story by Cmdr. Lauren McKinley\n\n\n\nSchenectady, New York \u2013 Intelligence Specialist First Class David C. Milliman Jr. is a Schenectady native who drills out of Navy Reserve Center Schenectady and is assigned as a Senior Intelligence Analyst with the Twenty Second Naval Construction Regiment in Gulfport, Mississippi.\n\n\n\nA 1995 graduate of Mohonasen High School, he joined the U.S. Navy Reserve at the age of 38 in 2016 to give back to his country and carry on his family\u2019s tradition of military service. He credits the values of the hometown in which he grew up, including a respect for the ideals of persistence, dedication, and hard work, as a factor in the success he has enjoyed in his nine years of military service.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have had a \u2018Start Something, Finish Something\u2019 attitude from the beginning. My parents were always very supportive of my goals in life,\u201d he said. Their support and encouragement have always stuck with me, in that if I have a dream, I should have the confidence to dive in and go for it and not give up on myself.\u201d\n\n\n\nMilliman\u2019s most recent assignment was in support of the 2025 Presidential Inauguration Navy Liaison Team in Washington, D.C. He was in charge of a team who prepared the credentials and forwarded background checks to the United States Secret Service for all Navy reservists participating in the inauguration events. In his civilian capacity, he works as a New York State Unified Court System Officer, and he credited the skills he learned in the law enforcement and security sector to his success in this assignment.\n\n\n\nPrior to his accession into military service, Milliman earned a Baccalaureate Degree as an Art major from the Pratt Art Institute in Brooklyn, NY. This discipline of study inculcated in him a level of creative thinking and the ability to view problems from different perspectives, which as an intelligence specialist assists him in creating quality intelligence products by which military planning teams build military courses of action to support strategic national defense priorities.\n\n\n\nHe reflected on his accomplishments in the intelligence field, discussing his support of operational and tactical levels of war and developing products which directly supported warfighters. Ultimately, he seeks to train the next generation of intelligence specialists and was most proud to witness his Junior Sailors earn recognition and accolades for their work.\n\n\n\nVice Admiral Nancy Lacore, chief of the Navy Reserve and commander, Navy Reserve Force, highlights the importance of the unique skillsets Reserve Sailors like Milliman bring to the Total (Navy) Force, \u201cOur Sailors understand the significance of our mobilization billets and warfighting contributions to the Total Force. We possess specialized skillsets and capabilities, unique to the Reserve Force, and provide the Navy additional capacity\u2026We will retain and promote Sailors who embody our culture of excellence, resilience, and warfighting readiness.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo that end, Petty Officer Milliman discussed what readiness means for a citizen Sailor.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have to play the long game. When you play Chess, you have to think a few moves ahead. This translates to the experience of a warfighter. When you are preparing for an exercise, you need to think ahead of what you are going to need. The same is true for drill weekend, preparing for mobilization, or returning from mobilization. You need to prepare yourself mentally and physically to accomplish your tasks to set yourself up for success.\u201d\n\n\n\nMillman\u2019s story is an example of a citizen Sailor\u2019s passion for serving his country while balancing the demands of a civilian career and family life. When speaking of people desiring to serve the country, Milliman simply said, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to take chances in life.\u201d",

Since the ARL-S variants have brought in a rather disappointing performance, the next point of optimism is Nova Lake. Intel has offered little to no details regarding Nova Lake, but it seems like a new leak from the Redditor @Exist50 (via HXL) has given us a rundown of potential specifications of Nova Lake-S, HX, U, and H lineups, and they look pretty interesting.\n\nNova Lake Configuration Rumors NVL-SK: 2*8+16\n\nNVL-HX: 1*8+16\n\nNVL-S/NVL-H: 4+8\n\nNVL-U: 4+0https://t.co/olvUda0A2p \u2014 HXL (@9550pro) January 31, 2025\n\nIntel's upcoming CPU lineup is said to feature a max core configuration of 2*8 P-Cores along with 16 E-Cores, which will mark a decent improvement from Arrow Lake-S's flagship CPU, the Core Ultra 9 285K. Along with this, we are looking at other lineups, such as Nova Lake-H, that will debut in the mobile segment. Here's what Nova Lake's core configuration looks like:\n\nNVL-SK: 2*8+16\n\nNVL-HX: 1*8+16\n\nNVL-S/NVL-H: 4+8\n\nNVL-U: 4+0\n\nBased on the details, the Intel Nova Lake-S top configuration can offer up to 16 P-Cores and 32 E-Cores. It looks like Intel will be going with a dual compute tile, which would lead to these increased core counts as a means to tackle AMD's upcoming Zen 6 offerings, which are also expected to bump up the core configurations up to 32 cores per CCD.\n\nIntel's Nova Lake-S Desktop CPUs will be the true successor to the Arrow Lake-S lineup and should be part of the \"Core Ultra 400\" series as the \"Core Ultra 300\" series will utilize the Panther Lake CPU design, but those chips aren't expected to launch on mainstream desktop platforms. They are expected to use Coyote Core P-Cores and Arctic Wolf E-Cores, and that's all we know for now, but given that Nova Lake is scheduled to launch next year, we do expect more information to surface in upcoming times.\n\nIntel Desktop CPU Generations Comparison:",

The payment marks a significant development in the ongoing legal battles between corporations and EU competition authorities over refunded penalties.\n\nIntel initially faced a 1.06 billion euro fine from the European Commission in 2009 for allegedly engaging in anti-competitive practices. However, the company successfully contested the fine, convincing Europe\u2019s second-highest court to overturn it. This led Intel to sue the European Commission in 2022, seeking 593 million euros in default interest on the refunded amount, per Reuters.\n\nAccording to EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera, the Commission disbursed the default interest to Intel on November 6, 2024. In a written comment to a European Parliament lawmaker, Ribera confirmed that the total payment amounted to precisely 515,547,908.15 euros.\n\nSource: Qualcomm-Intel Merger Talks Raise Antitrust Concerns; Analysts Question Viability\n\nThis case highlights a growing trend where companies are increasingly turning to the courts to demand default interest on reimbursed fines in annulled antitrust cases. The legal precedent set by such disputes may influence future interactions between corporations and EU regulatory bodies, particularly in competition law enforcement.\n\nWhile Intel secured the annulment of most of the Commission\u2019s original decision, EU regulators upheld findings that the company had made payments to major computer manufacturers\u2014including HP, Acer, and Lenovo\u2014to delay or block rival products. As a result, Intel was fined an additional 376 million euros in 2023, per Reuters.\n\nSource: Reuters",

            "content": "Intel (INTC 0.46%) made significant progress last year in its server central processing unit (CPU) business. The company has been losing market share to AMD for years, partly because it was stuck on its aging Intel 7 manufacturing process. Sapphire Rapids and Emerald Rapids, which both launched in 2023, struggled to keep up with AMD's server CPUs and featured maximum core counts well below the competition.\n\nIn 2024, Intel rolled out two new families of server CPUs. The company split its server CPU lineup in two, with Sierra Forest packing power-sipping efficiency cores designed for cloud workloads and Granite Rapids featuring powerful cores meant to tackle the most compute-intensive applications. Sierra Forest offered as many as 144 cores on a single chip, while Granite Rapids maxed out at 128 cores. For perspective, Emerald Rapids went up to only 64 cores.\n\nBoth Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids are built on the Intel 3 process. Intel 3 still isn't on par with the most advanced processes offered by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), but it's a massive leap forward compared to Intel 7. While Intel certainly didn't leapfrog AMD with either product line, the company made up a lot of ground in terms of performance and efficiency.\n\nPushing back Clearwater Forest\n\nThe successor to Sierra Forest will be Clearwater Forest. The Forest family of server CPUs is critical for Intel as it battles AMD's efficiency-focused models and the ongoing incursion of Arm-based CPUs into the data center. For cloud computing providers, there's a major cost benefit to packing as many CPU cores as possible into the smallest footprint.\n\nClearwater Forest was originally expected to launch this year, but that's no longer the case. During the fourth-quarter earnings call, the company disclosed that Clearwater Forest was being pushed back to the first half of 2026.\n\nClearwater Forest will be built on the upcoming Intel 18A process, which is expected to bring Intel back to parity with TSMC. The good news is that Intel 18A is progressing as expected. The bad news is that complicated packaging requirements are causing issues for Clearwater Forest.\n\nWith Clearwater Forest no longer a 2025 product, Intel will be banking on Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids to stabilize its market share. \"This year is all about improving Xeon's competitive position as we fight harder to close the gap to competition. The ramp of Granite Rapids has been a good first step,\" said interim co-CEO Michelle Holthaus during the fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nClearwater Forest has the potential to be a big winner for Intel. The Intel 18A process features a new transistor design and backside power delivery for improved efficiency and performance, giving the company a potential edge over AMD's products. Clearwater Forest will also feature \"Local Cache,\" which puts ultra-fast cache memory close to the CPU cores. Unfortunately for Intel, these innovations won't make it to market until sometime next year.\n\nStopping the bleeding\n\nWhile the next major development for Intel's server CPU business is now more than a year away, the company is taking other steps to halt AMD's market share gains. Granite Rapids originally launched with record-high list prices, but Intel has since quietly reduced those list prices by large margins. The value proposition for Granite Rapids is now much stronger on paper, although the actual prices paid by large customers buying in massive volumes are unknown.\n\nIntel's data center segment has been contracting due to a combination of tough competition from AMD and a shift in focus among data center customers toward AI accelerators. Intel's data center revenue declined 3% year over year in the fourth quarter to $3.4 billion, and segment operating profit plunged to just $233 million. The data center segment used to be a lucrative cash cow for Intel, but that's no longer the case.\n\nAs Intel works toward launching Clearwater Forest and Diamond Rapids, the successor to Granite Rapids, in 2026, the name of the game this year is stopping its market share losses in the data center. The company has a solid product lineup with Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids and now has attractive pricing as well. While a comeback will take time and the Clearwater Forest delay is disappointing, Intel's server CPU business still appears to be on the right track.",

            "content": "Comment Any hope Intel may have had of challenging rivals Nvidia and AMD for a slice of the AI accelerator market dissolved on Thursday as yet another GPU architecture was scrapped.\n\nFalcon Shores, which was due out this year and was expected to combine the best of Intel's Xe Graphics capabilities with Gaudi's AI grunt, will never leave the x86 giant's labs, interim co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus revealed on the corporation's Q4 earnings call with analysts Thursday. \"We plan to leverage Falcon shores as an internal test chip only, without bringing it to market.\"\n\nThe decision means Intel is likely to be another year if not two out from launching its next GPU architecture, codenamed Jaguar Shores, and that assumes it doesn't suffer the same fate as Ponte Vecchio, Rialto Bridge, and now Falcon Shores.\n\nThat's right, this isn't the first or even second time that development of a GPU capable of taking on Nvidia let alone AMD has been cut short by Intel. Nearly two years ago, Intel axed Rialto Bridge, the successor to its datacenter-class GPU Max chips slated to power America's Aurora supercomputer. At least those earlier Max chips saw limited deployments by the likes of Argonne National Laboratory in the US, the UK's Dawn super, and Germany's SuperMUC-NG Phase 2 system.\n\nWe say limited because Intel ended up pulling the plug on GPU Max in mid-2024, presumably to focus on its Gaudi family of accelerators \u2014 more on those later \u2014 and prepare for the Falcon Shores debut.\n\nGiven this context, the demise of Falcon Shores, in some sense, felt inevitable. Intel's roadmap had it set for a 2024 release, but that was pushed back a year around the time Rialto Bridge was binned. Back then, the Falcon Shores project included an XPU variant that combined CPU and GPU dies on a single package. In mid-2023, those plans were pared back, leaving a more traditional GPU approach. Now Falcon Shores is basically dead entirely.\n\nSo what about Gaudi?\n\nDespite going one for three on high-end GPUs so far, Intel isn't entirely out of the AI game just yet. The x86 player still has its Gaudi3 accelerators.\n\nOn paper the accelerators didn't look half bad, when they were unveiled in April. The dedicated AI accelerator boasted 1,835 teraFLOPS of dense floating-point performance at either 8- or 16-bit precision. For compute-bound workloads commonly run at BF16, Gaudi3 boasted nearly twice the performance of Nvidia's H100 or H200.\n\nFor memory-bound workloads, such as inference, Gaudi3 packs 128GB of HBM2e memory good for 3.7 TBps of bandwidth, enabling it to contend with larger models than Nvidia's H100 while theoretically providing higher throughput.\n\nUnfortunately for Intel, Gaudi3 is no longer competing with H100s. While it made its debut in early 2024, the part only began trickling out to system manufacturers late last year with general availability slated for this quarter.\n\nThat means potential buyers are now cross-shopping the part against Nvidia's Blackwell and AMD's MI325X systems. For training, Blackwell offers greater floating-point precision; more, faster memory; and a substantially larger scale-up domain. Meanwhile, AMD's MI325X boasts twice the capacity, and 62 percent more memory bandwidth, giving it the edge in inferencing where capacity and bandwidth are king.\n\nThis might explain why despite then-CEO Pat Gelsinger's insistence that Gaudi3 would drive more than $500 million in accelerator revenue in the second half of 2024, Intel fell short of that target. And that's despite an extremely competitive price point compared to Nvidia.\n\nThere could be all kinds of reasons for this, ranging from system performance to the maturity of competing software ecosystems. However, Intel's bigger problem is that Gaudi3 is a dead-end platform.\n\nIts successor was supposed to be a variant of Falcon Shores that from what we understand was supposed to mesh its enormous systolic arrays with Intel's Xe graphics architecture.\n\nPerhaps we'll see Gaudi3 win some ground in 2025, but given the complete lack of an upgrade path and uncertainty around Jaguar Shores, it seems unlikely many are going to take the risk when alternative platforms from chip designers with proven roadmaps and track records are available.\n\nIntel's shrinking place in the AI datacenter\n\nRegardless of which GPUs or AI accelerators datacenter operators end up buying, they still need a host CPU, so Intel won't be cut out of the AI datacenter entirely.\n\n\"We have a leading position as the host CPU for AI servers, and we continue to see a significant opportunity for CPU based inference on-prem and at the edge as AI infused applications proliferate,\" Holthaus told Wall Street this week.\n\nWe continue to see a significant opportunity for CPU based inference on-prem and at the edge\n\nIntel's Granite Rapids Xeons launched last year have proven to be its most compelling in years, boasting core counts up to 128 cores, 256 threads, support for speedy 8,800 MT/s MRDIMMS, up to 96 lanes of PCIe 5.0 per socket.\n\nHowever, this segment is getting a lot more competitive. It's hard to ignore the gains AMD continues to make in the datacenter with its Epyc processor family. The Ryzen slinger now commands about 24.2 percent of the server CPU market, according to Mercury Research.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia, which is a long-time Intel partner having used its CPUs in several generations of DGX reference designs, is increasingly relying on its Arm-based Grace processors for its top-specced accelerators. Nv still supports the HGX form-factor with eight GPUs per system that we've grown accustomed to, and so Intel still can win share in this arena \u2014 for now.\n\nBut with, AMD making a point of how well optimized its Turin-generation of CPUs are for GPU servers, we anticipate vendors will gravitate to some degree to all-AMD configurations with Epyc and Instinct for their builds, further inhibiting Intel's ability to compete in this space\n\nOpportunities at the edge\n\nIntel's opportunities to capitalize on the AI boom may be shrinking in the datacenter, Chipzilla still has a shot at the network edge and on the PC.\n\nLike most personal computer hardware makers, Intel has been banging the AI PC drum even before Microsoft spilled the beans on its 40 TOPS Copilot+ performance requirements.\n\nAnd while this led to a somewhat awkward moment in which Qualcomm was, for a few months, the sole supplier of Copilot+ compatible processors, both AMD and Intel were able to catch up with the launch of Strix Point and Lunar Lake in July and September, respectively.\n\nAs we explored at Computex, Lunar Lake boasts a 48 TOPS NPU alongside a GPU and CPU, and Intel claims the system-on-chips can deliver 120 total system TOPS between the three.\n\nHowever, more importantly for Intel, it still controls the lion's share of the CPU market for PCs.\n\nAnd while just how important these AI features will ultimately be for PC customers is still up for debate, and Intel faces stiff competition from AMD, Qualcomm, and Nvidia at the higher-end of the PC spectrum, it's squarely in the race.\n\nAlong with the emerging AI PC market, Intel's CPU strategy could help it secure wins at the network edge where it can flex the Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) compute blocks that have been baked into its CPUs going back to Sapphire Rapids to run machine-learning and generative-AI workloads without the need for a GPU.\n\nIntel has previously demonstrated 4-bit quantized 70-billion-parameter LLMs running at reasonable 12 tokens a second on its Granite Rapids Xeons, thanks to its MRDIMM memory support.\n\nExtrapolating this performance out, we'd expect to see generation rates of around 100 tokens a second for an 8-billion-parameter model, at least for a batch size of one. As we've previously explored in detail, the economics of CPU-only AI still aren't great with batch size being one of the limiting factors.\n\nBut, for a network edge appliance which might only need to run models periodically, this not only wouldn't be a problem, but it'd potentially help to eliminate complexity and points of failure compared to GPU-based solutions.\n\nDon't count a comeback out just yet\n\nIf the rebirth of AMD in the post-Bulldozer era teaches us anything, it's not to count an Intel come back out.\n\nWhen Ryzen and Epyc made their debut in the late 2010s, the parts weren't the most performant, but they were differentiated, offering customers something they couldn't get from Intel: Loads of cheap good-enough cores.\n\nIn the GPU space, AMD employed a similar strategy, first focusing on delivering better performance in high-performance computing (HPC) applications than Nvidia. This helped AMD secure several high profile wins for its Instinct accelerators with America's Frontier and more recently El Capitan supercomputers.\n\nWith its MI300-series accelerators and the pivot to AI, AMD differentiated again, targeting higher memory capacities than Nvidia could offer. This helped it secure wins from major hyperscalers and cloud providers, such as Microsoft and Meta, who were trying to reduce the cost of memory-bound workloads including inference.\n\nWe bring this up because the decision to scrap Falcon Shores presents Intel an opportunity to start afresh and build something unencumbered by architectural decisions no longer representative of what the market actually wants.\n\nThe decision to refocus Jaguar Shores toward a rack-scale design is a promising sign of what's to come. If Intel can find a way to differentiate its next GPU and provide something customers want but simply can't get from its competitors, it at least stands a chance of reestablishing a foothold in the datacenter. \u00ae",

It\u2019s another side effect of these being high-end laptops.\n\nOne key difference between Intel Ultra and Snapdragon laptops, though, is that the latter machines do not support Thunderbolt ports. They\u2019ll most likely have USB 4 connectors instead. These two are the same in terms of port type and are ultra-fast \u2013 just don't offer the same speeds. Laptops with them will typically support connection to up to two 4K monitors. The number and type of connections you get in a particular model are going to be far more important for most folks than Thunderbolt versus USB 4.\n\nQualcomm vs Intel: Performance\n\nCredit: Future\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon X Elite has the edge for work\n\nIntel Ultra Series 2 takes an easy win for gaming\n\nThey\u2019re both super-efficient\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a clear split in the performance of Intel Ultra Series 2 Lunar Lake and Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite laptops. The most interesting part? Intel steamrolls Qualcomm for gaming.\n\nWith an Asus ZenBook S14, Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s benchmark glides by comfortably at a 48fps average with medium settings, 1080p resolution. The Qualcomm-powered Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 only averages 26fps. That\u2019s a massive 84% additional frames per second for the Intel laptop, heading from jerky to playable.\n\nWe've seen similar results elsewhere in big games through the years. Lord of the Rings: Shadow of Mordor ran 50% better, with a 96fps average to the Qualcomm\u2019s 64fps average. Alien Isolation ran 82% better on the Intel laptop, with 102fps to 56fps. In almost every game, the Intel-powered PC had far better results than the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite one.\n\nYou can play pretty demanding and recent games with an Intel Lunar Lake laptop, without using embarrassingly poor resolutions and graphics settings. It\u2019s going to be much more of a strain with a Qualcomm Snapdragon system. And, sure, while the the snobs will point out neither has the grunt of a dedicated gaming laptop, can those systems play for up to 2.5 hours off battery? And without losing most of their performance? And not cause a racket at the same time? Didn\u2019t think so!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a bit of a flip when we look at raw processor performance, though. By our numbers, the Intel Ultra 7 Lunar Lake laptop is noticeably less punchy on raw CPU power than a Qualcomm.\n\nThis has varied a bit between models of Snapdragon X Elite PCs, even when they have exactly the same specs on paper. It\u2019s likely because there\u2019s a balance of both noise and power consumption when on battery, which matters because the latter is one of the top features of these laptops.\n\nIf you want your laptop to go in all guns-a-blazing, you\u2019ll have to put in a decent fan even with one of these AI laptops. Sure, it\u2019ll only make a fraction of the noise of a gaming laptop or even some older ultraportables, but I\u2019m yet to use a truly fanless one of these laptops. Even the tablet-style Surface Pro 11 has one, where the MacBook Air is currently a fanless design.\n\nBut if you want peak number crunching rather than gaming, Qualcomm Snapdragon laptops win in this fight, albeit with some qualification.\n\nQualcomm vs Intel: Battery life\n\nCredit: Future\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreat light use battery life from both camps\n\nThe capacity is going to matter more than anything else\n\nOut tests show Intel may have a slight edge\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon laptops slightly blew minds with their battery life when they arrived. They absolutely trashed the first-generation Intel Ultra crowd, and outlasted the traditional battery-lover\u2019s choice, AMD Ryzen, without a massive drop of performance on battery.\n\nSecond-generation Intel Ultra chipsets then arrived and pretty much did the same thing. In our experience, the longevity of the two breeds of laptop are comparable.\n\nHowever, second-generation Intel Ultra Asus laptop we reviewed did outlast most of the Snapdragon X Elite crowd. It ran for 18 hours of video, and around 2.5 hours of Cyberpunk 2077. There\u2019s perhaps room for Intel to sneak a victory here, but the difference is not worth hinging your purchase decision on.\n\nFor light tasks you\u2019re looking at real-world battery life well into the teens of hours. That\u2019s for jobs like writing documents, video streaming or browsing where you aren\u2019t keeping 17,000 tabs open the entire time. We are guilty of doing that about 94% of the time.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, serious system-straining gaming might leave you with around 2.5 hours of battery life or less. That\u2019s better than a proper gaming laptop, but clearly worse than a Nintendo Switch OLED, whose power draw is reportedly limited to around 6.5W when playing a tough game like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\n\nCompare it to the often sub-60-minute longevity of a hulking gaming laptop, though, and you start to appreciate the flexibility of these new AI PCs.\n\nQualcomm vs Intel: Compatibility\n\nCredit: Future\n\nIntel Ultra is better for app compatibility\n\n\u2026but Qualcomm Snapdragon is surprisingly good\n\nBoth run apps like any old Windows laptop\n\nDespite being around for months longer than the 2nd Generation Intel Ultra laptops, Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptops have far more compatibility issues. Do most apps work? Sure. Do most games work? Yep. But we have encountered a handful of issues during our testing that just aren\u2019t a problem with Intel Ultra Series 2 generation PCs.\n\nThese include hardware accessories that you plug in but flat-out won't be recognised, some games crashing on start-up, and some apps complaining they need an \u201cx86\u201d system to run.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout wanting to get too nerdy on you, this highlights the big difference between Snapdragon and Intel Ultra. The first uses an ARM architecture, once mostly reserved for phones, while even newer Intel Ultra chipsets are still of the classic x86 breed.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve been impressed by how well stuff runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptops, and how rarely you need to think about compatibility, you\u2019re likely to encounter issues before too long if you stray from the most popular or basic of apps. This also takes some of the shine off the raw processor power gains of Qualcomm systems. Bear that in mind.\n\nQualcomm vs Intel: Verdict\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptops and ones with second-generation Intel Ultra chipsets are made with the same job in mind. They are here for great battery life and AI-ready chops that can go head-to-head with the best from Apple.\n\nThe best all-rounder for the average buyer right now is probably an Intel Ultra Series 2 laptop, even if it doesn\u2019t win in all areas.\n\nA Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite will win on CPU power, while Intel claims the gaming and graphics victory. Either of those is pretty significant. But the fewer compatibility issues of the Intel Ultra series pushes it over the top for us. However, at the time of writing some will want to wait for more options to appear in retailers.",

Revenue declined 7 percent to US$14.3 billion, which was slightly better than expected by analysts. The company\u2019s share price rose 2 percent in after-hours trading following the earnings release.\n\n\u201cWhile Intel\u2019s revenue decline remains concerning, the overall results came in ahead of the most pessimistic forecasts, possibly propped by broader market and geopolitical factors,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said.\n\nA smartphone displaying the Intel logo is placed amid printed circuit boards in an illustration taken on March 6 last year. Photo: Reuters\n\nFor the full year, Intel recorded a substantial net loss of US$18.8 billion, compared to a profit of US$1.7 billion in 2023, largely due to restructuring charges and challenging market conditions.\n\nIntel chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger was forced out last month after the board lost confidence in his plans to turn the company around.\n\nHis abrupt departure came after the company in August last year vowed to cut more than 15,000 jobs in a draconian cost reduction plan, and paused or delayed construction on several chipmaking facilities.\n\nIntel\u2019s shares fell 60 percent last year, and its market valuation is about US$90 billion, just a fraction of Nvidia Corp, which makes the premium graphics processing units (GPUs) that are fueling the AI boom.\n\nDespite the losses, interim co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus highlighted positive developments.\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter was a positive step forward as we delivered revenue, gross margin and EPS above our guidance,\u201d Holthaus said.\n\nShe told analysts during an earnings call that Intel could find opportunities to capitalize on buzz generated this week by Chinese start-up DeepSeek (\u6df1\u5ea6\u6c42\u7d22), with its powerful new chatbot developed at a fraction of the cost of its US competitors.\n\n\u201cBecause if we\u2019ve seen anything this week, when there are constraints put on customers, they figure out different ways to deploy technology,\u201d Holthaus said when asked about DeepSeek.\n\nIntel has chips and other assets it can \u201cleverage\u201d to win over customers looking to power AI without having to resort to premium Nvidia GPUs, Holthaus said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great opportunity, and something that I\u2019m looking at to see if there are ways that we can be disruptive there,\u201d Holthaus said.\n\nThe company\u2019s Client Computing Group, which includes PC chips, saw revenue fall 9 percent to US$8 billion in the fourth quarter. However, Intel reported strong momentum in AI components for PCs, saying it is on track to ship more than 100 million AI PCs by the end of this year.\n\nIntel has been engaged with the new administration of US President Donald Trump and \u201cfeels good\u201d about the effort to promote chipmaking in the US, co-chief executive David Zinsner said. \u201cThis is a very positive sign, obviously, for us.\u201d\n\nThe earnings report came as Intel continues its search for a permanent CEO.",

Despite the recent move away from Falcon Shores in the server sector, the schedule for desktop and mobile processors appears to remain stable. This was confirmed by Intel during the Q4-2024 earnings call.\n\nPanther Lake as the first CPU generation on Intel 18A\n\nAccording to Co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus, Panther Lake will be the first CPU series based on the new 18A process technology. Intel is optimistic that this technology will prove itself in terms of performance and efficiency. Panther Lake will go into mass production in the second half of 2025 and will be launched on the market in the same year. However, it remains unclear whether Panther Lake will also be released for desktop systems or whether the focus will be exclusively on mobile platforms.\n\nQuote from Holthaus:\n\n\u201cLater this year, we will strengthen our client portfolio with the launch of Panther Lake, our flagship product on Intel 18A. As the first volume customer of Intel 18A, I see the progress Intel Foundry is making in terms of performance and yield. I look forward to production in the second half of the year to demonstrate the benefits of our world-class design and process technology.\u201d\n\nNova Lake: Mobile and desktop platform confirmed\n\nIntel plans to launch the Nova Lake architecture in 2026. In contrast to Panther Lake, where there are still uncertainties, Nova Lake explicitly emphasizes that the series will be released for both desktop and mobile platforms. With Nova Lake, Intel promises a significant improvement in performance and an optimized cost structure at the same time.\n\nQuote from Holthaus:\n\n\u201c2026 will be even more exciting from a client perspective as Panther Lake reaches significant volumes and we introduce our next generation called Nova Lake. Both will deliver strong performance across the PC spectrum, with significantly better cost and margin structures for us, improving our competitiveness.\u201d\n\nFirst benchmark leaks on Panther Lake\n\nPanther Lake processors have already appeared in the first benchmarks. Recently, an entry was spotted in the SiSoftware database showing the theoretical performance of an early sample. However, such values should be treated with caution, as they generally do not yet reflect the final performance. It remains to be seen how the CPUs will perform in real tests. According to current rumors, Intel could officially unveil the mobile Panther Lake-H CPUs at CES 2026. If the CPUs are released earlier, this would confirm that Intel is sticking to its ambitious schedule. It is still unclear whether there will be a desktop version. There has been no official confirmation to date, even though Intel has made optimistic statements about the future of client processors.\n\nSource: Intel (PDF)",

It was first envisioned as an XPU that would meld CPU and GPU tiles, and later pared back to a GPU that would combine Intel's Xe graphics lineage with Habana's AI chemistry. Now it seems the chip will never leave Intel's labs.\n\nWe plan to leverage Falcon shores as an internal test chip only\n\n\"Many of you heard me temper expectations on Falcon Shores last month,\" Holthaus told financial analysts on a conference call a few hours ago. \"Based on industry feedback, we plan to leverage Falcon shores as an internal test chip only, without bringing it to market. This will support our efforts to develop a system-level solution at rack scale with Jaguar Shores to address the AI data center more broadly.\"\n\nThe revelations mark the latest blow to Intel's AI ambitions for the datacenter world. Last quarter, Intel admitted its Gaudi3 accelerators had failed to deliver on the $500 million revenues forecast for 2024.\n\n\"This is an attractive market for us over time, but I am not happy with where we are today,\" Holthaus said. \"On the one hand, we have a leading position as the host CPU for AI servers, and we continue to see a significant opportunity for CPU-based inference on-prem and at the edge as AI-infused applications proliferate.\n\n\"On the other hand, we're not yet participating in the cloud based AI data center market in a meaningful way.\"\n\nIntel's Xeon roadmap gets lost in Clearwater Forest\n\nWhile Falcon Shores has effectively been canned, Intel's Clearwater Forest Xeons have only been delayed. The parts, slated to be among Intel's first datacenter products on its all-new 18A (1.8nm-class) process nodes, are now expected to arrive in the first half of 2026.\n\nAccording to Holthaus, the rationale boils down to demand for Xeons bristling with E-cores: \"What we've seen is that's more of a niche market, and we haven't seen volume materialize there as fast as we expected.\"\n\nThe decision to delay Clearwater Forest is less surprising as its original release schedule had it awkwardly close to the release of Intel's 288-core Sierra Forest Xeon 6 processors due out earlier this year.\n\nWhile Clearwater Forest won't make its debut this year, Holthaus insists the 18A process tech is still on track and will ramp alongside the launch of Intel's Panther Lake client CPUs in the second half of the year.\n\n\"As the first volume customer of Intel 18A, I see the progress that Intel Foundry is making on performance and yield, and I look forward to being in production in the second half, as we demonstrate the benefits of our world class design,\" Holthaus emphasized.\n\nShe also revealed that Panther Lake would be followed by a next-gen product called Nova Lake, which would utilize a mix of internal and external fab processes, meaning a reliance on non-Intel factories.\n\nPat's Foundry vision lives on while search for CEO continues\n\nSpeaking of 18A, it's been nearly two months since chief exec Pat Gelsinger's abrupt \"retirement\" and the chipmaker has not yet named a worthy successor.\n\n\"The board remains intensely focused on the search for a permanent CEO,\" interim co-CEO and CFO David Zinsner said on the conference call. \"The search is progressing, but we have nothing new to report,\" he added, preemptively shutting down questions ahead of a Q&A with Wall Street.\n\nEven without a permanent CEO at the helm, Holthaus and Zinsner are pushing ahead with Gelsinger's grand plan to reinvent Intel as a manufacturing heavyweight. The CFO emphasized that building a successful foundry business requires more than competitive process technology; it needs trust from the semiconductor industry, which can take time to build.\n\nWe're going to systematically attack our costs\n\nIn other words, don't expect the foundry's financial situation to change overnight, though improvements are on the horizon with the impending ramp of 18A, allegedly. \"We're going to systematically attack our costs and remain highly focused on our goal of delivering break even operating income for Intel foundry by the end of 2027 and we expect to demonstrate improvements this year,\" Zinsner said.\n\nWork in support of this goal is still ongoing. According to Intel, tool installation at its Fab 52 site in Arizona is underway to support the ramp of 18A later this year. To support this project, Intel says it collected $1.1 billion of the $7.86 billion in subsidies awarded by the US Department of Commerce late last year, and another $1.1 billion this month.\n\nIn terms of foundry customers and who on Earth they are exactly, Intel remains fairly tight lipped. It claimed in December it completed a tape out of a 16nm-class design for a customer expected to begin volume production at its Ireland facility later this year.\n\nIntel is expected to share more details regarding its manufacturing ramp in late April during its second annual foundry event in San Jose, California.\n\nSeasonality hits as Intel staunches the bleeding\n\nCompared to Intel's disastrous performance over the past few quarters, which were punctuated by multi-billion-dollar losses, missteps, and unmet promises, its final three months of 2024 were comparatively uneventful.\n\nIntel is still bleeding cash, recording a $100 million net loss in the fourth quarter, down 105 percent from the year-before's $2.7 billion profit. However, it managed to book revenues on the upper end of its guidance at $14.3 billion, albeit down seven percent year-on-year. So-called inter-segment eliminations also cost the chipmaker $4.3 billion in sales, it noted.\n\nFor more commentary and analysis, don't miss The Next Platform's coverage of Intel's fortunes and future.\n\nDigging a little deeper, Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) once again did the heavy lifting, accounting for $8 billion of the corporation's revenues for the quarter, a decline of nine percent from the year prior.\n\nThe Datacenter and AI group fared a little better falling just three percent to $3.4 billion, while Intel's Networking and Edge (NEX) group was the lone bright spot in Intel's product mix with revenues growing 10 percent to $1.6 billion. However, NEX's rebound in edge demand wasn't nearly enough to overcome a six percent year-on-year decline in revenue, down to $13 billion, from the Intel products division.\n\nAnd while Zinsner remains confident in Intel's foundry fortunes, that division continues to struggle with revenues down 13 percent year-on-year to $4.5 billion and operating losses for the quarter totaling $2.26 billion, nearly twice that of Q4 2023's losses.\n\nDespite a challenging 2024, Intel's full-year revenues were almost flat at $53.1 billion, declining two percent compared to 2023. The same can't, however, be said of profits. The past 12 months saw Intel record $18.8 billion in losses versus a tidy $1.7 billion profit the year before. Gross margins dipped to 32.7 percent from the year-ago's 40 percent.\n\nLooking ahead to Q1 2025, Intel is targeting revenues of $11.7 to $12.7 billion, with Zinsner citing regular seasonality \u2013 Q1 is usually slower than Q4 for sales \u2013 for the weak outlook. \u00ae",

A: David Zinsner, Interim Co-CEO and CFO, noted that the revenue decline is the biggest contributor to lower gross margins in Q1. Intel Products' margins will be under pressure due to higher costs, particularly with Lunar Lake. Improvements are expected later in the year with Panther Lake and increased EUV wafer mix in Intel Foundry.\n\nQ: Why are all three product segments down equally in the next quarter? A: David Zinsner explained that macro uncertainty and typical seasonality are affecting all markets, leading to a cautious outlook across all segments.\n\nQ: How has your strategy evolved for Intel Foundry Services (IFS) under new co-leadership? A: David Zinsner emphasized a more conservative approach, focusing on not spending ahead of success and being cautious with capital deployment. The goal remains to build a world-class foundry, aligning with US government interests.\n\nQ: What was behind the tempering of expectations for Falcon Shores, and what does it take to get competitive in that space? A: Michelle Johnston Holthaus stated that the decision was based on competitive and execution perspectives.

            "content": "If Intel hopes to survive the next few years as a freestanding company and return to its role as innovator, it can not afford to waste its time and it cannot afford to make any more mistakes.\n\nWhich is why the new top brasses at Intel \u2013 chief executive officer of Intel Products Michelle Johnston Holthaus and chief financial officer Dave Zinsner, who are co-CEOs of the company \u2013 are pushing out the next generation of its E-core Xeon CPUs and turning a future AI accelerator that represents the convergence of its datacenter GPU and AI accelerator lines into a research platform as it goes back to the drawing board to create a rackscale AI design that presumably will do a better job competing against Nvidia.\n\nThe roadmap changes, which we backcast into our recent CPU roadmap story, were made during the call with Wall Street analysts yesterday going over Intel\u2019s financial results for Q4 2024. We will get to the numbers in a second, but first let\u2019s update the Intel datacenter compute engine roadmap, starting with the \u201cClearwater Forest\u201d Xeon 7 E-core chip that was expected later this year and that was expected to be the first datacenter chip to use its 18A RibbonFET manufacturing process.\n\n\u201cSo I really look at the datacenter market in kind of two buckets,\u201d Johnston Holthaus said on the call when asked about the timing change for Clearwater Rapids. \u201cWe have our P-core products, which you know is Granite Rapids and then we have our E-core products which equates to Clearwater Forest. And what we\u2019ve seen is that\u2019s more of a niche market, and we haven\u2019t seen volume materialize there, as fast as we expected. But as we look at Clearwater Forest, we expect that to come to market in the first half of 2026. 18A is doing just fine on its performance and yield for [Diamond] Rapids, but it does have some complicated packaging expectations that move it to 2026. But we expect that to be a good product and continue to close the gap as well. But this is going to be a journey.\u201d\n\nJohnston Holthaus said \u201cGranite Rapids\u201d in the paragraph above, but meant to say \u201cDiamond Rapids.\u201d The Granite Rapids Xeon 6 processor has already been launched and is etched with the Intel 3 process, which if you want to be generous is akin to 3 nanometer processes from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\n\nIt sounds to us that some of the packaging kinks need to be worked out for Xeon-class chips using 18A. We also think, given the niche nature of the E-core variants, Diamond Rapids P-core variants could come to market ahead of E-core Clearwater Forest variants. And if it gets crazy enough, the E-core chip could be moved to custom products and not rolled out as part of the official Xeon roadmap at some point.\n\nThe reason that might happen is simple: The E-core chips do not have full-on AVX vector math units and they do not have AMX matrix units or HyperThreading simultaneous multithreading. The first and second are increasingly important for AI inference and light AI training. AMD does not have matrix math units on any Epyc CPUs as yet, but it does have full-on vectors on boith the plain vanilla and skinny core \u201cC\u201d variants for the \u201cGenoa\u201d Epyc 9004 and \u201cTurin\u201d Epyc 9005 CPUs. The AMD approach to skinny cores is to cut the L3 cache in half for the C variants and rejigger the core such that you can fit more cores in a socket. With the Genoa chips, that was 33 percent more cores, and with Turin, it is 50 percent more.\n\nAs we put it at the Granite Rapids launch: Intel Brings A Big Fork To A Server CPU Knife Fight. It is amazing to us that Intel didn\u2019t do the same trick that AMD did to make a skinny core and preserve compatibility, and it is also amazing to us that hyperscalers and cloud builders indicated that they were fine with this forking of the architecture. Then again, a hyperscaler/cloud builder talking up FPGA-based DPUs is how Intel got scared into spending $16.7 billion on Altera. Sometimes, Intel gets a bad steer, and it doesn\u2019t compensate by stiffening its arms. (And to be fair, we caught a little FPGA religion, too, at the time, but still think Intel\u2019s exuberance was much larger than ours.)\n\nBecause of the intense competition that AMD is bringing with the Genoa and Turin datacenter CPUs, Intel has had to circle back and actually chop prices on the Granite Rapids chips, which were announced in September 2024 with the highest prices we have ever seen for Intel CPUs. This price cuts better align Granite Rapids chips to Genoa Epyc 9004 pricing, which was probably happening informally in every deal anyway. All five of the Granite Rapids chips that were announced last fall had a price cut, with three getting a 30 percent cut, one getting a 20 percent cut, and another getting a 13.4 percent cut. The top bin parts with 128 and 120 cores and the lower bin part with 72 cores had the deepest cuts.\n\nThat brings us to the ever-changing \u201cFalcon Shores\u201d accelerator.\n\nThree years ago, Intel was working on a GPU product line anchored by its \u201cPonte Vecchio\u201d Max GPU and followed by its \u201cRialto Bridge\u201d kicker and at the same time was creating a hybrid CPU-GPU device called Falcon Shores that, like AMD\u2019s MI300A, would mix Xeon CPU cores and matrix math units that were derived from these GPUs as well as the Gaudi line of XPUs that it got through its acquisition of Habana Labs. In February 2022, we contemplated what Falcon Shores might look like, and the expectation was that these accelerators would plug into the same sockets as the Granite Rapids CPUs.\n\nby March 2023, Intel\u2019s GPU efforts were in a shambles with Ponte Vecchio being very late and Rialto Bridge canceled. AT the time, there were rumors that Falcon Shores using only GPU engines would be the future discrete accelerator from Intel and that project was pushed out \u201cbeyond 2025.\u201d And in June 2023, Intel downplayed the whole idea of a hybrid CPU-GPU device and merged the Gaudi matrix math engines with the Falcom Shores all-GPU machine to create a new and improved plan for Falcon Shores. The idea was to take the wide Ethernet pipelines used in the Gaudi architecture and the Falcon Shores GPU and Gaudi matrix math to create a unified accelerator that could run workloads designed for Gaudi and Pente Vecchio.\n\nWell, forget all of that. Now everything is shifting out further to a still future accelerator called \u201cJaguar Shores.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not yet participating in the cloud-based AI data center market in a meaningful way,\u201d Johnston Holthaus said, stating what is obvious to us all given the explosive fortunes of Nvidia. \u201cWe have learned a lot as we have ramped Gaudi, and we are applying those learnings going forward. One of the immediate actions I have taken is to simplify our roadmap and concentrate our resources. Many of you heard me temper expectations on Falcon Shores last month. Based on industry feedback, we plan to leverage Falcon Shores as an internal test chip only, without bringing it to market. This will support our efforts to develop a system-level solution at rack scale with Jaguar Shores to address the AI datacenter. More broadly, as I think about our AI opportunity, my focus is on the problems our customers are trying to solve, most notably, to lower the cost and increase the efficiency of compute.\u201d\n\nSo that is the end of Falcon Shores and the beginning of Jaguar Shores, of which we know nothing other than the hinted at rackscale approach mentioned above.\n\nWith that, let\u2019s talk about Intel\u2019s datacenter business as it was in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn the December quarter, Intel\u2019s overall revenues were $14.26 billion, down 7.4 percent year on year, but up 7.3 percent sequentially. The company posted a $152 million net loss, compared to a $2.67 billion net gain in the year ago period, but a whole lot better than the nearly $17 billion loss it booked in Q3 2024 due mostly to restructuring charges.\n\nIntel ended the quarter with $22.06 billion in cash and investments in the bank, money it is correctly parceling out very carefully as it invests in products and foundries.\n\nHere is the breakdown of Intel\u2019s revenues and operating income by group for the past two years:\n\nAnd here is the same data shown graphically for revenues:\n\nIntel was able to hold revenues in its Datacenter and AI (DCAI) group relatively steady in the fourth quarter, with sales down 3.3 percent to $3.39 billion but up 1.1 percent sequentially. Operating profits were $233 million, a pretty anemic 6.9 percent of revenues and down 68.4 percent from the year ago quarter. Intel\u2019s profit levels for datacenter products has been declining over the past year, which is no doubt concerning and which is also compelling the company to break its Network and Edge (NEX) group into pieces, with Xeon processor and networking product sales in NEX eventually being merged back into DCAI. (Other parts of it will go into its Client Computing Group at some point in the future.)\n\nThe NEX group had a revenue bump of 10.3 percent to $1.62 billion, and operating income was $340 million (20.9 percent of sales), which is the healthiest profit levels Intel has had in this line of business in years. The Altera FPGA business, which we also think of as part of the core datacenter business, had sales of $429 million, down 10.6 percent, and operating income of $90 million, a factor of 21.5X higher than a year ago.\n\nWe have been tracking Intel\u2019s Data Center Group, the core business that was created for server products way back in the day, for a long time, and have used the combination of DCAI and a portion of NEX and Altera as a proxy for the historical Data Center Group that was first headed up by Pat Gelsinger so many years ago.\n\nHere is the trend:\n\nIntel\u2019s rise in the datacenter and its hegemony over server compute is evidenced in the run from 2009 through 2019, and you can see where AMD started taking share in 2020 and how this has caused Intel much grief since then.\n\nThe server CPU business has become intensely competitive, and it is safe to say that a lot of Intel\u2019s revenues are supply wins, not design wins, considering the much higher core counts and performance that AMD delivers for most workloads at this point.\n\nIntel used to sell flash and 3D XPoint memory storage, and it also used to sell network switches, and this all made the \u201creal\u201d systems business at intel much larger. (The company still sells network adapters and DPUs.) Since 2015, we have been modeling this \u201creal\u201d datacenter business, which ascended to around $9 billion a quarter in 2019 and kissed it once again in 2021 during a hypercaler and cloud buildout before deflating down to around $5 billion a quarter now. Profits have collapsed much faster, as you can see, but are better than the minor loss Intel posted in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nThe question we have \u2013 that everyone has \u2013 is: Can Intel ever get above $5 billion a quarter again in the datacenter, and can it do so profitably? Because we like competition, we certainly hope so.\n\nSign up to our Newsletter Featuring highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to your inbox with nothing in between.\n\nSubscribe now",

            "content": "On today\u2019s Intel earnings call, we heard a bit about future products and processes at the company. 18A is still on track to ramp production in the second half of 2025, but the flagship product codenamed \u201cClearwater Forest\u201d seems to have moved. It might be the timing of milestones, but it feels like something has shifted.\n\nDid the Flagship 18A Intel Xeon Clearwater Forest Just Move?\n\nWhen we covered the first E-core Xeon launch, the Intel Xeon 6 6700E Sierra Forest three quarters ago, the Intel Xeon 6900E was clearly on the roadmap. That is the Sierra Forest-AP part that we covered in our Substack that Intel is changing its positioning on and why that is a positive tailwind for AMD. It still has customers, it is just how it is being sold will change.\n\nThe other big E-core part that we covered several times on STH last year was set to be the 2025 Clearwater Forest.\n\nWe did not just talk about it in the abstract. In August 2024, Intel said Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake Booted on Intel 18A. By September 2024, we had seen the chips and the new packaging technology.\n\nIntel was in a bit of a pickle. Sierra Forest-AP was set to launch in Q1 2025, and Clearwater Forest was targeted at Q3 2025. Then the Q4 2024 earnings call happened and we learned:\n\n\u201cWe are also making good progress on Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A server product that we plan to launch in the first half of next year.\u201d (Source: Michelle Johnston Holthaus Intel co-CEO on Intel Q4 2024 earnings call)\n\nLater in the call, MJ said that the E-core market has not materialized as fast, and that the packaging side of 18A was the reason it was moving to 2026.\n\nNow it is probably worth discussing what is a \u201claunch.\u201d Is it when there is a marketing event? Is it when parts start to ship for revenue even if they are not publicly available? Those are all valid questions and ones that apply not just to Intel but AMD and NVIDIA as well.\n\nSome Important Context\n\nI am going to give one of perhaps the most challenging takes on what is happening. There is a very real possibility I am wrong, but I wanted to layer some context here because a lot of folks covering this whiffed on the market dynamics part.\n\nIn the server market right now the macro trend is that AI servers are fairly easy to sell because there are still GPU constraints in the market. The demand is very strong. To fund that, companies are looking to web servers and relatively lower-performance machines and saying things like: \u201cI understand that I can take a 4-year old machine and consolidate 8:1 using today\u2019s new cloud-native processors, but I can also spend my budget this year on AI servers and let those servers run another year or two.\u201d\n\nThat mindset is having huge implications in the server industry. We test many servers. I can tell you that whether you pick 4:1, 6:1, 8:1, or even more, a modern cloud native processor is great for web servers and other cloud native workloads. It is clearly one of the biggest revolutions in servers we have seen in more than a decade.\n\nThe problem is: The innovation is in a space that is not receiving a lot of attention.\n\nIt impacts more than just Intel. For Ampere Computing, as an example, it is trying to sell Arm servers that are tailored for cloud native workloads, but they are facing the same challenge that spend is being allocated to GPU servers. While we have shown platforms like the 16x NVIDIA GPU 128 Core Arm Server from Supermicro and the Gigabyte Ampere Altra Max and 4x NVIDIA A100 platforms, the GPU server trend is for higher-performance per core CPUs than what we would see in the cloud-native optimized chips.\n\nI think Intel actually has a great product for the cloud-native market. Sierra Forest as a first gen design is very useful. At the same time, folks know that Clearwater Forest is going to be the big one and Sierra Forest is more of a part to satisfy some demand until the new part launches. That is why pushing a Clearwater Forest \u201cLaunch\u201d to Q1 is disappointing but it might also make sense. On the server side it does not help, but if 18A is ramping in the second quarter of this year, and there are more packaging challenges on the Clearwater Forest side, then why allocate 18A capacity to a server part in a market where buyers are consistently allocating their spend to AI servers instead? A \u201claunch\u201d of a server CPU often means that large customers already have parts it is just the mass market is getting access, so we shall see what it means in this context.\n\nFinal Words\n\nPersonally, I was looking forward to Clearwater Forest in Q3 2025, so this is a bummer. I also think the next question is that Intel has been saying its packaging proficiency would be an asset beyond just 18A so saying Clearwater Forest is now set for Q1 2026 because of packaging challenges does not sit very well. To me, the bigger challenge facing the cloud native processor folks including Intel with its E-cores is that spend on the cloud native processor segment has been re-allocated to the AI segment at a surprising rate. Between this and the changes to the go-to-market for the Intel Xeon 6900E \u201cSierra Forest-AP\u201d series, it feels like cloud native is not going to be the big 2025 push.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are building infrastructure for hosting, general VM, and so forth, Sierra Forest-SP (the Intel Xeon 6700E series) is probably doing better than many thought. AMD has Turin Dense. Ampere has its Altra Max and AmpereOne. All of thse options can offer fairly significant cloud-native consolidation today.",

            "content": "Intel on Thursday said that its codenamed Clearwater Forest processor for data centers will only be launched in the first half of 2026, roughly two years after the company introduced its Xeon 6-series CPUs and one or two quarters behind schedule. By contrast, Intel's Panther Lake product for client PCs \u2014 which uses the same 18A process technology \u2014 is on track for a 2H 2025 launch.\n\nThe delay of the key server processor comes amid the company's unveiling of Intel's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the entire year, which revealed massive losses. Paired with Intel's announced cancellation of its Falcon Shores AI GPUs, Intel's competitive posture for the exploding AI market is now severely weakened.\n\nClearwater Forest delayed\n\n\"We are also making good progress on Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A server product that we plan to launch in the first half of next year,\" said Michelle Johnston Holthaus, interim co-CEO of Intel, during the company's earnings call on Thursday. Holthaus cited difficulties with Clearwater's packaging technology but said the underlying 18A process node remains strong.\n\nCurrently, Intel is ramping up production of its energy-efficient Xeon 6 'Sierra Forest' and high-performance Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids' processors. It believes that these CPUs will be instrumental in stabilizing its market share this year. However, with the next-generation Xeon 7-series 'Clearwater Forest' and Xeon 7 'Diamond Rapids,' Intel probably expects to turn the tables and start regaining market share.\n\nHowever, there may be a setback to this plan, as Intel originally promised to launch Clearwater Forest in 2025, but it now says that the new CPUs will be released in the first half of 2026. The delay will affect Intel's competitive position in the data center market and postpone potential design wins with interested parties.\n\nClearwater Forest holds additional significance for Intel, as this is the first data center CPU with compute chiplets manufactured on the Intel 18A process technology (1.8nm-class) and featuring a Foveros 3D base die fabbed on the Intel 3 production node. If the company can mass-produce Clearwater Forest cost-effectively, it will be a major testament to its 18A manufacturing process\u2014which happens to be the first technology developed both for Intel and its foundry customers\u2014as a success. This could also attract potential clients to Intel Foundry. For now, Intel is optimistic about 18A.\n\n\"18A has been an area of good progress,\" said David Zinsner, interim co-CEO and chief financial officer of Intel, during the call. \"Like any new process, there have been ups and downs along the way, but overall, we are confident that we are delivering a competitive process.\"\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The company's revenue for 2024 totaled $53.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, which may be considered relatively flat. However, the company's net loss climbed to $18.8 billion compared to a modest $1.7 billion profit the previous year.\n\nIntel's fourth-quarter results for 2024 showed that the company earned $14.3 billion in revenue, up $1 billion from the previous quarter but down 7% from the same quarter a year ago. During Q4, the company posted a $100 million loss, whereas in Q4 2023, its profit was $2.7 billion.\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\nRevenue for Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) increased to $8 billion while generating an operating income of $3.1 billion, which is down from $8.8 billion in revenue and $3.6 billion in Q4 2023. Intel suspects that a portion of its Q4 revenue increase was due to its clients hedging against potential tariffs.\n\nIntel's Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) is less vulnerable to tariffs, so its revenue stood at $3.4 billion, up from $3.3 billion in the previous quarter but down from $3.5 billion in the same quarter a year before. However, the group's profitability hit a new low of $200 million.\n\nIntel's Networking and Edge Computing (NEX) business revenue increased to $1.6 billion, rising both sequentially and year-over-year. The unit's profitability also increased to $300 million, marking its best performance in recent quarters.\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\nIntel Foundry earned $4.5 billion in revenue and recorded a $2.3 billion loss. On an annual basis, Intel Foundry's revenue declined from $5.4 billion, while its losses widened to $2.3 billion. However, the company saw quarter-over-quarter improvement, increasing revenue from $4.4 billion and reducing losses from $5.8 billion. Intel attributes this improvement to an increased EUV wafer mix and higher equipment sales by IMS Nanofabrication. For the full year, EUV wafer revenue grew from 1% of total revenue in 2023 to over 5% in 2024.\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\nAltera delivered revenue of $429 million, up 4% sequentially, with an operating margin of 21% compared to 2% in Q3. Mobileye reported revenue of $490 million, up 1% sequentially, with an operating profit of $103 million.\n\nHumble Outlook\n\nIntel expects its revenue to be between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion for the first quarter of 2025, down $0.5 billion from Q1 2024. Also, Intel expects its GAAP gross margin to fall to 36%.",

            "content": "Intel Cancels Falcon Shores AI Chip To Focus On \u2018Rack-Scale Solution\u2019\n\nInterim Intel co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus discloses the pivot in its AI data center strategy as Nvidia forges ahead with rack-scale solutions based on the rival\u2019s Blackwell GPU architecture.\n\nIntel said it no longer plans to sell its next-generation Falcon Shores AI accelerator chip that was due later this year so that it can focus on developing a \u201csystem-level solution at rack scale\u201d with a successor chip it\u2019s calling Jaguar Shores.\n\nThe news was delivered by Michelle Johnston Holthaus, interim co-CEO and CEO of Intel Products, during the semiconductor giant\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday.\n\n[Related: Outrun By Nvidia, Intel Pitches Gaudi 3 Chips For Cost-Effective AI Systems]\n\nIntel had previously teased Falcon Shores for a late 2025 launch as the successor to Gaudi 3, the AI accelerator chip it launched last fall with OEMs such as Dell Technologies and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. But while Gaudi 3 and previous generations were application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), Falcon Shores was slated by the company as a programmable GPU that incorporated Gaudi technology.\n\nHowever, Holthaus gave a blunt assessment of Intel\u2019s AI accelerator chip strategy at an investor conference in December, saying that Gaudi will not help Intel \u201cget to the masses\u201d and suggesting that Falcon Shores wouldn\u2019t be a game-changer.\n\n\u201cMany of you heard me temper expectations on Falcon Shores last month,\u201d she said on Thursday\u2019s earnings call.\n\nNow, Holthaus said, Intel plans to use Falcon Shores for internal testing only.\n\n\u201cThis will support our efforts to develop a system-level solution at rack scale with Jaguar Shores to address the AI data center,\u201d she said. \u201cMore broadly, as I think about our AI opportunity, my focus is on the problems our customers are trying to solve, most notably lower the cost and increase the efficiency of compute.\u201d\n\nHolthaus said she arrived at the decision\u2014which she called one of her first major moves as the CEO of Intel Products and interim co-CEO after former CEO Pat Gelsinger abruptly departed in early December\u2014after receiving feedback from customers on what Intel needs to \u201cbe competitive and to deliver the right product.\u201d\n\nShe said the decision was also influenced by discussions with Intel\u2019s AI accelerator chip team on where they were \u201cfrom a competitive perspective and from an execution perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we've learned from Gaudi is it's not enough to just deliver the silicon. We need to be able to deliver a complete rack-scale solution, and that's what we're going to be able to be able to do with Jaguar Shores,\u201d Holthaus said.\n\nIntel Pivots To Where Nvidia Is Focused\n\nIntel disclosed the pivot in its AI data center strategy as Nvidia forges ahead with rack-scale solutions based on its Blackwell GPU architecture.\n\nRevealed at Nvidia\u2019s GTC event last year, the Grace Blackwell GB200 NVL72 rack-scale server platform has been pitched as the foundation for Nvidia AI offerings from major OEM and cloud computing partners, including Dell Technologies, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud.\n\nNvidia has previously said that the GB200 NVL72 platform as a \u201cmulti-node, liquid-cooled, rack-scale system for the most compute-intensive workloads,\u201d with each rack consisting of 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs connected over the NVLink chip-to-chip interconnect.\n\nIn the company\u2019s November earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the engineering does with OEM and cloud computing partners is \u201crather complicated,\u201d responding to a question about a report on Blackwell GPUs overheating in GB200 NVL72 systems.\n\n\u201cThe reason for that is because although we build full stack and full infrastructure, we disaggregate all of the AI supercomputer and we integrate it into all of the custom data centers and architectures around the world,\u201d he said at the time.\n\n\u201cThat integration process is something we\u2019ve done several generations now. We\u2019ve very good at it, but there\u2019s still a lot of engineering that happens at this point,\u201d Huang added.\n\nThe Nvidia CEO and founder was referring to the fact that the AI computing giant has been selling complete AI systems powered by its GPUs and other components for several years, with the company moving from smaller appliances to supercomputer clusters more recently.\n\nPartners Weren\u2019t Feeling High On Intel\u2019s AI Chip Strategy\n\nIntel\u2019s AI strategy pivot was made after some of the chipmaker\u2019s channel partners told CRN earlier this month that it would take the company a long time to create formidable competition to Nvidia\u2019s AI chip dominance in data centers.\n\nBefore Gelsinger abruptly retired from Intel in early December, the former CEO said during the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings call last October that it would \u201cnot achieve our target of $500 million in revenue\u201d for Gaudi chips in 2024, blaming slower-than-expected sales on the \u201cproduct transition\u201d from Gaudi 2 to Gaudi 3 as well as \u201csoftware ease of use.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia is expected to finish its 2025 fiscal year, which mostly lines up with the 2024 calendar year, with $128.6 billion in revenue, most of which is expected to come from its data center GPUs and associated systems.\n\n\u201cNvidia has got such a head start that it's just a long road,\u201d said Chris Bogan, vice president of sales at Houston-based systems integrator Mark III Systems.\n\nThe lack of Intel\u2019s leadership in AI chips for data centers led one solution provider with a U.S. presence to choose AMD and not Intel for its AI center of excellence (COE) program, according to the partner alliance manager who manages vendors for the program.\n\nAMD has made more aggressive claims against Nvidia\u2019s data center GPUs with its Instinct chips, saying in October that its forthcoming Instinct MI325X can outperform Nvidia\u2019s H200 that launched last year. The rival has also announced an accelerated road map that will see it release new GPUs every year, similar to Nvidia\u2019s revamped strategy.\n\n\u201cI don't have customers asking for [Gaudi]. What I do see is customers asking [to kick] tires on a GPU-as-a-service provider that might have AMD MI300X GPUs [or the like],\u201d said the partner alliance manager, who asked to not be identified because he was not authorized to speak on behalf of his company regarding this matter.\n\nFor Intel to gain ground in the AI chip market, the partner alliance manager said the company will need to find ways to convince partners to invest time into new products like Gaudi.\n\n\u201cIt requires extensive knowledge and training. That is literally competing with the same hours in the day that we're leveraging to actually train and build up knowledge and teams around Nvidia. So it\u2019s not just that you're competing for market share and awareness, but you're also competing for our time,\u201d he said.",

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related effects to income taxes and net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests effects. Income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate. For 2024 and 2023, we determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 13%. For 2025, we determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 12%. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on at least an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Non-GAAP adjustments attributable to non-controlling interests are calculated by adjusting for the minority stockholder portion of non-GAAP adjustments we make for relevant acquisition-related costs, share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, and income tax effects, as applicable to each majority-owned subsidiary.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\n\nNon-GAAP\n\nadjustment or\n\nmeasure Definition Usefulness to management and investors Acquisition-related adjustments Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years. We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends. Share-based compensation Share-based compensation consists of charges related to our employee equity incentive plans. We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these adjustments provide comparability to peer company results and because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core operating performance. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business model, how management currently evaluates core operational performance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends, including in comparison to other peer companies. Restructuring and other charges Restructuring charges are costs associated with a restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. 2024 mainly includes charges associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, primarily composed of cash-based employee severance and benefit arrangements, and cash and non-cash charges related to real estate exits and consolidations, as well as non-cash construction-in-progress asset impairments resulting from business exit activities. Other charges include periodic goodwill and asset impairments, and other costs associated with certain non-core activities. 2024 includes non-cash charges resulting from the impairment of goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets. 2023 includes a benefit as a result of developments in the VLSI litigation and two legal related fees, which we do not expect to recur, relating to an annulled EC-imposed fine and a termination fee relating to Tower. 2023 also includes costs associated with a formal restructuring plan approved in 2022 and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends. (Gains) losses on equity investments, net (Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists of ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable equity securities, observable price adjustments on non-marketable equity securities, related impairment charges, and the gains (losses) from the sale of equity investments and other. We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures to provide comparability between periods. The exclusion reflects how management evaluates the core operations of the business. (Gains) losses from divestiture (Gains) losses are recognized at the close of a divestiture, or over a specified deferral period when deferred consideration is received at the time of closing. Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement entered into in connection with the first closing of the sale of our NAND memory business in 2021, a portion of the initial closing consideration was deferred and will be recognized between first and second closing. We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because they do not reflect our current operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results. Interest received related to an annulled European Commission (EC) fine Interest received in 2024 related to an annulled EC-imposed fine that was paid in 2009 and refunded to us in 2022. We exclude this non-operating and non-recurring interest income for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because this adjustment facilitates comparison to past results and provides a useful evaluation of our current performance. Deferred tax assets valuation allowances A non-cash charge recorded to provision for (benefit from) income taxes related to a discreet valuation allowance recorded against our US deferred tax assets. We excluded a discrete non-cash charge in 2024 related to a valuation allowance established against our US deferred tax assets due to a historical cumulative loss for GAAP purposes. We excluded the discreet valuation allowance when calculating certain non-GAAP measures, as there is no such historical cumulative loss on a non-GAAP basis. Because of the size of the charge, the adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to our past operating results. Adjusted free cash flow We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted free cash flow, which is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow adjusted for (1) additions to property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from capital-related government incentives and net partner contributions, and (2) payments on finance leases. This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in understanding our capital requirements and sources of liquidity by providing an additional means to evaluate the cash flow trends of our business. Net capital spending We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of net capital spending, which is additions to property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from capital-related government incentives and net partner contributions.

Intel posted a loss of $100 million, or 3 cents per share, compared to a profit of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a loss of $728 million, or 14 cents per share. Intel's foundry division, which makes chips for other companies, delivered revenue of $4.5 billion, beating estimates.\n\nInterim co-CEOs Michelle Johnston Holthaus and David Zinsner said the fourth quarter showed progress in Intel\u2019s turnaround, thanks in part to efforts to cut costs.\n\nZinsner also said on the company's earnings call that \"while di\ufb03cult to quantify, we suspect a portion of Q4 revenue upside was due to customers hedging against potential tari\ufb00s.\"\n\nThe results represent Intel\u2019s first since former CEO Pat Gelsinger stepped down last month. The company has not yet named a permanent successor, raising speculation over who could take the role.\n\nThe chipmaker has also been the subject of takeover rumors recently, with Citi analysts identifying Broadcom (AVGO) as \u201cthe most likely\u201d potential buyer, adding that the rival chipmaker might sell Intel's foundry business.\n\nLooking ahead, Intel projected first-quarter revenue of $11.7 billion to $12.7 billion, below the analyst consensus of $12.9 billion. Its expected loss of 27 cents per share is also wider than the 13 cents analysts were looking for.\n\nZinsner pointed to seasonal weakness for the soft outlook, along with \"macro uncertainties, further inventory digestion and competitive dynamics.\"\n\nShares of Intel rose close to 4% in extended trading Thursday following the company's earnings call.

            "content": "During Intel\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings call, the company said that it would not bring Falcon Shores to market after all. We have been watching Intel\u2019s GPU market for some time, and Falcon Shores was supposed to be the one to get Intel back into the game. It looks like Intel is not planning to meaningfully participate in the high-end AI accelerator market in 2025.\n\nIntel Falcon Shores GPU Not Coming to Market in an AI Hit\n\nAs a bit of history, STH first showed details about Falcon Shores in 2021, Raja\u2019s Chip Notes Lay Out Intel\u2019s Path to Zettascale. Here is then Intel\u2019s accelerated computing lead, Raja Koduri\u2019s hand-written notes showing Falcon Shores in 2024-2025.\n\nFalcon had some ambitious plans. It would be a Xeon plus GPU product with Lightbender. Lightbender was Silicon Photonics in a package roughly the size and power of a HBM stack that could be used for a high-speed interconnect. From what I understand, Lightbender was cancelled some time ago.\n\nIn 2022, Falcon Shores was still being discussed as x86 and GPU IP, but with options for all GPU or all CPU with HBM.\n\nTaking a pause here, this is very similar to AMD\u2019s MI300X (all GPU), MI300C (all CPU), and MI300A (x86 plus GPU) IP. Intel even had plans for $10B of accelerator sales in 2026 which seemed like a lot in early 2022, but now it all feels like if we showed the 2022 vision for Intel accelerators, it would sound a lot more like how AMD has been executing.\n\nIn early 2023, we broke the news that Intel Announces it is 3 Years Behind AMD and NVIDIA in XPU HPC. The reason is that both AMD (Instinct APU) and NVIDIA (Grace plus GPU) both were focusing on CPU and GPU coupling, but Intel announced it would only drive Falcon Shores as a GPU. It is worth mentioning that coupling was a key enabler in Raja\u2019s chip notes in 2021. Without Falcon Shores in 2025, it feels like that statement that Intel is 3 years behind on XPUs is going to be accurate, if not falling short.\n\nOn that note, during today\u2019s earnings call, here is the statement on Falcon Shores:\n\n\u201c\u2026 on the other hand, we are not yet participating in the cloud-based AI data center market in a meaningful way. We have learned a lot as we have ramped Gaudi, and we are applying those learnings going forward. One of the immediate actions I have taken is to simplify our roadmap and concentrate our resources. Many of you heard me temper expectations on Falcon Shores last month.\n\nBased on industry feedback, we plan to leverage Falcon Shores as an internal test chip only without bringing it to market. This will support our efforts to develop a system-level solution at rack scale with Jaguar Shores to address the AI data center.\n\nMore broadly as I think about our AI data center opportunity, my focus is on the problems our customers are trying to solve. Most notably, the need to lower the cost and increase the efficiency of compute. AI is not a market in the traditional sense. It is an enabling that needs to span across the compute continuum from data center to the edge. As such, a one-sized fits all approach will not work and I can see clear opportunities to leverage our core assets in new ways to drive the most compelling total cost of ownership across the continuum.\u201d (Source: Michelle Johnston Holthaus Intel co-CEO on Intel Q4 2024 earnings call)\n\nThere is a lot there, but the narrative seems to fit. If Falcon Shores in 2021 was planned as a product that would be in the market today with AMD-like variations and silicon photonics, it would be really neat. Later in the call during Q&A MJ said that it was not enough to deliver silicon, instead it needed a rack-scale solution. I had the sense that the 2021 vision for Falcon Shores was closer to the rack-scale solution. If Intel Falcon Shores is not hitting its timeline, and companies like NVIDIA are accelerating their cycles, then passing may make sense.\n\nAt the same time, AMD is in-market with alternative GPUs in the market today, so that means that software development will naturally push to utilize AMD over Intel architectures until Intel re-enters the market. Intel had Ponte Vecchio which Stopped Hunting New Clusters three quarters ago. Intel Gaudi 3 just hit GA a few months ago, but we know that Falcon was designed to be a major architectural shift. As a result, it feels like Intel is at least pausing meaningful participation in the AI accelerator market.\n\nFinal Words\n\nLet us face it, the AI GPU market has a lot of money behind it, and Intel has thus far missed the bulk of the market. For AMD this feels like a big win since it is now the public GPU alternative to NVIDIA, and has some novel architectures. One just has to hope that the Jaguar Shores products can be pulled in by moving Falcon Shores to be an internal test chip.",

But what customers really want is that full-scale rack solution, and so we\u2019re able to get to that with Jaguar Shores.\u201d\n\nGaudi 3 is widely seen as a miss for Intel. In November, the company said it would be unable to meet its goal of $500 million in Gaudi 3 sales due to software-related issues. Today, few major service providers beyond IBM have committed to using the chip.\n\nIntel faces an uphill battle in the AI data center chip space. Rival AMD expects to make around $7 billion in AI chip revenue in 2025, while Nvidia, the incumbent to beat, could hit $195 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026, according to some analysts.\n\n\u201cAs I think about our AI opportunity, my focus is on the problems our customers are trying to solve, most notably the need to lower the cost and increase the efficiency of compute,\u201d Holthaus said. \u201cAs such, a one-size-fits-all approach will not work, and I can see clear opportunities to leverage our core assets in new ways to drive the most compelling total cost of ownership across the continuum.\u201d",

And if you thought its chipmaking foundries were spending too much back when they lost $7 billion in 2023, well, Intel just revealed the foundries lost nearly double that \u2014 $13.4 billion \u2014 across 2024.\n\nSome people would argue that foundry money is just the price Intel\u2019s paying to invest in its future, catch up to rivals, and stay the only major chipmaker that designs and fabricates its chips from scratch. And by \u201csome people,\u201d I mean it was ousted Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger\u2019s goal. But now he\u2019s gone, there have been more whispers about Intel spinning off its chipmaking businesses, something Gelsinger somewhat seeded himself.\n\nToday on the earnings call, Intel co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus didn\u2019t commit to either keeping or spinning out the foundries, but hinted that \u201cIntel Foundry will need to earn my business every day, just as I need to earn the business of my customers.\u201d Either way, she seems to see them as a pair: \u201cA stronger Intel Products combined with a more competitive Intel Foundry is a recipe for success overall.\u201d Interim co-CEO David Zinsner says building that competitive foundry is still the goal.\n\nIntel says its foundry business is doing better anyhow, with reduced losses of $2.3 billion last quarter, expected \u201cfinancial improvements\u201d coming next year as it ramps production of its extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) chips, and a plan to hit \u201cop inc break-even\u201d by the end of 2027. Intel was also the largest recipient of the CHIPS Act, though that amounted to single-digit billions worth of government funding for its foundries: $7.68 billion, of which it\u2019s received $2.2 billion so far.\n\nIntel says its all-important 18A process, which uses EUV, will produce chips in volume in the second half of next year. (That\u2019s when Panther Lake, the successor to its Lunar Lake laptop chips, will arrive.) But a follow-on chip, Nova Lake, sounds like it\u2019ll be a mix of Intel and non-Intel manufacturing. \u201cYou\u2019ll actually see compute tiles inside and outside again, it\u2019s about optimizing to what allows us to win in the market,\u201d says Holthaus on the call.\n\nIntel is also hurting in the great race for AI chips, with its Gaudi far behind Gelsinger\u2019s goals, and Holthaus admits the company\u2019s not doing well in the AI data center. \u201cI am not happy with where we are today,\u201d she said on the call, admitted that \u201cwe\u2019re not yet participating in the cloud-based AI data center market in a meaningful way.\u201d\n\nTo help speed things up, she says Intel is canceling its next big AI chip, codename Falcon Shores, and keeping it \u201cas an internal test chip only without bringing it to market.\u201d She says the plan is to \u201csimplify our roadmap and concentrate our resources.\u201d The company will focus on Jaguar Shores, a \u201csystem-level solution at rack scale,\u201d instead, with the goal of building that entire solution rather than just the chips.\n\nShe also hinted that Intel might aim to be less pricy than the Nvidia AI competition, with the \u201cmost compelling total cost of ownership,\u201d similar to what we\u2019d heard from AMD.\n\nOverall, Holthaus says she thinks about Intel\u2019s future products in \u201cthree buckets\u201d: client and edge, traditional data center, and AI data center, and she plans to simplify Intel\u2019s business as a result. \u201cWe cannot be all things to all people,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are prioritizing areas where we can drive differentiated value.\u201d Within its core businesses, though, Holthaus says the company will \u201cfight for every socket\u201d where an Intel chip can go.\n\n\u201cWe need to be aggressive, we need to win share, and we need to show our customers they can win with us,\u201d says Holthaus.\n\nOver the full year, Intel lost $18.76 billion on $53.1 billion in revenue. Intel says it has nothing new to share about the search for a permanent CEO, save that the search is progressing. Meanwhile, the company seems to be laying off just as many employees as promised: by the end of 2024, it had 15,000 fewer employees than it did the previous quarter, the company confirmed today.\n\nThis was the first Intel earnings call from Intel\u2019s new interim co-CEOs, one of whom promised at CES 2025 that the company\u2019s actually still committed to graphics, though we didn\u2019t hear much else about graphics on today\u2019s call.",

A conference call with corporate leadership will follow the earnings call and is scheduled for 5:00 p.m. EST.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s performance ahead of earnings has not been inspiring, with the stock losing nearly 5% of its value for the week as of yesterday. That follows a 3% drop last week.\n\nA broad-based sell-off in semiconductor stocks was underway after a Chinese-based artificial intelligence company released DeepSeek-R1\u2014a model that can apparently match the performance of Western AI models at a fraction of the cost while using older hardware.\n\nThe news undeniably affected Intel\u2019s stock price. However, Pat Gelsinger, the former chief executive officer of Intel, argued that \u201cthe markets are getting it wrong,\u201d referring to the expectation that DeepSeek would lead to a reduction in demand for semiconductors.\n\nOne potential upside that could come via the DeepSeek news is the need for less-advanced hardware to run models. Typically, AI models use graphic processing units (GPUs), but Intel\u2019s business focuses mostly on central processing units (CPUs). The need for fewer GPUs may benefit Intel if the prevailing narrative around DeepSeek plays out. Still, Intel has made plans to capitalize on the AI rush, although it is admittedly in a poor position to do so.\n\nInvestors may press leadership on the ramifications during the conference call. If they could lay out a solid thesis for why this is a positive development for the company, it could translate into some buying.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel earnings\u2014what do investors expect?\n\nAnalysts anticipate Intel\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) will cross the wires at $0.12 for the fourth quarter. That would be down from $0.54 reported a year ago. Revenue is expected to come in at $13.8 billion, which would compare to $15.41 billion a year ago.\n\nIn the preceding four quarters, Intel has beaten EPS and revenue estimates only two times.\n\nAnalysts are generally neutral on Intel stock, with 36 hold ratings and only three buy ratings. There are seven sell and strong sell ratings on the stock, according to TradingView. The average one-year price target stands at 23.75, representing a 20% gain over the next 12 months from yesterday\u2019s 19.84 stock price.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading Intel earnings\n\nIntel currently trades with an implied volatility rank (IVR) of 81, meaning volatility is elevated compared to the past 12 months of trading. That said, the elevated IVR makes options strategies for an earnings play potentially more attractive. The expected move for earnings based on the options market was +/- 1.8 points, or 9% of yesterday\u2019s stock price. That is on the upper range of the expected moves for companies in the S&P 500.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Westwater, a tastylive financial writer and analyst, has eight years of markets and trading experience. #@fxwestwater\n\nFor live daily programming, market news and commentary, visit tastylive or the YouTube channels tastylive (for options traders), and tastyliveTrending for stocks, futures, forex & macro.\n\nTrade with a better broker, open a tastytrade account today. tastylive Inc. and tastytrade Inc. are separate but affiliated companies.",

            "content": "Semiconductor giant Intel (INTC 0.53%) is in the middle of an existential crisis. The company lacks a permanent CEO, its foundry-centric strategy is up in the air, market share losses are stressing financials, and its artificial intelligence (AI) chip efforts have largely floundered.\n\nWhile a lot is going wrong for Intel, the server CPU business is one area where the company has made legitimate progress. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 2.30%) leapfrogged Intel a few years ago with its Genoa family of chips, trouncing the market leader in core count, performance, and efficiency. It's taken a while, but Intel finally came up with an answer last year with its Granite Rapids server CPUs.\n\nGranite Rapids is a critical product for Intel. The chip family finally moved the company's mainline server CPU products from the aging Intel 7 manufacturing process onto the more advanced Intel 3 process, a shift that brought with it significant performance and efficiency gains. Intel was able to up the maximum core count to 128, doubling the core count of its predecessor, and reviews indicated that Intel had largely caught up with AMD in terms of performance.\n\nA surprise price cut\n\nOne somewhat surprising thing about the Granite Rapids launch was the pricing. Intel decided to go big, setting the pricing for the flagship model at the highest level ever for an x86 server CPU. Given that Intel was still playing catch-up, this pricing decision was either a sign that Intel was extremely confident in Granite Rapids, or an indication that the company hasn't accepted that the competitive landscape is very different today than it was a few years ago.\n\nTom's Hardware reported earlier this week that Intel had drastically slashed the listed prices for Granite Rapids CPUs without any formal announcement. The flagship model is now listed at $12,460, a full $5,340 less than the original launch price. Other models received price cuts as well, bringing pricing below comparable AMD alternatives.\n\nNotably, the price cut has brought the price per core on the highest-end Granite Rapids chips far below AMD's top-tier chips, making Granite Rapids an attractive proposition for customers building out densely packed cloud data centers.\n\nThere are a few ways to interpret this price cut. First, Granite Rapids may not be selling as well as Intel had hoped. While the product family looks like a winner, the pricing was elevated and could have driven customers away. Intel is set to report its quarterly results on Thursday, so hopefully the company will provide an update.\n\nThe second way to interpret this move is that Intel is taking aggressive steps to win back market share. The company is still the leader in the server CPU market, but AMD has made enormous gains over the past few years. AMD's x86 server unit share stood at 24.2% in the third quarter of 2024, up from just 6.6% in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nThe truth may be a combination of the two. Slashing prices could hurt Intel's margins, but that's not a foregone conclusion. Because Intel manufactures Granite Rapids in-house on its Intel 3 process, if the price cut boosts unit sales and improves utilization rates in the company's fabs, profit margins may not take that big of a hit. Intel 3 is a process that Intel offers to foundry customers, and it's possible that the company has excess capacity that it needs to fill.\n\nBlunting AMD's momentum\n\nNo matter the reason for the price cut, Intel's latest server CPUs are now far more attractive compared to AMD's. AMD outsources manufacturing to TSMC, so if the company were to cut prices in response, it would eat into its profit margins.\n\nOne thing to remember, though, is that the list prices for Intel and AMD server CPUs are not what large customers are actually paying. Rather, they're a ceiling. Intel may have been giving large discounts to cloud computing customers all along.\n\nRegardless, it looks like Intel is taking off the gloves as it tries to get its data center business back into shape and win back some of the market share it's lost over the past few years. With a solid and competitive product lineup, aggressive pricing could be just what the company needs to turn things around.",

It was a slower quarter for the company, with a significant miss of analysts\u2019 adjusted operating income and EPS estimates.\n\nIs Intel a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Intel\u2019s revenue to decline 10.4% year on year to $13.8 billion, a reversal from the 9.7% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.12 per share.\n\nIntel Total Revenue\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Intel has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates three times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Intel\u2019s peers in the semiconductors segment, some have already reported their Q4 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Qorvo\u2019s revenues decreased 14.7% year on year, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 1.4%, and Texas Instruments reported a revenue decline of 1.7%, topping estimates by 3.3%. Texas Instruments traded down 7.5% following the results.\n\nRead our full analysis of Qorvo\u2019s results here and Texas Instruments\u2019s results here.\n\nInvestors in the semiconductors segment have had steady hands going into earnings, with share prices up 1.3% on average over the last month. Intel\u2019s stock price was unchanged during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $23.83 (compared to the current share price of $19.96).\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

This resulted in Intel moving Mark III coverage responsibilities to a sales representative at TD Synnex, which, like other distributors, receives funds from the semiconductor giant to provide Intel-related resources to the broad channel.\n\nHowever, the sales executive called the change a \u201cnon-event,\u201d saying Mark III \u201cdidn\u2019t really lose anything\u201d from a \u201cfunctionality perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to get competitive investment funds where we need to. It\u2019s always nice to have an Intel person, but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve seen anything that's been concerning or like, \u2018Hey, we've lost support that we used to have and it's costing us business with Intel,\u2019\u201d Bogan said.\n\nKent Tibbils, vice president of marketing at Fremont, Calif.-based distributor ASI, said he sees the push for distributors to cover more of Intel\u2019s channel partners as a \u201cgood opportunity\u201d for such companies to \u201cshowcase our value and what makes us unique amongst each other to help support [them].\u201d\n\nDistributors like ASI can help partners with Intel-related matters ranging from product road maps and value proposition initiatives to inventory management and forecasting, according to the distribution executive.\n\n\u201cIntel understands, \u2018We have a valuable channel. We have a valuable infrastructure here that we\u2019ve done a great job enabling and supporting, and we have [it] in place for a reason, and that\u2019s to be able to reach this breadth of customers and support the resellers and accounts that we can't necessarily reach,\u2019\u201d Tibbils said.\n\nPartners Encouraged By Program Changes, AI ISV Focus\n\nTibbils said he found the Intel program changes outlined by Guzzi \u201cvery encouraging.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly Intel values that infrastructure that they've created and that logistical supply chain they've created, and they want to keep that in place, and they understand the value that each level of partner can provide, especially distributors,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for Intel\u2019s plan to require partners to achieve certain outcomes like customer lead generation to receive market development funds, Tibbils said this kind of outcome-based model isn\u2019t new for distributors and it should help solution providers deliver better results.\n\n\u201cIt really puts a better bullseye on how those funds are going to be used,\u201d he said.\n\nMultiple channel partners who spoke with CRN concurred with Tibbils and said Intel\u2019s new outcome-based MDF model falls in line with what other major vendors are doing.\n\n\u201cHaving this be outcome-based is a great move. They shouldn\u2019t be spending their money on companies that just check the box,\u201d said Christopher Cyr, CTO at North Sioux City, S.D.-based Sterling, which is No. 54 on CRN\u2019s 2024 Solution Provider 500 list.\n\nThe move by Intel to focus on AI ISVs was celebrated by multiple partners, including Mike Trojecki, senior director of AI practice at St. Louis, Mo.-based systems integrator World Wide Technology, No. 7 on CRN\u2019s 2024 Solution Provider 500.\n\n\u201cIf they're saying they're focusing on the AI side of the house from an ISV standpoint, that's exciting for us, because that's a key growth area for us,\u201d said the WWT employee, who added that \u201csome of these ISVs [will] be a critical part of the solutions we offer.\u201d\n\nOne good example of the kind of work Intel does with ISVs is WaitTime, which has optimized its crowd intelligence software for Intel CPUs, according to Trojecki.\n\n\u201cThey've done really well in that environment,\u201d he said.\n\nTrojecki also complimented the support Intel provides larger partners like WWT while acknowledging the reduction in direct coverage for other partners.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Intel is focusing on some of the larger partners is a really good thing for us now. I feel bad for some of the smaller partners that are not going to get the love and attention, but the distributors do a good job,\u201d he said.\n\nAn executive at a national systems integrator said he is glad to see Intel increase partner funding because he has witnessed firsthand AMD\u2019s growing influence in the channel.\n\nThe executive, who asked not to be named to speak frankly, recalled telling an Intel channel executive months ago, \u201cAMD is paying significantly to basically gain influence with our sales teams, and you guys just don't want to do anything. So I don't know what else to tell you, either match it or don't, but that\u2019s how this is going.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just waking up to the fact that \u2018AMD\u2019s starting to eat at us, and it is working,\u2019\u201d the systems integrator executive said.\n\nPartners Concerned About Intel\u2019s Nvidia Rivalry\n\nWhile partners said they want to see Intel rise above the challenges it has faced in recent years, they think it will take a long time for the semiconductor giant to create formidable competition to Nvidia\u2019s AI chip dominance in data centers.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake for these partners and Intel is how much money they\u2019re able to make together because Nvidia\u2019s data center GPUs and GPU-accelerated servers carry much higher average selling prices than data center CPUs and standard servers, respectively.\n\nNvidia is also capturing a higher percentage of data center spending by selling its own servers and designing several other server components, like motherboards and data processing units. Commercial software is becoming a big business for Nvidia too.\n\nBogan, the sales executive at Mark III, said Nvidia is a \u201chuge part\u201d of his company\u2019s business, which has resulted in the solution provider being named a top Nvidia partner for multiple years.\n\nFor Intel to compete against Nvidia\u2019s AI computing business, which spans from GPUs and CPUs to entire systems and software, the sales executive said it\u2019s \u201csuch a heavy left.\u201d\n\nThis effort has been mainly happening through Intel\u2019s Gaudi accelerator chips. Intel said last September that its latest, Gaudi 3, has a \u201cprice performance advantage\u201d against Nvidia\u2019s two-year-old H100 GPU while admitting the chip isn\u2019t as fast. And last month, interim Intel co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus admitted that Gaudi 3\u2019s successor, due by late 2025, won\u2019t be \u201cfantastic\u201d but will serve as a \u201cgood first step.\u201d\n\n\u201cNvidia has got such a head start that it's just a long road,\u201d Bogan said.\n\nThe lack of Intel\u2019s leadership in AI chips for data centers led one solution provider with a U.S. presence to choose AMD and not Intel for its AI center of excellence (COE) program, according to the partner alliance manager who manages vendors for the program.\n\nAMD has made more aggressive claims against Nvidia\u2019s data center GPUs with its Instinct chips, saying in October that its forthcoming Instinct MI325X can outperform Nvidia\u2019s H200 that launched last year. The rival has also announced an accelerated road map that will see it release new GPUs every year, similar to Nvidia\u2019s revamped strategy.\n\n\u201cI don't have customers asking for [Gaudi]. What I do see is customers asking [to kick] tires on a GPU-as-a-service provider that might have AMD MI300X GPUs [or the like],\u201d said the partner alliance manager, who asked to not be identified because he was not authorized to speak on behalf of his company regarding this matter.\n\nThe solution provider employee said his company\u2019s decision to not invest in Intel for its AI COE program doesn\u2019t reflect its broader partnership with the chipmaker, which has allowed his company to drive many CPU sales for Intel.\n\nBut for Intel to gain ground in the AI chip market, the partner alliance manager said the company will need to find ways to convince partners to invest time into new products like Gaudi.\n\n\u201cIt requires extensive knowledge and training. That is literally competing with the same hours in the day that we're leveraging to actually train and build up knowledge and teams around Nvidia. So it\u2019s not just that you're competing for market share and awareness, but you're also competing for our time,\u201d he said.\n\nIntel\u2019s Uncertain Future Weighs On Partners\n\nBesides concerns about Intel\u2019s ability to compete with Nvidia in the broader AI chip market, a few partners also said they were concerned about the chipmaker\u2019s future after it faced some of its largest challenges last year, which included the abrupt departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger.\n\n\u201cIt's hard to see their vision\u2014even from the inside\u2014and this is not probably the time to struggle with that,\u201d said the unnamed partner alliance manager.\n\nThe solution provider employee said he doesn\u2019t see this issue with AMD and Nvidia, whose strategies are made clear by their respective leaders, Lisa Su and Jensen Huang.\n\n\u201cYou know exactly where they're headed and how they plan to get there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn't sound like much, but it allows everyone to move in the same direction.\u201d\n\nWhile interim Intel co-CEO David Zinsner said last month the company\u2019s \u201ccore strategy remains intact,\u201d the company will put an extra emphasis on the products group and push for a quicker return on investment for its manufacturing business, Intel Foundry.\n\nHowever, the executive added that the possibility of the chipmaker separating Intel Foundry from Intel Products is an \u201copen question for another day.\u201d\n\nTrojecki of WWT said this question has left him wondering about Intel\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cI'm more worried about where Intel is going from an overall business standpoint. I think [Holthaus, who is also CEO of Intel Products] is going to do great on the product side, but what they do on the foundry side is going to be really interesting,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "When Apple began to build its own processors for iPhones and iPads in 2009 \u2013 2010, it initially used Samsung Foundry, but after custom silicon became a key advantage of iPhones over rivals in the early 2010s, the company began to explore other makers as Samsung was Apple's primary rival at the time. The company considered using Intel Custom Foundry (ICF) and Texas Instruments but quickly realized the ICF was not tailored for external customers at all, while TI did not have advanced process technologies. As a result, it chose TSMC as its exclusive supplier, according to Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, who spoke to Acquired.\n\n\"The [CEO] of Intel has approached Tim Cook and has asked Tim Cook to consider Intel, and at this time, Intel was the major supplier for Apple's Mac line,\" Chang reminisced. \"I knew a lot of Intel's customer customers in Taiwan [\u2026] none of them liked Intel [as it] always acted like they were the the only guy [with] microprocessors. [\u2026] The Foundry business where TSMC [\u2026] does not compete with customers and even if Intel is trying to do business in good faith they do have the conflict [of interests.\"\n\nWhen Intel's CEO Paul Otellini approached Tim Cook in early 2011, offering to manufacture Apple's chips, Apple paused discussions with TSMC for two months to evaluate the proposal.\n\nMorris Chang, concerned about this pause, traveled to Apple's headquarters to check on the situation. In a private meeting, Tim Cook reassured Chang that Apple would not choose Intel.\n\n\"Intel just does not know how to be a foundry,\" Tim Cook reportedly told Chang.\n\nThe implication was that Intel lacked the customer-centric mindset required for a foundry business. Unlike TSMC, which tailors its process technologies to meet customer needs, Intel was used to designing and producing its own chips and struggled to adapt to servicing external clients. By contrast, Apple valued TSMC's ability to listen and respond to specific demands, something Intel historically did not do.\n\n\"When the customer asks a lot of things, we have learned to respond to every request,\" Chang said. \"Some of them were crazy, some of them were irrational, [but] we respond to each request courteously. [\u2026] Intel has never done that, I knew a lot of customers of Intel's here in Taiwan and all [of them] wished that there were another supplier.\"\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

TSMC planned to move from 28nm planar to 16nm FinFET, but Apple wanted a custom 20nm-class planar node instead. At the time, TSMC did not have enough R&D teams to develop two process technologies at once, so the company had to divert people working on CLN16FF to CLN20SOC to meet Apple's needs in 2014.\n\nAlthough Apple dual-sourced its A8 and A9 processors at 20nm and 16nm-class process technologies from Samsung and TSMC, Apple eventually committed to TSMC for all future processors. The Apple Silicon strategy cemented TSMC's position as the exclusive supplier, as the company's system-on-chips for different applications share quite a lot of IP.\n\nThe decision to meet Apple's demands was critical in TSMC surpassing Intel as the world's most advanced semiconductor manufacturer. Apple's business gave TSMC predictable high-volume orders, helping justify massive CapEx and R&D investments. As a result, TSMC has consistently outpaced Intel by introducing leading-edge nodes.",

But are they the cheapo RTX 4070 killers we're all gagging for? Now that's the question.\n\nX user Tomasz Gawro\u0144ski (via ye olde Videocardz) spotted a trio of purportedly new E21x device IDs to supplement existing E20x Battlemage IDs associated with the Arc B570 and B580 cards. It's speculated these new cards could be based on a different GPU die altogether.\n\nIntel added 3 new battlemage IDNew battlemage gpu incoming ? pic.twitter.com/dLNfGHQgIdJanuary 28, 2025\n\nThe Intel Arc B570 and B580 use the G21 die. However, a larger, more powerful G31 Battlemage die has been rumoured for what seems like eons. In this scenario, the new IDs could cover off B750 and B770 cards based on the G31, and maybe a low-end B380 board.\n\nThe rumoured G31 chip is said to have 32 execution units or EUs. That compares with the 20 EUs of the B580. In other words, a graphics card based on G31 would be in the order of 50% more powerful than the B580.\n\nIf you're generous about scaling and driver quality, that could put it well into RTX 4070 territory. Indeed, given the modest on-paper improvements promised by Nvidia for the 5070, that could put a G31-based Intel Arc card into direct competition with the RTX 5070. Wouldn't that be nice?\n\nIt certainly would if the G31 GPU exists, if Intel has got its drivers working and if it prices the thing right. Those are, of course, quite a lot of stars to align.\n\nIt's also worth noting that some as yet unlaunched Arc cards, based on the existing G21 chip, but packing 24GB of memory in a clamshell arrangement, have also been spotted in shipping manifests. So, it's quite possible those Linux device IDs refer to, for instance, a pair of new G21-based Intel Arc Pro cards, plus maybe that low-end B380 board.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

In the last reported quarter, the company\u2019s earnings surprise was negative 1,433.3%.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Intel for the fourth quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\n\n\nIntel currently has an ESP of 0.00% with a Zacks Rank #3.\n\n\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors Shaping the Upcoming Results\n\nDuring the quarter, Intel collaborated with EQTY Lab and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to launch the Verifiable Compute AI (artificial intelligence) framework to govern and audit AI workflows. This hardware-based solution helps to ensure that AI is accountable and secure at runtime, offering consumers and businesses added confidence to accelerate AI adoption and development.\n\n\n\nIntel also extended its collaboration with Karma Automotive to showcase the power of their jointly developed Software Defined Vehicle Architecture (SDVA) solution. This solution aims to redefine the automotive industry by creating intelligent, efficient and sustainable vehicles by leveraging Intel's expertise in computing and software technology. These are likely to have generated incremental revenues in the quarter.\n\n\n\nHowever, Intel lagged NVIDIA on the innovation front with the latter\u2019s H100 and Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) being runaway success. An accelerated ramp-up of AI PCs is likely to have affected the short-term margins of Intel as it shifted production to its high-volume facility in Ireland, where wafer costs are typically higher. Margins are also likely to have been adversely impacted by higher charges related to non-core businesses, charges associated with unused capacity and an unfavorable product mix. Consequently, Intel restructured its top management in the quarter to fuel its growth engine.\n\n\n\nMoreover, China's purported move to replace U.S.-made chips with domestic alternatives could significantly affect Intel as it derives a significant portion of its revenues from the communist nation. The recent directive to phase out foreign chips from key telecom networks by 2027 underscores Beijing's accelerating efforts to reduce reliance on Western technology amid escalating U.S.-China tensions. As Washington tightens restrictions on high-tech exports to China, Beijing has intensified its push for self-sufficiency in critical industries. This shift poses a dual challenge for Intel, as it faces potential market restrictions and increased competition from domestic chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and NVIDIA. These are likely to have adversely impacted its bottom line in the quarter.",

            "content": "DeepSeek, a China-based startup, unveiled an AI assistant last week that is 20 to 50 times cheaper to train and operate than OpenAI's models. This triggered a massive selloff of tech stocks that had been driven by the rise of AI. The selloff wiped nearly $600 billion from Nvidia\u2019s market value as investors believed that demand for its processors would decrease. However, ex-Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger argues that compute performance is never enough and that high demand for processors from tech giants will remain.\n\n\n\nThe reaction to DeepSeek's breakthrough has overlooked three critical lessons from five decades of computing, according to Gelsinger's post over at LinkedIn. First, lowering the cost of computing resources expands the market, not contracts it. Just as cheaper technologies like PCs and mobile devices drove explosive growth, making AI more affordable will integrate it into more applications and will trigger broader adoption.\n\n\n\n\"The market reaction is wrong, lowering the cost of AI will expand the market,\" Gelsinger wrote. \"Today I am an Nvidia and AI stock buyer and happy to benefit from lower prices.\"\n\nThe market reaction is wrong ex-Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger\n\nSecond, engineering thrives under constraints, Gelsinger notes. DeepSeek\u2019s team faced export restrictions and limited resources but created a world-class solution at a fraction of the usual cost. This ingenuity resonates with insights from computer science pioneers, who often state that they achieved their best work under significant limitations.\n\n\n\nThird, openness fosters innovation, Gelsinger contends. The shift toward proprietary AI models stifles transparency and collaboration. Open ecosystems, as proven by Linux, Wi-Fi, and USB, consistently lead to better outcomes by encouraging scrutiny, ethical introspection, and broader adoption. DeepSeek\u2019s open approach offers a much-needed reminder of the importance of shared innovation in AI.\n\n\n\n\u201cOpen wins every time it is given a proper shot,\u201d Gelsinger wrote. \u201cAI is much too important for our future to allow a closed ecosystem to ever emerge as the one and only in this space.\u201d\n\n\n\nGelsinger is not alone in his assessment that the market reaction is wrong; other market observers believe that the reaction was exaggerated. AMD, Broadcom, Intel, and Nvidia remain essential for building AI data centers and training large AI models.\n\n\n\n\"The real money in AI is providing the chips for the data centers from the likes of Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom,\" Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, told Reuters. \"Overall, I view the AI tech selloff today as an opportunity to add high-quality tech shares on weakness.\"\n\n\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s model can be used locally on PCs and even smartphones, which is its fundamental advantage over ChatGPT's o1 and o4 models that reside on the cloud. However, training the model still requires advanced data center-grade hardware. Although DeepSeek reduces requirements for training hardware, companies like Anthropic and OpenAI could increase the number of parameters for their models while still consuming their vast computing resources.\n\n\n\nTo that end, demand for advanced processors in large-scale computing environments is expected to persist. Also, it is unclear how much resources \u2014 both computational and financial \u2014 DeepSeek consumed while prepping to train its model and developing all the optimizations to reduce requirements for the training cluster. Thus, the implications of DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough on the hardware market remain to be determined.\n\n\n\nAs a result, experts suggest that the selloff could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors in tech stocks like AMD, Broadcom, Intel, and Nvidia.",

While the revelation of DeepSeek\u2019s R1 artificial intelligence (AI) cut a swath through the market, one unexpected winner was Apple (AAPL). But as it turns out, there may be another such winner: chip stock Intel (INTC) may also benefit from DeepSeek. Investors were skeptical, though, as they sent shares down nearly 2% in Tuesday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nSo how does Intel come out ahead as a result of DeepSink? The idea is surprisingly simple; DeepSink represents a potential for new, \u201cresource-light\u201d model AI to make an appearance in the field. That in turn will likely put a crimp in the demand for AI hardware, since it simply won\u2019t be necessary.

General purpose computing tools are Intel\u2019s bread and butter core holdings, so that opens up a fresh market. And with Intel delivering new and improved options on that front, AI that works with the basics, plus Intel\u2019s proficiency with the basics, could add up to a win.\n\nThanks! Pat Gelsinger\n\nAnd then, in perhaps an even more unexpected twist, former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger himself reached out to the DeepSeek team to offer up his personal thanks for their work. Gelsinger, on X\u2014formerly Twitter\u2014noted that \u201cWisdom is learning the lessons we thought we already knew,\u201d and that DeepSeek\u2019s work brought to mind \u201c\u2026three important learnings from computing history.\u201d\n\nThe lessons in question: lower costs mean higher adoption rates, limited resources mean more ingenuity, and the concept of \u201copen wins.\u201d All \u201copen wins\u201d really means is that open source alternatives tend to see more development, because they are more accessible, and thus, more likely to spawn those innovations that carry the field forward.\n\nIs Intel a Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock based on one Buy, 23 Holds and four Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 53.95% loss in its share price over the past year, the average INTC price target of $23.58 per share implies 18.4% upside potential.\n\nSee more INTC analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

It will initially focus on finding drugs to treat breast cancer, prostate cancer and lymphoma.\n\n\u201cLike many of you, we\u2019ve both had people close to us affected by cancer and other diseases,\u201d Hoffman and Mukherjee wrote in a Monday blog post. \u201cWhen we first discussed creating Manas, we shared a vision of a future where breakthrough treatments don\u2019t take decades to develop.\u201d\n\nManas AI hopes to shrink the drug discovery process from a decade to a few years by combining what it called human and synthetic intelligence, or researchers and AI. Together, they can explore chemical spaces and analyze molecular interactions 100 times faster than traditional methods, per the post.\n\nThe startup\u2019s Project Cosmos aims to map the fundamental rules of drug binding, further speeding up drug discovery, the post said.\n\nManas AI is launching with $24.6 million in seed funding, led by General Catalyst with participation from Greylock Partners, where Hoffman is a partner, and other strategic investors. The funding will be used to scale the company\u2019s AI platform, advance its drug candidate pipeline and expand its global clinical programs.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform will provide computing for the AI startup.\n\nIntel Invests in Chiplet AI Startup Baya Systems\n\nChip startup Baya Systems raised more than $36 million in a Series B round, which it will use for operational growth and to develop its system-on-chip (SoC) designs for chiplets, according to a Jan. 23 press release.\n\nAdvancements in computing are changing how SoCs are designed to meet the growing demand for AI, efficient data processing and higher computational power. Traditional SoCs are becoming harder and more expensive to improve, so the industry is adopting a new SoC model that combines multiple smaller chips called chiplets. This configuration offers better performance, lower power usage and reduced costs.\n\nThe Series B was led by Maverick Silicon and backed by a strategic investment from Synopsys. Current investors Matrix Partners and Intel Capital reinvested in the company.\n\nJim Keller serves as the company\u2019s chairman of the board. He worked at Apple, playing a key role in designing its A4 and A5 chips that powered early iPhones and iPads. He also led the development of Tesla\u2019s autopilot chips. He was the lead architect for AMD\u2019s Athlon K7 chip and its K8 microarchitecture, ushering in advances in computer power and efficiency.\n\nElevenLabs Raises $250 Million at $3 Billion Valuation\n\nAI synthetic voice creator ElevenLabs raised $250 million in a Series C funding round, valuing the company at $3 billion to $3.3 billion, TechCrunch reported Jan. 24. Iconiq Growth led the round.\n\nElevenLabs is known for its voice cloning. Its AI can take 30 minutes of high-quality audio to create a professional-sounding voice. The company has struck deals with the estates of Burt Reynolds, Judy Garland, James Dean and Sir Laurence Olivier to get rights to their voices. Using ElevenLabs\u2019 Reader app, readers can listen to eBooks from a choice of celebrity voices.\n\nThe Series C came a year after ElevenLabs\u2019 $80 million Series B round that valued the company at more than $1 billion.\n\nAI Video Maker Synthesia Raises $180 Million\n\nSynthesia, which uses AI to create videos without cameras, actors or a studio, raised $180 million in a Series D funding round, according to a blog post.\n\nIt will use the capital to further enhance its platform for creating, collaborating and publishing AI videos, per the post. Users can input text to generate a video, choose an AI avatar that speaks any of 120 languages to appear in it, and customize the video with logos and backgrounds.\n\nCorporate clients use these videos for employee training \u2014 rather than making them read text \u2014 to announce new policies and enliven PowerPoint slides, among other uses. Customers include Heineken, Zoom and Reuters.\n\nNew investors in the Series D \u2014 NEA, Atlassian Ventures, World Innovation Lab and PSP Growth \u2014 joined existing investors GV, FirstMark, Accel, Kleiner Perkins, MMC and others, per the post.\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

            "content": "Recently, Intel researchers published a blog post that points to a more modular and sustainable future for laptops and mini PCs.\n\nThe blog, envisions concepts for laptops that feature standardized motherboards and IO ports for a variety of laptop types including fan-less, single-fan and dual-fan versions.\n\nPart of the argument from the researchers \u2014 Roberta Zouain, Intel's Sustainability Product Strategy and Marketing Manager; Reshma PP, Director of System Design; and Gurpreet Sandhu, Vice President of the Platform Engineering Group \u2014 is to reduce e-waste, which they say generates over 60 million tons on a yearly basis, with less than 25% of that actually collected for recycling.\n\nThe drive for sustainable PC design appears to partner with the right to repair movement. This movement argues that people should be able to repair or upgrade their devices without being penalized for not buying the latest gear or restricted from accessing components and tools to do so.\n\nThere are some modular laptop designs already in the wild. Framework has been making customizable gaming PCs for awhile. Asus announced at CES the ROG Strix Scar 16 and 18 which features tooless upgrades for the SSD, no screwdriver required.\n\nWhat Intel is arguing for is more open source and standardized from the factory floor to repair shops and the home user. This would mean that anyone could find components and tools to repair or upgrade their laptop.\n\nHow does Intel's proposal work?\n\nOne big change proposed by Intel is a standardized motherboard that is designed into three segments with the motherboard and system-on-a-chip separated from the IO ports.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

These changes include removable CPU and GPU chips, hot-swappable storage and even repairable Thunderbolt modules.\n\n\"These modules significantly reduce repair costs and simplify the repair process in the event of port or connector damage at the end-user level,\" they write.\n\nOne thing that would need to be fought against here is how components are installed. In a right to repair favored world, any component from the display to a random USB port could be replaced with new components that plug or screw in.\n\nUnfortunately, in some devices (looking at you Apple), components are glued in and nearly impossible to remove without some serious know-how or technical support.\n\nIn a race to have the thinnest laptops in the world (outside of the gaming market), I wonder if modular PCs would make sleek laptops a thing of the past. Personally, I would take a chunkier device over a thin laptop if I could easily swap out my RAM or put in the latest CPU to get the most of out my PC without buying a new hunk of plastic.\n\nWhen could we see this future?\n\nUnfortunately, probably not for a while. Unless Intel is heavily working on this in the background, the blog is a proposal and Intel doesn't make laptops or mini PCs.\n\nInstead, it would need to be adapted in agreements with Intel partners like Dell or Asus.\n\nAssuming Intel is working on this, we would guess the earliest you would actually see modular PCs would be a year, but that may be wishful thinking.",

            "content": "Anyway, let\u2019s get into the B570 review.\n\nIntel Arc B570 Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out our B580 review if you want more detail on frametime pacing and on the basics of the architecture. For a quick recap of the specs:\n\nThe B580 GPU is a 20 Xe-core configuration on 5 render slices, a 190W TBP, and 12GB of GDDR6. Memory bandwidth is relatively high for a card of this class, at 456 GB/s. The B570 card drops 2 of the Xe cores to land at 18 and is still set up on 5 render slices. RT units get cut down as well, TBP is at 150W, and memory is set up at 10GB of GDDR6 with a 380GB/s bandwidth. The memory interface is a smaller 160 bits.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick pricing recap:\n\nAt the time of writing this ahead of launch, we checked Newegg and Amazon for several GPUs.\n\nThe Intel B580 GPU is mostly out of stock at the actual MSRP and being scalped at the time we\u2019re writing this. On Newegg, it\u2019s $340 and up right now, which is far too much to pay. It\u2019s likely that when this story is published, the retailers will restock with B580s that are closer to normal, but we can\u2019t review the future.\n\nThe RTX 4060 is currently around $295 to $320, with units regularly available at $300.\n\nThe AMD RX 7600 is $250 as of writing this, making it the closest price competition on a relatively modern architecture.\n\nEnough of that. We have a lot of charts to get through today, so let\u2019s start with the alternative CPU testing.\n\nWe are going to present charts that have 3 CPUs per card on them. The way to use these is not to compare the GPUs to each other, but rather to compare the same GPU against itself across 3 CPUs. This is to test whether Arc is disproportionately impacted by lower-end CPUs, meaning to test whether relative percent scaling against its competition worsens on a more likely pairing of a lower-end CPU.\n\nWe locked the 5600X to its single-core frequency except across all cores for one set of tests, then we used a 12400 for the other set.\n\nThe current topic, at least as we\u2019ve seen it mostly discussed in comments, is that Intel may be disproportionately hurt by driver overhead. Our testing is done with the intent to create a GPU bottleneck, as this isn\u2019t a CPU review, and our content is done with maximum controls with the intent that you\u2019d check both the CPU and GPU review. In this instance, we are still enacting controls, but potentially using a lower-end CPU. We kept our game settings the same, though, which means that even 1080p will often be GPU bottlenecked.\n\nIntel Arc B570 Bounded Benchmarks\n\nFFXIV - 1080p\n\nThis chart is for Final Fantasy 14 at 1080p.\n\nWe\u2019ll look at all of the B580 rows first:\n\nWith a 9800X3D, the B580 ran at 124 FPS AVG\n\nWith a 5600X and a fixed all-core frequency, it was at 122 FPS AVG\n\nWith the 12400, it was at 120 FPS AVG\n\nThere is no substantial change to the B580\u2019s performance across these three CPUs with this test configuration.\n\nMoving to the RTX 4060: The 4060 on the 9800X3D bench, 5600X bench, and 12400 bench performed identically. It was about 112-114 FPS AVG on all of them. There is no substantial change to performance.\n\nThe RX 7600 saw a performance drop on the i5-12400, but on the other two systems, was about the same.\n\nWith the B570, we observed approximately equivalent performance from the 12400, 5600X, and the 9800X3D (read our review). As such, the percent difference between all of these devices is overall comparable in this test, despite which CPU is used.\n\nAcross all tested devices, we did observe a reduction in 0.1% low performance as the CPU was reduced to lower performance levels. As an example, the RX 7600 with the 9800X3D, at 84 FPS 0.1%, versus with the 5600X at 62.1. This is expected.\n\nFFXIV - 1440p\n\nHere\u2019s the test at 1440p. In this benchmark, we did not observe a meaningful difference in B580 performance across the 3 CPUs. The same is true for the RTX 4060 and the RX 7600. We are not able to detect any differences beyond slight variance across platforms. The B570 also does not scale differently and scores almost identically across the three platforms. The data consistency for average FPS is actually remarkable. This means that the unbound data later will be sufficient for establishing differences between averages.\n\nAs for lows, we are seeing consistently reduced lows on the lower-end CPUs in this game. The 5600X and 12400 both had worse 0.1% lows than the 9800X3D with the B570. With the RTX 4060, we\u2019re seeing stable 0.1% lows across all 3 devices. With the RX 7700 XT (watch our review), we saw differing lows between the 9800X3D and 12400. With the RX 7600, we saw stable lows across all 3.\n\nIt would appear that, based on the B580, B570, and A770 (read our revisit) data, there may be an argument to worse lows on lower-end CPUs for Arc. We\u2019ll need more games.\n\nFFXIV - 4K\n\nAt 4K, everything is remarkably consistent. This mostly includes lows as well, although exceptions like the 9800X3D and 5600X for the A770 apply.\n\nBroadly speaking, the GPUs are about the same here across all configurations here.\n\nCyberpunk - 1080p\n\nThis is Cyberpunk at 1080p/Ultra. We\u2019ll go through it fast: The results do not change CPU-to-CPU. The only differences are on the RTX 4060, where we see worse lows on the lower-end CPUs, the A770, where we see a very slightly lower average, and the 7700 XT, where we see a change in 0.1% lows. The B580 and B570 do not exhibit a change. In fact, realistically, the CPU change does not affect any of these results with regard to how we do a standard review. They are the same. This is GPU-bound, so that\u2019s what you\u2019d expect. Some of the internet has lost the plot and think \u201cArc bad at 1080p,\u201d but it\u2019s not that simple. It depends on the GPU load and the game.\n\nStarfield - 1080p\n\nStarfield is known to be problematic for Arc. We have that discussion in the standalone chart, but we\u2019ll focus only on scaling within a given card here. We did not observe a difference in the relative ranking of the B580 or B570 versus their competition in this test. Relative percent scaling did not get worse with lower-end CPUs.\n\nAt 1080p, there is a slight difference at the top-end with the 7700 XT and the 12400 as a potential CPU bind comes into play.\n\nThe RTX 4060 is identical in AVG FPS performance across all 3 CPUs; however, we observed worse frametime pacing on the 5600X and 12400 for the RTX 4060. Ultimately, they are the same level of reduction from the 9800X3D, so the two lower-end CPUs are comparable to each other.\n\nThe RX 7600 is identical in AVG FPS performance and within variance on all 3. Again, the 9800X3D has a slight advantage in frametime pacing.\n\nThe B580 is identical on all 3 for AVG FPS. There is also no meaningful difference in frametime pacing or 0.1% low performance. Note though that the B580 has some troublesome lows in this title already, but they don\u2019t get worse on lower-end CPUs.\n\nThe B570 is the same and the results are within variance for all 3 metrics.\n\nResident Evil 4 - 1080p\n\nThis is Resident Evil 4 at 1080p.\n\nThe 7700 XT exhibits a slight ceiling with the 12400, but is mostly comparable. The B580 ran at 128 FPS AVG with the 9800X3D and 122 with the 5600X. We didn\u2019t run this test on the 12400 configuration. The B570 had all 3, though: The 9800X3D has it at 110 FPS AVG, or 5% ahead of the 5600X configuration and 5.7% ahead of the 12400 configuration.\n\nThe RTX 4060 ran at 107.9 FPS AVG on the 9800X3D and 106.5 FPS AVG on the 12400. The RTX 4060 shows a top-to-bottom range of 1.3%, smaller than the observed difference on the B570. This slightly reconstructs the stack such that the B570 ends up tied or slightly under the RTX 4060 rather than ahead of it by 2.1%; however, the reduction puts the RTX 4060 on like-for-like hardware maximally 2% ahead. Between the two, they\u2019re realistically about the same.\n\nAs for 0.1% low performance, the Arc cards underperform compared to the RTX 4060 on all CPUs. This does not get disproportionately worse on the 5600X or 12400 and instead scales with the average. The disadvantage in lows exists on the 9800X3D standard CPU and on the lower-end ones.\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate - 1440p\n\nNext up is Baldur\u2019s Gate 3. We only run this test at 1440p and 4K due to the low load.\n\nIn this test, the RX 7700 XT found a hard bottleneck with the i5-12400. This capped out at 79 FPS AVG, as opposed to the unbound test at 133 FPS AVG. This would be appropriate for a CPU review, but does not show GPU performance. The RTX 4060 on the 12400 further reinforces these limits (although bounces off of them way harder, with much worse 0.1% lows as a result of the CPU, not the GPU). The RTX 4060 exhibits identical AVG FPS with all 3 configurations. The lows are better on the 9800X3D as it allows the GPU to hit frame pacing without external binds, which is expected behavior.\n\nThe RX 7600 is restricted by the CPUs with the 5600X and i5-12400, with both lower than the 9800X3D\u2019s result. Again, this is normal and is the expected result from a CPU bind. Lows are hurt as a result of limiting the ceiling.\n\nThe B580 also experienced a performance reduction with the 12400, but a much larger one with the R5 5600X. To do some quick math:\n\nThe RX 7600 at 77.1 FPS AVG with the 12400 gains 11.1% by moving to the 9800X3D.\n\nThe B580 with the 12400 at 63.7 FPS AVG gains 16.2% by moving to the 9800X3D. That\u2019s not as a big of a difference as we might expect, but it is larger than we saw on the 7600.\n\nThe 5600X is a far different story, with a maximum uplift of 32% from the 5600X unit to the 9800X3D at 74 FPS AVG. This may be the driver overhead.\n\nThe B570 shows similar behavior, with scaling worse on the 5600X than on the 12400. Lows are not disproportionately worse on any of them; in other words, the lows follow the behavior relative to other devices also scaling with the CPU.\n\nThis would possibly change our recommendation for a 5600X user, but not a 12400 user where there is only a 3 FPS difference.\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 - 4K\n\nAt 4K, the 7700 XT is the same on both CPUs for AVG FPS, but worse in frametime pacing on the 12400. This is expected behavior when using a worse CPU.\n\nThe A770 has identical performance between the 9800X3D and 5600X.\n\nThe RTX 4060 has identical performance between all 3. There is a 1.3 FPS AVG difference as a result of not only run-to-run variance between the 3, but also the frametime pacing is also much better on the 9800X3D for the RTX 4060, which will influence the AVG FPS results.\n\nThe RX 7600 has the same AVG FPS on all 3 CPUs, with better frametime pacing on the 9800X3D.\n\nThe B580 has identical performance on all 3 CPUs for AVG FPS, with a slight 1% low advantage on the 9800X3D.\n\nThe B570 is identical on all 3 CPUs, with better lows on the 9800X3D.\n\nAll of this behavior is expected for a GPU bind.\n\nBlack Myth - 1080p\n\nBlack Myth will be brief as well: At 1080p/High, which is our standardized test platform, there is no meaningful, broad difference in scaling.\n\nThe numbers do not change in any meaningful way. The 7700 XT is the same on both, the 4060 is the same on all 3, the 7600 is the same on all 3 (with the exception of reduced lows on the 12400), the B580 is the same on all 3 and lows are within variance run-to-run. The B570 is the same on all 3, with lows within the wider variance at the low-end. The A770 is the same on both.\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 - 1080p\n\nWe\u2019ll look at one more.\n\nIn Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2, they are all the same from CPU-to-CPU, with a few notes.\n\nThe 7700 XT is roughly identical. The RTX 4060 is mostly identical, with the 12400 potentially showing marginally worse performance. The RX 7600 is the same across all 3, with slightly worse 0.1% lows.\n\nThe B580 is the same across all 3, with worse 0.1% lows on the 5600X specifically. The B570 is the same across all 3 in all 3 metrics.\n\nThe A770 is the same in all 3 metrics.\n\nDiscussion\n\nLet\u2019s quickly talk results: First, in most scenarios, there is no meaningful impact. The biggest situation was with the 5600X in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3. The 12400 did not react as violently. The secondary impact is in some 0.1% low differences, but these often also manifested on other devices.\n\nThis does not affect how we review GPUs. We have to make that clear here. There is no data to support that our conclusions would be different if we ran lower-end CPUs with these cards. It would just cap the ceiling of how much change you can see.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t driver overhead or that there can\u2019t be. We are aware that multiple outlets have now shown this. However, we tested with High and Ultra settings and simply were not able to replicate the impact. Our belief is that in scenarios of extremely high framerate, such as 200+, or in situations where the CPU is heavily bound from low settings and lower resolutions, that\u2019d be where you\u2019d see the difference. But we don\u2019t test GPUs for review with low settings and we currently don\u2019t test esports titles, so these would not show up in our data.\n\nOthers do. We\u2019d encourage you to check them, as everyone in this space provides a different set of tests for unique value. This story is long enough as is, but what we can say is that our entire usual suite has now been validated on two low-end CPUs and we have found the performance does not meaningfully change the conclusions except perhaps in one main scenario tested.\n\nIntel Arc B570 Unbound Testing\n\nGrab a GN15 All-Over Print Component Mouse Mat for a high-quality mousing surface that'll fit your keyboard & mouse.

This is pretty close to linear. The B570 roughly ties the A770 in AVG FPS and 1% low, with 0.1% lows close enough. It also outperforms the RTX 4060 by 11%, the 3060 by 23%, and the A580 (read our review) by the same. The RX 7600 card landed at around 32 FPS AVG, giving the B570 a notable lead, especially at the price. There are also substantial improvements on the RX 6600, which was the previous leader in this price class (though it eventually sold for cheaper).\n\nFor some references to older cards, we also have the GTX 1070 (watch our review), GTX 1060 watch our review), and GTX 1650 (watch our review) present.\n\nFFXIV - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the B570 ran at 75 FPS AVG against the B580\u2019s 86 FPS AVG, which puts the B580 about 15% ahead of the B570. It had a marginally higher lead at 4K. The B570 now sits between the A770 and A750 (watch our review), so the A770 has slightly re-positioned itself as resolution came down. The RTX 4060 also gets closer to the B570, now at 72 FPS AVG, nearing equivalence despite a larger gap previously.\n\nThis is the same behavior we saw in the B580 review: The higher the resolution goes, generally speaking, the more of an advantage Battlemage has over its peers in the class. The lead over the RX 7600 is 14% here, with the RX 6600 XT and 3060 (watch our review) below it. Some older reference anchors include the RTX 2060 (watch our review), GTX 1070, 1060, and 1650.\n\nFrametime pacing on the B570 is good overall, performing similarly to the RTX 4060 for frame-to-frame interval.\n\nFFXIV - 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, the B570 loses its advantage against the RX 7600 and RTX 4060. The B580 maintains a lead over these two cards with its 124 FPS AVG, although its frametime pacing, indicated by the 0.1% lows, is worse than what we\u2019re seeing on the RTX 4060 and RX 7600. We dove into this in the B580 review.\n\nOverall, Battlemage and the B570 remain a large improvement over Alchemist, especially at the price; however, we still see that reduction in relative performance as resolution decreases, even with an unbound configuration. At 1440p and higher, Battlemage when unbound seems to be more competitive than it is at 1080p.\n\nStarfield - 1440p\n\nStarfield is next. Intel had a lot of problems with Starfield when the game launched -- namely, the problem was that it didn\u2019t work.\n\nBut it does now. Despite working, NVIDIA and AMD retain an advantage with the RTX 4060 and RX 7600 cards. The B580\u2019s 41 FPS AVG leads the B570\u2019s 36 FPS by 12%. The RX 7600 leads by 17%, with the 4060 leading by a staggering 31%. This is an example of one of the games where Battlemage is disadvantaged even when unbound, even at 1440p.\n\nStarfield - 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, the B570 GPU ran at 47 FPS AVG, planting it between the A770 of last-gen and the RX 6600 XT. Against Alchemist, it\u2019s clear that Battlemage is a huge improvement when considering the configuration size of the A770 GPU against the B570 GPU. Against itself, Intel has definitely improved in huge ways. Against competition, the RTX 4060 and RX 7600 both hold advantages at both the resolution and with the game.\n\nThe B580 ends up 10% ahead of the B570 in this test, so its value isn\u2019t always linear.\n\nResident Evil 4 - 4K\n\nResident Evil 4 at 4K was one of the B580\u2019s strongest titles. In this test, the B580 marginally outperformed the RTX 4060 Ti (watch our review) in averages, with the 0.1% lows close enough to be comparable given wider margins. The B580 at 46 FPS AVG leads the B570\u2019s 40 FPS AVG by about 16%, aligning with some of the other 4K results. The B570 ends up outperforming the RX 7600 by 7% and the RTX 4060 by 14%, which is an incredible lead for the B570 when fully GPU-bound. Considering the RTX 4060\u2019s price, this is a big lead for Intel.\n\nThe improvement on the A580 is also noteworthy, with similar gains.\n\nLows on the B570 are not meaningfully different from those on the RX 7600, 6600 XT, or RTX 4060. The frame pacing is comparable.\n\nResident Evil 4 - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the B580 is still spaced about 16% over the B570. The B570\u2019s lead over the RX 7600 has reduced and they are now mostly equivalent, with the B570 experiencing less consistent lows. This is something we showed in our B580 review, if you\u2019d like to learn more about why it hits this ceiling.\n\nThe RTX 4060 also climbs relative to the B570, with its 70 FPS AVG result reducing the B570\u2019s advantage to just 6%. This is while the RTX 4060 maintains slightly better 0.1% low results for a better average frame-to-frame interval. The B570 is still overall better here, but as we continue to reduce resolution, that\u2019ll change.\n\nResident Evil 4 - 1080p\n\nThis is 1080p. With these settings, the B570 is now roughly tied with the RX 7600. The RTX 4060 is encroaching on the B570, which has had its lead when GPU-bound cut to 2%. That\u2019s still impressive for the price and for the age of Intel\u2019s new architecture. If we imagine the B570 line item were some hypothetical new NVIDIA card at $220, this would be an amazing move in the right direction for NVIDIA. The fact that Intel is still proving itself and working through some teething pains is the only hesitation that remains, though they have reduced that generationally so far.\n\nEven still, the B570\u2019s frametime pacing is inconsistent. It bounces around in this title, with run-to-run variance higher than we see on any AMD or NVIDIA device. This remains a challenge in some specific games. It\u2019s overall acceptable, but not as consistent as its peers.\n\nAs for the B580, its lead over the B570 is about 18 FPS, or 16.4%.\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 - 4K\n\nNext is Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, which remains one of the best titles launched in the last couple years.\n\nAt 4K, the B570 ran at 40 FPS AVG with our Ultra settings. This has it just below the RTX 3060 and above the A580, RX 6600 (watch our review), and RTX 2060. The B580\u2019s 44.8 FPS AVG result leads the B570 by 13%, with both exhibiting limited scaling in the 0.1% lows, indicating frame-to-frame consistency issues as compared to NVIDIA neighbors.\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 - 1440p\n\n1440p has the B570 at 67 FPS AVG, between the A750 and A580. The generational uplift isn\u2019t nearly as impressive here as in some of the other games. The B580 is about 11% better than the B570 here, with the RTX 4060\u2019s 80 FPS AVG putting it 20% improved in average FPS, plus a significant uplift in 0.1% lows to represent smoother frametime pacing. The RX 7600 outperforms both the RTX 4060 and B570, including in lows.\n\nCyberpunk: Phantom Liberty - 1440p\n\nLet\u2019s move on to Cyberpunk: Phantom Liberty at 1440p.\n\nIn this test, the B570 ran at 46 FPS AVG, with the B580 at 54 FPS AVG. The B580\u2019s lead is about 16%, which is consistent with other high load scenarios; in fact, the B580 bordered on the RTX 4070 in this test, which we didn\u2019t see happen elsewhere but which has consistently happened in this game. Its lows aren\u2019t nearly as good as what the RTX 4070 offers (at 50 FPS 0.1% to 31 FPS), but this was still a good showing for Battlemage.\n\nThe B570 reinforces that, functionally tying in average with the RX 6700 XT (watch our review). This is an impressive feat. For both, it\u2019s the memory bandwidth benefitting the cards here. Unfortunately, the low pacing just isn\u2019t as good on the B570 as its neighboring devices, including the larger config A750. The B570 leads the 4060 by 18% here in a staggering flip favoring Battlemage for averages, again with the caveat of the lows being better on NVIDIA.\n\nCyberpunk: Phantom Liberty - 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, the B570 ran at 71 FPS AVG, with the B580 sustaining a 13% uplift in average framerate. Battlemage still has worse lows than neighbors. At this resolution, the RTX 4060 begins to encroach on B570 and functionally ties it in average framerate while offering substantially improved frame pacing behavior. The RX 7600 is the same, roughly tied with the RTX 4060 and overall a better experience than the B570.\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong - 1080p\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong is up next, tested at 1080p/high first. With these settings, the B570 maintains about 40 FPS AVG with lows around or below 30 FPS averaged. This has the RX 6600 XT (watch our review) and RTX 3060 both above the B570, with the B570 above the RX 6600 non-XT (watch our review) and RTX 2060. The B580\u2019s 46 FPS AVG gives it a lead of 15%, with the RX 7600 16% ahead and RTX 4060 (at 54 FPS AVG) ahead of the B570 by 36%. That\u2019s a huge lead for the 4060.\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the B570 is reduced to 30 FPS AVG. This gives the RTX 4060 a 22% lead, with the B580\u2019s 35 FPS about 15% ahead.\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 - 1440p\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 is up next, first at 1440p/Max without RT. In this test, the B580 sticks to a 15% lead over the B570, so that\u2019s consistent. The RTX 4060 leads the B580 and the B570 alike, with the RX 7600 about tied with the RTX 4060 and within run-to-run variance. The B570 is not particularly strong here. It\u2019s about the same as the 3060 and outperforms the RX 6600. The price is noteworthy, although the B580 is overall more competitive in raw performance. In the least, lows are comparable in this test to non-Intel parts.\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 - 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, performance falls overall as compared to competition. This is consistent with other tests. The gap from the B570 to the B580 remains 15%, with the 4060 now leading the B570 by 30% and the B580 by 7%. AMD\u2019s RX 7600 also holds a similar lead.\n\nDying Light 2 - 1440p\n\nDying Light 2 is up now. At 1440p, the B570 ran at 53 FPS AVG in what\u2019s one of the strongest relative showings unbound for the card. This has it ahead of the RTX 4060 by 8%. Lows are also better, which is important for Arc. The lead over the RX 7600 is 13%. As for the B580, Intel\u2019s $250 baseline model is about 18.6% ahead of the B570 here.\n\nDying Light 2 - 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, the B580 maintained an 18.7% advantage at 87 FPS to 73 FPS AVG over the B570. The RTX 4060 lands between the two and is closer to the B570. Intel has marginally better 0.1% low averages here. The RX 7600 is roughly tied with the B570 in this test.\n\nIntel Arc B570 Ray Tracing Benchmarks\n\nGrab a GN15 Large Anti-Static Modmat to celebrate our 15th Anniversary and for a high-quality PC building work surface. The Modmat features useful PC building diagrams and is anti-static conductive. Purchases directly fund our work! (or consider a direct donation or a Patreon contribution!)\n\nWe\u2019re moving on to ray tracing now, tested with the unbound configuration. We\u2019ll keep this as focused as possible. These tests are not comparable to the rasterization performance, especially as some settings (such as upscaling) may change.\n\nRay Tracing: Resident Evil 4 - 4K\n\nIn Resident Evil 4 at 4K with RT and FSR, the B570 ran at 43 FPS AVG and with lows overall acceptable for its average. That has it ahead of the RTX 4060 in a strong showing for Intel. The B580 leads the B570 by 16%, which puts it functionally identical in performance to the RTX 4060 Ti.\n\nRay Tracing: Resident Evil 4 - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the B570 ran at 66 FPS AVG and tied with the RX 7600 in every metric. Considering the B570\u2019s price advantage at time of writing, that\u2019s a competitive spot to be. The RTX 4060 leads the B570 by 8%, flipping from what we saw at the higher resolution and consistent with knowledge that Arc disproportionately scales better at higher resolution. The B580 is 15% ahead of the B570 here.\n\nRay Tracing: Resident Evil 4 - 1080p\n\nAt 1080p, the B570 ran at 81 FPS AVG. The RX 7600 now slightly outperforms it. Realistically, these are the same perceived performance, but lower resolution performance scaling remains stronger on NVIDIA and AMD. The RTX 4060 is now up at 95 FPS AVG, a lead over the B570 of 17%. The B580 is about tied with the 4060.\n\nRay Tracing: Dying Light 2 - 1080p\n\nDying Light 2 with RT is up now. At 1080p, the B570 ran at 55 FPS AVG and held proportional lows, which is what we want. These results have it close enough to the RTX 4060 that they\u2019re experientially the same. The RTX 4060 has a lead of 5% over the B570, with the B580 leading both at 65 FPS AVG. The B580\u2019s average framerate is 18% higher than the B570 in a notable distinction. The RX 7600 lands below all of these, closer to the RTX 3060 and below the A580. Intel\u2019s Arc has overall strong RT performance in this title.\n\nRay Tracing: Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 - 1080p\n\nIn Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 with RT and at 1080p, the B570 ran at 39 FPS AVG. Unfortunately for Intel, this is one of its worst relative results. Ray tracing in this game is hard for the Intel cards. They don\u2019t maintain the scaling from elsewhere when tested against the 7600 or RTX 4060 here.\n\nRay Tracing: Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 - 1440p\n\nAt 1440p, the B570 holds a 31 FPS AVG, the B580 a 36 FPS AVG, and the 7600 and 4060 are both just under 40 FPS AVG. Again, Intel is disproportionately disfavored in this test set.\n\nRay Tracing: Cyberpunk - 1080p Medium\n\nCyberpunk with RT Medium is next. Battlemage remains super competitive here, with the B570 performing better than the RTX 4060. The average framerate is about the same, but the RTX 4060 suffers from wildly inconsistent frametimes in this test. We showed that in the B580 review with a frametime plot, where the 4060 was spiky as a result of its VRAM limitations.\n\nThe B580 keeps its 16% lead over the B570 in this test, with both outdoing the RTX 4060. The RTX 4060 Ti even struggles in this, also suffering from inconsistent run-to-run variance and low performance for 0.1%. AMD has problems of its own, mostly just that it\u2019s unable to compete in this test. The RX 7600 is down under 30 FPS AVG. At this price point, Battlemage is actually the best in this specific test and setup.\n\nRay Tracing: Black Myth Wukong - 1080p (Experimental)\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong is up now. This is one of our experimental charts. This designation is reserved for charts where we\u2019re still evaluating the methodology and the accuracy, and so you shouldn\u2019t assign as much weight to these since we are still leaving open the possibility of some sort of test limitation or issue.\n\nAs it stands now, the B570 lands between the A750 and A580 with RT. The B580 is about the same as the RX 7800 XT (watch our review), with the B570 outperforming the RX 7600, so both are competitive with AMD. NVIDIA is up in orbit though with this game, with the RTX 4060 up at 52 FPS AVG in this test with these settings.\n\nPower Consumption & Efficiency (Experimental)\n\nEfficiency testing is up next. This is also a part of our suite of experimental tests, meaning we are still developing methods and that there is more room than typical for possible error or future revisions. This testing is done with an Elmor Labs PMD2 that has been calibrated personally by Elmor on our request. Testing includes both PCIe slot and PCIe cable power consumption, but excludes all other power, including the CPU.\n\nPower Consumption: Idle\n\nIn idle testing, Intel Arc remains power hungry as compared to its competition. Using our test platform as configured for benchmarking, the B570 pulled about 30W idle. The B580 was around 35W. This is overall high.\n\nEfficiency: Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 (1440p)\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 at 1440p shows FPS/W, meaning that higher framerate and lower power will create the most efficient result. Higher is better.\n\nThe most efficient device here so far is the 4060 Ti of those tested. The B580 was in the middle of the pack, at 0.52 FPS/W. That had it between the 6600 series. The B570 is more efficient than the B580, at 0.55 FPS/W and below the RX 7800 XT.\n\nEfficiency: FFXIV (1440p)\n\nFinal Fantasy 14 at 1440p is an OK showing for the B570. At 0.54 FPS/W, it\u2019s near the RTX 4060 and better than the B580. This is an OK spot to be in for Intel.\n\nEfficiency: FFXIV (1080p)\n\nAt 1080p, the B570 produces 0.81 FPS/W and sits again below the RTX 4060 and above the B580 and 7800 XT. Against AMD, Intel is looking good, but NVIDIA maintains its advantage here.\n\nEfficiency: Black Myth Wukong (1080p)\n\nIn Black Myth at 1080p, the B570 sits between the RTX 4060 and B580 again. Performance is acceptable overall and far improved from the A-series, like the A580 or A770.\n\nCyberpunk: Phantom Liberty (RT, 1080p)\n\nCyberpunk is the last one. This is a pretty good showing for Intel: The B570 isn\u2019t tied with the RTX 4060, but it\u2019s getting a lot closer. The 0.28 FPS/W result is far improved over the 7800 XT and puts it in 4th of the devices tested so far. Note that the 4090 (watch our review) looks inefficient here as it is becoming bound by other components at this resolution.\n\nIntel Arc B570 Conclusion\n\nVisit our Patreon page to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a direct donation or buying something from our GN Store!) Additionally, when you purchase through links to retailers on our site, we may earn a small affiliate commission.\n\nProviding some highlights, our B570 conclusion generally feels very similar to our conclusion with the B580 in that Intel has definitely improved over Alchemist. The B570 and B580 are often outperforming the A750 and A770, which are larger configs, especially the A770. That\u2019s a good place for Intel to be against itself. Against the competition, there\u2019s a lot of trading back and forth. There are some games where the B570 is similar to or slightly exceeds the RTX 4060, but there are situations where the opposite is true. The trend that persists is that the higher the resolution is, regardless of the discussion around driver overhead, the Battlemage series cards will typically either gain on the competition or pull away from them, depending on where they started. You could also look at it the other way and say that as you approach lower resolutions like 1080p, results get closer together, and many times they\u2019ll trade blows.\n\nLike with our B580 review, we didn\u2019t experience any spectacular failures and crashes this time. Compared to Alchemist, the card is far improved. While NVIDIA\u2019s drivers are known to be the most stable, Intel is certainly improving here.\n\nIn terms of value, the B580 remains a very competitive price, and the B570 is similar. On average in our results, the B580 tends to be about 15-16% better than the B570. At the upper end of that, we\u2019ll see about a 18.7-19% advantage for the B580 over the B570. At the lower-end, we\u2019ll see about a 10% gain or so. That performance difference largely aligns with the price difference between the 2 cards with the B580 going for roughly $250 vs the B570\u2019s roughly $220 price.",

            "content": "In an unexpected move, Intel quietly cut the prices of its latest Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids' processors approximately four months after their formal introduction in late September. The price slash is quite dramatic as the flagship model now costs $12,460, or $5,340 less than at launch. As a result, Intel's Xeon 6 CPUs are now cheaper than AMD's latest EPYC 'Genoa' processors both in absolute numbers and in terms of per-core pricing.\n\nIntel's Xeon 6-series 'Granite Rapids' processors were the company's most expensive CPUs ever. However, they are now considerably cheaper than they were four months ago. Intel has not officially announced the price cuts, but these adjustments are reflected in the company's online database at ark.intel.com, meaning the price changes are official.\n\nDepending on the model, the price reduction varies from $1,585 for the 96-core Xeon 6975P all the way to $5,340 for the 128-core range-topping Xeon 6980P. As for percentages, three out of five Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids' processors are now 30% cheaper, while two saw reductions of 13% (6972P) and 20% (6952P).\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Intel and AMD Performance Core Processors Model Price Old Price Price Per Core Cores/Threads Base/Boost (GHz) TDP L3 Cache (MB) cTDP (W) Xeon 6980P (GNR) $12,460 $17,800 $97 128 / 256 2.0 / 3.9 500W 504 - Xeon 6979P (GNR) $11,025 $15,750 $92 120 / 240 2.1 / 3.9 500W 504 - EPYC Genoa 9654 $11,805 $11,805 $123 96 / 192 2.4 / 3.7 360W 384 320-400 Xeon 6972P (GNR) $10,220 $11,805 $106 96 / 192 2.4 / 3.9 500W 480 - Xeon 6952P (GNR) $9,115 $11,400 $95 96 / 192 2.1 / 3.9 400W 480 ? EPYC Genoa 9634 $10,304 $10,304 $123 84 / 168 2.25 / 3.7 290W 384 240-300 Xeon 6960P (GNR) $9,625 $13,750 $134 72 / 144 2.7 / 3.9 500W 432 - Intel Xeon 8592+ (EMR) $11,600 $11,600 $181 64 / 128 1.9 / 3.9 350W 320 - EPYC Genoa 9554 $9,087 $9,087 $142 64 / 128 3.1 / 3.75 360W 256 320-400\n\nDue to the price cut, Intel's Xeon 6 processors are now significantly more affordable. The range-topping 128-core Xeon 6980P is now less expensive than AMD's top-of-the-line 96-core EPYC 9654, as are other members of the Granite Rapids family compared to their direct rivals from AMD's 5th Generation EPYC lineup.\n\nHowever, there is a major development beyond that. Perhaps even more significant is that Intel's Xeon 6900P-series processors are now cheaper than AMD's EPYC 9600-series CPUs in per-core pricing. This may not sound like a big deal in general, but it makes Intel's Xeon 'Granite Rapids' processors more competitive for cloud service providers that strive for multiple metrics, including performance per socket, cores per socket, performance per watt, and of course, total cost of ownership (TCO). As for TCO, this aspect may not be the strongest point of Granite Rapids when compared to AMD's Genoa. For example, AMD's 96-core EPYC 9654 has a processor base power of 360W, whereas Intel's 96-core 6972P consumes a rather whopping 500W, thus resulting in a higher TDP.\n\nIt should be noted that we are dealing with Intel's Recommended Customer Price (RCP), which represents 1,000-unit purchase quantities. Big server OEMs like Dell, HPE, and Lenovo, as well as major CSPs like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, Meta, and Microsoft Azure, purchase Intel's processors in much larger quantities and at different prices that are often negotiated. Furthermore, large CSPs also tend to buy the so-called off-roadmap parts with specifications tailored to their performance and TCO requirements at pre-arranged quantities. Therefore, RCP pricing has little, if any, effect on actual purchase prices for the big players.\n\nThen again, the very fact that Intel needed to lower the prices of its leading-edge Xeon 6900P-series 'Granite Rapids' processors by as much as $5,340 per unit indicates that it is not exactly satisfied with the number of units sold and would like to increase sales. Another reason for the price reduction could be Intel's intention to stop, or at least slow down, AMD's strengthening position in the data center CPU market. AMD commanded a 24.2% share of the data center CPU market in Q3 2024, its highest share since the mid-2000s, according to Mercury Research.",

Intel is one of those brands, having famously vacated real estate at the Las Vegas Convention Center in the wake of COVID, in favor of, for the past two years, a suite at The Venetian Expo.\n\nThe Intel Technology Showcase at CES 2025 was an invitation-only space for customers, press, influencers, and ecosystem partners to get uninterrupted hands-on time with Intel technology and product experts. The room glowed Intel blue, and at every turn were product displays and entertaining activations (which Intel is known for among our editors) that brought the technology to life.\n\nAn activation that served as the intentional hero moment was the AI Living City, a giant LED display that brought to life what Intel is doing in AI (\u201cAI on the client, AI at the edge, and AI in the cloud\u201d).\n\nMore from the Intel Archives:\n\nAcross three stations in front of the Living City, participants could input their own data, from physical poses caught by a camera, to preferences on types of businesses they\u2019d run (like an ice cream shop), to scanning physical objects representing verticals Intel has brought AI solutions to (like sports and AI learning). The Intel AI PCs at each station interpreted the data via a \u201cstable diffusion\u201d engine that runs locally on the machine to generate a building design representing the participant\u2019s choices. The building was then added in real time to the Living City among all the other attendee contributions, with the image shared via email or QR code to post to social.\n\n\u201cThis is a new experience that we created for AWS and CES and is actually going to all of our tier one events, so that we\u2019re actually creating a level of consistency and engagement,\u201d explained Victor Torregroza, experiences program manager at Intel.\n\nOther memorable zones included an AI-enhanced vehicle demo, and an activation featuring a case study by quick-service restaurant Oliver in Australia, which utilizes a conversational, unscripted AI (powered by Intel Core Ultra series 2 processors) for its drive-thru experience, Ollie. It allows consumers to use natural speech for efficient recommendations and orders, something CES attendees were able to test out right in the showcase.\n\nOn top of demonstrations, Intel provided charging stations, and hosted coffee breaks, meetings, and receptions in the space, allowing it to be a hub of special events and comfort, on top of an immersive product showcase.

Last week, it published a paper showing that its latest model\u2019s performance matched the most advanced reasoning models in the world. These models are being trained in data centers that are spending billions on Nvidia\u2019s faster, very pricey AI chips.\n\nThe reaction across the tech industry to DeepSeek\u2019s high-performance, lower-cost model has been wild. Pat Gelsinger, for instance, took to X with glee, posting, \u201cThank you DeepSeek team.\u201d\n\nWisdom is learning the lessons we thought we already knew.

The markets are getting it wrong, this will make AI\u2026 \u2014 Pat Gelsinger (@PGelsinger) January 27, 2025\n\nGelsinger is, of course, the recently former CEO of Intel, a hardware engineer, and current chairman of his own IPO-bound startup, Gloo, a messaging and engagement platform for churches. He left Intel in December after four years and an attempt at chasing Nvidia with Intel\u2019s alternative AI GPUs, the Gaudi 3 AI.\n\nGelsinger wrote that DeepSeek should remind the tech industry of its three most important lessons: lower costs mean wider-spread adoption; ingenuity flourishes under constraints; and \u201cOpen Wins. DeepSeek will help reset the increasingly closed world of foundational AI model work,\u201d he wrote. OpenAI and Anthropic are both closed source.\n\nGelsinger told TechCrunch that R1 is so impressive, Gloo has already decided not to adopt and pay for OpenAI. Gloo is building an AI service called Kallm, which will offer a chatbot and other services.\n\n\u201cMy Gloo engineers are running R1 today,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could\u2019ve run o1 \u2014 well, they can only access o1, through the APIs.\u201d\n\nInstead, in two weeks, Gloo expects to have rebuilt Kallm from scratch \u201cwith our own foundational model that\u2019s all open source,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nHe said he thinks DeepSeek will make AI so affordable, AI won\u2019t just be everywhere. Good AI will be everywhere. \u201cI want better AI in my Oura Ring. I want better AI in my hearing aid. I want more AI in my phone. I want better AI in my embedded devices, like the voice recognition in my EV,\u201d he says.\n\nGelsinger\u2019s happy reaction was perhaps at odds with others who were less thrilled that reasoning foundational models now have a higher-performing and far more affordable challenger. AI has been growing more expensive, not less.\n\nOthers reacted by implying DeepSeek must have fudged its numbers somehow and training must have been more costly. Some thought it couldn\u2019t say it used higher-end chips because of U.S. AI chip export restrictions to China. Others were poking holes in its performance, finding spots where other models did better. Still others believe that OpenAI\u2019s next model, o3, will so outpace R1 when it is released that the status quo will be repaired.\n\nGelsinger shrugs all of that off. \u201cYou will never have full transparency, given most of the work was done in China,\u201d he said. \u201cBut still, all evidence is that it\u2019s 10-50x cheaper in their training than o1.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek proves that AI can be moved forward \u201cby engineering creativity, not throwing more hardware power and compute resources at the problem. So that\u2019s thrilling,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for this being a Chinese developer with all that implies, like concerns over privacy and censorship, Gelsinger metaphorically shakes his head.\n\n\u201cHaving the Chinese remind us of the power of open ecosystems is maybe a touch embarrassing for our community, for the Western world,\u201d he said.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Interestingly, the total investment will be going up in 2025 against what it was in 2024, but the percentage distributions will be changing.\n\nIntel has several noteworthy product developments coming out in 2025, Guzzi noted. The Core Ultra chips will be making an appearance, the new Xeon processor line, among others, and thus Intel is looking to call attention to those. But with Intel\u2019s margins not what they used to be, and a lot of Intel\u2019s free cash going into the foundry program, that leaves Intel reconsidering a lot of its sales and marketing initiatives.\n\nPrice Cuts, Ratings Stability\n\nWith a new line of Xeon processors set to emerge, it really is not surprising that Xeon 6 models are looking at price cuts, according to reports. In fact, Intel reportedly cut the prices on its Xeon 6 \u201cGranite Rapids\u201d chips by as much as $5,340 against what they were at launch. Now, Intel\u2019s chips are actually cheaper than their equivalent at AMD (AMD), which could be a very useful development.\n\nHowever, Cantor Fitzgerald is taking something of a wait-and-see approach here, and is maintaining its Neutral stance. Its price target is also holding at $22 per share, which is not far from where it currently trades. With Intel looking to report results soon, Cantor Fitzgerald is looking for a match for expectations, and a slight paring back of future guidance.\n\nIs Intel a Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock based on one Buy, 22 Holds and four Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 53.12% loss in its share price over the past year, the average INTC price target of $23.61 per share implies 17.03% upside potential.\n\nSee more INTC analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

Judge Taranto authored the opinion.\n\nIn its 2021 decision, the CAFC found in part that Intel satisfied Article III standing requirements for appealing from the PTAB but remanded the case on a number of issues. The present appeal involves Qualcomm\u2019s challenge to the PTAB\u2019s new claim construction of the term \u201chardware buffer\u201d in which it \u201cchanged its earlier construction, which excluded \u2018a temporary buffer\u2019 from the scope\u2026to a broader construction, under which a \u2018hardware buffer\u2019 is \u2018not limited to a \u2018permanent\u2019 buffer.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe parties generally disagreed about what is required for the buffer to be a \u201chardware buffer.\u201d Intel said that a buffer is a \u201chardware buffer\u201d if \u201cthe memory cells used by the buffer are \u2018physically separate\u2019 from the memory cells into which the software is loaded and from which the processor executes it (\u2018system memory\u2019).\u201d\n\nQualcomm proposed a narrower view, namely, that \u201ca buffer is a hardware buffer only if its memory cells are never used for system memory, rather than assigned to be used for that function (allocated) upon the turning on of power (or runtime).\u201d\n\nThe Federal Circuit, however, said that \u201cneither party provides an illuminating or persuasive explanation of its position\u201d regarding Qualcomm\u2019s assertion that Intel\u2019s view renders \u201chardware\u201d superfluous, and thus the court turned to the specification and prosecution history for guidance. Upon analysis of the specification, the CAFC said none of the three uses of the phrase \u201chardware buffer\u201d elucidated why either Qualcomm\u2019s or Intel\u2019s approach is the right one.\n\nAs to the prosecution history, though, the court said it was \u201cilluminating.\u201d In response to an examiner rejection, \u201cQualcomm did not even hint, let alone declare, that the Svensson [prior art] intermediate storage area\u2014undisputedly allocated at runtime\u2014was outside its claimed \u2018hardware buffer.\u2019\u201d As a result, although the court felt that \u201cthere is something to be said for each side\u2019s view of how to read the claim phrase \u2018hardware buffer,\u2019\u201d there was no need to decide which meaning is better. The opinion explained:\n\n\u201cThis case is governed by the broadest-reasonable-interpretation standard\u2026which recognizes the distinctive duty of applicants or patentees to respond to uncertainty of scope by making clarifying changes\u2026 We conclude that Qualcomm has not persuasively shown the Board majority\u2019s current claim construction to be unreasonable. We therefore affirm the Board\u2019s claim construction and its resulting unpatentability determinations.\u201d\n\nThe CAFC thus affirmed the PTAB\u2019s decision to hold all challenged claims of Qualcomm\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 8,838,949 unpatentable.",

The struggling chip maker lost 60% of its value over the course of the year \u2013 a blow made even more painful by the double- and triple-digit gains enjoyed by many of Intel\u2019s peers.\n\nThe company has recently been in the spotlight, with rumors swirling about a potential acquisition led by none other than Elon Musk. While the speculation briefly lifted Intel\u2019s share price by high single digits, the stock has largely traded sideways since.\n\nYet, investor Paul Franke sees glimmers of hope on the horizon. With Q4 2024 earnings set to be revealed on January 30, Franke highlights a number of developments that suggest this could be the moment to jump in.\n\n\u201cIf you want a deep-value Big Tech name to add to your portfolio, Intel may be the only game in town,\u201d the 5-star investor asserts.\n\nFranke points to Intel\u2019s valuation, which, by several measures, has fallen to its lowest levels since the 1990 recession. Compared to other semiconductor giants, the investor notes that Intel is trading at a 60% to 70% discount.\n\n\u201cINTC is now the least expensive of the largest capitalization semiconductor businesses for new investment, when looking at a projected refresh in operations during 2025-26,\u201d Franke points out.\n\nStill, Franke emphasizes that valuation alone doesn\u2019t seal the deal. He points to both technical and broader developments that signal Intel could be on the rise in the months ahead. For one, over the last six months, Intel has seen weekly buying trends outpace selling activity \u2013 a dynamic Franke interprets as a sign of \u201cbetter times ahead.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Franke highlights a range of catalysts on the horizon that could propel the stock: \u201cA successful restructuring, potential takeover offers, and asset spin-offs could drive significant returns for investors in 2025.\u201d\n\nThe investor also notes that Republican leadership in Washington \u2013 which tends to apply less scrutiny to large mergers \u2013 makes any potential acquisition more likely to proceed.\n\nBelieving that \u201c2025 could be a solid year,\u201d Franke assigns a Buy rating to Intel shares. (To watch Franke\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nOn the other hand, Wall Street is not quite ready to take a flyer on Intel. The stock carries a consensus Hold (i.e., Neutral) rating based on 22 Holds, 4 Sells, and a single Buy recommendation. Even so, the 12-month average price target of $23.87 implies a potential upside of ~15%.

It has become mainstream now,\u201d said RealmOne Chief Financial Officer Pearce Lantzy. \u201cWe are competing with them in the way that we gather data, how we act on that intelligence \u2014 and all the technology that goes in behind that.\u201d\n\nRealmOne delivers full lifecycle intelligence data management and cybersecurity capabilities in support of critical intelligence community and Defense Department missions.\n\n\u201cThe company is on the front line,\u201d Lantzy said. \u201cRealmOne delivers timely, actionable intelligence from the warfighter to the White House. We play a key role in supporting our nation through those intelligence-related challenges.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s competition in the field, \u201ca lot of companies out there attempting to do what we do,\u201d Lantzy said. To keep ahead, RealmOne looks to differentiate not just its offerings but its approach. \u201cWe have a customer-centric approach . . . an ability to deliver for our customers and to meet their challenges headfirst,\u201d he said.\n\nRealmOne\u2019s breadth of expertise helps it to make good on that promise.\n\n\u201cWe have full coverage of the intelligence lifecycle from end to end: Tasking, collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination,\u201d Lantzy said. \u201cEach one of these plays an integral part in how we support our customers.\u201d\n\nRealmOne has solutions to help the IC collect mission-critical data, along with data scientists who can process that data.\n\n\u201cThen we take that data and exploit it, disseminating it, and getting it into the right hands to make key decisions and real impact on national security,\u201d he said.\n\nLantzy sees plenty of opportunity for growth here. While some federal agencies anticipate a budgetary pause as the new administration lays out its priorities, things appear to be full-steam-ahead in the defense and intel worlds.\n\nIf anything, \u201cthe availability of government funding in intelligence-community related activities is going to expand, and we\u2019re very much going to be a part of that,\u201d he said.\n\nRealmOne is taking a multipronged approach to win its share of that business. First, \u201cwe are expanding within our current customers, embedding ourselves within those specific agencies that we serve today and strengthening our ability to impact those missions,\u201d Lantzy said.\n\nAt the same time, the company is actively looking for opportunities to expand its footprint across adjacent customers.\n\n\u201cA lot of the capabilities and mission-operations support [RealmOne delivers] for our existing customers are things that can be utilized by other agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing able to get our footprint into other customers across the DoD and IC is certainly a focus.\u201d\n\nToday, RealmOne primarily supports the IC, \u201cand a lot of the DoD agencies such as SOCOM and CENTCOM have similar mission sets,\u201d Lantzy said. \u201cWe would love to be delivering our solutions there and supporting mission operations in total.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are challenges, primarily around the competitive nature of the GovCon space. Plenty of agencies need what RealmOne offers. But in practice, \u201copportunity can be limited,\u201d Lantzy said. A GovCon needs to consider: \u201cHave you served that agency in the past? What\u2019s your past performance? Do you have relationships? Do you know what\u2019s upcoming? As you think about procurement, can you build solutions to then replace an incumbent?\u201d\n\nIn this highly competitive landscape, RealmOne puts a heavy emphasis on supporting its individual team members, so they can deliver at the highest possible levels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very much a people-centric business. We have a very strong retention rate here. We recruit very well,\u201d Lantzy said. That approach starts at the top, with leaders who focus on building a strong corporate culture.\n\nSuccess in the GovCon space \u201creally comes from how you treat your people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that their work is challenging, and our leadership supports them as people. We think about flexibility, we think about the benefits that we offer and about \u2018inclusion\u2019 in general. Everybody wants to be a part of something, so that inclusion piece is important.\u201d\n\nLantzy is a relative newcomer to the GovCon space. While he previously supported contractors through financial due diligence in mergers and acquisitions, and he only joined the GovCon world himself five years ago. He said he has found a satisfying fit there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supporting the nation, supporting those who defend our freedom. That\u2019s become a lot clearer for me,\u201d he said.\n\nAs CFO, he sees himself playing an integral role in that effort.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my job to serve our hardworking, dedicated RealmOne team members. I view them as my customers and it\u2019s very important for me that they are getting paid on time, that things are easy for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what keeps me driven.\u201d\n\nIn a service-based industry, he said, \u201cyou always have to think about how you are supporting your people.\u201d",

The gaming handheld experience was perfected by the 1989 Nintendo GameBoy and 1990 Sega GameGear.\n\nWhile gaming PCs and home consoles offer better graphics and performance, gamers love the ability to game anywhere. And who could blame them?\n\nI started my life as a gamer with the GameBoy Color while waiting at doctor's offices and surviving long drives and flights. So the handheld form factor is incredibly nostalgic. But handheld game consoles haven't kept up with the modern gaming market, which is where handheld gaming PCs come in.\n\nThe Claw 8 AI+ leverages Intel's new Lunar Lake mobile processor and integrated Arc 140V graphics to provide a smooth gaming experience held back only by the Windows 11 operating system. The Claw 8 offers frame rates of 30 fps or higher on demanding games like Black Myth: Wukong and Cyberpunk 2077 even without Intel's XeSS frame-generation technology. It's the first Intel handheld that could give the Asus ROG Ally X a run for its money.\n\nThe Claw 8 AI+'s high price point and weight were my primary concerns while reviewing the handheld. At $899, the Claw 8 AI+ was more expensive than the other gaming handhelds on the market. And at 1.75 pounds, it was also on the heavy end with only the Lenovo Legion Go being a heftier handheld.\n\nRecent handheld announcements, like the Lenovo Legion Go 2 concept and Acer Nitro Blaze 11, have made me reconsider. The Legion Go 2 and Nitro Blaze 11 weigh over 2 pounds, and the Blaze 11 is expected to retail for $1,099. We also expect a higher price for the Legion Go 2, as the Legion Go S (Windows 11 version) will retail for $799.\n\nIf not for my predilections for the grind, I would jump at the MSI Claw 8 AI+.\n\nOutlook\n\nMy personal attachment to massive RPGs and lack of impulse control aside, the Claw 8 AI+ is a fantastic choice for a gaming handheld if you're in the market. If you'd rather bet on AMD over Intel, the Asus ROG Ally X is hard to beat.\n\nIf you want to casually play a few games on a flight or during your commute, handheld gaming PCs are a great choice. You run into a few additional snags if you prefer to play online games like an MMO, but even then you can just turn your phone into a mobile hotspot.\n\nBut if you've got no good sense of a gaming life balance, it may be best to avoid handheld gaming PCs entirely. Unless avoiding your family is the point, in which case, I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "High energy costs in the European Union are probably among the main reasons behind the bloc's deindustrialization. Many power-hungry production facilities relocate to Asia because it has become nearly impossible for them to stay competitive with current energy prices. Ireland is not an exception, and this makes Intel very concerned (according to RTE) as it runs its major Fab 34 near Leixlip and has to make sure that the fab produces products at competitive costs. But should Intel really be worried?\n\nIntel's Fab 34 in Ireland is the first production facility in Europe to use extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography to make chips in high volumes. The fab is capable of producing microelectronics using Intel 4 (previously known as 7nm) and Intel 3 (formerly known as 5nm) process technologies and currently produces compute tiles for Intel's Core Ultra 1-series (Meteor Lake on Intel 4) and Xeon 6 processors (Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest on Intel 3). These are premium products.\n\nEnergy prices are rising across the world, in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. However, energy prices are considerably higher in Europe when compared to Asia and the U.S. For example, rates per kWh in the U.S. range from 8.57\u00a2 in Texas to 11.41\u00a2 in Oregon to 12.31\u00a2 in Arizona. By contrast, electricity costs in Ireland vary from 15\u00a2 (night rate) to 26\u00a2 (day rate) for commercial customers. In South Korea and Taiwan, electricity for large commercial users costs 13\u00a2 after increases in late 2024. Therefore, it is more expensive to make chips in Ireland than in the U.S. or Taiwan, at least with respect to energy costs.\n\nEnergy Costs\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 Arizona Ireland Ohio Oregon South Korea Taiwan Texas kWh rate 12.31 \u00a2 15 \u00a2 - 26 \u00a2 10.94 \u00a2 11.41\u00a2 13 \u00a2 13 \u00a2 8.57\u00a2\n\nElectricity cost source links: Arizona, Ireland, South Korea, Taiwan\n\nWhen it comes to multibillion-dollar semiconductor fabrication facilities, the vast majority of their costs are represented by capital expenditures, depreciation, materials, and labor. Utilities, such as electricity, water, and cooling, account for a relatively small \u2014 single-digit to low double-digit percentage \u2014 of microelectronics production costs, according to some industry estimates.\n\nFor example, Intel consumed around 9.1 billion kWh of electricity in 2023, according to the company's Corporate Responsibility Report (CSR). Intel uses green energy across all of its facilities in the U.S., Europe, Israel, and Asia, so its energy prices are a bit higher than those of average businesses. But if we assume that Intel paid 13\u00a2 per kWh on average, then the company paid approximately $1.183 billion for electricity in 2023. Meanwhile, Intel's total revenue in 2023 was $54.2 billion and its total costs were around $32.5 billion (that includes R&D, CapEx, SG&A, depreciation, etc.).\n\nTherefore, energy accounted for 3.64% of Intel's costs and 2.18% of Intel's product revenue. It is plausible to assume that energy costs account for approximately 5% of Intel's product costs, but that probably depends on actual products. For products like Intel's Xeon 6980P, which sells for over $12,000, the contribution of energy costs is probably negligible.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

In fact, a 'senior source' in Davos told RTE that lower labor costs in Ireland are offset by high energy costs. These high costs stem from delays in renewable energy infrastructure and the fixed expenses of offshore wind farms, which are often passed on to customers, RTE claims. To address this, Intel is advocating for the state to assume part of these costs during the development phase to ease the financial burden on manufacturers like itself, the report says.",

If you want to learn more about CPUs before you buy, check out our what is a processor page for more details.\n\nThe best processor overall\n\nThe Intel Core i7-14700K is a heck of a processor to end the LGA 1700 era with, thanks to its very solid performance and excellent price for a midrange processor. It's only a small improvement over its predecessor, but it does pack four additional efficiency cores for better multitasking and freeing up the performance cores to focus on the workloads that need that extra power.\n\nIt also comes with discrete WiFi 7 and Thunderbolt 5 support out the box, and even though those technologies are still a ways away from becoming mainstream, it's nice to have a certain level of future proofing a new processor.\n\nWhile this chip boasts similar performance to the Intel Core i9-13900K, it also has a similar problem managing heat, so you will need the best CPU cooler around to keep this chip from throttling, which is something some i7 users might not have been used to in the past.\n\nRead the full Intel Core i7-14700K review\n\nThe best affordable processor\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe most value-oriented processor in the new AMD Zen 4 lineup is the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X, but don't let its price fool you: this chip is anything but a lightweight. Sure, it can't hold up against the massive, 16-core Ryzen 9 7950X, but its single-core performance is nearly on par with its beefier cousins.\n\nWhat's more, the lack of V-Cache doesn't slow this chip down one bit when it comes to gaming performance, and gamers looking to make the jump to AMD's AM5 platform will find a lot to love about this processor, especially as its more accessible cost helps to offset the cost of a new motherboard and RAM.\n\nFortunately, you won't need a different CPU cooler if you already have one compatible with AM4, and fortunately the Ryzen 5 7600X manages to stay cool under load.\n\nRead the full AMD Ryzen 5 7600X review\n\nThe best processor for performance\n\n(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)\n\nThe Intel Core i9-14900K normally wouldn't be the kind of chip I'd put on this list, given its fairly mild gen-on-gen performance increase, but there's no denying that the 14900K is the fastest chip Intel \u2014 or anyone, really \u2014 has put out.\n\nRight out of the box, this chip is capable of hitting 6.0GHz, something no other consumer processor can do. And while it can only do so under the right conditions, it still counts, and it's why Intel maintains its performance lead over AMD as it heads into a new era next year with a redesigned Meteor Lake processor.\n\nAnd all for the same price as its predecessor, which is a relief given the way inflation has been wrecking havoc around the world.\n\nIt's not without its faults. The 13900K will likely be a better value for you, if you can find it, and this level of performance comes with more heat than any other chip we've ever teted, so make sure you've got the best cooling solution possible.\n\nRead the full Intel Core i9-14900K review\n\nThe best processor for gaming\n\n(Image credit: Future/John Loeffler)\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is easily the best AMD processor on the market for gamers, thanks to its outstanding performance in just about any game you throw at it thanks to its 3D V-Cache technology.\n\nIts non-gaming performance isn't as great, however, so if you're looking for a chip that can do everything, the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X is a great option in this tier, assuming you don't want to go with the Intel Core i7-14700K listed above.\n\nThis is also an expensive chip, though it's somewhat more reasonably priced than the Ryzen 9 7950X3D. If you don't already have an AM5 motherboard though, by wary that you will need to upgrade a lot of components in your PC as well in order to run the new AMD ryzen processors.\n\nRead the full AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D review\n\nThe best processor for AM4 motherboards\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D is - without question - one of the best processors for gaming on the market. With incredible performance thanks to AMD's 3D V-Cache technology, the 5800X3D punches way above its weight class and can even beat out the more expensive Core i9-12900K when it comes to gaming.\n\nSince this is essentially an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X with triple the cache memory thanks to a new microarchitecture that lets AMD 'stack' cache on the CPU die, it keeps the same AM4 motherboard socket as earlier Ryzen chips - meaning that you don't need to spend more to upgrade your motherboard if you're already rocking an AM4 system.\n\nThis is still a last-gen chip though, so you're not going to get all the perks of the AM5 platform like PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 RAM, but if you've got an AM4 system and you want an upgrade but not ready for a total overhual, this is a great chip to carry you for another couple of years at least.\n\nRead the full AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D review\n\nThe best processor for LGA 1200 motherboards\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n6. Intel Core i5-11600K High-performance at an accessible price Our expert review: Specifications Cores: 6 Threads: 12 Base clock: 3.9GHz Boost clock: 4.9GHz L3 cache: 12MB TDP: 125W Today's Best Deals View at Amazon Check Walmart Reasons to buy + Great gaming performance + Accessible price Reasons to avoid - Runs hot - Requires more power\n\nIntel's 11th-gen processors generally weren't much to celebrate, given that they didn't provide all that much of a gen-on-gen performance increase. But the Core i5-11600K is a noteable exception, providing outstanding performance for the price, making it a great chip to upgrade to if you are still using an Intel LGA 1200 system.\n\nYou won't be able to take advantage of the latest PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 RAM, however, and the i5-11600K's performance comes at the cost of power consumption and heat, which might require you to upgrade your CPU cooler to compensate. This might possibly even mean upgrading to an AIO cooler, whereas earlier generations could get away with air cooling.\n\nStill, if you're not ready just yet to make the jump to Intel's 12th- or 13th-gen chips \u2014 especially if you are waiting for Intel's 14th-gen chips, which will use a whole new LGA 1851 socket.\n\nRead the full Intel Core i5-11600K review\n\nHow we test processors\n\nIt's impossible to tell the best processors from the worst just by looking at them. All of the core components are hidden away in near-identical packaging, and even if you were to peel back that packaging, the transistors on the CPU die are literally measured in nanometers. How can you tell a million transistors on a chip from a billion, and how can you measure a processor's clock cycle by looking at the box?\n\nFortunately, there are tests we can run to see how well a processor performs in the real world, and the best way to do that is to push a processor to its limits by running finely-calibrated benchmarking tools that produce comparable scores based on how well a processor performed a specific task - like compressing a video file, or performing the complex math used for 3D gaming.\n\nWe use industry-standard tools like Geekbench 6, Cinebench R24, and PCMark 10 to synthetically push processors to the limit using realistic workloads that you're likely to experience in day-to-day use.\n\nWe also use modern PC games set to the lowest graphical settings on the best available gaming hardware to isolate CPU performance while gaming, which we measure in frames per second.\n\nThen, with the scores in hand, we look at the price of the processor. The best processors offer either best-in-class performance regardless of price, or compelling value for the customer. We won't score a CPU highly if its performance is just fine but it's out of reach for most people's budgets.\n\nFor more information, see How We Test.",

This movement enables users to repair and upgrade their machines without being penalized by technology companies through restrictions on getting components or tools to make the repairs.\n\nWhile modular laptop concepts aren't new \u2014 Framework has been making modular laptops for years, and Asus will soon release ROG Strix Scar 16 and 18 laptops \u2014 this new approach from Intel has one key differentiator: It's open source, meaning anyone can use the research materials to make their own laptops and PCs.\n\nWhat is Intel's Modular PC paper about?\n\nIntel's proposed modular motherboard and IO ports in laptops with fan-less, single-fan, and dual-fan designs. | Credit: Intel\n\nIntel's modular design would separate the existing laptop motherboard from an all-in-one solution into a three-segment design with the motherboard and SoC (system-on-a-chip) separate from the IO ports. This would allow for an easier repair and upgrade process.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This innovative structure allows for targeted upgrades, repairs, and replacements, significantly extending the device's lifespan and reducing electronic waste.\"\n\nIntel's proposal reads, in part, \"Modular PC architecture breaks from the traditional all-in-one motherboard design, opting instead for a system where key components are categorized into individual, interchangeable modules.\n\nThis innovative structure allows for targeted upgrades, repairs, and replacements, significantly extending the device's lifespan and reducing electronic waste.\"\n\nIntel also proposed a modular mini-PC design, separating the components into standardized modules, similar to the proposed laptop design.\n\nAs the Intel blog purports, the purpose of all this is to \"significantly extend the usable life of computing devices, thereby reducing electronic waste and promoting a more sustainable consumption model.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"By working closely with our customers and partners, we hope to transform the way PCs are designed and help shape the future of computing.\"\n\nWhat makes Intel's proposal different from existing modular laptops like Framework?\n\nCredit: Framework\n\nFor the last couple of generations of Framework designs, like the Framework Laptop 16 in 2023, the company has even created swappable motherboards and replaceable displays to repair or upgrade the laptop.\n\nHowever, Framework is just one company. Intel's design plan attempts to open-source modular laptop and mini-PC designs.\n\nThe pro proposal is more like the desktop format approach. In contrast, PC-building enthusiasts can choose parts from different manufacturers and put them in the same PC thanks to format standardizations like ATX, DTX, Micro ATX, and Mini ITX.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntel pioneered the ATX and Micro ATX motherboard and power supply formats. However, companies like IBM, SSI, VIA, and AMD created many standardized motherboard form factors.\n\nWhen could we see modular laptops and mini PCs take over?\n\nIn contrast to other modular laptop implementations, Intel's proposal is more of an open-source solution. Intel doesn't manufacture devices, just some PC components. So this design would need to be adopted by Intel's laptop and mini-PC partners.\n\nThat means it could be a while before we see manufacturers like Dell, Asus, or Lenovo utilizing Intel's modular motherboard and I/O designs to create modular laptops and mini-PCs.\n\nConsidering the time it takes to engineer and build new laptops and mini-PCs, the earliest we could expect to see parts of this modular concept would be about a year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven Intel Co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus's confirmation at CES that \"Panther Lake\" is already in testing, we might see modular laptops and mini-PCs built with a mobile variant of that SoC.

            "content": "While several chip stocks had convincing performances in 2024, Intel (INTC 0.85%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 2.25%) were not among them. Intel shares fell about 60% last year, while AMD shares were down about 18%.\n\nLet's examine which semiconductor stock looks like the better rebound candidate in 2025.\n\nAI afterthoughts\n\nIn a semiconductor market largely being driven by artificial intelligence (AI), Intel and AMD have largely been afterthoughts. AMD is the distant No. 2 designer of graphic processing units (GPUs) behind market leader Nvidia. Intel's market share in GPUs, meanwhile, has dropped to zero, although it wasn't a far fall, with the company having just a 2% market share in PC graphics cards in 2023.\n\nAMD has struggled against Nvidia, largely due to its inferior software. In a recent study, SemiAnalysis called AMD's out-of-the-box GPUs \"unusable\" for AI training, noting it needed \"multiple teams of AMD engineers\" to help it fix software bugs. However, AMD has been able to carve out a niche in AI inference, with SemiAnalysis saying its customers typically use AMD's GPUs for narrow, well-defined inference use cases.\n\nNonetheless, AMD has been able to see strong data center growth, albeit not nearly at the same scale as Nvidia. Last quarter, it saw its data center revenue surge 122% year over year and 25% sequentially to $3.5 billion. The company credited both its Instinct GPUs and EPYC central processing units (CPUs) for the jump in sales.\n\nCPUs act as the brain of a computer, while GPUs have superior processing power. While there is a lot of deserved attention on GPUs, AMD has been doing a good jump in the CPU market, noting that it has been taking share in the CPU server market while it also has been doing well in the PC market.\n\nOverall, AMD saw its Q3 revenue climb 18% to $6.8 billion and its adjusted EPS jump 31% to $0.92. So the company has still been growing nicely despite the dip in its stock price.\n\nIntel, on the other hand, saw its revenue decline last quarter by 6% to $13.3 billion, and its adjusted EPS flip to a loss of -$0.46 versus a profit of $0.41 a year ago. The one bright spot last quarter was its data center and AI segment, which saw revenue rise 9% to $3.3 billion. However, when compared to Nvidia and AMD, that is a very modest gain in this segment.\n\nMeanwhile, its largest segment, Client Computing, saw its revenue drop 7% to $7.3 billion. By comparison, AMD saw its Client segment revenue surge 29% last quarter to $1.9 billion, showing it's making some inroads on Intel's primary PC business.\n\nPerhaps Intel's biggest woes, though, stem from its Foundry segment, which has been a big drag on its results. The company has poured money into this business through capital expenditures (capex), building out new manufacturing facilities. However, the segment has been a consistently large money loser, including reporting a $5.8 billion operating loss last quarter, or $2.7 billion when excluding a noncash impairment charge.\n\nFollowing the exit of its CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel has said it could look to spin off its foundry business. The business recently received $7.86 billion in direct funding and a 25% investment tax credit from the government to continue to build out its manufacturing footprint in the U.S.\n\nValuations and verdict\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Intel is the cheaper stock, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 12.6 times versus 17.6 times for AMD.\n\nHowever, if you separately value Intel's core business and its foundry business, its valuation is even more attractive.\n\nIntel's foundry business has been losing lots of money, but it also has a lot of physical assets. Intel has spent $68.5 billion in capex, mostly on the foundry business, since the end of 2021 and has $104 billion in physical assets on its balance sheet. If you take just its recent capex spending and subtract out its $26 billion in net debt, its foundry business would be worth about $10 per share on 4.3 billion in shares. It also owns an 88% stake in Mobileye, which is worth about $11.4 billion, or $2.66 per Intel share.\n\nAs such, it is no surprise that the company has been the subject of takeover rumors. There are a lot of hidden physical assets not reflected in its share price, not to mention the government's direct funding and tax incentive.\n\nAMD, meanwhile, has certainly been the stronger of the two businesses, although it hasn't gotten the investor respect it may deserve. If more AI infrastructure turns toward AI inference, it could be in a good place. Meanwhile, investors shouldn't overlook its CPU business, which has been gaining share both in data centers and PCs.\n\nI like both stock as turnaround candidates this year. I like Intel slightly more because of the deep value I think is still in the stock. However, AMD also looks like a solid rebound candidate. Fortunately, investors don't have to choose and can add both stocks to their portfolios if they choose.",

            "content": "\ufeffIntel recently announced that publisher 2K would partner with it to launch its Intel Builder Bundle. This bundle now includes a copy of Firaxis-developed Sid Meier's Civilization VII alongside the previously bundled Assassin's Creed Shadows for purchasers of qualifying Intel desktop CPUs, namely 14th Generation Raptor Lake or Core Ultra 200S (Arrow Lake) CPUs.\n\nBoth bundled games are upcoming releases, with Civilization VII slated for a February 11 release and Civilization VII to release on March 20. The bundle itself will be redeemable on qualifying purchases made before March 31 until May 15, with games being provided as download codes on or after the release date, depending on the date of purchase.\n\nAs emphasized by Intel, Civilization VII will launch with day-one support for Intel XeSS upscaling and scheduling optimizations in collaboration with developer Firaxis Games for Intel Core and Intel Core Ultra CPUs. That and Intel's generally good gaming CPU performance (although AMD's Ryzen 9000X3D CPUs seem to take the gaming crown lately) should make Intel systems with this promo a pretty good choice for Civilization VII, especially for those whose much higher system requirements may push into upgrading.\n\nSuppose you focus solely on gaming as a PC builder and hope to use this Civilization VII and Civilization VII bundle. We recommend opting for a 14th-generation CPU over an Intel Core 200S CPU. The Arrow Lake-based Intel Core Ultra 9 285K indicates a generational drop in gaming performance, which could make a 14th Generation Core i7 or Core i9 a much better choice for gaming-centric PC builders. At this point, chips like Core Ultra 9 285K only make sense for productivity-centric users despite being the newest from Intel.\n\nIn any case, those opting for a competitive Intel CPU covered with this bundle (14th Gen recommended) and with a mid-range modern GPU should have a pretty good gaming experience with these two bundled games upon release. If you were planning your next PC build around Intel and wanted these games anyway, acting before March 31 should be a nice way to save the additional $140 before taxes you'd be paying for both of those games standalone.",

Such models are primarily intended to cater to the domestic markets and are mostly \"F\" variants, which come without any iGPU onboard. Similarly, MyDrivers has showcased Intel's Core Ultra 5 230F, revealing the model's specifications, the new \"exclusive\" packaging, and the IHS design.\n\nStarting with the specifications, Intel's Core Ultra 5 230F features a 10-core layout, with six P-Cores and four E-Cores, coming in with a maximum turbo frequency of 5.0 GHz, credit to the performance cores onboard. Along with this, the processor comes with a TDP of 65W, along with a 24 MB cache. You can place this model in the mid-range market segment since it comes with a good spot in the Core Ultra 5 lineup, although this variant will be limited to only Chinese markets.\n\nImage Credits: MyDrivers\n\nThis particular model is pretty consistent in terms of the onboard specifications of other counterparts in the Arrow Lake-S lineup, but Intel has only switched up the core clock speeds and cache size, which is likely to provide a more appealing option to the domestic markets. There are also images of the new packaging for China-compliant ARL-S CPUs, and it looks like a mere recolor of the original box, with little to no changes apart from the SKU's name and the text written on the box.\n\nFor pricing, the Intel Core Ultra 5 230F retails at 1,999 yuan/$276 at the Chinese retailer JD, which certainly makes it one of the low-priced Arrow Lake-S SKUs out there. Whether global availability will be there is unconfirmed for now, but we often see such models end up at system integrators, so that's something to look out for.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 8 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently broke down the market\u2019s performance on Tuesday, discussing how President Donald Trump\u2019s early days in office might be influencing investor sentiment. He speculated that the stock rally could be tied to a belief among investors that Trump\u2019s promises on tariffs may be harsher than his actual actions, leading to optimism.\n\nCramer pointed out that during Trump\u2019s first presidency, investors learned to buy stocks during moments of market volatility caused by his aggressive rhetoric. He noted that Trump\u2019s frequent saber-rattling would often prompt sell-offs, but those moments, when stocks of companies he criticized dropped, turned out to be prime opportunities to invest.\n\nCramer explained that this pattern of buying the dips was exactly what played out on Tuesday. After months of discussing high tariffs, Trump\u2019s inaugural speech struck a more tempered tone, and he avoided threatening severe trade barriers. According to Cramer, this shift in rhetoric surprised many, especially given how aggressive his stance had been in the past.\n\n\u201cMaybe four years is a long time ago, but people seem to forget the Trump drill. The president loves the stock market. He always loves to send signals that all hell is going to break loose and when it doesn\u2019t, well guess what? The market flies.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed 9 Stocks for This Week\u2019s Game Plan and 9 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar\n\nCramer also suggested that this latest market rally is driven by the prospect of tariffs, especially on tariffs that are smaller than initially forecasted. He mentioned that these could increase if foreign countries don\u2019t comply with U.S. demands. Furthermore, Cramer highlighted the role of new projects such as Stargate, an AI infrastructure initiative backed by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. He noted that this project, which will involve new data centers likely outfitted with Nvidia technology, was another contributing factor to the market\u2019s upbeat performance. Cramer noted that the presence of major tech leaders at the inauguration further reinforced optimism.\n\n\u201cWill it stay this way? What did we learn about Trump the first time around? You could never be sure. The difference on day one? He knows business people, Silicon Valley. He knows how things work. You may like him. You may hate him. But the bottom line? If you\u2019re a tech titan, Trump will take your call. In fact, he\u2019ll call you. Biden, I don\u2019t know if he knew who they even were and he certainly didn\u2019t bother to call them. In the end, I think he preferred to sue them. If you own stocks, which is why you watch me, Trump\u2019s method is a heck of a lot better for your portfolio.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 21. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 68\n\nDiscussing Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) during the episode, Cramer said:\n\n\u201cCouple of semiconductor names like Applied Materials, which make semiconductor capital equipment, and even the lowly Intel both also roughly 12% higher thanks to the amazing quarter (of Taiwan Semiconductor)\u2026 Even lowly worm Intel managed to become one of the five best-performing stocks\u2026 up more than 12% and many other chip plays had huge gains, especially the semiconductor capital equipment names.\u201d\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) develops and produces computing products such as processors, memory, and AI solutions. Since TSMC released its earnings results on January 16, Intel\u2019s stock is up over 7%. Explaining why Intel and other stocks in the group experienced gains because of TSMC, Cramer said:\n\n\u201cNow, like I said earlier, the pin action from this Taiwan Semi quarter was extensive, but some of the biggest beneficiaries were the semiconductor capital equipment companies that, well, these are huge, huge makers of equipment that Taiwan Semi buys\u2026 So why did Taiwan Semi quarter spark such a big rally for the semi capital equipment sector? Simple: In addition to all of its bullish revenue and margin guidance for the first quarter of 2025 and the positive commentary about its long-term revenue growth potential, Taiwan Semi also disclosed its capital equipment budget for full year 2025. It was enormous.\n\nCramer highlighted that TSMC plans to invest between $38 billion and $42 billion in capital expenditures this year, marking an increase of 28% to 41% from the previous year. This spending forecast surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectation of $36.4 billion. Cramer pointed out that TSMC\u2019s management emphasized that higher capital spending often signals greater growth potential in the years to come, a statement that Cramer believes shows the company\u2019s strategic foresight. He also noted that this strong outlook for capital equipment investment is one of the reasons why semiconductor capital equipment stocks have been gaining momentum recently.\n\nOverall, INTC ranks 4th on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar. While we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than INTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Hey everybody Peter Zeihan here today we\u2019re going to talk about the semiconductor sector, specifically the American company Intel. Now Intel has had a rough few years. 20 years, ten years ago, 20 or 25 years ago, they used to be the industry leader, and they were so far ahead that they would release designs that were nowhere near the most sophisticated, because they knew it would take forever to the market to catch up.\n\nSo they had years of work plan in front of them. Unfortunately, they rested on their laurels and they failed to invest in the technology called extreme ultraviolet that instead a Taiwanese from TSMC picked up on, which allowed for much faster fabrication and much more accuracy. Much less waste. And in a few years, TSMC overtook Intel become the world leader.\n\nIntel did get on the extreme ultraviolet bandwagon eventually, but it took them a while to master the technology, and they\u2019ve been behind ever since. Now, that said, the semiconductor industry is really weird and that we really do only have that one world leader, TSMC, that makes almost all of the high end chips. Intel is trying to catch up from behind.\n\nAnd Samsung out of Korea has picked up some fabrication facilities, from a merger and is doing their best to play, but they\u2019re a distant, distant, distant, distant, distant distant second. So I thought it would be worth understanding where this technology is going to evolve and where the corporations are going to evolve. American politicians like to focus on the fabrication facilities, the places where the semiconductors are actually, grown, attached, doped and, built.\n\nBut that\u2019s really not the hard part of the process. I mean, know, no offense to the fabricators. They do amazing work in difficult condition and technologically challenging fields, but the harder work is in design. A basic design for a high end chip can take upwards of 24 months to really get going, and that\u2019s assuming you\u2019re not really incorporating any fundamentally new technology into it.\n\nAnd most of this design work is done in the United States, with a lesser degree in Japan, but that makes it sound like it\u2019s just some guy with a protractor basically scribbling on paper. And that\u2019s not what it is. You\u2019re bringing together literally tens of thousands of elements into a design to try to do something new, process faster, manage heat better, use electricity, use less electricity, use different materials, and so on.\n\nAnd all the new technologies have to be incorporated into this theoretical construct, which is then taken to Taiwan, where they work with TSMC in order to basically make an instruction booklet that the TSMC staff will follow. And then you have to worry about all of the inputs coming from around the world, because it\u2019s not like you just take some silicon and you\u2019re off to the races.\n\nNo no no no no no. There\u2019s copper, there\u2019s palladium. There\u2019s all kinds of different inputs, things like transistors that have to be very, very specially designed and produced. TSMC doesn\u2019t do any of that. The logistics and the design companies in the United States do so even today, with TSMC producing 90% of the world\u2019s high end chips. Most of the real work, most of the value added work, most of the high paying jobs are actually done in the United States, and operating a side facility while it\u2019s still highly skilled work.\n\nIt\u2019s not nearly as highly skilled as what happens on the other side of the Pacific. The problem that brings me back to Intel is what happens on the other side of the equation, once you have all of your raw semiconductors, you then break them into their individual components and test them and package them. And then you have to put them into an intermediate product, like a motherboard or a memory drive or, a chip within a sensor system.\n\nAnd only then can you go into the proper manufacturing process where it is put into a car or a plane or a satellite or whatever else. So this one step fabrication, obviously unavoidable, obviously important, but it\u2019s not really where the money is. Now, TSMC is a little obsessed with its security because it is a Taiwanese company. And you can understand why.\n\nAnd so the concern a lot of people have in the sector and more broadly is that if something happens to Taiwan, we lose all the iron semiconductors, and that is true. But if something happens to South Africa, we lose a lot of the rare materials that go into it. If something happens in North Carolina, we lose the ability to purify the silicon that goes into it.\n\nGod forbid something happens to San Jose, we lose the ability to do a lot of the software work on the back end. There are thousands of single point failures throughout the system. What makes Intel unique, from my point of view, is that they have a number of these other steps under the umbrella. There are still literally thousands of single point failures throughout the Intel system, but probably about a third to have less than what TSMC has.\n\nSo in a world that is on the verge of rapid globalization, the idea that we\u2019re going to be able to make these high end chips at all is kind of a stretch to me, because there\u2019s just too many places where a single break means the whole thing falls apart. But Intel has three advantages. Number one, more of the steps are under the umbrella.\n\nNumber two, its fab facilities are in the United States. And number three, if we\u2019re going to have to rebuild this environment anyway, easier to do it if you only have to replace 3000 steps instead of 4500. So one way or another, regardless of the corporate success or failure of Intel in the months and years ahead. The fact that more of this stuff is concentrated in Intel and in the United States suggests that some version of Intel is actually going to be a bigger part of the semiconductor future globally than TSMC over the long run.\n\nOf course, we\u2019re all dead in the long run. So this is all about timing.",

            "content": "Intel has proposed a shift to a more modular architecture for personal computers both portable and desk-bound, highlighting the benefits of reversing the trend for components to be soldered to motherboards in terms of reducing electronic waste and improving repairability \u2014 though it has not announced any plans to actually produce such a system, at least at present.\n\n\"The right-to-repair emphasizes the importance of being able to fix and upgrade PCs on one's own,\" Intel's Curpreet Sandhu, Reshma PP, and Roberta Zouain explain in a joint post on the topic. \"Improving repairability requires fundamental changes starting from the design methodology. Compliant devices will need to guarantee, by design, repairability and upgradability. This approach requires a modular PC architecture which is deviant from the current monolithic approach. Modular PC architecture is an innovative approach that addresses this requirement of end-of-life extension with the flexibility to upgrade and repair their systems with ease.\"\n\nIntel is looking to reverse the trend towards monolithic systems, proposing a return to the days when PCs were more modular. (\ud83d\udcf7: Intel)\n\nWhen IBM released its Personal Computer (PC) back in 1981, the design was notably modular \u2014 and based, more for reasons of expediency than philanthropy, around a standardized architecture. As a result, there was nothing to stop third parties from building devices designed to upgrade or repair an IBM PC or even cloning the PC itself \u2014 something that a vast number of companies did, launching the \"IBM compatible\" market, which effectively birthed modern computing as we know it today.\n\nA growing desire for small-and-light, coupled with the need to trim profit margins, means manufacturers have been moving away from this modular approach. Open a modern laptop and you'll most likely find a compact single-board computer with absolutely no components you can replace without access to a hot-air soldering station \u2014 notable exceptions like the MNT Reform family and Framework Laptop range aside.\n\nIntel's concept owes much to companies like MNT and Framework, who already offer modular portables. (\ud83d\udcf7: Intel)\n\nIntel's proposal leans more towards the latter than the former, and in fact directly lifts Framework's use of compact daughterboards for input/output connectivity as one of its proposals. Others include a return to motherboards that host removable storage and memory, though stops short of recommending socketed and user-replaceable CPUs and GPUs for portable devices where size and weight matter most.\n\nIntel's proposal splits the market into three: the Premium Modular PC Architecture is, effectively, its take on the Framework Laptop, putting two modular input/output boards either side of a central motherboard \u2014 with all models in the range using the same standardized IO modules. The Entry/Mainstream Modular PC Architecture, meanwhile, extends the concept still further by promising an \"upgradeable core,\" memory, Wi-Fi, and solid-state storage \u2014 again, like the Framework Laptop family.\n\nFinally, the company's Desktop Modular PC Architecture is, effectively, a successor to its shuttered Next Unit of Computing (NUC) project: compact workstations that, like current desktops, can accept discrete PCI Express GPUs and other add-in boards \u2014 but which connect to the mainboard through a central Platform Controller Hub (PCH), and feature slide rails similar to vintage PCs of the 1980s. Another design tweak is removable solid-state storage accessed from the front panel, inspired by games consoles.\n\nIntel's concept even extends to the desktop, albeit focused more on small form factor systems than already-modular full-size desktops. (\ud83d\udcf7: Intel)\n\n\"By developing a new approach to system design that allows for easy upgrades and component replacements,\" the trio claim, \"we aim to significantly extend the usable life of computing devices, thereby reducing electronic waste and promoting a more sustainable consumption model. By working closely with our customers and partners, we hope to transform the way PCs are designed and help shape the future of computing.\"\n\nAt the time of writing, however, neither Intel nor its partners had committed to actually producing any devices based around the concept, which is detailed in full on the company's blog.",

            "content": "Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust\n\nForward-looking: Outdated laptops often necessitate complete replacements since they typically only allow users to upgrade memory or storage. Intel aims to address this issue by urging manufacturers to embrace new modular design standards. Like Framework and MNT PCs, these standards would allow users to upgrade motherboards and other components without purchasing a new laptop.\n\nIntel recently outlined its ideas for allowing users to upgrade and replace individual laptop components. If widely adopted, the new standards could reduce costs and e-waste.\n\nThe company's proposal describes standardized measurements for future laptop motherboards and I/O modules. Following a clear set of parameters might speed up the design process for new components.\n\nAdditionally, users could upgrade and replace boards, USB-C ports, Thunderbolt ports, and other parts without completely replacing the laptop. An affordable tier for mainstream laptops would accommodate 14- and 16-inch devices, enabling single- or dual-fan upgrades to improve cooling.\n\nIntel also envisions strengthening modularity and standardization for mini-PCs. The company's diagram (below) depicts a 5L chassis with slide rails to facilitate easy swapping of the CPU, memory, GPU, and storage. The I/O ports and other parts would also enable easy repairs.\n\nFramework and MNT have provided modular laptops for years, but their initiatives remain niche. Framework's products allow customers to swap mainboards, ports, screens, keyboards, and many other components. The company also aims to provide upgradeable dedicated graphics for its 16-inch laptop, but the AMD Radeon RX 7700S is the only available option so far.\n\nMeanwhile, MNT recently unveiled the successor to its Arm-based Reform laptop. Owners of the prior model can upgrade to a new SoC, swap other components, and 3D print a new chassis.\n\nThe primary downside of Framework and MNT devices is that upgrades require users to remain within each company's hardware ecosystem. In contrast, Intel's proposal could potentially create an environment resembling desktop DIY PCs, allowing users to choose between parts from numerous vendors. However, whether the industry would agree upon a single modular laptop standard remains uncertain.\n\nWide adoption wouldn't just lower upgrade costs and reduce e-waste; it would also deliver right-to-repair advocates a major victory. The increasingly popular movement aims to resist manufacturers' efforts to block repairs and maintenance by users or third-party hardware vendors. Right-to-repair advocacy usually centers on machines like smartphones and tractors, but laptop users have also begun complaining about recent models that no longer allow RAM and SSD upgrades.",

            "content": "Exclusive: Intel Boosts 2025 Partner Funding, Cuts Direct Partner Coverage\n\nIn his first interview as Intel\u2019s new global channel chief, Dave Guzzi explains how the chipmaker is increasing partner funding in 2025 as well as why it\u2019s reducing direct partner coverage, changing its market development funds model and narrowing its ISV focus to AI.\n\nAfter exploring cuts within Intel\u2019s global partner programs last year, the semiconductor giant is increasing funding for partner incentives and investments in 2025 while reducing its direct partner coverage, Intel Global Channel Chief Dave Guzzi told CRN.\n\nGuzzi disclosed the changes to Intel\u2019s partner programs, which will also include a forthcoming shift in how it deploys market development funds, in his first interview as the new vice president of Intel\u2019s Global Partner Scale organization.\n\n[Related: Intel\u2019s US Channel Chief To Lead New North America Partner Group: Exclusive]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually increasing our funding for partners in 2025 over what we invested in 2024. That's a massive commitment to the channel,\u201d said Guzzi, who took over as Intel\u2019s global channel chief from Trevor Vickers in October as his parent division, the Sales and Marketing Group (SMG), underwent deep spending cuts and a reorganization.\n\n\u201cI think that will give us and our partners some wind in our sails at the same time that we've got some really cool products coming out,\u201d he added, citing products like Intel\u2019s Core Ultra chips for AI PCs as well as the Xeon processors for data center inference workloads.\n\nHowever, the funding increase is happening at the same time Guzzi\u2019s group reduced coverage by an unspecified amount of channel partners and non-AI ISVs. For impacted channel partners, this means they will no longer work with an Intel salesperson for Intel-related matters and will instead have to rely on distributors for such things.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much just a financial expansion of the existing programs, in some cases, with a smaller number of partners, which means, of course, there\u2019s even more money available to each of those that are still participating,\u201d he said last week.\n\nGuzzi also disclosed that Intel about a year ago reduced the number of authorized distributors it works with by an unspecified amount in the company\u2019s Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Asia-Pacific Japan (APJ); and China regions.\n\nThe changes in partner funding and coverage were made after SMG was told to cut more than 35 percent in costs last August as part of Intel\u2019s larger initiative to slash more than 15,000 jobs, or 15 percent of its total workforce, and over $10 billion in costs in response to worsening financial conditions, as CRN exclusively reported.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to free up both our people and our money to be able to be more invested in things that we thought were the highest value and would give Intel the greatest return,\u201d Guzzi said.\n\nAs Intel\u2019s new global channel chief, Guzzi is a relative newcomer to the company, having only joined in 2021 as general manager of global channel sales before moving to become vice president of global distribution and partner sales early last year.\n\nHowever, he previously served on Intel\u2019s U.S. Channel Board of Advisors for more than nine years, including as its president, while he worked in leadership positions at solution provider companies such as Equus Compute Solutions and Dedicated Computing.\n\n\u201cI spent 30 years in the channel before joining Intel, and I have huge respect for channel partners, because their jobs, in many ways, are far more complex than any of the individual suppliers\u2019 responsibilities,\u201d Guzzi said.\n\nWhat Increased Partner Funding Means\n\nWhile Guzzi said Intel is increasing funding in 2025 for partner investment and incentive programs, he and a company spokesperson declined to say how much funding has been set aside this year or by what percentage the funding increased from 2024.\n\n\u201cAll of our key partners know how difficult this has been for Intel as we invest in foundry, as we don't have the margins we used to have, etc. So we have less free cash to operate with, but at that very time, we've decided to increase our partner investments year on year,\u201d he said.\n\nWhereas Intel puts incentives in place to reward partners after they achieve certain outcomes with the company\u2019s products, investments are made in partners upfront for co-marketing and co-selling activities, according to Guzzi.\n\n\u201cWe believe they will go out and create demand for our products. So we commit that money to them up front, and then we are the co-investor in them and help make sure that they actually win, so that then we get a return on that investment,\u201d he said.\n\nHow these funds are used depend on the partner type, according to Guzzi.\n\nFor distributors, partner funding is used in two ways: to help \u201cdrive the sales of CPUs into companies that manufacture PCs\u201d and to encourage the sales of Intel-based systems from OEMs such as Dell Technologies, HP Inc. and Lenovo.\n\nFor systems integrators, the type of funding depends on their business model. For some, the funding may be used for non-recurring engineering funds to help them create products and solutions with Intel\u2019s chips. In other cases, funding can be used for winning large customer deals through systems integrators when Intel is faced with a competitive bid.\n\nThen there\u2019s market development funds and sales development funds, which are used to create demand for Intel-based products and solutions, generate leads on customers and then help partners close deals for such products and solutions.\n\nGuzzi said these kinds of activities are meant to help partners develop, market and sell Intel-based solutions in profitable ways.\n\n\u201cWe recognize the importance of helping defray the investment cost to create the solutions in the first place, seek out the opportunities, drive it all the way through their own sales process, and then, in the end, meet the financial requirements for their customers to say yes, so we try to help along the way,\u201d he said.\n\nAn executive at a national systems integrator said he is glad to see Intel increase partner funding because he has witnessed firsthand AMD\u2019s growing influence in the channel.\n\nThe executive, who asked not to be named to speak frankly, recalled telling an Intel channel executive months ago, \u201cAMD is paying significantly to basically gain influence with our sales teams, and you guys just don't want to do anything. So I don't know what else to tell you, either match it or don't, but that\u2019s how this is going.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey're just waking up to the fact that AMD\u2019s starting to eat at us, and it is working,\u201d the systems integrator executive said.\n\n\u2018Significant\u2019 Change Coming To Intel\u2019s MDF Program\n\nAs part of the changes Guzzi\u2019s team is making to Intel\u2019s global partner programs, the channel executive said the company plans to make a \u201csignificant shift\u201d in how the company reimburses partners for MDF activities in the first quarter.\n\nHistorically, Intel\u2019s MDF model has been compliance-based, according to Guzzi. This translated into the chipmaker reimbursing partners for spending a pre-approved amount of money on marketing activities related to Intel\u2019s products.\n\nWith the forthcoming change, Intel is moving to an outcome-based MDF model, where partners must prove that they achieved certain goals, like generating customer leads, for pre-approved marketing opportunities before they get reimbursed by Intel.\n\n\u201cWhat we're looking at doing instead is holding ourselves and our partners accountable to, \u2018Well, what do we actually get out of that spend?\u2019 and being less worried about, \u2018What vendor did you use for this, show me a copy of the receipt,\u2019 and being much more focused on, \u2018What result did we get out of it? How many leads did you generate?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThis change in how Intel reimburses MDF projects will shift the impetus on generating customer leads from Intel to its partners, according to Guzzi.\n\n\u201cVery specifically, we might move to a model where, instead of our partners expecting us to create leads, we supply funds to them so that\u2014because they're experts in the markets they serve, whether it's geographic or segments\u2014they then spend that money and they create leads with the money that we're investing with them,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Guzzi admitted that it\u2019s \u201cgoing to take a little time for partners to fully embrace that\u201d because large vendors like Intel have historically handled lead generation, he believes it\u2019s a better way forward for both the semiconductor giant and the channel.\n\n\u201cMy view is that they really know their markets, and we would rather invest in them where they think it's best, and then let's see what you can do to create leads for both of us,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of this big Intel company that makes CPUs trying to create demand for a solution in a particular segment in a certain region or [geography].\u201d\n\nMultiple partners said this move falls in line with what they have seen at other vendors.\n\n\u201cHaving this be outcome-based is a great move. They shouldn\u2019t be spending their money on companies that just check the box,\u201d said Christopher Cyr, CTO at North Sioux City, S.D.-based Sterling, which is No. 54 on CRN\u2019s 2024 Solution Provider 500 list.\n\nAsked whether this change will result in Intel partners receiving roughly the same amount of money for MDF reimbursements on average, Guzzi said it will \u201cprobably be comparable.\u201d\n\nHowever, the global channel chief said, he would like to see partners \u201cthink through entire campaigns rather than individual activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hope, as time evolves, that partners would do fewer bigger campaigns that were more comprehensive and then fewer individual activities that might be a bit one-off,\u201d he said.\n\nIntel Narrows ISV Investment Focus To AI\n\nWhen Guzzi\u2019s group was faced with a mandate to make cuts, his team decided to narrow the company\u2019s investments in ISVs to those whose primary focus is AI.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we did is in our ISV investments, we decided that we really needed to narrow [it] down to just AI,\u201d Guzzi said.\n\nThis means Intel\u2019s Global Partner Scale organization will stop investments in other ISV areas, like security, the global channel chief said.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s a] critical market, no doubt about it, but for our work, we felt that to execute against the best opportunities with our channel partners, AI today was going to make the most sense for us for some of the broader ISVs,\u201d Guzzi said.\n\nThe move to focus on AI ISVs was celebrated by several partners, including Mike Trojecki, senior director of AI practice at St. Louis, Mo.-based systems integrator World Wide Technology, No. 7 on CRN\u2019s 2024 Solution Provider 500.\n\n\u201cIf they're saying they're focusing on the AI side of the house from an ISV standpoint, that's exciting for us, because that's a key growth area for us,\u201d said Trojecki, who added that \u201csome of these ISVs [will] be a critical part of the solutions we offer.\u201d\n\nGuzzi nor an Intel spokesperson declined to identify other ISV areas impacted by the company\u2019s reduction in partner coverage.\n\n\u201cWhile security remains a cornerstone, Intel has moved away from one-off custom software optimizations for niche applications, focusing instead on scalable solutions that benefit a wider range of partners,\u201d the Intel spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOn that note, partnerships for workloads with minimal growth potential or limited alignment with Intel's roadmap, such as legacy or highly specialized use cases, have been scaled back,\u201d the representative added.\n\nIntel Reduces Direct Partner Coverage\n\nGuzzi suggested that Intel has also reduced its direct coverage of channel partners by an unspecified amount but offered few details.\n\n\u201cThere's probably a fewer number of accounts that are covered when we had this downsizing. We certainly lost some sales folks, and so there may be some customers that were directly covered in the past that won't be now,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a follow-up response, an Intel spokesperson said, \u201cany adjustments in covered partners are part of a strategy to enhance efficiency and effectiveness across the ecosystem\u201d when it came to systems integrators, channel builders and the broad channel.\n\n\u201cThese decisions are made to ensure Intel and its partners are well-positioned for mutual growth and success in a rapidly evolving market landscape. After all, our partner and regional ecosystem\u2014 and how we drive their success\u2014is a priority for Intel as we transform,\u201d the representative added.\n\nGuzzi did note, however, that the increased partner funding will help distributors cover gaps with some partners who lost direct coverage by Intel. For the past several years, Intel has funded programs for distributors to provide Intel-related resources to channel partners who do not have Intel salespeople calling on them.\n\n\u201cThey cover all our customers, but what we ask of them for some accounts will increase because those accounts may have lost their Intel salesperson, so there's some additional incentives in place for distributors,\u201d he said.\n\nOne partner impacted by Intel\u2019s coverage change is Houston, Texas-based systems integrator Mark III Systems, according to its vice president of sales, Chris Bogan. However, the executive told CRN that the company hasn\u2019t seen any negative impact on its business with Intel after getting moved to a salesperson at distribution giant TD Synnex.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to get competitive investment funds where we need to. It\u2019s always nice to have an Intel person, but I don't know that we've seen anything that's been concerning or like, \u2018Hey, we've lost support that we used to have and it's costing us business with Intel,\u2019\u201d Bogan said.\n\nWhy Intel Cut Authorized Distributors Abroad\n\nWhen it came to reducing the number of authorized distributors in the EMEA, APJ and China regions, Guzzi said two of the main reasons were complexity and overrepresentation.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about APJ and the number of countries and how disparate they are, some of the countries have multiple islands as their area of operation. It\u2019s very difficult for distributors to cover a number of different countries,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for EMEA, Guzzi said, \u201cthere\u2019s all kinds of challenges with tax laws, languages [\u2026] and some of the non-industry challenges that they've had to deal with.\u201d\n\nHowever, he added, Guzzi\u2019s team also determined using analytics tools that Intel had \u201ctoo many\u201d distributors in EMEA for the size of the region\u2019s total addressable market.\n\n\u201cSome of that is just a little bit of the way EMEA has shifted to become more of a consumption market than a billings market. There are fewer companies that manufacture, so they probably needed fewer distributors to serve them,\u201d Guzzi said.\n\nGuzzi said it took roughly nine to 10 months for his team to determine where to make cuts in Intel\u2019s distribution network and called the process \u201cvery difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn some cases, we had to end long-time relationships with really good distributors [because they] just didn\u2019t fit the model going forward,\u201d he said.",

Financial details of the investment have not been disclosed.\n\nFractile was founded in 2022 by Dr. Walter Goodwin, a then PhD student at the University of Oxford\u2019s Robotics Institute. Speaking to DCD late last year, Goodwin said that towards the end of his studies, he\u2019d started to see the shift away from the training of AI models towards inference, but didn\u2019t believe that existing hardware would be able to support inference at scale.\n\nIn order to combat this problem, Fractile has been developing chips that use in-memory compute, an approach that allows processors to run calculations directly in computer memory. Goodwin told DCD that by taking this approach, the company hopes to create hardware that reduces power consumption and improves performance, all while allowing for faster and less expensive inference at scale.\n\nFractile emerged from stealth in July 2024, having raised $15 million in seed funding from a round co-led by Kindred Capital, Nato Innovation Fund, Oxford Science Enterprises, and a number of angel investors. Entrepreneur Stan Boland, a former Arm and Acorn Computers executive, is also an investor and listed as a director on Companies House \u2013 a UK government register of businesses.\n\nIn his post, Gelsinger said that the approach adopted by Fractile resembled the ideas he was exploring in his graduate work at Stanford University.\n\nThe post continued: \u201cInference of frontier AI models is bottlenecked by hardware. Even before test-time compute scaling, cost and latency were huge challenges for large scale LLM deployments\u2026 To achieve our aspirations for AI, we will need radically faster, cheaper, and much lower power inference.\u201d\n\nIn addition to investing in the company, Gelsinger said he was also looking forward to \u201cadvising the Fractile team as they tackle this vital challenge.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to DCD, Goodwin said: \"I am absolutely thrilled that Pat Gelsinger is joining Fractile as an investor. Few people have had more impact on the world of semiconductors and compute than Pat. All of us at Fractile are looking forward to continuing our work on building towards a generational leap in AI compute capability, with Pat in our corner.\"\n\nYou can read the full DCD interview with Dr. Walter Goodwin here or in issue 55 of the magazine.",

According to the company\u2019s Community post, it is proposing to separate the all-in-one motherboard designs used in laptops into three pieces. It\u2019s also suggesting that mini-PCs, which are traditionally highly integrated and often difficult or impossible to repair or upgrade, be separated into different modules. This move will make these systems far easier to service and would also hopefully reduce the massive amount of e-waste generated each year.\n\nAside from reparability and upgradability, Intel also claims that its scalable designs for laptops will help reduce the engineering efforts made by their partners.\n\nEssentially, the three modules are the motherboard, and two IO modules. The two IO modules, which are connected to the main motherboard via a flexible printed circuit, and can be reused across various laptop sizes (from 14-inch to 16-inch), models, and designs\u2014from fanless 10W thin-and-light systems to mainstream 20W laptops with a single-fan design and 30W premium laptops that feature dual-fan cooling.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Intel) (Image credit: Intel)\n\nThese IO modules can be used across generations, meaning OEMs do not have to completely redesign laptops whenever a new processor or GPU is released. It also leaves the potential for manufacturers to be able to upgrade laptops, including their processor, memory, storage, and wireless modules. Intel also claims that they can be applied to both commercial and consumer designs.\n\nDesktop PCs are already inherently modular, with users able to upgrade their CPU, GPU, memory, storage, and nearly every other module on their computer at home. However, that is not the case for mini-PCs, and Intel wants to change that. The company is proposing breaking down mini-PC modules into three: a CPU module, a GPU module, and a Platform Controller Hub (PCH) module.\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\nThe PCH module would connect the CPU, GPU, and other PCIe add-in cards, allowing for usability just like a typical tower CPU. Intel\u2019s example also showed a 600-watt FlexATX PSU and two hot-swappable NVMe SSDs. Users could then replace these modules at will, making it easier to repair and upgrade them, instead of just replacing the entire system whenever one wants to make a change.\n\nIf the majority of PC and laptop manufacturers adopt this technology, this would make repairing and upgrading these devices much easier. This could reduce the amount of e-waste generated each year.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The EU has relied in large part on the PCLOB to ensure that the U.S. adequately protects personal data, and to address complaints from Europeans about any misuse of their data.\n\nThe agreement, known as the Transatlantic Data Privacy Framework (TDPF), relies on the PCLOB as a \u201ckey oversight mechanism introduced by the U.S. to align its surveillance oversight and accountability standards with EU law,\u201d according to Silvia Lorenzo Perez, the EU program director for security, surveillance and human rights at the Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\nThe PCLOB\u2019s role in ensuring limited bulk data collection by U.S. intelligence agencies is vital for Europe, Perez said.\n\nThe credibility of the safeguards Europe has come to rely on as a prerequisite for allowing cross-border data flows \u201chinges on the PCLOB\u2019s independence and operational capacity,\u201d Perez said. \u201cIf the PCLOB is weakened or rendered non-functional, it undermines trust in the TDPF and the adequacy of protections for EU citizens\u2019 data transferred to the U.S.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s unclear if Trump intends to kneecap PCLOB \u2014 it would not be able to operate with fewer than three members, and only one would be left if its Democratic members resigned or are fired \u2014 or appoint loyalists, having TDPF fall apart could dramatically change the way U.S. companies do business in Europe.\n\nU.S. cloud services would be forced to rely on other mechanisms under Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation in order to continue data transfers. Those alternatives might not always be feasible and \u201ccome with big challenges,\u201d Perez said.\n\nEven the Trump administration\u2019s threat to fire PCLOB members raises significant questions about the agency\u2019s independence moving forward and therefore could imperil Europe\u2019s faith in its oversight, Perez said.\n\nThe PCLOB is highly regarded in Europe and has been seen as a vital check on U.S. surveillance activities and as a necessary bulwark protecting against the violation of Europeans\u2019 privacy, said Joe Jones, director of research at the International Association of Privacy Professionals.\n\nIf losing an operative and independent PCLOB leads to the collapse of TDPA then there would be a \u201clegitimate and real question as to whether you could ever send European data to the United States,\u201d Jones said.\n\nProminent companies have previously said that without the TDPA they might have to pull out of Europe, Jones said.\n\n\u201cThat's the high point of the consequences,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThat's how bad it could get.\u201d",

Laptop designs from companies like Dell and Asus are showing clear inspiration by being much easier to upgrade than they used to be. Intel seems to be paying attention, too, going by some new modular guidelines for both laptops and PCs.\n\nOkay, \u201cguidelines\u201d might be a strong term for these concepts, which Intel laid out in its latest community blog post. But these ideas for modular designs are undeniably appealing.\n\nIntel proposes a setup that breaks a laptop motherboard into three pieces (instead of the usual all-in-one approach), with sub-boards on the left and right (where your USB and HDMI ports go) that can be customized by the manufacturer to support their particular I/O needs. That means that the central motherboard (including the processor and cooling setup) could be upgraded separately from the left and right components.\n\nIntel\n\nIntel\u2019s proposed design integrates separate components for the new LPCAMM memory standard, plus the more common Wi-Fi and SSD upgrades that can be handled with M.2 cards. Intel says that these designs offer \u201cseamless scaling\u201d for laptops with screen sizes from 14 to 16 inches, with options for fanless, single-fan, and dual-fan cooling.\n\nWhat about desktop PCs? They\u2019re already mostly modular, with exceptions for smaller form factors and exotic cases. You know, like mini PCs. These little machines are growing in popularity thanks to low costs and (usually) easy upgrades for RAM and storage. But reliance on laptop parts to fit in those tiny cases means other upgrades are tricky at best.\n\nIntel is also addressing this, with a modular mini PC design that separates the CPU/motherboard module from the GPU (and any other PCIe components) with a platform controller hub, all of which fits into a five-liter chassis. Additional designs could use M.2 boards for I/O replacements and upgrades. It\u2019s not exactly a return to the NUC standard\u2026 but it\u2019s not not that, either.\n\nIntel\n\nIntel\u2019s blog post positions these modular guidelines as a win for environmentalists (by way of reducing e-waste) and right-to-repair proponents. And those are certainly valid points. But I can\u2019t help but notice that the tri-board setup offers advantages over Arm-based laptops (Qualcomm Snapdragon and others), which are typically reliant upon a single integrated board, including memory. To be fair, Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake laptops also have integrated, non-upgradeable memory.\n\nThat being said, more widespread adoption of upgradeable laptop designs is a win-win for everyone. I hope plenty of Intel\u2019s hardware partners take note.",

            "content": "Fractile is focused on AI hardware that runs LLM inference in memory to reduce compute overhead and drive scale\n\nIn December last year, then-CEO of Intel Pat Gelsinger abruptly retired as the company\u2019s turnaround strategy, largely marked by a separation of the semiconductor design and fabrication businesses, didn\u2019t convince investors. And while Intel apparently failed to sell its AI story to Wall Street, Gelsinger has continued his focus on scaling AI with an investment in a U.K. startup.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post published this week, Gelsinger announced his investment in a company called Fractile which specializes in AI hardware that processes large language model (LLM) inferencing in memory rather than moving model weights from memory to a processor, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cInference of frontier AI models is bottlenecked by hardware,\u201d Gelsinger wrote. \u201cEven before test-time compute scaling, cost and latency were huge challenges for large-scale LLM deployments. With the advent of reasoning models, which require memory-bound generation of thousands of output tokens, the limitations of existing hardware roadmaps [have] compounded. To achieve our aspirations for AI, we need radically faster, cheaper and much lower power inference.\u201d\n\nA few things to unpack there. The core AI scaling laws essentially prove out that model size, dataset size and underlying compute power need to concurrently scale to increase the performance of an AI system. Test-time scaling is an emerging AI scaling law that refers to techniques applied during inference that enhance performance and drive efficiency without any retraining of the underlying LLM\u2014things like dynamic model adjustment, input-specific scaling, quantization at inference, efficient batch processing and so forth. Read more on AI scaling laws here.\n\nThis also touches on edge AI which, generally speaking, is all about moving inferencing onto personal devices like handsets or PCs, or the infrastructure that\u2019s one hop away from personal devices, on-premise enterprise datacenters, mobile network operator base stations, and otherwise distributed compute infrastructure that isn\u2019t a hyperscaler or other centralized cloud. The idea is multi-faceted; in a nutshell, edge AI would improve latency, reduce compute costs, enhance personalization through contextual awareness, and improve data privacy and potentially better adhere to data sovereignty rules and regulations.\n\nGelsinger\u2019s interest in edge AI isn\u2019t new. It\u2019s something he studied at Stanford University, and it\u2019s something he pushed in his stint as CEO of Intel. In fact, during CES in 2024, Gelsinger examined the benefits of edge AI in a keynote interview. The lead was the company\u2019s then-latest CPUs for AI PCs but the more important subtext was in his description of the three laws of edge computing.\n\n\u201cFirst is the laws of economics,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper to do it on your device\u2026I\u2019m not renting cloud servers\u2026Second is the laws of physics. If I have to round-trip the data to the cloud and back, it\u2019s not going to be as responsive as I can do locally\u2026And third is the laws of the land. Am I going to take my data to the cloud or am I going to keep it on my local device?\u201d\n\nLooking at Fractile\u2019s approach, Gelsinger called out how the company\u2019s \u201cin-memory compute approach to inference acceleration jointly tackles two bottlenecks to scaling inference, overcoming both the memory bottleneck that holds back today\u2019s GPUs, while decimating power consumption, the single biggest physical constraint we face over the next decade in scaling up data center capacity.\u201d\n\nGelsinger continued in his recent post: \u201cIn the global race to build leading AI models, the role of inference performance is still under-appreciated. Being able to run any given model orders of magnitude faster, at a fraction of the cost and maybe most importantly at [a] dramatically lower power envelop[e] provides a performance leap equivalent to years of lead on model development. I look forward to advising the Fractile team as they tackle this vital challenge.\u201d",

            "content": "E-waste is a major stumbling block to sustainability. Three Intel executives want to address this in the form of modular, upgradeable computers. What does that entail?\n\nIt is anything but a new idea: Framework derives its raison d\u2019\u00eatre from the fact that every component of its own laptops is replaceable. This prevents a broken port or faulty display from sending the entire device to an early retirement. A trio at Intel wants to go along with this in the form of a modular design.\n\nThree forms\n\nThis modularity comes in three forms. First, factory modularity, referring to a modular nature only accessible to the PC manufacturer, which can replace a component when required. Intel compares this level to that of an engine change for a car, which only specific mechanics may be able to work on and not the end user. Second is field modularity, or being able to replace components through consulting a technician but not requiring factory facilities. Third, there is user modularity, or the ability to replace a component by the user himself.\n\nWe\u2019re actually already quite familiar with that third form: Intel cites Wi-Fi dongles and user-upgradable storage as examples which are on-the-fly changes users can make with ease. But the company is advocating a more radical shift in PC architecture. A new-style PC should have a minimal carbon footprint, be scalable, repairable, support hassle-free updates, be cost-effective and consist of fewer SKUs. Quite the change-up, then.\n\nFeasible\n\nFramework laptops have already shown that PCs can be modular and marketed as such. Again, sustainability is the primary rationale for this setup. However, Framework is a boutique option with limited reach, something that would not apply to Intel. \u2018Chipzilla\u2019 has caused the PC industry to move forward on several occasions, such as with the ultrabook a decade ago. This made laptops significantly thinner than before through Intel pushing for new requirements to become standardized. A similar phenomenon is taking place with the AI PC, something that Intel, AMD as well as Qualcomm are pursuing along with OEMs.\n\nHowever, this new Intel concept requires some more modifications than just downsizing or an onboard NPU, as was required for ultrabooks and AI PCs, respectively. This pushes PCs into a more strictly regulated format, beyond the familiar standards that were already allowing for customizability and standardization. That, too, is a form of sustainability, even thoguh the bulk of PCs worldwide come ready-made and are never upgraded.\n\nConsider the size of motherboards (ATX and derivatives), PCIe slots (for SSDs, GPUs and other peripherals) and native power supply sizes as examples of in-built sustainable, reusable components. Some of these concepts can be transferred to Intel\u2019s idea, but not without curtailing some freedom of movement for users already familiar with the old platform. After all, PC owners can already reuse or replace certain components, but this is often made impossible in a business context by artificial means.\n\nEnd to containment?\n\nCompanies such as Dell, HP and Lenovo have been building PCs that only allow limited customizability or sometimes none whatsoever for decades. Herein lies already a substantial problem when it comes to sustainability. Examples include locked BIOSes, unique motherboard sizes and proprietary cabling. These actively counteract the standardized format PCs can be made in.\n\nA truly modular standard actually requires building on standards that are already known. In the enterprise market, this modular concept can be combined with fixed upgrade cycles, such as new GPUs for graphic designers or AI developers every 24 months to keep up-to-date. Intel is advocating for familiar components and interfaces such as M.2 and USB-C so that compatibility is maximized. Still, everything depends on the exact format in which the modular PCs are built. And there are no guarantees that all this will be more sustainable: perhaps upgrading becomes so attractive and straightforward that it actually creates more e-waste due to heavier demand. The current valley in PC demand post-Covid is actually doing sustainability efforts a great favour, if you will.\n\nFor laptops, the new Intel architecture would be a big step forward in terms of longevity. Today, it is common that even system memory is not upgradeable because the modules are soldered to the motherboard. I/O is also rarely replaceable, and certainly not by an ordinary user. Intel\u2019s proposal would save laptops from an early demise through replaceable I/O, easy upgrades and scalable components. On desktops, though, the concept is a bit less revolutionary, and the small, standardized size suggests we are not talking about the most powerful workstations here. Those typically require more space than what is shown by Intel in its mock-ups (see here), unless Intel is pushing the same concept as Nvidia\u2019s Project Digits with a heavy bias towards a big GPU and a tiny motherboard in the final go-to market SKU. Project Digits involves an \u201cAI supercomputer for your desk,\u201d although its scope and circulation is still limited.\n\nThe new PC\n\nIntel\u2019s proposal seems to strike a middle ground between some of the unadaptable PCs of OEMs and the do-it-yourself computers of enthusiasts, mostly gamers. By setting a new standard, it may be possible for PC builders to introduce cost-effective upgrades. Since margins are minimal for hardware vendors, a change like this may also be inevitable in the long run. Consumers do not want to upgrade every year, something the ailing PC market has shown signs of for years. Something\u2019s got to give, it appears.\n\nOn top of that comes the fact that Nvidia may pose a threat with eventual successors to Project Digits. For now, this is \u201conly\u201d a devkit PC, but we already see in it the outlines of a future AI PC with enough computing power to provide an entire office with local AI inferencing capabilities. For a few thousand euros in terms of the initial cost and just the energy costs after that, an organization will save a lot of cash when it\u2019s not having to use an API to fulfill its AI needs.\n\nThis is a concept that has yet to reach reality, much like Intel\u2019s proposal. Still, it is a telling sign that both Nvidia and Intel are coming up with an entirely new form of PC almost simultaneously. Margins are drying up, customers are staying away for an unsustainably long time, and raw materials are only getting more expensive. This requires an innovative look at what the PC means in the year 2025. For the first time in decades, an alternative to the three- to five-year upgrade cycle has been proposed.\n\nAlso read: Nvidia announces an AI supercomputer for your desk",

Fouquet said this was \"mainly related to the delayed timing of EUV [extreme ultraviolet lithography] demand\".\n\nChristophe Fouquet, CEO of ASML, said that the company expected total net sales of between \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn) and \u20ac35bn for 2025, \"which is the lower half of the range that we provided at our 2022 Investor Day\".\n\nIn addition, ASML cut its net sales forecast for 2025, which saw shares tumble.\n\nInvestors were rattled in October when the company released its results a day early , which was attributed to a \"technical error\".\n\nDutch company ASML is considered a bellweather for the global chip industry, so it's full-year results is likely to draw much market focus.\n\nHere's more on what to look for:\n\nMerger rumours have been swirling around miner Glencore ( GLEN.L ), which is due to release its year-end production report in the coming week.\n\nShell ( SHEL )'s latest quarterly results come as oil prices come under renewed pressure from comments by Trump on lowering prices.\n\nFollowing some positive news in the luxury sector, investors will be hoping LVMH ( LVMUY )'s results can add to optimism.\n\nChipmaker Intel ( INTC ) is due to report, as the company continues its search for a new CEO.\n\nIn terms of other earnings due out in the coming week, investors will be looking closely at the full-year results from ASML ( ASML ), as it manufactures lithography machines that are key to making chips and so is used to help gauge semiconductor demand.\n\nMarkets will also be watching what US president Donald Trump has on the policy agenda for his second week back in office.\n\nTesla ( TSLA ), Meta ( META ), Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Apple ( AAPL ) will be releasing results this week, attracting plenty of investor attention.\n\nThe \"Magnificent 7\" are set to dominate earnings focus in the coming week, as four of these tech giants are due to report, though there are still a number of other big names releasing results.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrump's approach to chip export policies is likely to be a key consideration for the company and the industry more broadly, given the Biden administration's efforts already to limit China's access to the technology.\n\nDutch prime minister Dick Schoof said in an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos that he expected Trump to keep pushing to restrict ASML's exports of machines to China.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration pushed very hard and I expect the Trump administration pushing the same way,\u201d he said.\n\nIntel (INTC) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter on Thursday 30 January\n\nChipmaker Intel (INTC) has suffered a series of struggles, which saw its shares sink last year and has left them down 55% on a one-year basis.\n\nBack in August, Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted from his role as Intel CEO last month, announced \"significant actions\" to reduce costs. He said the firm planned to deliver $10bn (\u00a38bn) in cost savings in 2025, which included reducing the company's head count by around 15,000 roles.\n\nIn the third quarter, Intel (INTC) beat expectations on revenue, which came in at $13.28bn, versus estimates of $13bn. However, the company posted a loss per share of $0.46, which was much worse than analyst expectations of $0.03.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nAt the same time, positive fourth quarter guidance and a beat on data center revenue, lifted Intel's shares.\n\nIntel (INTC) said it expects revenue to come in at between $13.3bn and $14.3bn for the fourth quarter, versus Wall Street estimates of $13.6bn.\n\nGelsinger then announced his exit in December and the company's board appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe company's board has also brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip (MCHP) chairman Steve Sanghi.\n\nYahoo Finance reported that there were a number of candidates at the centre of conversations to take on the role, though insiders said there were no clear frontrunners yet.\n\nMeanwhile, SemiAccurate recently reported that a mystery company is trying to acquire the company as a whole. A spokesperson for Intel declined to comment on the report.\n\nLVMH (MC.PA) \u2014 Releases full-year results on Tuesday 28 January\n\nLuxury stocks rallied on the back of Cartier-owner Richemont's (CFR.SW) latest trading update, which reported a surge in sales in the third quarter.\n\nThis sparked hopes of a turnaround for the luxury sector, which has been out of fashion with investor for some time. Companies have struggled as rising cost pressures on consumers forced them to rein in spending and brands have been particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\n\nHowever, Richemont's trading update lifted investor spirits and the share prices of Paris listed companies LVMH, Kering (KER.PA) and Herm\u00e8s (RMS.PA), as well as iconic British brand Burberry (BRBY.L) and Hong Kong-listed Italian company Prada (1913.HK).\n\nBurberry's third quarter update, released on Friday, added to optimism, after it reported better-than-expected festive sales.\n\nThis drove Burberry shares to surge nearly 13% on Friday morning, while Kering gained nearly 9% and LVMH was up 3%.\n\nRead more: 6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally\n\nAttention will now turn to LVMH's full-year results on Tuesday 28 January, with hopes that it will have seen some improvement since its third quarter results.\n\nLVMH reported a 3% drop in revenue in the third quarter to \u20ac19.08bn, dragging shares lower.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a tough period for luxury powerhouse, LVMH, with sales coming under pressure and missing market forecasts by a wide margin last quarter,\" said Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L).\n\n\"Price hikes in the Fashion and Leather goods division weren\u2019t enough to offset falling volumes, and Wines & Spirits continued to struggle against a backdrop of weak Chinese demand.\"\n\nHowever, Chiekrie said that the recent excitement around Richemonth had buoyed stocks in the stock, \"helping LVMH regain its spot as Europe\u2019s most valuable company.\"\n\n\"But whether LVMH can retain this crown will depend somewhat on its ability to meet market expectations, which are looking for full-year revenue to fall by no more than 2.2% to \u20ac84.3bn from next week\u2019s results, before returning to growth the following year.\"\n\nShell (SHEL.L) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter results on Thursday 30 January\n\nOil prices remain under pressure, with existing concerns about reduced demand, while comments from newly reinstated US president Trump have dragged on the commodity.\n\nIn a speech made remotely to the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump said that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, to bring down the price of oil.\n\n\"I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down,\" he said.\n\nThis prompted oil prices to slide, with brent crude (BZ=F) dipping back below $78 a barrel.\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said brent crude \"obediently followed president Trump\u2019s calls for lower oil prices\".\n\n\"However, there are signs of industry resistance building to his mandate to 'drill baby drill',\" he said.\n\nRead more: FTSE housing stocks set to benefit from property market rebound\n\n\"Such a move could undermine profitability for the industry and Rystad Energy and Wood Mackenzie are now forecasting that total US oil output in Trump\u2019s second term will rise by less than 1.3 million barrels a day. For now, a ninth consecutive fall in US inventories suggests that supply remains tight meaning that further dips in the price can\u2019t be assured.\"\n\nOil major Shell attributed its dip in earnings in the third quarter to lower refining margins, lower realised oil prices and higher operating expenses.\n\nShell reported that adjusted earnings fell by 4% on the second quarter from nearly $6.3bn, though this was strongly ahead of expectations.\n\nCommenting separately, Nathan said that Shell's recent trading statement \"revealed that while most business units have been trading broadly in line with previous guidance, the production and liquification ranges for integrated gas has been lowered.\n\n\"These are set to come in below third quarter levels, reflecting planned maintenance at its processing facility in Qatar, as well as the timing of shipments from offshore gas fields,\" he said. \"The weakness should be partially offset by an improved outlook for corporate costs.\"\n\nNathan added that investors will also be looking out for any comments on shareholder distributions, given Shell has announced buybacks of at least $3bn in each of the last 12 quarters.\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L) \u2014 Releases year-end production report on Thursday 30 January\n\nShares in miner Glencore recently ticked higher on reports that it had held early-stage talks with Rio Tinto (RIO.L) over a potential merger.\n\nReuters reported that that Glencore approached Rio Tinto late last year with a merger proposition but that discussions did not progress.\n\nIn addition, the report said that a Glencore spokesperson said the company was open to merger and acquisition transactions that create value for shareholders.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nSpokespeople for Glencore and Rio Tinto had not responded to Yahoo Finance UK's request for comment at the time of writing.\n\nGlencore reported lower production for copper, cobalt, zinc, nickel and thermal coal in the first nine months of the year.\n\nHowever, the miner said its outlook remained unchanged for 2024 overall for copper production, expecting between 950,000 and 1.01 million tonnes.\n\nGlencore also said it continued to expect marketing adjusted earnings before interest and tax for the full-year to be in the range of $3bn to $3.5bn. Glencore CEO Gary Nagle highlighted that this was around the top end of its long-term guidance range of $2.2bn to $3.2bn per annum.\n\nFollowing the release of Glencore's year-end production report next week, the company's preliminary annual results for 2024 are then due out on 19 February.\n\nOther companies reporting this week include:\n\nMonday 27 January\n\nDr Martens (DOCS.L)\n\nFanuc (6954.T)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nNucor (NUE)\n\nSofi Technologies (SOFI)\n\nSanmina (SANM)\n\nTuesday 28 January\n\nIdox (IDOX.L)\n\nAG Barr (BAG.L)\n\nHarworth Group (HWG.L)\n\nPets at Home (PETS.L)\n\nSSP Group (SSPG.L)\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nAtlas Copco (ATLPF)\n\nLogitech (LOGI)\n\nRTX (RTX)\n\nStryker (SYK)\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nChubb (CB)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruise (RCL)\n\nGeneral Motors Co (GM)\n\nKimberly Clark (KMB)\n\nArcher Daniels Midland adm (ADM)\n\nPackaging Corporation of America (PKG)\n\nF5 Networks (FFIV)\n\nQorvo (QRVO)\n\nWednesday 29 January\n\nAJ Bell (AJB.L)\n\nHardide (HDD.L)\n\nHargreaves Services (HSP.L)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nMeta (META)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nAdvantest (6857.T)\n\nTata Motors (TATAMOTORS.NS)\n\nVolvo AB (VOLV-B.ST)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nT-Mobile USA (TMUS)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD)\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nHess (HESM)\n\nCorning (OC)\n\nOtis Worldwide (OTIS)\n\nRockwell (ROK)\n\nTeradyne (TER)\n\nWestern Digital (WDC)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nThursday 30 January\n\n3i Group (III.L)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nBT Group (BT-A.L)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nSage Group (SGE.L)\n\nSt James's Place (STJ.L)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nWizz Air Holdings (WIZZ.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nRank (RNK.L)\n\nTakeda Pharmaceuticals (4502.T)\n\nAdani Ports (ADANIPORTS.NS)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nABB (ABBNY)\n\nBBVA (BBVA)\n\nCaixa Bank (CABK.MC)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nAltria (MO)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nCigna (CI)\n\nFerrari (RACE)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC)\n\nMicrochip (MCHP)\n\nL3 Harris (LHX.MX)\n\nDow (DOW)\n\nFriday 31 January\n\nChevron Corp (CVX)\n\nFujitsu 6702 (6702.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nTDK (6762.T)\n\nMitsui OSK (5273.T)\n\nSamsung Electronics (005930.KS)\n\nNovartis (NOVN.SW)\n\nExxonMobil xom (XOM)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nPhillips 66 (PSX)\n\nLyondellBasell (LYB)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nRead more:\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

            "content": "HILLSBORO Ore. (KPTV) - The Oregon City veterinarian accused of murdering a man at an Intel parking garage in Hillsboro was found guilty on Wednesday, according to the Washington Co. District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nA Washington County jury found Steven Neil Milner guilty of choking Kenneth Fandrich to death on Jan. 27, 2023 at the Intel facility where Fandrich worked as a contractor, after Milner had stalked and harassed Fandrich for several years.\n\nAccording to court documents, Milner had an affair with a longtime employee, who was married to Fandrich. After Fandrich learned of her affair with Milner, Fandrich\u2019s wife broke it off.\n\nMilner responded by stalking Fandrich and his wife.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nThree teenagers were arrested following an armed carjacking in the West Minnehaha area last week.\n\nIn March 2022, Fandrich was granted a stalking protective order. According to court documents, this order followed years of harassment which included finding numerous GPS tracking devices that Milner had attached to Fandrich and his wife\u2019s cars, and collecting home surveillance video showing Milner sneaking onto their property.\n\nDespite the order, Milner installed another GPS tracking device on Fandrich\u2019s car and followed him to his Oregon City home and, \u201cmore than a dozen times,\u201d to his workplace at Intel Ronler Acres in Hillsboro, according to the DA\u2019s office.\n\nMilner was criminally charged in Clackamas County for breaking the court order, but continued to do so while on conditional release, the DA said.\n\nOctober 2022, Milner bought a different car through Craigslist to more covertly follow Fandrich to his Hillsboro workplace.\n\nOn Dec. 13, 2022, Intel surveillance cameras showed Milner at the parking structure in disguise. While there, he used spray paint to cover several security cameras, including those watching where Fandrich usually parked, to test Intel\u2019s security.\n\nOver the next several weeks, Milner repeatedly showed up in the Intel parking structure to watch Fandrich\u2019s patterns as he came and went from work.\n\nIn early January 2023, Milner purchased a second car under a false identity - a minivan, which he used to continue watching Fandrich in the Intel parking structure.\n\nOn Jan. 27, 2023, Milner used both cars for his murder plan, the DA said.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nTwo men stole from the nonprofit St. Johns Food Share early Saturday morning.\n\nFirst, Milner entered the parking structure in disguise and waited for Fandrich to park his car and walk inside. Then, Milner again spray-painted the security cameras around Fandrich\u2019s car.\n\nMilner left the scene and returned in the recently purchased minivan, which he parked next to Fandrich\u2019s car. He waited in the van until Fandrich got off work.\n\nWhen Fandrich reached his car, Milner ambushed him from behind and grabbed him in a chokehold. After killing Fandrich, Milner staged his body and belongings back in his car, trying to make it look like he died of natural causes.\n\nFandrich was later found dead in his car, but an autopsy revealed injury to his neck and spine.\n\nPolice arrested Milner for the murder on Jan. 31, 2023.\n\nAt trial, Milner testified in his own defense, claiming he acted in self-defense after Fandrich attacked him. The jury rejected this claim and found him guilty of second-degree murder, stalking, and seven counts of violating a protective order.\n\nA sentencing hearing is scheduled for Feb. 18, 2025.\n\nCopyright 2025 KPTV-KPDX.

            "content": "Intel claims a more modular approach to PC design could make systems easier to repair and reduce electronic waste \u2013 and it has some proposals for you.\n\nIn a blog posting authored by a trio of Intel execs, the x86 behemoth makes the case that the current monolithic approach to building devices leads to premature disposal, typically because a component becomes obsolete or fails. It suggests that a modular PC architecture could address this issue by making it easier to replace parts, rather than discarding entire systems.\n\nThis idea aligns with the goals of the growing right-to-repair movement, which advocates for designs that prioritize repairability and upgradeability. By enabling users to swap out components with ease, modular architectures are seen as a way to reduce e-waste and extend the usable life of devices, Intel says.\n\nThe chipmaker has called the modular PC architecture \"an innovative approach.\" But hold on a moment \u2013 this writer (along with plenty of Reg readers, no doubt) recalls putting together their first ever PC from components sourced from numerous places in the days when disk controllers, I/O, and even the display circuitry all came on separate plug-in cards.\n\nWhy is this relevant today? Well, the authors point to figures indicating that over 60 million tons of e-waste is generated each year, with less than 25 percent of it collected and less than 12 percent recycled, with computers claimed to make up almost 70 percent of said e-waste.\n\nThis has been covered before by The Register. A United Nations report last year found that the world is creating e-waste almost five times faster than it is being recycled using documented methods, with the estimated annual economic monetary cost of e-waste reaching $37 billion.\n\nAlso last year, a group of electronics companies was advocating for the UK to remove VAT on electronic spare parts, repairs, and labor, in the hope this would encourage users to get hardware repaired instead of replacing it.\n\nIt should also be noted that at least one company, Framework Computer, already offers modular laptop models that allow users to customize and replace parts.\n\nIntel's approach to the problem is to draft three proposals targeting different market segments, saying that a one-size-fits-all approach would not be able to address the nuanced demands of these varied segments.\n\nThose three segments comprise \"Premium Modular PC\" (actually a laptop design); \"Entry/Mainstream Modular PC\" (another laptop); and \"Desktop Modular PC.\"\n\nThe first envisages a three-board system, comprising a core motherboard plus universal left and right I/O boards, the latter engineered to be common across fan-less Thin & Light designs with a 10W power envelope, and premium fanned designs for up to 20W or 30W.\n\nThe Entry/Mainstream Modular PC is similar, with a core motherboard and left and right I/O boards, although in this segment, Intel says these can be redesigned to allow multiple SKUs of the design. The circuit boards are also cost-optimized here to cater to the mainstream segment, it says.\n\nThe Desktop Modular PC design appears from Intel's diagram to use a midplane that has the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) silicon, with other modules connecting to this. These include CPU, memory, and GPU modules, removable using slide rails, along with hot-swappable storage, all designed to fit inside a 5 liter desktop chassis.\n\nIntel also said it is introducing subsystem-level replaceable modules. In practice, this means something like a Type-C connector on a flexible printed circuit (FPC) or an M.2 circuit board. The idea is that the module can easily be swapped out if the port or connector is damaged.\n\nThe blog authors argue these designs, which enable easy upgrades and component replacements, could extend device lifespans and reduce e-waste.\n\nAccording to Intel, it is working closely with customers and partners on this - though there is no certainty anything like these designs will ever be adopted by vendors, especially if it turns out they add to the system cost. \u00ae",

            "content": "In 2022, Fractile CEO Dr. Walter Goodwin was trying to build \u201cgeneral purpose robot brains.\u201d While making robots that are good at many things - most are currently good at just doing one specific thing over and over again - was the focus of Goodwin\u2019s efforts, he says at that point in his studies at the UK\u2019s Oxford Robotics Institute, his interests became less about how well a robot could pick up a mug, and more about scaling laws. Having spent four years working on big vision and language AI models that had been trained on images and texts scraped from the Internet, Goodwin says he saw how scaling laws had been \u201crocking that AI world,\u201d particularly when it comes to model training and the idea that increasing the training flops for a foundation model\u2019s training run would bring a deterministic improvement in how that model works.\n\nDr. Walter Goodwin, founder and CEO of Fractile \u2013 Fractile\n\nAt the time, Goodwin says he was part of a group that started pushing the idea that, as foundation models continue to permeate our lives, this would be accompanied by an inevitable shift in how we think more broadly about AI. He explains that, from 2011 to \u201cmaybe 2020,\u201d every problem had its own specific neural network, meaning companies would collect a data set, find the right neural network architecture, and then train it for a specific application until it became good enough. \u201cTowards the end of my PhD, what I was increasingly convinced by was that [the application-specific neural networks] were going to be eclipsed by this idea of the \u2018do it all\u2019 AI model that is trained on just huge swathes of data and would generalize very well,\u201d Goodwin says. \u201cI was seeing that in robotics, and I could see that the same would start to happen with language and vision. \u201cAnd what happens is, when you get that shift, the big story in AI stops being: \u2018How do we train a slightly better model;\u2019 it actually stops being so much about that training at all, and it shifts much more to: \u2018If we\u2019re going to be running this small set of models at this vast scale, how are we actually going to do that in a sustainable way?\u2019\u201d With that in mind, Goodwin returned to his electrical engineering background, forming Fractile to answer the question: \u201cIf we\u2019re heading towards a world where most compute power is focused on inference, is our current hardware fit for purpose?\u201d For Fractile, the chip company he founded, the answer was a resounding no.\n\nAI inference is your new best friend While training has dominated AI conversations in the last few years, recently companies of all sizes have publicly announced a move away from training AI models to focus on the less computationally intensive inference, where, simply put, an AI model uses the patterns it's been trained on to make predictions. On Microsoft\u2019s Q1 2025 earnings call in October, CEO Satya Nadella said the company was on track to generate $10bn in annual revenue from AI inference and, as a result, the company was turning away requests to use its GPUs for training \"because we have so much demand on inference.\" Goodwin says that platforms built based on von Neumann architecture - the basis for most general-purpose computers - are full of memory-bound stages which cause a latency cost tradeoff. This is less of an issue when training models because throughput, not latency, is the focus. However, when it comes to inference, users expect it to be done at speed, what he calls the \u201cinference time concept\u201d \u2013 \u201c[OpenAI\u2019s] o1 is the best model in the world, but you have to wait 15 seconds for an answer.\u201d Goodwin says that, for the best part of the last two years, Fractile has been talking to people about this concept of inference scaling. \u201cWe\u2019ve had scaling laws in training where you increase the training flops, but what inference scaling says is that AI performance is actually about two things,\u201d he explains. \u201cHow good you can make the base model, and how to use more compute to get better AI outcomes.\u201d To achieve these better outcomes, the UK-based company has been developing chips that use in-memory compute, an approach that allows processors to run calculations directly in computer memory. Goodwin says that by taking this approach, the company hopes to create hardware that reduces power consumption and improves performance, all while allowing for faster and less expensive inference at scale.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re heading towards a world where most compute power is focused on inference, is our current hardware fit for purpose?\u201d For Fractile, the answer was a resounding no.\n\nIn July 2024, Fractile emerged from stealth, having raised $15 million in seed funding from a round co-led by Kindred Capital, Nato Innovation Fund, Oxford Science Enterprises, and a number of angel investors, including entrepreneur Stan Boland, a former Arm and Acorn Computers executive who has built and sold a number of chip and AI companies. Since this interview was conducted, it has added former Intel and VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger to its list of backers. Gelsinger, who 'retired' from the chipmaking giant in December, will also advise the company as it grows. In a LinkedIn post announcing his investment he praised Fractile for its \"radical approach\" to tackling the inference question. While Fractile has yet to bring its product to market, the company believes its hardware will ultimately be able to run large language models 100\u00d7 faster and 10\u00d7 cheaper than Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, and have a 20\u00d7 better performance per watt of energy than any other AI hardware currently on the market - although by the time it does launch, competitor hardware will have advanced substantially. Goodwin notes that, while there are a few companies that are also exploring this concept of more on-chip memory, what Fractile is looking to do differently is remove the need for a separate memory bank and processor, allowing the company to better address what Goodwin believes is the most critical limitation in compute scaling right now, power. \u201c[With Fractile\u2019s approach] what you can achieve is far, far, far higher than you would get if you just had that near memory compute piece. While [near memory] is good for driving up the bandwidth, it doesn't drive up your TOPS per watt, so you still have a chip that ultimately is going to be thermally limited. For a long time now, we've been thermally limited in how we scale up these systems. \u201c[For Fractile] it\u2019s about building a system that will allow us to run inference at scale for these very large models, far faster. That means more tokens per second, more words output per second per user, but also doing all this in a much less expensive way as well.\u201d And unlike most companies focusing on in-memory compute that have thus far mostly deployed hardware in low-power Edge devices, Goodwin says what\u2019s exciting for Fractile is that it\u2019s one of the only companies trying to bring this technology to data center scale workloads. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that's more unique about what we're doing,\u201d he says. However, despite the company\u2019s ambition, Goodwin explains that one thing Fractile has been careful not to do is simultaneously reinvent too many things, as it's important that the company can achieve not only a good time to market but also scale up production and play within the rules of existing semiconductor manufacturing. \u201cFractile is doing things that might be kind of radical in terms of the circuits that we're designing for in-memory compute and how we're thinking about architecture and software but at the lowest level, from a silicon design point of view, we're doing our test chips at TSMC process nodes and our production chips will be at cutting-edge FinFET nodes on standard foundry processes. In that sense, we're seeking to be as normal as possible from a manufacturability point of view.\u201c",

            "content": "Almost immediately after the launch of its Arrow Lake desktop CPUs in October 2024, Intel said it would work on producing firmware and software updates to improve its lacklustre performance. The likes of the Core Ultra 9 285K not only ran games slower than Raptor Lake chips, the previous generation of processors, but also worse than Intel's claimed internal results.\n\nNear the end of December, Intel released a report on what it had identified as going wrong with Arrow Lake and what fixes were coming to solve them all. So, as we approach the three-month mark since the Core Ultra 200S series of CPUs first appeared, I wanted to see just how much better things are.\n\nTo that end, I've used an MSI MAG Z890 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard, sporting the latest 1.A70 BIOS and all of Intel's most current drivers. I'm also using Windows 11 24H2, as some of the fixes are embedded within operating system updates.\n\nIn terms of RAM and GPU, it's the exact same setup I used when I first checked out the Core Ultra 9 285K in this MSI motherboard: 32 GB of DDR5-6000 CL32 and a GeForce RTX 4070. Enough jibber-jabber, let's go through all the new results with our CPU gaming benchmark suite.\n\nCyberpunk 2077\n\nSince October of last year, Cyberpunk 2077 has been patched six times, so some of the changes you can see might be down to that. But even if they are, the 285K does run our CP2077 benchmark a little better than before, with an uplift of 15% and 12% to the average and 1% low frame rates respectively.\n\nIt's not a huge increase but it's better than nothing, and free performance is free. And it's also on par with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, though still slower than the Core i9 14900K with the 1% lows. At least we're off to a good start with the updates!\n\nBaldur's Gate 3\n\nWell, this is disappointing. That 2% increase in the average frame rate isn't worth shouting about, especially in the face of the significant 19% decrease in the 1% lows. I've checked those figures multiple times but that performance deficit doesn't change.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nCompared to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the Core Ultra 9 285K looks ridiculously weak in this test, and while it's not much slower than the 14900K, with regards to the average frame rate, the 1% low figures are 32% lower.\n\nWhy this is happening isn't clear and I can't identify anything specific, using my usual performance analysis tools (PIX on Windows, Nsight Systems), that suggests what the problem is. I suspect Windows 11 24H2 might have something to do with it, as I've noticed that minimum frame rates across multiple test PCs have all dropped with the OS update.\n\nHomeworld 3\n\nHomeworld 3 falls the same pattern as seen with Baldur's Gate 3\u2014the average frame rate is a little better but the 1% lows are worse. The Core Ultra 9 285K isn't too far behind its predecessor, but once again, the 9800X3D makes a mockery of them both.\n\nSo far, then, we're 1-2 in terms of gains and losses with the Arrow Lake updates affecting game performance. This isn't looking all that great, yes?\n\nMetro Exodus Enhanced\n\nEnter stage left, Metro Exodus Enhanced to save the day! Admittedly, it's only a 9% improvement to the average frame rate and the 1% lows are just 5% better, but the 285K is now faster than the 14900K!\n\nWell, the 14900K as it was back in August, which was when we last tested that power-monching monster. Meanwhile the 9800X3D is just sitting there, waving its 3D V-Cache at them both and going nyer-nyer.\n\nTotal War: Warhammer 3\n\nOh dear. Oh, this isn't good at all. That's a 20% improvement to the average frame rate but at a cost of an enormous 37% decrease to the 1% lows. And before you ask, I checked those figures time and time again, with system reboots, driver installs, and even a spot of cheating in the form of overclocking to see if there was something I've missed.\n\nThere wasn't\u2014the 285K really is goosed in Total War: Warhammer 3 with all the latest BIOS, driver, and OS updates. The 9800X3D's 1% lows are 97% better. Ninety seven.\n\nFactorio\n\nStrictly speaking, our Factorio test isn't quite a full test of the game itself. Instead, we use a benchmark script on a massive, complex map that just runs the game's engine minus all rendering, over 5,000 cycles. It's a fantastic test for how good a CPU's last-level cache is (L3 in the case of these chips) and it's one that AMD's 3D V-Cache just loves.\n\nWith a 23% decrease in the processing time, you'd think that this is some good news for Arrow Lake but it's not really. That's because the initial time of 33.3 seconds was due to a BIOS issue with the MSI motherboard, that eventually got resolved late last year.\n\nThat time of 25.5 seconds just puts it in line with the Asus ROG Maximus Z890 Hero I used for the initial review of the Core Ultra 9 285K. In other words, the chip performed no better in our Factorio test than it did four months ago.\n\nIntel Application Optimizer\n\nOne thing that Intel noted in its report about Arrow Lake's performance was that a missing power profile meant that its thread scheduling software (Intel Application Optimizer, APO) just didn't work as intended.\n\nIt only works with games that Intel has specifically tested and tweaked the scheduler for, and in this case, it's just Cyberpunk 2077, Metro Exodus Enhanced, and Total War: Warhammer 3. We don't include APO results in our processor reviews to keep things fair but any PC gamer with an Arrow Lake should be using it.\n\nOr maybe not, if my test results are anything to go by. Who wants an 11% drop in the 1% lows in Cyberpunk 2077? And if it's not doing anything to help in Metro Exodus, why bother using it? At least it did help out in Warhammer 3, to the tune of 11% in the 1% lows.\n\nJust as with the other tests, I reran the APO checks multiple times and used different power profiles to see if it would make a difference. Well, it didn't.\n\nArrow Lake in January 2025\n\nI've only tested six games but it's clear that for these specific ones, Intel's fixes and Microsoft's Windows updates have barely made any difference and in some cases, it's made things significantly worse.\n\nThere are probably games out there that are markedly better now but I'm doubtful that Arrow Lake is ever going to be as good as Intel first claimed when it launched the CPU architecture.\n\nBut what really isn't helping matters is the fact that the 'best' Arrow Lake is hugely expensive.\n\nIf you head over to Amazon right now, you'll see that the Core Ultra 9 285K costs $600. With no movement in the price tag since launch, there's no reason for me to change my recommendation about the processor, i.e. it's just not worth buying it.\n\nIf you can find one at a sensible price, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the gaming CPU to buy. (Image credit: Future)\n\nArrow Lake is good for content creation and productivity applications\u2014I've retested the 285K in Cinebench 2024, Blender, 7zip, and Handbrake and while there's no improvement worth noting, it's still just as strong as it was.\n\nBut for gaming? It's not great and the far cheaper Core Ultra 7 265K ($372 at Amazon) would be the sensible choice to pick if one absolutely must have an Arrow Lake processor. It's just as fast as the 285K in games, bar a few fps here and there, and it's not much slower in content creation as it only has four fewer threads.\n\nThe obvious choice when you're spending this kind of money for gaming, though, is the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. However, the demand is so high, that it's hard to find one at a sensible price right now. But that doesn't mean one should turn to Arrow Lake\u2014instead, just be patient and wait for stocks to improve.\n\nThat will surely happen sooner than the Core Ultra 200S becoming a decent gaming chip, at this rate.",

            "content": "Step 2: Stay the course on IFS\n\nIntel is on a multiyear mission to reinvent itself as a foundry service and compete with TSMC and Samsung. If there is a knock on Gelsinger, it\u2019s that he didn\u2019t make it abundantly clear to the board and to investors that this is a long-term project that will require time and investment before a payoff. The investment can pay off if the board and shareholders are patient, but pushing Gelsinger into retirement is not a sign of patience. And they have to be, argues Patrick Morehead, president of Moor Insights & Strategies.\n\n\u201cWhat Intel has to do is execute on the strategy that it has set out on for the last three years, and that\u2019s to get competitive in foundry and get more competitive in products. And I think on the foundry side, what I\u2019ve seen on the 18A process is good so far,\u201d Morehead said.\n\nThe 18A semiconductor manufacturing technology uses a 1.8 nanometer process node. It would be well ahead of the best that TSMC can manage for the next two years, and it would give Intel a clear competitive advantage over TSMC and Samsung. \u201cIn the end, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s getting 18A to the appropriate yield and defect density rates to be able to make a profitable business, not only supporting the Intel design company but also for external partners,\u201d said Morehead.\n\nIntel has six months to go before it hits high-volume manufacturing on 18A for internal products, and then another year before it goes into high-volume manufacturing for third parties.\n\nStep 3: Split\n\nGelsinger was trying to create a foundry business as part of Intel. But Nathan Brookwood, research fellow with Insight 64, says the company needs to split itself in half and spin off the foundry business, just like AMD did in 2008. Up until 2008, AMD made its own chips. It then decided to sell off its foundries to an Abu Dhabi investment company under the name GlobalFoundries. Today, AMD is thriving, and GlobalFoundries is the third-largest fabrication company in the world, behind Samsung and TSMC.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to a few people over the last week or two, and the general belief is that the company\u2019s too far gone to remain a single enterprise, and it\u2019s going to have to be split\u201d into a product company and a foundry, Brookwood said.",

The sweeping move, announced via executive order Monday, also sets up a potential court challenge from ex-officials seeking to maintain access to sensitive government information.\n\nWATCH: Trump discusses pardoning Jan. 6 rioters in first news conference\n\n\u201cThe president has a lot of authority when it comes to security clearances. The problem the White House will run into is, if they depart from their existing procedures, they could set up a judicial appeal for these 51 people \u2014 and it will probably be a class-action suit since they\u2019re all in alike or similar circumstances,\u201d said Dan Meyer, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the security clearance and background check process.\n\nThe executive order targets the clearances of 50 people in all, including the 49 surviving signatories of the letter. The list includes prominent officials like James Clapper, the director of national intelligence under former President Barack Obama, and John Brennan and Leon Panetta, who both served as Obama\u2019s CIA director.\n\nREAD MORE: Justice Department directs prosecutors to investigate state and local efforts to obstruct immigration enforcement\n\nAlso targeted is John Bolton, who was fired as Trump\u2019s national security adviser during his first term and later wrote a book whose publication the White House unsuccessfully sought to block on grounds that it disclosed national security information. Separately this week, Trump abruptly ended the U.S. Secret Service detail assigned to Bolton, who has been the subject of assassination plots by Iran. Bolton said in a statement that he was disappointed but not surprised by the decision.\n\nThe order directs the CIA to work with the office of the Director of National Intelligence to begin the process of revoking the clearances.\n\nIt was not clear how many of the former officials still maintain security clearances, though Mark Zaid, who represents eight people who signed the letter, said that he did not believe many did and that the Trump\u2019s action functioned largely as a \u201cpublic policy message to his right-wing base\u201d\n\nHe said he would sue the administration on behalf of any client who wanted to challenge the order.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in this that shows me, regardless of presidential authority, that this action is not subject to existing law and policy that mandates procedural and substantive due process,\u201d Zaid said. A Clinton-era executive order says people determined to be ineligible for a clearance are to be provided a \u201ccomprehensive and detailed\u201d explanation of the conclusion.\n\nAt issue is an October 2020 letter signed by former intelligence officials who raised alarms about the provenance of emails reported by The New York Post to have come from a laptop that President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, had dropped off at a Wilmington, Delaware, computer repair shop. The newspaper said it had obtained a hard drive of the laptop from longtime Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, and the communications that it published related to Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nThe signatories of the letter wrote that they didn\u2019t know whether the emails were authentic or not but that their emergence has \u201call the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe \u2014 also his current pick to lead the CIA \u2014 contradicted that assessment by saying there was no intelligence to support the idea that Russia had anything to do with Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop. The FBI, which was conducting its own criminal investigations into the younger Biden, seemed to back up Ratcliffe\u2019s statement by telling Congress in a letter it had nothing to add to what he had said.\n\nHunter Biden was subsequently convicted of both tax and gun charges, but was pardoned last month by his father.\n\nThough courts are historically reluctant to weigh in on disputes involving security clearances, the unilateral suspension by Trump is a departure from standard protocol in which individual executive branch agencies would be tasked with creating an investigation into a person\u2019s fitness for a clearance or whether it should be revoked.\n\nThroughout his first presidency, Trump fumed about an intelligence community that he believed had been politicized against him, repeatedly citing the investigation into ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign.",

            "content": "On January 21, the account @x86deadandback on the X platform revealed that traces of Intel's next-generation Nova Lake CPUs have appeared in shipping lists, indicating steady progress in its development.\n\nIntel has provided minimal information about Nova Lake, but it is anticipated to launch in 2026. It is believed that Nova Lake will take the place of Panther Lake for mobile platforms and Arrow Lake for desktop options (assuming there isn't a subsequent desktop launch after the Core Ultra 200S series).\n\nAccording to the shipping records, Intel is currently testing its next-generation consumer CPU platform, named Nova Lake. The first chip in this lineup was sent to Intel's laboratories in December 2024 for advanced testing. The Intel Nova Lake CPU series is expected to follow Panther Lake\u2014set to debut later this year\u2014and may be introduced in 2026.\n\nRumors suggest that Nova Lake could utilize two new CPU core architectures, codenamed Coyote Cove and Arctic Wolf, although the accuracy of this information has yet to be confirmed. Nova Lake holds significant importance as it is the only officially announced desktop CPU architecture following Arrow Lake. Meanwhile, Panther Lake is not aimed at desktop platforms but is instead focused entirely on mobile devices and laptops. It remains unclear whether Intel will continue using the LGA1851 platform or develop a completely new platform.\n\nSpeculation suggests that the Nova Lake series may utilize either the Intel 14A or TSMC 2nm process node, although Intel might consider outsourcing certain tiles or chips to TSMC, following the approach taken with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake. One confirmed detail about Nova Lake is that, similar to Panther Lake, it will not incorporate on-package memory, which means Lunar Lake will remain the only processor featuring this design for the foreseeable future.\n\nAnd as always, while waiting for more exciting news, remember to use our comparison tool to find the best deal for your next favorite game.",

            "content": "Hua Hong Semiconductor, China's second-largest chip foundry, has made strategic leadership changes to prioritize logic chip production and develop more advanced process technologies. The company hired Bai Peng, a veteran in logic chip technology, and appointed him president on January 1, 2024, reports Nikkei.\n\nBai Peng, who spent over three decades at Intel and led logic chip development from research to mass production, is expected to steer Hua Hong's shift toward advanced semiconductor production technologies. Hua Hong are one of China's few foundries to offer 40nm fabrication process along with SMIC. While 40nm is a fairly sophisticated technology, it cannot enable modern processors for AI, HPC, and client computing applications. The task for Bai Peng will be to advance Hua Hong's manufacturing processes. The report says that Bai's expertise aligns with the company's focus to develop fabrication nodes essential for AI and other high-end applications.\n\nHua Hong has historically focused on power semiconductors, analog chips, and embedded memory products, with most of its offerings at 100nm or larger. Hua Hong's financial performance has declined since its 2022 peak due to falling legacy chip prices, which are particularly vulnerable to market fluctuations. As a result, declining prices has pushed the company to diversify into logic chips, a market currently dominated by a few Chinese companies, including SMIC.\n\nTo expand its production capabilities, Hua Hong acquired a former GlobalFoundries facility in Chengdu, China, in 2023 and began operations in 2024. Additionally, a new plant in Wuxi is now producing chips of 40nm and above. These expansions aim to position Hua Hong as a key player in both legacy and advanced chip markets.\n\nHua Hong held approximately 2% of the global foundry market during the third quarter of 2023, according to TrendForce. For now, the share is small, but the company certainly wants to change that. STMicroelectronics, a leading European chipmaker, announced plans to outsource some production to Hua Hong last year, which highlights the increasing recognition of Hua Hong's manufacturing capabilities.\n\nThe parent company, Huahong Group, has also undergone leadership changes. Tang Junjun, previously president, was promoted to chairman. Tang brings extensive experience from his tenure at a joint venture between Huahong Group and NEC. Additionally, Qin Jian, who led Shanghai Alliance Investment \u2014 a significant Hua Hong shareholder \u2014 became the parent group\u2019s chairman in December 2023.\n\nThese appointments have fueled speculation about a potential collaboration between Hua Hong and SMIC, China's largest and most advanced foundry. Such a partnership could bolster China's efforts to build a self-reliant semiconductor ecosystem, reducing dependency on foreign supply chains.",

Wall Street's cocaine nose jobs have already reacted positively to the development, with Intel's shares rising by nearly 10 per cent.\n\nSince Intel started going down the gurgler, there have been several approaches from different companies that want to buy Intel\u2019s bits. In September 2024, Qualcomm approached Intel with a proposal to buy out the company\u2019s business.\n\nIntel had a rough 2024, with its stock falling by 54 per cent over the past year and 69 per cent since April 2021. The company faces struggles in both its data centre business and its attempts to compete in the foundry business.\n\nThe rise of AI has led companies to prefer GPUs from NVIDIA over Intel\u2019s CPUs. Intel also struggles to compete with Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor in manufacturing chips for other companies, failing to stay on the cutting edge of technology and attracting new customers.\n\nOne major debate in the semiconductor industry is whether Intel should split up its \u2018Integrated Device Manufacturer\u2019 model, which designs its chips and offers manufacturing services to other companies.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has achieved a dominant market share by only manufacturing chips, reducing the risk for companies like AMD, who might otherwise be hesitant to use Intel\u2019s services. The geopolitical concerns about Taiwan\u2019s position also highlight the importance of Intel\u2019s foundry business to the United States.\n\nBuilding advanced foundries is an expensive endeavour. Taiwan Semiconductor plans to spend $40 billion this year, while Intel spent $26 billion in 2023 and $25 billion in 2022.\n\nHowever, Chipzilla has only $24 billion in cash compared to $50 billion in debt, and its operating cash flow has significantly decreased from $36 billion in 2020 to $9.7 billion over the past year. Intel can\u2019t afford to keep investing in its foundry business.\n\nMusk\u2019s new AI company, xAI, aims to build a data centre with one million networked GPUs, making him a key figure in addressing the risks of not having a domestic capacity for advanced chip manufacturing. Potential solutions could involve Qualcomm buying parts of Intel\u2019s business and Musk providing capital to the foundry business.\n\nAlthough these are just speculations, such a deal could help Intel navigate its current challenges.",

Later in the week, sentiment received a further boost after a report surfaced that the company might be a takeover target.\n\nIntel shares were up 2.5% at around $22 in early-afternoon trading Tuesday. Despite the recent rally, the stock has lost more than half its value over the past 12 months amid investor skepticism about the company's ability to capture a greater share of the booming artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\n\nBelow, we break down the technicals on Intel\u2019s weekly chart and point out crucial price levels worth watching out for.\n\nBullish Engulfing Pattern Points to Possible Double Bottom\n\nIntel shares staged an impressive reversal last week to form a bullish engulfing pattern, a two-bar candlestick formation that signals a positive shift in investor sentiment. Importantly, the pattern formed around the same location on the chart as the early-September low, setting the stage for a potential double bottom.\n\nFurthermore, last week\u2019s rally occurred on the highest weekly volume since early December, indicating buying conviction from larger market participants, such as institutional investors and hedge funds.\n\nLet\u2019s identify three overhead areas that investors may be watching if the chipmaker\u2019s stock moves higher and also point out a key support level to track if the stock gives back last week\u2019s gains.\n\nCrucial Overhead Areas to Follow\n\nFollow-through buying could initially see the shares climb to around $25. This area on the chart may provide resistance near the October 2022 and February 2023 troughs, which also closely align with the the November 2024 peak.\n\nA decisive close above this area may see the shares climb to the $30 mark. Investors could seek exit points here near a trendline that connects a range of comparable highs and lows on the chart from September 2022 to June last year. This region also roughly aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level when stretching a grid from the December 2023 high to September 2024 low.\n\nMore bullish price action could propel a move up to around $37, a location where the shares may run into selling pressure near the closely watched 200-day moving average and a horizontal line that links a series of comparable trading levels on the chart between June 2022 and July last year.\n\nKey Support Level to Track\n\nFinally, the bulls\u2019 failure to defend recent gains could see the shares revisit significant lows around $19. Investors who chase bottoms could look for buying opportunities around the prominent September and January troughs.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

            "content": "Shares of Intel (INTC 0.63%) were a massive disappointment in 2024. Multiple missteps culminated with the surprise retirement of CEO Pat Gelsinger late last year, and the company is now led by interim co-CEOs without a clear strategy. Investors are right to be skeptical of an Intel turnaround.\n\nWhile management could start to turn things around this year, there are multiple major risks that could further derail the stock.\n\nEverything is riding on Intel 18A\n\nIntel 18A is the fifth and final process node in Intel's five-nodes-in-four-years manufacturing plan. The company has laid out its post-18A road map, but Intel 18A is likely to make or break the company's foundry business.\n\nThe chipmaker has made progress catching up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing in terms of manufacturing technology over the past few years, and Intel 18A is supposed to push it back into the lead, or at the very least get it back to parity. It features a new type of transistor and will be the first process available to use backside power delivery, a feature that can meaningfully improve performance and efficiency.\n\nA handful of major buyers for Intel 18A have been announced, but the pace of customer wins has been slow. To justify the massive investments necessary to bring Intel 18A up to volume production, the company is going to need to score more customer wins sooner rather than later. With interim co-CEOs running things right now, potential customers may not be too keen to commit to it for manufacturing.\n\nBeyond the foundry business, multiple upcoming product lines are set to use Intel 18A for manufacturing. Any delay or issues with the process would not only be a setback for the foundry but also derail products that the company will need to get right to win back market share. Those include Clearwater Forest in server central processing units (CPUs) and Panther Lake in the PC CPU market.\n\nIf Intel 18A fails, the comeback will be in serious jeopardy.\n\nStumbles in the PC market\n\nIntel is facing two distinct problems in the desktop CPU market. First, the company's previous-generation Raptor Lake chips, while powerful, suffered from embarrassing stability issues that forced it to extend warranties.\n\nSecond, Arrow Lake, the company's latest desktop chips, perform worse than Raptor Lake and competing CPUs from AMD in gaming workloads. While Arrow Lake does well in other areas, poor gaming performance is an albatross around its neck.\n\nEven after a series of software fixes meant to improve Arrow Lake's gaming performance, the new chips are still unappealing for PC gamers. The website Tom's Hardware found that the fixes actually make Arrow Lake relatively less competitive because they also improve performance for Intel's older chips.\n\nWhile gaming represents only a portion of the desktop CPU market, the bad press around Arrow Lake is a real problem that isn't going to go away. That spells trouble for Intel's client computing segment.\n\nFalling behind in AI\n\nOn paper, the company's Gaudi line of artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators offers an attractive value proposition. Unfortunately, immature software has hindered adoption. Intel had originally set a goal of selling $500 million worth of AI accelerators in 2024, a paltry number compared to the overall size of the market. It managed to fall short of that target.\n\nIntel's AI accelerator road map is complicated, with the company planning to essentially merge Gaudi with its data center GPUs into a new product line that's a traditional GPU that integrates Gaudi's features. Long story short, 2025 isn't likely to be a great year for its AI chip business. AMD is doing much better than Intel in this area, so there are really no excuses.\n\nAI accelerators could easily be a multibillion-dollar business for Intel if not for the company's poor execution. As it faces challenges on multiple fronts, the lack of a sizable AI accelerator business could drag down the stock as investors focus on other AI plays.\n\nIs Intel stock a buy?\n\nWhile Intel is going through an unprecedented crisis, it could still make sense to bet on a turnaround. Its manufacturing assets are valuable, and the company remains the only U.S.-based advanced logic semiconductor manufacturer. The stock currently trades below book value, an indication that investors are incredibly pessimistic about the prospects of the once-untouchable semiconductor giant.\n\nIf the Intel 18A process is delivered on time and lives up to its potential, a comeback could begin in earnest as early as this year. If, however, the all-important process node disappoints in any way, Intel stock could be stuck in the doldrums for the foreseeable future.",

Following two years of deceleration in auto parts aftermarket demand, cyclical headwinds will abate in 2025, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nMorgan Stanley upgraded Qorvo (QRVO) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $106, up from $90. Qorvo has struggled to achieve its margin targets, but the activist influence \"could inject some urgency,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nMorgan Stanley upgraded Ulta Beauty (ULTA) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $500, up from $430. The firm believes Ulta's share gains within beauty should improve in 2025 from its 2024 bottom, and says the company's sales and margin expectations are reasonable for 2025.\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded General Motors (GM) to Buy from Hold with a $60 price target into the Q4 report. The firm cites GM's recent strategic moves in China and Cruise, its \"consistent track record of execution,\" and \"aggressive\" share buyback trajectory for the upgrade.\n\nHSBC upgraded Intel (INTC) to Hold from Reduce with a $20 price target. The firm believes the stock is now fairly priced, as recent uncertainties relating to execution of the \"IDM 2.0\" strategy as well as top management attrition are reflected in the shares.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\n\n\nJefferies downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Underperform from Hold with a price target of $200.75, down from $211.84. The firm reduced forecasts to reflect \"weak\" iPhone sales and the general consumer electronics market. Loop Capital also downgraded Apple to Hold from Buy with a $230 price target after the firm's supply chain checks suggested a \"material\" iPhone demand reduction that the firm sees beginning in the March-end quarter and then \"materially amplifying\" in the June and September quarters.\n\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Ross Stores (ROST) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $140, down from $164. Against record gross margins, the firm thinks soft lines profitability expansion \"will be harder to come by\" in 2025, which places the burden on sales growth acceleration and/or expense reduction.\n\nJefferies downgraded Mondelez (MDLZ) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $62, down from $75. The firm's work on cocoa makes it more cautious on Mondelez than it was in 2024.\n\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Yum! Brands (YUM) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $140, down from $158. Yum's international exposure, long an advantage, has been a \"mixed bag\" in 2024, and that will continue in 2025, the firm tells investors in a research note.",

Nova Lake is the successor to Intel's Arrow Lake series of processors and is expected to debut in 2026-27. While the manifests don't reveal any key details, it is essential to understand that final specifications are still subject to change.\n\nGoing by whispers in the wind, Nova Lake is rumored to employ Coyote Cove P-cores (renamed from Panther Cove) alongside Arctic Wolf E-cores. It is unclear where these architectures currently stand in Intel's product stack, so we cannot comment on any performance metrics. Ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger confirmed that most of Nova Lake will be produced in-house, likely on Intel 18A, with only a handful of SKUs expected to be outsourced.\n\nThe shipping manifest includes a single entry dating back to December 9th last year, reportedly marked as \"FOC,\" which should stand for Free Of Charge. The listing explicitly tags the item as a \"Microprocessor\" and a \"Test Chip\" labeled \"NVL,\" shorthand for Nova Lake. Last month, Wildcat Lake reball jigs surfaced similarly at NBD.\n\nArrow Lake suffers from poor L3 access latency due to an off-die memory controller and a slow ring bus which cripples performance in memory-sensitive applications. A leak alleges that Panther Lake will reintegrate the IMC (Integrated Memory Controller) back into the CPU Tile, similar to Lunar Lake. Likewise, Nova Lake is said to separate the two once again but with added optimizations.\n\nNova Lake is expected to require a new socket, and unless Intel ports Panther Lake to a desktop, LGA 1851 could be one of the shortest-lived platforms in Intel's history. In addition, Linux patches indicate Intel is actively developing software support for upcoming CPU generations, including Nova Lake and its supposed successor, \"Razor Lake.\"\n\nNext-gen E-core-only Clearwater Forest chips will feature Intel's \"Local Cache\" technology, designed to compete with AMD's V-Cache. CPU chiplets, expected to feature the cores and private caches, are placed on top of a Base tile. This Base tile can be configured with varying amounts of shared L3 cache. Sadly, this technology will remain exclusive to Intel's server counterparts for now but could someday make its way to consumer offerings.",

Intel has a lot riding on the success of its 18A node, not only for its own chips but also in terms of its utilization from 3rd parties. While Panther Lake is now scheduled for mass production in the second half of 2025, another key product will be making its way to consumer platforms shortly after, and that's Nova Lake.\n\nIntel Panther Lake CPUs will mostly focus on the mobility side of things, with the desktop updates limited to integration of the same mobile chip inside Mini PCs. It will be similar to Meteor Lake, but it did end up getting a desktop release in the form of the \"PS\" series for Edge platforms. So there's still a possibility of Panther Lake seeing a similar desktop launch, but we will see.\n\nWith that said, let's talk about Nova Lake. Intel has offered little to no details regarding Nova Lake, but we know it will launch sometime in 2026. It is expected that Nova Lake will replace Panther Lake for mobility platforms and Arrow Lake for desktop platforms (in the case there's no desktop release after the Core Ultra 200S series).\n\nRumors allege that the Nova Lake lineup will utilize either the Intel 14A or TSMC 2nm process node, but the blue team may opt to outsource certain tiles or certain chips to TSMC as they have done with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake. One thing that we do know about Nova Lake is that, like Panther Lake, it won't feature on-package memory, leaving Lunar Lake as the only chip to utilize such a design for the foreseeable future.\n\nImage Source: NBD.ltd\n\nAlthough the listing isn't recent since it's a month old, the appearance of an Intel Nova Lake test chip confirms the fact that the blue team is currently deep at work on its next-gen consumer CPU platform which will replace 2025's Panther Lake platform. Once again, we can't wait to see Nova Lake in action, but before that, we have to see Panther Lake and how it pans out. Rumors have also pointed out that the successor to Nova Lake-S will be called Razor Lake-S.\n\nIntel Desktop CPU Generations Comparison:",

The card has a 100HZ overclock on the GPU, and from The FPS Review\u2019s testing the rated 2600MHz GPU Boost clock is nowhere near the upper limit for this card. ASRock put a lot of effort into the cooling on this card, the temperature of the GPU never exceeded 62c, and the memory temperature peaked at 68c while maintaining a rock solid 2750MHz frequency on that GPU.\n\nYou will get impressive performance at 1080p without ray tracing enabled, when you enable ray tracing you will find that the card struggles and cannot reach 60fps in most games. That is expected for a card at this price point, and we may even see the card approach playable results with driver updates. At 1440p, even with XeSS enabled, you are not going to enjoy most games. With the exception of the new S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game, the Challenger 10GB OC can\u2019t quite make playable average frame rates.

            "content": "We recently reviewed Intel's Arc B580, a new budget GPU designed to deliver RTX 4060-like performance featuring 12GB of VRAM for just $250. Our review included testing across 12 games, and for the most part, the Arc B580 performed extremely well.\n\nHowever, after that review was published, it was discovered that the Arc B580 has a rather serious CPU overhead issue that affects performance in CPU-limited games when paired with a slower processor, such as the Ryzen 5 5600.\n\nWe've since retested the Intel GPU with less capable CPUs, and in short, while the Arc B580 is still very usable with a CPU like the 5600, it does struggle in CPU-demanding games, resulting in noticeably slower performance than we initially expected. This obviously hurts the overall value of Intel's GPU.\n\nThe overhead issue was discovered before we completed all the testing for this review unfortunately, which uses the Ryzen 7 9800X3D to remove any potential CPU bottleneck.\n\nHowever, in light of this discovery, we decided to release all the data we spent weeks gathering, as it provides valuable insight into how well the B580 performs relative to the RTX 4060 across a massive range of games. In total, we tested 50 games, so there is plenty of data to examine and also if you are interested in a specific title that you like to play, there are better odds that we have benchmarked it here.\n\nTypically, we would summarize all the gaming benchmarks for about a dozen titles and present the percentage breakdown in a single graph. However, since the B580's performance can vary significantly, we felt it would be worthwhile to review all 50 graphs. So, prepare yourself \u2013 there's a lot of blue bar graphs to go through. Let's dive in!\n\nBenchmarks\n\nFortnite\n\nAfter playing a few games in Fortnite with the Arc B580, which allows the shader compilation process to complete, performance was quite good. While it didn't outperform the RTX 4060, it was still more than adequate for competitive settings, achieving 218 fps at 1080p and 160 fps at 1440p.\n\nHorizon Forbidden West\n\nThe Arc B580 excelled in Horizon Forbidden West, delivering an average frame rate almost 20% higher than the RTX 4060. It was an impressive 42% faster when comparing 1% lows, likely due to the GeForce GPU's limited 8GB VRAM buffer.\n\nAt 1440p, this issue became more pronounced, with the B580 outperforming the 4060 by 56% on average and boosting 1% lows by 113%. The B580 delivered smooth gameplay, while the RTX 4060 suffered from significant stuttering.\n\nRemnant II\n\nPerformance in Remnant II was more competitive. The B580 was 7% faster at 1080p and 18% faster at 1440p. However, to achieve 60 fps or higher, users may need to enable upscaling or lower some visual settings slightly.\n\nRainbow Six Siege\n\nIn Rainbow Six Siege, the B580 fell behind the RTX 4060, despite offering decent overall performance. At 1080p, it was 22% slower than the 4060, although this margin shrank to 7% at 1440p.\n\nAssassin's Creed Mirage\n\nThe B580 also underperformed in Assassin's Creed Mirage, trailing the 4060 by 14% at 1080p and 8% at 1440p. Additionally, the 1% lows were nearly 20% lower on the B580.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6\n\nUsing the basic quality preset for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the B580 was noticeably slower than the RTX 4060. At 1080p, it was 22% slower, and at 1440p, it lagged behind by 21%. While overall performance was decent with reduced quality settings, it was disappointing compared to the RTX 4060.\n\nRatchet & Clank: Rift Apart\n\nThe B580 fared much better in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, outperforming the RTX 4060 by 15% at 1080p and 16% at 1440p, delivering a solid performance boost.\n\nThe Last of Us Part I\n\nThe B580 performed well in The Last of Us Part I, especially at 1440p, where its 12GB VRAM buffer allowed it to handle 'Ultra' quality settings smoothly. It outperformed the RTX 4060 by a significant 29% in average frame rates and a massive 110% in 1% lows.\n\nCounter-Strike 2\n\nWhile the B580 delivered solid performance in Counter-Strike 2, it was still slower than the RTX 4060, trailing by 17% at 1080p and 9% at 1440p. However, at 1440p, the B580 showed higher 1% lows compared to the RTX 4060.\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor\n\nThe B580 handled Star Wars Jedi: Survivor well, achieving 79 fps at 1080p and 51 fps at 1440p with the maximum quality preset. This made it 7% faster than the 4060 at 1080p and 16% faster at 1440p.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3\n\nIn Baldur's Gate 3, the B580 lagged slightly behind the RTX 4060, rendering 81 fps at 1080p, making it 6% slower, and 5% slower at 1440p.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle showcased interesting results. The B580 was just 2% faster than the RTX 4060 in average frame rates but 56% faster in 1% lows. This difference highlights the limitations of the RTX 4060's 8GB VRAM. Similar trends were observed at 1440p, further emphasizing the importance of sufficient VRAM for this title.\n\nF1 24\n\nThe B580 handled F1 24 effortlessly. Although it wasn't noticeably faster than the RTX 4060, it powered through the game using the high preset, delivering a smooth high-refresh-rate experience even at 1440p.\n\nForza Horizon 5\n\nSimilar to F1 24, the Arc GPU excelled in Forza Horizon 5, delivering 6% better performance at 1080p with an average of 109 fps. At 1440p, performance improved by 10%, although 1% lows were slightly less consistent.\n\nResident Evil 4\n\nThe B580 performed well in Resident Evil 4, beating the RTX 4060 by an 8% margin at 1080p and 13% at 1440p, maintaining frame rates well above 60 fps.\n\nStarfield\n\nUnfortunately, the B580 struggled in Starfield, with weak average frame rates and extremely poor 1% lows. Not only was it significantly slower than the RTX 4060, but the experience was subpar, rendering the game practically unplayable at a satisfactory standard.\n\nThe Callisto Protocol\n\nPerformance in The Callisto Protocol was much better, with the B580 outperforming the 4060 by 6% at 1080p and 12% at 1440p.\n\nAlan Wake 2\n\nIn Alan Wake 2, previous testing with ray tracing showed that neither the B580 nor the RTX 4060 could deliver playable performance. With ray tracing disabled and high-quality settings enabled, the B580 achieved just 43 fps at 1080p, making it 9% slower than the RTX 4060. Performance in this title remains underwhelming.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty\n\nThe B580 performed exceptionally well in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. It was 15% faster than the RTX 4060 at 1080p and an impressive 29% faster at 1440p, making it a clear win for Intel.\n\nFar Cry 6\n\nThe Arc B580 delivered mixed results in Far Cry 6. While average frame rates appeared decent, frame rate consistency was poor, with very low 1% lows, resulting in a less-than-ideal experience.\n\nMarvel's Spider-Man Remastered\n\nThe B580 shined in Spider-Man Remastered, delivering 20% better performance than the RTX 4060 at 1080p and 25% at 1440p, providing a significantly improved experience.\n\nAvatar: Frontiers of Pandora\n\nThe B580 edged out the RTX 4060 in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, with a 3% performance gain at 1080p and a 7% advantage at 1440p, along with 17% stronger 1% lows.\n\nHitman 3\n\nPerformance in Hitman 3 was excellent, with the B580 delivering 145 fps at 1080p using the highest quality settings (excluding ray tracing). It was 12% faster than the RTX 4060 at 1080p and an impressive 27% faster at 1440p.\n\nDying Light 2 Stay Human\n\nThe B580 performed well in Dying Light 2 Stay Human, beating the RTX 4060 at both resolutions. It was 17% faster at 1080p and 25% faster at 1440p, providing a noticeably better experience, especially at the higher resolution.\n\nHogwarts Legacy\n\nThe B580 handled Hogwarts Legacy well, matching the RTX 4060 at 1080p. At 1440p, it was 11% faster, improving from 53 fps to 59 fps on average, a difference players will appreciate.\n\nA Plague Tale: Requiem\n\nThe B580 excelled in A Plague Tale: Requiem, achieving 77 fps at 1080p, making it 20% faster than the RTX 4060. At 1440p, its lead extended to 24%, providing a noticeably better experience.\n\nDragon Age: The Veilguard\n\nPerformance in Dragon Age: The Veilguard was mixed. At 1080p, the B580 was 15% slower, a significant margin. However, at 1440p, it managed to pull ahead by 8%.\n\nWar Thunder\n\nThe B580 performed well in War Thunder, outperforming the RTX 4060 by 7% at 1080p and 16% at 1440p, with no issues expected even at 4K.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2\n\nPerformance in Space Marine 2 was uneven. At 1080p, the B580 was 16% slower than the RTX 4060, but it remained perfectly playable. At 1440p, performance improved significantly, with the B580 surpassing the 4060 by 6%.\n\nStar Wars Outlaws\n\nStar Wars Outlaws uses ray tracing effects by default, which heavily impacts frame rates on the ultra preset. The B580 managed 40 fps at 1080p, making it 18% faster than the RTX 4060, but performance still leaves room for improvement.\n\nAssetto Corsa Competizione\n\nPerformance in Assetto Corsa Competizione (ACC) was solid overall, though the B580 trailed the RTX 4060 by 20% at 1080p and 25% at 1440p. This was somewhat surprising, as the Arc GPU typically narrows the performance gap at higher resolutions.\n\nBlack Myth Wukong\n\nWith ray tracing disabled, Black Myth Wukong played exceptionally well on the B580 using the medium quality preset. It achieved 79 fps at 1080p and 64 fps at 1440p, outperforming the RTX 4060 by 20% and 45%, respectively.\n\nBorderlands 3\n\nThe B580 also delivered superior performance in Borderlands 3, though the margins were narrower. It was 11% faster at 1080p and 17% faster at 1440p.\n\nTotal War: Warhammer III\n\nThe B580 handled Total War: Warhammer III with ease, outperforming the RTX 4060 by 7% at 1080p and 9% at 1440p.\n\nDelta Force\n\nPerformance in Delta Force was mixed. While the B580 achieved better average frame rates than the RTX 4060, frame time performance was inconsistent, with notably poor 1% lows. This made gameplay less smooth and more frustrating, despite the decent averages.\n\nDragon's Dogma 2\n\nPerformance in Dragon's Dogma 2 was underwhelming. The B580 rendered 61 fps at 1080p, but frame time consistency was lacking. Compared to the RTX 4060, the B580 was 22% slower at 1080p and 17% slower at 1440p.\n\nGears 5\n\nThe B580 struggled in Gears 5, falling significantly behind the RTX 4060. Retesting confirmed the results: the B580 was 34% slower at 1080p and 31% slower at 1440p. While the game remained playable at 'ultra' settings, this performance is disappointing and something Intel may need to address.\n\nGod of War Ragnar\u00f6k\n\nThe B580 delivered mixed results in God of War Ragnar\u00f6k. At 1080p, it was 14% slower than the RTX 4060 but had similar 1% lows. At 1440p, it edged ahead by 3%, again with comparable 1% lows. Overall performance was solid but inconsistent.\n\nGotham Knights\n\nPerformance in Gotham Knights was highly competitive, with the B580 and RTX 4060 delivering nearly identical results at both 1080p and 1440p using the highest quality preset.\n\nHalo Infinite\n\nHalo Infinite remains a weak point for Intel Arc GPUs, and the B580 is no exception. While the game loads and plays without major technical issues, performance was disappointing, coming in 31% slower than the RTX 4060 at 1080p and 24% slower at 1440p.\n\nHomeworld 3\n\nThe B580 also struggled in Homeworld 3, performing 22% slower than the RTX 4060 at 1080p and 13% slower at 1440p. The 1% lows were particularly problematic, showing a 37% reduction compared to the 4060, leading to noticeable performance dips.\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn\n\nResults for Horizon Zero Dawn were mixed. The B580 was 11% slower than the RTX 4060 at 1080p but 8% faster at 1440p, with similar 1% lows at both resolutions. Overall performance was acceptable, though not consistently better than the 4060.\n\nHunt Showdown 1896\n\nPerformance in Hunt Showdown 1896 was disappointing. Despite solid average frame rates, the game suffered from constant and severe frame stuttering. Multiple retests produced the same results, rendering the experience frustrating and unreliable.\n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024\n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 proved challenging for both GPUs, as neither managed 30 fps at 1080p without lowering quality settings or enabling upscaling. At 1080p, the B580 was 17% slower than the RTX 4060. At 1440p, performance fell short of acceptable levels altogether.\n\nReturnal\n\nNext up is Returnal, where the B580 performed very well, delivering 14% better performance at 1080p and 22% at 1440p. This is an easy win for the Arc GPU, offering excellent performance overall using the Epic preset.\n\nThe Riftbreaker\n\nThe B580 also excelled in The Riftbreaker, beating the RTX 4060 by 14% at 1080p and 20% at 1440p.\n\nRocket League\n\nWhile the B580 lags slightly behind in Rocket League, overall performance remains excellent. At 1080p, it was 7% slower than the RTX 4060 and, somewhat surprisingly, 16% slower at 1440p.\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\n\nIn Shadow of the Tomb Raider, the two GPUs traded blows. The B580 was 6% slower at 1080p but 5% faster at 1440p. Performance overall was similar, and since this is an older title, gameplay was excellent using the highest in-game preset.\n\nStalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl\n\nStalker 2 is one of the newest games in this test suite, and the B580 struggled slightly, performing 15% slower than the RTX 4060 at 1080p and 10% slower at 1440p.\n\nSkull and Bones\n\nFinally, there's Skull and Bones, a game that few people have played. We included it for completeness, but it appears Intel overlooked it too, as the B580 couldn't even load the game, crashing every time it tried to load a level. This gives the RTX 4060 a clear win here, though Intel is aware of the issue and will likely resolve it in a future driver update.\n\n1080p Average Performance\n\nThis is interesting. The 12 games we used for evaluating GPUs in our day-one review showed the B580 to be 7% faster than the RTX 4060 on average at 1080p. However, when testing a much larger range of games, the B580 is actually 1% slower than the 4060.\n\nWhile a 7% margin was never substantial, these results highlight just how much performance can vary depending on the title. The Intel B580 performed particularly poorly in Gears 5, Halo Infinite, Rainbow Six Siege, Black Ops 6, Homeworld 3, and Starfield. Among these, only Starfield was part of the original review.\n\nHunt Showdown was also problematic for the B580, though it appeared better than some of the others due to its excellent average frame rate. If we exclude Hunt Showdown, the B580 becomes 2% slower than the RTX 4060. However, this cuts both ways, as several titles exposed the RTX 4060's insufficient VRAM, resulting in shockingly poor 1% lows.\n\nUltimately, when considering a large range of games, the B580 and RTX 4060 are much more evenly matched.\n\n1440p Average Performance\n\nAs we also saw previously, that the B580 stacks up best at 1440p and here we see that it's 5% faster on average across a massive range of games, which is well down on the 14% margin seen in our day one review.\n\nYou could argue that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is an outlier here, but removing it only changes the margin to 7%, so half what was seen in the day one review.\n\nWhat We Learned\n\nIn our day-one review of the the Arc B580 which included 12 games, the Intel GPU was found to offer 27% better value than Nvidia's RTX 4060 when measuring cost per frame. However, with this updated data across a much larger game sample, the value advantage shrinks to around 21%.\n\nHaving that said, this comparison assumes the use of a high-end flagship CPU. When swapping the 9800X3D for the 5600, the B580's value proposition significantly diminishes. Because of this, it's difficult to gauge the performance differences between the B580 and RTX 4060 using a smaller sample of games as Arc's performance remains inconsistent, often due to its overhead issue.\n\nIntel still has work to do, but the good news is that there's significant room for improvement. This gives hope that Intel can fully unlock the B580's potential. It was a pleasant surprise to find the testing relatively issue-free, with only a few games experiencing frame pacing problems and one game currently not working. Despite of this, the Intel Arc program has come a long way.\n\nBuilding on the conclusions from our Arc B580 reviews, this new benchmark data doesn't drastically alter our assessment. The Intel GPU is still more likely to encounter performance issues compared to the more established Radeon RX 7600 and RTX 4060, which is why we believe a 20% discount is justified.\n\nThe fact remains that if you're looking to spend less than $300 on a new GPU, there's no better choice than the Arc B580 \u2013 provided you can actually find one for $250 and have a decent CPU to pair it with. Those savings sometimes come with minor headaches. But for the most part, the experience should be positive, and having a GPU armed with 12GB of VRAM is a huge plus moving forward.\n\nThe only real problem with the Arc B580 is its current availability, that and pricing in some regions where it's not as competitive what we see in U.S. retailers. For the B580 to truly succeed, Intel needs to address both of these issues, so fingers crossed things can improve on that front.\n\nShopping Shortcuts:",

            "content": "The AI PC era is set to change everything, but it is starting with names. HP now calls its Spectre x360 the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14, which is supposed to make everything easier to understand. 'Omni' means all, so we are under the impression that this brand can do many things \u2013 though it is specifically attributed to the inclusion of generative AI capabilities.\n\nPreviously ITPro reviewed the OmniBook Ultra 14, which came with an AMD Ryzen processor, here we have a flip-screen Intel model with a stylus, which will set you back $1,600 with 16GB RAM and 1TB of storage. Our review unit, the UK version, came with 32GB RAM and 2TB storage for \u00a32,000.\n\nHP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14: Design\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe OmniBook Ultra Flip, as the name suggests, is a convertible laptop with a fold-over hinge that lets you use it in tablet mode. The chassis is largely built with recycled metal, though there is also some recycled plastic in there, but the build feels nice and solid. Minimal flex in the lid, strong hinges, and a professional look overall (particularly in midnight blue). It has those angled rear edges with USB-C ports, like its predecessors \u2013 though it is proving hit and miss according to other reviews.\n\nSimilarities with the 2024 Spectre x360 are plenty apparent. Starting with size, its 12.35 x 8.51 x 0.59in dimensions are almost exactly like, as is its weight of 1.34kg. However, the keyboard is noticeably different with its retooled Function row and the stylish thin light-blue power button in the top corner. There are also some neat little touches here and there, such as the various logos for OmniBook and PolyStudio on the edges and at corners. All in all, it is a very fashionable little work tool.\n\nHP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14: Display\n\nWith its ability to flip the screen into a tent or tablet mode, the display on the OmniBook Ultra Flip clearly needs to pack a vivid punch of color and quality. Thankfully it doesn't disappoint, with crisp visuals and a bright panel.\n\nWith our colorimeter, the OmniBook Flip showcased 98.1% for coverage and 154% for volume in the sRGB gamut color space \u2013 both much higher than the AMD-powered OmniBook Ultra 14. What's more, its 89.1% Adobe score also suggests a display capable of handling color work. Here we heartedly agreed, having spent lots of time editing images in Photoshop. The replication of color is brilliant and the whole panel is vivid. This is largely helped by its brightness, which we measured at 432.60 cd/m2 with our colorimeter. While that is a good score, it is worth noting that the M3 MacBook Pro could go even brighter at 633cd/m2.\n\nWhile those scores look good, the display was not as seamless as it could have been during our review; when it comes to orientation, there was no automatic change when you switched from normal to tablet mode. On one occasion we turned it on and the screen was in portrait. That could well have been just our review unit which had its rotation lock fixed on.\n\nHP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14: Keyboard and trackpad\n\nThe fittingly named Spectre looms large over the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14's keyboard, as it is quite similar \u2013 which is no complaint from us. There are one or two stylistic changes, such as the light grey shade of the Function row, a dedicated calculator button replacing the camera privacy one, and that blue power-on button in the top corner. All the keys, aside from the Function and arrow ones, are large and have neat and tidy labeling. The keys themselves are punchy, with decent feedback, though they feel quite shallow \u2013 our fingers occasionally met the hard underneath a few times.\n\nSimilarly, the trackpad is also good, but again, it's like the one on the 2024 Spectre. It's 6.25in diagonally, great for basic navigation and multi-touch gestures, though the haptic intensity is a touch stronger than we would have liked. This can be fine-tuned in the settings, however.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nHP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14: Specs and Performance\n\nInside the OmniBook Ultra Flip is a Luna Lake Core Ultra chip \u2013 the Ultra 7 258V \u2013 which is paired with 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. You can save some money by opting for 16GB RAM and or 1TB storage. However, you will be sacrificing some performance.\n\nHolding up its scores to the Dell XPS 13, which uses a similar Luna Lake Ultra processor, the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 comes out pretty well. We can't say the same for the M3 MacBook Pro, as that seems to trump most when it comes to benchmarks. But the OmniBook Ultra Flips still offers impressive performance. In Geekbench 6 is notched up a single core score of 1,502 and a multi-core score of 8,907. XPS hit 2,307 for the single-core tests and 11,652 for the multi-core one, putting it only slightly above the Flip.\n\nIn our lopped video test, where we played the same 20 minutes of a movie repeatedly with the display's brightness set at 170 cd/m2, the Ultra Flip lasted 11hrs and 13mins. Which is somewhere in between an average and a good battery life. In real terms the machine lasted all day for most of the time we spent with it, only once did we notice any rapid battery depletion and that was the day we tested the screen and processor.\n\nHP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14: Features\n\nThe Flip version of the Ultra 14 has slightly more features than the standard model, mainly in the form of its different orientations and the bundled-in stylus. The pen is a nice size, connects magnetically to the sides of the device, and, like the power-on button, has a cool-looking thin LED light.\n\nWe do have some complaints about the stylus; one being that you need to charge it separately. There is a USB-C slot at the end, rather than taking charge while connected to the laptop, like you find on most tablets and 2-in-1s. And it isn't the most life-like representation of drawing \u2013 seems like it is very far behind what one finds on an e-ink tablet or even a Samsung tablet.\n\nElsewhere, the Flip comes with Wi-Fi 7 (BE201), Bluetooth 5.4, one headphone jack, one USB Type-C, and two Thunderbolt 4 slots with USB Type-C \u2013 these are the previously mentioned corner ports that seem to divide users. Our experience is fairly positive, we found the angle useful for connecting a monitor and or using it for charging, but we can see that some desk setups might make it an awkward position.\n\nHP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14: Is it worth it?\n\nThere are a few different options for the 14in OmniBook Ultra; you can have it in different formats or with different processors. However, the Intel-powered Flip model is a solid choice, with its fast Ultra 7 chip, colorful display, and comfortable keyboard. Although its benchmarks were strong, we can't say this format is more useful than just a standard laptop when it comes to work. You'll need to ask yourself if the stylus is something you really need \u2013 though the Ultra Flip does work surprisingly well with image editing. In summary, the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is not quite 'Ultra', as such, but it is still very good.\n\nHP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 specifications",

The latest report out of SemiAccurate, however, claims a new potential buyer (or buyers) have emerged. Though the report by SemiAccurate confirms Intel is an acquisition target, it also expressed uncertainty about whether the information represented a concrete \"plan of action or just a CEO tossing ideas out.\"The impetus for SemiAccurate's report was an email that claimed a particular company wanted to \"buy Intel outright\". Additonal emails lended credence to the idea. SemiAccurate revealed that with the first email, there was a 60% chance of an Intel buyout, but it got further confirmation from another email, which was said to be from a \u201chighly placed source.\" This increased their confidence in the original email to more than 90%. It added that the unnamed company has the resources to complete the purchase of Intel.Interestingly,Dylan Patel, identified Elon Musk this weekend as a person of interest in this potential purchase. In a tweet on X, he suggested that the gathering of Elon Musk, and representatives from Global Foundries and chipmaker Qualcomm at Mar-a-Lago, was potentially about discussions surrounding Intel.If what Dylan suggests is accurate, Elon's potential acquisition, or involvement in an acquisition, of Intel is unlikely to be made public at the early stages. Keeping such negotiations confidential early on makes strategic sense not only to keep other potenital interested parties at bay, but because of the national security implications surrounding Intel.For now, no report has verified Elon's potential role in Intel's future. However, given his influence in the tech space and connection to President Donald Trump , it is reasonable to speculate that Intel will benefit hugely from his interest. Moreover, Elon's funds and resources could be just what Intel needs to right the ship -- though many of us already believe ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger's efforts had already put the company on the right track.Whether this rumor is true remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: investors have reacted positively to it, leading to a nearly 10% increase in Intel's share price in off hours trading.",

This has come on the heels of a rough stretch for Intel, which is down more than 50% over the past twelve months.\n\nConcerned about the company\u2019s direction, Intel\u2019s Board of Directors took the weighty step of firing CEO Pat Gelsinger in December. The company\u2019s shares haven\u2019t exactly jumped up on the news, however, as the market clearly remains worried that the company has not quite figured out how to right the ship.\n\nHowever, the low expectations could actually serve the company, believes one top investor known by the pseudonym Quad 7 Capital. Even before the news broke of the potential acquisition, Quad 7 had already posited that Intel was on the road to recovery.\n\n\u201cDespite current challenges, INTC\u2019s low stock price offers a compelling long-term entry point, with substantial growth expected in 2025 and beyond,\u201d explains the 5-star investor, who sits in the top 3% of TipRanks\u2019 stock pros.\n\nQuad 7 explains that there are a number of reasons for optimism, including strategic investments in data centers and AI. The investor expects both of these segments to enjoy quarter-over-quarter increases in the \u201chigh single-digits\u201d when Intel reports its Q4 numbers at the end of the month.\n\nThat should be part of of an overall trend of improvement for the embattled company, predicts Quad 7, with the turnaround beginning in earnest after Q1 2025.\n\n\u201cWe expect substantial improvement as 2025 moves on, including year-over-year revenue growth, cash flow growth, and earnings growth,\u201d asserts the investor.\n\nRegarding the low expectations from the market, this is in fact an advantage for Intel. Calling the company\u2019s revenue guide both low and realistic, Quad 7 is looking for Intel to surpass expectations in the year to come.\n\n\u201cThe future is bright,\u201d concludes Quad 7 Capital, who is rating the company a Buy. (To watch Quad 7 Capital\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nWall Street, on the other hand, remains on the fence regarding Intel\u2019s prospects. With 1 Buy, 21 Hold, and 4 Sell ratings, Intel holds a consensus Hold (i.e. Neutral) rating. Its 12-month average price target of $24.42 would yield gains in the mid-teens.

            "content": "It\u2019s the rumour of the weekend. After Elon Musk about to buy TikTok, now Elon Musk wants to buy Intel. Whether this is just a publicity stunt or a real ambition, we take a closer look at a rumour that has been causing quite a stir in recent hours.\n\nWith the inauguration of Donald Trump, key words associated with Elon Musk (including SpaceX, which we\u2019ll talk about later) and a bit of tech, we\u2019ve got the right cocktail to create a buzz in the last few hours. But this rumour didn\u2019t come out of the blue, as it was distilled by SemiAccurate, a respected source in the semiconductor industry.\n\nIs Intel, not at the top of its game, really a prey?\n\nSince the \u2018departure\u2019 of its CEO, Intel seems to be in a holding pattern (an interim management team is running the day-to-day operations) while others are moving forward. A situation that adds to the uncertainty and pressure from financial circles. However, even in its short form, Intel is not an empty shell. The company remains a major player, with colossal revenues, an enormous capacity for innovation and, above all, a well-oiled industrial plant. While some believe that a takeover of Intel by Musk would be far-fetched, others consider the hypothesis credible. The new US administration is planning to take back the leadership in wafer-thinness and high-volume chip production capacity from Asian players. This is a key strategy for the Trump administration at a time when geopolitical uncertainties pose a huge threat to other local champions AMD and Nvidia. Indeed, dependence on Taiwan\u2019s TSMC could cause these two companies to collapse like a house of cards in the event of a major crisis between China and Taiwan.\n\nDoes Intel make sense for Musk?\n\nThe first thing that strikes you about the SpaceX boss\u2019s track record is that Intel is a heavyweight structure, with multiple processes and a need to hire and retain brains. So far we\u2019ve seen that he prefers start-ups or flexible companies. A world where he can shake things up and reinvent an entire model by slimming down the workforce. However, his main companies, Tesla and SpaceX, are hardware-intensive and increasingly in need of computing power and chips to manage their own AI, in their vehicles, for the design of their rockets, robots, etc. Controlling a foundry and designer could provide Musk and America in general with a perfectly independent and autonomous centre. Musk\u2019s theoretical ambitions aside, this could also be a major sovereign act on the part of the new US administration.\n\nWhile SemiAccurate confirms that Elon Musk and his teams at SpaceX are working on a potential acquisition of Intel, this does not mean that the deal is on track. The challenge seems significant, but not all that crazy in the context of the global re-industrialisation that the Americans have embarked upon. The new Trump administration should shed some light on the subject. One thing is certain: with Musk, what seems improbable or even illogical is not necessarily so in his head.",

The Dow climbed by 0.78 percent, the S&P rose by 1 percent, and the Nasdaq soared by 1.51 percent, driven by bullish sentiments surrounding the market and upcoming political shifts.\n\nAmong the standout performers were ten companies, particularly those involved in Bitcoin mining, which thrived as optimism in the cryptocurrency arena surged. This enthusiasm can be linked to promises of support from President-elect Donald Trump, signaling a favorable outlook for digital currencies.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) made headlines by climbing 9.25 percent to close at $21.49 per share, fueled by rumors of a potential acquisition by a significant unnamed entity. Once a titan in semiconductor manufacturing, Intel has faced challenges in maintaining its leading position amid rapid industry changes.\n\nThe company\u2019s recent leadership shake-up, including the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger, indicates internal struggles. Past discussions with Qualcomm and interest from Arm Holdings never materialized into concrete deals, raising questions about Intel\u2019s future direction.\n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at revitalizing U.S. semiconductor production, places Intel at a critical juncture as it seeks to bolster American chip manufacturing. While Intel\u2019s prospects as an investment are noted, many experts argue that other sectors, particularly AI, may offer even more lucrative opportunities in the near term.\n\nMarket Momentum and Its Broader Implications\n\nThe recent bullish performance on Wall Street underscores a pivotal moment in the economic landscape, reflecting broader trends that resonate beyond mere statistics. As indices surged, fueled by optimism surrounding political shifts and the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector, it exemplifies a critical intersection of finance, technology, and governance.\n\nThe influence of digital currencies is particularly noteworthy, with Bitcoin mining companies emerging as significant market players. As cryptocurrencies gain acceptance, we may witness a fundamental shift in financial systems worldwide, challenging traditional banking models. This growing acceptance could also stimulate innovation, accelerating developments in blockchain technology that promise to reshape various sectors, from supply chain to healthcare.\n\nFrom an environmental perspective, the surge in interest in Bitcoin mining raises pressing concerns. The energy-intensive nature of mining operations has sparked debate over their sustainability. As climate change increasingly dominates discourse, the effectiveness of digital currencies may hinge on the industry\u2019s ability to shift toward greener energy sources.\n\nLooking forward, the tumult in semiconductor giants like Intel highlights the vulnerability of established players in an era characterized by rapid technological advancement. As AI continues to revolutionize industries, companies entrenched in traditional manufacturing may need to pivot swiftly to stay relevant. The dual trajectories of tech and finance present a mixed bag of challenges and opportunities in a world where digital transformation is not just an option but a necessity.\n\nMarket Surge: Is It Time to Invest? Insights on Recent Wall Street Gains\n\nOverview of Recent Market Performance\n\nRecently, Wall Street experienced a vibrant trading day, with all major indices showing substantial gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 0.78 percent, the S&P 500 rose by 1 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite soared by 1.51 percent. This positive momentum is attributed to a mixture of bullish market sentiment and anticipated political changes that investors believe could provide favorable economic conditions.\n\nImpact of Cryptocurrency on Market Sentiments\n\nA significant driver of market enthusiasm was the performance of Bitcoin mining companies, which thrived amidst rising optimism in the cryptocurrency space. This upward trend is closely tied to expectations of support from political leaders, particularly President-elect Donald Trump, whose stance could enhance the regulatory and economic landscape for digital currencies. As cryptocurrency continues to attract investor interest, monitoring how this sector will influence overall market performance will be essential.\n\nIntel Corporation: A Company in Transition\n\nOne of the key players in the market that caught attention was Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), which saw its share price climb 9.25 percent, closing at $21.49 per share. This surge was largely fueled by rumors of a potential acquisition by an unnamed major entity, sparking discussions about Intel\u2019s future in the semiconductor industry.\n\nHistorically a leader in semiconductor manufacturing, Intel has faced numerous challenges, including leadership changes and competition from emerging technology firms. Recent developments, such as the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger, have raised questions about the company\u2019s strategic direction. Past merger discussions with Qualcomm and interest from Arm Holdings did not materialize, highlighting Intel\u2019s struggles in solidifying its position in a rapidly evolving market.\n\nCHIPS and Science Act: Path to Revitalization\n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act, designed to bolster American semiconductor manufacturing, places Intel at a pivotal point as it seeks to reclaim its leadership role in the industry. While the company\u2019s prospects are still regarded favorably by some investors, many experts caution that sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) could present more lucrative investment opportunities in the near term.\n\nInvestment Insights and Market Predictions\n\nAs investors look ahead, there are several factors to consider:\n\n\u2013 Use Cases: Companies involved in cryptocurrency and AI are becoming increasingly relevant as digital transformation accelerates.\n\n\u2013 Trends: The ongoing transition towards renewable energy solutions and sustainable manufacturing practices is shaping market dynamics.\n\n\u2013 Limitations: Intel\u2019s market gains may be volatile and dependent on external acquisition narratives, while the semiconductor sector remains highly competitive.\n\nPros and Cons of Investing in Intel\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Potential for growth if the acquisition proceeds or if new leadership can steer the company effectively.\n\n\u2013 Strong position in a critical industry bolstered by governmental support initiatives through the CHIPS Act.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Recent leadership instability and lack of successful mergers raises concerns.\n\n\u2013 Competitive pressures from companies focusing on AI and advanced computing could overshadow Intel\u2019s traditional offerings.\n\nFor those considering investments, carefully weighing these factors and diversifying within tech stocks can be prudent.

            "content": "President-elect Donald Trump plans to suspend the security clearances of dozens of former intelligence community officials who wrote an infamous letter about Hunter Biden ahead of the 2020 election, according to a report about Trump\u2019s anticipated Day One executive actions.\n\nA Trump administration official told Fox News that Trump\u2019s expected action would be directed at the 51 ex-officials who \u201clied\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop in the letter, which was published two weeks before the election.\n\nAmong the letter\u2019s signatories were three former CIA directors, including John Brennan, as well as former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. It is unclear whether all 51 signatories still possess security clearances. Trump said in 2018 that he used his presidential authority to revoke Brennan\u2019s, but Brennan later said he was uncertain about whether the revocation ever actually took place. The Washington Examiner reached out to the CIA for comment.\n\nThe letter became a flashpoint in the 2020 election. The 51 officials alleged in it that a damning story in the New York Post published in October of that year about the Bidens might have been Russian disinformation, thereby casting doubt on the story.\n\n\u201cThe arrival on the US political scene of emails purportedly belonging to Vice President Biden\u2019s son Hunter, much of it related to his time serving on the Board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation,\u201d the officials wrote.\n\nThe New York Post had reported that Joe Biden allegedly used his vice presidential power to strong-arm Ukraine for Hunter Biden\u2019s personal benefit. The outlet based its story on emails buried in a copy of Hunter Biden\u2019s hard drive, which it received from former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. The New York Post said a Delaware computer repair shop owner had given Giuliani\u2019s representative the hard drive copy.\n\nHunter Biden had abandoned his laptop and hard drive at the Delaware shop in 2019. Court records revealed that the shop owner handed over the laptop and original hard drive to the FBI later that year in response to a subpoena. An FBI official confirmed during Hunter Biden\u2019s trial in Delaware last year that the laptop and hard drive were authentic, though the official did not verify the authenticity of all of the data on the hard drive copies that Giuliani and other Republican operatives disseminated to the New York Post and other media.\n\nThe letter, coming from officials who once worked in some of the highest national security and intelligence roles in the government, carried significant weight and resulted in then-candidate Joe Biden relying on it to dismiss the New York Post\u2019s story during the final presidential debate.\n\nHouse Republicans also uncovered that one of the letter\u2019s authors, former acting CIA Director Mike Morell, had explicitly initiated the letter in part because he wanted to give Joe Biden a \u201ctalking point\u201d for the debate. Morell emphasized to Congress that he also was sincerely concerned about Russia meddling in the election.\n\nStill, Morell and the other signatories have continued to face criticism from Trump supporters for producing such an influential document at the height of a competitive presidential election, when it was bound to affect the race.\n\nAttorney Mark Zaid, who represents eight of the 51 signatories, told the Washington Examiner that Trump\u2019s executive action to suspend their security clearances would defy decades of precedent.\n\n\u201cIt would be contrary to decades of national security norms to suspend the security clearances of individuals who did nothing other than, as private citizens, exercise their protected First Amendment rights,\u201d Zaid said. \u201cSuch an action would be unprecedented and undeserved, especially given many of the signatories spent their entire careers serving apolitically to protect the American people.\u201d\n\nINAUGURATION DAY 2025: EVERYTHING TO KNOW AHEAD OF TRUMP TAKING OFFICE\n\nZaid also said the move would fly in the face of Trump\u2019s calls to protect free speech, particularly on the social media apps TikTok and X.\n\n\u201cIt is also quite ironic that at the same time this Executive Order is issued, the White House claims it supports the restoration of freedom of speech and seeks to end federal censorship,\u201d Zaid said.",

            "content": "Our testing shows that Intel\u2019s fix for its Arrow Lake chips isn\u2019t effective in addressing the chips\u2019 lackluster gaming performance, at least on the motherboards we tested with. And we found that the Core Ultra 9 285K\u2019s updated gaming performance with one motherboard is now slightly slower than before. Additionally, the required operating system update has improved gaming performance for the prior-gen Raptor Lake Refresh even more than the Arrow Lake chips, so the flagship Core Ultra 9 285K falls even further behind its predecessor. As you'll see in our benchmarks below, the Core Ultra 9 285K still does not meet Intel\u2019s initial gaming performance marketing claims and will not make our list of the best CPUs for gaming.\n\nThe Intel \u2018Arrow Lake\u2019 Core Ultra 200S launch was marred with lower gaming performance than the company promised, failing to match the prior-gen Core i9-14900K flagship in gaming despite the company\u2019s already-uninspiring claims of parity. Intel pointed to numerous issues as the source of the low gaming performance and issued fixes via both Windows and BIOS patches.\n\nAt CES 2025, Intel issued its own benchmarks with claims of up to 25% more gaming performance with the 'fix,' a claim we\u2019ve unfortunately seen parroted by the press. But those gains only apply to certain very specific issues that not all reviewers and users will have encountered. As we'll cover in-depth below, there\u2019s a copious amount of wiggle room in Intel\u2019s dubious claims of performance gains, but our tests show the patches don\u2019t have a tangible impact on the competitive positioning against AMD, and even worse, Arrow Lake now fares worse in gaming against its predecessor.\n\nTesting Details\n\nIntel\u2019s \u2018fix\u2019 requires two basic components: Windows 11 build 26100.2314 (or newer) and microcode version 0x114 with CSME firmware kit 19.0.0.1854v2.2 (or newer). For our original review, we tested the then-current Windows version 26100.2033. We moved to version 26100.2605 for the configurations that represent patched performance. Intel says the newer version has an improved Power Performance Management (PPM) package that ensures good performance when using the balanced power profile. However, as with all reviewers who follow the most basic of best practices, we originally tested with the High Performance power profile for Intel systems, so we expect minimal to no impact on our testing from this change. You can read about the rest of the fixes here.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 had a rather large performance increase from a fix issued for the game code. However, Intel says this was an issue of the game dev\u2019s own making, and the dev fixed the issue itself. Intel says we shouldn\u2019t expect further game code updates that will boost Arrow Lake's performance in the future.\n\nMultiple game titles have also received updates since our original review, thus making it impossible to replicate those results with the newer test configs. To keep things apples-to-apples, we took our original test setup with the launch version of the BIOS and Windows for a spin back through our test suite to ensure that we don\u2019t attribute performance gains from game code updates to a \u2018fix\u2019 from Intel. Then, we tested the impact after updating to the latest BIOS/Windows versions.\n\nAs such, the entries below marked with 'Original' represent the original launch BIOS and firmware, but have new updated testing to reflect the current state of the game code. The entries marked with 'New FW-OS' represent testing with the cumulative impacts of all updates. For the sake of expediency, we only tested with standard DDR5 memory (no CUDIMMS) and two motherboard platforms.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

I retested this condition multiple times, and Asus has yet to respond to our queries on the matter.\n\nWe shifted gears to testing on the MSI motherboard to see if we could expect performance regressions with all motherboards. The MSI motherboard started from a much lower bar with the original firmware/OS, but it did make at least a decent 3.7% step forward. However, it still trails the original unpatched Asus configuration with the same setup we used for our review by 1.9%.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, compared to the fastest patched 285K results on the MSI motherboard, the Ryzen 9 9950X is now 6.5% faster (it was ~3% faster in our original review), and the Ryzen 7 9800X3D remains nearly 40% faster than the 285K \u2013 it isn\u2019t close. That means the fix has not altered Arrow Lake\u2019s competitive positioning in a positive way versus AMD\u2019s processors.\n\nMore concerning for Intel is that its previous-gen Core i9-14900K experienced much stronger uplift than the Core 9 285K from updating to the new version of Windows. We only updated the OS for the updated 14900K config \u2013 no new firmware had been released for our test motherboard since the 285K review. As you can see, the 14900K is now 7% faster than the testing with the older version of Windows. It appears that Windows has corrected some sort of issue with all Intel processors here, leading to the 14900K now being 14% faster than the 285K.\n\nFor reference, we originally measured the 14900K at 6.4% faster than the 285K in our launch day review, but now the 14900K is 14% faster than the updated 285K. Again, this trails Intel\u2019s original performance claims of the 285K having parity with the 14900K.\n\nSo far in our game performance testing and the testing we\u2019ve seen from other media outlets, while Intel has perhaps fixed a few corner cases, it surely has not fixed the mess created when it set expectations for the Core Ultra 9 285K unrealistically high. The 285K still does not live up to those expectations, and the fact of the matter is that the previous-gen Intel chips are demonstrably faster in gaming.\n\nCore Ultra 9 285K productivity performance\n\nImage 1 of 18 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Arrow Lake is all bad, of course. The 285K has its charms in generational gains to single- and multi-threaded workloads, though AMD still holds the title in the latter category.\n\nHere, we can see that the Core Ultra 'fixes\u2019 had no impact on overall performance in either our cumulative measurements of performance in single- or multi-threaded productivity workloads. We did see a slight regression for the 14900K with the updated OS, but only by a scant 0.8%, which falls within the expected variance.\n\nConclusion\n\nImage 1 of 16 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nHere are Intel\u2019s performance claims from a presentation during CES 2025 that outlines the impact of its patch. Several of these issues will not have impacted skilled reviewers, such as using a balanced power profile or not verifying that APO was working (APO impacts a limited number of games that most good reviewers test anyway). On the matter of APO, this was available to reviewers for launch-day reviews - we used it - and merely required one to simply verify it was working. One of the other examples shows an improvement in 7zip, but that has nothing to do with the shortcomings in gaming.\n\nYou'll also notice that Intel includes improved performance in Cyberpunk 2077 in the summary slide. However, the company has also said the issue with that title was self-inflicted by the devs and fixed without Intel's prodding. Yet it's chalked up as an Intel win from the 'fix.' Intel also doesn't mention that the 14900K also saw a solid boost from the updated Cyberpunk 2077 game code. The same can also be said about Far Cry 6 - the 14900K benefitted far more than the 285K from the move forward to the new version of Windows.\n\nIntel\u2019s presentation clearly shows the performance impact of the various features being turned on or off, but this is misleading, and Intel\u2019s statements are vague and nebulous. You may or may not suffer from any or some of these issues, and the impact of each issue could vary greatly depending on your setup. All of the claims in the charts above, or none of the claims, or anything in between, could or could not apply to you and your system. Intel also says all of these issues could impact you in one moment in time but not in another, despite nothing (like settings) having been changed. Here\u2019s how Intel puts it:\n\n\u201cThe exact performance uplift you will experience with these updates depends on the specific issue, or combination of issues, present on your system when your data was originally collected. Results also depend on your selection of games or applications. Some issues are more elusive than others, more relevant to certain workload characteristics, and/or intermittent in nature.\u201d\n\nThat makes pushing back definitively on the claims nearly impossible. Regardless, Intel\u2019s claims of the performance being faster or slower with items toggled on or off still doesn\u2019t clarify the correct issue \u2013 the 285K's competitive positioning. You\u2019ll notice that none of Intel's tests above include competing processors, be they a previous-gen Intel part or any AMD part. That's why you don't see important things like the 14900K's increased performance in Cyberpunk 2077 and Far Cry 6.\n\nThese tactics and the test results make this whole 'fix' exercise feel more like misdirection and spin than an actual fix. Yes, Intel admits that it failed to make sure that some issues were addressed in a way that would apply evenly across all users, and it has now corrected those issues. However, it still hasn\u2019t brought the chips up to the level of performance it originally promised, and even if it merely matched its previous-gen chips in gaming as it claimed, that's still not great. We expect generational improvements in performance, and anything less is rightly frowned upon.\n\nAt the end of the day, Intel\u2019s fixes for its various failings did not demonstrably \u2018fix\u2019 the Core Ultra 9 285K\u2019s gaming performance in any meaningful way, and they certainly aren't enough to meet the company\u2019s original marketing claims or change the competitive positioning of its lackluster Arrow Lake chips. In fact, it looks like Arrow Lake is moving backward. Despite its other positive attributes, the Core Ultra 285K simply isn\u2019t the best option for gaming.",

Just recently, we reported on how SemiAccurate, a renowned research firm, claimed that there's a 90% chance of an Intel buyout, and the \"paywalled\" report mentioned the name of Elon Musk involved in the negotiations, further fueling the rumors to new heights. In addition, Dylan Patel, a famous analyst, has put up an interesting message at X, yet again revealing Elon's presence in the negotiations, which we'll discuss next.\n\nElon's jet is in Florida.\n\nGlobal Foundries jet is in Florida.\n\nQualcomm's jet is in Florida.\n\nIn case anyone was wondering what's going on with Intel...\n\nThey are at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMake America Great Again can only be true if Intel is saved. \u2014 Dylan Patel (@dylan522p) January 17, 2025\n\nIf you look at the Intel buyout saga, we see potential customers like Qualcomm, ARM, and even AMD pop up, but the newest rumor looks to be more solid than ever, as with the Trump administration coming in, there's more hope for Intel. Dylan from SemiAnalysis claims that there are some kinds of talks going around that involve Elon Musk, the semiconductor firm Global Foundries, and the chipmaker Qualcomm, saying that all of these parties are at Mar-a-Lago potentially discussing Intel's takeover along with several other aspects.\n\nInterestingly, Citibank's analyst Christopher Danely has discussed the \"Intel-Elon\" rumor as well, and here's what he had to say:\n\nWe view this as a poor outcome for Intel unless it was able to hire a CEO who would exit the merchant foundry business. - via SeekingAlpha\n\nElon getting involved in the party is undoubtedly huge for Intel as a business, given how big of an influence he would have on the takeover. While there's uncertainty around how big of a role Elon will play in this deal, it's likely that he might put his financial resources to good use, transforming Intel into something completely different and maybe revolutionary. While this rumor should be taken with a grain of salt for now, it shouldn't be ruled out entirely, given that Musk tends to surprise us several times.\n\nInvestors have already reacted positively to the development, with Intel's shares rising by up to nearly 10 percent. It's safe to say that with the Trump administration coming in, Intel and several other US-focused companies will have a great time.",

            "content": "In context: Intel Core Ultra 200 desktop processors failed to impress some reviewers (including us) when they launched last October as the company's new flagship Arrow Lake-S lineup. While they performed adequately in compute tests, gaming was a mixed bag, with the chips being outperformed in multiple titles by the previous Raptor Lake generation.\n\nFixes do nothing \u2013 Update (Jan 18): We have yet to test Intel's claimed fixes for its Arrow Lake chips, however Tom's Hardware was quick to run a few gaming benchmarks on the flagship Core Ultra 9 285K. In short, the updates fail to address the underwhelming gaming performance for such a high-end chip.\n\nIn some cases, performance even decreased after the updates, while previous-gen Raptor Lake Refresh chips benefited more from the required OS update, further widening the gap. Ultimately, we can't justify how Intel is trying to spin this story beyond what can be proven and making false promises does more harm than good.\n\nIntel quickly investigated the situation, and by December, it had a good idea of what was causing the performance hiccups. It turned out to be a combination of power plan problems, anti-cheat settings, and other random issues \u2013 though the biggest was a missing Performance & Power Management (PPM) package.\n\nThe first series of fixes landed before the holidays in a mandatory Windows 11 update alongside some publisher patches. But Intel said we'd have to wait until CES in January for the second wave \u2013 a crucial BIOS update to really unlock the Ultra 200's untapped potential. Well, that update just dropped, and according to Intel's internal tests, it's put the performance woes to bed in a big way.\n\nThere are some sizable gaming gains in Intel's numbers. For instance, in Cyberpunk: 2077, Intel claims the fixes could net a staggering 26% increase in frames per second on patched Ultra 200 systems, as reported by PC World. Meanwhile, Far Cry 6 could see up to 16% more FPS.\n\nHowever, the performance hikes don't stop at games. Intel also ran the popular 3DMark TimeSpy synthetic benchmark and said patched Ultra 200 systems could see their overall scores skyrocket by up to 97%.\n\nWe'll have to run some tests ourselves before we can corroborate Intel's lofty numbers. But all the software and BIOS fixes are available now, so if you've got an underperforming Arrow Lake build, it's time to load up those updates. Just make sure you're running the latest Windows version and check in with your system or motherboard manufacturer for that all-important BIOS update.\n\nNow that the desktop Ultra 200 has (hopefully) been dealt with, Intel can turn its attention to ensuring a smooth, high-performance release for its new Core H and HX laptop CPUs aimed at gamers and creators. Those chips are expected to start shipping soon, so we hope Intel can ensure a smooth release this time.\n\nMasthead credit: Madness727",

The rumors have been circulating for about two months, originating from a reliable source. The acquisition plan's credibility is estimated to be 90%, although no official statement has been made by the interested party.\n\nThe acquisition rumors are being kept under wraps, likely to prevent a spike in Intel's stock price. Business Insider suggests that Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, could be the potential buyer. Citigroup analysts have expressed concerns, stating that unless Intel hires a CEO capable of exiting the foundry business with advanced manufacturing experience, the acquisition might not be favorable for Intel.\n\nIntel, once a dominant chip manufacturer, has struggled to keep pace with the rapidly evolving industry. In December 2024, CEO Pat Gelsinger will step down due to the board's lack of confidence in his turnaround plans. Intel reported a historic loss of $16.639 billion from July to September 2024, marking three consecutive quarters of losses due to overinvestment in semiconductor equipment and layoff-related expenses.\n\nBefore Gelsinger's departure, potential buyers had already shown interest in Intel. Qualcomm, SoftBank's Arm, and Broadcom have all considered acquisitions but did not proceed. As of January 17, Intel's market value stands at $92.7 billion, while competitors AMD and Nvidia have market values of $197.1 billion and $3.4 trillion, respectively.",

Traditionally, access to high-performance network programming tools has been limited by closed-source software, high costs, or proprietary restrictions. Open-sourcing Tofino P4 removes these barriers, allowing anyone with the curiosity and skills to participate. This democratization is a game-changer for startups, academic institutions, and developers in underrepresented regions. Aspiring P4 developers can now explore, dissect, and learn from production-grade software.\"\n\nAn interesting open-source announcement out of Intel this week is that they have open-sourced their P4 software for their line of Tofino programmable Ethernet switches.The Intel Tofino P4 software has been open-sourced to help open up new possibilities around programmable networks. Intel's announcement on the P4 programming language project site around this open-source move mentions:Intel's open-sourcing announcement can be read in full at P4.org\n\nThe only sad part about this announcement is that the Tofino product line is effectively dead. The Intel Tofino P4-programmable Ethernet switch ASICs initially launched back in 2016. The Tofino 2 launched in 2018 allows up to a 32x400G port P4 programmable Ethernet switch with a maximum bandwidth of 12.8 Tbps. But in 2023 Intel ceased further development of the Tofino ASICs. It's therefore a bit surprising/odd that now in 2025 they are finally open-sourcing their P4 software. In any event we welcome all of their open-source software announcements.",

I think that's an open question for another day,\u201d he said.\n\nThe other interim co-CEO, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, noted in the same December forum that the company already runs Intel Foundry and Intel Products \u201cfairly independently,\u201d with the latter set to become an independent subsidiary.\n\nWhile Holthaus said a future leader could decide to completely separate the two businesses, she saw the ownership of both as a competitive differentiator.\n\n\u201cProduct makes their decisions, foundry makes their decisions, but for both of those businesses, I think, long term, to be very differentiated in the market\u2014great products with a great process technology that we have first access to\u2014is a differentiator,\u201d she said.\n\nDaniel Newman, chief analyst and CEO at The Futurum Group, said in an X post Friday that he was skeptical about the potential for a company to acquire Intel whole, especially given that the \u201cregulatory scrutiny of a deal like this leaves so few realistic suitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stand by my assessment that a true split is the most likely outcome. Independent of the Foundry business Intel Products can be a very profitable business.

Although SLB struck a cautious tone for 2025, indicating that year-over-year revenue growth would be limited as high oil supply levels restrain oilfield activities, its shares jumped 6.1% in the wake of the strong earnings report.\n\nShares of Truist Financial (TFC) gained 5.9% after the bank holding company topped quarterly sales and profit estimates. Net interest income and non-interest income moved higher from their year-ago levels, helping drive the strong results. An increase in average deposit balances also contributed to Truist's performance, which came despite a downturn in average loan balances.\n\nShares of J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) suffered the steepest drop of any S&P 500 stock on Friday, tumbling 7.4% after the shipping firm's fourth-quarter sales and profits fell short of expectations. Slumping volumes weighed on performance, and the company reported revenue declines across all of its segments. J.B. Hunt's CEO said that the company remains focused on repairing its margins as it navigates freight-industry headwinds.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) shares fell 4.2%, extending losses posted earlier this week after the pharmaceutical giant cut its sales guidance. Friday's move lower came as Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that it had selected the popular weight-loss and diabetes treatments made by Novo Nordisk (NVO) for potential price negotiations, raising concerns that similar products from Lilly could also come under Medicare scrutiny. Novo Nordisk's U.S.-listed American Depository Receipts sank 5.3%.\n\nShares of Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO), the analytics software firm known for its FICO credit scores, sank 3.5%, giving back gains posted earlier in the week after Jefferies boosted its price target on the stock. Analysts pointed increased expectations for the company's business-to-business volumes, but slower mortgage originations in the high interest rate environment remain a concern.",

The buzz started after SemiAccurate leaked an email claiming that a well-funded suitor is interested in acquiring Intel outright. While there's still a lot of fog surrounding the details, investors are reacting positively after Intel's in the past twelve months, which saw its stock plunge 55%. This news comes on the heels of leadership changes, with former CEO Pat Gelsinger being pushed out just last month.\n\nThis isn't the first time Intel's future has been in play. Back in September, Qualcomm (QCOM) reportedly explored buying Intel, but the deal fell apart due to complexities. Qualcomm could circle back, thoughit's still eyeing Intel's design business or even a more strategic stake in the company. Whoever the mystery buyer is, SemiAccurate hints they've got the financial muscle to make a deal happen.\n\nThe big question now: Is this serious, or just more corporate chatter? If the deal rumors turn out to be true, we could see massive ripples in the semiconductor sector. Intel's on the ropes, and it's unclear who's lining up to take the knockout swing.

The company missed profit expectations partly due to Intel\u2019s decision to \u201cmore quickly ramp\u201d its Core Ultra artificial intelligence CPUs, or core processing units, that can handle AI applications, Gelsinger said on the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September, a report said chipmaker Qualcomm was interested in buying some of Intel\u2019s chip design units. Intel has also worked with its longtime investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS+2.51% ) and Goldman Sachs (GS+2.25% ) on options to save its business, including by splitting its foundry division, which designs and manufactures chips, cutting factory projects, and M&A, according to Bloomberg. The company was reportedly also in talks with alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO+1.88% ) for a $5 billion investment.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel was awarded up to $7.87 billion in direct funding in November under the Chips Act. The funding will directly support Intel\u2019s nearly $90 billion planned investment in the U.S. by the end of the decade \u2014 part a more than $100 billion expansion plan for fabrication and advanced packaging facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon.",

It's hard to tell if this is because demand has been good or supply was low (Intel says it has been restocking \"weekly,\" for what that's worth). But regardless, there's clearly been some pent-up demand for an inexpensive-but-competent entry-level graphics card with decent ray-tracing performance and power efficiency and more than 8GB of RAM.\n\nThe Arc B570 is a less-powerful, less-interesting card than the B580, with fewer of Intel's Xe-cores, less memory bandwidth, and 10GB of RAM instead of 12GB. But it offers performance very similar to the RTX 4060 for $80 less\u2014at least, if Intel and its partners can keep it in stock at that price\u2014which makes it a dramatically more interesting budget option than $200-ish cards like the GeForce RTX 3050 or Radeon RX 6600.\n\nAn Arc B580, but less\n\nEverything about the B570 is scaled down just a bit compared to the B580. Credit: Intel\n\nThe B570 uses the exact same GPU silicon as the B580 but with a slightly lower clock speed and a couple of Xe cores disabled. Memory bus width has also been nudged downward, from 192-bits to 160-bits. The downgrades also give it a lower total board power of 150 W\u2014quite a bit less than the 190 W of the B580, but still enough to require a single 8-pin power connector from your power supply rather than being able to get all of its power from your PCI Express slot.\n\nThe card's 10GB of RAM just barely allows Intel to claim that the B570 is more future-proof than cards like the RTX 4060, which still ship with 8GB of RAM. Though 8GB won't limit your performance much at the resolutions that the B570 is powerful enough to render, a little more memory can help in a handful of edge cases, even if it's only 2GB.",

So it\u2019s unsurprising that PC makers who were already offering systems with Intel Alder Lake-N chips are now offering Twin Lake versions of those same systems.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a number of Alder Lake-N mini PCs updated with Twin lake chips. Now Topton has updated a mini ITX board for NAS systems by adding Intel N150 and Core 3 N355 Twin Lake processor options. The board is available from AliExpress for $169 and up.\n\nThis board has actually been around since late 2023, but it\u2019s now available with several more processor options. What makes the 170 x 170mm (6.7\u2033 x 6.7\u2033) motherboard interesting is that it\u2019s clearly made for networking and storage applications: you can set it up as a NAS, router, firewall, or general purpose server.\n\nIn addition to a choice of four different inexpensive, energy-efficient processor options, the board features:\n\nAmong other things, it features:\n\n6 x SATA 3.0 connectors for hard drives or SSDs\n\n2 x M.2 2280 slots with support for PCIe 3.0 x1 storage\n\n1 x PCIe x1 connector\n\n1 x SODIMM slot with support for up to 32GB of DDR5-5200 or DDR5-5600 memory\n\n4 x 2.5 Gb Ethernet ports (Intel i226-V)\n\n1 x HDMI 2.1 port\n\n1 x DisplayPort 1.4b\n\n1 x USB 3.0 Type-A\n\n2 x USB 2.0 Type-A\n\n1 x USB 2.0 Type-A\n\n1 x 3.5mm audio\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that Alder Lake N and Twin Lake processors only have 9 PCIe lanes, and this board has a lot of functions, which is why the M.2 2280 slots are each limited to single-lane PCIe 3.0 speeds. The board also has a PCIe slot that shares a lane with the second M.2 slot, which means you can use one or the other, but cannot use both at the same time.\n\nThe $169 starting price is for a motherboard with a 6-watt Intel N100 quad-core processor based on Alder Lake-N architecture, but you can pay $10 more for a model with a version with an Intel N150 Twin Lake chip that supports CPU and graphics speeds up to 200 MHz and 250 MHz faster, respectively.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a little more performance, there are also models with Intel Core i3-N305 and Core 3 N355 chips. These are both 15-watt octa-core processors wither higher-performance graphics than you get with the N100/N150. Prices start at $279 for a model with a Core i3-N305 chip or $289 for a Core 3 N355 model (which supports CPU and GPU speeds that are only up to 100 MHz higher).\n\nSupport Liliputing Liliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links (if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on Amazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).

The \u00a3200 / $200~ market is in desperate need of a fresh face, now long-forgotten by both AMD and Nvidia, making this pixel pusher a potentially attractive purchase for many.

Its BMG-G21 GPU isn\u2019t that much weaker than Arc B580, and its 10GB VRAM buffer and memory bandwidth runs circles around the competition. While the card does manage this on occasion, there are other forces at work against it that diminish its value both at present and for the future.\n\nSpecifications\n\nThere\u2019s no direct predecessor that Arc B570 succeeds, naturally placing a greater spotlight on comparisons to Arc B580. Intel uses the same BMG-G21 GPU across both cards but cuts back some specifications on the former. The company additionally reduces clock speeds and memory capacity, alongside narrowing the interface. In theory, these are all reasonable cuts in service of a lower price point, netting lower power consumption as an added bonus.\n\nASRock Challenger OC Arc B570 Intel Arc B580 Limited Edition Released Jan 2025 Dec 2024 Codename Battlemage Battlemage Process TSMC N5 TSMC N5 GPU BMG-G21 BMG-G21 Transistors 19.6 billion 19.6 billion Die size 272mm\u00b2 272mm\u00b2 Xe cores 18 of 20 20 of 20 Render slices 5 5 Ray tracing units 18 20 XMX AI engines 144 160 Base clock 2,600MHz 2,670MHz Boost clock 2,850MHz 2,850MHz Memory 10GB (GDDR6) 12GB (GDDR6) Mem. interface 160-bit 192-bit Mem. bandwidth 380GB/s 456GB/s Peak TOPs 203 233 TBP 150W 190W Launch MSRP \u00a3250 / $230 \u00a3249 / $249\n\nDiving into the specifics of the specifications, Arc B570 retains the same five render slices as its beefier sibling but features two (10%) fewer Xe cores for a total of 18. This translates to mirrored reductions elsewhere, including ray tracing units (18) and XMX AI Engines (144). Meanwhile, graphics clock speed comes in at 2,500MHz, a touch below the 2,670MHz clock of Arc B580. Smaller specs beget slimmer power draw, with Intel budgeting 150W for its new card by default.\n\nThe changes that more definitively separate Arc B570 from its bigger brother, however, stem from the makeup of its memory. The card boasts 10GB of GDDR6 running at 19Gb/s and riding on a 160-bit interface, for a total of 380GB/s of bandwidth. While this falls considerably short of its sibling\u2019s capabilities, the pixel pusher is still a cut above the relatively thin configurations of Radeon RX 7600 and GeForce RTX 4060.\n\nImage: Club386.\n\nThere\u2019s no \u2018Limited Edition\u2019 coming from Intel for Arc B570, meaning it\u2019s up to board partners to deliver reference specifications. This isn\u2019t the case with ASRock Challenger OC which offers clock speed boosts of 100MHz out of the box for \u00a3250 / $230, a 5-13% bump in price relative to MSRP (\u00a3219 / $219). There\u2019s no danger of the card treading on its sibling\u2019s toes, though. Arc B580 Limited Edition stock is all but evaporated, placing pronounced pressure on ASRock to deliver value relative to similarly priced alternatives.\n\nDesign\n\nASRock has recently refreshed the look of its Challenger Series graphics cards, first debuting with Arc B580 and seen here again with Arc B570. It\u2019s not a major shift in approach but the final appearance of the cooler is subtler and more pleasing to my eye relative to prior designs.\n\nImage: Club386.\n\nThere\u2019s a surprising amount of dimension on display at the front of Challenger OC Arc B570, with varying heights and materials that help elevate its monochrome colour palette. Complementing its plastic body are dashes of reflective acrylic and kevlar-esque cut-outs with predominantly sharp edges, all of which come together to give an industrial flair.\n\nThe card features two of ASRock\u2019s \u2018Striped Axial Fans\u2019. The ridged frosted plastic material of each blade subtly pops against the surrounding frontplate and aluminium heatsink below. The brand claims its design enhances airflow relative to standard fans. I\u2019ll discuss cooling performance in detail later in this review but for now I\u2019ll say they have good cooling chops.\n\nImage: Club386.\n\nFlipping the Challenger OC Arc B570 on its side, there\u2019s a thin RGB LED strip that occupies about a third of the card\u2019s length, nestled beneath the printed white ASRock logo. You can toggle it on or off via a small switch tucked away underneath the backplate, if you\u2019d prefer a completely stealthy pixel pusher.\n\nAll Arc B570 graphics cards use a single 8-pin PCIe cable for power delivery, and ASRock\u2019s offering is no exception. This makes it easy to slot it into builds sporting lower-wattage power supplies with fewer PCIe cables.\n\nImage: Club386.\n\nIn terms of display outputs, Arc B570 serves up three DisplayPort 2.1 inputs in addition to a sole HDMI 2.1 port. This is a welcomingly modern assortment of connections, even if this budget card won\u2019t be able to push any of them to their limits. Still, it\u2019s more than capable of handling a typical dual-monitor setup for games and tertiary applications like a web browser or Discord.\n\nPerformance\n\nGiven Arc B570 is largely similar in its makeup to Arc B580, I\u2019ve adopted the same approach to benchmarking it. Below, you\u2019ll find frame rates captured at FHD (1080p) and QHD (1440p) using one of the Club386 7950X3D test systems. Bare in mind that these frame rates will be slightly higher than reference performance, due to ASRock Challenger OC\u2019s overclocks.\n\nI\u2019ll be reusing the same frame rate data captured during my initial Arc B580 review for comparison points to Arc B570. I\u2019ve confirmed that subsequent driver performance since that card\u2019s launch haven\u2019t notably impacted performance nor, sadly, addressed prior issues.\n\n3DMark\n\n3DMark proves a mixed battleground for Arc B570. Starting strong, the card pulls ahead of all its competition bar its Battlemage sibling in the rasterised realms of Steel Nomad. However, it can\u2019t muster the same impressive performance once ray tracing enters the fold. In Speed Way, it falls from its prior second place position to second-last, beating only GeForce GTX 1060 which was never a contender in this particular race to begin with. Even Arc A750 handily and embarrassingly bests it.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Arc B570\u2019s reduced memory bandwidth relative to Arc B580 severely impacts its ray tracing performance. Combine this with apparent overhead issues at either an architectural or driver-level, and I believe this can account for the surprisingly low score in Speed Way. In fact, there\u2019s another benchmark that supports this trail of thought that I\u2019ll touch on soon.\n\nGaming\n\nArc B570 falls behind its more-expensive competition in Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage, both at FHD and QHD. While the gaps between it and others are more pronounced at lower resolutions, it\u2019s only a few frames behind when cranking the pixels higher.\n\nI\u2019m happy to see a marked improvement in Arc B570 relative to Arc A750 here at both resolutions. It\u2019s also worlds away from the near-decade old GeForce GTX 1060 that 3% of Steam users still rock at the time of writing.\n\nIncompatibilities surrounding Variable Rate Shading (VRS) hamper Arc B570 in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 as they did Arc B580. Despite the fact that each card supports the technology, there\u2019s been no progress in addressing the issue here. I haven\u2019t had any response from Intel regarding this matter in the past month either.\n\nThe frame rates above serve less as direct performance comparisons because of this. Nonetheless, they do act as a reminder that opting for Arc still unfortunately comes with some quirks despite Intel\u2019s continued efforts.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is the closest thing Arc B570 has to a victory so far. The card annihilates both Radeon RX 7600 and Arc A750 at FHD and QHD and is 1-2fps short of matching GeForce RTX 4060.\n\nOf course, this is sans any upscaling or frame generation. Both AMD and Nvidia benefit from CD Projekt Red\u2019s support for FSR 3 and DLSS 3 (soon to be 4). Intel, meanwhile, has XeSS Super Resolution and can rely on FSR Frame Generation but there\u2019s no sign of its own take on the tech hitting Night City anytime soon.\n\nRunning at QHD, Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail provides Arc B570 with another positive result, surpassing Radeon RX 7600 and Arc A750. It comes tantalisingly close to GeForce RTX 4060\u2019s average performance, but misses out by a hair. Still, it punches above its weight in the MMO.\n\nArc B570 concedes ground to Radeon RX 7600 at FHD, but the resolution also highlights problems with Intel\u2019s frame consistency. While average frame rates across all Arc graphics cards at each resolution are nice and high, their minimum frame rate is considerably lower than competitors. Such stark differences manifest in the form of stuttering, spoiling what should be a buttery-smooth experience at over 100fps.\n\nThrough Forza Motorsport, the problems exhibited in 3DMark Speed Way and Final Fantasy XIV combine and result in nothing short of a disastrous result at QHD. Even with more VRAM and a higher bandwidth relative to GeForce RTX 4060 and Radeon RX 7600 on its side, Arc B570 crumbles under the weight to the point that even Arc A750 delivers a higher minimum and average frame rate. To be clear, Arc B580 is the only card that can reliably perform under these intense ray traced conditions without fear of a memory leak, but the extent to which its sibling falters is disappointing to say the least.\n\nResults improve but still aren\u2019t perfect at FHD. A photo finish does see the card pass Radeon RX 7600 at this resolution in average frame rates but its minimums spoil what should be a unabashed point of celebration.\n\nAlthough Arc B570 finds itself at the back of the pack in Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, it nips at the heels of GeForce RTX 4060 at QHD with six frames per second separating the two cards. The gap becomes much larger at FHD, growing to 17fps against Nvidia\u2019s budget champion.\n\nCuriously Arc A750 shows up B570 at both resolutions. It\u2019s unclear why the more aged architecture has the edge here where it expectedly trails its successor in every other gaming benchmark. Regardless, given the issues described elsewhere I can only suspect they\u2019re at play here also.\n\nHolding its own against its rivals, Arc B570 is close to a dead ringer for both GeForce RTX 4060 and Radeon RX 7600 in Rainbow Six Extraction running at QHD. Dropping to FHD more distinctly separates the three cards, resulting in Intel once again trailing behind AMD and Nvidia, but it\u2019s largely a moot difference at frame rates this high.\n\nIt\u2019s worth nothing that Arc B570 (and B580) supports Intel\u2019s new XeLL (Low Latency) technology. It\u2019s essentially the company\u2019s answer to AMD Anti-Lag and Nvidia Reflex, improving system latency by reprioritising render queues to deliver the most up-to-date frames, making it easier to land that clutch play. While game integration should improve over time, there\u2019s a driver-level alternative that you can enable via Intel Graphics Software.\n\nVitals\n\nComparing Arc A750 power consumption to its B Series successors, it\u2019s clear that Intel has made significant strides in improving the efficiency of its graphics cards. Arc B570 should be the least-power hungry of the two pixel pushers the company has launched thus far thanks to its 150W TDP but that\u2019s not the case here. Overclocks typically require more power to remain stable, so it should come as no surprise that ASRock\u2019s Challenger OC pulls more watts, but I wasn\u2019t expecting to see it eclipse the reference Arc B580.\n\nFrustratingly, Intel still hasn\u2019t addressed issues concerning high idle power consumption. This makes for a doubly unflattering comparison to GeForce RTX 4060, which demands markedly fewer watts from the wall while under load and idle.\n\nIf there\u2019s one arena that Intel claims outright defeats its opponents it\u2019s thermals. Running at a cool 55\u00b0C under load, ASRock\u2019s Challenger cooler design certainly doesn\u2019t leave me wanting. To put that into context, it\u2019s five degrees chiller than GeForce RTX 4060 and a whopping 14\u00b0C lower than Radeon RX 7600. Much as I loved my GeForce GTX 1060, I greatly appreciate how much cooler most modern graphics cards run.\n\nAll that said, I am curious to see how hot Arc B570 could get with a smaller heatsink. The PCB isn\u2019t particularly large and perhaps just right for single fan design, which could result in more affordable if slightly hotter models.\n\nChallenger OC knows it keeps Arc B570 cool and doesn\u2019t need to shout about. Every tenth of a decibel here matters in this contest, though you\u2019re unlikely to hear any tangible difference between any of the 32-33db cards.\n\nOnce again, I\u2019m curious to see how much faster and noisier (if at all) a single fan would need to spin to keep Arc B570 cool.\n\nXeSS 2\n\nI\u2019ve already discussed what XeSS 2 is and how it works in my Arc B580 review, and I strongly recommend reading it if you want to more intimately familiarise yourself with the technology. For everyone else, the TL;DR is that Intel now has its own frame generation solution to complement its existing upscaling technologies which is packages together under the \u2018XeSS 2\u2019 banner.\n\nAt the time of writing, F1 24 is the only game to support the full XeSS 2 suite but more games are coming in the near future including the likes of Marvel Rivals, Assassin\u2019s Creed: Shadows, and more. As such, I\u2019ll be focussing on how it affects image quality and performance on Arc B570 in this game rather than making sweeping statements about it owing to the lack of comparison points.\n\nAverage fps +/- vs. Native Native (QHD) 41fps N/A XeSS (Performance) 66fps +61% XeSS-FG 73fps +78% XeSS (Perf) + FG 116fps +282%\n\nRunning F1 24 at native QHD, Ultra High settings, on Arc B570 isn\u2019t an ideal experience with average frame rates clocking in at 41fps. Thankfully, both XeSS upscaling and frame generation on their lonesome pick up the slack and push performance north of 60fps, which is the minimum frame rate I\u2019d deem acceptable for a racing game. Combining their powers to work together, the graphics card sees a complete transformation, delivering an awesome 116fps. That\u2019s a 282% improvement relative to native.\n\nComparing the quality of generated frames to the pre-release build I had to hand, there are some improvements. Rays from the track lights and their poles are more stable, as are the ever-difficult pixel thin lines that make up chain link fences. However, this has seemingly come at the cost of performance with Arc B580 performing slightly slower with this full release version of XeSS 2. Even so, the effect the suite has on performance remains transformative and I look forward to seeing it spread to other titles.\n\nOverclocking\n\nWhile still technically in beta, Intel Graphics Software\u2019s \u2018Tuning\u2019 tab offers several means of tuning and overclocking B570 and other Arc GPUs.\n\nThrough this menu, I\u2019m able to boost Arc B570\u2019s power limits by 12%. This is down from the 20% uplift I was able to implement on Arc B580. This warrants a more cautious approach, boosting frequency by 100MHz and memory speed to 20Gb/s.\n\nUnsurprisingly, such a piddly overclock makes little difference to my frame rates in Cyberpunk 2077, boosting average fps by a single digit. However, pushing this Challenger OC model any further results in system instabilities. This isn\u2019t a poor reflection on ASRock as it sells this card with an overclock ready to go out of the box, effectively doing some (if not all) of the hard work for you.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt pains me to say it but I can\u2019t recommend Arc B570 as its positive points come with far too many caveats. I commend Intel in its continued efforts to lift up the VRAM capacity and memory bandwidth of the budget market, but they don\u2019t matter if performance problems elsewhere effectively nullify these advantages. Improvements to CPU overhead and frame rate consistency can\u2019t come soon enough but there\u2019s no estimation on when these fixes will deliver, if at all. Intel has shared the following statement in the meantime: \u201cWe are aware of reports of performance sensitivity in some games when paired with older generation processors and we are investigating.\u201d\n\nImage: Club386.\n\n\u00a330 / $30 seperates Arc B570\u2019s MSRP from that of its beefier sibling, B580. I understand that every cent and penny you can scrimp together matters at this price point, making their value paramount. Were this gap slightly wider, perhaps \u00a350 / $50, then the value of Arc B570 would be readily apparent. As things stand, you\u2019re better off stretching your budget that little bit further for a graphics card that offers more value.\n\nMaking matters worse for Intel, prices of Radeon RX 7600 and GeForce RTX 4060 are continuing to fall and stock remains readily available for both rivals. Nevermind the fact that Radeon RX 9060 and GeForce RTX 5060 cards will likely show face in the coming months. This wouldn\u2019t be as large a problem had Arc B570 arrived on the scene much earlier as was initially planned. Sadly, in the here and now, it feels like too little, too late.\n\nVerdict: Arc B570 packs an attractive 10GB VRAM buffer at a low price, but it struggles to provide tangible value relative to its Battlemage sibling and rival graphics cards.",

            "content": "The server CPU market has long been dominated by Intel (INTC 0.94%) and AMD (AMD 2.30%). Both companies make chips based on the x86 architecture. While there are other types of CPUs used for specialized purposes -- think IBM mainframes -- x86 reigns supreme in the data center. Software is compiled and optimized for x86 chips, which creates significant switching costs.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM 2.10%) has already tried and failed once to bring chips based on the Arm architecture, which dominates the smartphone market, to the server market. Qualcomm's Centriq server CPUs failed to gain any traction when they were launched in late 2017, leading the company to greatly scale back its efforts. Switching to Arm-based chips or mixing-and-matching architectures just wasn't worth the effort for any major server CPU customer.\n\nTrying again\n\nQualcomm launched its first Arm-based PC CPUs last year, and although they haven't exactly been a smash hit, partly because of compatibility problems, Arm-based PC are likely to be here to stay. Qualcomm is now seemingly looking to re-enter the server CPU market with new chips.\n\nAccording to a LinkedIn post, Intel veteran and a chief architect of the Xeon server processor family Sailesh Kottapalli is joining Qualcomm after nearly three decades at Intel. In December, Qualcomm disclosed in a job posting that its data center team was working on server products for data center applications. Kottapalli is expected to lead that effort.\n\nWhile Qualcomm's PC chips have issues running certain types of applications, particularly games, using emulation, they provide solid performance and efficiency. Qualcomm can build on that work to go after the data center market.\n\nIt might be different this time\n\nBack in 2018, Qualcomm had little chance of success with its Centriq server CPUs. There was too much inertia behind x86, and the software ecosystem was centered around the dominant architecture.\n\nQualcomm might have better luck this time around thanks to artificial intelligence. Tech giants like Microsoft are spending mountains of money building brand new AI datacenters, and some are even designing their own Arm-based CPUs. The software stack is still evolving, and with Microsoft, Amazon, and others now getting behind Arm-based server CPUs, there's a lot more momentum in 2025 than there was in 2018.\n\nWhile the environment is more welcoming for Qualcomm, the company will face competition from potential customers' in-house chip design efforts as well as any other company that jumps into the market. Nvidia already sells its Grace family of data center CPUs based on the Arm architecture, and others could follow as Arm gains more traction.\n\nDon't count out Intel and AMD\n\nWhile Intel and AMD will face more competition if Qualcomm reenters the server CPU market, both companies have solid product lineups that will be tough to beat. Intel improved its competitive positioning last year with its powerful Granite Rapids chips and efficiency-focused Sierra Forest chips, and this year it plans to use its cutting-edge Intel 18A manufacturing process for Clearwater Forest.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD officially launched its Turin family of server CPUs in October, which goes up to 192 cores. Included in the lineup is a CPU specially designed to act as the host node CPU for a cluster of AI accelerators. AMD's last-generation server CPUs were a big hit, and the company will look to build on that progress.\n\nQualcomm appears to be gearing up to try again in the server CPU market. This time should go better than last time as the environment is far more conducive to Arm-based CPUs, but competition will be fierce.",

            "content": "The Intel Arc B580 surprised me when it launched in December 2024 by simply providing an excellent value for a $249 graphics card, especially in an era where GPUs are getting more expensive with each generation. The Intel Arc B570 also provides an awesome experience at a bargain price, but because it\u2019s not much cheaper than the B580, it becomes harder to recommend when you can just spend an extra $30 and get significantly better performance.\n\nTo be clear, $30 is $30, and that price difference can matter for a lot of people. But when that 8% difference in price means a 10-20% difference in performance, the B580 is clearly the superior buy.\n\nIntel Arc B570 \u2013 Photos 5 Images\n\nSpecs and Features\n\nThe Intel Arc B570 is built on the same Xe2 architecture as its big sibling, the Arc B580, and even features a GPU that looks eerily similar. Just like the B580, the B570 has the same SoC, the BMG-G21, with all its 19.6 billion transistors. The only difference is that two of the Xe Cores have been disabled, leaving the B570 with 18 cores to the B580\u2019s 20 cores.\n\nWhy would Intel just disable two cores? Well, when you\u2019re manufacturing GPUs, a number of units will have little faults in them, and you can restore them to full functionality by just disabling a few of the cores. GPU makers will usually sell these GPUs as a lower-end graphics card to make up for some of the losses, rather than just destroying them \u2013 a process known as binning. This isn\u2019t an approach that\u2019s unique to Intel \u2013 AMD and Nvidia do it all the time, too. But what it results in is a graphics card that uses the same basic GPU as a more powerful unit, but with around 10% less active silicon. You\u2019re only paying 8% less for it, so that makes sense \u2013 it even sounds like a good deal.\n\nHowever, the Intel Arc B570 also has a lower clock speed, with the peak graphics clock coming in at 2,750MHz, compared to the B580\u2019s 2,850MHz. Combine that with 10GB of VRAM on a 160-bit bus, compared to 12GB of VRAM on a 192-bit bus for the B580, and the odds start stacking up against the B570 to hold its own.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is the power budget, which is limited to a theoretical 150W. However, in my testing suite, the Intel Arc B570 peaked at about 131W of power. Less power consumption is usually a good thing, but at the same time, more power typically means better performance. Even though the Intel Arc B570 only has 10% less active Xe Cores than the B580, it has a 16% lower power budget, which only spells trouble when it comes to performance \u2013 but more on that later. All of this can be explained by the Xe Cores on the B570 not being quite as efficient as the B580, which would explain Intel\u2019s conservative approach to power budget and clock speed. But if it results in a worse product, that doesn\u2019t matter much, especially when Intel could have dropped the price by $10-$20 more \u2013 a $199 B570 would be a much more attractive buy than a $219 one, after all.\n\nLuckily, because the Intel Arc B570 is built on the Xe2 graphics architecture, it gets access to the awesome new features added with this generation of cards. Features like XeSS Frame Generation bring AI-powered frame interpolation to this budget graphics card. Just like Nvidia\u2019s DLSS 3 FG, XeSS-FG analyzes data from each frame to create entirely new frames. Meanwhile, XeLL, or Low Latency, zeroes out the CPU render queue to cut down on latency when you\u2019re gaming. This ends up being necessary when frame generation is enabled, as those interpolated frames introduce latency, and need XeLL to avoid introducing noticeable input lag.\n\nIntel Arc B570 \u2013 Benchmarks 16 Images\n\nPerformance\n\nWhen the dust settles, the Intel Arc B570 is a capable little graphics card at 1440p, and especially at 1080p, where it really shines. If you\u2019re still using a 1080p gaming monitor, it\u2019s rare to find a game where the B570 won\u2019t excel with all the settings cranked, and that includes ray tracing.\n\nIn 3DMark, the Intel Arc B570 scores 1,946 points in Speed Way, compared to 2,468 from the Arc B580 and 2,042 from the AMD Radeon RX 7600, making for a sizable drop in performance. The delta between the B570 and B580 narrows a bit in Steel Nomad, with 2,675 and 3,082 points, respectively. 3DMark is better for testing the theoretical limits of a graphics card, rather than real world performance, but a 22% gap between the B570 and B580 doesn\u2019t look pretty for the slightly more affordable GPU.\n\nIn Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at 1440p, I tested on the \u2018extreme\u2019 preset with vendor appropriate upscaling \u2013 XeSS for Intel, FSR for AMD, etc \u2013 on the \u2018Balanced\u2019 setting, and found that the B570 delivers a very playable 64 fps. Lower the resolution to 1080p, and that number goes up to 74 fps. However, you can spend $30 more on the B580 and get 73 fps at 1440p and 83 fps at 1080p. This is going to be a recurring theme.\n\nIt\u2019s actually surprising how well the B570 handles Cyberpunk 2077. This game typically prefers Nvidia graphics cards, especially with ray tracing enabled, but the Arc B570 gets an admirable 64 fps at 1080p, compared to 72 fps from the B580. Considering the $249 Radeon RX 7600 still fails to reach past 42 fps at 1080p, it could be a lot worse here.\n\nTest System CPU AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Motherboard Asus ROG Crosshair X870E Hero RAM 32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo @ 6,000MHz SSD 4TB Samsung 990 Pro CPU Cooler Asus ROG Ryujin III 360\n\nMetro Exodus: Enhanced Edition is a weird game to test, as the only upscaling it supports is DLSS \u2013 which means I test the game with it disabled. This was one of the first games to force ray tracing on, and the Arc B570 is only able to get an average of 46 fps on the Extreme preset at 1080p. Likewise, the B580 struggles at the same resolution and settings, getting 52 fps. Even the Nvidia RTX 4060 has similar struggles in this game, though, getting 43 fps.\n\nIn Red Dead Redemption 2, the Arc B570 is able to keep up at both 1440p and 1080p, getting 76 fps and 88 fps, respectively. This is a game that only supports FSR, which means I do enable it for all vendors, but what\u2019s surprising is that the B570 manages to outperform the Radeon RX 7600 \u2013 even though the upscaler is an AMD technology. Impressive stuff. However, the B580 still carries a 14% lead in this game with 87 fps at 1440p and 101 fps at 1080p.\n\nTotal War: Warhammer 3 is one of the few games in my testing suite that doesn\u2019t support either ray tracing or upscaling, so it gives a clear picture on pure rasterization performance. And, well, the B570 still trails the B580 by 17% at 1080p, despite an 8% price gap.\n\nSurprisingly, Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage seems to narrow the gap between the B580 and B570. This is a game that\u2019s pretty heavy on the CPU, which is something to be aware of due to the CPU overhead issues going on with Battlemage right now, spotted by HardwareCanucks . However, paired with an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the B570 manages to get an average of 81 fps at 1440p, compared to 91 fps from the B580. However, keep in mind that the RTX 4060 gets 126 fps at this same resolution, with the AMD Radeon RX 7600 getting 95 fps. This makes Mirage an outlier in favor of Nvidia, but it\u2019s still something to be aware of if you play a lot of Assassin\u2019s Creed.\n\nWhen I test Black Myth Wukong, I set it to the Cinematic preset, which is extremely demanding, no matter what graphics card you have in your system. Both Intel graphics cards struggle in this game, with the Intel Arc B570 managing 26 fps at 1080p, with the B580 only getting 31 fps. This is a game where you\u2019re probably not going to want an Intel card, but it\u2019s a test that I\u2019m looking to re-examine going forward.\n\nForza Horizon 5 is getting a bit old at this point, but it\u2019s still a demanding game that rewards a strong graphics card. At 1080p with the Extreme preset and XeSS set to \u2018Quality\u2019, the Arc B570 manages to average 97 fps, compared to 109 fps from the B580. At 1440p, the performance gap between the two remains largely the same, with the B570 getting 84 fps to the B580\u2019s 94 fps.\n\nThe Intel Arc B570 maintains strong competition against the more-expensive RTX 4060 and AMD RX 7600. If this card existed in a vacuum, it would be much easier to recommend, as it is extremely capable at 1080p and 1440p, which is exactly what I want out of a $219 graphics card. However, Intel is its own worst enemy. Because the Intel Arc B580 is just $30 more expensive, at $249, it makes a lot of sense to save up an extra 30 bucks to get a more powerful card. This is especially true in games like Cyberpunk 2077 where the difference between a B580 and a B570 is getting 60 fps or not at 1440p.\n\nWhen all is said and done, the average cost per frame across our test suite doesn\u2019t show that much of a difference between the Intel B570 and B580. But when we\u2019re talking about the difference between 60 fps and 50 fps, that difference is going to be much more noticeable than it would be on a more powerful GPU.\n\nIt would be so much easier to recommend the Intel Arc B570 if it was a $199 card, rather than $219. At that price, it\u2019d be 20% cheaper and a much better deal than the B580. Instead, when it comes to a pure value perspective, it\u2019s a wash between the two graphics cards, but you\u2019re going to feel the difference in more demanding PC games.\n\nJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

Find out more about how we test.\n\nThe Intel Arc B570 picks up where the Arc B580 left off, namely with an even lower price point of $219. On paper, that's 12% cheaper, but it also comes with a 10% reduction in core counts, 3.5% lower clocks, and most importantly a 17% reduction in VRAM capacity and bandwidth. If you're trying to save money it might be worth considering, but the value proposition isn't as strong as the B580. It will compete with the best graphics cards of the rising generation, but only by virtue of very likely being the least expensive new GPU that we'll see in the coming year.\n\n\n\nWe've covered the Intel Battlemage architecture and the Arc B-series GPUs already. Now it's time to see how the B570 stacks up in real-world testing. Shaving $30 off the price while also cutting the memory by 2GB may not be the best solution for gaming or AI usage going forward. But let's start with the specifications.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Graphics Card Arc B570 Arc B580 Arc A770 16GB Arc A750 Arc A580 Architecture BMG-G21 BMG-G21 ACM-G10 ACM-G10 ACM-G10 Process Technology TSMC N5 TSMC N5 TSMC N6 TSMC N6 TSMC N6 Transistors (Billion) 19.6 19.6 21.7 21.7 21.7 Die size (mm^2) 272 272 406 406 406 Xe-Cores 18 20 32 28 24 GPU Shaders (ALUs) 2304 2560 4096 3584 3072 XMX Cores 144 160 512 448 384 Ray Tracing Cores 18 20 32 28 24 Boost Clock (MHz) 2750 2850 2400 2400 1700 VRAM Speed (Gbps) 19 19 17.5 16 16 VRAM (GB) 10 12 16 8 8 VRAM Bus Width 160 192 256 256 256 L2 Cache 13.5 18 16 16 16 Render Output Units 80 80 128 128 128 Texture Mapping Units 144 160 256 224 192 TFLOPS FP32 (Boost) 12.7 14.6 19.7 17.2 10.4 TFLOPS FP16 (INT8 TOPS) 101 (203) 117 (233) 157 (315) 138 (275) 84 (167) Bandwidth (GB/s) 380 456 560 512 512 TBP (watts) 150 190 225 225 185 Launch Date Jan 2025 Dec 2024 Oct 2022 Oct 2022 Oct 2023 Launch Price $219 $249 $349 $289 $179 Online Price $220 $341 $300 $190 $170\n\nAs noted already, the Arc B5780 takes the same BMG-G21 core and trims a few functional units, with a lower core clock as well. The resulting card ends up with 13% less theoretical compute and 17% less memory bandwidth \u2014 and also 17% less memory capacity.\n\n\n\nWe haven't seen very many 10GB graphics cards over the year. There was the original RTX 3080, and more recently AMD's RX 6700 (non-XT), and that's basically it. We know there are quite a few modern games that can exceed 8GB of VRAM use, so the B570 may have a bit more wiggle room. However, lossless memory compression techniques in GPUs can also have an impact, so raw capacity isn't the final word.\n\n\n\nConsidering the Arc B580 ended up outperforming the prior generation Arc A770 by around 20%, we expect the new B570 to be slightly faster than the A770 as well. Except, higher resolutions where the extra VRAM capacity and bandwidth come into play will likely still favor the older GPU. Not that you'd really want to pick up an A770 16GB, considering they're now selling at $300 or more again.\n\n\n\nIntel gives the Arc B570 a Graphics Clock of 2500 MHz, with a maximum boost clock of 2750 MHz. We noticed with the B580 that all the cards, including factory overclocked models, seemed to keep the maximum boost clock, and that appears to be the case with the B570 as well. Without manual overclocking, you'll get 2750 MHz peak performance, and in practice nearly every game and application we tested hit that clock speed.\n\n(Image credit: Asus)\n\nGiven the $219 MSRP, the Arc B570 will primarily face off against existing GPUs from AMD and Nvidia. Nvidia hasn't made a sub-$249 graphics card since the RTX 3050 8GB debuted in early 2022, three years ago. It now goes for $200, while supplies remain. There's also a more recent RTX 3050 6GB card as well, which we haven't tested, that sells for $170.\n\n\n\nBut we never particularly cared for the RTX 3050 cards. They were too slow for ray tracing to be a selling point, and in rasterization performance AMD's RX 6600 was clearly superior \u2014 it even competes with the higher spec RTX 3060 12GB. Our RX 6600 vs RTX 3050 GPU faceoff ended up being a clear victory for the RX 6600, mostly based on its superior performance. Despite being over three years old, the RX 6600 remains readily available, with prices starting at $190.\n\n\n\nTime constraints (with holiday breaks and CES travels) meant we couldn't test every GPU we'd like to include for this review. We'll have the same cards as the Arc B580, plus a couple of additions (RTX 3060 and RX 6600). But before we get to the benchmarks, let's take a closer look at the ASRock Arc B570 Challenger OC we received for review.",

He\u2019s played a key role in discussions around how to collaborate with the Space Force to provide ground target tracking capabilities from space, as well as the NRO\u2019s efforts to leverage space-based commercial imagery services and launch a proliferated satellite constellation.\n\nIf confirmed, Meink will lead both the Air Force and the Space Force. His background in space-system acquisition and development could drive more funding toward Space Force priorities as the service looks to double or triple its budget in the coming years to meet an expanding mission set.\n\nHis nomination comes as the Air Force faces a significant decision about how to fund its current and future portfolio of fighter aircraft, as well as its nuclear modernization programs.

In fact, a recent report from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that U.S. data centers consumed about 4.4% of total electricity in 2023 and projects them to potentially triple consumption by 2028. Widespread deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) is a driving factor of this rise in energy consumption and is already having an economic impact as electricity costs rise for consumers.\n\nResearchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) are shining a light on this energetic cost of computing. Along with investigating methods to make computing more energy efficient, researchers are working to disseminate tools and insights beyond the research sphere to industry software professionals.\n\nA recent result of these efforts is \u201cA Beginner\u2019s Guide to Power and Energy Measurement and Estimation,\u201d a new NREL report developed in partnership with Intel that outlines key considerations for machine learning developers and practitioners seeking to use energy measurement tools and interpret energy estimates.\n\n\u201cWith AI playing a growing role in both research and industry, its increasing impact on energy consumption has become a shared challenge we can tackle together,\u201d said Hilary Egan, data scientist and lead NREL author on the report. \u201cThrough this guide, we wanted to provide AI professionals with an introduction to energy estimation that opens the door to more sustainable decision-making in computing.\u201d\n\nTaking AIm: Partnering To Address AI\u2019s Energy Use Challenge\n\nNREL\u2019s commitment to reducing computing\u2019s\u2014and AI\u2019s\u2014energy consumption inspired the launch of the Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis (JISEA) Green Computing Catalyzer in 2022. The Green Computing Catalyzer is one arm of JISEA\u2019s Catalyzer Program exploring strategic areas for investment in future energy opportunities and brings together researchers, universities, and industry partners to analyze pathways to reduce computing\u2019s energy impact.\n\nOver its tenure, the Green Computing Catalyzer has supported efforts to quantify and catalog the energetic costs of machine learning and NREL\u2019s advanced computing systems, with the goal of providing a means for more transparency and accountability in computing. These efforts caught the attention of Intel, which leads its own collection of Responsible AI initiatives.\n\nTogether, the Green Computing Catalyzer and Intel developed \u201cA Beginner\u2019s Guide to Power and Energy Measurement and Estimation,\u201d aiming to equip developers with the skills they need to conduct productive energy measurement in their computing. This allows developers and their companies to make informed decisions about the sustainability of their systems.\n\n\u201cSustainability has been a longstanding priority at Intel, both before the advent of AI and now,\u201d said Ronak Singhal, senior fellow in the Datacenter and AI group at Intel. \u201cNREL\u2019s contributions were crucial in bringing to life our shared publication, which equips developers with the skills to make intelligent measurement decisions\u2014a vital first step on the road towards sustainability in AI.\u201d\n\nShaping a Measurement Framework for AI\u2019s Energy Usage\n\nWhile some AI/machine-learning developers and cloud companies are beginning to incorporate energy considerations into the development of their various models, there is no uniform standard framework for measuring energy use across all computational levels. The new guide serves as a helpful resource to make energy efficiency tools and procedures more accessible, while establishing a framework for measuring energy at the system, job, application, and code levels.\n\nThe report offers a roadmap for determining computing\u2019s energy usage from both hardware and software perspectives and discusses the challenges of interpreting these measurements as useful estimates. It also contains practical tips and real-world scenarios that illustrate the application of different energy considerations that can be used across the computing industry.\n\nPractitioners using the guide will start at the beginning of the energy project measurement workflow: determining the key questions to answer. The guide then walks through how to determine the appropriate and feasible measurement tools to gather the data that then must be analyzed and interpreted. Finally, the roadmap helps practitioners and their companies determine the sufficiency of the analysis, which may lead to refinement of questions and measurements.\n\nOverall, the report provides measurement, analysis, and interpretation guidance from the system level\u2014how a collection of workloads affects energy usage\u2014to the code level\u2014quantifying the energy consumed by parts of a job or application.\n\n\u201cThe Catalyzer Program addresses critical, intersectional energy challenges,\u201d said NREL\u2019s Kristin Wegner Guilfoyle, Catalyzer Program lead. \u201cThis roadmap helps achieve that goal by connecting the progress made by energy-efficient computing researchers with the innovations driven by software developers and practitioners.\u201d\n\nRead \u201cA Beginner\u2019s Guide to Power and Energy Measurement and Estimation\u201d and the accompanying blog from Intel, and learn more about NREL\u2019s energy-efficient advanced computing systems operation work.\n\nNote: The Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis retired in February 2025.",

            "content": "Intel faced fierce competition and strategic shifts last year. Is the company poised for a comeback in the near future?\n\nShares of Intel (INTC 1.37%) plunged 60.1% lower in 2024, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The semiconductor veteran ran into many issues last year, and the string of bad luck started many years ago. Complicating the picture even further, Intel is in the middle of an ambitious, costly, and difficult strategy shift.\n\nIntel's rough ride\n\nIntel's business performance was a mixed bag in 2024. The company missed the analyst community's revenue and earnings targets as often as it exceeded them, and the upcoming fourth-quarter report will probably show far weaker results than the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe reasons behind Intel's financial weakness are not simple. Sector rival Nvidia (NVDA 3.94%) is running away with the juiciest chip-supply deals in the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market. Longtime underdog Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 2.43%) has earned a historically large slice of important opportunities, such as server-grade chips and PC processors.\n\nAnd some of Intel's largest shareholders ran out of patience with a long and expensive turnaround effort, forcing CEO Pat Gelsinger out of the company. The large business expenses are still going on -- Intel is spending as much as $100 billion on a five-year plan to support its third-party semiconductor manufacturing services for other chip designers.\n\nSo Intel's bearish stock chart makes some sense. The company faces a plethora of challenges and is currently running under an interim management team, spending lots of cash on a very different business plan.\n\nBetting big on America's chip future\n\nHere's the thing: Intel is building a distinctly American pipeline for chipmaking services at a uniquely promising moment.\n\nThe American government isn't getting along with its counterparts in Beijing, adding political tension with rising costs and regulatory restrictions to any business idea that involves semiconductors. At the same time, demand for leading-edge chips is at an all-time high. There's the generative AI revolution, rising chip counts in modern cars (even the ones with classic internal combustion engines), and people are finally buying new smartphones again. In every crevice of this soaring demand picture, you'll find a need for faster chips and more digital memory.\n\nIn my view, Intel is leaning into a fantastic growth opportunity at exactly the right time. The company can't become an American giant of this crucial industry overnight, but is making great progress toward earning that title in the next couple of years. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.84%) is a trillion-dollar market darling for good reason, and Intel is stepping up to challenge this global giant on American soil.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel's stock trades at the bargain-bin valuation of 1.6 times sales or 20.3 times forward earnings estimates. AMD trades at 8 times sales, Taiwan Semiconductor has earned a 12.9x price-to-sales ratio, and Nvidia is soaring at 29.3 times sales. Intel's stock price could multiply several times over and still look cheap in this group.\n\nThe chipmaking foundry division generated $4.4 billion of sales in the third quarter of 2024, building custom chips for tech titans like Amazon. That's one way to take advantage of the AI boom without a leading AI accelerator among your own chip-design blueprints.\n\nIn other words, Intel is going down a profitable long-term path, but the stock is dirt cheap. It's a no-brainer buy, in my opinion. In fact, I had to delay this article a few days because I bought a few more Intel shares last week.",

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Intel's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n\nThe top 25 shareholders own 42% of the company\n\nRecent sales by insiders\n\nA look at the shareholders of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 62% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nAs a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$2.9b. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 58% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as \"smart money\", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Intel which might hurt individual investors.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Intel.\n\nView our latest analysis for Intel\n\nNasdaqGS:INTC Ownership Breakdown January 15th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intel?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nIntel already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Intel's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nNasdaqGS:INTC Earnings and Revenue Growth January 15th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Intel is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.9% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.6% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.",

It is the latest in a series of structural changes the chip maker is making.\n\nThis, writes CNBC. Intel Capital, which manages a $5 billion portfolio of assets, will separate from Intel Capital, which will allow it to raise money from outside investors, Intel said. Until now, Intel has funded the venture capital arm entirely.\n\nNew name for Intel Capital\n\nIn the announcement, the company reported that Intel Capital staff will continue to work at the investment firm when it becomes independent in the second half of 2025. A spokesman declined to comment on specific executives\u2019 plans. Intel Capital could also be renamed.\n\nIntel is experiencing its worst stock market year since going public in 1971. This is due to a series of missteps and a significant loss of market share. The company is cutting costs and simplifying its operations. At the same time, it is investing heavily in building advanced chip factories and trying to revive the PC chip branch.\n\nRound of layoffs\n\nIn December, Intel fired CEO Pat Gelsinger after four years of leadership. Two interim co-CEOs, David Zinzner and Michelle Holthaus, replaced him. Under Gelsinger, Intel sold or closed several smaller divisions over the past two years. Last year, the company also laid off employees as part of a cost-cutting plan.\n\nIntel Capital was founded in 1991 and was unique as a venture capital arm of a large company at the time. Since then, this model has been copied in Silicon Valley by companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n\nSAP also divested investment arm\n\nAlthough Intel was a pioneer in corporate venture capital, it is not the first technology company to spin off its investment arm. In 2011, SAP turned its SAP Ventures into an independent company, later called Sapphire Ventures.\n\nCorporate venture capital peaked in 2021, when companies in this sector raised $156 billion. According to the National Venture Capital Association, they were involved in nearly 3,800 deals. That was the same year the broader VC market reached record levels. Investment in startups has fallen dramatically since then. This is mainly due to interest rates, which began to rise in 2022.",

It has also re-organized to make its foundry business an independent entity, sold its stake in rival processor designer Arm, offloaded its Altera FPGA business, and taken many other actions to consolidate its product portfolio and/or save money.\n\nFinding money for the risky-by-nature investments that venture funds pursue must be hard in that climate of cuts and austerity.\n\nIntel Capital managing partner Anthony Lin posted a letter to portfolio company investees that argues they have nothing to fear and plenty to gain.\n\nUsing words that are near-identical to those in Intel\u2019s press release, Lim wrote: \u201cThis change brings our corporate structure in line with other leading venture firms and presents exciting opportunities for our future.\u201d\n\nMr Intel leaving Intel is not a great sign... for Intel CEO OUT\n\nHe further argued that a standalone Intel Capital \u201cwill have the autonomy and flexibility to raise external capital to grow our franchise and expand our network of investors and partners,\u201d and \u201cwill create an even more robust and geographically diverse ecosystem of resources, expertise and market access to accelerate your growth.\u201d\n\nJust how that will happen isn\u2019t explained. To hazard a guess, Intel Capital will pitch its track record of making successful investments and the chance to tap that expertise, and investors will clamber aboard.\n\nChange will come fast to Intel Capital, which will change name and start operating as a standalone entity sometime in the second half of 2025.\n\nIf investors had a reaction to the news, it wasn\u2019t fulsome as Intel\u2019s share price started Tuesday trading at $19.36, ended it at $19.20, and is now $19.18 in after-hours. \u00ae",

            "content": "Almost three years ago, in February 2022, US chips giant Intel announced that it would buy Israel's Tower Semiconductor (TASE: TSEM; Nasdaq: TSEM) at a valuation of $5.4 billion. The deal was eventually cancelled, in the summer of 2023, after the companies failed to obtain approvals from the Chinese regulator in time. The acquisition was due to take place at a share price of $53 for Tower Semiconductor, representing a premium of 60% on the market price on the day the deal was announced.\n\nWithin a few months of the cancellation of the deal, Tower Semiconductor's share price fell to a low of just $22, but is has since recovered, and is now close to the $53 at which the acquisition by Intel was meant to happen. Tower Semiconductor's current market cap is $5.7 billion, a more than twenty-year peak, after a rise of almost 70% in the share price in 2024 (following a fall of 30% in 2023 in the wake of the cancellation of the deal with Intel). Over the past three years, the share price has risen by about 25%.\n\nWith the wisdom of hindsight, and given Intel's travails in the past few months, it would appear that the cancellation of the acquisition deal was ultimately to Tower's benefit, as it continues as an independent company under the leadership of veteran CEO Russell Ellwanger. In an interview with \"Globes\" last March, Ellwanger related how he felt when the deal with Intel was cancelled. \"I won't say it's good that the deal didn't happen, but it wasn't a big slap in the face. We now have capacity, although of course there are things to improve, and on the whole, it was a positive experience,\" he said.\n\nTower Semiconductor Headquarter Office, Israel. (credit: Wikimedia Commons)\n\nMoreover, the analog chip producer from Migdal Ha'emek did not emerge from the episode empty handed. The acquisition agreement specified that, in the event of the deal being cancelled, Intel would pay Tower $353 million. Tower recognized the compensation payment in its third quarter 2023 financials, boosting its post-tax net profit by $290 million.\n\nThe intended buyer, Intel, however, found itself in financial difficulties in 2024, and its CEO Pat Gelsinger recently stepped down after four years in the position. Intel sought to buy Tower because it fitted in with its foundry strategy: manufacturing chips for third parties as well as for itself, and Tower was meant to be a fundamental part of that strategy. The strategy did not take off, and Intel laid of thousands of employees around the world, including in Israel. In 2024, as Tower's share price soared, Intel's sank 60%.\n\nOutperformance\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) rose 13% last year, so Tower Semiconductor handily outperformed the index. Returns on the sector globally were impacted by contrasting factors. On the one hand, chips giant Nvidia continued to climb, thanks to the AI hype, and Broadcom and other semiconductor stocks gave impressive returns last year. On the other hand, fears arose over restrictions on exports to China, and stockpiles at some companies.\n\nAnalysts who cover Tower are positive about the stock. According to Yahoo! Finance, their average price target is $57.5, 13% above the current price on Nasdaq.\n\nOppenheimer has a price target of $60 for Tower, representing 18% upside, and its rating is \"Outperform\". Last month, Oppenheimer analysts Sergey Vastchenok and Avivit Mannet-Kalil published an update following a meeting with Tower's management, and said they expected accelerated growth in 2025, in the light of demand for RF/SiPho (silicon photonics) chips for the optic communications market in data centers, at the same time as a recovery in areas that exhibited cyclical weakness last year, and an increase in market share.\n\nIn recent years, Tower has worked to expand its production capacity, and after the cancellation of the acquisition agreement with Intel, it signed an agreement for the use of Intel's factory in New Mexico for manufacturing 300 mm chips. Tower also has a new factory in Italy, about which Oppenheimer writes that the start of production there will reduce gross profit margins in the short term, but that it will provide a new growth engine for the coming years, and accelerate growth rates and boost future profitability. Advertisement\n\n\"Production expansion potential not yet priced into stock\"\n\nOppenheimer's analysts estimate that the factory will reach full capacity towards the end of 2025. \"In our view, this potential has yet to receive full expression in investors' expectations and in the pricing of Tower stock, which is still traded at a deep discount to the semiconductor sector average,\" Vastchenok and Mannet-Kalil write. They add that Tower will record similar revenue for 2024 to that for 2023, which represents outperformance in comparison with the high single digit decline in the analog chip market, and a double-digit decline at some of its major competitors. This is against the background of demand for RF/SiPho chips, sales of which have trebled and are expected to continue growing in 2025. Stay updated with the latest news!

Demand for power management chips for the industrial and vehicle markets are expected to demonstrate recovery in the coming year from its low, and at the same time Tower will expand its market share, thanks to the launch of products for the low power management segment,\" the Oppenheimer analysts write.\n\nAccording to the analysts' forecasts, Tower will report revenue of $1.44 billion for 2024, slightly above the $1.42 billion in 2023. Growth is expected to accelerate in 2025. The consensus analysts' estimate is revenue of $1.57 billion, representing growth of 9%.",

            "content": "Daniel Munch Economist\n\nForeign ownership of U.S. agricultural land, which includes timberland, remains a widely debated and often controversial topic, fueled by concerns about the implications of foreign investments \u2014 especially those from nations viewed as adversarial to the U.S. Since our previous analysis, Foreign Investment in U.S. Ag Land \u2013 The Latest Numbers, two additional years of data \u2014 2022 and 2023 \u2014 have become available. This article updates the trends in foreign ownership, revealing a 1.58-million-acre increase in foreign-held agricultural land between 2022 and 2023, driven primarily by investments linked to renewable energy projects. At the same time, the data shows a decrease in acreage owned by Chinese-based entities, reflecting shifting patterns in foreign land acquisition. Background The Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 (AFIDA) requires foreign entities to report purchases, sales and interests in U.S. agricultural land to USDA via Form-153 submitted to the Farm Service Agency. It defines foreign entities broadly, including individuals, companies and even foreign governments, but excludes U.S. citizens and green card holders. Non-compliance can result in fines up to 25% of the land's market value, though USDA has largely depended on voluntary self-reporting for its data. In 2024, under heightened congressional scrutiny, USDA imposed a record $1.2 million in penalties, including $13,374 for non-filings and the remainder for late filings. While these penalties remain modest relative to USDA\u2019s full enforcement authority, they mark progress in strengthening oversight and compliance under AFIDA. Additionally, 2023 saw a record number of AFIDA reports filed since the program\u2019s inception, with filings increasing by 5% compared to 2022. Of the 2,095 additional reports, 1,686 were tied to unique 2023 acquisitions, while 409 detailed transactions from prior years that likely should have been reported earlier. This surge in reporting may reflect growing public and congressional focus on foreign ownership of U.S. agricultural land. For a deeper dive into the limitations of data collection and enforcement under AFIDA and policy considerations related to the foreign ownership topic area, see our previous analysis. Additionally, to learn more about the second key mechanism for scrutinizing foreign investments in U.S. agriculture, explore How it Works \u2014 Understanding the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Summary of Data According to USDA\u2019s latest AFIDA report, 45.85 million acres of U.S. agricultural land were held by foreign investors in 2023, which represents 3.61% of total privately held agricultural land in the United States. This marks a 1.58-million-acre (3.6%) increase from 2022 and a 5-million-acre (12.2%) rise since our prior analysis based on 2021 data. Canadian investors own the largest portion of foreign-held U.S. agricultural land with 33.5% (15.35 million acres) of the total and 1.21% of all U.S. agricultural land (Figure 1). Following Canada, investors from the Netherlands, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany own 0.41% (5.2 million acres), 0.22% (2.7 million acres), 0.11% (2.6 million acres) and 0.20% (2.5 million acres) of U.S. agricultural land, respectively. Figure 2 further breaks down foreign-investor-held land by predominant origin nation.\n\nSince 2010, reported foreign-held agricultural land in the U.S. has grown by 21 million acres \u2014 an 85% increase \u2014 averaging an annual gain of 1.62 million acres. This expansion, equivalent to an area larger than the state of South Carolina, has raised foreign ownership from 2% to 3.6% of all privately held agricultural land in the country. In 2023, 48% (21.9 million acres) of reported foreign-held agricultural land was forestland, 29% (13.2 million acres) was cropland, 17% (7.7 million acres) was pastureland and 6% (2.9 million acres) was other agricultural land and non-ag land, which accounts for factors like owner or worker housing and rural roads. Over the past five years (between 2018 and 2023), foreign investments in U.S. agricultural land have seen growth across all categories: a 101% increase in cropland, 28% in forestland, 15% in pastureland and 38% in other agricultural land. This reveals heightened interest by foreign investors in cropland as opposed to other land categories.\n\nBy state, Texas has the largest quantity of foreign-held U.S. agricultural land at 5.7 million acres making up 3.6% of the state\u2019s 158 million acres of privately held agricultural land. Maine has the second-largest quantity of foreign-held U.S. agricultural land at 3.5 million acres but leads for highest proportion of foreign-held ag acreage with over 21% of the state\u2019s 16.5 million acres of ag land being held by foreign investors. In both Texas and Maine, foreign ownership is primarily driven by forest products and timber companies. Hawai\u2019i also has a significant share of foreign-owned agricultural land, with 17% (283,000 of its 1.6 million agricultural acres) largely tied to renewable energy investments. Figure 4 illustrates the change in foreign-held agricultural acreage by state from 2022 to 2023. Forty-two states saw increases in foreign-owned ag land, led by New Mexico (+358,149 acres), Texas (+223,165 acres), Arkansas (+182,955 acres), Oregon (+167,108 acres) and South Carolina (+84,708 acres). Growth in New Mexico and Texas is primarily tied to new or expanded wind energy investments, while increases in Arkansas, Oregon and South Carolina are largely linked to timber industry expansions. Hawai\u2019i experienced the largest year-over-year percentage increase, with a 33% jump in foreign-held land, driven by wind energy projects. Meanwhile, three states \u2014 Alaska, Connecticut and Rhode Island \u2014 along with Puerto Rico, had no change in foreign-owned acreage. Five states \u2014 Alabama, Michigan, Indiana, Montana and Iowa \u2014 experienced declines, with Alabama recording the largest numerical decrease (-158,068 acres) and percentage drop (-7%), primarily due to reduced holdings by foreign timber companies.\n\nRenewable Energy Production Driving Foreign Investments Under AFIDA, foreign investments in U.S. agricultural land include long-term leases of 10 years or more. This provision is particularly relevant for renewable energy companies, many of which, especially foreign entities, secure land through extended leases rather than outright purchases. This approach provides access to large tracts of land for projects like wind farms and solar arrays while minimizing the financial burden of ownership. While AFIDA data does not specify the exact purpose of each foreign land acquisition, certain terms in the names of reporting entities \u2014 such as \u201cwind,\u201d \u201csolar,\u201d \u201cenergy\u201d and \u201crenewable\u201d \u2014 can serve as proxies for identifying renewable energy-focused companies. This analysis estimates the extent of foreign interest in U.S. agricultural land for renewable energy development over time by aggregating the acreage associated with these terms. Canadian investors accounted for the largest share at 5.5 million acres, followed by Italian investors with 2.57 million acres and Portuguese investors with 1.2 million acres. Notably, of the top 10 nations in this category, only one \u2014 Australia \u2014 is located outside Europe, reflecting the region's commitment to renewable energy development and compliance with government mandates for carbon emissions reductions, which likely drive these investments. In 2023, over 70% of the acreage linked to renewable energy companies was cropland, with 22% classified as pastureland, 6% as other agricultural land, and the remaining 2% as forestland. Breaking it down by keyword associations in entity names, 11.21 million acres (84%) were linked to entities containing the term \"wind\"; 4.8 million acres (36%) to entities with \"energy\"; 1.47 million acres (11%) to those with \"solar\"; and 404,000 acres (3%) to entities with \"renewable.\" It is important to note that some entity names include multiple terms, leading to an overlap in these values.\n\nSince 2010, foreign renewable energy investments in U.S. agricultural land have increased by at least 10.4 million acres \u2014 a 353% rise, accounting for nearly half of the 21-million-acre total increase in foreign-owned ag land during this period. In the past five years (2018\u20132023), this trend has intensified, with renewable energy entities driving 76% of the total growth in foreign-owned agricultural land, contributing 7.55 million acres out of the 9.96-million-acre increase. Between 2022 and 2023 alone, entities with renewable energy-related terms in their names accounted for 54% of the 1.58-million-acre increase. It\u2019s important to note that these figures represent minimum estimates, as not all renewable energy companies are captured through these specific terms. These trends highlight renewable energy investment as a major driver of the increasing foreign interest in U.S. agricultural land. The use of agricultural land for wind and solar energy production is a contentious topic, often sparking debates over whether it removes prime farmland from production or upholds landowners\u2019 rights to use, sell or lease their property as they choose. A recent analysis, Solar Energy Expansion and its Impacts on Rural Communities, explores these topics more in depth. As corporations face mounting pressure to meet environmental goals, investments in land for renewable energy projects are likely to continue. Many European nations, which have some of the strictest carbon offset mandates, are constrained by limited available land, driving their investors toward stable countries like the U.S., where an abundance of open land provides potential for such projects. The National Security Factor Concerns about foreign ownership of U.S. agricultural land often focus on nations considered adversarial to the U.S. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Department of Commerce plays a critical role in regulating sensitive technologies, telecommunications and supply chain security as part of national security efforts. In its most recent determination of foreign adversaries, the BIS identified the following governments or foreign non-governmental entities: The People\u2019s Republic of China, Republic of Cuba, Islamic Republic of Iran, Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Russian Federation and Venezuelan politician Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The table below highlights foreign-held acreage associated with investors from five of these nations, excluding North Korea, which holds no U.S. agricultural land. Together, these investors own 370,727 acres, representing three hundredths of 1% (0.03%) of all privately held agricultural land in the U.S. \u2014 roughly the size of an average county in Ohio. From 2022 to 2023, acreage linked to Russian investors declined by 52 acres (-83%), Iranian investors by 1,325 acres (-30%), and Chinese investors by 34,272 acres (-11%), while acreage linked to Venezuelan and Cuban investors remained unchanged.\n\nThere has been significant interest in U.S. agricultural land owned by Chinese investors. In 2023, 277,336 acres were linked to Chinese investors \u2014 0.02% of all privately held U.S. agricultural land. This marks a 106,599-acre (27%) decline from the 2021 peak of 383,935 acres. Figure 6 illustrates trends in Chinese-investor-linked ownership since 2010.\n\nThe increase observed between 2012 and 2013 is primarily tied to the acquisition of a U.S.-based meat processing company, which now accounts for nearly half of all Chinese investor-held acreage. The subsequent decline between 2021 and 2023 stems from two key factors: a reduction in holdings by a Chinese billionaire who had invested in Southwest Texas for a renewable energy project, and the USDA\u2019s reclassification of acreage originally attributed to Chinese investors but later confirmed to be owned by a U.S. land asset management company with operations in Chinese markets. Between 2022 and 2023, Chinese investors held at least 1 acre of agricultural land in 147 counties across the U.S., out of 3,244 total counties and county equivalents. Of these, 38 counties experienced a decline in Chinese investor-owned acreage, with 29 counties seeing a 100% reduction in holdings. Conversely, 10 counties recorded an increase in Chinese investor-owned acreage, while the remaining 99 counties saw no change. Figure 7 illustrates the county locations where Chinese investors owned at least 1 acre during this period, categorized by changes in ownership.",

The United States has also seen an erosion of onshore chipmaking, which now accounts for only about 10 percent of global capacity. Meanwhile, China\u2014the United States\u2019 most formidable strategic competitor\u2014is making rapid strides in semiconductor manufacturing, particularly in defense-related sectors, fueled by massive public subsidies.\n\nIn this context, the United States needs to build on its assets to secure the future of this strategically valuable industry. While we rightly celebrate U.S. leadership in designing chips, we must also recognize the significant value to the nation embedded in Intel Corporation\u2019s deep network of knowledge, resources, and relationships that underpin its ability to produce extremely complex and sensitive technologies that are key to many aspects of the U.S. economy and, not least, national defense. This complex network with a capable U.S. firm at its core took many years to grow and is of major strategic value. Especially given its scale, Intel plays a key role in sustaining the industrial commons that anchor the activities of other semiconductor companies in the United States. Notwithstanding its current challenges, Intel cannot be left unsupported\u2014particularly in today\u2019s fraught geopolitical landscape\u2014as a much-diminished Intel would have major negative consequences for U.S. economic and national security.\n\nThe government recognizes Intel\u2019s strategic importance in the current global competition. Recently, the Department of Commerce awarded Intel Corporation up to $7.9 billion in direct funding. To date, this is the largest share of federal support under the CHIPS Act, although less proportionally compared to the level of its domestic investments. Crucially, though it currently lags behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung in chip process technology, Intel is the only U.S.-headquartered firm within striking distance of regaining U.S. capabilities at advanced process nodes. The company has made massive commitments to invest heavily\u2014more than $100 billion by the end of the decade\u2014in new chipmaking capability and capacity on domestic soil, aiming to develop and manufacture chips at the most advanced process nodes of two nanometers and below.\n\nIntel is thus critical to achieving the CHIPS Act\u2019s economic and strategic goals, it is vital that the company remains viable and capable of carrying out its commitments\u2014with even more public support, if necessary, than it has already been promised. The CHIPS Office at the Department of Commerce must show flexibility to ensure that these national priorities are supported. The United States\u2019 competitors recognize the strategic value of their own champions and have undertaken major efforts to support these assets when deemed necessary, thereby shaping the competitive environment for U.S. firms.\n\nIntel\u2019s Strategic Importance to the CHIPS Act\n\nWhile recent accounts of Intel\u2019s difficulties and leadership changes have been widely reported, the company\u2019s future has broad national and global significance far beyond its employees and shareholders. Intel is a critical player in the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to reduce dependency on chips manufactured abroad\u2014notably the massive concentration of production in Taiwan\u2014and regain parity if not leadership in semiconductor manufacturing technology. Both capability and capacity are needed to provide an alternative source for the most advanced chips. If Intel\u2019s restructuring efforts fail, current U.S. efforts are unlikely to achieve their objectives, with significant ramifications for U.S. national security and economic future.\n\nAs argued by Geoff Colvin in Fortune, Intel is no longer just a conventional company\u2014it\u2019s a \u201ccorporate actor on the geopolitical stage.\u201d Policymakers must recognize Intel\u2019s national security importance within this decade\u2019s dramatically changed geopolitical environment. No other large chip manufacturer is investing anywhere close to the scale of Intel\u2019s projects in the United States over the same time frame. These plans necessarily require very high levels of capital expenditure, with payoffs only coming in the medium-to-long term, a major source of Intel\u2019s current challenges.\n\nIf Intel were to bow out of CHIPS Act initiatives, the act\u2019s successful and timely implementation would be seriously jeopardized. The stakes are high, including for national defense; as writer Mackenzie Hawkins recently pointed out in Bloomberg, \u201cIntel\u2019s woes may . . . jeopardize the government\u2019s ability to reach its policy goals, which include establishing a secure supply of cutting-edge chips for the Pentagon and making a fifth of the world\u2019s advanced processors by 2030.\u201d Finding a U.S.-headquartered replacement to maintain domestic ownership of Intel\u2019s higher-end fabs or to preserve its technological know-how would be nearly impossible.\n\nForeign Support in the Semiconductor Industry\n\nThe cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry means it must make substantial investments to maintain and improve production capacity during economic downturns for the eventual recovery and growth in demand. Semiconductor companies require significant capital to maintain and enhance their production capacity. As Intel\u2019s founder Gordon Moore once remarked, \u201cYou can\u2019t get better with old technology.\u201d To address these high capital needs of the industry, leading manufacturers abroad receive both direct and indirect government support, frequently on a massive scale. This is true across allies and competitors. Government support combined with enormous competence at TSMC has led to the world\u2019s current dependency on Taiwan for the manufacture of the most advanced chips. The United States should recognize this reality and provide substantial, if temporary support to reduce dependency for this critical technology in a country facing unique geopolitical challenges and potential geological risks as well.\n\nMove Now\n\nSuccessful and timely implementation of the CHIPS Act is a critical step to address the China challenge. Meeting the Chip Act\u2019s goals cannot and will not happen without Intel. The United States should understand that Intel is not and will not be competing on the mythical level playing field. Implementing an array of supportive measures beyond the CHIPS Act would be a powerful way to underscore that the government wants Intel, and the U.S. semiconductor industry, to thrive and grow for decades to come.\n\nFull report here: Too Good to Lose: America\u2019s Stake in Intel (November 12, 2024)\n\nRethinking the U.S. Semiconductor Strategy: A Case for Diversification\n\nChristina Alfonso, President, Council on Global Competition and Innovation\n\nThe article, \u201cIntel\u2019s Strategic Importance as a U.S. National Champion,\u201d by Sujai Shivakumar and Charles Wessner makes a compelling case for supporting Intel as a national champion in the U.S. semiconductor industry, particularly in light of the 2022 CHIPS Act. This legislation, designed to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research, has allocated significant funding to key players like Intel. While their arguments highlight important considerations, it is crucial to examine alternative perspectives that could lead to a more robust and resilient semiconductor ecosystem in the United States.\n\nThe Risks of Overreliance\n\nPlacing too much emphasis on a single company, even one as historically significant as Intel, carries inherent risks. An overreliance on Intel could potentially create a monopolistic situation, stifling competition and innovation within the U.S. semiconductor industry. Moreover, if Intel fails to deliver on its promises, the entire U.S. strategy, including the objectives of the CHIPS Act, could be jeopardized, leaving the country vulnerable in a critical technology sector.\n\nThe authors also failed to address Intel\u2019s current financial woes and the impact of subsidies, including whether government funding might contribute to inefficiencies and strategic missteps. This raises an important question: Is relying on firm-level subsidies for a single company the most effective use of taxpayer money?\n\nDiversifying U.S. Semiconductor Capabilities\n\nWhile Intel\u2019s historical importance is undeniable, recent years have seen other U.S.-based companies make significant strides in semiconductor technology. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), for instance, has demonstrated superior efficiency and technological progress in several areas, often surpassing Intel\u2019s offerings. In the server processor market, AMD\u2019s EPYC 9755 128-core Turin processor has shown a 40 percent performance advantage over Intel\u2019s Xeon 6980P Granite Rapids server in a wide variety of server, technical computing, and high-performance computing workloads. This example showcases how AMD has managed to outpace Intel in certain key areas of the semiconductor industry.\n\nGlobalFoundries, while no longer pursuing bleeding-edge nodes, maintains significant manufacturing capabilities on U.S. soil. Their continued production of chips for various applications, including automotive, Internet of Things, and communications, demonstrates the importance of diverse manufacturing capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, innovative startups like Celestial AI, Groq, and SiMa.ai are pushing the boundaries of AI chip design, potentially offering groundbreaking solutions if given proper support. For example, Celestial AI\u2019s development of their \u201cPhotonic Fabric\u201d optical interconnect technology aims to address latency and bandwidth bottlenecks in AI computing, potentially revolutionizing high-performance computing and data center environments.\n\nAllocating substantial taxpayer money to a single company facing challenges may not be the most effective strategy. Instead, distributing funding across multiple firms could stimulate competition and innovation while reducing risks associated with overconcentration.\n\nPolicy Trade-Offs: Firm-Level Subsidies vs. Tax Incentives\n\nA critical policy question is whether firm-level subsidies are the optimal approach compared to broader tax incentives or research and development (R&D) funding. Firm-level subsidies risk fostering dependency or misalignment with market dynamics, while tax incentives could encourage industry-wide growth without favoring specific players.\n\nThe CHIPS Act allocates $39 billion toward manufacturing subsidies but only $11 billion toward R&D initiatives through programs like the National Semiconductor Technology Center. Policymakers should consider whether this balance is appropriate. A stronger focus on R&D could position the United States as a leader in next-generation technologies while avoiding overinvestment in legacy manufacturing capabilities.\n\nInvesting in Future Technologies\n\nRather than solely focusing on catching up in traditional semiconductor manufacturing, the United States could prioritize emerging fields where U.S. companies have the potential to leapfrog current leaders. For example, investing in quantum computing could secure leadership in this transformative field, while neuromorphic chips, which mimic brain function, hold significant promise for AI applications. Similarly, advanced packaging techniques offer opportunities to improve performance without requiring cutting-edge node sizes. By directing more resources toward research and development in these emerging technologies, the United States can leverage its strengths in chip design and specialized processors while fostering long-term competitiveness in the global semiconductor industry.\n\nSupply Chain Resilience\n\nWhile domestic production is essential for national security, achieving supply chain resilience requires collaboration with allied nations. Recent efforts to partner with Japan, South Korea, and European countries demonstrate the potential of such an approach.\n\nRather than attempting to onshore the entire semiconductor manufacturing process, which may not be feasible or economically viable, the United States could focus on securing critical components and technologies through global partnerships. However, this strategy may require adopting a more trade-friendly agenda to ensure access to international expertise and resources.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is vital to U.S. national security and economic competitiveness. While Intel\u2019s historical importance and current efforts should not be discounted, an overreliance on a single company risks undermining broader industry resilience. Policymakers must carefully weigh trade-offs between firm-level subsidies and broader investments in tax incentives or R&D funding.\n\nBy adopting a diversified approach\u2014supporting multiple companies across different segments of the industry while fostering international partnerships\u2014the United States can build a more competitive and resilient semiconductor ecosystem for decades to come. Supporting innovation at every level\u2014from established giants like AMD and GlobalFoundries to promising startups like Celestial AI\u2014will better position the United States as a global leader in this critical sector.",

The listing said the data center team is focused on building \u201creference platforms\u201d based on Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon system-on-chips.\n\nThe server SoC security architect will lead the development of a \u201csystem architecture for confidential computing in data center products,\u201d according to the listing. Confidential computing has become a standard feature in Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC CPUs over the last few years.\n\nQualcomm did not respond to a request for comment by press time.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be Qualcomm\u2019s only effort to sell products in the data center market. Over the past few years, the company has been selling AI accelerator chips under the Qualcomm Cloud AI brand. These chips have been supported by major IT companies such as Amazon Web Services, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s Revitalized CPU Push Started With PCs\n\nKnown best for its Arm-based Snapdragon processors for smartphones, San Diego, Calif.-based Qualcomm last year launched a renewed effort to compete with Intel and AMD in the PC CPU market with its Snapdragon X series of chips.\n\nThe company has been building out a global partner program and organization to enable and incentivize channel partners to sell Snapdragon X-based PCs, CRN has reported.\n\nThe Snapdragon X series is the first product lineup to use the company\u2019s new custom, Arm-based CPU cores, which are based on technology Qualcomm gained from its $1.4 billion acquisition of chip design startup Nuvia in 2021.\n\nWhen Qualcomm announced the Nuvia acquisition, the company said it would use the CPU cores for several product areas, including laptops, smartphones, digital cockpits, advanced driver assistance systems, extended reality and infrastructure networking solutions.\n\nHowever, the company confirmed in a legal filing last year that it also planned to continue developing CPUs for the data center market, as Nuvia originally intended.\n\nThe legal filing was a complaint against Arm, the British chip design licensor that sued Qualcomm and Nuvia in 2023 for allegedly breaching its licensing terms by continuing development of Nuvia\u2019s CPU cores under Qualcomm after the acquisition closed.\n\nThe lawsuit ended in a mistrial in late December because a federal U.S. jury sided with Qualcomm on two key issues but deadlocked on a third. Arm, which sought the halting of sales and destruction of products based on the Nuvia CPU cores, plans to seek a retrial.\n\nQualcomm previously attempted to enter the server CPU market several years ago, but it stepped back from those efforts in 2018, which resulted in layoffs.\n\nThe Qualcomm job listing was first reported by Tom\u2019s Hardware.",

            "content": "Intel Corporation, a technological stalwart in the semiconductor industry, has recently undergone a significant leadership change with the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger ( Reuters ). This move comes amid a period of declining stock performance, with shares dropping approximately 60% over the past three years, and missed opportunities in the rapidly evolving AI sector. While leadership transitions can introduce uncertainty, historical precedents suggest that such changes can rejuvenate a company's strategic direction and enhance shareholder value ( HackerNoon ).\n\nIntel's Historical Context and Recent Challenges\n\nFounded in 1968, Intel has been a pioneer in developing microprocessors, playing a pivotal role in the personal computer revolution. However, in recent years, the company has faced intensified competition from rivals like NVIDIA and AMD, particularly in the AI and data center markets. Under Gelsinger's tenure, which began in February 2021, when the stock price was approximately $55, Intel aimed to regain its technological edge. Despite initiatives such as the introduction of AI chips like Gaudi3 and plans to expand manufacturing capabilities, the company struggled to keep pace with competitors. Notably, Intel's stock price declined by approximately 60% during Gelsinger's leadership, reflecting investor concerns over the company's strategic direction and execution ( Tom's Hardware , CNBC ).\n\nMissed Opportunities in the AI Boom\n\nThe AI industry has experienced exponential growth, with companies like NVIDIA leading the charge through advanced GPU technologies essential for AI computations. Intel's delay in capitalizing on this trend, coupled with its decision to forgo early investments in AI innovators like OpenAI, positioned the company at a disadvantage. In contrast, Microsoft's strategic investment in OpenAI has yielded significant returns, underscoring the importance of timely engagement in emerging technologies ( The Verge ).\n\nParallels with Other Technology Companies After a Notable CEO Departs\n\nSeveral notable examples illustrate how leadership changes have revitalized companies:\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Inc.: Steve Jobs' return to Apple in 1997 marked a turning point for the company. At the time of his departure in 1985, shares were approximately $0.07 (adjusted for stock splits). By late 1998, a year after his return, shares had risen to $0.31, signaling renewed investor confidence ( Investopedia ).\n\n). Starbucks: In 2024, Starbucks experienced a challenging year with declining sales and stock value. The appointment of former Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol brought a strategic shift aimed at simplifying operations and revitalizing the brand. This leadership change boosted investor confidence, resulting in a 24% stock surge ( Barron's ).\n\n). Under Armour: The return of founder Kevin Plank as CEO led to a significant stock surge of 20% following stronger-than-expected earnings, indicating early success from leadership changes ( Barron's ).\n\n). Google (Alphabet): When Sundar Pichai took over as CEO from co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2019, Alphabet underwent a major transformation. Under his leadership, the company expanded into AI and cloud computing, driving stock performance to new highs ( CNBC ).\n\n). IBM: When Ginni Rometty stepped down as CEO and was replaced by Arvind Krishna in 2020, IBM refocused on cloud computing and AI, leading to a significant stock resurgence ( Forbes ).\n\n). Microsoft: The transition from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella in 2014 transformed Microsoft into a cloud-first company, significantly boosting its market value and stock performance ( The Verge ).\n\n). Tesla: When Elon Musk assumed full control of Tesla as CEO, his leadership propelled the company into new markets, securing dominance in electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions, driving stock gains ( Bloomberg ).\n\n). Yahoo: The appointment of Marissa Mayer as CEO in 2012 led to a brief resurgence in Yahoo's stock price, though long-term struggles persisted. Her leadership underscored the impact a high-profile CEO change can have on investor confidence ( The Guardian ).\n\n). Adobe: The transition from Bruce Chizen to Shantanu Narayen in 2007 set the stage for Adobe's successful pivot to a subscription-based business model, fueling long-term stock growth ( Business Insider ).\n\n). Netflix: Reed Hastings' transition to an executive chairman role in 2023 allowed Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters to take over as co-CEOs, maintaining Netflix's industry dominance and stabilizing stock performance ( Hollywood Reporter ).\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel's recent leadership change, prompted by a period of underperformance and missed opportunities in the AI sector, marks a decisive inflection point for the company. Historical precedents from companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Adobe demonstrate that such transitions can drive revitalization and substantial stock appreciation when paired with aggressive strategic realignment.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel's deep-rooted expertise in semiconductor innovation, coupled with its formidable manufacturing infrastructure, provides a strong foundation for resurgence. If the company can successfully leverage AI advancements, expand foundry operations, and capitalize on emerging market demands, it stands to reclaim dominance in a rapidly evolving industry. The leadership shift signals a commitment to transformation, with the potential to position Intel as a frontrunner in next-generation computing and long-term value creation for investors.\n\nAdditional Resource About the Intel CEO Reboot:\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Intel's Battlemage-based Arc B570 GPU has been spotted in the Geekbench OpenCL database days ahead of its official launch.\n\nIntel Arc B570 \"Battlemage\" GPU Performance Leaks Ahead of Launch, This 10 GB GPU is roughly 12% Slower than the Arc B580 For 12% Lower Price\n\nIf you remember, Intel unveiled two GPUs in the Battlemage lineup, featuring the latest Xe2-HPG architecture. The first GPU (Arc B580) was already launched in December 2024, but the lower-priced variant is about to launch in a few days. Intel announced that the Arc B570 will launch officially on 15th January and there are just two days left before we can see how the card performs.\n\nSince leaks usually emerge a few days before launch, we have one of the first benchmarks for this GPU. The user @GawroskiT spotted the GPU on Geekbench, showing its prowess in the OpenCL test. If you don't know about Geekbench, it's a tool that users usually use for benchmarking their CPUs and GPUs and can vary from test to test. Hence, keep in mind that the scores yielded by Arc B570 may come to be higher or even lower with more benchmarks.\n\nNonetheless, we can see that the Intel Arc B570 \"Battlemage\" GPU is noticeably slower than the Arc B580 as expected.\n\nThe Arc B570 scored 86716 points in OpenCL, which, when compared to the OpenCL score of B580, is roughly 12% slower depending on which result you pick up for comparison. The B580 usually hovers between 95,000-100,000 points and if we take one of the recent scores of the B580 (98343 points), the B570 is around 12% slower.\n\nGeekbench 6 (OpenCL) Score 0 16956 33912 50868 67824 84780 101736 0 16956 33912 50868 67824 84780 101736 RTX 4060 101732 Arc B580 98343 Arc B570 86716 RX 7600 XT 83918\n\nPlus, we can see the specs listed in the OpenCL Information tab, revealing 144 Compute Units and up to 2.75 GHz of boost clock. While the official information does reveal the base of a 2500 MHz clock, we have seen the 2.75 GHz boost for the first time, which is probably due to being a custom AIB edition.\n\nThe Intel Arc B570 GPU boasts 10 GB GDDR6 memory on a 160-bit bus, which was already revealed earlier, and the detailed specifications can be found on Intel's official website. The GPU does use the same BMG-G21 die that measures 272 mm2 but has cut-down specs. The Arc B570 is expected to be a bit slower than the B580 in gaming as well, but we don't know if there is a 10-15% performance gap there too.\n\nThe Intel Arc B570 will be launched for $219 for the limited edition, but the custom designs from Intel's board partners will retail for higher. For the price, the Intel Arc B580 may still seem like the better value, but we will see how things pan out for this new mainstream offering. The B580 is a very strong mainstream card and, hopefully, we will see some high-end offerings in the future as the company has reaffirmed support of the discrete segment for the foreseeable future.\n\nIntel Arc Battlemage GPU Lineup\n\nGPU Name Arc B580 Arc B570 Family Battlemage B-Series Battlemage B-Series Process TSMC 5nm TSMC 5nm Die 272mm2 272mm2 Transistors 19.6 Million 19.6 Million Cores 20 Xe2 18 Xe2 RT Units 20 RTU 18 RTU XMX Engines 160 144 Clock Speed 2670 MHz 2500 MHz VRAM 12 GB GDDR6 10 GB GDDR6 Memory Bus 192-bit 160-bit Bandwidth 456 GB/s 380 GB/s TBP 190W 150W Connector 1x 8-Pin 1x 8-Pin Interface PCIe 4.0 x8 PCIe 4.0 x8 Price $249 $219 Launch 13th December 2024 16th January 2025\n\nNews Source: Benchleaks",

            "content": "As things heated up with Mike Vrabel following Jerod Mayo\u2019s firing last Sunday night, one of the discussions around Patriots ownership moving as quickly as they did centered around the fact Vrabel was already taking interviews elsewhere.\n\nSome of the theories were that Vrabel, who interviewed with the New York Jets ahead of his meeting with New England this past week, was done with the intent of trying to put pressure on Robert and Jonathan Kraft to hire the former Patriots linebacker. Many believed that was why Robert Kraft was moving \u201cfast,\u201d something he told everyone they had planned on doing last week.\n\nPhil Perry of NBC Sports Boston pointed out last week in a segment discussing Vrabel \u2013 and Vrabel\u2019s former teammate, Ted Johnson, agreed \u2013 that the interview with the Jets may have been Vrabel \u201cshaking his tailfeathers\u201d to try and motivate the club to make the move, showing that he was willing to explore his options and potentially sign elsewhere.\n\nAccording to the Boston Sports Journal\u2019s Greg Bedard, that may not have been the case. It sounds like Vrabel might have instead had a different motive behind sitting down with the Jets.\n\nBedard said on Sunday during a podcast with John Zannis that he heard that the move was made knowing full well he\u2019d be in New England, with the former linebacker instead looking to learn a little more about what is now a team he\u2019ll face twice a season in the coming years.\n\n\u201cRelated to Vrabel and the timeline, there\u2019s a rumor in NFL circles, and again, this is just a rumor,\u201d said Bedard. \u201cThere\u2019s a rumor in NFL circles that Vrabel didn\u2019t take the Jets interview to pressure the Krafts. He did it to go and get background research on the Jets, having an idea that he might be the next Patriots head coach. I just think that\u2019s interesting.\u201d\n\nIt is interesting, and it\u2019s somewhat of a Belichickian move, given that Vrabel got to sit down with Jets ownership and hear about how they plan to improve their team coming off of what was their own dysfunctional disaster in 2024. It also provides Vrabel with a little intel into their mindset, which could certainly come in handy as New England reworks its roster this offseason.\n\nMeanwhile, it adds a little fuel to the fire after Rex Ryan, who also recently interviewed with the Jets, said during a broadcast on Sunday that he\u2019s hoping to land the job with New York, which would give him an opportunity to face off against Vrabel.\n\nRyan is already trying to restart the border war between the two teams, although his future remains uncertain as the Jets continue exploring their options.\n\n\u201cHopefully, I get to kick this guy\u2019s a** twice a year,\u201d said Ryan, laughing while adding, \u201cMy team, not me personally.\u201d\n\nRyan said recently during an appearance on the DiPietro & Rothenberg Show that he expects to get the job, simply because he feels he\u2019s the best candidate.\n\n\u201cThe reason I think I\u2019m going to get it is because I\u2019m the best guy for it. It ain\u2019t close,\u201d said Ryan via Rich Cimini of ESPN.com. \u201cThe thing you have to do is, you have to connect with your football team, you have to connect with your fan base. The way they play, that\u2019s the most important thing. It\u2019s not just the Xs and Os and all that. This Ben Johnson, I love him, I absolutely love him, but I\u2019m a better candidate for this job than he would be.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see if the Jets ultimately pull the trigger there. But either way, Vrabel is already starting things off playing chess against an organization that certainly remains a mess heading into 2024.\n\nRelated\n\nAbout Ian Logue Ian Logue is a Seacoast native and owner and senior writer for PatsFans.com, an independent media site covering the New England Patriots and has been running this site in one form or another since 1997.\n\nMore Patriots News Headlines:",

            "content": "One area where Intel (INTC 1.37%) has seriously dropped the ball has been artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia essentially owns the market for AI accelerator chips, and AMD is at least competitive with its Instinct line of data center graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia is generating tens of billions of dollars in revenue each quarter from its data center GPUs, and AMD is producing a few billion per year. Meanwhile, Intel fell short of its goal to sell $500 million worth of AI accelerators in 2024.\n\nMissing the boat\n\nIt didn't have to be this way, but mistakes made long ago have hampered Intel's AI efforts. The company was working on a discrete GPU project, codenamed Larabee, way back in 2008, and its architecture would have been well suited for the massively parallel computing tasks required to train AI models. Larabee was canceled, however, setting the stage for Intel to be blindsided by the AI revolution and the surge in demand for GPU accelerators over the past few years.\n\nIntel's current AI accelerator lineup comes from Habana Labs, an AI chip company Intel acquired in 2019. The Gaudi family of AI chips aren't traditional GPUs, although they're similar in nature.\n\nThe latest Gaudi 3 chip offers solid performance, and Intel has been aggressive on pricing. Gaudi could have been a success story for Intel, but an immature software ecosystem is hurting sales. Developers who have been working with GPUs for years don't have experience with Gaudi's distinct architecture, something that's been impossible for Intel to overcome.\n\nSoftware immaturity is starting to become a theme for Intel in the graphics and AI spaces. In 2023, the company tried again in the discrete GPU market with its Arc Alchemist gaming graphics cards, but they failed to sell well due to faulty software drivers and myriad game-breaking bugs. The company has stuck with it, greatly improving its software over time, and its second-generation graphics cards are faring much better.\n\nDon't expect big things in 2025\n\nIf Intel's experience in the graphics card business is any indication, it's going to take time for the AI software ecosystem to improve enough for Gaudi to be a major success. Another wrinkle is that Intel's AI accelerator roadmap is complicated. Under the Max brand name, Intel already sells data center GPUs, which power the Aurora supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory.\n\nNeither the Max family of GPUs nor the Gaudi family of AI accelerators will be extended. Rather, the next-generation Falcon Shores will be a traditional GPU that will reportedly integrate some of Gaudi's unique features.\n\nFalcon Shores is expected to launch by the end of 2025, although there are no guarantees given Intel's current turmoil. Gaudi 3 sales should ramp up this year compared to last year, but given the software issues, sales are unlikely to be anywhere close to what AMD is raking in with its data center GPUs.\n\nIntel has had some successes, although they've been few and far between. One major win was a deal with IBM to put Gaudi 3 chips in IBM's cloud data centers and integrate them into IBM's watsonx AI platform. That should help boost Gaudi sales this year, although the size of the deal hasn't been disclosed.\n\nA bigger AI opportunity\n\nIntel may eventually find success selling data center GPUs that double as AI accelerators, but it's probably not going to happen this year. In the long run, manufacturing AI accelerators for other companies may prove to be a more lucrative endeavor.\n\nIntel is betting big on leveraging its decades of manufacturing expertise and tens of billions of dollars in manufacturing investments to build a viable foundry business. The company is on the cusp of completing its initial process roadmap, with the Intel 18A process scheduled to go into volume production next year. Intel will make some of its own central processing units (CPUs) on Intel 18A, and it's already won a few high-profile customers.\n\nThose customers include Microsoft, which will use Intel 18A to produce an undisclosed chip, and Amazon, which will tap Intel 18A for an AI fabric chip. If Intel can prove to potential customers that Intel 18A is the real deal by successfully making its own chips and making chips as part of these early partnerships, more AI-related chips could be running through Intel's foundries in 2026 and beyond.\n\nLong story short, Intel's AI accelerator revenue probably won't be all that impressive in 2025 as the company works through software issues and solidifies its roadmap. However, looking further ahead, the foundry business may ultimately be a larger opportunity for Intel to scoop up some AI spending.",

A Chinese user, \"wytiwx\", has pushed the Intel i9-14900KF past 9.12 GHz, officially seizing the crown from Elmor. Fun fact: HWBot's data shows that, to date, Elmor has been the only person to breach the 9 GHz territory, but not anymore.\n\nThe test bench that enabled this feat is powered by the i9-14900KF with all E-cores disabled and hyperthreading turned off. The setup was paired with the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Apex and 16GB of DDR5 memory. The overclocker opted for the Windows 7 (6.1) Operating System which is surely an interesting choice.\n\nNormally, the i9-14900KF wields an iGPU-less configuration with 24 cores (eight P and sixteen E) and 32 threads with an out-of-the-box turbo clock of 6 GHz. This processor stands as Intel's fastest gaming CPU; only to be dethroned by AMD's top X3D counterparts. These X3D CPUs have been the Achilles' heel for Intel, though Team Blue actually has an answer to AMD's V-Cache technology; just not for consumers.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: SkatterBencher (Image credit: CPU-Z\n\nWith a core voltage of 1.387V and likely under Liquid Nitrogen or Helium, the i9-14900KF managed to hit 9.121 GHz, dethroning the previous world record by the thinnest of margins at just 4 MHz. So, it probably won't be long until Elmor steps in to reclaim his crown. While the i9-14900KS might seem like the go-to for overclocking, it is essentially just a better-binned variant of the i9-14900K.\n\nThe Raptor Lake lineup, excluding the degradation fiasco, was Intel's first series to supersede AMD's Piledriver FX-8350 after 12 years. Again, these record-breaking overclocks are impressive but not indicative of how silicon performs in the real world since they involve exotic cooling solutions and extreme settings.\n\nThat said, Arrow Lake also has decent overclocking potential when it comes to memory. The newer process node and disaggregated layout might limit peak core clock potentials, but that's a tradeoff for better efficiency. Nonetheless, 25 years ago, Intel said we'd have 10 GHz CPUs by 2005... Frequency isn't the be-all and end-all of CPU performance but that same 10 GHz barrier will be the next major milestone for the overclocking community.",

President-elect Donald Trump, who is supported by business leaders like Elon Musk, may influence AI policies, with Musk\u2019s experience in AI raising expectations for U.S. advancements. In Europe, the EU\u2019s AI Act has introduced comprehensive regulations, but tensions with U.S. tech companies are still there over its strict measures.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.K. is considering a more flexible, principles-based approach, especially regarding the use of copyrighted content for AI training.

Companies are rapidly building out AI infrastructure, with an increasing focus on supply chain components beyond just semiconductors, which highlight potential profits in sectors like memory, cooling, and fiber optics.\n\nJon McNeill, co-founder of Vistashares, discussed the impact of AI infrastructure on investment opportunities in an interview with Romaine Bostick and Scarlet Fu of Bloomberg. He explained that while AI\u2019s impact on data centers is often discussed in terms of semiconductors, the actual supply chain involves different elements, such as memory, cooling, and fiber optics. McNeill emphasized the potential for profits in the AI supply chain, especially for investors looking beyond the major producers to lesser-known companies.\n\nHe also addressed the risks of international investments and noted that while the U.S. dominates the AI sector, Asia is rapidly building its own AI infrastructure. McNeill highlighted the growing value of AI applications in autonomous driving and robotics, which could drive significant economic growth. He pointed to large investments in data centers, such as AWS\u2019 $11 billion investment in Georgia, as signs that this growth will continue, with the major tech companies leading the charge in the AI race.",

Eitan Paz was alerted at around 4:00 a.m. by Brig.-Gen. Avi Rosenfeld, commander of the Gaza Division \u2013 not by Military Intelligence or the Operations Directorate.\n\nRosenfeld\u2019s call warned of unusual activity in Gaza but provided no concrete details.

IDF soldiers operating near the Zikim beach area, October 29, 2023. (credit: IDF SPOKESPERSON'S UNIT)\n\nAt the time of the attack, seven boats \u2013 possibly more \u2013 were prepared for the operation, each carrying dozens of terrorists. Fearing that a significant incident was unfolding, Paz raised the base\u2019s alert level and called in commanders from their homes despite directives to avoid alerting Hamas to Israeli awareness.\n\nThis preemptive measure led to the interception of five of the seven boats attempting to reach Israeli shores. However, the scale of the attack was devastating.\n\nHow the raid unfolded\n\nFootage uncovered during the inquiry shows the actions of ground forces who arrived at Zikim Beach in a \u201cSavannah\u201d vehicle. During the confrontation, the vehicle was abandoned, allowing terrorists to seize it and drive toward Zikim.\n\nThey encountered security personnel and members of the rapid response team, who opened fire but were forced to retreat. In the midst of the skirmish, one soldier called the Ashdod base operations room, reporting the raid and requesting immediate evacuation for seven soldiers stranded in the area.\n\nThroughout the investigation, navy officials emphasized that they responded with all available resources during a surprise attack for which they had no prior warning. They highlighted that five boats were intercepted and called for the permanent deployment of Shayetet 13 or another elite combat unit to secure the coastal area near the Gaza border.\n\n\u201cThe matter is being examined as part of the investigations into October 7,\u201d the IDF Spokesperson\u2019s Unit said. \u201cThe IDF is in the midst of the investigation process, and the findings will be made public once concluded.\u201d\n\nA senior military official added: \u201cThe navy had thoroughly studied the Nukhba naval unit. On that morning, no warning was issued regarding the raid.\u201d",

            "content": "TL;DR: If you're planning to pick up one of Intel's new non-overclockable (non-K series) Core Ultra 200-series desktop processors, you'll be getting a revamped stock CPU cooler included in the package. To complement the launch of its Core Ultra 200 chips, Intel has introduced updated versions of its Laminar cooler lineup.\n\nWhile stock coolers tend to be fairly basic and underpowered affairs, Intel claims these new models offer some legitimate performance uplifts and aesthetic improvements over their predecessors.\n\nLeading the pack is the Laminar RH2, which comes bundled with Intel's Core Ultra 9 285. This cooler features an aluminum heatsink coupled with a copper base plate for improved heat transfer. Intel says it's rated for up to 65W TDP chips and touts \"near-silent\" operation at just 2.2 bels of sound power output.\n\nIn addition to the performance promises, the RH2 gets some fresh style with integrated ARGB lighting in the form of an illuminated ring around the top.\n\nIntel Core Ultra (Series 2) Cooler\n\nLaminar RH2 / Laminar RM2 pic.twitter.com/N3EJc8UVWR \u2013 188\u53f7 (@momomo_us) January 7, 2025\n\nFor users opting for one of the more affordable Core Ultra 5 models \u2013 such as the 225, 235, or 265 \u2013 you'll find the Laminar RM2 inside the box. This downsized variant foregoes the ARGB lighting and has a slightly louder noise rating of 3.6 bels. However, it retains the important copper base plate upgrade over its predecessor, the RM1.\n\nIn terms of real-world performance, Intel's figures indicate that the RH2 operates at a reasonably quiet 23 decibels under load, while the RM2 produces slightly more noise at 30 decibels.\n\nIt's worth reiterating that these coolers are designed solely with stock, non-overclocked performance in mind. If you're looking to push your new Ultra chip to its limits with some heavy manual tuning, you'll need to spring for a bigger third-party air or liquid cooler.\n\nHowever, for the majority of users running their systems at standard clock speeds and power limits, the Laminar RH2 and RM2 offer a welcome upgrade over Intel's previous stock cooling solutions. The addition of a copper contact plate improves heat dissipation efficiency, and when paired with the updated designs, these coolers may provide a slightly cooler and quieter desktop experience right out of the box.",

            "content": "Intel's Arrow Lake processors are all the hype these days, but the chipmaker has been rumored to work on a new P-core-only lineup for consumers, codenamed \"Bartlett Lake.\" The first wave of these chips launched at CES, though in a hybrid configuration and exclusively for embedded devices through OEMs. Congatec's latest modules bundle these processors in a 120 x 160mm COM-HPC Client Size C package for high-performance computing in a small form factor.\n\nThese new Core 200 Bartlett Lake-S processors boast up to 24 cores in a hybrid configuration employing Alder Lake/Raptor Lake silicon under the hood. Congatec's new modules are configurable with three SKUs: Core 3 201E, Core 5 211E, and Core 7 251E. Don't expect major changes apart from a few add-ons, such as ECC memory on select products. In terms of memory, these modules host four SODIMM sockets for up to 128GB of DDR5-4000 memory.\n\nThese devices come pre-loaded with Linux-based operating systems like ctrlX OS, Ubuntu, and RT-Linux. For even faster time-to-market, congatec allows you to include custom applications for an almost seamless transition. Developers can mount these COMs on congatec's mATX (Micro-ATX) carrier boards, offering a fully functional computer system. In addition, we can find Intel's R680E and Q670E chipsets onboard alongside two 2.5 GbE ports. These modules are tailor-designed for medical imaging, networking, edge computing, banking applications, you name it.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Processor Cores/Threads P-Cores/E-Cores P-Core Clocks E-Core Clocks Execution Units TDP Core 7 251E 24/32 8 + 16 2.1 GHz Base / 5.6 GHz Boost 1.6 GHz Base / 4.4 GHz Boost 32 65W Core 5 211E 10/16 6 + 4 2.7 GHz Base / 4.9 GHz Boost 2.0 GHz Base / 3.7 GHz Boost 24 65W Core 3 201E 4/8 4 + 0 3.6 GHz Base / 4.8 GHz Boost N/A 24 65W\n\nThe Core 7 251E wields a layout similar to the i9-13900 with 24 cores and a boost clock of 5.6 GHz. Notably, all CPUs are configured with a 65W TDP due to their embedded nature. Ten and four cores, respectively, follow the Core 5 211E and Core 3 201E. Intel claims the Core 7 251E is around 6% and 8% faster than the i7-14700 (20 cores with a 5.4 GHz boost clock) in single-core and multi-core performance.\n\nSo where is the P-core-only Bartlett Lake-S? Rumors suggest that these processors are slated for Q3 2025, with the Core 9 SKUs allegedly offering 12 full-fat performance. Similar to their predecessors, these CPUs should employ Raptor Cove P-cores, so there won't be major improvements in IPC or efficiency.\n\nNonetheless, will LGA1700 have the same legacy as AM4? It's hard to say, especially considering the FUD surrounding Intel's recent degradation fiasco. Still, Bartlett Lake-S seems an interesting choice if you don't want to splurge cash on a new motherboard and fast DDR5 memory. Plus, Intel hasn't precisely commented on the longevity of LGA1851, but let's hope the platform sees at least one more generation.",

            "content": "Intel's Arc B580 graphics card was meant to be a massive hit among mainstream PC gamers, offering excellent value at $250. So much so that we even hailed it as the best value GPU in our day-one review published a month ago. However, as reports began to surface indicating that the graphics card's impressive performance was limited to newer CPUs, we knew it was time for a retest.\n\nWe've gathered a ton of new benchmark data for you, some of this was already explored briefly on YouTube, diving into the B580's overhead issues that cause performance to suffer in CPU-limited gaming scenarios. Our testing revealed that the Arc B580 performed significantly worse than the RTX 4060 in games like Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 when paired with either a Ryzen 7 9800X3D or a Ryzen 5 2600. With the latter, average frame rates dropped to just 31 FPS, while 1% lows dipped to 25 FPS \u2013 making the game nearly unplayable.\n\nThat said, the issues appeared to be limited to some titles. In many other games, the Arc B580's performance aligned with expectations. For instance, it delivers playable frame rates in games like Alan Wake 2, Doom Eternal, Horizon: Forbidden West, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 when paired with an older Core i5-9600K chip.\n\nIt's important to note that all Arc graphics cards require ReBAR and Smart Access Memory (SAM) support. For this reason, Intel recommends using 10th-gen Core CPUs or newer, or AMD Ryzen 3000 series CPUs or newer. However, in our tests, ReBAR was backported and enabled on the systems, suggesting the issue lies elsewhere.\n\nTest System Specs\n\nUpon realizing that the Arc B580 doesn't perform as well with a slower CPU, such as the Ryzen 5 5600, it became obvious that a re-review was in order. To address this, we've added Ryzen 5 5600 results to our original Arc B580 review data.\n\nThis updated analysis includes not just the Intel B580, but also the RTX 4060, Radeon 7600, and Radeon 7600 XT. All of these GPUs were retested using the Ryzen 5 5600, allowing us to compare this data to the original results gathered with the 9800X3D.\n\nCPU AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 5600 Motherboard Gigabyte X670E Master\n\n(BIOS F33f - ReBAR enabled)\n\nMSI MPG X570S Carbon MAX WiFi\n\n(BIOS 7D52v1B1 - ReBAR enabled) Memory G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6000\n\n[CL30-38-38-96]\n\nG.Skill Ripjaws V Series 32GB DDR4-3600\n\n[CL14-15-15-35] ATX Case Antec Flux Pro Power Supply Kolink Regulator Gold ATX 3.0 1200W Storage TeamGroup T-Force A440 M.2\n\nPCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD 4TB Operating System Windows 11 24H2 Display Driver Nvidia GeForce Game Ready 566.14 WHQL\n\nAMD Radeon Adrenalin 24.12.1\n\nIntel Arc 32.0.101.6449_101.6256 WHQL Certified\n\nOn top of that, we spent several days collecting a fresh set of results using the same 12 games. This time, we tested with lower-quality presets \u2013 mostly medium settings \u2013 and also compiled a 1440p quality upscaling data set. These results are particularly interesting, and we'll delve into them after reviewing the initial re-review data. Let's get into it\u2026\n\nGaming Benchmarks\n\nThe good news is that the performance issue is likely to occur only in very CPU-demanding games, and thankfully, that is indeed the case. We will skip over many examples where performance or scaling remains unchanged when using the Ryzen 5 5600, but here are a few notable cases.\n\nA Plague Tale Requiem\n\nTesting with A Plague Tale: Requiem shows a minor performance decline for the B580 at 1080p \u2013 3% for the average frame rate and 8% for the 1% lows. The hit to the 1% lows is slightly concerning, as the RX 7600 and RTX 4060 saw no such decline, but since they were slower to begin with, it's not a major issue. At 1440p, the B580 remains much faster than its GeForce and Radeon competitors and shows no performance impact with the 5600, which is an excellent result.\n\nDragon Age\n\nFor Dragon Age, there was no performance hit at all. The B580 delivered identical performance using either the Ryzen 5 5600 or Ryzen 7 7800X3D, and this was true at both 1080p and 1440p.\n\nDying Light 2\n\nIn Dying Light 2, performance dropped only slightly, with a 4% decrease in the average frame rate and an 8% reduction in 1% lows when pairing the B580 with the 5600. While not massive, this is less than ideal, especially given that Radeon and GeForce GPUs experienced no performance loss.\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor showed no performance difference when running the B580 on the 5600 compared to the 9800X3D. This might not hold true for all areas of the game, but in the section used for GPU testing, the results were consistent.\n\nThe Last of Us Part I\n\nThe performance in The Last of Us Part I is more concerning. Previously, with the 9800X3D, the B580 averaged 75 FPS at 1080p. However, with the slower 5600, this dropped to 53 FPS \u2013 a significant 29% reduction. Although slower CPUs can reduce frame rates, the alarming part is that the RTX 4060 experienced only a 6% drop, and the RX 7600 just 5%. At 1440p, this issue appears to resolve itself, as the lower frame rates reduce the CPU bottleneck. However, enabling upscaling might bring back the problem, something we'll explore shortly.\n\nStarfield\n\nStarfield already suffered from poor performance on the Arc GPUs, with severe frame-time issues. A further 10% reduction when using the 5600 is unfortunate, but given the baseline performance was already poor, not much is lost here.\n\nWar Thunder\n\nThe War Thunder results in DirectX 11 mode are eye-opening. Using the 9800X3D, the B580 achieved an impressive 255 FPS. Switching to the Ryzen 5 5600 dropped this to 155 FPS \u2013 a massive 39% decrease. Interestingly, the Radeon GPUs also saw substantial declines (e.g., 36% for the RX 7600), but the RTX 4060 experienced only a 5% drop in average frame rate, although its 1% lows were hit by 20%.\n\nHistorically, Radeon GPUs have shown overhead issues with older APIs like DX11 and DX10, while GeForce GPUs have generally performed well with DX11, albeit sometimes struggling with DX12 titles. Even at 1440p, the B580 and Radeon GPUs exhibited declines with the 5600, while the RTX 4060 remained unaffected.\n\nCyberpunk 2077\n\nIn Cyberpunk 2077, the B580 struggled when paired with the 5600, with the average frame rate dropping by 18% and 1% lows by 24%. The 1% lows were already low with the 9800X3D, making this decline more noticeable. Radeon and GeForce GPUs, however, showed no performance impact. At 1440p, the problem seems to diminish due to the lower frame rates, but enabling upscaling would likely bring it back \u2013 something we'll investigate soon.\n\nHogwarts Legacy\n\nThe B580 also faltered in Hogwarts Legacy when using the 5600. The 1% lows suffered a 38% decline, while the RTX 4060 saw an 18% drop. At 1440p, the B580 appeared to recover, but this was likely due to reduced CPU load from lower frame rates.\n\nStar Wars Outlaws\n\nIn Star Wars Outlaws, the B580 dropped from 40 FPS with the 9800X3D to 34 FPS with the 5600 \u2013 a 15% decline. Meanwhile, the RX 7600 and RTX 4060 showed no performance loss.\n\nSpace Marine 2\n\nIn Space Marine 2, the B580's average frame rate dropped from 62 FPS with the 9800X3D to 53 FPS with the 5600 \u2013 a 15% decrease. Similar to War Thunder, the RTX 4060 exhibited minimal performance loss, while Radeon GPUs like the RX 7600 saw more substantial declines, such as a 17% drop with the 5600.\n\nSpider-Man Remastered\n\nSpider-Man Remastered was particularly problematic for the B580. At 1080p, performance dropped by a staggering 50%, while the RTX 4060 saw only a 13% reduction and the RX 7600 just 5%. These issues persisted for the B580 even at 1440p.\n\n12 Game Performance Average\n\nHere's a look at the 12-game average data, and the results look concerning for the B580. It shows an 18% performance reduction when paired with a slower CPU. This is particularly disappointing, as the RTX 4060 only saw a 4% drop, and the RX 7600 just a 6% drop.\n\nEssentially, the B580 goes from being faster than both the RTX 4060 and RX 7600 when paired with the 9800X3D to noticeably slower than both when paired with the Ryzen 5 5600.\n\nThe performance hit at 1440p is significantly lower, as the lower frame rates reduce the impact of the CPU bottleneck. Here, the B580 experiences just a 9% drop. However, this is still worse than the RX 7600, which saw a 4% reduction, and the RTX 4060, which experienced no performance drop at all.\n\nFor context, when using the 9800X3D, the B580 was 14% faster than the 4060, but with both GPUs paired to the Ryzen 5 5600, the B580 is only 4% faster. This shift has a noticeable impact on the value proposition of the B580.\n\nCost Per Frame\n\nLooking at the updated cost-per-frame graph, the Intel Arc B580 is now 17% better value than the Radeon RX 7600, compared to 21% previously. While this isn't a dramatic shift, it's important to note that this comparison uses the more favorable 1440p data, which largely masks the B580's overhead issues.\n\nWith that in mind, let's move on to a more compelling and real-world data set.\n\nThe Big Re-Test: Medium Quality 1440p Upscaling Comparison\n\nThe following data set could easily stand alone as its own article, given the scope of the testing involved. However, our goal is to make this re-review as comprehensive as possible, so let's dive in. For this analysis, we've tested the Arc B580, RTX 4060, and RX 7600 using both the 9800X3D and Ryzen 5 5600 at 1080p, 1440p, and 1440p with quality upscaling across all 12 games.\n\nMedium: Star Wars Jedi: Survivor\n\nFirst, we have Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, tested using the medium quality preset. With the 9800X3D, the B580 achieves an average of 97 FPS, dropping slightly to 89 FPS with the 5600. This appears to be a typical CPU bottleneck, and as previously observed, this title doesn't seem to present specific issues for the B580, at least in the area we tested.\n\nAt 1440p, some interesting trends emerge. At native 1440p, the B580 outperforms the RX 7600 and RTX 4060 regardless of the CPU used. However, when enabling quality upscaling at 1440p, we see higher frame rates than at native 1080p. As a result, the Radeon and GeForce GPUs are able to match the B580, delivering around 90 FPS with the Ryzen 5 5600.\n\nMedium: A Plague Tale: Requiem\n\nUsing the medium preset, A Plague Tale: Requiem reveals some interesting results. When paired with the 9800X3D, the B580 performs impressively, beating the RTX 4060 by a 16% margin at 1080p. However, when paired with the Ryzen 5 5600, the B580 falls 2% behind in average frame rate and 11% in 1% lows.\n\nAt 1440p, the scenario changes for a few reasons. First, the RTX 4060 and RX 7600 can no longer achieve 60 FPS, causing their performance to drop. Meanwhile, the B580 hits 71 FPS on the 5600, remaining below the CPU cap but still outperforming the RTX 4060 by 27%, a significant advantage.\n\nHowever, enabling the resolution optimizer \u2013 since this title doesn't support FSR or XeSS \u2013 dramatically boosts the B580's frame rate to 113 FPS with the 9800X3D, making it 66% faster than the RTX 4060. When using the 5600, the B580 caps at 80 FPS, which is 18% faster than the RTX 4060. While still an impressive result, it's less remarkable compared to what we initially observed with the 9800X3D.\n\nMedium: Cyberpunk 2077\n\nTesting Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty with the medium preset significantly reduces CPU load due to the crowd density being lowered from \"high\" to \"low.\" This benefits the B580, which now performs well at 1080p, even when paired with the Ryzen 5 5600.\n\nAt 1440p, the B580 looks even better. However, enabling quality upscaling reduces its margin. To further analyze, we manually adjusted the crowd density back to \"high\" while keeping the other medium preset settings unchanged.\n\nMedium: Cyberpunk 2077 (High Crowd)\n\nWith the higher crowd density, the B580's performance changes significantly, particularly when using the Ryzen 5 5600. Previously achieving 99 FPS, the frame rate drops to 82 FPS under the increased CPU load. In contrast, the Radeon and GeForce GPUs show virtually no change in performance.\n\nAt 1440p, the additional CPU load reduces the B580's advantage. While it was 17% faster than the RTX 4060 with the 9800X3D, it's now only 5% faster with the 5600. Enabling quality upscaling pushes the RTX 4060 ahead of the B580, with the latter suffering a 20% drop in 1% lows.\n\nMedium: Dying Light 2\n\nNo significant issues were observed for the B580 in Dying Light 2 Stay Human when using the high preset, and this remains true with the medium preset. The B580 outperforms both the RTX 4060 and RX 7600, even when paired with the Ryzen 5 5600. At 1440p, this trend continues, even with upscaling enabled.\n\nMedium: Dragon Age: The Veilguard\n\nIn Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the B580 lags slightly at 1080p, but this isn't due to CPU limitations, as both the 9800X3D and 5600 produce identical results. At 1440p, the B580 experiences a smaller performance drop compared to its competitors, allowing it to match the RTX 4060. However, it falls slightly behind with upscaling enabled. Overall, the results for the B580 appear reasonable.\n\nMedium: Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered\n\nAs seen in earlier testing, Spider-Man Remastered is a challenging title for the B580. Dropping from the \"very high\" preset to \"high,\" the B580 delivers 160 FPS with the 9800X3D, outperforming the RTX 4060 by 13% in average frame rate and 42% over the RX 7600.\n\nSwitching to the Ryzen 5 5600, the B580's performance drops to 82 FPS. While still playable, this represents a 26% deficit compared to the RTX 4060 and a 20% deficit compared to the RX 7600.\n\nAt 1440p, the B580 continues to excel with the 9800X3D but only matches the RX 7600 when paired with the 5600, making it 16% slower than the RTX 4060. With upscaling enabled, the B580's performance worsens further, becoming 27% slower than the RTX 4060 and 21% slower than the RX 7600. Although the performance is still playable, the reduced value is concerning.\n\nMedium: Hogwarts Legacy\n\nIn Hogwarts Legacy, the B580 previously matched the RTX 4060 at 1080p with the high preset and the 9800X3D. However, with the older medium preset, the B580 falls behind, limiting performance to 106 FPS, which, while excellent overall, impacts its value.\n\nAt native 1440p, the B580 matches the RX 7600 and slightly outpaces the RTX 4060 when using either CPU. However, enabling upscaling significantly impacts the B580's performance, as its overhead becomes a bottleneck.\n\nMedium: Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2\n\nIn Space Marine 2, using the ultra preset, the B580 struggled, and dialing down to medium only improves performance slightly. With the 9800X3D, the frame rate increases by 6%, reaching 66 FPS, and by 8% with the 5600. However, the Radeon and GeForce GPUs remain much faster, regardless of CPU.\n\nAt 1440p, performance with the medium preset mirrors the ultra preset, and the B580 fares poorly when paired with the 5600. With upscaling at 1440p, the B580 is 25% slower than the RTX 4060. Interestingly, the RX 7600 also experiences a 10% performance drop with the 5600, whereas the RTX 4060 remains unaffected.\n\nMedium: The Last of Us Part I\n\nSwitching to the medium preset, The Last of Us Part I shows strong performance from the B580 when paired with the 9800X3D, achieving 120 FPS on average. With the 5600, performance remains good, though 1% lows slip slightly.\n\nAt native 1440p, the B580 dominates, outpacing the RTX 4060 and RX 7600 by a wide margin, rendering over 80 FPS compared to around 60 FPS for the other GPUs. However, with upscaling, the B580 gains little due to overhead limitations, even with the 9800X3D. As a result, the RX 7600 and RTX 4060 close the gap, offering similar performance with the 5600.\n\nMedium: Star Wars Outlaws\n\nResults for Star Wars Outlaws are fairly typical. The B580 performs well, even with the Ryzen 5 5600. At native 1440p, the B580 outpaces both the RTX 4060 and RX 7600. However, enabling upscaling allows the RTX 4060 to pull ahead, as it sees a 59% performance boost compared to 36% for the B580 and 34% for the RX 7600.\n\nMedium: Starfield\n\nIn Starfield, the B580 continues to struggle. Even with the medium preset, 1% low performance is weaker than expected relative to the average frame rate, which is comparable to the RX 7600.\n\nAt 1440p, the B580 remains similar to the RX 7600 in average frame rate but suffers from weaker 1% lows.\n\nHigh: War Thunder\n\nLastly, we have War Thunder, tested using both DX11 and DX12, which yielded some very interesting results. Starting with the DX11 1080p data, we see significant differences between the 9800X3D and Ryzen 5 5600 configurations. With the 9800X3D, the B580 outperforms both the RTX 4060 and RX 7600 in terms of average frame rate, although it only matches the 1% lows of the Radeon GPU.\n\nSwitching to the Ryzen 5 5600 brings notable changes. The RTX 4060 experiences a 25% performance drop, which aligns with expectations given the slower CPU. However, the RX 7600 sees an even steeper decline, losing 41% of its performance. The B580, unfortunately, fares the worst, with its frame rate dropping by 52% to 184 FPS. While this is still a very playable performance, the relative decline compared to its competitors is concerning.\n\nAt 1440p, the data becomes even more surprising. Using the 9800X3D, the B580 dominates the RTX 4060, which appears to suffer from a bandwidth issue, making the B580 almost 50% faster. It also outpaces the RX 7600 by over 20%.\n\nHowever, when paired with the Ryzen 5 5600, the situation reverses entirely. The RTX 4060 becomes the fastest GPU by a significant margin, and the RX 7600 also outperforms the B580, especially in terms of 1% lows. Enabling upscaling further widens the gap, as it provides no benefit for the B580, while the RTX 4060 gains an 18% boost and the RX 7600 gains 7%. This raises the question of whether DirectX 12, listed as a Beta API option by the developer, could improve the situation for the B580.\n\nHigh: War Thunder (DX12)\n\nSwitching to DX12 dramatically changes the results. At 1080p, the RTX 4060 becomes far more competitive when paired with the 9800X3D, and all three GPUs perform significantly better with the Ryzen 5 5600.\n\nAt 1440p, the B580 and RTX 4060 perform neck and neck regardless of the CPU used. However, the RTX 4060 shows slightly more headroom with the 9800X3D, which is expected since it performed best at 1080p. Interestingly, the use of a low-level API like DX12 helps alleviate the B580's overhead issues, as it should, although similar improvements haven't always been consistent across other games.\n\nAverage 1080p Performance\n\nHere's a look at the average performance across the 12 games tested at 1080p. With the 9800X3D, the B580 is 2% faster than the RTX 4060 and 10% faster than the RX 7600. While this is decent, it's not a substantial lead.\n\nHowever, with the Ryzen 5 5600, the situation becomes less favorable. The B580 is now 8% slower than the RTX 4060 and roughly matches the RX 7600, though with weaker 1% lows.\n\nAverage 1440p Performance\n\nAt 1440p, the data shows mixed results. Starting with native resolution testing, the B580 significantly outperforms the RTX 4060 and RX 7600 when paired with the 9800X3D. This advantage diminishes with the Ryzen 5 5600, as the slower CPU introduces more CPU-limited scenarios, which is expected.\n\nHowever, the 1440p upscaling data highlights some concerning trends. With the 9800X3D, the B580 still holds a slight edge over the RTX 4060. But when paired with the Ryzen 5 5600, the B580's performance falters. It now only matches the RX 7600 and falls 9% behind the RTX 4060.\n\nIf we calculate the cost per frame based on the 1440p upscaling data with the Ryzen 5 5600, the B580 ends up being just 9% better value than both the RTX 4060 and RX 7600. This drops further to 5% better value than the RX 7600 if it's priced at $250, which is currently achievable in some markets.\n\nWhat We Learned\n\nAll this new data changes the narrative significantly, but let's start by discussing how these updated results using the Ryzen 5 5600 compare to the initial review data with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D.\n\nBased on the original review data, the B580 was 21% better value than the Radeon RX 7600 at 1440p and 27% better than the RTX 4060, when paired with the 9800X3D. However, with the 5600, these margins have shifted. The Intel Arc B580 is now 17% better value than the Radeon GPU and 20% better than the GeForce GPU \u2013 still respectable but notably diminished.\n\nIt's important to note that this data represents more of a best-case scenario, particularly when paired with a slower CPU. This is because ultra-quality settings often resulted in frame rates hovering around or below 60 FPS. If you're willing to lower quality settings and enable upscaling, the value of the B580 decreases even further, as demonstrated in the data.\n\nFor instance, when considering the more real-world 1440p upscaling data, the B580 struggles, offering less than 10% better value over the GeForce and Radeon competition. This is far from sufficient, given the compromises inherent to an Arc GPU. In our opinion, Arc GPUs need to offer at least 20% better value to justify those trade-offs.\n\nWe've also been working on a 50-game benchmark comparison between the B580 and RTX 4060. Originally scheduled for release this week, we've had to revise that content in light of the overhead issue, but it will be available soon. From our initial findings, even when using the 9800X3D, the Arc B580 doesn't stack up nearly as well against the RTX 4060 in a broader range of games as it does in this 12-game sample.\n\nFor example, the review data using the 9800X3D at 1440p showed the B580 to be, on average, 14% faster than the RTX 4060 \u2013 a strong result. However, expanding testing to 50 games reduced the margin to just 5%. Even when removing outliers, the lead was only 7%, half of what we reported in the day-one review. When paired with a CPU like the Ryzen 5 5600, the B580 will likely fall behind the RTX 4060, as seen in the upscaling data.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Intel's Arc B580?\n\nFor most users \u2013 indeed, almost all users \u2013 the value proposition of the B580 isn't as strong as it initially appeared. Additional factors must now be considered. For example, to fully benefit from the B580, you'll need a relatively modern and reasonably powerful CPU. Anything slower than the Ryzen 5 5600, and the recommendation shifts firmly to a Radeon or GeForce GPU instead.\n\nThat said, the suitability of the B580 will depend on the specific games you play and how you play them. As a general rule, the overhead issue makes the B580 a poor choice for systems with older or weaker CPUs, which undermines its appeal as a budget-friendly, entry-level GPU. Furthermore, even for users not currently playing CPU-intensive games, there's the possibility they will in the future. In such cases, the B580 could necessitate a CPU upgrade sooner than a Radeon or GeForce GPU would, allowing you to delay that expense.\n\nFor the Arc B580 to maintain the excitement we initially had for it, it really needs to be paired with a Ryzen 5 7600, Core i5-13600K, or a better CPU. Using the B580 with slower CPUs significantly diminishes its value and, depending on the games you play, could completely negate it.\n\nIntel is aware of these findings and is actively investigating the issue. Beyond that, we don't have any official updates. It's possible that a future driver update could address this problem, but as noted in our initial assessment, we're not particularly optimistic about a swift resolution. This is based purely on intuition and a rudimentary understanding of the complexity of the issue.\n\nOne thing is certain: if you can't purchase the Arc B580 for $250 or less, you're better off with the Radeon RX 7600. Alternatively, explore the second-hand market \u2013 you might find a great deal on a Radeon 6700 XT.\n\nShopping Shortcuts:",

Thanks to the courage and dedication of its defense forces, and those who kept the home fires burning, it has bounced back. The Mideast today has changed its face, for the better.\n\nYet our political leaders continue to resist launching an impartial, objective process for learning from this failure, lest they be held culpable.\n\nIn a previous column, I wrote about how the Israeli Air Force conducts an efficient debrief of every flight, long or short, and how we should embrace its method. (\u201cHow to Debrief October 7,\u201d Oct. 21 issue).\n\nIn this column, I present a failure-to-success account from Intel Israel, led by David (Dadi) Perlmutter, who went on to become Intel\u2019s global executive vice president. True, political leadership is categorically different from hi-tech innovation. But there are many similarities. In many ways, leadership is leadership, whatever the context.\n\nPerlmutter spoke to our Technion Entrepreneurship students in November and shared his experiences with the rapt students. For this column, I will use his words drawn from Chapter Five of his Hebrew book Molichim Le\u2019Hatzlacha (\u201cSuperconductors to Success\u201d), structured as an interview. Intel's David Perlmutter. (credit: PINI HEMO)\n\nDo you have examples of failure-to-success from the business world?\n\n\u2018He who doesn\u2019t try, doesn\u2019t fail,\u2019 my father would tell me, then scratch his head and continue: \u2018That\u2019s not true, either because if you never did anything and didn\u2019t try, you actually failed by definition.\u2019\n\nI reflected on this sentence, which was assimilated into my DNA over the years, and I realized that it is not a clich\u00e9. Every failure is preceded by an experience, and if I went back and learned something from the experience, then I already produced much more benefit than doing nothing and failing.\n\nA few years ago I was in Australia, at a time when in the land of the kangaroos they dreamed of moving their economy from focusing on mines, agriculture, and financial services to focusing on advanced technologies. In one of the interviews there, I was asked by the interviewer: \u2018What is the most important thing that needs to be done in order to succeed in Australia\u2019s transition?\u2019\n\nI thought for a moment, and answered: \u2018To fail. People who are afraid of failure don\u2019t try hard enough and don\u2019t dream enough, and therefore don\u2019t succeed, either.\u2019 The interviewer almost fell off her chair. Advertisement\n\nIn the early 1980s, Coca-Cola decided to go for a new branding, the New Coke, they called it. The failure was so resounding that it almost crushed one of the most stable companies in the world. The first to pay the price was the marketing manager who came up with the idea. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now\n\nTen years passed, and the same CEO of Coca-Cola rehired that marketing director.\n\n\u2018Are you crazy?\u2019 he was asked in an interview. \u2018He almost buried the company and you!\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t go crazy,\u2019 replied the CEO. \u2018The guy failed, but I followed him for 10 years, I saw what he did, I saw that he learned all the lessons. I\u2019d rather have someone who failed and rebuilt himself than someone who never failed. This decision proved itself.\u2019\n\nWhat have you yourself learned from failure at Intel?\n\nFor us at Intel Israel, one of the greatest successes was born out of hard, painful failure. And now the story in detail: The personal computer was a dramatic revolution that changed the world. As with every revolution, the stagnation phase came. In the second half of the 1990s, as more competitors entered, prices began to drop and profits were cut. We at Intel Israel were then contacted by Intel management with a mission: Find a way to reduce the cost of the product and its price because our microprocessor competitors were already selling cheaper products.\n\nWe started working, a team of 300 people, for three whole years, at a cost of more than $250 million. At the end of the process, we managed to cut the cost and the price of the microprocessor significantly. But in order to further reduce the cost, we chose a third-party memory technology, which did not meet the goals and caused an additional cost that canceled out all the costs we saved.\n\nThe bottom line? We incurred such a big and resounding failure that our employees feared mass layoffs and the closing of the Israeli operation.\n\nAt this stage, most people face failure by fleeing from it. We too could have admitted failure, try to find fault, convince the management that everything is fine, and move on.\n\nInstead of crying over our fate, we decided to stop and analyze the path we followed until failure. We realized that if we don\u2019t understand what happened, we would continue to fail \u2013 both in the technological choices and in the management decisions.\n\nInitially, one of our employees \u2013 an F-15 pilot in the IDF reserves \u2013 brought his commanders from the Air Force to teach us how to conduct a debrief. Then we sat down and did an in-depth analysis, step by step.\n\nPretty quickly, we realized all the failures, and we discovered one more detail: In all the strenuous work to reduce costs, we caused another phenomenon that we hadn\u2019t planned in the first place \u2013 the reduction of electricity consumption by almost half. A good investigation not only looks for what was not done well but also what can be produced positively.\n\nAt the end of the investigation, we, the management of Intel Israel, gathered all the employees. We stood there in front of them and explained: \u2018We take responsibility. \u2018Now,\u2019 we added, \u2018we found something. Let\u2019s sit together and think about what we can do about it.\u2019\n\nWe started discussing the discovery in groups, and in one of those discussions the engineers of one of the teams stood up and said. \u2018If we know how to make something that consumes less electricity and its battery lifetime is higher, let\u2019s make a laptop out of it. We will introduce wireless communication into it and eliminate the need to connect to electricity with a cord.\u2019\n\nTrue, the laptop is not cheaper than a desktop computer, even significantly more expensive, but people will want it because people like the possibility of being mobile, working from anywhere. If the computer doesn\u2019t need power, you can work for a long time without electricity, and you can even disconnect from the cables that connect to communication. That is how a computer with wireless communication \u2013 Wi-Fi \u2013 was born.\n\nThe technologies we discovered and developed and that led to our failure in the goal set for us led us to the conclusion that we have a revolutionary development in hand. We built a plan and a business model, and approached Intel\u2019s management with a proposal: To shift Intel\u2019s main focus from desktop computers, which accounted for over 80% of the company\u2019s profits, to mobile computers. Through our development, this could be done in a way that would be convenient and functional for customers. The code name chosen for the product, Banias, became the Centrino.\n\nOf course, we were not satisfied with just the chip and the development itself but built business models that relied on low power consumption and included a longer battery life \u2013 computers that were much thinner than was common at the time, with better performance than any laptop at the time and wireless communication. We didn\u2019t give up. We dug and found more and more value arising from the failure analysis.\n\nIntel management pondered. Until then, the only value was the computer\u2019s performance. Given that all computers are stationary, what makes a customer choose one computer over another brand is its performance. We at Intel Israel proposed to change the scale of values.\n\nIt is difficult to change a winning model that brings huge capital to the company and constitutes most of its income. The damage from failure for the company is huge and the benefits are not so clear, especially that new pushy idea that just failed.\n\nThe opposition was dramatic, and in some quarters I was declared an enemy of society. The manager of the desktop group asked to fire one of my employees, who went around the company and pushed the idea. My argument, on the other hand, was that we are only taking a risk in replacing the processor in the desktop computers, which until now was the processor designed for the desktop computers. I decided to keep to myself the belief that the laptop would one day replace the stationary computer.\n\nFor a while, it seemed like we had no one to talk to. I was so discouraged that I decided to quit. On September 11, 2001, the Twin Towers collapsed, and the world changed before our eyes. A dramatic meeting was held at Intel during which my boss \u2013 who later became the CEO of Intel \u2013 decided to take a chance and bet on us, to develop the product.\n\nLater it was also decided to push the product by building a separate brand for the notebook products, something that had not been done at Intel until then.\n\nIn retrospect, we realized during the investigation that we could have identified the failure a few months earlier, thereby saving the company significant sums of money. One of the significant lessons was to learn to notice the point where we go from determination and adherence to the task, to suicide.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy because the balance is very delicate: we don\u2019t want employees to give up every time they encounter a difficulty. Sticking to a mission is an equally important value when dealing with innovation because the problems and pitfalls pile up every day, and catastrophes are commonplace.\n\nWhen we act energetically, one of the strongest qualities is the urge to try to solve failures and keep running forward to meet the goal. As managers and leaders, we tend to radiate optimism and confidence in difficult times.\n\nOur job as managers is to recognize when we are trying to solve a problem, that there is a red flag. In our investigation it became clear that as managers, there was enough data to make the decision earlier. In our blindness, we ignored it. Fortunately, we knew how to recover, learn lessons, and start a new path \u2013 and, in retrospect, a much better one.\n\nPresumably, I admitted, if the laptop had also failed, I would have been shown the door. In practice, this did not happen. We got an opportunity; and the same group that failed, with the same manager that failed, had a huge success that led Intel to one of its best decades.\n\nOf course, like the example from Coca-Cola, sometimes there is no choice but to fire a manager who fails, but only at the end of the process of drawing conclusions and an in-depth investigation, which clarifies where the failures are.\n\nDoes this approach to failure apply to the public sector as well?\n\nIn the State of Israel, one of the main problems of the culture, as it is expressed in investigative committees, is the search for culprits. We are, almost without exception, looking for someone who can be blamed. For the most part, someone whose firing won\u2019t shock the system too much.\n\nWe as a public have a tendency to demand the head of another person every week. On the other hand, many of our politicians have the tendency to sweep problems under the rug and look for other culprits to point to each time.\n\nFinding culprits to blame, as opposed to understanding processes, is the biggest failure in conducting a proper investigation. Fear naturally causes everyone to cast a positive light on themselves \u2013 and thus the problems are blurred, and the path to recovery and improvement runs into a wall. \u2018Not to look for culprits\u2019 was one of the significant messages we learned from the [Israeli] Air Force.\n\nSometimes it is better to give those who fail the opportunity to correct matters. In our case, at Intel, this decision proved itself. Within five years, data communication became common, and today there is no longer any product \u2013 computer, mobile phone, etc. \u2013 that does not have Wi-Fi. Intel changed its product line, which brought Apple and all Internet and cloud companies to use its processors, and Intel Israel became the leading center for the entire company.\n\nFinancially, our failure became a resounding success. Within a few years, Intel took over the market. Of course, I will not claim that every failure is good and useful, but only that a well-managed failure can become an opportunity for change and opening new doors and ways. In this case, we were lucky to fail.\n\nIn the era of accelerated changes, the world is moving from a material-based economy to a knowledge- and content-based economy. It is true that money and oil are important and will probably remain so for the foreseeable future, but the change is evident. Ideas, certainly in a huge economic crisis shaking the world, are just as important or even more important than material.\n\nAs part of the process, there is no way to avoid failure. It would be more correct to say that many failures are to be expected. The trick is to know how to prepare and learn from them.\n\nIs dealing with failure something we can teach our children?\n\nThe education system is an excellent example. When children prepare a project at school and fail, do we give them a zero? A good educator will grade the experience and direct the students to significant learning about the process that led to failure. So does the system itself. It needs to learn from its failures to date.\n\nTo paraphrase Albert Einstein, stupidity is repeating the same action over and over again and expecting a different result. In order to avoid repeating the same action, there is no other way than to go through each step and check what didn\u2019t work. And if something did work, find out why.\n\nWe learn from hi-tech that failures are opportunities we must not squander. Charles Darwin is often misquoted, but the quote he never said is truer than ever: \u2018It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.\u2019 And, we might add, most adaptable in the wake of failure. \u25a0\n\nThe writer heads the Zvi Griliches Research Data Center at S.

The Laminar RH2, bundled exclusively with the Core Ultra 9 285, promises improved cooling performance and a touch of style with integrated ARGB lighting. As for the new RM2, bundled with the remaining 65W Core Ultra 200 series processors, it will be similar to its predecessor but with a bigger plastic frame around the fan.\n\nWhile Intel's CES 2025 keynote was somewhat light on surprises, the company (via @momomo_us) quietly introduced its new stock coolers designed for the 65W non-K Core Ultra 200 series after the keynote.\n\nThe Laminar RH2 is the new \u201chigh-end\u201d model, featuring a sleek design with ARGB lighting and a focus on quiet operation. It uses an aluminium heatsink with a copper heat column for efficient heat transfer. Intel claims that the cooler offers \u201cnear-silent\u201d performance, suggesting improvements in both cooling capacity and noise levels compared to previous stock coolers.\n\nThe Laminar RH2 will be bundled exclusively with the Core Ultra 9 285 processor, the flagship model in the 65W non-K lineup. For the other Core Ultra 5/7 200 series SKUs, Intel will include the smaller Laminar RM2 cooler, which lacks ARGB lighting and a more compact heatsink.\n\nIntel will release the 65W Core Ultra 200 series in a few days, so it shouldn't take long before we can try out the new CPU coolers bundled with them.\n\nKitGuru says: While stock coolers often get a bad rap for their mediocre performance, the Laminar RH2 appears to be a step in the right direction. For Core Ultra 9 285, it should be good enough.\n\nBecome a Patron!",

            "content": "Taking the game from over 60 to over 100 FPS for no extra power is awesome.\n\nIn \"Whisper\" mode, the Core Ultra 9 285H can produce over 60 FPS with just 15W.\n\nLet's talk about frame generation on integrated graphics for a moment. It's not an entirely novel concept; not only does AMD's FSR3 frame generation work on integrated graphics, but AMD has its driver-based AFMF 2 technology that has a dedicated mode for the integrated GPUs in its products.With the launch of its Battlemage GPUs , Intel also debuted its second-generation XeSS technology. In case you haven't put it together, XeSS 2 also includes frame generation (FG) functionality. Unlike XeSS upscaling, though, it's not available to all graphics products. In fact, it's not even available to all Intel graphics products. XeSS FG specifically requires an Arc graphics product that includes Intel's matrix math accelerators, known as \"XMX cores\".At CES 2025, we got the chance to check out a demo of XeSS FG in F1 24 running with \"High\" settings on a 16\" MSI Prestige laptop. That laptop, just like the MSI Prestige 16 AI EVO that we reviewed before , does not include discrete graphics. However, it does have a brand-new Arrow Lake-based Core Ultra 9 285H CPU, and the new chips feature \"Xe-LPG+\" graphics that freshly include Intel's XMX cores.The graphics engine in the Core Ultra 200H processors is fundamentally pretty similar to that in the Core Ultra 100H processors, codenamed \"Meteor Lake\". It has the same number of Xe cores, and it finds its origins in the same \"Alchemist\" architecture as before. However, the XMX-core upgrade in Xe-LPG+ means that the new parts are much better at AI workloads, including XeSS.In fact, while the emphasis in the video is on XeSS FG, the XMX cores in the new Arrow Lake-H parts will also enable them to use the more complex Intel-exclusive path for XeSS upscaling, too. That means that they'll offer both improved performance and radically improved visual clarity roughly on par with NVIDIA's DLSS (and perhaps, AMD's upcoming FSR4, too .)Not only is the new part able to offer a significant performance uplift to over 100 FPS in F1 24 thanks to XeSS FG, but the fellow running the demo, Intel's Mike Bartz, also demonstrated another potential benefit of XeSS FG. Putting the Arrow Lake system into a low-power \"whisper\" mode limited the SoC to just 15W, and yet the machine was able to maintain approximately 60 FPS in F1 24 thanks to XeSS FG.That's particularly impressive considering that the Meteor Lake part was requiring over three times as much power to produce the same visual experience. Now, we have to admit that 30 FPS frame-gen'd to 60 FPS is not the most pleasant experience , and probably not something we would want to do in a racing game like F1. However, for a title like Civilization VI or Marvel's Midnight Suns, this might be a great solution.Discussions on the modern Internet often lack nuance, and frame generation as a technology has both real merit and real limitations. In our tests of XeSS FG on the Arc B580, we found it to work rather well aside from some early implementation weirdness, mostly in the menu. It's a great way to take a game that you can only manage 50 or 60 FPS in all the way up to 100+ frames per second for improved visual fluidity, and it's a real benefit of Intel's new Core Ultra CPUs.By the way, we have a whole pile of short CES 2025 videos on our YouTube channel ; why not check them out and subscribe while you're there, on your coffee break?",

Puget System has compiled the \"Hardware Trends of 2024\", giving a deep dive into how AMD's client and workstation market share has evolved in the past few quarters, and their findings indeed depict an interesting situation.\n\nStarting with the client CPU segment, the situation has favored Team Red tremendously, especially after Q4 2024. AMD saw a whopping 20% rise in market share in just the last year alone, with massive growth seen in Q2-Q4, mainly due to Intel's inability to capitalize on the market hype. With the release of AMD's \"Granite Ridge\" Ryzen 9000 series CPUs and the respective \"3D V-Cache\" models, the firm saw rapid consumer adoption, given that Team Red outperformed Intel in every aspect.\n\nNot just this, but with the persistent CPU instability issues with Intel's 14th Gen & 13th Gen CPUs, Team Blue had already started to lose its market share, moving into H2 2024. To top it all off, releasing the company's Arrow Lake-S desktop CPUs was disappointing. Intel failed to deliver on expectations, so AMD managed to be ahead of its competitor in next-gen CPU launch. AMD has claimed that Intel's Arrow Lake was a \"horrible\" product, and this sluggish performance has been reflected in the change in market dynamics.\n\nPuget Systems has also shared insights into the workstation CPU segment, showing AMD's dominance. AMD's Threadripper lineup accounts for a significant market share, with Intel's Xeon counterpart holding a mere 10% of the orders. Yet again, this shows how Intel has failed to sustain itself in the CPU business, and things aren't looking suitable for the company in the future, given how aggressive AMD has been with its products.",

As a leading hardware provider for the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, Nvidia's sales and profits are soaring. The stock rose 171% in 2024 and more than 720% since OpenAI released the Nvidia-powered ChatGPT system in 2021.\n\nNvidia is the talk of the town and many investors expect its business to keep skyrocketing. But the enthusiasm has its limits. Some would say that Nvidia's soaring stock price already accounts for many years of high-octane growth. This market darling might be due for a price correction, or maybe it's just primed for lower price gains over the next couple of years.\n\nI'm not saying you should forget about Nvidia. Even if the stock is poised for a price correction, I'm still talking about a dominant technology leader in a thriving AI market. Holding the stock should work out in the long run.\n\nStill, I don't think Nvidia is the best tech stock to buy right now. Have you taken a close look at Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) lately? You might like what you find in the undervalued chip giant.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIntel's recent struggles\n\nIntel has seen its share of issues in recent years. There's been turnover in the CEO office, longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is stealing market share from Intel in a couple of key segments, and the company formerly known as \"Chipzilla\" has not found a footing in the surging AI opportunity.\n\nAs such, the stock has fallen 71% in the last five years to trade at just 1.5 times trailing sales and 20 times next-year earnings estimates. These valuation measures are cheap from a historical perspective and extremely affordable next to AMD's and Nvidia's lofty ratios.\n\nIn short, the market seems to be pricing Nvidia's stock for perfection while pricing Intel's stock for absolute disaster. The latter's market value is currently below its book value, as though suggesting that investors might be better off if Intel shut down its business, sold its chip factories and other assets, and found a tax-free way to return the resulting cash to shareholders.\n\nIntel's ambitious long-term plan\n\nAnd I think that's a shortsighted view of Intel.\n\nYou see, the semiconductor pioneer is making significant shifts to its business model. It's a costly plan that involves spending about $100 billion on domestic chip-making facilities over the next five years.\n\nIt's also an ambitious business idea that should turn Intel into a world-class third-party chip builder with most of its factories on American soil. That's an important detail, because the global tech industry's reliance on Taiwan-based manufacturing plants may not be sustainable in the long run.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against other stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed.\n\nIn his appearance on Squawk on the Street the day CES took place in Las Vegas, Jim Cramer commented on the stock market division that persisted throughout 2024 and is present in 2025 as well. The division has seen technology stocks perform well, while other rate-sensitive sectors such as industrial and materials stocks have languished. Cramer commented on the reasons behind it: \u201cI think that\u2019s because people perceive that the rest of the market is hostage to rates. And that tech is not hostage to anything. So I\u2019m aware of that and I\u2019m just concerned that you have this speech tonight, nine-thirty Jensen Huang, everyone\u2019s, we\u2019re really kind of, whatever he says, is going to move things.\u201d\n\nIn fact, this division is so prevalent that some of the biggest asset managers in the world have also been unable to remain immune to it. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared that it commented about \u201cprivate equity and private equity trying to get into the 401(k) business.\u201d He added and mentioned, \u201cMarc Rowan CEO of Apollo says, I jokingly say sometimes we levered the entire retirement [inaudible] to NVIDIA\u2019s performance! So [inaudible] we\u2019ve got the NVIDIAs of the world which everybody likes and on the other hand, there\u2019s these stocks are, they really are hostage to rates and no one wants them!\u201d\n\nHowever, even though technology stocks have stood the test of high interest rates, they might falter in some circumstances. One of these can be bond yields, and if the thirty-year yield spikes to 5%, then Cramer believes \u201cthat will start interfering with this tech rally that seems to be motivated by a lot of analysts coming out and saying this is the time, there\u2019s now reacceleration in tech spend.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also speculated on what Jensen Huang might end up talking about at CES later in the day. He stated \u201cI think that one of the things that Jensen is going to talk about today are all the new use cases. This is tonight\u2019s CES talk. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we start hearing about robots. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we didn\u2019t hear a lot about Tesla. Tesla and self-driving cars. Tesla and the neural network that is based on NVIDIA!\u201d\n\nAlong with industrial and material stocks, another sector that\u2019s caught Cramer\u2019s attention is banks. Mentioning a recent investment bank note about the sector he believes that \u201cone of the groups that I think we have to focus on, there\u2019s a really interesting, uh, Barclays piece on the banks. Darkest before dawn. Raising the group for the first time since 2019, emphasis here on Citi.\u201d",

These next-gen units replace the previous, weaker stock coolers across the board.\n\nThe most notable upgrade offered by these new stock cooler designs, which we noticed thanks to @momomo_us on Twitter, isn't immediately visible. But last time around, lower-end coolers used less-conductive aluminum for the baseplate instead of just the fins. The more conductive copper is a far superior material for a baseplate, and Laminar RH1 had it, while Laminar RM1 and RS1 did not. However, the new Laminar RH2 and RM2 CPU cooler designs include copper baseplates.\n\nIntel Core Ultra (Series 2) CoolerLaminar RH2 / Laminar RM2 pic.twitter.com/N3EJc8UVWRJanuary 7, 2025\n\nBesides the copper baseplate, there's also an immediately noticeable improvement in aesthetics. While I'm as much a fan of gaudy technology as the next guy, the excessive lighting and hard blues on the last-gen coolers have been toned down significantly for RH2 and RM2.\n\nIntel also claims 2.2 BA \"near-silent\" Sound Power Level on Laminar RH2 and 3.6 BA \"quiet\" performance on RM2, marking .4 and .3 improvements in noise levels over last gen (RH1 2.6 BA and RH2 3.9 BA), respectively. Sound Pressure Level reaches 23 dBA on Laminar RH2 and 30 dBA on Laminar RM2, so these seem like reasonable targets for air coolers not intended for overclocking.\n\nBoth new coolers have a three-year limited warranty and the aforementioned copper base heatsink. In addition to being larger and quieter, the Laminar RH2 also provides ARGB lighting via a light ring, though the inevitable blues present will somewhat limit your range of mixable colors.\n\nFor more detailed specifications on coolers you'll never be purchasing on their own, Intel's official documentation for Laminar RH2 and Laminar RM2 should fill in the rest of what you may need to know. Overall, these are just renewed stock coolers meant to support 65 Watt desktop CPUs running in standard conditions, now with improved aesthetics and reportedly decent performance gains versus the last-gen options thanks to some key upgrades.\n\nOf course, anybody hoping to do serious overclocking with Intel Core Ultra Series 2 CPUs will want to skip stock coolers entirely and instead choose from the best, market-proven CPU coolers beyond the basics Intel is willing to give its non-overclocking enthusiast customers.",

The semiconductor company's share price was down 4.6% as of 11:40 a.m. ET amid the backdrop of a 1.6% decline for the S&P 500 index and a 2% fall for the Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nThe broader market is falling today due to bearish macroeconomic indicators, and Intel stock is participating in the pullback. The company's share price is also likely being pressured by unfavorable coverage from analysts.\n\nIntel stock falls on jobs data\n\nInvestors got some unwelcome news when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics published its latest jobs data this morning. The report showed that 256,000 jobs were added in December, which came in far ahead of the 155,000 job additions that had been called for by the average economist estimate. The jobs data makes it likely that the Federal Reserve will be more cautious when it comes to cutting interest rates.\n\nWhile the Fed delivered three interest rate cuts last year, rates have remained relatively high as a means of combatting inflation. Investors have been hoping that easing inflationary pressures would pave the way for the central banking authority to create a more favorable environment for stocks by cutting rates. But December's jobs data suggests that the U.S. economy may still be running hot and that inflation issues could prove stickier than many had hoped.\n\nAnalysts see challenges for Intel\n\nBefore the market opened this morning, Mizuho published new coverage on Intel. The firm maintained a neutral rating on the stock, but it lowered its one-year price target from $23 per share to $21 per share. As of this writing, Mizuho's new target suggests potential upside of roughly 10.5% -- but that's hardly a roaring bullish endorsement.\n\nGoldman Sachs also commented on Intel in a research note published about AMD today. Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari actually downgraded his rating on AMD from buy to neutral and lowered his one-year price target from $175 per share to $129 per share, but he said that he expects the company will be able to continue winning market share from Intel in the PC and server markets. Notably, the analyst highlighted the rise of Arm as a competitive risk that could pressure AMD -- and it could also put strains on Intel's comeback initiatives.",

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nAt CES 2025, Intel let journalists into its private \u201cInnovation Showcase,\u201d where we saw things like prototype next-gen laptops and giant stereo 3D handheld gaming PCs.\n\nWhile I was there, I also spotted a heavy metal handheld on a table that didn\u2019t seem... fully attached... to its screen. When I lifted the screen, it came away easily.\n\nIt felt suspiciously light to be a real tablet, so I flipped it over and saw three connectors underneath:\n\nAbove it, on a shelf, was a laptop with a suspiciously sized chunk of plastic on the bottom that looked like a perfect match. A minute later, Intel gaming evangelist Colin Helms confirmed: I was looking at a concept modular PC.\n\nThat module contains a complete Intel Lunar Lake computer, the entire guts you\u2019d need to make one work outside of peripherals and screen. It\u2019s basically a reboot of Intel\u2019s abandoned Compute Card idea, except it\u2019s not all Intel\u2019s doing and you probably shouldn\u2019t ever expect it to ship.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept from Quanta, a company whose name you don\u2019t typically see on the laptops and tablets they create, because Quanta is an ODM (like Compal, Pegatron, Wistron, and Apple\u2019s better known iPhone supplier Foxconn) that designs and manufactures hardware on behalf of brand names.\n\nQuanta\u2019s calling the whole modular system the \u201cAI8A,\u201d and the aforementioned module at its heart is the \u201cDetachable AI Core.\u201d Helms told me it plugs into other concept computers as well, including an all-in-one desktop that Intel didn\u2019t have to show off. And presumably, like the Compute Card idea, you could upgrade your computer just by putting a new new module into it.\n\nThe modular laptop has lots of concept-y bells and whistles too, so many that Intel\u2019s CES staff hadn\u2019t even worked them all out yet.\n\nFor starts, the laptop has a motorized hinge, so you can tell it to open and close its own lid; it also claims to offer eye-tracking that lets you sling around multitasking windows just by looking at where you\u2019d like them to be. It apparently comes with a mouse integrated into a ring that you could wear.\n\nThe most mundane: a built-in Qi wireless charging pad in the palmrest, with indicator lights to show your battery\u2019s remaining capacity.\n\nI couldn\u2019t try any of it working, unfortunately, nor did I manage to ask what \u201cAI8A\u201d means, because I mistakenly thought it said Aiba until I checked my photos closely just now. Nor could we hotswap the module between the handheld and laptop, since the module apparently doesn\u2019t have a battery inside.\n\nAgain, this is a cool computing concept car: it\u2019s not likely that this computer will ever ship, even in a more practical / less gadgety form. Thankfully, we have begun to see some real, practical modularity in the laptop space since the death of Intel\u2019s Compute Card. Framework just celebrated its fifth anniversary this week, and Dell took a smaller step forward at CES with its first modular repairable USB-C port.\n\nPhotos by Sean Hollister / The Verge",

But I didn't expect that each of these companies would, in their own way, be putting the pedal to the metal when it comes to power for their chip designs. After all, we've spent the last few years covering AI PC CPUs that was targeting efficiency more than raw performance.\n\nWhile NVIDIA RTX 5000 GPUs seem to deliver the performance leap we expected over its 2022-era cards, AMD is also redefining what's possible for mobile workstations with its Ryzen AI Max chips, which combine powerful graphics with gobs of integrated memory. Intel isn't sitting still either \u2014 it's finally moving Arrow Lake into the high-performance and gaming arena with its Core Ultra 200HX chips, which can reach up to 24 cores and 5.5GHz speeds.\n\nI'm not just talking about power in the sheer performance sense, either. NVIDIA's $1,999 RTX 5090 requires a 1,000-watt power supply to function and uses up to 575 watts. The Ryzen AI Max chips, meanwhile, could eat up as much as 120-watts. Intel's Core Ultra 200HX chips go as high as 120-watts. Clearly, none of this hardware is meant for anyone concerned about their energy bills or potential laptop battery life.\n\n\n\nRTX 5090 RTX 5080 RTX 5070 Ti RTX 5070 RTX 4090 Architecture Blackwell Blackwell Blackwell Blackwell Lovelace CUDA cores 21,760 10,752 8,960 6,144 16,384 AI TOPS 3,352 1,801 1,406 988 1,321 Tensor cores 5th Gen 5th Gen 5th Gen 5th Gen 4th Gen RT cores 4th Gen 4th Gen 4th Gen 4th Gen 3rd Gen VRAM 32 GB GDDR7 16 GB GDDR7 16 GB GDDR7 12 GB GDDR7 24 GB GDDR6X Memory bandwidth 1,792 GB/sec 960 GB/sec 896 GB/sec 672 GB/sec 1,008 GB/sec TGP 575W 360W 300W 250W 450W\n\nSo what do you get for all of this energy consumption? AMD says the RTX 5090 will deliver roughly twice the performance of its previous flagship, the $1,499 RTX 4090. In a 4K Cyberpunk 2077 demo with full ray tracing, the 4090 hovered around 108 fps while the 5090 was reaching 240 fps. That frame count is a bit controversial, though, since the RTX 5090's DLSS 4 AI upscaling generates three frames for every natively rendered frame. The end result may look smoother to most people, but some gamers might question the integrity of so-called false frames.\n\nIt's those same AI-generated frames that allow NVIDIA to proclaim that the $549 RTX 5070 could be as powerful as the 4090. That may be true when it comes to pure frames-per-second count, but it certainly won't be for rasterized performance without DLSS 4.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nAMD's Ryzen AI Max chips aren't aiming for the same sort of graphical heights as NVIDIA's new GPUs, but they're still notable for the sheer amount of hardware they contain. The top-of-the-line Ryzen AI Max+ 395 sports 16 CPU Zen 5 cores, 50 TOPS of AI performance and 40 RDNA 3.5 GPU compute units. According to AMD, it should be on-part with Apple's 14-core M4 Pro chip (and even faster in the Vray benchark), and it's 2.6 times faster in 3D rendering than Intel's Core Ultra 9 288V.\n\nAMD\n\nIn an interview with AMD CVP and product CTO Joe Macri, he told Engadget that the success of Apple Silicon as a major reason why the Ryzen AI Max exists. \"What Apple showed was consumers don't care what's inside the box,\" he said. Macri later noted, \"I always knew, because we were building APUs, and I'd been pushing for this big APU forever, that I could build, a system that was smaller, faster, and I could give much higher performance at the same power.\"\n\nAMD also briefly previewed its RDNA 4 graphics at CES, though at this point it's clearly aiming for the mid-range and not NVIDIA's RTX 5090. Notably, AMD will debut a new AI powered upscaling technology in RDNA 4 GPUs, FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4). That should finally give AMD a way to directly compete against NVIDA's DLSS, which for years has looked better than earlier versions of FSR. The first RDNA 4 cards, the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT, will arrive sometime in the first quarter.\n\nIntel's presence at CES 2024 was more muted than the competition, but loyalists will likely appreciate the new Core Ultra 200HX chips. While they scale back NPU performance from its recent AI PC hardware (12 TOPS down from 48 TOPS), the Core Ultra 9 285HX looks like a 24-core beast. It'll be interesting to see how it competes AMD's Ryzen AI 300 hardware, though it likely won't stand a chance against the Ryzen AI Max when paired up with a discrete GPU.\n\nIntel\n\nEngadget spent the week of January 5 reporting live from CES 2025 in Las Vegas.

            "content": "Intel's Panther Lake to drive AI PC growth, foundry comeback in 2H25\n\nAhead of CES 2025, Intel has emphasized its dedication to expanding its foothold in the AI-powered PC market. The company revealed plans to begin mass production of its \"premium\" processors built on the advanced Intel 18A (1.8nm) process node in the second half of 2025.\n\nIntel 18A \"premium\" processors slated for 2H25\n\nThe success of these processors is pivotal for both Intel's AI PC market share and its foundry business ambitions. According to reports from Tom's Hardware and CRN, Intel Products CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus confirmed that customer samples of Intel 18A processors will be available starting in the second half of 2025. She added that Intel plans to further strengthen its AI PC product portfolio throughout 2025 and beyond.\n\nWhile Holthaus did not name specific products, Intel's August 2024 announcement suggests the reference is to Panther Lake. The company previously confirmed that the Panther Lake AI PC processor and the Clearwater Forest server chip, both built on the Intel 18A process, have been successfully manufactured, powered on, and booted into their operating systems.\n\nIndustry speculation suggests that Panther Lake processors will feature core counts between 8 and 16, depending on the model's target segment. Designed for notebooks, Panther Lake aligns with earlier offerings like Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake. Intel has yet to reveal details about its next-generation desktop processor, which will follow Arrow Lake-S.\n\nPanther Lake: a key to Intel's return to glory\n\nPanther Lake's market performance is critical for Intel's broader success. Reports indicate that 70% of these processors will be produced in-house, lowering costs and boosting profitability. With Intel's foundry division still operating at a loss, turning its financials around is essential for reclaiming its former industry leadership.\n\nThe Intel 18A process, utilized in Panther Lake, marks Intel's first node available to external foundry clients. The company sees Intel 18A as the cornerstone in its efforts to regain process leadership from rivals TSMC and Samsung Electronics.\n\nThe successful mass production of Panther Lake will be a key indicator of Intel's foundry capabilities, shaping the perceptions of potential external clients.\n\nIntel describes the Intel 18A as its biggest technological leap since the FinFET era, incorporating RibbonFET GAA transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery technology.\n\nWhile backside power delivery is crucial for high-power processors, its application in Panther Lake remains uncertain. With a processor base power (PBP) of just 45 watts, it is unclear if this technology will feature in the design. Intel has yet to provide clarification.\n\nIntel expects its first external foundry client using the Intel 18A process to reach tape-out by early 2025. If successful, mass production could begin in early 2026, slightly trailing TSMC's 2nm (N2) node, scheduled for the latter half of 2025.\n\nIntel reports strong interest in the Intel 18A process from foundry clients, citing performance metrics that outpace TSMC's 3nm and 2nm technologies in certain aspects.\n\nUltimately, the real-world performance of Intel 18A will determine its success in the competitive foundry market.",

It\u2019s no surprise that such a splendid chip is proving popular among consumers, gamers in particular, but questions have since arisen concerning the shortage of stock. According to a tongue-in-cheek comment from AMD, you can partly point the finger at Intel.\n\nDuring a roundtable interview with AMD at CES 2025, Tom\u2019s Hardware asked about the reason behind Ryzen 7 9800X3D stock shortages. In response, AMD Chief Architect of Gaming Solutions, Frank Azor said: \u201cWe knew we built a great part. We didn\u2019t know the competitor had built a horrible one, so the demand has been a little higher than we forecasted.\u201d To be completely clear, Azor is referring to Intel and its Core Ultra 200S Series.\n\nWhile Club386 doesn\u2019t share Azor\u2019s likely half-joking assessment of Core Ultra 9 285K, there\u2019s merit to demand for AMD\u2019s CPU vastly outweighing its competitor. Looking at Ryzen 7 9800X3D sales figures relative to Core Ultra 200S, the popularity of each isn\u2019t remotely close. To be fair to Intel, though, the X3D processor is also running rings around its Ryzen 9000 Series siblings.\n\nWith Core Ultra 200S performance fixes now readily available, it\u2019s possible that interest in the CPUs could improve and alleviate supply pressures for AMD. However, the jury\u2019s still out on how much said patches boost the competitiveness of chips like Core Ultra 9 285K relative to Ryzen 7 9800X3D. With CES 2025 winding down, this particular picture should become clear soon but I can\u2019t foresee this being an easy turnaround for Intel.\n\nComplicating matters further is the imminent arrival of Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D. AMD claims the former of the two processors easily matches or greatly exceeds the performance of Core Ultra 9 285K, in both applications and games. You and I should take these claims with a pinch of salt but it won\u2019t be too long before Club386 gets its hands on the 3D V-Cache flagship and puts them to the test.\n\nWhile we wait for the next batch of 3D V-Cache processors to make their splash on the CPU space, be sure to follow Club386 on Google News. In doing so, you\u2019ll know as soon as our reviews for each chip are available to read, alongside all the news and our thoughts on today\u2019s tech.",

At CES 2025, Intel showed off its latest lineup of Arrow Lake AI chips for laptops.\n\nLast year, Intel announced the Core Ultra 200V series of laptop chips with support for artificial intelligence features. However, the power of the SoCs could fall a bit short for portable gaming enthusiasts. Now, the company is releasing new options that have a little more raw power without giving up AI. The Core Ultra 200H chips are aimed at \u201cperformance thin and light\u201d notebooks, according to the brand.

For people who want a mobile GPU that can run games, the Intel Core Ultra 200HX series offers an \u201call-in-one\u201d package. The most powerful chip in the lineup is the Core Ultra 9 285H with a 16-core CPU (6x high-performance cores, 8x energy-efficient cores, and 2x ultra-low-power cores).

The top-of-the-line model is the Core Ultra 9 285HX. This chip has a 24-core CPU (8x high-performance cores, 16x energy-efficient cores) that tops out at 5.5 GHz. As previously mentioned, the design does not include a powerful GPU, instead integrating a basic 4-core Intel one. You\u2019ll find these SoCs in setups with more powerful laptop GPUs from vendors like NVIDIA or AMD.\n\nIntel revealed that the first laptops powered by Core Ultra 200H chips will arrive sometime in Q1 2025.",

            "content": "CES 2025 has been dominated by Nvidia, and the RTX 5090 easily provides the best gaming experience I\u2019ve ever had. But with it comes that sky-high $1,999 price tag, and I wouldn\u2019t judge you if you weren\u2019t willing to donate a kidney to get that kind of cash.\n\nSo, what if you wanted a great gaming experience without breaking the bank? That\u2019s where the Intel Arc B580 comes in. I got to test this $250 GPU made for 1440p gaming with a rather intense experiment \u2014 racing in F1 24 with a triple monitor setup.\n\nAnd after tearing it up and annihilating the lap record around Las Vegas (I am Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s resident sim racer, after all), I can safely say that this low-cost graphics card is a bit of a budget breakthrough. Let me explain.\n\nWhat\u2019s the setup?\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nSo, to take you on a tour of the whole rig, that PC is packed with the Battlemage GPU (specifically the ASRock Steel Legend B580) that comes with 20 Compute units, 20 Ray Tracing cores and a whopping 160 AI cores to drive the frame generation I\u2019ll tell you about soon.\n\nMost importantly, the B580 is also home to 12GB of GDDR6 video memory. That\u2019s the same amount that you\u2019d find in the more expensive RTX 4070, and it\u2019s a healthy amount for keeping a lot of game graphics instructions stored for quick reference.\n\nYou\u2019ve also got the Intel Core Ultra 5 245K CPU, 48GB of DDR5 RAM and a Samsung 980 SSD \u2014 all patched onto an MSI Z890 motherboard with a 1,000-watt power supply. A quick trip to PC Part Picker to get all these (including that liquid cooler and a case) brings the price to just under $1,500 \u2014 a surprisingly low cost for a mid-tier gaming PC.\n\nAs for the monitors, you\u2019ve got a triple QHD monitor setup for the full panoramic racing experience \u2014 paired with the Thrustmaster T-GT II racing wheel and T-LCM pedals.\n\nOver 100 frames per second\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nAs I was racing, I saw framerates peak at 120 FPS very consistently, dipping to the mid-100s in moments when speeding down the graphically intense Las Vegas Boulevard at over 200 MPH\u2026 Yea, on three monitors. How is Intel pulling this off?\n\nWell, it comes down to its AI technologies running in the background of all those cores. Xe Super Sampling 2 is busy rendering a higher quality image at a lower resolution (when pixel peeping, I\u2019m guessing around 1080p upscaled to that full 1440p).\n\nXe Frame Generation is Team Blue\u2019s version of DLSS, and that combines with Xe Low Latency technologies to ensure that all those AI-generated frames don\u2019t create a noticeable latency between your steering inputs and the game.\n\nCan you notice these at work? Yes. The telltale sign is what\u2019s called \u201cghosting.\u201d As the AI predicts and paints in the next frame, it may leave a bit of a ghost trail of the frame before it, which, in a fast-moving game like F1 24, you can see happening in the surroundings you drive by.\n\nWhile it's noticeable, it certainly wasn\u2019t distracting while putting the card in the laps \u2014 a minor miracle when you think you\u2019re getting this graphics card for less than $300!\n\nOutlook\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nAfter witnessing what the RTX 5090 could do, I was a little apprehensive about checking out Team Blue\u2019s tech. I\u2019d heard all the praise from my mates in the industry for the B580 GPU, but I didn\u2019t know what I was personally in for.\n\nIt turns out that apprehension was misplaced. Thanks to Intel\u2019s AI trickery, cheap doesn\u2019t have to mean compromised gaming performance anymore. When it comes to sim racing, you don\u2019t have to feel bound to get an expensive graphics card to run it without any hitches.\n\nAnd while, yes, you will always get a better experience if you put more money into it (and the wait for Intel\u2019s Xess to come to more than 201 games continues), this is one of the PC gaming highlights in terms of price-to-performance.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As the DC area lay stunned by snowfall, over 900 people tuned in Tuesday for hours of virtual briefings on a forthcoming Army contract vehicle for \u201cArtificial Intelligence & Software at Pace\u201d (AIS@P). At stake is a projected $1 billion over the next decade.\n\nBut to keep tech updates innovative, competitive and quick, AIS@P aims to divide those dollars into at least 40 individual \u201ctask orders\u201d of at most $25 million apiece, with anywhere from five to 30 vendors bidding for each one. (It\u2019s possible that a few task orders may exceed that $25 million threshold, officials said). Only vendors who prove their expertise in the relevant specialties will be allowed to bid on relevant task orders \u2014 poor performers will be liable to get kicked out of the approved \u201cpool\u201d at any time, and promising new vendors may be brought on as they emerge.\n\nEach individual task order is supposed to be turned around within a month: Once the official Request For Proposals (RFP) is published, vendors will have just 14 days to submit bids, and the Army will have 16 days to evaluate and make awards. That\u2019s an extraordinarily tight timeline for a Pentagon procurement, especially since AIS@P will follow the standard Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). But, officials argued, such speed is essential to 21st century warfare.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying \u2026 to really open the aperture for government to access innovative solutions \u2026 lower barriers to entry [and] keep pace in our space of AI and EW,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Ed Barker, the Army\u2019s Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, & Sensors (PEO-IEW&S).\n\nBarker\u2019s Chief of Staff, Kyle Perkins, added: \u201cWe fully expect, when we get out into the fight, we\u2019re going to see things we haven\u2019t seen before, [so] our EW systems have to change at a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d\n\nWhile PEO-IEW&S is creating AIS@P for the PEO\u2019s own programs, which cover everything from backpack radio jammers to truck-sized satellite terminals, officials suggested other Army organizations might use the contract vehicle as well. It\u2019s worth noting that an earlier PEO-IEW&S initiative on AI, Project Linchpin, was swiftly scaled up to serve the entire Army. (Linchpin plans to make extensive use of AIS@P, its leadership said during the briefings).\n\nCertainly Barker made no bones about his big ambitions: \u201cThe end goal is really trying to change how the Army does business,\u201d he said.\n\nTight Timelines, Grand Ambitions\n\nTo start, however, Barker and his team must get AIS@P off the ground. While officials have been talking informally with industry for some time, the PEO issued a draft RFP in late November, accompanied by feedback forms, a survey, and an email inbox for comments. At Tuesday\u2019s industry day briefings, Perkins said he wanted to get a final Request For Information (RFI) out \u201con or around 13 January,\u201d an updated draft RFP in February, and a final RFP in March.\n\nThe initial contract awards should come this summer, Perkins continued, in the final quarter of federal fiscal year 2025. But, he and other officials emphasized, those are just \u201cbase\u201d contracts. While they\u2019ll carry a \u201cnominal\u201d monetary value, the real worth of these initial awards is that they get a company in the \u201cpool\u201d the Army deems qualified to bid.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not in one of the pools, you cannot bid on a task order,\u201d one official emphasized.\n\nCurrently, the plan is for seven pools. Four will cover aspects of AI: onboarding (reserved for small businesses); data management and labeling; model development and training; and test and evaluation. Three will apply to software more broadly: engineering support, electromagnetic spectrum support (including highly sensitive electronic warfare techniques), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). A single company may belong to multiple pools, but it has to qualify for each one separately; that means submitting a separate proposal, white paper, tech demo, and past-performance data tailored to each pool\u2019s specific technical focus.\n\nOnce the pools are filled, the Army can begin issuing individual task orders (TOs), which could be for everything from licensing off-the-shelf software to developing new cutting-edge tech. Each TO should cover six months of work, with options to renew. In all other respects, the task orders can vary widely, using different contract types, security rules, intellectual property agreements and technical standards.\n\nThe vendor pools won\u2019t be static, officials emphasized: The Army reserves the right to \u201cofframp\u201d underperformers and to bring on promising new vendors at any time. This process, which officials called \u201cperpetual onboarding,\u201d will open to newcomers sometime in early FY26, Perkins said. The Army may even add new pools as new technology needs emerge.\n\nConstant communication between industry and the Army is essential to making all this work, officials emphasized over and over again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve asked for feedback and you haven\u2019t been shy to give that,\u201d Barker said. \u201cYou\u2019re making us better \u2026 I appreciate the fact you give it to us straight.\u201d",

Intel said it can now offer a whole-vehicle platform, including high-performance compute, discrete graphics, artificial intelligence, power management and zonal controller offerings.\n\nDrilling deeper, it said a whole-vehicle platform reduces inefficiencies of traditional fragmented approaches to vehicle architecture, and that optimising a vehicle\u2019s entire electronic architecture can lead to significant cost reductions and performance improvements.\n\nAmong the key announcements was the Intel Automotive Virtual Development Environment on AWS, described by the two IT giants as a way to ensure true hardware and software parity from cloud to car. The offering is designed to address challenges throughout the vehicle development life cycle, enabling engineers to switch between virtual and physical hardware setups.\n\nIt integrates Intel Xeon processor-based Amazon EC2 instances and, for the first time, incorporates Intel\u2019s Automotive SDV SoCs in the AWS environment, with the objective of eliminating the need for expensive electronic control unit simulators or developer boards. The firms believe their collaboration provides a unified service that accelerates innovation, reduces R&D costs and speeds time to market.\n\nSupporting the new platform, Intel has also introduced the availability of the adaptive control unit (ACU), designed for electric vehicle power trains and zonal controller applications, and to alleviate problems caused with traditional time and sequential processing-based micro and zonal controllers, which Intel said can struggle to handle multiple workloads due to limited deterministic processing capabilities.\n\nThe ACU U310 supports the consolidation of multiple real-time, safety-critical and cyber-secure functions, applications and domains (X-in-1) into a single chip, and the new ACU family integrates a flexible logic area that offloads real-time control algorithms from the CPU cores to offer reliable performance, freedom from interference and deterministic data delivery even when consolidating multiple microcontroller workloads into a single zonal control unit. The claimed result is greater workload consolidation, lower cost, and enhanced safety, cyber security and performance.\n\nAlready, automotive firms are examining the technology. Stellantis Motorsports has selected Intel as a key technology partner, adopting the Adaptive Control technology into its next-generation inverter control for enhanced performance and efficiency in competitive racing environments. In this implementation, the Intel technology will control the electric motor and recover energy during braking phases. The inverter plays a crucial role during a Formula E race, where any gain in efficiency is transformed into a precious competitive advantage.\n\nIn a further deployment, Karma Automotive is to support Intel\u2019s ACU, showcasing an Intel co-branded inverter featuring optimal pulse pattern control algorithms to improve efficiency and enable four unique driving profiles, including innovative features such as torque ripple reduction and range boost.",

            "content": "At a small roundtable session with AMD executives at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, we asked the company for details about continuing shortages of its flagship gaming-optimized Ryzen 7 9800X3D \u2014 currently the uncontested best CPU for gaming \u2014 and when we can expect the supply to improve. AMD chalked it up to unprecedented demand and noted that Intel's \"horrible\" product, also known as Arrow Lake, has led to wildly increased demand that has pushed far beyond initial projections. In a separate roundtable, I also had the chance to ask Intel about its plans to fire back at AMD's dominating 3D V-Cache processors.\n\n\"We knew we built a great part. We didn't know the competitor [Intel] had built a horrible one,\" quipped AMD executive Frank Azor. \"So the demand has been a little higher than we forecasted.\"\n\nIt's no secret that Intel's Arrow Lake delivered underwhelming gaming performance at launch. Although the company has promised a 'fix' for the issue, we recently tested the full and complete patch on multiple systems. We found the patch does nothing to help (at least on two motherboards) and that the newer Windows revision required for the fix has benefited competing processors more, thus making Intel's Arrow Lake competitive positioning even worse than at launch. We'll publish that testing soon.\n\nAll of this means that Intel is far less competitive than AMD anticipated. That's exacerbated the longer-than-normal lead time for building an X3D processor. Due to the long lead times associated with building modern high-end processors, forecasting demand is key. Now that demand has far outstripped the original production targets, the company is cranking higher production into gear\u2014 but that takes time to filter down to the retail market.\n\n\"We have been ramping our manufacturing capacity, or the monthly, quarterly output of X3D parts, period, and that's 7000 [series] as well as 9000X3D,\" said AMD executive David McAfee. \"It's crazy how much we have increased over what we were planning. I would say the demand we've seen for the 9800X3D and the 7800X3D has been unprecedented. So the demand has been higher than ever.\"\n\n\"Building a traditional semiconductor, it's basically 12 to 13 weeks from when you start a wafer to when you get a product out the other end of the machine,\" McAfee explained. \"The [3D V-Cache] stacking process adds time to that, and so it's longer than a quarter horizon [three months] to really ramp output of those products. And so we're working very, very hard to catch up with demand. I think as we go through the first half of this year, you'll see us continue to increase the output of X3D. There's no secret, X3D has become a far more important part of our CPU portfolio than I think any of us would have predicted a year ago. And I think that trend will continue in the future, and we are ramping capacity to ensure we catch up with that demand for as long as customers want those X3D parts.\"\n\nMcAfee said there isn't any particular component or part of the production flow creating the bottleneck.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"It's the problem that you've got that lead time to build individually the CCD wafer, the cache wafer, and then the stacking process that follows that, which also adds a considerable amount of time. It's a non-trivial timeline when you're talking about building X3D products.\"\n\nMcAfee also said new 99x0X3D products won't help spread the demand, as customers choose the 8-core X3D parts 10-to-1 over the higher core count X3D models.\n\n\"If I look historically at our 7000X3D products, the 70800X3D was dramatically the highest volume part in that product stack. I think that for those 12- and 16-core parts, there are certain types of customers that buy those. But I think the reality is if you are truly a creator, you probably still buy the 9950X. The X3D doesn't add much at all for creator workloads. [...] It's like a percentage of incremental performance by having the X3D there.\" McAfee said.\n\n\"My belief is, in the 9000 series, those higher core count products, there'll be some demand there, but it'll still be 10-to-1, or more, on the eight-core X3D parts because they're just such a great gaming part for a pure gamer, there's nothing else like it,\" he finished.\n\nSo now it's a waiting game. AMD has ramped production, but it will take some time for the flood of shiny new 9800X3D chips to come to market. By the time more units arrive, we'll likely see the new 9950X3D and 9900X3D landing on shelves as well.\n\nAs for Intel, it has been entirely incapable of answering AMD's 3D V-Cache technology \u2014 and for an extended period of time. I spoke with Intel about its plans at a separate roundtable.\n\n\"AMD has been executing with its stacked 3D V-Cache X3D processors for three generations now. They're integrating it into more and more products, bringing it to mobile, etc., and we expect that trend to continue,\" I said. \"Intel has really not responded to that at all, at least in any way that we can see from the outside looking in. That's effectively ceding that high-margin, premium-tier gaming segment to AMD wherever they choose to deploy that technology. What are you considering as a response to this?\" I asked.\n\n\"Our goal is that leadership product in every segment, and I'm not going to talk about unannounced products,\" replied Intel's Jim Johnson, Corporate VP and GM of Client Engineering.\n\nWith no official word on faster tech from Intel and no indications through leaks or other industry chatter that Intel has a new competing tech in the works, AMD will certainly continue to dominate the global gaming CPU market in 2025. For now, it is AMD's gaming world, and Intel is just living in it.",

Intel now offers a whole-vehicle platform, including high-performance compute, discrete graphics, artificial intelligence (AI), power management and zonal controller solutions alongside the Intel\u00ae Automotive Virtual Development Environment (VDE) co-developed with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Intel\u2019s approach addresses automakers\u2019 cost and performance scalability challenges, enabling faster, more efficient and more profitable SDV development and deployment.\n\n\u201c Intel automotive is bringing innovative solutions that reduce cost in the SDV revolution. Our whole-vehicle approach, combined with cloud integration, delivers a complete solution that drives down total cost of development and deployment while empowering automakers to build the future of mobility faster, more efficiently and more profitably.\u201d\n\n-- Jack Weast, Intel Fellow, vice president and general manager of Intel Automotive\n\nWhy a Whole-Vehicle Platform Matters: Intel\u2019s whole-vehicle platform reduces inefficiencies of traditional fragmented approaches to vehicle architectures. By optimizing the entire vehicle\u2019s electrical/electronic architecture, Intel drives significant cost reductions and performance improvements.\n\nSupporting this platform, Intel introduced the availability of the Adaptive Control Unit (ACU), designed for electric vehicle (EV) power trains and zonal controller applications.\n\nAbout the Adaptive Control Unit: The ACU U310 is a new kind of processing unit that supports the consolidation of multiple real-time, safety-critical and cybersecure functions, applications and domains (X-in-1) into a single chip. Traditional time and sequential processing-based micro and zonal controllers struggle to handle multiple workloads due to limited deterministic processing capabilities. In contrast, Intel\u2019s new family of ACU devices integrates a flexible logic area that offloads real-time control algorithms from the CPU cores, ensuring reliable performance, freedom from interference (FFI) and deterministic data delivery even when consolidating multiple microcontroller workloads into a single zonal MCU. This dual-brain approach enables greater workload consolidation, lowers cost, and enhances safety, cybersecurity and performance.\n\nWhen used in an electric vehicle power train, the ACU U310 supports advanced algorithmic solutions that reduce vehicle energy demand from the battery, automatically adapting high voltage and control frequencies to individual driver styles and road conditions. The ACU reduces cost per kilowatt and enhances energy efficiency, allowing the vehicle to reclaim up to 40 percent of the power train system energy losses, delivering a 3% to 5% efficiency boost during the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP). This translates to increased range, faster charging and a more responsive driving experience while significantly reducing per-vehicle bill of materials (BOM), electric motor size and battery costs compared to traditional approaches.\n\nStellantis Motorsports selected Intel as a key technology partner and adopting the Adaptive Control technology into its next-generation inverter control for enhanced performance and efficiency in competitive racing environments. In this implementation, the Intel technology will control the electric motor and recover energy during braking phases. The inverter plays a crucial role during a Formula E race, where any gain in efficiency is transformed into a precious competitive advantage.\n\nKarma Automotive announced support for Intel\u2019s ACU, showcasing an Intel co-branded inverter featuring Optimal Pulse Pattern control algorithms to improve efficiency and enable four unique driving profiles, including innovative features like Torque Ripple Reduction and Range Boost.\n\nThe ACU\u2019s programmability allows it to serve as a first-of-its-kind software-defined zonal controller, adapting to different vehicle topologies and applications. This flexibility streamlines the transition to software-defined vehicles, simplifies supply chains and reduces the complexity of the vehicle BOM.\n\nHow Next-Gen Architecture is Enhanced with AI Inside: Building on Intel\u2019s first-generation AI-enhanced SDV system-on-chips (SoCs), Intel announced the upcoming second-generation Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 B-series Graphics for Automotive set for production by the end of 2025.

            "content": "We were a little surprised in mid-September 2024 with the launch of the entry-level Intel RealSense Depth Module D421. With the recent financial turmoil and changes at the company, there was uncertainty whether Intel would continue to invest in the product line.\n\nWell, today The Robot Report learned more about the plans for the line of depth cameras. Intel is spinning out RealSense as an independent company. Intel said this will be done in the first half of 2025, with the new business being an Intel Capital portfolio company.\n\n\u201cAfter ten years of incubation, Intel is unleashing the potential of the Intel RealSense computer vision-AI portfolio in a standalone ICAP portfolio company by the first half of 2025,\u201d Intel said in a statement to The Robot Report. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring a smooth transition for our customers and continue to provide support throughout the process.\u201d\n\nIntel said spinning out RealSense is not a direct result of the company\u2019s recent financial struggles.\n\n\u201cIntel incubates leading-edge, disruptive technologies and businesses to validate customer need and market acceptance. At a certain level of scale, it makes sense for these businesses to operate outside of Intel, with the flexibility to operate in a way that the market demands and the ability to invest in key growth areas. This enables the spinout to make faster decisions, have greater customer solution flexibility, and remain nimble in competitive markets.\n\n\u201cNo. Intel is executing this spinout because we believe in the value of the company and are confident in its success as a standalone company. This decision aligns with our ongoing transformation and will help us further align to our strategic goal of focusing on our core businesses.\u201d\n\nIntel told The Robot Report that the new version of RealSense will maintain the same product roadmap, the same SKUs, and will continue providing the same support and level of service for its customers.\n\n\u201cThe new company will continue to develop AI-powered computer vision solutions and deliver current Intel RealSense portfolio and our committed roadmap, including RealSense depth cameras, facial authentication solutions, autonomous mobile robotic solutions, and physical therapy metrics. RealSense plans to expand its roadmap to include new innovations in stereo vision, robotics, and biometrics AI software and hardware.\u201d\n\nRealSense has always been a small part of Intel\u2019s business. It likely benefitted from the financial stability and extensive resources of Intel. Operating within a tech giant\u2019s ecosystem provided a safety net for R&D, as well as access to a vast network of industry partners.\n\nWill all that hold true as a standalone company? Will the new RealSense need to raise outside funding? We have lots of questions for Intel and are hoping to learn more soon.\n\nRegister now so you don't miss out!\n\nNew chapter for RealSense\n\nIntel RealSense depth cameras are a popular choice for developers of mobile robots and industrial pick-and-place robots. Intel details some robotics customers on its website.\n\nOne example is ANYbotics\u2018 ANYmal quadruped. According to Intel, each ANYmal robot has six Intel RealSense D435 modules that work together to create an elevation map that helps the robot navigate around a site and traverse difficult terrain, including climbing stairs.\n\nHow will this new independence affect the confidence of its current customers? We\u2019ll have to wait and see.\n\nWe do know this is yet another new chapter in what\u2019s been a three-and-a-half-year saga filled with twists and turns. In August 2021, Intel stunned the robotics industry by announcing it was shutting down RealSense to focus on core businesses. This even caught internal RealSense leaders by surprise at the time.\n\nHowever, Intel quickly reversed course, opting to keep RealSense alive but with a reduced lineup.\n\nThe robotics industry has long been riding a roller coaster when searching for low-cost, high-quality depth sensing. With RealSense spinning out as a standalone company, this narrative takes another surprising turn. RealSense is freed from Intel\u2019s restructuring priorities, but independence will most certainly introduce new challenges.\n\nThis certainly isn\u2019t Intel\u2019s first time spinning off a company. In December 2024, after facing declining revenue, Intel said it could spin off its foundry business.\n\nMobileye, an autonomous vehicle developer, spun off from Intel in October 2022. Intel had acquired Mobileye in 2017 for $15.3 billion, and at the time, it was the largest acquisition ever of an Israeli company. Mobileye was founded in 1999.\n\nIntel began producing depth-sensing products under its Perceptual Computing division in 2013. Intel rebranded this group as Intel RealSense in 2014.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This article was updated at 9:26 AM EST on Jan. 9, 2025 with new quotes from Intel about the decision to spin off RealSense and the future product roadmap. It also corrected an error that said Intel had spun off its foundry business. Intel did not spin off the foundry business, but has considered doing so.",

This works with Native ASMP and reduces idle power consumption.\"\n\nIntel software engineers this week sent out two pull requests landing more of their final kernel graphics driver feature changes destined for the upcoming Linux 6.14 kernel.The feature cut-off of new material for Linux 6.14 by way of DRM-Next is quickly drawing to an end while on Tuesday were new Intel pull requests with some remaining code that was worked out and passed testing over the holidays.First up is a new drm-xe-next pull request. Arguably most notable there is adding UHBR rates for Thunderbolt. This is the Ultra-High Bit Rate (UHBR) mode for DisplayPort with Thunderbolt in Alt-Mode. The Intel Linux kernel graphics driver was missing the UHBR modes for 10G and 20G modes. UHBR 10 allows for 40 Gbps bandwidth and UHBR 20 at 80 Gbps.The Intel Linux driver patch adding the UHBR rates for the Thunderbolt alt-mode make mention these UHBR rates are only supported for Panther Lake \"PTL\" and newer platforms. So with next-gen Panther Lake systems featuring Xe3 integrated graphics you can look forward to UHBR 10 and UHBR 20 support.The other drm-xe-next highlights from this week's pull include:Sent out yesterday was also a new drm-intel-next pull request ahead of Linux 6.14. That batch of Intel driver changes for Linux 6.14 noted \"an active display round with some big series, but nothing extraordinary.\" Included were:Of that pull, the DG2/Alchemist refactoring to fix DG2 bugs with certain CPUs may be of interest to some Phoronix readers... The commit message for the Intel \"Wa_14022698537\" workaround explains:The whitelisted CPUs are Intel CPUs of Alder Lake, Comet Lake, Kabylake, Raptor Lake, and Rocket Lake generations.\n\nSo those with some older Intel CPUs will now be able to enjoy lower CPU power consumption with DG2/Alchemist graphics cards thanks to the workaround/fixes but notable is the latest Arrow Lake generation processors not being listed here. No AMD CPUs are whitelisted either for being able to benefit from this lower DG2/Alchemist graphics card power consumption.\n\nIn any event it will be interesting to test these latest Intel Linux graphics driver changes once the Linux 6.14 kernel begins taking shape in a few weeks. The merge window should open in late January and the stable kernel out in March ahead of appearing in the likes of Fedora 42 and Ubuntu 25.04 this spring.",

The ACU U310 is a new kind of processing unit that supports the consolidation of multiple real-time, safety-critical and cybersecure functions, applications and domains (X-in-1) into a single chip. (Credit: Intel Corporation)\n\nThe updated release reads:\n\nINTEL ACCELERATES SOFTWARE-DEFINED INNOVATION WITH WHOLE-VEHICLE APPROACH\n\nAt CES 2025, Intel unveils new adaptive control solution, next-gen discrete graphics and AWS virtual development environment.\n\nWhat\u2019s New: At CES, Intel unveiled an expanded product portfolio and new partnerships designed to accelerate automakers\u2019 transitions to electric and software-defined vehicles (SDVs). Intel now offers a whole-vehicle platform, including high-performance compute, discrete graphics, artificial intelligence (AI), power management and zonal controller solutions alongside the Intel\u00ae Automotive Virtual Development Environment (VDE) co-developed with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Intel\u2019s approach addresses automakers\u2019 cost and performance scalability challenges, enabling faster, more efficient and more profitable SDV development and deployment.\n\n\u201cIntel automotive is bringing innovative solutions that reduce cost in the SDV revolution. Our whole-vehicle approach, combined with cloud integration, delivers a complete solution that drives down total cost of development and deployment while empowering automakers to build the future of mobility faster, more efficiently and more profitably.\u201d\n\n-- Jack Weast, Intel Fellow, vice president and general manager of Intel Automotive\n\nWhy a Whole-Vehicle Platform Matters: Intel\u2019s whole-vehicle platform reduces inefficiencies of traditional fragmented approaches to vehicle architectures. By optimizing the entire vehicle\u2019s electrical/electronic architecture, Intel drives significant cost reductions and performance improvements.\n\nSupporting this platform, Intel introduced the availability of the Adaptive Control Unit (ACU), designed for electric vehicle (EV) power trains and zonal controller applications.\n\nAbout the Adaptive Control Unit: The ACU U310 is a new kind of processing unit that supports the consolidation of multiple real-time, safety-critical and cybersecure functions, applications and domains (X-in-1) into a single chip. Traditional time and sequential processing-based micro and zonal controllers struggle to handle multiple workloads due to limited deterministic processing capabilities. In contrast, Intel\u2019s new family of ACU devices integrates a flexible logic area that offloads real-time control algorithms from the CPU cores, ensuring reliable performance, freedom from interference (FFI) and deterministic data delivery even when consolidating multiple microcontroller workloads into a single zonal MCU. This dual-brain approach enables greater workload consolidation, lowers cost, and enhances safety, cybersecurity and performance.\n\nWhen used in an electric vehicle power train, the ACU U310 supports advanced algorithmic solutions that reduce vehicle energy demand from the battery, automatically adapting high voltage and control frequencies to individual driver styles and road conditions. The ACU reduces cost per kilowatt and enhances energy efficiency, allowing the vehicle to reclaim up to 40 percent of the power train system energy losses, delivering a 3% to 5% efficiency boost during the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP). This translates to increased range, faster charging and a more responsive driving experience while significantly reducing per-vehicle bill of materials (BOM), electric motor size and battery costs compared to traditional approaches.\n\nStellantis Motorsports selected Intel as a key technology partner and adopting the Adaptive Control technology into its next-generation inverter control for enhanced performance and efficiency in competitive racing environments. In this implementation, the Intel technology will control the electric motor and recover energy during braking phases. The inverter plays a crucial role during a Formula E race, where any gain in efficiency is transformed into a precious competitive advantage.\n\nKarma Automotive announced support for Intel\u2019s ACU, showcasing an Intel co-branded inverter featuring Optimal Pulse Pattern control algorithms to improve efficiency and enable four unique driving profiles, including innovative features like Torque Ripple Reduction and Range Boost.\n\nThe ACU\u2019s programmability allows it to serve as a first-of-its-kind software-defined zonal controller, adapting to different vehicle topologies and applications. This flexibility streamlines the transition to software-defined vehicles, simplifies supply chains and reduces the complexity of the vehicle BOM.\n\nHow Next-Gen Architecture is Enhanced with AI Inside: Building on Intel\u2019s first-generation AI-enhanced SDV system-on-chips (SoCs), Intel announced the upcoming second-generation Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 B-series Graphics for Automotive set for production by the end of 2025. This solution provides the high-performance compute needed for more advanced in-vehicle AI workloads, next-generation human-machine interface (HMI) engines, and immersive in-vehicle experiences and AAA PC gaming. Paired with an Intel AI-enhanced SDV SoC, it delivers scalable performance for complex AI tasks, supported by the vast Intel AI ecosystem.\n\nHow Intel and AWS Revolutionize Automotive Software Development: Intel and AWS introduced the Intel Automotive Virtual Development Environment on AWS, a groundbreaking approach that ensures true hardware and software parity from cloud to car. This new offering addresses challenges throughout the vehicle development life cycle, enabling engineers to seamlessly switch between virtual and physical hardware setups. It integrates Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae processor-based Amazon EC2 instances and, for the first time, incorporates Intel\u2019s Automotive SDV SoCs within the AWS environment, eliminating the need for expensive electronic control unit (ECU) simulators or developer boards. This collaboration provides a unified solution that accelerates innovation, reduces R&D costs and speeds time-to-market.\n\nAbout Intel\u2019s System-Level Advantage: Intel's whole-vehicle approach delivers numerous benefits to automakers, including cost reductions, enhanced vehicle performance, streamlined development, improved energy efficiency, seamless AI integration and faster time-to-market \u2013 all supported by Intel\u2019s globally balanced supply chain.\n\nMore: Intel at CES 2025 | Intel Auto Keynote Explores Software-Defined Future (Video)\n\nAbout Intel\n\nIntel (Nasdaq: INTC) is an industry leader, creating world-changing technology that enables global progress and enriches lives.

            "content": "Founded in 1968, Intel\u2014the world\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer by sales for decades\u2014has faced challenges in more recent years. Although it remains a leading manufacturer of semiconductors and central processing units worldwide, the company\u2019s disappointing financial performance this past year led it to announce 15,000 layoffs in 2024\u2014more than 15% of its global workforce. That put a lot on the shoulders of the company\u2019s executive vice president and chief people officer, Christy Pambianchi.\n\nYet Pambianchi, who joined Intel in August 2021 and heads an HR team of approximately 1,250 employees, speaks about recent times at Intel in hopeful terms. \u201cI\u2019m so excited we\u2019re having a vibrant and active dialogue again about how important the manufacturing sector is in the economy,\u201d she says.\n\nPambianchi touts the well-paying jobs provided by the manufacturing sector, in which she has worked for most of her 35-year career. \u201cThere is nothing I love more than opening a factory,\u201d she adds. \u201cI love bringing good, high-paying jobs into communities.\u201d\n\nStill, Pambianchi has led Intel\u2019s people function during undoubtedly challenging times. \u201cChristy has had to help navigate significant changes in leadership and strategic direction while keeping the wheels on,\u201d says Kevin M. Close, corporate vice president of total rewards at Intel.\n\nThe company had \u201ca tremendous growth in employee population\u201d in 2021 and 2022, Close says, but in late 2022, it announced several rounds of layoffs. In 2023, Intel implemented austerity measures, such as reducing salaries for executives, suspending both merit raises and bonuses, and slashing the 401(k) match for lower-level employees.\n\nPambianchi has shepherded Intel\u2019s HR function through this turbulent time, Close says, by \u201cleading with decisive actions and clear communications.\u201d At Intel, and throughout her career, Pambianchi says she has navigated times of change by staying focused on business strategy and aligning the HR function with it.\n\n\u201cEverything Christy does is clearly aligned with our strategy,\u201d says April Miller Boise, executive vice president and chief legal officer at Intel. \u201cAs a general matter, I haven\u2019t seen other HR leaders operate at that same level of strategic recognition and alignment.\u201d\n\nPambianchi gained her appreciation for strategic alignment after she joined PepsiCo in 1990\u2014her first HR job and first experience with a company transformation. She recalls that Brenda Barnes, Pepsi-Cola North America\u2019s chief operating officer at the time, created a transformation initiative that turned the company\u2019s organizational chart upside down\u2014placing leaders at the bottom and front-line workers at the top.\n\nFor Pambianchi, the organization\u2019s adoption of a servant-leadership model was a lightbulb moment. \u201cThat stuck with me over the course of my career,\u201d she recalls. After 10 years at PepsiCo, Pambianchi carried the servant-leadership approach with her to Corning, where she worked for about two decades; to Verizon, where she was the CHRO for more than two years; and now to Intel.\n\nAs part of its new strategy to surpass its competitors, Intel has recommitted to its core values, Pambianchi says, by re-embracing objectives and key results (OKRs)\u2014a framework first developed at Intel in the 1970s that emphasizes clearly defined goals and measurable results.\n\n\u201cWe reinstated the entire underpinning of the OKR process, cascading from the company strategy all the way to individual objectives,\u201d Pambianchi explains. To that end, compensation is now tied to employees\u2019 ability to help realize the OKRs that Intel spells out.\n\nDriving Change in HR\n\nBy overhauling Intel\u2019s HR department, Pambianchi helped the company change direction in its people management practices. When she joined Intel, she encountered \u201cvery, very siloed\u201d HR functions. In its place, Pambianchi implemented a structure she developed in her previous HR leadership roles in which department generalists and specialists closely collaborate.\n\nWhile it\u2019s the job of HR generalists to have a strong grasp of a company\u2019s overall business strategy and the hiring needs of each department, it\u2019s impractical for each employee to be an expert in all of the HR functions at a company of Intel\u2019s scale, Pambianchi says. That\u2019s why she implemented HR centers of excellence. These centers comprise HR specialists who are subject-matter experts with deep knowledge in cross-departmental areas such as talent acquisition, employee relations, compensation, and diversity. \u201cThey have to be the best in the world at what they do,\u201d Pambianchi says.\n\nShe also put in place programs to help realize what her company refers to as \u201cIDM (integrated device manufacturing) 2.0,\u201d which was former CEO Pat Gelsinger\u2019s vision for expanding Intel\u2019s manufacturing business. To help meet the manufacturer\u2019s talent needs by promoting internally, Pambianchi in 2021 launched a two-year effort to build a career-planning platform for employees that replaced outdated job summaries. Previously, employees had little visibility into the opportunities they could pursue across the enterprise or even within their own departments. Now, employees seeking new positions can access the platform at any time and view all internal jobs available to them. Soon, the platform will leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to suggest to individual employees the jobs that might be of interest to them.\n\nPambianchi says this function of AI is just one of many that will transform HR in the years to come. \u201cMy advice to HR professionals is to run toward [AI], not away from it,\u201d she says. \u201cFigure out how the technology can allow you to do your work better.\u201d\n\nPambianchi has tasked her team members with creating an AI road map for Intel\u2019s HR department. They conduct focus groups with HR employees around the world who experiment with AI to identify the technology\u2019s \u201clow-hanging fruit,\u201d she explains. For example, some employees are experimenting with using AI to collect and summarize copious amounts of people data\u2014such as thousands of comments on employee experience surveys\u2014to free up time for HR employees to concentrate on higher-level analyses.\n\nPambianchi is also helping Intel become a diversity leader in the industry. While women currently make up approximately 25% of Intel\u2019s technical staff, the company aims to have more than 40% of its technical roles filled by women by the end of this decade. In another effort to cultivate a more diverse workforce, the company offers a program at community colleges called Quick Start, a 10-day simulation of a technician\u2019s role at Intel to give students a sense of what the job is like.\n\n\u201cWe know that groupthink kills innovation,\u201d Pambianchi explains. \u201cSo, to be successful, we need to have diversity of thought and inclusive teams that can helpfully debate and push forward breakthrough innovation.\u201d\n\nGrowing Up Fast\n\nPambianchi credits some of her professional success to a childhood that forced her to grow up and mature quickly. When she was 11 years old, her mother was killed in a car accident. As the eldest of four girls, Pambianchi suddenly had to shoulder an enormous weight for her family.\n\n\u201cMy dad really struggled and relied on me a lot, and so did my sisters,\u201d recalls Pambianchi, who grew up in Brewster, N.Y. \u201cIt was a very, very challenging time, and I became an adult really fast.\u201d\n\nCharacteristically, when Pambianchi discusses this time in her life, she describes not just what she lost, but also what she gained.\n\n\u201cWhen you experience loss that dramatically at a really young age, and you don\u2019t have any warning or planning, you go from \u2018Everything is stable and great\u2019 in your life to \u2018Everything is upside-down,\u2019 \u201d she explains. \u201cSo, I became someone who seeks to make order out of chaos. I like systems and processes. The other thing is, you realize how every single day is a gift and you might not have it tomorrow.\u201d The early loss also left Pambianchi \u201csuper resilient,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter her mother\u2019s death, Pambianchi\u2019s aunt and grandmother moved in with the family, and her grandmother didn\u2019t let the sisters dwell on what they had lost. \u201cIf we were feeling down, she would remind us there were so many reasons to be satisfied and happy,\u201d Pambianchi remembers, adding another upside of this period. \u201cIt was a household of six women and my dad, so the idea that women couldn\u2019t do everything a man could do never crossed our minds at all.\u201d\n\nDuring her high school and college years, Pambianchi\u2019s future HR career began to take shape. In the 1980s, she saw how her father\u2019s and other family members\u2019 professional lives were upended after the government broke up their employer, AT&T, and this inspired her to study labor relations at Cornell University.\n\n\u201cI realized through studying labor history and seeing what happened in my family that the work you do re- ally shapes everything in your life\u2014where you live, what schools your kids go to, what social mobility you have,\u201d she says. This led Pambianchi to her career choice. \u201cI wanted to work on the world of work,\u201d she says. \u201cHow are people satisfied in their job? Does it have meaning to them?\u201d\n\nWhile at Cornell, Pambianchi worked in the dining hall, sometimes alongside fellow crew members and sometimes as their supervisor. \u201cI adopted the belief that people need leaders who enable them to be successful,\u201d she says. During an HR internship at General Electric during her junior year, Pambianchi realized she\u2019d found her profession.\n\nToday, Pambianchi, like her own mother, has four children. \u201cMy No. 1 job is to be the mom,\u201d she says. \u201cI want my kids to have what I didn\u2019t get.\u201d\n\nAt her other job\u2014the one at Intel\u2014Pambianchi says she continues to hone the leadership and skills she learned early in life.\n\n\u201cChristy never shies away from a leadership moment; she is a warrior,\u201d Close says. \u201cIn the most challenging of times, that\u2019s when Christy is at her best. She understands what it takes to lead others through that moment.\u201d\n\nNovid Parsi is a freelance writer based in St. Louis.",

            "content": "When the third quarter of 2024 ended, Intel had lost a substantial 5.7% PC market share to its rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). This was the largest market share gain for AMD in the last 10 years and underscored Intel\u2019s basic problem: Its rival has been chipping away at its market share as the company struggles to innovate.\n\nDespite the above, Intel still enjoys a 71.3% market share! The problem, however, is that the market is shrinking. Data centers continue to shift from CPUs to GPUs, and Intel hardly has a GPU market share. So it continues to do what it can to salvage the CPU market.\n\nIntel Corporation (INTC): CEO Departure and Market Reactions\n\nAt the CES 2025, the company launched its Core Ultra 200HX series for gaming laptops. These are meant to help gamers enjoy an immersive experience thanks to AI acceleration. AI acceleration helps reduce power consumption and latency, improving speed and resulting in a much better gaming experience.\n\nAccording to the chipmaker, the Intel Core Ultra 200HX will be the first AI CPU with a built-in Neural Processing Unit (NPU). The NPU is what helps perform the computations required for AI tasks. In 2025, we can expect the company to build on this launch, as it attempts to secure its market dominance in the AI PC segment. The launch of the CPU was also accompanied by the H series mobile processors, which offer similar improvements and efficiencies.\n\nIntel continues to lose revenue and these processors are an attempt at rescuing the trend of customers leaving the company. The PC market domination is currently supported by big corporations that have embedded Intel in their infrastructure. The switching cost for them can often be high, which is why they continue to use Intel even if AMD beats the company's CPUs on certain benchmarks. If one day the big clients decide to move on, Intel would find it impossible to recover. Last month\u2019s resignation of CEO Pat Gelisnger shows that the plan to regain the company\u2019s old aura wasn\u2019t working. Gelsinger was at the helm of affairs for three years, a period the board thought was enough to start seeing results. Intel rivals Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are closing in on all-time highs, so the sad state of affairs for Intel continues and investors may want to wait more to see if the new product launches are really any different from the previous ones in terms of bringing in more revenue.\n\nIntel is not on our latest list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 68 hedge fund portfolios held INTC at the end of the third quarter which was 75 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of INTC as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The NPUs in those devices reach 48 TOPS.\n\nIntel\u2019s announcement of the new Arrow Lake kit nonetheless claimed the Lunar Lake kit, aka the Core Ultra 200V, demonstrate its leadership \u2013 in part because they include an updated version of the vPro security and management features the company recommends to business PC buyers. But that vPro upgrade was announced last February.\n\nThe new H Series Arrow Lake processors detailed below fall well short of the 48 TOPS mark.\n\nIntel Arrow Lake H series Cores L3 Cache TDP Base Clock Max Boost Availability Ultra 9 258H 16 24MB 45W-115W 2.9GHz 5.4GHz February 2025 Ultra 7 265H 16 24MB 28W-60W 2.2GHz 5.3GHz February 2025 Ultra 7 255H 16 24MB 28W-60W 2.0GHz 5.1GHz February 2025 Ultra 5 235H 14 18MB 28W-60W 2.4GHz 5.0GHz February 2025 Ultra 5 225H 14 18MB 28W-60W 1.7GHz 4.9GHz February 2025\n\nThe U series Arrow Lake silicon includes the following models.\n\nIntel Arrow Lake U Series Cores L3 Cache TDP Base Clock Max Boost Availability Ultra 7 265U 12 12MB 15W-57W 2.1GHz 5.3GHz February 2025 Ultra 7 255U 12 12MB 15W-57W 2.0GHz 5.2GHz February 2025 Ultra 5 235U 12 12MB 15W-57W 2.0GHz 4.9GHz February 2025 Ultra 5 225U 12 12MB 15W-57W 1.5GHz 4.8GHz February 2025\n\nDesktops and edges\n\nAlongside its announcement of laptop parts that lack an edge, Intel announced products for the desktop and the edge.\n\nThe desktop products are new members of the Core Ultra 200S series, which now includes a dozen 65-watt and 35-watt offerings for mainstream desktop users. Intel's product brief [PDF] doesn\u2019t list the new models but suggests they'll do well in educational, retail, healthcare, and manufacturing environments.\n\nFor less demanding workloads, Intel also announced a pair of new Core 3 processors and the same number of plain vanilla Intel Processors \u2013 aka Twin Lake \u2013 aimed at low-end laptops and low-power embedded devices and which improve on the clock speeds offered in Alder Lake by a couple of hundred megahertz.\n\nIntel hasn\u2019t claimed those products are market leaders. It has claimed products built on its 18A process, which is roughly equivalent to what rival foundries would describe as a 1.8 nanometer process, will represent a new level of chipmaking sophistication.\n\nThe chipmaker's CES announcement revealed its already produced sample products made with 18A and plans \"volume production in the second half of 2025.\"\n\nThe company is yet to detail performance of those products, but perhaps by CES 2026 they\u2019ll make its claims of leadership more credible. \u00ae",

            "content": "The last two laptop central processing unit (CPU) families to come from Intel (INTC 1.05%) were more focused on efficiency and AI capabilities than raw performance. Intel launched Meteor Lake in late 2023, which moved to a tile-based architecture and used the Intel 4 manufacturing process for the compute tile. Meteor Lake delivered solid efficiency gains and graphics performance, but performance regressed in other areas compared to older chips.\n\nIntel followed up Meteor Lake with Lunar Lake in the latter half of 2024. Lunar Lake went all-in on efficiency, taking advantage of an external manufacturing process from TSMC and moving the memory on-chip. Lunar Lake laptops boast impressive battery life, making the chip family the perfect counter to Qualcomm's efficient Arm-based PC chips. Like Meteor Lake, though, Lunar Lake was not focused on raw performance.\n\nBringing Arrow Lake to laptops\n\nIntel launched its Arrow Lake desktop CPUs in late 2024. Like Lunar Lake, Arrow Lake outsourced manufacturing to TSMC after switching from the canceled Intel 20A process. Compared to the last-generation Raptor Lake Refresh desktop chips, Arrow Lake chips delivered large gains in energy efficiency and performance across many productivity workloads. Unfortunately, the chips initially exhibited erratic behavior in gaming workloads that led to subpar reviews.\n\nIntel has been rolling out software fixes that should improve the gaming situation just in time for the launch of the laptop variants of the Arrow Lake family. Intel announced a slew of new laptop chips at CES 2025 with a complicated lineup that spans multiple architectures. The Core Ultra 200H and Core Ultra 200HX families are both Arrow Lake-based and bring the performance and efficiency improvements of Arrow Lake to laptops.\n\nWhile Lunar Lake maxed out at 8 cores, with a mix of performance and efficiency cores, these Arrow Lake laptop chips sport as many as 24 cores. The top-tier 200HX model comes with 8 performance cores and 16 efficiency cores, a setup that should deliver solid single-thread and multi-threaded performance. Importantly, these Arrow Lake chips should also be far more energy efficient than older Raptor Lake laptop chips.\n\nBeating back AMD\n\nIntel has been steadily losing share in the PC CPU market to Advanced Micro Devices over much of the past decade. In the laptop CPU market, Intel still held a 77.7% unit market share in the second quarter of 2024. However, that's down from more than 90% in 2016.\n\nIntel's new Arrow Lake laptop chips should improve the company's competitive positioning in the enthusiast and gaming portions of the laptop markets. Lunar Lake does a good job addressing the thin and light portion of the market, and it makes Qualcomm's Arm-based chips less attractive, especially considering Qualcomm laptops suffer from some compatibility issues. For mainstream and performance laptops, Raptor Lake is power hungry and suffered from embarrassing stability problems that likely drove some laptop buyers to AMD. Intel's new Arrow Lake chips should right both wrongs.\n\nThe PC market isn't particularly strong right now, although Windows 10 will reach the end of support in October 2025. Since Windows 11 requires fairly modern hardware, this could trigger a flood of new laptop purchases, especially among businesses. With Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake laptops available to start 2025, and with Panther Lake coming in the second half of the year built on the Intel 18A process, Intel should be in a good position to reap the benefits of any upgrade cycle.\n\nIntel faces tough competition from AMD, but its new Arrow Lake laptop chips could help it regain some lost market share, or at the very least hold the line as it pushes its manufacturing roadmap forward.",

First paragraph, second sentence should read: Intel\u00ae Automotive Virtual Development Environment (VDE) (instead of Intel\u00ae Automotive Virtual Design Environment (VDE)).\n\nAt CES on Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2025, Intel introduced the availability of the Adaptive Control Unit (ACU), designed for electric vehicle (EV) power trains and zonal controller applications. The ACU U310 is a new kind of processing unit that supports the consolidation of multiple real-time, safety-critical and cybersecure functions, applications and domains (X-in-1) into a single chip. (Credit: Intel Corporation)\n\nThe updated release reads:\n\nINTEL ACCELERATES SOFTWARE-DEFINED INNOVATION WITH WHOLE-VEHICLE APPROACH\n\nAt CES 2025, Intel unveils new adaptive control solution, next-gen discrete graphics and AWS virtual development environment.\n\nWhat\u2019s New: At CES, Intel unveiled an expanded product portfolio and new partnerships designed to accelerate automakers\u2019 transitions to electric and software-defined vehicles (SDVs). Intel now offers a whole-vehicle platform, including high-performance compute, discrete graphics, artificial intelligence (AI), power management and zonal controller solutions alongside the Intel\u00ae Automotive Virtual Development Environment (VDE) co-developed with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Intel\u2019s approach addresses automakers\u2019 cost and performance scalability challenges, enabling faster, more efficient and more profitable SDV development and deployment.\n\n\u201cIntel automotive is bringing innovative solutions that reduce cost in the SDV revolution. Our whole-vehicle approach, combined with cloud integration, delivers a complete solution that drives down total cost of development and deployment while empowering automakers to build the future of mobility faster, more efficiently and more profitably.\u201d\n\n-- Jack Weast, Intel Fellow, vice president and general manager of Intel Automotive\n\nWhy a Whole-Vehicle Platform Matters: Intel\u2019s whole-vehicle platform reduces inefficiencies of traditional fragmented approaches to vehicle architectures. By optimizing the entire vehicle\u2019s electrical/electronic architecture, Intel drives significant cost reductions and performance improvements.\n\nSupporting this platform, Intel introduced the availability of the Adaptive Control Unit (ACU), designed for electric vehicle (EV) power trains and zonal controller applications.\n\nAbout the Adaptive Control Unit: The ACU U310 is a new kind of processing unit that supports the consolidation of multiple real-time, safety-critical and cybersecure functions, applications and domains (X-in-1) into a single chip. Traditional time and sequential processing-based micro and zonal controllers struggle to handle multiple workloads due to limited deterministic processing capabilities. In contrast, Intel\u2019s new family of ACU devices integrates a flexible logic area that offloads real-time control algorithms from the CPU cores, ensuring reliable performance, freedom from interference (FFI) and deterministic data delivery even when consolidating multiple microcontroller workloads into a single zonal MCU. This dual-brain approach enables greater workload consolidation, lowers cost, and enhances safety, cybersecurity and performance.\n\nWhen used in an electric vehicle power train, the ACU U310 supports advanced algorithmic solutions that reduce vehicle energy demand from the battery, automatically adapting high voltage and control frequencies to individual driver styles and road conditions. The ACU reduces cost per kilowatt and enhances energy efficiency, allowing the vehicle to reclaim up to 40 percent of the power train system energy losses, delivering a 3% to 5% efficiency boost during the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP). This translates to increased range, faster charging and a more responsive driving experience while significantly reducing per-vehicle bill of materials (BOM), electric motor size and battery costs compared to traditional approaches.\n\nStellantis Motorsports selected Intel as a key technology partner and adopting the Adaptive Control technology into its next-generation inverter control for enhanced performance and efficiency in competitive racing environments. In this implementation, the Intel technology will control the electric motor and recover energy during braking phases. The inverter plays a crucial role during a Formula E race, where any gain in efficiency is transformed into a precious competitive advantage.\n\nKarma Automotive announced support for Intel\u2019s ACU, showcasing an Intel co-branded inverter featuring Optimal Pulse Pattern control algorithms to improve efficiency and enable four unique driving profiles, including innovative features like Torque Ripple Reduction and Range Boost.\n\nThe ACU\u2019s programmability allows it to serve as a first-of-its-kind software-defined zonal controller, adapting to different vehicle topologies and applications. This flexibility streamlines the transition to software-defined vehicles, simplifies supply chains and reduces the complexity of the vehicle BOM.\n\nHow Next-Gen Architecture is Enhanced with AI Inside: Building on Intel\u2019s first-generation AI-enhanced SDV system-on-chips (SoCs), Intel announced the upcoming second-generation Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 B-series Graphics for Automotive set for production by the end of 2025. This solution provides the high-performance compute needed for more advanced in-vehicle AI workloads, next-generation human-machine interface (HMI) engines, and immersive in-vehicle experiences and AAA PC gaming. Paired with an Intel AI-enhanced SDV SoC, it delivers scalable performance for complex AI tasks, supported by the vast Intel AI ecosystem.\n\nHow Intel and AWS Revolutionize Automotive Software Development: Intel and AWS introduced the Intel Automotive Virtual Development Environment on AWS, a groundbreaking approach that ensures true hardware and software parity from cloud to car. This new offering addresses challenges throughout the vehicle development life cycle, enabling engineers to seamlessly switch between virtual and physical hardware setups. It integrates Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae processor-based Amazon EC2 instances and, for the first time, incorporates Intel\u2019s Automotive SDV SoCs within the AWS environment, eliminating the need for expensive electronic control unit (ECU) simulators or developer boards. This collaboration provides a unified solution that accelerates innovation, reduces R&D costs and speeds time-to-market.\n\nAbout Intel\u2019s System-Level Advantage: Intel's whole-vehicle approach delivers numerous benefits to automakers, including cost reductions, enhanced vehicle performance, streamlined development, improved energy efficiency, seamless AI integration and faster time-to-market \u2013 all supported by Intel\u2019s globally balanced supply chain.\n\nMore: Intel at CES 2025 | Intel Auto Keynote Explores Software-Defined Future (Video)\n\nAbout Intel\n\nIntel (Nasdaq: INTC) is an industry leader, creating world-changing technology that enables global progress and enriches lives.

Top: Michelle Johnston Holthaus at CES 2025.\n\nIt's been a consistent refrain even before the \"Arc\" branding was announced: \"Intel is going to exit the GPU market!\" For whatever reason, there are certain people who really don't want Intel to be making GPUs, and anytime there is even the smallest hint of bad news for Intel GPUs, this old line comes up again.The thing is, Intel's GPUs are doing better than ever right now. The company can't keep the excellent Arc B580 in stock, and it's about to launch the 10GB B570 next week. We haven't posted our impressions of the B570 yet as it isn't technically launched, but we were over the moon with the B580 considering its price. It's not flawless, but it's very, very good, and if you're in the market for an entry-level GPU, at this time, there's not really much else worth considering.In case you still aren't convinced, how about Interim Co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus telling you that Intel's discrete GPUs aren't going anywhere? During the blue team's CES 2025 keynote , Holthaus specifically said exactly that: \"We are very committed to the discrete graphics market, and plan future investments.\" Pretty open-and-shut, isn't it?It really shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that's paying attention, though. Intel needs graphics IP no matter what, and if the company can make money soldering GPUs to graphics cards, that also benefits its cash cow datacenter market, as it builds out the company's portfolio that it can offer to enterprise customers. Besides graphics duties, GPU hardware includes video processing blocks that are useful for video streaming services, and AI accelerators are close cousins to GPUs\u2014just ask rival NVIDIA.In a more practical and direct context, our curiosity is whether Intel will launch new discrete GPUs based on the Xe2 IP. There have been persistent rumors about a larger Battlemage GPU, perhaps named B770 or similar. Such a card could be a compelling offering, but it depends on how well it would compete against not only NVIDIA's just-announced GeForce RTX 5070 at $549 , but also AMD's forthcoming Radeon RX 9070. Either way, we're heartened to hear Holthaus confirm Intel's commitment to dedicated GPUs.",

            "content": "I was going to write up Intel's CES 2025 announcements with a list of my takeaways. But it turns out I only really have a single thought about the raft of new mobile processors, led by its Arrow Lake-architecture 200HX and 200H series, at least until we can test them to attain clarity: WTF?\n\nThe fragmentation of the lines between gaming/creating and the rest isn't new, nor is the AI performance versus everything else. Or business versus consumer. But Intel typically launches them separately any time of the year that is not CES; for instance, the AI-flagship Core Ultra 200V series (Lunar Lake architecture) in September 2024 or the desktop gaming flagship Core Ultra 200S series (Arrow Lake architecture) in October.\n\nAs usual, though, at CES Intel announced a mix of processor lines, which really drove home the increasing fragmentation between the AI-optimized chips and the rest. I expect it all to normalize within the next few years as we stop thinking of AI as separate from the rest of the capabilities the way we eventually stopped thinking of a \"multimedia PC\" as a singular type of system over 25 years ago.\n\nBut the interim remains confusing and isn't helped by Intel's calling any chip with an NPU an \"AI PC,\" even if the NPU is barely useful. The hardware demands and use cases of AI have spiked significantly in the year since Intel launched its Meteor Lake processors (the Core Ultra 100 series) at an event where it popularized \"AI PC\" -- and the Arrow Lake NPU performs only slightly better than that Meteor Lake NPU. Even if you take into account the AI performance of the sum of its silicon parts (the metric referred to as \"platform TOPS,\" which combines the theoretical performance of the CPU, GPU and NPU).\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra H series die. Intel/CNET\n\nIntel noted that laptops with the 200V series chips and prebuilt desktops with the 200S chips will be shipping before March.\n\nIntel also made a slew of business-slash-commercial chip announcements plus a ton of no-AI-support-at-all Core 200-series processors, all with the expected hard sell on why your business needs chips with AI support.\n\nWatch this: CNET's Best Laptops of 2024 02:37\n\nWhere confusion reigns\n\nThe HX series has long been Intel's flagship creating-and-gaming mobile CPU, but it's always lagged a generation in core technologies and has also always been intended to work with a discrete GPU -- a separate graphics chip from Nvidia or Intel -- so Intel never bothers putting its latest graphics technology in this class of processors.\n\nBut now, in addition to the modest integrated graphics in the new generation of 200HX series mobile CPUs, it also has the anemic last-gen 13.1 TOPS NPU as well, just like the Arrow Lake desktop CPUs. Sure, you can get much better generative AI performance out of a good discrete GPU, but the meh NPU brings the overall platform performance down compared to what it might have been -- it goes only as high as a total of 36 platform TOPS, which could potentially affect things like heavy mixed video workloads (like streaming while using gen AI). And even these systems may turn off the discrete GPU when on battery, so you'd end up stuck at the lower performance level for AI.\n\nCore Ultra 200HX series\n\nP-Cores/Max boost (GHz) E-cores/Max boost (GHz) NPU performance Power class (base/boost, watts) GPU cores GPU max boost (GHz) Core Ultra 9 285HX 8/5.5 16/2.8 13 TOPS 15W-57W 4 Xe 2 Core Ultra 9 275HX 8/5.4 16/2.7 13 TOPS 15W-57W 4 Xe 1.9 Core Ultra 7 265HX 8/5.3 12/2.6 13 TOPS 15W-57W 4 Xe 1.9 Core Ultra 7 255HX 8/5.2 12/2.4 13 TOPS 15W-57W 4 Xe 1.85 Core Ultra 5 245HX 6/5.1 8/3.1 13 TOPS 15W-57W 3 Xe 1.9 Core Ultra 5 235HX 6/5.1 8/2.9 13 TOPS 15W-57W 3 Xe 1.8\n\nThe new HX chips have a much lower maximum power draw than their 14th-gen predecessors, maxing out at 57W, which targets them at thinner, more power efficient but still enthusiast-centric laptops. This is a notable switch from what what was almost universally considered a \"desktop chip for mobile.\" On the flipside, the V series' integrated GPU performs like \"discrete-level graphics\" (which is a terrible and confusing way to put it), and those chips don't seem to support discrete GPUs; that's essentially a chip intended to compete with the Apple M4 Pro. So which would you want?\n\nThat brings me to the 200H series (Arrow Lake-H), the traditional thin, light and optional-discrete-graphics chip line. It has the weak NPU of the HX but the most Xe graphics cores, so the integrated Arc GPU can at least compensate a bit (with up to 63-77 GPU TOPS and 99 platform TOPS, depending upon the chip). It has a higher power envelope than the HX (up to 60W), but downshifted general processor performance relative to the HX. In other words, it's likely to be the best balance if you want a laptop that doesn't require you know what you want it for in advance. Except possibly saving money.\n\nCore Ultra 200H series specs\n\nP-Cores/Max boost (GHz) E-cores/low-power E cores (GHz) Power class (base/boost, watts) GPU cores GPU max boost (GHz) Core Ultra 9 258H 6/5.4 8/2 45W-115W 8 Xe (LPG+, 77TOPS) 2.35 Core Ultra 7 265H 6/5.3 8/2 28W-60W 8 Xe (LPG+, 75TOPS) 2.3 Core Ultra 7 255H 6/5.1 8/2 28W-60W 8 Xe (LPG+, 74TOPS) 2.25 Core Ultra 5 235H 4/5 8/2 28W-60W 8 Xe (LPG+, 74TOPS) 2.25 Core Ultra 5 225H 4/4.9 8/2 28W-60W 7 Xe (LPG+, 63TOPS) 2.2\n\nAll this means that manufacturers will be making decisions about configurations they offer that you won't necessarily love; that's nothing new, the additional considerations may fry your brain. It does mine.\n\nThe HX series are expected to ship in March, with the H slated for beforehand.",

All four models, on the other hand, have a commercial version that comes with AMD\u2019s Ryzen Pro management and security features.\n\nWith up to 16 Zen 5 cores, the Ryzen AI Max series increases the maximum core count by four while upping the number of XDNA 3.5 GPU cores by 16 to a maximum of 40 compute units compared to the flagship Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 that debuted last year.\n\nThe lowest-end chip in the Ryzen AI Max series comes with six cores, 12 threads, a maximum clock boost of 4.9GHz and 16 graphics cores.\n\nMeanwhile, the lineup\u2019s XDNA 2 NPU (neural processing unit) is capable of up to 50 trillion operations per second (TOPS) across all models. This is slightly under the 55 TOPS maximum that is possible with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 375.\n\nThe CPU, GPU and NPU are tied together with a new \u201cunified, coherent memory architecture\u201d that allows the PC to allocate up to 96GB of system memory for the GPU, according to Tikoo. This is boosted by a memory bandwidth of 256 GB/s, which the AMD executive called \u201cunprecedented in any x86 mobile device.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt bridges the gap between awesome performance and efficient portability in a whole new way for Windows laptops,\u201d Tikoo said.\n\nHow Ryzen AI Max Compares To Intel, Apple And Nvidia Chips\n\nIn handpicked comparisons to chips from Intel, Apple and Nvidia, the flagship Ryzen AI Max+ 395 was shown by AMD to perform better by varying degrees across benchmarks for 3-D rendering, graphics and running inference for large language models.\n\nCompared to Intel\u2019s recently launched eight-core Core Ultra 9 288V, the 16-core Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is, on average, 2.6 times faster across six 3-D rendering benchmarks, which included Cinebench 2024 nT, Corona and Blender Classroom, according to AMD.\n\nAs for graphics benchmarks such as Night Raid, Time Spy and Fire Strike, the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is 40 percent faster on average, AMD claimed.\n\nThe chip designer also showed that the Ryzen chip is faster than Apple\u2019s 12-core M4 Pro chip\u2014which is available in new MacBook Pros and Mac minis\u2014by 12 percent in Cinebench 2024 nT, 25 percent in Blender Classroom, 39 percent in Corona and 86 percent in Vray.\n\nCompared to Apple\u2019s 14-core M4 Pro, the Ryzen chip is faster by 10 percent in Blender Classroom, 24 percent in Corona and 59 percent in Vray, according to AMD. However, the company conceded that the Ryzen AI Max+ 350 is 3 percent slower than the 14-core M4 Pro in the Cinebench 2024 nT benchmark.\n\nAMD also said the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 could outshine Nvidia\u2019s 24-GB GeForce RTX 4090 desktop graphics card when it comes to AI workloads. When running a 70-billion-parameter Llama 3.1 large language model in LM Studio, the Ryzen chip was 2.2 times faster when measuring tokens per second, according to the chip designer.\n\nThe company noted that the Ryzen system used 128GB of system RAM while the GeForce system had 32 GB of RAM and 24 GB of GPU memory for this comparison.\n\nAMD pointed out that the Ryzen system used significantly less energy than the GeForce system in the test, with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 platform using 55 watts for its thermal design power, 87 percent less than the RTX 4090\u2019s 450 watts.\n\n\u201cThe Ryzen AI Max processor is really a game changer for creators, artists and developers,\u201d said Tikoo.",

The pullback for the stock looks even more significant because most major chip stocks were rallying Monday after Foxconn's fourth-quarter report arrived with bullish indicators for the artificial intelligence (AI) market.\n\nIs Intel getting left in the dust?\n\nAfter the market closed on Friday, The Wall Street Journal published an article by technology writer Christopher Mims titled \"Intel's Problems Are Even Worse Than You've Heard.\" In it, he highlighted the company's declining market share in semiconductors and the challenges to its traditional sources of profitability.\n\nThe columnist painted a bleak picture of Intel's competitive position -- noting that it faced competition from disruptive innovators including Nvidia, ascending rivals such as AMD, and smaller challengers. He also noted that Intel was facing pressures from Microsoft, a partner that has been crucial to its ability to maintain strength in the personal computing and business computing spaces. In particular, Mims sees AMD making huge inroads into Intel's core markets -- and he noted that AMD actually generated more sales in the increasingly crucial data center segment last quarter.\n\nWhat comes next for Intel?\n\nWhile Friday's article focused mostly on Intel's chip design business, the performance of its fabrication segment will also be important when it comes to shaping stock performance. Intel is the world's third-largest chip fabrication company, behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung.\n\nOn the other hand, Intel's fab performance is significantly behind TSMC's, and it has been missing key benchmarks. The company opted to skip using its 20A fabrication node, and early indications suggest that its 18A process node may not be a winner either. If so, that would be a huge setback for the company. Under former CEO Pat Gelsinger, the 18A process node had been positioned as central to the company's strategy in the fabrication space as well as its overall growth strategy.\n\nWith Intel facing pressures in its design and fabrication businesses, its stock has fallen by roughly 57% over the last year. Its current beaten-down valuation could help set the stage for a strong comeback, but if it's going to regain the confidence of investors, Intel will need to present a convincing path forward and deliver some reassuring signs of solid execution.",

            "content": "As a quick reminder of the history of these parts, this is what we thought of them back when they launched: \u201cThis is an excellent first volley from Intel with Alder Lake. It is on the expensive side. Price has crept up, performance, fortunately, has also crept up but so too has power. You get some new and exciting technologies with Alder Lake; DDR5 being one of them. Ultimately, it's about how this competes and this has surprisingly decent value when compared to the 5900X (watch our review) and the 5950X (watch our review), especially in production workloads. There are places where AMD still holds an advantage but they have gotten slimmer.\u201d\n\nThat was for the 12900K. For the 12100F (watch our review), we were also relatively positive: \u201cAt $130, it's actually a pretty exciting CPU for us to review because, for gaming, it did very well. And even with a high-end GPU, it's doing pretty well, so we were impressed with its gaming performance.\u201d\n\nIt feels weird to revisit our old reviews because we were really excited about what Intel was doing at the time. It was fiercely competitive.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget how positive we were on some of Intel\u2019s launches back from the 8000 series into the 12th Gen with Alder Lake when looking at the last few rounds. The 13 and 14 series CPUs were largely refreshes, but Alder Lake brought a new platform forward with new I/O, including options for both DDR4 and DDR5 and PCIe Gen5.\n\nAMD had also forsaken its budget market at this time: Going back through our old reviews, we were reminded of how AMD had gotten so comfortable in its position that it had stopped the 5000 series briefly at the 5600X (watch our review) levels. They introduced the 5600 (watch our review) to help with this, but overall, AMD\u2019s pricing was much higher than it had been in the preceding generations. That left Intel with a huge gap to fill with its 12100F, which later went on to land on our Best CPUs of the Year awards list for at least 2 years for its viability as a true budget gaming part.\n\nSo that\u2019s the history. These CPUs were exciting.\n\nFor this revisit, to make space on the charts so they are somewhat legible, we\u2019re removing the 7900 non-X, 7700 non-X (watch our review), and 7950X (watch our review) ECO Mode results from gaming benchmarks. You can find all these numbers in our 9800X3D review or 7600X3D CPU review if you\u2019d like them. They are directly comparable.\n\nThat\u2019s enough of a history lesson. Let\u2019s get into it -- and we\u2019ll start with a new set of experimental charts.\n\nModern Equivalent Table (Gaming)\n\nEquivalent Gaming Performance in 2024 | Alder Lake Revisit | GamersNexus | EXPERIMENTAL CHARTS\n\n12900K 12700K 12600K 12400 12100F Stellaris i5-14600K\n\nR5 7600 i5-13600K\n\n5600X3D/5700X3D R7 5800X\n\nR5 5600X R5 5600X No Modern Neighbor\n\nClosest: R7 3700X F1 24 i5-13600K\n\nR5 7600X\n\nUltra 5 245K Ultra 5 245K\n\n5600X/5800X R5 5600X 5600X No Modern Neighbor\n\nClosest: R7 3700X Dragon's Dogma 2 R5 5600X3D\n\nUltra 7 265K Ultra 5 245K\n\ni5-13600K\n\nR7 9700X i5-13600K\n\nR7 9700X\n\nR9 7900X R9 7900X\n\nR7 7700X R5 5600X\n\nR7 3700X Rainbow Six Siege Ultra 5 245K\n\n[worse lows]\n\nR7 5800X No Immediate Neighbor\n\nClosest: Ultra 5\n\n245K, 12400 No Suitable Comparison:\n\n- No Modern Neighbor\n\n- No Immediate Neighbor No Modern Neighbor\n\nClosest: R7 3700X No Modern Neighbor\n\nClosest: R7 3700X Total War: Warhammer III Ultra 7 265K\n\nR5 5600X3D\n\nR7 5800X R7 5700X3D\n\nR5 5600X R9 7900X R9 7900 No Modern Neighbor\n\nClosest: R5 3600 Starfield 5800X3D\n\ni5-13600K\n\nR9 7950X\n\nR5 7600X3D Ultra 5 245K\n\nR7 5700X3D\n\nR7 7700X/9700X R9 7900X\n\nR7 5800X R5 9600X\n\nR5 5600X No Modern Neighbor\n\nClosest: R5 3600 Final Fantasy XIV R9 7900\n\ni5-13600K\n\nUltra 7 265K R9 7900\n\ni5-13600K\n\nUltra 7 265K Ultra 5 245K Ultra 5 245K No Modern Neighbor\n\nClosest: R7 3700X Baldur's Gate 3 R9 9700X/9900X\n\nUltra 7 265K\n\nR9 7900/X Ultra 5 245K\n\nR7 7700X R5 7600X\n\ni5-13600K\n\nR5 5600X R5 7600X\n\ni5-13600K\n\nR5 5600X DNF\n\nIssues running benchmark\n\nWe have a table we\u2019re experimenting with for this. This table will list the closest equivalent component for each application tested. Sometimes the ranges don\u2019t line-up well, so we chose the closest within reason, but deferred to older parts where necessary. We defined \u201cmodern\u201d as anything from Ryzen 5000 or newer and anything from Intel 13 and newer, even though 5000 can be pretty old -- it opened up more comparisons.\n\nBroadly speaking, we noticed that the 12900K is similar to a newer i5 in several games. This included Stellaris, F1 24, Starfield, Final Fantasy XIV, and the Ultra 5 in Rainbow Six (but with worse lows). The Ultra 7 265K (read our review) was also close in Final Fantasy and Baldur\u2019s Gate 3. AMD\u2019s CPUs are more varied, and include the 7600 (watch our review), 7600X (watch our review), 5800X, and some X3D parts, generally those are higher performers.\n\nThe 12700K was broadly similar to an Ultra 5 245K from Intel or a 5600X to 5800X from AMD, with some X3D presence. Most X3D parts perform much higher than these Alder Lake CPUs.\n\nThe 12600K was regularly near the 5800X and 13600K CPUs.\n\nThe 12400 regularly neighbored the 5600X and sometimes the 245K or 9600X. The 12100F had few modern neighbors, mostly aligning with a 3700X (watch our review) or 3600 (watch our review) for gaming performance.\n\nModern Equivalent Table (Production)\n\nEquivalent Production Performance in 2024 | Alder Lake Revisit | GamersNexus | EXPERIMENTAL CHARTS\n\n12900K 12700K 12600K 12400 12100F Blender i7-13700K\n\nR9 7900 i5-13600K\n\nR7 7700X R5 9600X\n\nR7 5800X No Modern Neighbor\n\nClosest: R5 3600\n\nClosest: R7 2700 No Modern Neighbor\n\nClosest: R5 2600 Chromium Code Compile i7-13700K\n\nR9 7900/X i5-14600K\n\nUltra 5 245K\n\nR7 9700X R5 9600X R5 5600X3D No Modern Neighbor\n\nClosest: R5 2600 7-Zip Compression i5-14600K\n\nR7 9800X3D Ultra 5 245K\n\nR7 7700X\n\nR7 9700X R5 7600X/9600X\n\nR7 5700X3D R5 5600X No Modern Neighbor\n\nClosest: R5 2600 7-Zip Decompression Ultra 7 265K\n\nR7 9800X3D\n\nR7 7700X R7 5800X\n\nUltra 5 245K R5 7600X3D\n\nR5 5600X No Modern Neighbor\n\nClosest: R5 2600 No Suitable Comparison:\n\n- No Modern Neighbor\n\n- No Immediate Neighbor Adobe Photoshop R5 7600X3D\n\ni5-14600K\n\ni5-13600K\n\nR7 5800X3D i5-13600K\n\nR7 5800X/X3D R7 5800X\n\nR5 5600X3D R5 5600X No Modern Neighbor\n\nClosest: R7 3700X Adobe Premiere R7 9800X3D\n\nUltra 5 245K i5-13600K\n\nR7 9700X\n\nR7 7800X3D R5 9600X\n\nR5 7600X R5 5600X3D\n\nR5 5600X No Modern Neighbor\n\nClosest: R5 2600\n\nHere\u2019s the same concept, but applied to production workloads.\n\nIntel Alder Lake does better here for modern equivalents.

It isn\u2019t distant from the 265K in Decompression, although dips in Premiere closer to a 245K (read our review).\n\nThe 12700K (watch our review) is similar to the 13600K in many of its tests, so after 3 years, it has dropped to subsequent series i5 performance levels. The 245K is regularly right alongside the 12700K. From AMD, the 9700X (read our review) and 7700X are regularly its modern equivalent. The 12600K (watch our review) is most similar to the 9600X or 7600X in many tests, with no nearby modern Intel equivalents. They are all much better than this. We might have to test a 13400 (read our review) or something to see this level.\n\nThe 12400 (watch our review) is regularly near the 5600X. In some tests, it is down at 3600 or 2600 (watch our review) levels. The 12100F has no modern neighbors and, in some instances, no suitable comparisons close by. The R5 2600 (watch our review) is regularly the closest comparison for the 12100F.\n\nIntel 12th Generation Gaming Benchmarks\n\nVisit our Patreon page to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a direct donation or buying something from our GN Store!) Additionally, when you purchase through links to retailers on our site, we may earn a small affiliate commission.\n\nStellaris\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Stellaris, the space game which we use to test for simulation time rather than framerate. This is still a great benchmark because the results don\u2019t care about resolution or graphics: It is a highly CPU-bound game with real-world implications for time.\n\nFirst up, our new entry with the best result is the 9800X3D with liquid nitrogen and at 6.2 GHz. Although you could have a friend or family member pour LN2 while you game, it\u2019s not likely -- but we wanted to put it here to show just how insane the CPU is when pushed to the limits.\n\nSnap back to reality, we have Alder Lake: The 12th Gen CPUs land at 36.7 seconds for the 12900K, 37.7 seconds for the 12700KF, 41.2 seconds for the 12600K, and 43.1 seconds for the 12400. Top-to-bottom, this creates a range of 6.4 seconds, or a reduction in simulation time from the 12400 to the 12900K of 15% -- meaning 15% less time to simulate. If you had bought the 12900K for $630 in 2021, then it\u2019s given you about 3 years of performance and has aged into a modern i5 in this test, which really isn\u2019t that bad. The 14600K is adjacent at 36.6 seconds. An in-socket upgrade to a 14900K (read our review) would get you about a 9.5% reduction in simulation time and is probably not worth it for most people. The 9800X3D (without liquid nitrogen) would yield a 30% reduction in simulation time.\n\nThe 12700K is slightly better than a 5700X3D, with the 12600K around 5800X (watch our review) and 5600X levels. The 12400 is significantly better than the 12100F at 47 seconds and just behind the 5600X.\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2\n\nDragon\u2019s Dogma 2 is up now. In this one, the chart leader is the 9800X3D at 129 FPS AVG, which is an incredible lead over the 7800X3D\u2019s 111 FPS AVG.\n\nThe 12900K falls down to a cluster of Intel parts that cap-out around 100 FPS. The 265K is roughly equivalent to the 12900K in averages and lows. The 245K isn\u2019t far behind.\n\nThe 14900K boosts the ceiling to 110 FPS AVG, alongside the 13900K, 14700K, and 13700K that find a 10% higher ceiling. The 5700X3D has functionally identical performance to the 12900K. Anything on this list is a sidegrade for it other than a 9800X3D.\n\nWe feel the same about the 12700K: It wouldn\u2019t be worth upgrading by this test alone.\n\nThe 12600K and 12400 show more age: Both are still great for framerate and completely playable, but at least a gap to the top is established. Moving to a 9800X3D would boost performance by 46% from the 12600K. An in-socket upgrade might be about 22% by moving to a 13700K.\n\nThe 12100F is at 71 FPS AVG, which is also remarkably good for such a modern game. The lows are hurting a little more and sometimes get spiky, but overall, we\u2019re impressed by how it has held on. Upgrading to a 13700K in-socket would be a huge upgrade from the 12100F. It would be economical, and might be worth considering.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail (1080p)\n\nFinal Fantasy 14: Dawntrail is a 2024 entry for us.\n\nThe Alder Lake series does OK here from an absolute standpoint, but is far down the charts in a relative sense.\n\nThe 12900K and 12700K are between the Ultra 7 265K -- which did horribly in this benchmark -- and the 13600K. The Ultra 200 Series is known to be regressive in this game, with Intel also showing the same behavior. The sad thing is that you\u2019d be going backwards if you didn\u2019t pay attention to benchmarks and bought a 265K. It wouldn\u2019t be a crazy thing to do, either: It\u2019s 3 so-called \u201cgenerations\u201d newer, yet worse than a 12700K and 12900K, at least in this test. The 12600K wouldn\u2019t even see a huge uplift to it either.\n\nThe 13700K and 14700K offer large improvements around 15-18% from Alder Lake, though you\u2019d need a good price to be worth the purchase. The 14900K boosts to 310 FPS AVG, an uplift of 26% over the 12900K.\n\nAMD\u2019s 9800X3D sets the ceiling at 373 FPS AVG, with all the other X3D parts right alongside it.\n\nStarfield\n\nStarfield is up next. The 12900K hits 124 FPS AVG in our test here, which aligns it with the 13600K and 14600K CPUs, slightly bested by the 5800X3D (watch our review). This goes to show how good the 5800X3D was at launch, especially given the price gap when both the 12900K and 5800X3D were still regularly available new.\n\nThe 9800X3D shows room for a 36% improvement in performance from the 12900K. The 285K with ultra-fast, expensive memory in Gear 2 improves by 23% on the 12900K, but the like-for-like comparison has it at 15% ahead.\n\nThe 12700K is similar to a 245K -- you\u2019d be downgrading overall by moving to it, aside from efficiency. The 5700X3D (read our review) is also nearby. Upgrading the 12700K to a 14900K would get you about 13% more performance and probably isn\u2019t worth it overall.\n\nThe 12600K stands to gain more notably if upgraded in-socket to a 13700K, where it\u2019d gain 26%. The 12400 could be worth considering an in-socket jump to a 14600K (watch our review) or 13700K as well, if cheap enough.\n\nThe 12100F is somehow still chugging along, sandwiched between AMD\u2019s 3000-series parts and outperforming the R5 3600 and R7 2700 (watch our review).\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 used to have the X3D series all in the 120s, but the 9800X3D broke that in a massive way and hit 160 FPS AVG in our particular test case. We validated this in our 9800X3D review and explained why it\u2019s happening.\n\nX3D dominates the entire top quarter of this chart, followed next by the memory-boosted 285K. The prior generation 14900K, 13900K, and 13700K are all within error of each other. Don\u2019t be confused by their ordering: Their performance is identical and within run-to-run variance, which is due to encountering a memory limitation. We can see this from the 285K (read our review) stock results versus the DDR5-8600 results.\n\nThe 12900K ran at 96 FPS AVG, or equal to the 265K. The 265K would be an expensive downgrade when looking at the total picture. The 12900K is still doing well enough here that it probably doesn\u2019t make sense to replace except maybe with a 9800X3D.\n\nThe 12700K is about tied with a 245K. Like the 12900K, there aren\u2019t many worthy upgrades here. A 13700K, 13900K (watch our review), or 14900K would give about a 15% uplift in our testing.\n\nThe 12600K and 12400 are at about 13600K levels of performance. An in-socket upgrade to a 13700K in this chart would yield about 28% improvement from these CPUs. The 12100F had trouble running this test. We might be able to force it to work, but natively, the low performance was bad enough that we consider it disqualifying in our test.\n\nF1 24 - 1080p\n\nF1 24 is up next.\n\nThe game scales from 163 FPS AVG up to 464 FPS AVG in our testing. The 12900K starts Alder Lake off down in the range of the i5 CPUs, including the 13600K and 14600K. Inspecting the data, we found that the 12900K had a more variable average FPS than some other CPUs, which we think is due to its core arrangement and Windows 2H24: The range was 310.5 FPS to 316 FPS AVG run-to-run, and upon inspection, it is due to the frametime pacing where we sometimes get a higher throughput with worse pacing and sometimes the opposite.\n\nOverall, it ends up around 13600K levels. We saw this last round as well, just with an older Windows version. The 14900K has a 23% advantage on the 12900K. The 9800X3D runs 49% ahead of the 12900K.\n\nThe 12700KF is between the 5800X and 5600X, with the 245K just ahead. Intel\u2019s 12600K lands at 270 FPS AVG, meaning a 13700K upgrade would boost the average by about 34%.\n\nThe 12100F still does great here, all things considered, and is just ahead of the 3700X.\n\nProduction Benchmarks\n\nOn to production benchmarks. For these tests, we\u2019re looking at applications like Blender, Chromium code compile, and more. Users of the i7 and i9 CPUs are more likely to care about the performance here. It\u2019s also one of Intel\u2019s strong points of the past generations.\n\nBlender\n\nBlender 3D rendering is up first for production.\n\nThe 12900K did well here. It\u2019s at 11.7 minutes required to complete a single-frame render of the GN intro animation, which has it about tied with the 12C/24T AMD R9 7900 non-X CPU. The 13700K does well with its higher frequency and equal core count to the 12900K. The 14900K has large gains here from moving to a 32-thread configuration, reducing the time required by 27% to 8.5 minutes. That\u2019s about the same we see from the newer 265K, with the 285K doing well in one of its few strong tests and reducing time to 7.1 minutes. That has it at about the 9950X levels of performance.\n\nIf you were upgrading for gaming, the 9800X3D is the only option that might universally make sense against the 12900K. But for production, unfortunately, the options wouldn\u2019t necessarily move the needle on gaming performance in a meaningful way despite offering large gains in workstation applications. You\u2019d have to choose.\n\nThe 12700KF has the same core count as the 13600K, so the two perform about the same. An upgrade to the 14900K in-socket would be a huge 39% reduction in render time required.\n\nThe 12600K is at about levels of the 9600X. The 7800X3D (watch our review) outperforms it, but is better in gaming than production as compared to the non-3D parts like the 7700X. The 9800X3D would at least improve on the 12600K somewhat while giving a big boost to gaming.\n\nAs for the 12400 and 12100F, they\u2019re near the bottom. The 12100F struggles with core count, so the 2600 is a little faster. The 12400 is roughly tied with the 3600.\n\nChromium\n\nIn Chromium code compile, the 12900K required 119 minutes to complete the compile. This has it closer to the R9 7900 non-X (watch our review) than anything else. The 13700K improves with its higher frequency and equal core count, with the 14900K giving a compile time reduction of 26% less time. The 285K is also a big step up, though not significantly different from the 14900K.\n\nIntel\u2019s 12600K might see enough benefit from an in-socket upgrade to a 14900K or 14700K (read our review) that it\u2019d be worth considering, especially for the gaming uplift, but only if you\u2019re trying to save on cost by reusing a board and DDR5 RAM.\n\nThe 12100F required 382 minutes, which is still about an hour more time than the R7 2700 and about tied with the R5 2600.\n\n7-Zip Compression\n\n7-Zip compression testing makes the 12900K feel a little older, outperforming the 14600K by just 4.3% (and similar for the 9800X3D). In the very least, upgrading to a 9800X3D for gaming would at least net equal performance in this type of task.\n\nThe 14900K offers a 38% increase in MIPS over the 12900K, maybe making it worth considering.\n\nA new build with a 9950X yields about a 46% uplift in this benchmark.\n\nThe 12700K is down near the 7700X (watch our review) and 9700X, with the 14700K 48% higher in MIPS.\n\nIf you have a 12600K and wanted to stay on Alder Lake, moving to the 12900K improves performance by 48% here, which is pretty massive.\n\nThe 12400 is more similar to a 5600X or 3600, so anything would be an upgrade. The 12100F is at the bottom, falling behind the R5 2600 in a predictable way with its thread deficiency in this test.\n\n7-Zip Decompression\n\n7-Zip decompression shows a lot of scaling with cores, as indicated by the 9950X (read our review) and 7950X. The 12900K still does OK here and bests the 9800X3D on a technicality. The 265K offers an uplift that wouldn\u2019t be worth buying into, with the 285K pushing 30% higher in MIPS to 193K. The 7900X (watch our review) and 13900K offer more meaningful uplifts though, with the 13900K and 14900K benefiting from higher thread count and opening opportunities for upgrades.\n\nThe 12700KF is at 245K levels of performance and about tied with a 5800X. The 12600K would see multiples of uplift with some of the newer options at the top of this chart, again including the 14900K and 13900K. The 12100F isn\u2019t comparable to anything here, with the 12400 similar to an R5 2600.\n\nAdobe Premiere\n\nAdobe testing is next with the Puget Suite.\n\nBack with the Alder Lake launch, we stuck with Intel for our Premiere editing systems since it was the best opportunity at that time.\n\nToday, the part still does pretty well in Premiere. Actually, we still use its direct descendants in our main editing machines, including 13700Ks and various i9s. The 12900K scored 9948 points in aggregate, which has it between the 9800X3D and 7900X. The 14900K wouldn\u2019t boost it much, only 11% here. The 285K scores a rare victory in this one, but again wouldn\u2019t be a huge move if you\u2019re already on a 12900K. It might make more sense for a new build.\n\nThe 12700KF could be kept relevant a little longer with a bump to a 14700K and still be a top scorer on the chart with modern memory. The same goes for the 12600K and 12400.\n\nThe 12100F at least outdoes the 2600, but that\u2019s it.\n\nAdobe Photoshop\n\nAdobe Photoshop is last.\n\nThis one is a bloodbath compared to many years ago, with Adobe updates and AMD architecture changes benefiting AMD.\n\nThe 12900K is in the lower half of the chart and surrounded by i5 CPUs, with the 12600K near AMD\u2019s 5800X. The 12100F at least does comparatively better here and outranks the R5 3600.\n\nOverall, almost anything is an upgrade over Alder Lake in this test.\n\nConclusion\n\nGrab a GN15 All-Over Print Component Mouse Mat for a high-quality mousing surface that'll fit your keyboard & mouse. These mouse mats use a high-quality yellow rubber underside, a blue stitched border for fray resistance, and are covered in PC parts. This is the best way to support our work and keeps us ad-free to support consumer-first reviews!\n\nWrapping things up, the 12th Gen CPUs are still pretty good.\n\nPeople commonly ask us when they should buy or wait. If you\u2019re on a 12th Gen CPU, we\u2019ll break it down like this: Ask yourself if you\u2019re happy with your PC right now. If you\u2019re not actively annoyed by your computer\u2019s performance, then you can just keep using it. If, however, the performance is bad or you just want to build a PC because it\u2019s fun, then there are options here.\n\nOne of the options is for an in-socket upgrade, to which there are caveats, which we\u2019ll discuss below. Another option is to build a new system.\n\nFor the in-socket option, the 13th and 14th series would be potential drop-in upgrades. The lower down the stack 12th Gen CPU you have, like the 12400F (read our review) or 12600K, the more meaningful it would be to do this.\n\nFor this to work, you need to make sure your motherboard with a 12th Gen CPU has the newer CPUs on its compatibility list. You should be able to find this on the manufacturer\u2019s website. You would also need to update the BIOS. If you\u2019re upgrading from something like a 12100F to a 13900K, you\u2019d want to make sure that your board has a good enough VRM to handle the additional heat and power. Likewise, it\u2019s ideally an unlocked board for more feature support.\n\nWe tested on DDR5 here with like-for-like memory between the platforms. You could have used DDR4 with 12th Gen also. DDR4 could be a limiting factor, so if you have to upgrade your RAM and motherboard, you may as well go with a fully new build from AMD instead (if building a gaming PC), like a 9800X3D or similar.\n\nAnd finally, used CPUs might be a bit of a landmine situation, unfortunately. Intel\u2019s 13th and 14th Gen woes are detailed in other stories we\u2019ve published, but one potential problem is that used CPUs could have instability issues. You\u2019ll want to be careful when buying used. This is unfortunate, because CPUs have historically been pretty bullet-proof -- especially Intel\u2019s -- and have been a great used option to save a quick $100 on an in-socket upgrade.\n\nThe price of new 13th and 14th series have dropped in price, which makes something like a 13700K not a bad option, especially if you\u2019re on a lower tier 12th series part.\n\nOverall, objectively speaking, Intel\u2019s 12th CPUs (for the most part) are still great gaming parts. They\u2019re not at the top of the charts anymore, but that\u2019s OK.",

            "content": "On Monday, Intel published a list of its mainstream Core Ultra 200S processors for desktop PCs. The family of non-K Core Ultra 200S \"Arrow Lake-S\" CPUs with 65W and 35W processor base power includes 11 models, which will join six Core Ultra 200K processors that have already been available for a quarter.\n\nThe range of Intel's Core Ultra 200S processors for mainstream and low-power PCs includes CPUs with 10 (6P+4E) 14 (6P + 8E), 20 (8P + 12E), and 24 (8P + 16E) cores, depending on positioning. All the CPUs support up to 192 GB of DDR5-6400 memory and feature 24 PCIe lanes, including 16 PCIe 5.0 lanes for graphics cards, four PCI 5.0 lanes for an SSD, and four more PCIe 4.0 lanes for another drive. Interestingly, Intel does not mention support for CUDIMMs.\n\nNine out of 11 Core Ultra 200S processors for mainstream and low-power desktops feature integrated graphics with four (512 stream processors), three (384 SPs), or two (256 SPs) Xe cores based on the Xe2 LPG microarchitecture. Traditionally, F-series processors do not feature an iGPU, so these CPUs require a discrete graphics card.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Core Ultra 9 285 Core Ultra 9 285T Core Ultra 7 265 Core Ultra 7 265F Core Ultra 7 265T Core Ultra 5 245 Core Ultra 5 245T Core Ultra 5 235 Core Ultra 5 235T Core Ultra 5 225 Core Ultra 5 225F Total Cores 24 24 20 20 20 14 14 14 14 10 10 Performance Cores 8 8 8 8 8 6 6 6 6 6 6 Efficient Ccores 16 16 12 12 12 8 8 8 8 4 4 Total Threads 24 24 20 20 20 14 14 14 14 10 10 Max Turbo Frequency 5.6 GHz 5.4 GHz 5.3 GHz 5.3 GHz 5.3 GHz 5.1 GHz 5.1 GHz 5 GHz 5 GHz 4.9 GHz 4.9 GHz Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 Frequency 5.5 GHz 5.4 GHz 5.3 GHz 5.3 GHz 5.3 GHz Row 6 - Cell 6 Row 6 - Cell 7 Row 6 - Cell 8 Row 6 - Cell 9 Row 6 - Cell 10 Performance-core Max Turbo Frequency 5.4 GHz 5.3 GHz 5.2 GHz 5.2 GHz 5.2 GHz 5.1 GHz 5.1 GHz 5 GHz 5 GHz 4.9 GHz 4.9 GHz Efficient-core Max Turbo Frequency 4.6 GHz 4.6 GHz 4.6 GHz 4.6 GHz 4.6 GHz 4.5 GHz 4.5 GHz 4.4 GHz 4.4 GHz 4.4 GHz 4.4 GHz Performance-core Base Frequency 2.5 GHz 1.4 GHz 2.4 GHz 2.4 GHz 1.5 GHz 3.5 GHz 2.2 GHz 3.4 GHz 2.2 GHz 3.3 GHz 3.3 GHz Efficient-core Base Frequency 1.9 GHz 1.2 GHz 1.8 GHz 1.8 GHz 1.2 GHz 3 GHz 1.7 GHz 2.9 GHz 1.6 GHz 2.7 GHz 2.7 GHz Peak TOPS 36 35 33 25 33 29 29 27 27 23 19 Cache 36 MB Smart Cache 36 MB Smart Cache 30 MB Smart Cache 30 MB Smart Cache 30 MB Smart Cache 24 MB Smart Cache 24 MB Smart Cache 24 MB Smart Cache 24 MB Smart Cache 20 MB Smart Cache 20 MB Smart Cache Total L2 Cache 40 MB 40 MB 36 MB 36 MB 36 MB 26 MB 26 MB 26 MB 26 MB 22 MB 22 MB Base Power 65 W 35 W 65 W 65 W 35 W 65 W 35 W 65 W 35 W 65 W 65 W Maximum Turbo Power 182 W 112 W 182 W 182 W 112 W 121 W 114 W 121 W 114 W 121 W 121 W Deep Learning Boost (DL Boost) on CPU Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Max Memory 192 GB 192 GB 192 GB 192 GB 192 GB 192 GB 192 GB 192 GB 192 GB 192 GB 192 GB Memory Types Up to DDR5 6400 MT/s Up to DDR5 6400 MT/s Up to DDR5 6400 MT/s Up to DDR5 6400 MT/s Up to DDR5 6400 MT/s Up to DDR5 6400 MT/s Up to DDR5 6400 MT/s Up to DDR5 6400 MT/s Up to DDR5 6400 MT/s Up to DDR5 6400 MT/s Up to DDR5 6400 MT/s GPU Base Frequency 300 MHz 300 MHz 300 MHz - 300 MHz 300 MHz 300 MHz 300 MHz 300 MHz 300 MHz - GPU Max Dynamic Frequency 2 GHz 2 GHz 1.95 GHz - 1.95 GHz 1.9 GHz 1.9 GHz 2 GHz 2 GHz 1.8 GHz - GPU Peak TOPS (Int8) 8 8 8 - 8 8 8 6 6 4 - Xe-cores 4 4 4 - 4 4 4 3 3 2 - PCI Express Configurations \u2021 Up to 1x16+2x4 | 2x8+2x4 | 1x8+4x4 Up to 1x16+2x4 | 2x8+2x4 | 1x8+4x4 Up to 1x16+2x4 | 2x8+2x4 | 1x8+4x4 Up to 1x16+2x4 | 2x8+2x4 | 1x8+4x4 Up to 1x16+2x4 | 2x8+2x4 | 1x8+4x4 Up to 1x16+2x4 | 2x8+2x4 | 1x8+4x4 Up to 1x16+2x4 | 2x8+2x4 | 1x8+4x4 Up to 1x16+2x4 | 2x8+2x4 | 1x8+4x4 Up to 1x16+2x4 | 2x8+2x4 | 1x8+4x4 Up to 1x16+2x4 | 2x8+2x4 | 1x8+4x4 Up to 1x16+2x4 | 2x8+2x4 | 1x8+4x4 Max # of PCI Express Lanes 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24\n\nThe AI performance of Intel's Arrow Lake-S processors with locked multipliers varies from model to model and spans from 19 to 36 TOPS.

But team blue is touting maximized control with \u201cmore overclocking features and data-lanes than ever.\u201d\n\nAnd when you take a look at the number of GPU cores and NPU TOPS, the decision Intel made here is to work in tandem with a dGPU for maximum performance (Intel themselves confirmed you can see gaming systems coming in the next couple months).\n\nIntel Core Ultra 200U looks a bit sus to me\n\nYou may have noticed that Intel also announced another CPU line, the budget end power efficient Intel Core Ultra 200U.

            "content": "The Intel 8080 was the very first multi-purpose microprocessor and as such played a pivotal role in the evolution of personal computing. 2024 was the 50th anniversary of the chip that influenced the development of the x86 architecture.\n\nThe story of how Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore co-founded Intel in 1968 is told in detail in The Road to Silicon Valley, Intel - The Microprocessor Revolution and other articles in IProgrammer's History section. By 1974, Intel was firmly established as the most important manufacturer of microprocessors, having launched the groundbreaking 4004 three years earlier, see Birth of the Intel 4004 - the First Microprocessor.\n\nThe 4-bit 4004 and its 8-bit counterpart the 8008, both designed by Federico Faggin, were intended for specific hardware -Busicom\u2019s 141-PF printing calculator for the former and Computer Terminal Corporation\u2019s Datapoint 2200 programmable terminal for the latter. However growing interest in microcomputers and the potential for new applications led to customer demand for a more powerful and versatile microprocessor.\n\nAlthough Faggin came up with the concept of the 8080 in 1971 and proposed the chip to Intel's management in the spring of 1972, Intel didn't immediately approve the project as it wanted to focus on shipping to 4004 and 8008. Once given approval, Faggin hired Masatoshi Shima, who had helped design the logic of the 4004 with him, from Japan in November 1972. Arriving in Silicon Valley from Japan, Shima did the detailed design under Faggin's direction, using the design methodology for random logic with silicon gate that Faggin had created for the 4000 family and the 8008.\n\nMuch of the development effort was spent trying to integrate the functionalities of the 8008's supplemental chips into a single package in order for it to function as a general-purpose microprocessor. It was decided early in development that the 8080 was not to be binary-compatible with the 8008, instead opting for source compatibility once run through a transpiler, to allow new software to not be subject to the same restrictions as the 8008. For the same reason, as well as to expand the capabilities of stack-based routines and interrupts, the stack was moved to external memory. Another design decision was that the 8080's registers would be specialized, with register pairs having a different set of uses. This also allowed the engineers to more effectively use transistors for other purposes.\n\nThe Intel 8080 was an eight-bit processor with a 16-bit address bus, enabling it to access up to 64 KB of memory. It operated at a 2-MHz clock speed, though faster variants like the 3.125-MHz 8080A-1 were later released. Its design included seven general-purpose eight-bit registers, a 16-bit stack pointer, and a 16-bit program counter. Its instruction set featured over 70 operations for data transfer, arithmetic, logic, and control flow.\n\nThis Intel infographic shows how it stacks up against Intel's latest generation of microprocessor:\n\nThe 8080's capabilities made it the ideal choice for early personal computers. It was used for the iconic Altair 8800, sparking the microcomputer revolution and paving the way for the personal computers we know today. Its design influenced the development of the x86 and X64 architecture.\n\nOf course there are those who would wish that a different processor, the 6800, would have been the foundation on which the future was built - but it was not to be.\n\nHarry Fairhead is I Programmer's hardware guy. He is the author of The 386/486 PC: Power User's Guide, published by I/O Press.

While for Intel, it's more about the budget and non-overclockable Arrow Lake chips, AMD will be focusing on higher-end Ryzen 9000X3D CPUs. Nonetheless, both have budget 800-series motherboard lineups missing at the moment, which will be revealed in their respective turns.\n\nFor Intel Arrow Lake desktop processors, there are two 800 chipsets: B860 and H810, and for AMD, there are B850 and B840. The leaker @momomo_us has posted pics of four models with three of these chipsets, namely: Intel B860, AMD B850, and AMD B840. All of them are from MSI with models as follows:\n\nMAG B860 Tomahawk WiFi\n\nPRO B850-P WiFi\n\nB850 Gaming Plus WiFi\n\nPRO B840-P WiFi\n\nThe first one, i.e., MAG B860 Tomahawk WiFi is for Intel processors, featuring the classic black PCB design with greenish accents. The board will feature 4x DIMMs, 2x PCI-E x16 slots, 1x PCI-E x1 slot, at least 3x M.2 connectors, 4x SATA ports, and built-in WiFi 7. It will feature Thunderbolt 4 ports on the I/O as well, as seen on the box. The motherboard has 2x 8-pin EPS connectors above the DIMM slots, which we saw previously as well, and there is an additional 8-pin PCI-E connector at the bottom, which will provide up to 150W of power to the GPU alongside 75W from the PCI-E x16 slot.\n\nThe next three are all AM5 motherboards. The first one is the MSI PRO B850-P WiFi, featuring a black PCB with white/silverish heatsinks. The board features 4x PCI-E x16 slots, which is rare on budget motherboards these days, and also has that 8-pin connector at the bottom. There are 3x m.2 slots and 4x SATA ports for storage drives.\n\nThe third one is the MSI B840 Gaming Plus WiFi, offering a unique appearance with white heatsinks and grey-blue accents. There are even more PCI-E x16 slots on this one than you will see on the PRO B850-P WiFi. A whopping 5x PCI-E x16 slots are available on this board, which is too many, but apparently, you won't be able to fully populate all of them at the same time due to PCI-E lane limitations. It misses the bottom 8-pin PCI-E connector and appears to be an entry-level board.\n\nThe last one is the MSI PRO B840-P WiFi, which also gets 5x PCI-E x16 slots, 4x DIMMs, 2x M.2 connectors, 4x SATA ports, and some basic connectivity. All of these are expected to be unveiled at CES, where their detailed specs, features, pricing, and availability will be disclosed.",

            "content": "Intel has discontinued its RS1 Laminar stock cooler, which was previously the lowest-end model among the company\u2019s three stock coolers.\n\nIntroduced in 2021 alongside 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs, the RS1 uses an all-aluminum design with a plastic shroud that\u2019s just 47mm tall and weighs around 260 grams. It\u2019s essentially an upgraded version of Intel\u2019s old stock cooler, with a more optimally designed heatsink and a larger, five-blade fan, and is rated to cool 65 watt chips.\n\nIntel also has two other stock coolers, the RH1 and the RM1. The RM1 is almost identical to the RS1, except it has a copper slug at the bottom for better heat transfer, as well as an LED light strip that circles the fan. Like the now-discontinued RS1, the RM1 is also rated for 65 watts. The RH1 meanwhile is a wholly different design that\u2019s taller, uses more copper, and a more premium metal shroud.\n\nThe RS1 only ever shipped with two dual-core CPUs: the Pentium Gold G7400 and the Celeron G6900. Although Intel\u2019s weakest stock cooler isn\u2019t particularly robust, it doesn\u2019t struggle to cool either the G7400 or the G6900 since both have a TDP of just 46 watts.\n\nThat\u2019s probably one of the main reasons why it got discontinued. It\u2019s hard to justify making a stock cooler just for two CPUs, let alone just for dual-core Pentiums and Celerons, which aren\u2019t exactly popular in recent times.\n\nIntel says that the RS1 won\u2019t have a direct successor, but will just be replaced by the RM1. Simplifying its stock cooler offerings could have also been another motivation for Intel to ditch its all-aluminum cooler since the RS1 and RM1 are already nearly identical. The RM1 is already used for the vast majority of locked Intel CPUs, everything from the Core i3s and the Core i7s in the 12th, 13th, and 14th generations.\n\nThe RM1 is also used for the Intel Processor 300, a rebranded Pentium G7400. The Processor 300 came out just around a year ago, and the fact that it used the RM1 may have been a sign that the RS1 wasn\u2019t long for this world.",

            "content": "This Sentell Intel rep on Georgia football recruiting has the latest from Georgia receivers coach James Coley about what the 2025 group of signees will add to the Bulldogs\u2019 position.\n\nReceivers.\n\nThat position group is on the very short list of things Georgia football needs to do to return to the standard of winning national championships.\n\nThat was readily apparent watching the Dawgs drop passes at an alarming rate in 2024. Forget making a man defender miss or cooking DBs with extra crispy routes. Fans were trained for the bare minimum of just catching the ball.\n\nThe Sugar Bowl broadcast cited 36 dropped passes this season.\n\nOof.\n\nThe Bulldogs might have added at least one more drop to that tally by the end of the game. How in the name of Larry Munson does a national recruiting juggernaut like Georgia allow it to get to that point?\n\nThat\u2019s a story. Just not as good of a story as what Georgia is doing to fix the matter. There\u2019s news today that short-term help is on the way from the transfer portal.\n\nGeorgia added former 5-star receiver Zachariah Branch to its roster on Sunday afternoon. The former USC Trojan is electric in the open field. DawgNation should expect him to provide a big-play threat similar to what former speedster Mecole Hardman Jr. added to the offense a few years back.\n\nThe Dawgs are also in hot pursuit of Texas A&M transfer portal WR entry Noah Thomas. Thomas was in Athens this weekend. There\u2019s a link between Thomas and receivers coach James Coley. Coley was on the staff at A&M for four seasons from 2020-2023.\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 200-pounder has great speed. He doesn\u2019t have a perfect reputation when it comes to catching the ball, but he did snare eight touchdowns for a team that didn\u2019t have great QB play this past season.\n\nThomas caught 39 passes, but he was also the only A&M receiver with more than two touchdowns catches this fall. Georgia had five players with at least four touchdown catches.\n\nDominic Lovett had the team high in touchdown catches (six) this past season. Branch and the potential addition of Thomas at \u201cX\u201d is good, but that\u2019s not enough.\n\nGeorgia has seen a major dip in recruiting elite receivers out of high school. The program hasn\u2019t gotten much production from the nine receivers it signed across their last three recruiting classes.\n\n2024: Georgia\u2019s two WR signees (Nitro Tuggle and Sacovie White) played in 11 combined games this year. Tuggle appeared in eight. They combined for seven catches for 72 yards and no scores. The two wideouts have a lot of potential, but weren\u2019t ready to show it yet this season. (The highest-rated signee in this class was Tuggle at No. 102 overall.)\n\n2023: Georgia signed three WRs. Zeed Haynes (Syracuse) and Tyler Williams (Minnesota) transferred after their freshman seasons. That duo caught nine combined passes for their new teams in 2024. The third wideout in the class, Anthony Evans III, announced earlier today he\u2019ll be hitting the portal. Evans had nine catches for 88 yards in 2024. (The highest-rated signee in this class was Williams at No. 95 overall.)\n\n2022: Georgia signed four receivers. While former 3-star Cole Speer is a special teams ace, he only caught three passes for 37 yards this season. Former 4-star CJ Smith transferred to Purdue after last season. He caught six passes in 2024. Former 4-star De\u2019Nylon Morrisette also transferred to Purdue and caught 11 passes this fall. Georgia regular Dillon Bell caught 43 passes for 466 yards and four scores this year. (The highest-rated signee in this class was Smith at No. 231 overall.)\n\nAdd it all up. The season stats for the nine high school receivers Georgia signed across its last three years of recruiting tallied up to 88 combined catches in 2024.\n\nOof.\n\nThere are now only four left on the active roster in Athens. Bell was the only one who got significant run for the Dawgs in 2024 among that nine. His 43 receptions make up half of that 88-catch total.\n\nThat\u2019s why the big plays were consistently missing at the receiver spot. Georgia\u2019s last four waves of recruiting was non-existent save for Bell. Most were somewhere else. That\u2019s why key transfer portal entries like London Humphreys, Dominic Lovett, RaRa Thomas and Colbie Young were expected to form the core for Carson Beck this season.\n\nThat\u2019s the not-so-good news.\n\nThe better news is that Coley signed a class of wideouts this year that was the highest-rated since the 2020 cycle. This group features the two highest-rated wide receivers the Bulldogs have signed since 2020.\n\nThat\u2019s a Woof, not an Oof.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown:\n\n5-star Talyn Taylor (Nation\u2019s No. 27 overall prospect) : Taylor is the highest-rated signee at WR since George Pickens in 2019. If that\u2019s not enough, he caught 84 passes for 1,617 yards and 24 touchdowns at Geneva High in Illinois this season.\n\n: 4-star CJ Wiley (Nation\u2019s No. 79 overall): The 6-foot-4 Wiley is the second-highest-rated signee at WR since the 2020 cycle with Marcus Rosemy-Jacksaint, Arian Smith and Jermaine Burton. He caught 130 passes for 2,595 yards and 29 touchdowns for a back-to-back state champion Milton High team in 2023 and 2024.\n\n4-star Thomas Blackshear (Nation\u2019s No. 268 overall): Blackshear, a contested catch and yards after catch demon from Savannah, would have been as talented as anyone UGA signed in the 2022 cycle that included Bell, Morrisette, Smith and Speer. He\u2019s just the third highest-rated prospect in this class. He\u2019s the only one in this group who will not enroll early. Blackshear had 47 catches for 1,042 yards and 17 TDs. He had an average of 22 yards per catch as a senior.\n\n4-star Tyler J Williams (Nation\u2019s No. 367 overall) : Finished his first year at Armwood with 37 catches for 924 yards and 10 scores. That\u2019s 24.9 yards per catch in Florida Class 6A ball. Williams gives the Dawgs another deadly vertical threat. He made big catches despite constant double teams from opponents.\n\n: 3-star Landon Roldan (Nation\u2019s No. 480 overall): The lowest-rated signee might be the most intriguing. Georgia legend David Pollack says Roldan\u2019s super hero trait is ball skills. He believes that he\u2019s better than former standout Ladd McConkey in several areas. Roldan combines that with sub 4.3-speed in the 40. He had 76 catches for 1,369 yards and 20 touchdowns. The longtime UGA fan went over the 2,500-yard mark in receiving with 34 touchdown catches for his career. He was also a vital cog in a team that won back-to-back state baseball championships in 2022 and 2023.\n\nWhat did Coley feel this group will add to the room? That was a fun conversation at Sugar Bowl Media Day in New Orleans. He enjoyed breaking down this group.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, you want to sign the best players you can sign,\u201d Coley said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we all say, but you want to fill a need.\u201d\n\nGeorgia clearly had needs in this class.\n\n\u201cYou want to get length,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to get speed and we want to get toughness and then get guys who can get open and catch the ball. So that was the main focus. Who loves football and who has talent and can then play and then play at a high level that Coach Smart wants that can win championships.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we went after. Those type of guys. I knew that we had a number that we had to get. So I figured, heck, let\u2019s go get the best five with that number.\u201d\n\nWhat were the biggest boxes this class checked?\n\n\u201cWe brought in the ability to get open because of the confirmed speed by these guys,\u201d Coley said. \u201cThen I think at wideout you have got to be able to make contested catches in this league in the SEC and then when you play in the playoffs the coverage is going to be even better because you are going to be going against NFL players.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got to have an NFL player in your room. So I look at it like, is this guy going to play in the National Football League? Do I feel he has the talent to do that because he can get open, catch the football and have a high football IQ?\u201d\n\nColey has great people skills. That\u2019s what makes him an ace recruiter. Smart is like that, too.\n\nIt was different for him in the class when he got a commitment from the Taylors and the Wileys in this class. That wasn\u2019t so much a fist-pump moment. Even while trying to dispel the negative recruiting about Georgia throwing the ball. Or developing NFL receivers.\n\nThen there is the facts that receivers are considered a \u201cdiva\u201d position and the 5-star receivers seek more NIL dollars than every before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not about getting them,\u201d Coley said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about \u2018Man, this room just got better\u2019 here. Do you know what I mean about that? You\u2019re fired up about being able to coach someone now. If you\u2019re doing it right, that you already know is going to be great to be in a foxhole with.\u201d\n\nColey has long had the \u201cChange the Game\u201d catchphrase around the program. He might have earned himself a new one over the last cycle.\n\nHis efforts helped \u201cChange the Room\u201d with the 2025 class plus Branch. The potential addition of Thomas would really start to stack the room with more of those NFL guys.\n\nHave you subscribed to the DawgNation YouTube channel yet?

The image suggests preliminary enablement for Panther Lake, Wildcat Lake, Nova Lake, and Razer Lake CPUs is underway. This leak does not necessarily indicate that all these processors will be released. However, the consistency of family codenames with previous leaks suggests they could see the light of day.\n\nThe shared snippet details code allows the Linux kernel to recognize and work with these new CPUs. PCI IDs or Peripheral Component Interconnect IDs are unique codes used to identify devices connected to a system. The listed processors include several shorthands: LNL: Lunar Lake, PTL: Panther Lake, NVL: Nova Lake, WCL: Wildcat Lake, and RZL: Razer Lake. Suffixes appended after the dash depict the market segment or specific features: P: Performance (Mobile), H: Highest performance (Mobile), S: Desktop, M: Thin and lightweight (Mobile).\n\nWe have Panther Lake in P and H variants, with varying TDPs, samples of which are reportedly already powered on at eight customers. Previous leaks suggest a low-power U-version as well. Similarly, PTL-H is rumored to offer up to 16 cores and a 12 Xe3-core-based iGPU (Integrated GPU). Next up is Nova Lake, said to be Intel's next major desktop release and expected to launch by 2026-27. Moving on, the suffix-less Wildcat Lake is rumored to succeed current-gen Alder Lake-N and Twin Lake CPUs for mini-PCs and low-power systems.\n\n(Image credit: Kernel Patches via Tomasz Gawro\u0144ski\n\nLast on the list is the rumored Razer Lake, following Nova Lake in Intel's product stack. RZL-M, likely the successor to Lunar Lake, has been identified, but interestingly, there's no mention of RZL-S for desktop. Since Intel rejected an on-package memory approach for future CPUs, Razer Lake-M might adopt a different strategy. Of course, this list is incomplete, and expect a barrage of changes as final specifications are hammered out.\n\nThe CPUs are years away, except for Panther Lake and Wildcat Lake. Panther Lake, fabricated on the bleeding-edge Intel 18A node, will launch this year and may be announced at Computex one year after Lunar Lake.",

            "content": "The Intel Arc B580 arrived with a far bigger splash than many could have predicted when it launched just ahead of the holiday season last year. The budget gaming GPU delivered performance that exceeded expectations and arrived at a truly compelling price. However, further testing has revealed that the card\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t hold up when run on some older systems.\n\nWith the new Intel GPU previously making a strong pitch for a place on the best graphics card guides of the world, this new revelation could seriously hurt Intel\u2018s push to consolidate its position.\n\nThe performance issues were discovered by tech testers Hardware Canucks, who posted a video to their YouTube channel discussing their test results. In it, they point out how initial testing with a modern, fast, CPU such as the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D results in consistently excellent performance for the price of the card. However, when testing with an older Intel Core i5 9600K CPU on a Z390 motherboard \u2013 a six year old system \u2013 the performance of the card becomes far more variable.\n\nWhile several games showed either no meaningful performance drop or had a 10-20% performance drop in line with the other GPUs on test \u2013 the older CPU was just a consistent limiting factor \u2013 in some games, the Intel Arc B580 frame rate dropped off a cliff. For instance, in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, the card dropped from a 74.3fps average to 52.5fps, while most other cards only dropped by around 10%.\n\nAn even worse example is Spider-Man Remastered where the Arc B580 dropped from an average of 154.7fps to just 74.9fps average. That means it went from a chart-topping result when pitted against the RTX 4060, RX 7600, RX 6700XT, and GTX 1660 Super to being the slowest on test. Yes, that\u2019s slower than the six-year-old, mid-range, GTX 1660 Super.\n\nOther games affected include Starfield and Hogwarts: Legacy, though the list of unaffected titles does include plenty of modern ones such as Cyberpunk 2077, Black Myth Wukong, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. It\u2019s just that the list of affected titles is significant too.\n\nLooking at CPU utilization during their tests, Hardware Canucks conclude that the issue wasn\u2019t the CPU being taxed more when using the Intel Arc B580 card and thus becoming a bottleneck. Instead, the CPU utilization was lower, showing that it is the card itself that\u2019s holding back performance. This, they conclude, hints at the issue being the Intel graphics drivers.\n\nWhen Intel launched its first Arc GPU, the Intel Arc A770, it had issues with performance in older games because of a lack of driver optimization and it seems these new cards have a similar issue but with older CPUs now.\n\nHardware Canucks reached out to Intel for comment and the company confirms that it could replicate some of the performance issues and that it is actively looking into the issue. How long a fix might take entirely depends on if the issue is a singular one that can be resolved with a few small changes, or if each game and older system is affected in a different way. We\u2019ll have to wait on further word from Intel to find out.\n\nIn the meantime, the Intel Arc B580 remains a decent budget upgrade for those on more modern systems. However, both AMD and Intel are set to announce brand new lines of gaming GPUs next week at the CES 2025 trade show, so we could see the whole graphics card market get shaken up, depending on what they announce. The rumors point to the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and Nvidia RTX 5000 series, but we\u2019ll know more in a couple of days.",

Next-gen Nova Lake and Razer Lake PCI IDs appear on Linux (via @GawroskiT), not only validating the naming scheme but also confirming particular lineups, such as the Nova Lake-H (NVL-H) and Nova Lake-S (NVL-S).\n\nIntel IDs in kernel:\n\nIntel nova lake / nvl-h / nvl-s (desktop)\n\nIntel razor lake / rzl-h / rzl-m pic.twitter.com/rtEdkIjt1h \u2014 Tomasz Gawro\u0144ski (@GawroskiT) January 3, 2025\n\nWell, details around the mentioned CPU lineups are quite confined for now, but based on previous rumors, Intel's Nova Lake will be the true successor to the Arrow Lake-S lineup and should be part of the \"Core Ultra 400\" series, given that Team Blue stays consistent with the naming scheme here. In terms of specifications, Nova Lake, in general, is said to feature either Intel's 14A process or TSMC's 2nm, depending upon how both of the nodes pan out.\n\nWe recently saw a leak from Dell about Nova Lake-H SKUs, confirming 20W, 40W, and 80W TDP options, and that's the only piece of information that hints about the capabilities of the next-gen mobile lineup. As far as Razer Lake is concerned, in a previous report, we discussed how Razer Lake-S will succeed Nova Lake-S, and as far as specific details are concerned, we are currently clueless about what to expect with the lineup, apart from the fact that it will have S, M, and H series SKUs.\n\nFor release dates, it can be assumed that Intel's Nova Lake is slated for launch by 2026, while Razer Lake could appear by 2027, depending upon how Team Blue adjusts its future roadmap. Given the newest PCI ID listing, it's safe to say that development is already in progress, which is exciting to see.\n\nIntel Desktop CPU Generations Comparison:",

And we all realized our \"rockstar\" coders were actually ticking time bombs waiting to blow up our security infrastructure? Yeah, that 2024.\n\nBefore we dive headfirst into the chaos that's sure to be 2025, let's take a hot sec to revisit the top five stories that had everyone in the CDOTrends-sphere talking (and low-key panicking) last year. You know, the ones that broke the internet, blew up our Twitter feeds, and had us all questioning our life choices.\n\n1. Anaconda's legal hissy fit: Open source? Not so fast!\n\nRemember the good old days when open source meant, well, open? Apparently, Anaconda missed that memo. They decided to lawyer up and go after anyone with a decent-sized team (200+ in size) using their beloved Jupyter Notebook and RStudio. Government agencies? Research labs? Big tech companies like Intel? All fair game in Anaconda's quest for world domination (or at least, a fatter bottom line).\n\nCue the collective gasp from the data science community. Was this a legit move to protect their IP, or just a cash grab? The jury's still out on that one, but one thing's for sure: it definitely threw some shade on the whole \"open source\" concept.\n\nOur take: Anaconda's move might just be the tip of the iceberg. Expect more companies to re-evaluate their open source strategies, and maybe even start charging for those \"free\" tools we've all come to rely on. Pro-tip: Look out for those AI platforms too, which are already introducing sky-high prices.\n\nRead the article again.\n\n2. Chip Wars: Intel and AMD vs. the NVIDIA Death Star\n\nEarly 2024 saw Intel and AMD stepping up to challenge NVIDIA's reign over the AI chip market. Intel's Gaudi and AMD's MI300X (with OpenAI's blessing, no less) promised to be faster, better, and all-around more awesome. On paper, they were poised to dethrone the reigning champ.\n\nBut let's be real, it's 2025 and we're all still talking about NVIDIA. Did Intel and AMD fizzle out? Did NVIDIA pull some Jedi mind tricks on the market? Or are we just creatures of habit, clinging to the familiar even when something shinier comes along?\n\nOur take: NVIDIA might be on top now, but Intel and AMD aren't going down without a fight. Expect more innovation, more competition, chip-slinging and maybe even some surprise contenders entering the ring.\n\nRead the article again.\n\n3. Musk vs. Lidar: From \"fool's errand\" to \"secret weapon\"\n\nAh, Elon Musk. Never one to shy away from a hot take, especially when it comes to throwing shade at Lidar. \"Fool's errand,\" \"freaking stupid\" \u2013 he didn't hold back. But then, plot twist! Tesla, Musk\u2019s own baby, turns out to be Luminar's (a Lidar company) biggest customer.\n\nSo, did Musk have a change of heart? Was this a classic case of \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\"? Or was it all just a master plan to troll us all along? Honestly, with Musk, it could be anything.\n\nOur take: Love him or hate him, Musk's embrace of Lidar is a sign of things to come. Expect to see this tech popping up everywhere, from self-driving cars and robotic vacuum cleaners and delivery drones to... who knows what else?\n\nRead the article again.\n\n4. AI hits a wall: Data sovereignty strikes back\n\nJust when we thought AI was about to take over the world, it got hit with a dose of reality: data sovereignty laws. Turns out, you can't just go gallivanting around the globe with your AI models, hoovering up data like it's an all-you-can-eat buffet.\n\nSuddenly, companies found themselves navigating a minefield of regulations, trying to keep their AI ambitions in check while avoiding hefty fines and legal nightmares. The message was clear: innovate responsibly, or risk your AI becoming an outlaw.\n\nOur take: Companies will need to get serious about data governance and compliance if they want to play in the global AI arena. Expect to see more tools and frameworks emerge to help navigate this complex landscape.\n\nRead the article again.\n\n5. The coder next door: Your newest security nightmare\n\nWe've all heard the horror stories of hackers stealing millions, holding data hostage, and generally wreaking havoc. But in 2024, a new villain emerged: the unassuming coder sitting next to you.\n\nTurns out, in our rush to embrace DevOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), we've been handing out admin privileges like candy. Developers now have the keys to the kingdom, and hackers are taking notice. The solution? Treat your coders like the high-privilege users they are, and lock down their access before they accidentally (or intentionally) bring the whole system crashing down.\n\nOur take: The days of \"it won't happen to me\" are over. Every developer, every employee, is a potential security risk. Expect to see a renewed focus on identity management, zero trust security, zero standing privilege and better security awareness training.\n\nRead the article again.\n\nSo, what does this all mean for 2025?\n\nThese five stories weren't just fleeting trends; they were wake-up calls, highlighting the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.\n\n2025 is shaping up to be another wild ride. So buckle up, buttercup, and get ready for a year of innovation, disruption, and maybe even a few more Elon Musk U-turns. Happy new year!\n\nImage credit: iStockphoto/Deagreez",

There are also some quirks to the system.\n\nWe included this in a video here where we also covered the Beelink SER9:\n\nWe always suggest opening this in its own tab, browser, or app for the best viewing experience. Beelink sent us this unit to review.\n\nIf you just want to do a price check, you can find the unit on Amazon here: Affiliate link.\n\nBeelink GTi12 Ultra Mini PC Review External Overview\n\nThe Beelink GTi12 Ultra has one of the more usable front I/O selections we have seen recently. Along the top are four holes for a microphone array. There are USB 3.2 Gen2 USB ports in both Type-A and Type-C variants. We also get an audio jack on the front. Something we do not get is labels on the ports which needs to happen.\n\nSomething we find super useful is a built-in SD card reader.\n\nThe power button also has a fingerprint reader for biometric authentication.\n\nThe sides are featureless metal expanses.\n\nThe top of the rear is dominated by cooling. Below the cooling we have a nice port selection. Four USB Type-A ports are all USB 3.2 Gen2 10Gbps ports. There is another Type-C port that is a Thunderbolt 4 port for adding even more like the Anker 778 Thunderbolt 4 Dock Mini-Review, QNAP TBS-h574TX, or even a 10GbE adapter. Below that is an audio jack.\n\nSoemthing very different here is that we get an AC input into the system. A big feature here is the internal power supply.\n\nWe also get a HDMI and a DisplayPort when paired with the Thunderbolt port gives us three display outputs.\n\nFor networking, we get dual 2.5GbE which is always nice.\n\nOn the bottom, we get a vent, nice large rubber feet, and a Beelink pull tab.\n\nThe new feature is the slot that allows us to connect to the Beelink EX GPU Dock.\n\nNext, let us get inside the system.",

            "content": "CES doesn\u2019t just introduce the world to a new generation of consumer electronics, but new PC hardware as well. CES 2025 should be the opportunity for both Intel and AMD to launch new mobile processors for 2025 laptops, with possibly Qualcomm discussing new PC CPUs, too.\n\nIntel is a virtual lock to launch its Core H- and -HX series of Arrow Lake mobile processors for gaming laptops at January\u2019s CES show in Las Vegas, both from its own statements and LG\u2019s announcement of its new \u201cArrow Lake\u201d laptops.\n\nThe momentum has clearly swung to AMD, however, which has announced a launch date of January 6, 2025 for new PC and graphics products. Here, we\u2019re expecting AMD to announce both new desktop processors \u2014 including new iterations of its fantastic Ryzen 9000X3D gaming processors \u2014 but also \u201cStrix Halo\u201d chips with ultra-powerful integrated graphics aimed at the mobile gaming market. Could we even see additional CPUs for handhelds, too? It\u2019s likely.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s crystal ball is a bit murkier, but remember: Qualcomm has already announced its next-generation Oryon CPU cores for smartphones. Eventually, we expect them to debut inside of a PC processor, too.\n\nFurther reading: The next generation of PC graphics will kick off at CES 2025\n\nIntel\u2019s mobile Arrow Lake debuts\n\nAnyone who\u2019s followed the laptop market knows that Intel still commands a decided advantage over AMD in terms of the number of devices available, especially in gaming. This isn\u2019t likely to change within 2025. In fact, you can make the argument that Intel\u2019s decision to prioritize low power over high performance with its Arrow Lake desktop processors \u2014 which contributed to a steep drop in Intel desktop market share in 2024 \u2014 might be viewed more favorably in notebooks which can benefit from longer battery life. That argument makes more sense backing up a Core H-series part, which isn\u2019t as desperate for performance as a Core HX chip is.\n\nIntel\n\nRegardless, leaks have already suggested that these new Core Ultra (Arrow Lake) mobile chips will feature five new models, from the Core Ultra 5 225H on up to the Core Ultra 9 285H, with a total of 6 P-cores, 8 E-cores, and a pair of the new Low Power Efficiency cores, with no hyperthreading. The same leaker suggests that Intel\u2019s Core HX series could lead with a 24-core 285X flagship (8 P-cores, 16 E-cores, with no dedicated low-power efficiency cores) on down to the 235HX. It\u2019s also suggested that these new HX chips will use older Xe GPUs for integrated graphics, in part because they\u2019re traditionally paired with discrete GPUs.\n\nMoore\u2019s Law is Dead, which has an iffy reputation among leakers, has suggested (via Notebookcheck.net) that Arrow Lake will be 14 percent faster than the 13th-gen Raptor Lake architecture using the Cinebench benchmark, but with power consumption that is surprisingly about the same.\n\nLast year saw Intel\u2019s Core HX go up against the Core Ultra as a two-pronged approach to productivity and gaming performance. Expect Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake to do the same in 20525. Mark Hachman / IDG\n\nWhat does seem to be the case, however, is that Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake chips won\u2019t be going away. So 2025\u2019s notebook lineup will likely include productivity laptops that run on Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake, with the Arrow Lake architecture taking over on the gaming and performance front. Unfortunately, they\u2019ll all be using similar Core Ultra branding, so you\u2019ll need to pay attention.\n\nAMD\u2019s cavalcade of CPUs\n\nAs someone who touches more notebooks than desktops, AMD\u2019s Strix Halo definitely interests me. Whether intentionally or not, AMD has made an effort to keep up with its competition in the low-power notebook space, but still finds itself atop the heap in terms of performance. And there\u2019s definitely something to be said for that, as a number of customers simply prefer buying the fastest processor available for gaming and otherwise.\n\nOfficially, AMD\u2019s Strix Point should be named the Ryzen AI Max, complementing the low-power Ryzen AI 300 family with a Ryzen AI Max 395+ processor. A leaker (Golden Pig Upgrade Pack \u2014 where do these leakers come up with these names?) suggests via Tom\u2019s Hardware that we could see AMD announce three processors: the 16-core Ryzen AI Max+ 395, the 12-core Ryzen AI Max 390, and the 8-core Ryzen AI Max 385. Strix Halo is said to include a pair of Zen 5 CCDs with a LPDDR5X memory interface, too.\n\nIt\u2019s tie for AMD\u2019s Strix Point to give way to Strix Halo. MSI\n\nThe question, as Tom\u2019s suggests, will be whether AMD attaches a large GPU \u2014 the AI Max+ 395 is said to have an RDNA 3.5-based GPU with 2560 stream processors, which would massively outperform an ordinary Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 or \u201cStrix Point\u201d processor. The question is whether PC makers will also attach a discrete GPU, or simply let the APU\u2019s graphics horsepower carry the load. But that may come at a cost, with power climbing to 120W to 130W all by itself.\n\nThe limited launch of the single AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D also points to more to come on the desktop front. The 9800X3D chip obliterated the competition \u2014 but it was a single chip! That\u2019s led to suggestions that AMD has a 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X3D and a 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D chip waiting to be announced by AMD at CES, as a loose-lipped Asus executive indicated. If nothing else, that should help alleviate AMD\u2019s supply crunch, which has squeezed supplies of the chip since launch.\n\nCPUs are typically considered part of one of two categories: desktop, and mobile. But the mobile definition has expanded to include both laptops as well as handheld gaming PCs. In the latter category, as in consoles, AMD has dominated. But Intel is expected to make a push into the category with Lunar Lake at CES. AMD, meanwhile, is expected to respond with the Ryzen Z2, the sequel to the Ryzen Z1 and Z1 Extreme chip for handheld PCs.\n\nHandheld PCs are the nw battleground for mobile CPUs. PCWelt/Asus/Amazon\n\nAMD\u2019s Z1 and Z1 Extreme, launched in 2023, are based on the Zen 4 architecture; the Z1 included six primary cores and 12 threads, with 4 RDNA 3 graphics units. The Extreme variant increased the number of cores from six to eight, but tripled the RDNA 3 units to a total of twelve.\n\nDetails on the upcoming chips are a little skimpy, but we could see the Z2 Extreme, the \u201cvanilla\u201d Z2, and the Z2G or Z2 Go. The Extreme is said to boast eight CPU cores (3 Zen 5, 5 Zen5c) with 12 CUs based on the Strix Point and RDNA 3.5 GPU architecture. The \u201cvanilla\u201d Z2 could also use eight cores and 12 CUs, based on AMD\u2019s Hawk Point graphics, while the \u201cG\u201d variant could be built around the older Ryzen 6000 and an RDNA 2 GPU. Again, while the features are all speculation and rumor, it does seem likely that AMD has something up its sleeve for the handheld PC market at CES.\n\nCould we see more AM4 and AM5 boards and chipsets announced at CES? That\u2019s possible, too. Either way, AMD should have a lot to talk about in just a few days.\n\nA Qualcomm conundrum\n\nWhile both AMD and Qualcomm will host press events on Jan. 6, Qualcomm has its fingers in enough pies to avoid needing to make a PC announcement at CES. Instead, I\u2019m expecting to hear more information (and spin) about Arm\u2019s litigation against Qualcomm, which was largely settled over the holidays in favor of Qualcomm. I interpreted that to mean that little has changed, and that Qualcomm can continue to sell Snapdragon processors without issue. But I\u2019d expect a formal clarification on that from Qualcomm chief executive Cristiano Amon from a CES podium.\n\nQualcomm spent the fall showing off its Snapdragon 8 Elite platform, but for smartphones. Anyron Copeman / Foundry\n\nIn October, Qualcomm launched an updated, second-generation Oryon CPU core as part of its Snapdragon 8 Elite platform for handheld PCs. Snapdragon 8 Elite reportedly consumes 44 percent less power while offering 45 percent more multi-core performance versus the previous Snapdragon 8 core, Qualcomm says. Eventually, I\u2019d expect, it will be the foundation for the next Snapdragon X Elite platform.\n\nI don\u2019t think this happens at CES 2025, however. It\u2019s more likely this takes place at Computex this summer, when Qualcomm has typically launched processors for new computing platforms. In the meantime, Qualcomm has done an admirable job working with developers and solving compatibility problems with the Windows on Arm platform, and this type of announcement seems likely for CES. We could also see a wave of new laptops powered by Qualcomm\u2019s more affordable Snapdragon X Plus chips, which were announced earlier this fall.\n\nNevertheless, this looks to be the busiest CES in some time, especially because Nvidia and AMD are expected to launch new GPUs, too. The PCWorld team is headed to Las Vegas this weekend to cover all the news as it happens. The holidays are over; the chip wars are heating up once again.

            "content": "As the NBA world steps into 2025, and into the final five weeks before the Feb. 6 trade deadline, trade discussions around the league will officially kick into gear.\n\nAnd while there have been a couple of deals so far -- both involving the rebuilding Brooklyn Nets -- it remains to be seen whether any superstar moves are going to happen, or whether there will be a series of smaller deals between now and the deadline.\n\nPlenty is happening on the court, too. The West-leading Oklahoma City Thunder begin a four-game stretch against the Eastern Conference's top three teams; the New York Knicks on Friday, the defending champion Boston Celtics on Sunday and the NBA-leading Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday before another meeting with New York on Jan. 10.\n\nLet's get into what other trades could be coming for Brooklyn, the latest in the Jimmy Butler-Miami Heat saga -- stoked by Thursday night's news that Butler wants a trade out of Miami -- and why the Knicks and Golden State Warriors have league GMs, executives and scouts buzzing for different reasons.\n\nJump to intel:\n\nNext steps in the Butler-Heat saga\n\nMore deals coming for Brooklyn?\n\nExecs on Knicks' run | Warriors' slide\n\nWhy scouts are buzzing about the Cavs\n\nWindhorst: Butler is in a slow-moving chess game with the Heat, and the latest maneuver came Thursday when, after dancing around the issue for several weeks, he directly made it clear to the Heat front office he wants to be traded.\n\nHere is where the rest of the NBA, especially teams that would have interest in trading for Butler, have their popcorn out. There is no executive in American sports like Pat Riley, as his Heat front office operates with a bluntness and strength toward star players that is not of this era.\n\nWhen rival teams saw the statement Riley released last week openly declaring the Heat would not be trading their franchise player, there was widespread reaction to the unorthodox but classic Riley move -- and to what could come next in this saga.\n\n\"That is how you project strength as an organization,\" one general manager told me.\n\nAdded a prominent agent: \"You cannot intimidate Pat Riley.\"\n\nBontemps: The focus was on the court Wednesday night, when Butler returned for the first time in nearly two weeks against the last-place New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nBut while Butler played, it wasn't exactly a commanding performance. Across 25 minutes, Butler had nine points on 3-for-5 shooting in Miami's 119-108 win and didn't play in the fourth quarter. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said postgame that he \"went with the group there in the fourth that was giving us the most and to see if that group could close it out.\"\n\nMultiple sources from around the league who watched the game thought Butler looked disengaged. He missed badly on a one-legged corner 3-pointer in the first quarter, didn't score until the end of the first half and had a usage rate of 12%.\n\nThen came Thursday's loss to the Indiana Pacers, during which Butler was minus-27 in 27 minutes and then declared after the game that he wants to find his \"joy\" again.\n\nCan he do that in Miami? \"Probably not,\" he told reporters.\n\nWindhorst: Riley has long been unafraid to tell his star players no. In 2010, when LeBron James hinted he wanted Riley to replace coach Erik Spoelstra, as told to author Ian Thomsen in the 2018 book \"The Soul of Basketball,\" Riley shut him down in the moment. Riley let Dwyane Wade walk in a contract dispute. There are many other examples over the decades. This Butler situation is going to be another chapter.\n\n\"The Heat make mistakes and sometimes have issues with players just like everyone else,\" the GM said. \"But they do not get pushed around.\"\n\nBontemps: For all the noise around a potential Butler trade, no one is more secure in their seat than Riley in Miami.\n\n\"You never want to get in a fight with someone who has nothing to lose,\" one rival executive told me. \"And Pat has nothing to lose.\"\n\nThe other thing to consider: The argument of \"it's better to get something than nothing\" no longer applies in today's NBA. As we wrote last month, Miami does not want to be stuck with money it can't move on its books in a Butler trade.\n\nThe flexibility the LA Clippers created in letting Paul George walk this summer marks a viable path for the Heat -- presuming no one meets their asking price for Butler's services.\n\nWas Brooklyn's flurry of moves a sign of things to come?\n\nBontemps: In the first two weeks since the unofficial start of trade season Dec. 15, we have seen a pair of trades, both involving the Nets and following a similar pattern.\n\nBoth deals -- guard Dennis Schroder to the Golden State Warriors, and two-way forward Dorian Finney-Smith to the Los Angeles Lakers -- involved veterans on midtier contracts. Schroder is making $13 million, while Finney-Smith is making $14.9 million with a $15.3 million player option for next season.\n\nAnd neither deal involved a first-round pick, which removed the hurdle many contending teams are facing as they compete for players with limited first-round picks to offer in trades.\n\nWindhorst: The Nets were 10-15 when they traded Dennis Schroder and are 3-9 since. They made their second trade, dealing Finney-Smith to the Lakers, then promptly lost to the Toronto Raptors, who were on an 11-game losing streak and whose previous six defeats were by an average of 26 points (they did pull out a quality win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday). More trades might be coming as they position for the draft.\n\nNets wing Cameron Johnson could be one of the more coveted players leading into the deadline. He's 6-foot-8 and regarded as a good and versatile defender who is averaging a career-high 19 points and shooting a career-best 43% on 3-pointers.\n\nHowever, these talks are expected to be more complex than Brooklyn's previous deals. The Finney-Smith trade led to a bidding war between the Lakers and the Memphis Grizzlies, with hard feelings emanating from both the Grizzlies and the Nets for the way it played out. Johnson has many more suitors, and the Nets have made it clear it will be a steeper price to get Johnson, league sources told ESPN.\n\nOne of the factors is that the Nets, currently projected to have more than $60 million in cap space in the summer, are planning on going star searching either in free agency or by using that room to acquire a big name via trade. Brooklyn has made it known it sees Johnson as either a very good fit as a role player next to a star or an attractive player to use in a trade to get that star, sources said. The point being, the price is higher because the Nets don't have to trade Johnson.\n\n\"That's all good to say, but they'll trade him if they get what they want,\" a rival executive said. \"They like him as a player and a person and all that, but they built his contract specifically to be able to trade him by next summer.\"\n\nJohnson's deal, signed in 2023, reduces by $2 million next season, ideal for a contending team managing salary cap challenges. He has two years and $43 million left after this season.",

Artificial intelligence has become an increasing part of many consumers' lives, but it's always either lived in the cloud or required a big, power-hungry GPU to process efficiently. However, with the advent of Snapdragon X1 Elite PCs this summer, and shortly after Intel's Lunar Lake Core Ultra processor platform, local AI is here for everyone. In early September, Lenovo announced its AI PC collaboration with Intel: the Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition, and today it's here and retail ready.We typically have enjoyed many of Lenovo Yoga laptops that we've tested, and that's due in large part to their lightweight designs, good performance, quality keyboards, and impressive displays. Upgrading Intel's Meteor Lake CPUs the last generation had with Intel's Core Ultra 200v processors with their high-performance NPUs and greatly enhanced compute and graphics processing capabilities seems like a recipe for success, so let's dig in and find out. Meet the all new Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Gen 9 15-inch Aura Edition.As we've already given away, Lenovo has updated the new Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition the latest ultraportable-focused CPUs from Intel's Lunar Lake family, Core Ultra 200V complete with its more powerful neural processing unit. In this case, we have a Core Ultra 7 256V with four Lion Cove performance CPU cores that max out at 4.8 GHz and four Skymont low-power efficient cores that hit a top speed of 3.7 GHz, and 12 MB of L3 cache. We also bid adieu to HyperThreading, something we talked about at great length in our Lunar Lake architecture deep dive In this generation, Intel chose to strap the CPU's memory directly to the CPU package. The Core 7 Ultra 256V has 16 GB of LPDDR5x-8533. We're also treated to a greatly enhanced Xe2 graphics engine on board here, which has been borrowed from Intel's upcoming Arc Battlemage family. It's not going to magically turn the Yoga 7i Slim into a gaming powerhouse, but it should provide playable frame rates at lower graphics settings in modern games, which would be a big boon on the go.The Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition comes equipped with a 1 TB M.2 NVMe SSD with a PCI Express 4.0 x4 link for snappy storage. Wireless networking is handled by an Intel BE201 Wi-Fi 7 module that also supplies Bluetooth 5.4 to a dual-antenna array configured for 2x2 MIMO. A capacious 70 Watt-hour battery and 65-Watt USB-C charger round out this system's high level specs.The Yoga Slim 7i comes in a sleek Luna Gray enclosure that uses 50% recycled aluminum in the top and bottom that is stamped, sandblasted for texture, and then anodized. Build quality is very stable without any creaking and minimal flex. Thia Yoga feels great in the hand, and reminds us that this is a premium device, not a plastic budget notebook.The top edge of the display houses the included 1080p webcam with a little \"lip\" that allows for easily opening the lid. Subjectively (and backed up by the measurements above) the Yoga Slim 7i feels very thin, and its relatively light 3.2 lb weight for its footprint makes it easy to toss into a backpack and take on the go.Opening that lid to gaze at the 15.3\" display smooth, and the hinge has just enough resistance to hold the lid up. As for the display itself, it's a 16:10 IPS display with a resolution of 2,880 x 1,800 120 Hz that supports 100% of the DCI-P3 color space. High refresh rate, great color reproduction, 500 nits maximum brightness, and multi-touch support -- what more could you want? Maybe the optional 2.8k OLED can entice you, although that OLED option gives up touch capabilities. Both options can come in either glossy or matte anti-reflective finishes.The integrated webcam maxes out at a 16:9 1080p for both photos and video. Subjectively, the quality is solid for what has quickly become a midrange spec in a world where the competition has 5 MP sensors and Apple strapped a 12 MP camera to the latest M4 family of MacBooks Pro. Still, this camera is more than sufficient for video chats and non-stop Zoom meetings. While there's no physical shutter, there is a electronic shutter that turns off the camera on the side of the notebook. The system's dual microphone array cancels noise effectively and callers could hear us clearly.Four stereo speakers are split between two high-frequency tweeters and mid-range drivers, and this array carries Dolby Atmos certification. That said, these are still laptop speakers and lack definition and volume in the low frequency range, so don't expect them to rumble your seat. They're sufficient for those video calls, but they're also sufficient for casual games and some YouTube video. For anything else, we found that we'd definitely prefer some decent headphones, and there's a combination jack to accommodate those, thankfully.The keyboards in most high-end Lenovo laptops are typically pretty good laptop keyboards, and the Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition's is no exception. There's enough travel to feel tactile and a satisfying bump on the way down. We wrote the whole review on the Yoga, and as you know I get kind of wordy, so that's a lot of testing behind it. The trackpad is relatively large, and has an integrated button. It also supports all the gestures and multi-taps that one would expect from a modern Windows notebook as well.External expansion is relatively light in the Yoga Slim 7i, and that's compounded by the fact that one of just two USB-C ports has to be used by the charger. Those two ports do support Thunderbolt 4, including PCI-Express, USB 4.0, USB-C Power Delivery, and DisplayPort 1.4. There's also an HDMI port that supports 4K at 60 Hz, a single USB-A connector for 5 Gbps USB 3.2 Gen 1, and that aforementioned headphone jack. In a 15\" notebook with the footprint of the Yoga, we would have hoped for a card reader slot of some sort too.The Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition came to us running Windows 11 Home with update 24H2 out of the box, which is needed for Windows 11's Copilot+ features. Before we run any tests, we ensure that Windows is fully up to date and that the drivers that can be updated (including graphics drivers with Intel's ARC driver package), so that performance is as bug-free and well-optimized as possible.Lenovo's software config is pretty sparse beyond that, which we appreciate in a laptop in this price range. The Lenovo Vantage utility provides quick access to support and system firmware updates. As part of the Aura Edition software loadout, Vantage includes an on-device AI trained on documentation that can help answer common questions.Vantage can also help you get started with Smart Share, which is an app for both iOS and Android devices to move media between PC and phone, mirror the phone screen, and manage notifications. This competes with a variety of other mirroring and sharing technologies, such as Microsoft's Your Phone app, Samsung's own screen mirroring tools, and third-party applications like Vysor.Vantage is also is home to Lenovo's Smart Modes. There are a variety of different performance modes, but in addition to that, Vantage uses on-device AI to enable a variety of use cases. For instance, the Shield mode engages the webcam and other sensors in order to detect peeping toms that might be looking over your shoulder at the local Starbucks. Attention mode will disable notifications, turn down the volume, and even put the brakes on websites it deems can distract you for long periods of time so that you can focus on what needs to be done. Collaboration mode uses computer vision to set up camera auto-framing and video backgrounds when you're in video meetings.These settings can be turned on in the Vantage application and also be bound to hotkeys so they can be turned on and off without switching gears. Without the Intel Core Ultra 7 256V's onboard NPU, these options either may not be possible, or may require additional power if they have to engage the integrated GPU. The NPU can be used for other things as well, such as Lenovo's Smart Care subscription service that can automatically detect when applications are misbehaving and perform behavior-based malware scans.Lenovo's AI can optionally watch what you're doing on the machine and automatically select what it feels is the best mode for a given task, though we always test on the default power settings. Incidentally, Highest Performance didn't really gain us much in the way of performance in any benchmark other than a short burst up front. We'll talk about cooling later on, but it seems like we hit a thermal or power wall pretty quickly and performance comes back to normal.However, as you'll see on the next page, Balance mode is still pretty good. So let's get to the performance benchmarks, shall we?",

            "content": "It's time to round up the best CPUs on the market. After countless CPU reviews, benchmarks, retests, and revisits, we've put it all together into a single article to make your CPU shopping as straightforward as possible.\n\nWhether you're upgrading your PC or building a new one, choosing the right processor can be overwhelming, given the sheer number of options available. In this guide, we've done the heavy lifting for you by narrowing down the choices to the best options across five key categories that we believe effectively cover the market from top to bottom. Admittedly, there is no 5800X3D or 5700X3D pick here, which might draw some criticism upfront.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning, there are a lot of CPUs currently on sale, but you can ignore the vast majority of them as they simply don't make sense for one reason or another, or the use case is just too niche. For example, we're often asked if it's worth getting one of AMD's APU's, such as the Ryzen 7 8700G or 8600G, but for desktop users, especially those planning on using a discrete GPU, they don't make sense mostly because the CPU portion is so weak.\n\nFrom budget-friendly processors to core-heavy monsters, we'll help you find the ideal CPU for your specific needs, whether it's productivity, gaming, or both. Let's dive in.\n\nBest CPU, Entry-Level Platform Upgrade\n\nIntel Core i5-12400F In numbers $111 on Amazon Price: User Reviews: 9.4 Starting with the most affordable option, our recommendation for the best value entry-level CPU depends on whether you're upgrading your CPU, motherboard, and possibly memory, or building an entirely new PC. These scenarios have different budget considerations. If you're upgrading your platform, the most cost-effective option right now is the Intel Core i5-12400F. This is the CPU we recommend for those looking to spend as little as possible, which also means pairing it with DDR4 memory. In the past, we recommended the Core i3-12100F, which is currently priced at just $75. However, this quad-core model is starting to struggle in newer games. As a result, we advise spending a bit more on the 6-core 12400F, which can now be found for $110. The 12400F has been one of Intel's most popular processors in recent years because it is both highly affordable and sufficiently powerful. The main drawback is that you're investing in a dead platform with LGA1700, so it only makes sense if you stick with cheaper DDR4 memory. In total, you can get the 12400F, a DDR4 LGA1700 motherboard, and a 32GB kit of DDR4-3600 memory for around $250 \u2013 a hard-to-beat value. The only real alternative here is AMD's AM4 platform, which is arguably one of the best PC platforms ever created. However, the Ryzen 5 5600, which also costs $110, is slower than the Core i5, making the 12400F our clear recommendation. It's also important to note that there's no point in spending additional money on either Intel's LGA1700 or AMD's AM4 platforms, as they are effectively end-of-life. If your budget allows, you should focus on a current platform instead. Speaking of which, let's explore that next. Back to top \u25b5\n\nBest CPU for a New Gaming PC\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 7600 In numbers $184 on Amazon Price: User Reviews: 9.6 For those with a tighter budget who are building an entry-level PC they hope to keep for many years, we recommend spending a little extra on the CPU, motherboard, and memory by choosing the Ryzen 5 7600. The Ryzen 5 7600 is a significantly faster CPU than the Core i5-12400F, even though both are 6-core processors. In gaming performance, the 7600 is nearly 20% faster, and that advantage grows to almost 30% if the Core i5 is paired with DDR4 memory instead of high-speed DDR5. Of course, the Ryzen 5 processor costs more \u2013 about 80% more if you compare just the CPU prices, and 60% more when factoring in motherboard and memory costs. However, when building an entire budget PC, the total cost difference shrinks. A complete Core i5 system might cost around $730, while the Ryzen 5 system could come in at $890. This means the Ryzen 5 costs roughly 20% more, and in the worst-case scenario, it offers the same cost per frame while delivering far better overall performance with the AMD platform. Additionally, the Ryzen 5 7600 offers a platform that will age better, thanks in part to the increased bandwidth provided by DDR5 memory. This platform is almost certain to offer a solid upgrade path in the future. While DDR5 memory can also be paired with the Core i5-12400F, doing so undermines the value of that CPU, making it a less financially viable option. For those building a new PC or upgrading to a more modern platform, we recommend the Ryzen 5 7600 or its Chinese counterpart, the 7500F, available on AliExpress. If you are shopping on AliExpress, keep in mind that not only are Ryzen CPUs often cheaper, but the Core i5-12400F is currently available for as little as $80. Back to top \u25b5\n\nBest Value Mid-Range CPU\n\nBest Gaming CPU\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D In numbers $479 on Amazon Price: User Reviews: 9.4 There's no room for debate here: the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is hands down the best gaming CPU money can buy right now. The only issue with this CPU is its availability. At $480, it's not ridiculously expensive considering it's the very best, but demand from gamers is extremely high. As a result, weeks after its release and it remains incredibly difficult to find. The next best thing is the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, but that too is mostly out of stock and not worth paying a premium for. The best course of action is to be patient and wait for the 9800X3D to become more readily available. This reflects the current state of the PC hardware market: most products you don't want to buy because they're underwhelming, and the few great ones are nearly impossible to get. Perhaps the industry should focus on making fewer disappointing products \u2013 but surely it's not that simple. Anyway, the 9800X3D is incredibly popular because it is undeniably the best of the best, and gamers naturally gravitate toward the top-performing hardware. That said, while the 9800X3D is excellent, not everyone needs it. For many gamers, the Ryzen 7 7700 will perform just as well and offer significantly better value. This is primarily because, in most cases, gaming performance is limited by the GPU rather than the CPU. With a modern and powerful processor like the Ryzen 7 7700, your frame rate will almost always be constrained by the GPU long before the CPU becomes a bottleneck. Of course, there are exceptions \u2013 competitive shooters, strategy games, city builders, and turn-based games can sometimes be more CPU-intensive. However, for the vast majority of gamers, the GPU will remain the limiting factor. Keep this in mind when deciding whether the 9800X3D is truly necessary for your setup.

            "content": "The 10 Biggest Intel News Stories Of 2024 While Intel faced significant challenges this year ranging from the abrupt retirement of CEO Pat Gelsinger to massive job cuts, the semiconductor giant continued to push forward with new products such as the Intel Core 200V series as well as the Intel Foundry business.\n\nIntel ended 2024 in a significantly different position than when it started the year. A large part of that was because of the abrupt retirement of Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger at the beginning of December, but it also had to do with the fact that the semiconductor giant had to cut over 15,000 jobs and more than $10 billion in costs in the second half of the year. [Related: The 10 Biggest Nvidia News Stories Of 2024] The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company also saw big changes in channel leadership multiple times this year, most notably the global channel chief role. This was all happening as Intel faced growing competition across multiple fronts, including in the PC and cloud infrastructure markets where it has traditionally held dominance. But despite all the challenges the chipmaker faced, it continued to push forward with new products such as the Intel Core 200V series and Gaudi 3 and the Intel Foundry contract chip manufacturing business that was championed by Gelsinger during his tenure as CEO. These developments helped make up the 10 biggest Intel stories of 2024. What follows are the most important things you should know about each development.\n\n10. Interim Intel Co-CEOs Outline Post-Gelsinger Strategy Three days after the sudden retirement of Gelsinger on Dec. 1, interim co-CEO David Zinsner (pictured) said the semiconductor giant\u2019s \u201ccore strategy remains intact\u201d while noting a few tweaks to its product and manufacturing businesses. Zinsner said at a Dec. 4 investor event that Intel\u2019s board of directors wants company leadership to put an \u201cemphasis on execution around the product side of the business,\u201d referring to the business units for chip products such as the Xeon and Core processors. Doing this, he added, will ensure the success of Intel Foundry, the company\u2019s contract chip manufacturing business that was separated from the products group this year. The board also wants Intel to push for more incremental returns on the massive investments the semiconductor giant has put into its manufacturing operations, according to Zinsner, who is also Intel\u2019s CFO. \u201cI\u2019d say the one thing that has definitely come out of the way the board\u2019s thinking about this is they do recognize and have pushed us that, \u2018Hey, we made a lot of investment from a capital perspective in Foundry, and we need to start seeing some incremental [return on invested capital] on those investments,\u2019 and so, and that's what we\u2019re committed to do. That\u2019s going to be one of my major focuses,\u201d he said. A little more than a week later, on Dec. 12, Michelle Johnston Holthaus joined Zinsner at another investor conference in their first public appearance together as Intel\u2019s interim co-CEOs and gave blunt assessments of Intel\u2019s accelerator chip and server CPU efforts while painting a rosier picture of its PC chip strategy. \u201cOn the data center side, we have a lot of work to do there. But on the client side, our say-do ratio for the last four years has been very good,\u201d said Holthaus, who had led Intel\u2019s Client Computing Group for more than two years before. As for Intel\u2019s accelerator chip strategy, Holthaus said the company\u2019s Gaudi chips do \u201cnot allow me to get to the masses\u201d and that the successor to the recently launched Gaudi 3, code-named Falcon Shores, will not be \u201cwonderful\u201d but instead a \u201cgood first step.\u201d\n\n9. Intel Foundry Launches With Microsoft As First Marquee Customer Intel in February marked the official launch of its contract chip manufacturing business, Intel Foundry, and named Microsoft as a marquee customer. At the launch event, the chipmaker called Intel Foundry the \u201cworld\u2019s first systems foundry\u201d for the AI era, reiterated its goal of displacing Samsung to become the world\u2019s second-largest foundry by 2030 and revealed an expanded process road map. Intel Foundry was a key part of Gelsinger\u2019s comeback plan, which called for a massive expansion in manufacturing capacity in the West and an acceleration of advanced chip-making capabilities to support the revitalized foundry effort. At the time, the company said that its Intel 3 process is ready for high-volume manufacturing while the last two nodes on its node acceleration plan\u2014Intel 20A and Intel 18A\u2014are on track to become ready for manufacturing this year. The company has said that it expects Intel 18A to give Intel an edge over Asian foundry rivals TSMC and Samsung by 2025, when Intel plans to start using the node for high-volume manufacturing. (In September, the company said it no longer planned to commercialize Intel 20A and would instead focus on Intel 18A for 2025.) In a process road map update, Intel said it will follow up Intel 18A with Intel 14A, which is expected to enter commercialization in late 2026 and slated to be the first node to use an advanced form of lithography called High NA EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet). Intel also disclosed that it\u2019s developing modified versions of Intel 3, Intel 18 and Intel 14A that have been optimized to improve performance, introduce new features or implement its Foveros Direct 3-D stacking technology for advanced chip designs. Microsoft confirmed that it will become an Intel Foundry customer for a chip design it plans to manufacture on the Intel 18A process. \u201cWe are in the midst of a very exciting platform shift that will fundamentally transform productivity for every individual organization and the entire industry,\u201d Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. \u201cTo achieve this vision, we need a reliable supply of the most advanced, high-performance and high-quality semiconductors. That\u2019s why we are so excited to work with Intel Foundry, and why we have chosen a chip design that we plan to produce on the Intel 18A process,\u201d he added.\n\n8. Intel Makes Foundry Independent, Names AWS Foundry Customer Gelsinger said in a September update that the company plans to turn its contract chip manufacturing business into an independent subsidiary among other changes he laid out that will help it save billions of dollars and bounce back financially. Gelsinger also highlighted a new \u201cmultiyear, multibillion-dollar framework\u201d where Intel will design and manufacture custom chips for Amazon Web Services. In the Sept. 21 letter to employees, made public on Intel\u2019s website, he said turning Intel Foundry into an independent subsidiary will give customers and suppliers \u201cclearer separation and independence from the rest of Intel,\u201d namely its product businesses, like the Data Center and AI Group and the Client Computing Group. The CEO said at the time that the move will also give Intel the ability to raise funding from outside groups and \u201coptimize the capital structure of each business to maximize growth and shareholder value creation.\u201d While this will not result any leadership changes for Intel Foundry, the contract chip-making business will gain an operating board that includes independent directors as part of the semiconductor giant\u2019s push for \u201cgreater transparency, optimization and accountability across the business,\u201d according to Gelsinger. When Intel marked the official launch of Intel Foundry in February, the company emphasized that its decision to financially separate the contract chip-making division from its chip design businesses will show potential and existing customers that Intel Foundry is independent from the rest of intel. Intel called the new AWS chip design and manufacturing deal a \u201csignificant expansion\u201d of their \u201clongstanding strategic collaboration.\u201d As part of the deal, Intel plans to manufacture an AI fabric chip for AWS on Intel 18A, which is the advanced chip-making node that the semiconductor giant has said will allow it to leapfrog Asian foundry giants TSMC and Samsung in processor performance by next year as part of Gelsinger\u2019s comeback plan. The chipmaker said it also plans to manufacture a custom Xeon 6 chip on the Intel 3 node, which entered mass-manufacturing this year. The two companies said the deal leaves open the possibility for Intel to work with AWS on additional custom chip designs as well as existing Intel designs using Intel 18A and next-generation nodes like Intel 18AP and Intel 14A.\n\n7. Intel Faces Growing Competition In PC, Cloud Markets Intel faced growing competition this year across multiple fronts, including in the PC and cloud infrastructure markets where it has traditionally held dominance. In the PC market, Qualcomm made a revitalized push with the June launch of its Snapdragon X processors, which were the first chips to power laptops from several OEMs in Microsoft\u2019s Copilot+ PC program. Meanwhile, Intel didn\u2019t release processors that were compatible with Copilot+ PCs until September, and Microsoft only made Copilot+ features available to Windows Insider Community members for testing in December. At the same time, AMD ramped up its PC offerings this year with the launch of the Ryzen AI 300 series for laptops and the Ryzen 9000 series for desktops. In the data center and cloud infrastructure markets, AMD marked the launch of its fifth-generation EPYC \u201cTurin\u201d processors in October, calling the lineup the \u201cworld\u2019s best server CPU for enterprise, AI and cloud.\u201d Elsewhere, Intel\u2019s largest cloud computing processors all introduced new Arm-based CPUs this year, with AWS launching instances powered by its new Graviton4 chip in July, Google Cloud revealing its Axion CPU in April and Microsoft Azure launching virtual machines powered by its Cobalt CPU in October. Intel also faced growing competition in the AI computing space, where Nvidia commanded an increasingly larger share of data center and cloud spending thanks to its expensive but powerful GPUs and associated systems. In addition, AMD announced in June its plan to release a new data center GPU every year instead of every two years starting with its Instinct MI325X chip.\n\n6. Intel Launches Gaudi 3 With Focus On \u2018Price Performance\u2019 Advantage Intel marked the launch of its Gaudi 3 accelerator chip in September, saying that it delivers a \u201cprice performance advantage\u201d against Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPU. At launch, the company said Gaudi 3 was set to debut in servers from Dell Technologies and Supermicro in October. General availability was expected later in the fourth quarter, a delay from the third-quarter release window Intel gave in April. Hewlett Packard Enterprise was expected to follow with its own Gaudi 3 system in December. System availability from other OEMs, including Lenovo, was not disclosed. On the cloud front, Gaudi 3 was set to become available through services hosted on IBM Cloud early next year and sooner on Intel Tiber AI Cloud, the chipmaker\u2019s recently rebranded cloud service that is meant to support commercial applications. Intel used a launch event in September to outline its Gaudi 3 strategy, which executives said will not focus on chasing the market for training massive AI models that has created seemingly unceasing demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs and led to a new class of expensive, energy-chugging data centers. Instead, the semiconductor giant believes its Gaudi 3 chips will find traction with businesses that need cost-effective AI systems for training and, to a much greater extent, inferencing smaller, task-based models and open-source models. \u201cWe feel like where we are with the product, the customers that are engaged, the problems we\u2019re solving, that\u2019s our swim lane. The bet is that the market will open up in that space, and there\u2019ll be a bunch of people building their own inferencing solutions,\u201d said Justin Hotard, general manager of Intel\u2019s Data Center and AI Group.\n\n5. Intel Heralds New Server CPU Era With Xeon 6 Intel heralded a new era of server CPUs with this year\u2019s launch of the Xeon 6 processors, which represented a major change not only for the brand but also for how it competes in the data center, edge and cloud infrastructure markets amid increasing competition. Announced at the Intel Vision event in April, the semiconductor giant revealed an updated brand for Xeon that took effect with the sixth generation. Rather than calling the product family 6th-Gen Intel Xeon, it\u2019s called Intel Xeon 6, ditching the generation nomenclature and moving the generation number to the end of the name. With Xeon 6, Intel would offer, for the first time in its sever CPU lineup, two microarchitecture options. Rather than relying on a single core type for all CPUs in the lineup, the product family consists of processors containing one of two core types: a performance core (P-core) or an efficient core (E-core). Whereas the Xeon 6 chips with P-cores are optimized to deliver performance for compute-intensive and AI workloads, the ones with E-cores are optimized to deliver efficiency for high-density and scale-out workloads. Both can handle general-purpose work. The decision to bifurcate Xeon CPUs between two core types is about \u201cdelivering flexibility to meet any organization\u2019s diverse efficiency and performance requirements,\u201d according to the company. Intel introduced the idea of P-cores and E-cores in 2021 with the launch of the 12th-Gen Core client processors, many of which include both core types. The Xeon 6 processors with E-cores launched in June with the Xeon 6700E series. Formerly code-named Sierra Forest, the processors take advantage of the E-cores to \u201cdeliver exceptional efficiency\u201d and bring core counts to new highs. The Xeon 6 processors with P-cores launched with the Xeon 6900P series in September. Formerly code-named Granite Rapids, these CPUs will serve as the direct successor to the 5th-Gen Xeon processors that launched last year\n\n4. Intel Fights Back In AI PC Arena With Core Ultra 200 Chips Intel used the second half of the year to launch its Core Ultra 200 series processors for laptops and desktop PCs as part of an expanded AI PC strategy. In September, the company launched the Core Ultra 200V processors for laptops, saying that they would deliver \u201cexceptional performance, breakthrough x86 power efficiency, a massive leap in graphics performance, no-compromise application compatibility, enhanced security and unmatched AI compute.\u201d Intel said the chips would power more than 80 consumer designs from more than 20 of the world\u2019s top PC vendors, including Dell, HP Inc., Lenovo and Samsung. Then in October, the company launched the Core Ultra 200S processors for desktops, saying that they provide \u201cexcellent performance in AI and content creation\u201d as well as an \u201cimmersive gaming experience\u201d and \u201clandmark power reductions across everyday applications, gaming and creation applications.\u201d\n\n3. Intel Shakes Up Channel Leadership Multiple Times In One Year Intel\u2019s Sales and Marketing Group saw big changes in channel leadership multiple times this year, most notably the global channel chief role. The first big change happened in January when the company announced that it had appointed Trevor Vickers to succeed John Kalvin as general manager of Intel\u2019s Global Partners and Support organization. Kalvin, who was Intel\u2019s global channel chief for a little more than three years, was given the newly created position of general manager of the new Go To Market Operations Group in Intel\u2019s Sales and Marketing Group. Then in February, Intel said it had promoted longtime U.S. channel chief Jason Kimrey to the expanded role of vice president of Intel\u2019s newly created North America commercial and partner sales organization. Kimrey\u2019s new group combined the U.S. channel scale and partners team he previously led with teams managing relationships with large U.S. enterprise customers, U.S. communications service providers as well as Canadian customers and partners. Michael Green, a 25-year company veteran, succeeded Kimrey the same month as general manager of U.S. partner sales and programs. After Intel told SMG employees in August it would cut the group\u2019s costs by more than 35 percent as part of the company\u2019s broader push to slash more than 15,000 jobs and over $10 billion in costs in response to worsening financial conditions, the company\u2019s channel leadership experienced another wave of changes. On Sept. 13, SMG employees were informed that Kimrey was leaving Intel, CRN reported. Later that month, Kimrey said he had accepted an \u201cearly retirement opportunity\u201d and added that the decision was \u201cnot based on a lack of faith\u201d in the company or its strategy. Then on Oct. 9, CRN exclusively reported that Intel had appointed three-year channel official Dave Guzzi (pictured) as its new global channel chief. Guzzi took over from Vickers as vice president of global partners. Greg Ernst, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel\u2019s Americas sales organization and global accounts, told CRN at the time that the company\u2019s global partners organization was instituting a new regional engagement model where each major region covered by Intel, including North America, will have its own channel leader. Later in the month, CRN exclusively reported that U.S. channel chief Green would take on an expanded role as general manager of the new North American partner scale group and lead relationships with distributors, national solution providers, national systems integrators, global systems integrators and retailers based in the U.S.\n\n2. Intel Announces Plan To Cut 15,000 Jobs, $10 Billion In Costs Intel on Aug. 1 said it would cut 15,000 jobs\u2014or 15 percent of its workforce\u2014as part of a plan that\u2019s aimed at reducing costs by over $10 billion. The company revealed the plan along with the release of its second-quarter earnings report and said it would make large cuts in operating and capital expenses in addition to suspending its dividend starting in the fourth quarter. \u201cThis is painful news for me to share,\u201d wrote Gelsinger in an open letter to Intel employees posted on the company website. \u201cI know it will be even more difficult for you to read. This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company\u2019s history.\u201d Intel said its second-quarter revenue was $12.8 billion, down 1 percent year over year. It also reported a GAAP net loss of $1.61 billion, or 38 cents per share, a significant change from the prior year\u2019s net income of $1.47 billion, or 25 cents per share. On a non-GAAP basis, Intel reported net income of $83 million, or 2 cents per share, down from the previous year\u2019s net income of $547 million, or 13 cents per share. A few days later, on Aug. 5, Christoph Schell, Intel\u2019s chief commercial officer, told employees of the Sales and Marketing Group that the division would slash costs by more than 35 percent by the end of the year to aid with the broader cost-cutting effort, CRN exclusively reported. The reduced SMG costs were expected to come from a mix of reduced head count and the simplification of programs. In a September update, Gelsinger said that Intel planned to lay off thousands of employees after the company reduced more than half of the 15,000 jobs it targeted for elimination through early retirement packages and voluntary buyouts. Intel began layoffs in October, impacting 1,300 employees in Oregon, 385 employees in Arizona, 319 employees in California and 251 employees in Texas.",

Now the company has introduced a higher-performance model with an Intel Core i3-N305 octa-core chip with support for higher CPU frequencies and speedier graphics. The new model is compatible with carrier boards designed for the original though, which makes the new LattePanda Mu N305 a drop-in replacement for the Mu N100.\n\nAt this point, there are now three LattePanda Mu Compute Modules available with different memory, storage, and pricing:\n\nMu N100 (8GB) Mu N100 (16GB) Mu N305 Processor Intel N100\n\n4 cores, 4 threads\n\nUp to 3.5 GHz\n\n6W TDP Intel Core i3-N305\n\n8 cores, 8 threads\n\nUp to 3.8 GHz\n\n15W TDP Graphics Intel UHD\n\n24 Execution Units\n\nUp to 750 MHz Intel UHD\n\n32 execution units\n\nUp to 1.25 GHz RAM 8GB\n\nLPDDR5-4800\n\nIn-band ECC 16GB\n\nLPDDR5-4800\n\nIn-band ECC Storage 64GB\n\nEMMC 5.1 OS Windows 10 / 11\n\nUbuntu 22.04 / 24.04 Expansion Up to 9 s PCIe 3.0 Lanes\n\nUp to 4 x USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps)\n\nExpandable to 64 x GPIO\n\nUp to 2 x SATA 3.0 6 Gbps drives\n\n8 x USB 2.0\n\n4 x UART\n\n4 x I2C Display 1 x eDP 1.4\n\n3 x HDMI 2.0 / DisplayPort 1.4\n\nUp to 3 displays simultaneously Price $139 $169 $259\n\nNote that those prices are just for the module, which isn\u2019t much use without a carrier board to plug it into. But you can pay more for a complete kit that includes a carrier board, power supply, fan or heat sink, and other optional add-ons like a 7 inch or 11.6 inch display.\n\nGiven how cheap a basic mini PC with an Intel N100 processor is these days, most folks looking for an inexpensive computer would probably be better served by going that route instead. But the LattePanda Mu offers a versatile solution for folks that might want to swap out processor modules, design their own carrier boards, or use a compute module as the brains of a server, router, cluster board, handheld, robot, or some other yet-to-be-designed device.\n\nvia CNX Software\n\nSupport Liliputing Liliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links (if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on Amazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).

At Intel, Bai spent six years in a key role running logic technology development \u2014 a period when the chipmaker suffered a series of technological setbacks.\n\nIn 2021, Intel reassigned Bai to oversee its global supply chain and he left the company the following year. Bai, 62, had been CEO of another Chinese chip manufacturer, Rong Semiconductor, since 2022.\n\nTies between U.S. semiconductor companies and Chinese technology businesses have become a source of growing concern to American politicians, and the U.S. government has imposed a number of restrictions governing the sale of semiconductor technology to China.\n\nChina is investing billions of dollars in its own chip industry, hoping to make it less reliant on technology and equipment from the U.S. and Europe.\n\n-- Mike Rogoway covers Oregon technology and the state economy.

            "content": "6) Liquid cooling takes off\n\nThe heat generated by AI systems has already driven the need for liquid cooling because air cooling is simply not enough. But it\u2019s not just GPUs that run hot \u2013 new CPUs from Intel and AMD are pretty toasty as well. I expect to see an increase in self-contained liquid cooling that will go into existing data centers and not require a hefty retrofit. I also think that HPE and Dell will finally do their own liquid cooling, similar to Lenovo\u2019s Project Neptune. Up until now, HPE and Dell have been content to leave liquid cooling to third parties, but they may have to finally do their own thing.\n\n7) Intel splits\n\nThere\u2019s just no way around it. Intel must spin off its fabrication business just like AMD did in 2008. It was expensive, painful and necessary for long-term success. Gelsinger simply didn\u2019t have the bandwidth to manage Intel foundries and Intel products, and all three suffered for it: The fab business was slow to get started, the chip business fell behind AMD, and Gelsinger\u2019s tenure was cut short. It\u2019s time to cut the fabs loose, Intel.\n\n8) Continued predictions of on-prem exodus\n\nThis completely inaccurate prognostication will continue, and it will continue to be wrong. There are too many reasons to keep an on-premises data center, starting with data privacy and integrity. Repatriation of data from the cloud to on-premises infrastructure goes on every year. On-premises data centers will die when mainframes do.\n\n9) GPU utilization becomes paramount\n\nNvidia is showing no signs of cutting power draw, so it\u2019s up to others to make these things work as efficiently as possible. That means maximum utilization and scaling of hardware. As a result, maximizing GPU utilization will become the primary design goal for modern data centers. This will drive innovations in hardware and software to sustain the infrastructure necessary for training and minimize latency, lagging, and other issues that cause pauses in training. Success will be measured by how effectively data centers can keep their GPU resources utilized.\n\n10) Power constraints impact data center locations\n\nWith almost 500 data centers in the Virginia area, it\u2019s safe to say that region is reaching its limit. The same applies for Texas and Santa Clara. The demand for large-scale processing of data for AI, data analytics, and quantum computing will shift where new data centers are built. The good news is that these applications, especially AI training, are not latency sensitive, so they can afford to be placed in a remote location that has a lot of land and a lot of cheap power. This will largely involve data centers dedicated to massive computational processes, so there\u2019s no need to worry that your colocation provider will open up shop in the Sierra Mountains.",

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Intel\n\nWhat Is Intel's Debt?\n\nThe chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Intel had US$50.2b in debt in September 2024; about the same as the year before. However, it does have US$24.1b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$26.2b.\n\nNasdaqGS:INTC Debt to Equity History January 2nd 2025\n\nA Look At Intel's Liabilities\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Intel had liabilities of US$35.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$53.5b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$24.1b as well as receivables valued at US$5.21b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$59.4b.\n\nThis is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$86.5b. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Intel can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nIn the last year Intel wasn't profitable at an EBIT level, but managed to grow its revenue by 2.6%, to US$54b. We usually like to see faster growth from unprofitable companies, but each to their own.",

The next round of Intel\u2019s \u201cCore Ultra 200\u201d desktop CPUs will be unveiled at CES 2025.\n\nThey will include \u201cnon-K\u201d and \u201cF\u201d variants. According to information leaks, Intel will introduce four non-K SKUs in the coming weeks. These include the Core Ultra 9 285, Ultra 7 265, Ultra 5 245, and Ultra 5 225.\n\nInitial images of these models have appeared in China. They show them inside \u201ctray packaging\u201d used for shipping to system integrators. The Core Ultra 9 285 is reported to have a 24-core configuration.\n\nIt will have 8 Performance Cores and 16 Efficiency Cores. It will have a maximum TDP of 65W and boost clocks reaching up to 5.6 GHz. The Core Ultra 7 265 is set to feature a 20-core configuration with 8P and 12E cores.\n\nIt will have 5.3 GHz boost clocks and 65W TDP. For mid-range options, the Core Ultra 5 245 is expected to have a 14-core configuration. It will have 6P and 8E cores, with max clocks at 5.1 GHz and a 65W TDP.\n\nThe Core Ultra 5 225 variant will offer a 10-core configuration with 6P and 4E cores. It will have max clocks at 4.9 GHz and 64W TDP. In addition to the \u201cnon-K\u201d SKUs, several \u201cF\u201d variants have also surfaced in China\u2019s retail channels.\n\nThese include the Core Ultra 5 230F and Core Ultra 7 265F. The former is reportedly exclusive to Chinese markets. We now have a clearer picture of the ARL-S lineup.\n\nOfficial details and additional variants are expected to be confirmed at CES 2025. The official launch is slated for January 13, 2025. The first images of Intel\u2019s upcoming budget Arrow Lake CPUs have leaked.\n\nThey reveal that they come with an integrated heat spreader (IHS) that is smaller than what is used for other Core Ultra 200 Series chips. The images appeared on Taobao, a Chinese e-commerce site. A merchant has listed the Core Ultra 5 245 and Core Ultra 5 225 for sale ahead of Intel\u2019s official launch.\n\nThis merchant also offers the Core Ultra 7 265 and Core Ultra 9 285.\n\nIntel\u2019s upcoming non-K and F variants\n\nThe smaller IHS on the 245 and 225 is notable.\n\nThe elevated portion that contacts the CPU cooler is slightly reduced, particularly at the top of the chip. This adjustment could potentially affect how these CPUs fit into LGA 1851 motherboards, which were designed for the original IHS. Although the 245 and 225 are compatible with the LGA 1851 socket, the differences might affect their overall fit.\n\nThe codes printed on the smaller IHS of the 245 and 225 start with a \u201cV.\u201d This indicates they are manufactured in Vietnam. The original larger IHS models, including the unreleased 285 and 265, have codes starting with \u201cL.\u201d This signifies production in Ireland. These codes reveal details about the manufacturing process and the origin of the CPUs.\n\nScreenshots from CPU-Z listings on Taobao suggest that the 245 and 225 share the same family, model, and stepping identification as the 285. This hints that the core architecture and functionalities are consistent across these models, despite the differences in the IHS. Intel has not officially commented on the reason behind the smaller IHS for certain models.\n\nThe company often uses a mix of larger and smaller dies for its different series, which might explain the variation. The smaller IHS could imply that Intel has opted for a smaller heat spreader for models with a smaller die. The official launch of these CPUs is expected soon, possibly during Intel\u2019s presentation at the upcoming conference next week.\n\nIntel\u2019s \u201centry-level\u201d Core Ultra 3 205 SKU has been spotted in a leaked \u201cArrow Lake-S\u201d spec sheet. This confirms the presence of the CPU. Intel\u2019s Arrow Lake desktop CPUs had previously hit the markets with the debut of Core Ultra 5, Core Ultra 7, and Core Ultra 9 models.\n\nThe absence of a Core Ultra 3 SKU had been noted, though rumors suggested its presence. The leak indicates that the Core Ultra 3 205 SKU is in the works. It will likely replace the \u201cCore i3\u201d generation from previous CPU lines developed by Intel.\n\nThe Core Ultra 3 205 seems poised to launch without variations such as K, KF, or F models. This suggests a single configuration for this SKU. The Core Ultra 3 205 aims to cater to low-powered or budget-friendly devices.\n\nWhile specific details about the processor\u2019s core distribution remain uncertain, it is speculated to contain four P-Cores and four E-Cores. The base clock speed is anticipated to be 3.9 GHz, with a potential boost up to 4.8 GHz for P-Cores. Details about the onboard iGPU are currently unknown.\n\nHowever, a generational improvement is expected, given the newer Lion Cove P-Cores and Skymont E-Cores architectures. This generational upgrade is likely to position the Core Ultra 3 205 as a competitive option against previous-gen CPUs such as the Core i3 14100/F. The release date has not been officially announced.\n\nHowever, the SKU may debut around Q1 2025, potentially during CES 2025.",

            "content": "Betty Resnick Economist\n\nPassed and signed into law in the early hours of Dec. 21, 2024 \u2013 the day a government shutdown would have begun if Congress had not acted \u2013 the American Relief Act of 2025 includes $31 billion in natural and economic disaster aid for farmers and ranchers, a second extension of the 2018 farm bill and $2.5 billion in additional aid to be distributed through USDA. This Market Intel breaks down what these provisions mean for agriculture. Farm Bill Extension The 2018 farm bill expired \u2013 for a second time \u2013 on Sept. 30, 2024. While the farm bill has been expired for nearly three months, the impacts of an expiration unfold slowly and unevenly across programs it supports. If an extension had not been passed, markets would have gone over the \u201cDairy Cliff\u201d on Jan. 1, 2025, with USDA required to purchase dairy products at about twice current market prices, based on parity price formulas established in the 1930s using 1910-1914 commodity prices. Similarly high prices would have been offered for many crops in the 2025 crop year under so-called permanent law, which is suspended with every farm bill \u2013 and every farm bill extension. While the farm bill extension gives Congress until Sept. 30, 2025, to pass a new farm bill, it did not fund numerous programs without baseline funding \u2013 so-called \u201corphan programs.\u201d The first extension of the 2018 farm bill included $177 million for 19 of its 21 orphan programs for the 2024 fiscal year. The current extension includes no such funding. Unfunded programs range from the Feral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program to Emergency Citrus Disease Research.\n\nDisaster Aid The second pillar of agriculture-related provisions in the American Relief Act of 2025 is $21 billion in disaster aid. Dozens of natural disasters occurred in 2023 and 2024 with over $1 billion in economic impact. For agriculture, significant events across these years include extreme drought in the Gulf Coast; hurricanes Hilary, Idalia, Helene and Milton; and flooding in the Northeast and California. Before estimates for hurricanes Helene- and Milton-related losses were included, Farm Bureau estimated that uncovered disaster-related agricultural losses had already exceeded $14.1 billion across 2023 and 2024 alone. Most of the $21 billion in agriculture disaster aid in the American Relief Act of 2025 is to be distributed by USDA to cover necessary expenses related to the losses of revenue, quality or production for crops (including milk, on-farm stored commodities, crops prevented from planting, and harvested adulterated wine grapes), trees, bushes and vines. Qualifying losses include those caused by the following natural disasters occurring in calendar years 2023 and 2024: droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, floods, derechos, excessive heat, tornadoes, winter storms, freeze (including a polar vortex), smoke exposure and excessive moisture. Of the $21 billion, up to $2 billion will be used to cover livestock losses related to drought, wildfires and floods and $3 million is mandated to be used to carry out regular testing for molasses imports at port of entry. USDA may provide the disaster assistance through block grants to eligible states and territories, including assistance in the form of compensation to producers for timber (including non-federal forest landowners), citrus, pecan and poultry (including infrastructure), and agricultural producers who have suffered losses due to the failure of Mexico to deliver water to the United States in accordance with the 1944 Water Treaty. Producers who have insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Program or coverage under the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) for the applicable crop year are eligible to receive payments covering up to 90% of their disaster-related revenue losses, as determined by USDA. For producers without crop insurance or NAP coverage, payments are available but are capped at 70% of their disaster-related revenue losses as determined by USDA. If uninsured losses are determined to represent only a de minimis (insignificant) portion of a producer's overall revenue losses, USDA may allow payments covering up to 90% of total losses. However, USDA has significant discretion in defining terms like \"de minimis\" and setting program provisions, which will ultimately determine the amount of assistance farmers receive. Other provisions, such as county-level drought triggers, administrative cost caps, expanded reporting obligations and payment rules for specialty categories, will follow the framework established in the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2022 to ensure consistency and clarity in program implementation. USDA is required to provide $220 million through block grants to eligible states with smaller agricultural footprints to provide compensation for crop, timber and livestock losses, including on-farm infrastructure, for 2023 or 2024 weather events the state deems warrant relief. States eligible for this specific block grant must have a 2023 net farm income of less than $250 million, fewer than 8,000 farms, and an average farm size of less than 1,000 acres. Eight states meet all three criteria: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. Economic Aid Of the bill\u2019s $31 billion in direct payments for farmers and ranchers, $10 billion is specifically for economic aid in response to the perilous financial situation in farm country, particularly for row crop farmers. According to bill text, the $10 billion must be distributed within 90 days of enactment through a one-time economic assistance payment for producers of eligible commodities in the 2024 crop year. Eligible commodities include all those covered by Title I of the farm bill, excluding temperate rice japonica. Payments per acre for each crop will be determined as the higher of the two formulas featured in the following graphic. The primary payment will be calculated by multiplying projected per-acre losses by a factor of 26%. For corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, sorghum, oats and barley, the payments are to be calculated using the USDA-Economic Research Service\u2019s published national average cost-of-production forecasts. For all other crops, USDA is to calculate a comparable total estimated cost-of-production. The projected revenue per acre will be calculated using projected 2024/25 market year average prices set in the Dec. 10 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) and a 10-year average of the national average harvested yield per acre. A minimum per-acre payment will be calculated by multiplying 8% of a crop\u2019s statutory reference price by the national average payment yield. The payment yield is the yield used in calculating Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program payments. The farmer will then be paid on all acres planted to eligible commodities for harvest, grazing, haying, silage or other similar purposes for the 2024 crop year. Additionally, farmers will be paid on 50% of all acreage that was prevented from planting during the 2024 crop year due to drought, flooding, other natural disaster or other conditions beyond the control of the farmer as determined by the secretary of agriculture.\n\nBelow are estimated per-acre payment rates. Please note that these are only estimates, and there are still details to be determined by USDA. In addition to potential limitations in funding due to the $10 billion cap, there is uncertainty about how exactly payments for certain crops will be calculated. For instance, will the revenue for cotton and yields be determined based on seed cotton (pre-ginned cotton that is technically the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC)/PLC program crop? Or only account for cotton lint? Additionally, while the bill specifies that rice is defined as including long- and medium-grain rice, the ERS cost-of-production estimate for rice fails to distinguish between types of rice and includes high-value temperate rice japonica. Will the per-acre payments for rice be calculated using the same cost-of-production for all rice, or have different estimates for short-/medium-grain and long-grain rice as is done in the ARC/PLC programs? See the appendix for breakout tables of how the per-acre payments in this Market Intel were calculated. Economic aid will be capped at $125,000 for farmers and ranchers with less than 75% of their average gross income across tax years 2021, 2022 and 2023 derived from farming, ranching or forestry. The cap is increased to $250,000 for farmers with 75% or more of their average gross income derived from farming, ranching and forestry. There is no traditional adjusted gross income maximum to receive aid, and economic aid payment limitations are unrelated to any other program\u2019s payment limits. As is typical with ARC/PLC payments and other forms of agricultural direct payments, the legal structure of the farm will determine the per-farm aid limit. If multiple farmers are part of a general partnership or joint venture, payment limitations are not imposed on the entity level but apply to each farmer individually.\n\nAdditional Miscellaneous Agriculture-Related Funding A hodgepodge of other disaster funding to be administered by USDA totals $2.5 billion, including several funding items closely aligned to a November White House request for emergency funding for USDA. Additional USDA funding includes: $7.5 million for the Office of the Inspector General for oversight of projects and activities carried out by funds given to USDA in the continuing resolution;\n\n$42.5 million for Agricultural Research Service\u2019s building and facilities;\n\n$356.535 million for Farm Service Agency\u2019s Emergency Forest Restoration Program;\n\n$828 million for the Farm Service Agency\u2019s Emergency Conservation Program;\n\n$920 million for the Natural Resources Conservation Service\u2019s Emergency Watershed Protection Program;\n\n$362.5 million for the Rural Development Program\u2019s Rural Development Disaster Assistance Fund; and\n\n$25 million for the Food and Nutrition Service\u2019s Commodity Assistance Program to support The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) for infrastructure needs related to the consequences of major disaster declarations from 2023 and 2024. Conclusion The American Relief Act of 2025 will provide much-needed relief to farmers and ranchers across the country. A total of $31 billion of economic and disaster aid for farmers and an extension of the 2018 farm bill has certainly saved farms. However, an updated farm bill with a functioning safety net would have made much of this ad hoc aid unnecessary. The suspension of funding for the orphan programs also leaves a hole for some important priorities for agriculture. A new farm bill in 2025 could plug these holes and prevent the need for ad hoc economic aid in future years. Appendix",

            "content": "A little more good news came out for chip stock Intel (INTC), which it sorely needs much more of as it looks to take on the new year in an increasingly challenging environment. And it got those from a new connection with LG, who turned to Intel to augment its Gram and Gram Pro laptops. The news was good enough for investors, who sent shares up fractionally in Thursday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nThe current line of Gram laptops was solid enough, noted a report from The Verge, but Intel stepped in to offer up some processing power to give it some new artificial intelligence (AI) functionality. As a result, the 16 inch Gram Pro will now boast Lunar Lake Core Ultra V-Series processors, giving it access to Copilot Plus. The 17 inch Gram Pro and the 16 inch two-in-one, meanwhile, will instead put Arrow Lake processors to work.\n\nAnd with all this new processing power, users get access to key features like \u201cGram Chat On-Device,\u201d which turns to a \u201c\u2026small language model derived from LG AI Research\u2019s EXAONE large language model.\u201d That gives it somewhat limited functionality, but also does not require online connectivity. Users get access to the \u201cTime Travel\u201d feature, which allows quick access to content recently accessed. This includes websites, documents, and even videos.\n\nThe Near Term for Intel\n\nBut there may be good news elsewhere here, as Network World offered up a list of predictions for 2025. Topping the list was new president Trump \u201cback(ing) off on tech tariffs,\u201d and also ponying up the cash that Biden promised under the CHIPS Act. Given Trump\u2019s connection to American manufacture, and vice president Vance\u2019s hometown boy status in Ohio, it is a safe bet that Ohio will not go without government handouts on this one.\n\nHowever, there is a challenge: the rising tide of AMD (AMD). 2024 did not deliver any major wins for graphics cards, noted XDA Developers. But with the rise of the Battlemage, 2025 looks like it may be a different story. But \u201cprice conscious gamers\u201d will have a tough time in 2025 trying to choose from a wealth of options between AMD and Intel. And with CPUs also involved in the hunt, AMD and Intel will have a whole new battle to hash out, while gamers have perhaps their best year in a while.\n\nIs Intel a Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock based on one Buy, 21 Holds and five Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 56.58% loss in its share price over the past year, the average INTC price target of $24.53 per share implies 21.56% upside potential.\n\nSee more INTC analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

On the other hand, anybody who wants and has resources is welcome to package and maintain the legacy packages and llvm 15 in the repositories.\"\n\n...\n\n\"This is planned obsolescence at its best. Intel-controlled software dropping support for older (Intel) hardware to force you to buy new one to replace it.\n\n\n\nWe have come to expect that from proprietary software, including the proprietary NVidia driver, but for Free Software, this is a new low. Introducing a compatibility package is the least we can do. Ideally, the project should be forked upstream to restore support for older hardware.\"\n\nWith the Intel Graphics Compiler having dropped Ice Lake and older support and in turn the Intel Compute Runtime dropping Ice Lake and older to just focus on newer Intel graphics hardware support, Fedora packagers and other stakeholders have been grappling with how to handle the situation. For Fedora 42 there's been a proposal for updating to the newer Intel Compute Runtime code for benefiting the more recent Intel graphics hardware while in recent days there's been talk of forking the legacy code.Raised on the Fedora development list in recent days is the possibility of forking the Intel Compute Runtime and related code for being able to continue offering legacy packages on at least Fedora Linux with this Ice Lake and prior support. Messages were expressed such as:More commentary via the Fedora devel thread But so far no firm commitment from any stakeholders willing to step up and maintain legacy packages for the Intel graphics compute stack for Ice Lake and prior.Maintaining a legacy version of the Intel Compute Runtime stack will become more challenging with time. The Intel Compute Runtime isn't just some simple, standalone package but requires its own older version of LLVM for the Intel Graphics Compiler and other intricacies that will make packaging and ongoing maintenance more difficult. Plus with Intel themselves no longer maintaining any legacy branch of the hardware support, fixing any bugs will likely be very limited and up to those independently volunteering to maintain such legacy packages.Without many volunteers stepping up to maintain such a legacy Compute Runtime stack and likely a need for a multi-distribution effort to find enough community open-source developers volunteering to do so, the support will likely crumble with time. Plus let's face it there isn't too many OpenCL or Level Zero workloads that are really beneficial on aging Ice Lake or older Intel integrated graphics... It would be more pressing and popular if it affected discrete or more powerful graphics and where there are widely-used applications relying on the OpenCL / Level Zero acceleration.\n\nSo for now there's talk of offering legacy Intel graphics compute support on future Fedora releases but no firm action plan nor the volunteers/resources to really see it through. We'll see what happens moving forward starting with the Fedora 42 release in the spring where they plan to upgrade the Intel Compute Runtime for the newer Intel hardware support.As an alternative there is also the Mesa Rusticl driver that is generic and becoming in increasingly great shape. Rusticl can work on the Intel driver stack to provide Rust-based OpenCL although no Level Zero support.",

            "content": "2025 will be a pivotal year for chip-giant Intel (INTC 1.10%) as it navigates an industry that it no longer dominates. A multiyear turnaround effort led by former CEO Pat Gelsinger, which aimed to turn Intel into a world-class foundry, has yet to pay off as the company struggles on multiple fronts.\n\nIn the PC market, a combination of sluggish demand, stiff competition from AMD, and Qualcomm launching its Arm-based laptop CPUs have left Intel fighting for market share. In the data center market, years of lackluster products, AMD's incredible comeback, and a shift in spending toward artificial intelligence (AI) chips have left Intel reeling. And in manufacturing, foundry customer wins have been few and far between as Intel drives toward completing its initial process technology roadmap.\n\nIntel enters 2025 without a permanent CEO and with a strategy that's somewhat up in the air. This year will be crucial for the company.\n\nIntel 18A needs to work\n\nThe final process node on Intel's initial foundry roadmap is Intel 18A. The company expects this process to be the best in the industry when it launches, and it's packed with features, including a new transistor design and backside power delivery. The company has filled out its post-18A roadmap, but the whole foundry strategy hinges on the success of Intel 18A.\n\nIntel 18A is expected to be ready for production in early 2025, although it will take time for volumes to ramp up. The company has snagged a few big-name customers for Intel 18A, including Microsoft and Amazon, but it's unclear when those deals will begin to produce meaningful external foundry revenue. At the moment, essentially all of Intel's foundry revenue is internal, coming from the company's various product segments.\n\nIntel plans to reach $15 billion in annual external foundry revenue by 2030. That ambitious target requires Intel 18A to deliver on its promises and launch on time. Any delays or missteps could be catastrophic for the company, not only because they would derail the foundry business, but also because Intel's next-generation products depend on Intel 18A.\n\nLeaping ahead in PC and server CPUs\n\nNotwithstanding some fumbles with its latest Arrow Lake PC CPUs, Intel is in a reasonably strong competitive position in the PC CPU industry. The company has also gained ground in the server CPU industry with its Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids CPU families, although customers remain focused on AI chips, an area where Intel has fallen short.\n\nIn 2025, Intel has big launches scheduled in both markets. In the PC market, Intel plans to launch Panther Lake in the second half of the year. Panther Lake will bring manufacturing mostly back in-house after both Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake outsourced production to TSMC. The most performance-critical portions of Panther Lake will use the Intel 18A process.\n\nIn the server market, Intel should have Clearwater Forest ready to go next year. Like Sierra Forest, Clearwater Forest is an efficiency-focused processor comprised of large numbers of energy-sipping CPU cores.\n\nThe chips will be well suited for cloud-based workloads and other applications where core density is more important than raw performance. Like Panther Lake, Clearwater Forest will be built on the Intel 18A process.\n\nIf Intel 18A is delayed or runs into issues, Intel's product roadmap will be in trouble.\n\nFinding a new CEO\n\nThe surprise \"retirement\" of former CEO Pat Gelsinger has left Intel with temporary co-CEOs and a lack of clarity around its strategy. The company needs a new leader sooner rather than later, and an outsider might be necessary to sufficiently shake things up.\n\nChanging the culture of a once-dominant industry leader that's stuck in its ways is a monumentally difficult task. Whoever ends up in the top position is going to face some serious challenges as they try to recapture some of Intel's former glory.\n\nA turnaround stock for 2025\n\nIntel stock has understandably cratered in response to all the uncertainty and upheaval plaguing the company. However, the company's position as the only U.S.-based advanced logic semiconductor manufacturer puts it in a unique position. The stock currently trades well below book value, an indication that the market is extremely pessimistic.\n\nWhile Intel is undoubtedly struggling, the company has a solid product roadmap and a foundry business that still has long-term potential. With the right leader and the right strategy, Intel stock could end up being a big winner over the next decade.",

While it was not obvious immediately, the potential was enough to rattle cages and get people thinking. Certainly, chip giant Intel (INTC) was in line for some of the fallout from that decision. But how can Intel respond to this? How can Intel preserve its markets in the face of a processor that might be strong enough to knock it out of the picture.\n\nDon't Miss Our New Year's Offers:\n\nDiscover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks\n\nMake smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter\n\nWhat Intel Is Up Against\n\nThe early word about Willow is that it has a very real potential to alter the landscape for everything from finance to healthcare and well beyond. A report from Forbes illustrates the serious firepower that Willow represents: it can solve in just five minutes what the current top notch of supercomputers would take 10 septillion years to complete.\n\nA septillion, for those not familiar, is a one followed by 27 zeroes. That\u2019s a thousand sextillion, and trying to parse the numbers from there can get downright confusing. But the key takeaway is that a Willow is orders of magnitude more powerful than anything currently available.\n\nAnd moreover, Willow does the job with an almost staggering level of accuracy, managing to get better the more it processes. And that makes it intensely better than just about anything out there.\n\nWhat Intel Can Do\n\nThe good news on this front, however, is that practical applications for the Willow are still a long ways off. Quantum computing essentially just arrived, so actually getting it to the point where it could serve as anything more than a curiosity will take quite a while yet.\n\nAnd this is where Intel actually has an opportunity to defuse Google\u2019s lead before it has a potential to swamp the market and shut Intel out for good. One thing it could do immediately is recover from its losses. Intel has not been doing well in the last few months, and it needs to get back on track. While the new co-CEOs in charge of Intel are well on the way to turning things around, the current moves are doing little to address the potential threat that is quantum computing.\n\nHowever, Intel is hardly sleeping on the quantum front. In fact, a CNET report revealed that Intel has had a dog in the hunt for quantum computing since June of 2023. That was when Intel rolled out a 12-qubit chip of its own. Known as Tunnel Falls, it represented an unusual step as Intel assembled its qubits from \u201cindividual electrons.\u201d\n\nBut even back then, Intel was regarded as \u201clagging behind\u201d in terms of quantum computing. Google had apparently been offering quantum computers for \u201cyears,\u201d the report noted, and it was not alone therein. IBM (IBM) also had its own, as did some others. So while Intel does have a presence in this field, it is still somewhat behind. That is not a good position to be in, particularly for a company that needs to be near the forefront to keep market share out of competitors\u2019 hands.\n\nUltimately, when you are talking about a chip that makes even Elon Musk say \u201cWow,\u201d which he did on X, it is clearly a potential game changer. Intel has little hope here but to work on its own quantum development in a bid to potentially fend off Google.\n\nIs Intel a Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock based on one Buy, 21 Holds and five Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 57.49% loss in its share price over the past year, the average INTC price target of $24.53 per share implies 22.34% upside potential.\n\nSee more INTC analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

However, if you're looking for the best cheap CPU, you're in the right place.\n\nIf you're looking to spend at the upper end of the budget spectrum, the Intel Core i5-13400 is simply the processor to beat. At $160, this budget chip offers the most performance of the budget lineup.\n\nOne step down the ladder, the Ryzen 5 5600 proves it has an exceptional blend of price and performance, thus earning it a spot on our list of best budget CPUs. This chip comes with plenty of cores that not only offer leading performance in gaming at its price point, but are also adept enough to chew through more standard types of work.\n\nIntel's new 14th-Gen chips consist of refresh models for the lower-end Core i3 chips, so the Core i3-13100 delivers nearly the same performance as its successor, the Core i3-14100. That means you can save money and get basically the same performance by selecting the 13100 model.\n\nAMD\u2019s Renoir chips take a new approach of using Zen 2-powered APU silicon with disabled integrated graphics units to tackle the low-end.

Intel Core i5-13400 Best $130-$160 Budget CPU Pick Our expert review: Average Amazon review: \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 Specifications Architecture: Raptor Lake Refresh Socket: LGA 1700 Cores/Threads: 10 (6P + 4E) / 16 Base Frequency: 2.5 Top Boost Frequency: 4.6 TDP: 65W/148W Today's Best Deals View at Amazon View at Newegg View at Walmart Reasons to buy + Strong gaming performance + Strong single- and multi-thread + Competitive pricing + Platform pricing due to DDR4 support + PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 memory + Supports memory overclocking + Adequate boxed cooler Reasons to avoid - Requires LGA1700 motherboard - Not fully overclockable - Potential for instability (see note)\n\nThe 10-core 16-thread $160 Core i5-13400F was the go-to value gaming chip for some time, but the newer model took its place on most best CPU lists. For instance, Intel released the newer $175 Core i5-14400F, built on the same silicon. However, it delivers slim to non-existent real-world performance increases over the Core i5-13400F and has a higher price tag. Thus, the slightly older 13400F is still the best Core i5 option if you're on a budget.\n\nThe 13400F is an incredible deal at $160, but it doesn't have in-built graphics, so you'll need a discrete graphics card if you select this chip. The $175 Raptor Lake Core i5-13400 is a solid deal if you need integrated graphics in your processor, but it comes at a premium.\n\n\n\nThe Core i5-13400F has six P-cores that support hyper-threading and operate at a 2.5 GHz base and 4.6 GHz boost clock. The four e-cores for threaded tasks run up to 3.3 GHz. The 13400F supports solid connectivity with support for DDR4-3200 or up to DDR5-4800 memory, along with 16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 and an additional four lanes of PCIe 4.0 from the chip for M.2 SSDs.\n\n\n\nThe Core i5-13400F comes with a capable cooler that can handle its 65W/148W base/peak power rating, and you can use a newer 700- or 800-series motherboard or an older 600-series model if the BIOS supports the chip. Most gamers will enjoy the lower price and comparable performance of DDR4, but you can upgrade to the slightly more expensive DDR5 if you need access to more memory throughput.\n\nIntel's partners offer B- and H-series motherboards, and a B660/B760 motherboard plus a Core i5-13400F CPU makes a solid value gaming combo.\n\nRead More: Intel Core i5-13400F Review\n\nBest $100-$130 Budget CPU Pick\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\n2. Intel Core i5-12400F Best $100-$130 Budget CPU Pick Our expert review: Specifications Architecture: Alder Lake Socket: LGA 1700 Cores/Threads: 6 (6P + 0E) / 12 Base Frequency: 2.5 Top Boost Frequency: 4.4 TDP: 65W / 117W Today's Best Deals View at Amazon Check Walmart Reasons to buy + Strong gaming performance + Support for DDR4 + Support for PCIe 5.0 + Single-threaded performance + Sufficient bundled cooler Reasons to avoid - No integrated graphics - No CPU core overclocking - Limited memory overclocking\n\nAt $110, the graphics-less Core i5-12400F is a solid choice, and you can step up to the $130 Core i5-12400 if you need integrated graphics. This chip is slightly faster than the alternate in this class, the Ryzen 5 5600 listed below, in both gaming and productivity work. The 12400F's connectivity features and more modern platform are the big selling point, though. If you're looking for support for more modern interfaces, like PCIe 5.0, DDR5 and DDR4, this chip makes even more sense -- AMD's Ryzen 5 5600 only supports DDR4 and PCIe 4.0.\n\nThe Core i5-12400F comes with six P-cores and 12 threads, but it lacks e-cores. In contrast, its predecessor and our top pick above, the 13400F, comes with four e-cores to add more performance in threaded workloads. The 12400F has a 2.5 GHz base clock and boosts up to 4.4 GHz. The chip also comes with 18 MB of L3 cache and has a 65W PBP (base) and 117W MTP (peak) power rating.\n\nThe Core i5-12400F drops into the cheap and plentiful Socket 1700 ecosystem, so 600- and 700-series boards are fine. Naturally, a B-series model will be the best logical pairing for this class of chip. These come in either DDR4 or DDR5 flavors, so be sure to match your motherboard to the type of RAM you choose to use.\n\nThe Core i5-12400F also comes with a competent bundled cooler, but we always recommend stepping up to a more capable third-party model, some of which can be found as for as low as $20 if you're particularly price sensitive. All in all, the Core i5-12400F at this price point is a solid chip for a budget system.\n\nRead More: Intel Core i5-12400F Review\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nThe $107 AMD Ryzen 5 5600 delivers a solid blend of performance in both gaming and productivity applications, bringing a new level of value to the Zen 3 lineup. If you're fine sticking with a previous-gen AM4 motherboard, the Ryzen 5 5600 makes a great budget build. The primary trade-off for the AM4 platform is that you're limited to DDR4, and you don't have access to PCIe 5.0, but this isn't a problem for most users at this price point. However, the Core i5-12400F is a better deal if you're looking for DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 support.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 5600 also makes an absolutely unbeatable budget chip if you're updating a first-gen Ryzen system. The 5600 unseats the Ryzen 5 5600X, a long-time favorite. The 5600X is only a mostly imperceptible ~1% faster in gaming and multi-threaded PC work than the non-X model, but provides a 4% advantage in single-threaded work.\n\n\n\nYou can find the six-core 12-thread Ryzen 5 5600 at $107, a deep discount brought on by competitive pressure from Intel. In fact, our testing shows that the Ryzen 5 5600 generally matches the gaming performance of its more expensive sibling, the ~$175 Ryzen 7 5800X. That makes the 5600 an incredibly well-rounded chip that can handle gaming well, from competitive-class performance with high refresh rate monitors to multi-tasking gaming workloads like streaming, while also serving up more than enough performance for day-to-day productivity apps. As with all AMD CPUs for gaming, you can fully overclock the CPU.\n\n\n\nThe Ryzen 5 5600 has a 3.7 GHz base and 4.6 GHz boost clock. The chip also has a 65W TDP rating, so it runs cool and quiet. Existing AMD owners with a 500-series motherboard will be happy, as the 5600X drops right into existing 500-, 400-, and 300-series motherboards. If you need a new motherboard to support the chip, AMD's AM4 motherboards are plentiful and relatively affordable, with the B-series lineup offering the best overall value for this class of chip.\n\nRead: AMD Ryzen 5 5600 Review\n\nBest $60-$100 Entry-Level Budget CPU Pick\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\n3. Intel Core i3-13100F Best $60-$100 Entry-Level Budget CPU Pick Our expert review: Specifications Architecture: Raptor Lake Socket: LGA 1700 Cores/Threads: 4 (4P + 0E) / 8 Base Frequency: 3.4 Top Boost Frequency: 4.5 TDP: 60W / 89W Today's Best Deals View at Amazon View at Walmart View at Newegg Reasons to buy + Strong gaming performance + Support for DDR4 + Support for PCIe 5.0 + Single-threaded performance + Sufficient bundled cooler Reasons to avoid - No integrated graphics - Comparatively slow in threaded applications - No CPU core overclocking - Limited memory overclocking\n\nThe graphics-less $80 Core i3-13100F is a shoo-in for the best budget CPU in its price class. This chip delivers exceptional gaming performance along with good enough performance in productivity applications, given its price point.\n\nThe Core i3-13100 comes with six p-cores and 12 threads that operate at a 3.4 GHz base and 4.5 GHz boost clock rate, but it doesn't come with e-cores for background tasks as the Core i5 models do. It also comes with 12 MB of L3 cache. The 13100 has a 60W / 89W processor base/max turbo power, 16 PCIe 5.0 lanes and four PCIe 4.0 lanes, and support up to DDR4-3200 and DDR5-4800 MT/s (caveats apply to DDR5 support). Intel's non-K models don't allow overclocking of the CPU cores, but they do support memory overclocking.\n\n\n\nThe Core i3-13100F also comes with Intel's new improved cooler, saving you some cash. Like the non-F model, the Core i3-13100F comes with a 60W PBP (base) and 89W MTP (peak) power rating, so it's easy to cool with the included cooler.\n\n\n\nIntel's Raptor Lake drops into Socket 1700 motherboards from the 600-series or 700-series, including the Z-, H- and, B-series boards. The Core i3-12100 is a locked chip, meaning it isn't overclockable. However, Intel supports memory overclocking on Z-, B-, and H-series motherboards (Z-Series doesn't make sense for this class of chip, though).\n\n\n\nRead: Intel Core i3-13100F Review\n\nBest Budget Gaming APU CPU Pick\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\n4. AMD Ryzen 5 5600G Best Budget Gaming APU CPU Pick Our expert review: Average Amazon review: \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 Specifications Architecture: Zen 3 Socket: AM4 Cores/Threads: 6/12 Base Frequency: 3.9GHz Top Boost Frequency: 4.4GHz TDP: 65W Today's Best Deals View at Walmart View at Newegg View at Amazon Reasons to buy + Stellar price-to-performance ratio + Faster Zen 3 CPU cores + Passable 1080p, solid 720p + Excellent power consumption and efficiency + Great overclocking headroom + Bundled cooler + Compatible with some AM4 motherboards Reasons to avoid - PCIe 3.0 connectivity\n\nThe Ryzen 5 5600G steps into the arena as the value champ for APUs, which are chips with strong enough integrated graphics that they don't require a discrete GPU for light gaming\u2014just be sure you're willing to accept lowered quality settings.\n\n\n\nAt $120, the Ryzen 5 5600G gives you 96% of the gaming performance on integrated graphics than its more expensive sibling, the $160 Ryzen 7 5700G, but for 25% less cash. Our testing shows that its level of performance makes it the best value APU on the market. As long as you're willing to sacrifice fidelity and resolution and keep your expectations in check, the Ryzen 5 5600G's Vega graphics have surprisingly good performance in gaming.\n\nThe 5600G's Vega graphics served up comparatively great 1280x720 gaming across numerous titles in our tests, but options become more restricted at 1080p. Of course, you can get away with 1080p gaming, but you'll need to severely limit the fidelity settings with most titles.\n\n\n\nWith eight cores and 16 threads that operate at a 3.9 GHz base and boost up to 4.4 GHz, the Ryzen 5 5600G also offers solid performance for its price point in standard desktop PC applications. The chip also comes with a bundled Wraith Stealth cooler, sweetening the value prop, and drops into existing 500-series and some 400-series motherboards, though support on the latter will vary by vendor.\n\n\n\nRead: AMD Ryzen 5 5600G Review",

            "content": "Happy 2025 STH\u2019ers! I just wanted to put this into a post, since it is something we may reference later. I just wanted to quickly mark the new year with what our starting point is for those buying servers. Since it is 2025, I figure this would be a good post to memorialize where we are at with the technology stack.\n\nCPU Cores Per Socket\n\nAMD is currently at 192 Turin Dense cores and 384 threads per socket, and 128 full cache and clock speed cores (256 threads) in Turn. Intel has its 128 core/ 256 thread Granite Rapids AP and its Sierra Forest-SP at 144 cores/ threads. The smaller Granite Rapids-SP and larger 288 core Sierra Forest-AP we expect in the second half of Q1 2025, assuming that 288 core part does not become solely a special order hyper-scale part.\n\nOn the Arm side, NVIDIA Grace is still at 72 cores for the single CPU module and 144 cores for the dual chip module. Check out our Quick Introduction to the NVIDIA GH200 aka Grace Hopper piece because the memory bandwidth varies based on the capacity. Ampere Altra Max is 128 cores and is still chugging along while the AmpereOne is at 192 cores.\n\nNetworking Speeds\n\nOn the switching side, we are at 51.2Tbps switch silicon, although the 102.4T generation should start to emerge in the next quarter or two. We already showed the Delta DC-90640 A Next-Gen 2025 102.4T Switch.\n\nFor client networking, we expect to stay at 400GbE for the near future. It will take PCIe Gen6 or multi-host adapters to get to 800Gbps speeds due to the PCIe bandwidth limitations.\n\nSomething that will change is that 25GbE is currently a PCIe Gen5 x1 slot making it harder to deploy given how inefficient it is to use just given PCIe lanes. 100GbE is becoming the new 25GbE, but the AI space is really pushing 400Gbps networking to efficiently use PCIe lanes.\n\nSSDs and HDD Capacities\n\nHard drives are still progressing slowly as we have seen the launch of a few 30TB class models. On the other hand, SSDs are growing in capacity at an immense pace. We discussed in our Solidigm D5-P5336 61.44TB SSD Review how hard drives lost. The 122.88TB generation is upon us with multiple vendors starting to ship. Those might be sold out for 2025.\n\nAround the corner is the 245.76TB generation and that is coming faster than many think.\n\nServer Memory\n\nWhile most memory today is a maximum of DDR5-6400, the capacity has really stalled. We are still seeing a lot more 64GB and 128GB DIMMs being used than one probably would have thought would be the case in 2020. Instead of increasing capacity per DIMM, we are seeing servers offer 12 memory channels. On the speed side, adding, eventually, MCR DIMMs will be a big deal.\n\nPerhaps the bigger trend is that we are seeing a lot more on the CXL memory front. We have been seeing designs utilize CXL Type-3 devices for memory expansion which is great to see.\n\nGPUs for AI\n\nThere are plenty of AI accelerators out there, but the GPUs are the big one. NVIDIA is transitioning from the HGX H100/ H200 platforms for those that are starting to get GB200 platforms. For those who are not huge customers, the Hopper generation is still it.\n\nAMD is transitioning from the Instinct MI300X to the MI325X generation. On the APU side, it seems like that has become part of El Capitan, but we did not hear about a major refresh yet. AMD\u2019s main architecture is an 8-way OAM platform with two AMD EPYC CPUs and direct Infinity Fabric links.\n\nIntel still says Falcon Shores is coming in 2025.\n\nFinal Words\n\nFrom a rack level, a top-end AI rack is in the 120-140kW range which will be quaint by 2027. Hopefully, that covers most of the big system components. In the future, when we look back on the start of 2025, we at least have this memorialized set of where we started the year.",

Hurricane Helene Devastates Rural Southeast\n\nAs the most powerful hurricane ever to strike Florida\u2019s Big Bend region and the deadliest Atlantic storm since Hurricane Maria in 2017, Helene left affected communities not only grieving for lost loved ones but also grappling with the overwhelming challenge of rebuilding their homes, farms, and livelihoods. While it was too early to estimate total agricultural losses, understanding the region's agricultural profile offered a glimpse of what recovery might look like. This article examined long-term challenges rural communities face as they rebuild.\n\n9. Five Things We\u2019ll Miss Without a New Farm Bill\n\nThe 2018 farm bill went into 2024 on a one-year extension. Six years of tumult \u2013 including the highest inflation in 40 years and geopolitical disruptions to markets for the things farmers buy and sell \u2013 left key parts of the 2018 farm bill outdated. As we move into another year of farm bill negotiations in 2025, this Market Intel outlines the short-comings of the now seven-year old farm bill.\n\n8. Three Reasons Why Farmers Need Economic Aid\n\nThe week of Dec. 16 brought intense Congressional debate over what to include in the year-end continuing budget resolution. With emergency economic aid for farmers and ranchers on the chopping block, this Market Intel outlined farmers\u2019 need for help.\n\n7. Beef Prices Soar to Record Highs, Yet Farmers Struggle to Reap the Benefits\n\nJuly 2024 marked the first time in history that the national average price for all fresh beef moved above $8, according to USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service. While the cash price for cattle was (and still is) elevated, increased costs for supplies and market uncertainty, have obscured the profit outlook for cattle farmers and ranchers, stunting growth of the U.S. cattle herd.\n\n6. What Happens When a Farm Bill Dies\n\nThe 2018 farm bill expired on Sept. 30, 2024. Other Market Intel articles explored why the 2018 farm bill is outdated, but this article focused on what occurs when one officially expires. Although it was extended for a year in the end-of-year continuing resolution, many programs were suspended for months upon the September deadline, and farmers and ranchers waited in limbo to see what the last three months of the year would hold for the farm bill.\n\n5. Record High July 4th Cookout Costs: Inflation Hits the Backyard\n\nSimilar to our long-standing Thanksgiving meal survey, volunteers from across the United States contribute to American Farm Bureau\u2019s Fourth of July market basket survey to determine the average cost of summer cookout staples. This year was the most expensive Fourth of July grocery bill in the history of the survey. This Market Intel considered the market pressures driving your grocery bill, as well as how inflation and an outdated farm bill were affecting farmers and ranchers.\n\n4. U.S. Cattle Inventory Smallest in 73 Years\n\nThis Market Intel provided analysis of the Jan. 1 Cattle Inventory Report, which became the only cattle inventory data released in 2024. The overall cattle inventory was historically low, yet the supply of cattle on feed was quite large. This provided opportunities for profitability in the cattle business in 2024, but a smaller calf crop and fewer replacement heifers also led to record beef prices for consumers.\n\n3. Thanksgiving Dinner Costs are Down Again\n\nThe 39th annual American Farm Bureau Federation Thanksgiving dinner survey was released on Nov. 20, 2024. This detailed analysis of what drove costs for Thanksgiving classics looked at agricultural production, rising input costs for farmers and inflation pressures.\n\n2.Over 140,000 Farms Lost in 5 Years\n\nUSDA released the 2022 Census of Agriculture on Feb. 13, 2024. This Market Intel examined declines in farms and agricultural land between the 2017 and 2022 censuses.\n\n1. Port Strike Could Sink Access to Foreign Markets\n\nNegotiations between the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (ILA) and the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) looked to be at a stalemate as we approached the expiration of their contract on Sept. 30, 2024. The ILA is the largest union of maritime workers in North America, representing nearly 85,000 longshoremen across the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, Great Lakes, major U.S. rivers, Puerto Rico, Eastern Canada and the Bahamas. On the employer side, USMX represents approximately 40 ocean carriers and terminal operators where ILA members work. As we approached a looming port strike, this Market Intel explored the possible effects on both farmers and consumers. While a temporary agreement was reached in September, the threat of a strike continues with contract negotiations continuing through January 15, 2025.",

This information is supported by shipping documents found on Platform X, which reveal a clamshell design on the BMG-G21 chip, enabling the use of 12 GDDR6 modules with 16 GB capacity each. This GPU is positioned for professional users, likely under the Pro or Flex series.\n\nEarlier this month, Intel officially introduced the Battlemage lineup for mainstream users, featuring the upcoming Arc B580 and Arc B570. Among these, the Arc B580 has received positive feedback, with demand far exceeding supply. According to rumors, Intel has developed at least three Battlemage chip variants: BMG-G31, BMG-G21, and BMG-G10. The BMG-G21 chip serves as the foundation for the Arc B580, offering a 192-bit memory interface and 20 Xe2 cores.\n\nThe 24 GB Battlemage GPU, expected to launch in 2025, is targeted at the professional market. This suggests the product won\u2019t cater to general consumers but could be the successor to the Flex or Pro lineup based on Alchemist. Its intended audience includes data centers, edge computing, scientific research, and individual developers.\n\nCurrently, the Arc Pro A60\u2014the flagship GPU in the Arc Pro group\u2014only has 12 GB of VRAM. Video memory capacity plays a crucial role in training AI models and processing inferences for large language models. Other Intel competitors have already reached up to 48 GB VRAM, such as AMD\u2019s Radeon W7000 series or Nvidia\u2019s Ada Lovelace workstation series. However, the BMG-G21 is designed to compete with the RTX 4060 rather than high-end models like the RTX 4090 or RTX 6000 Ada. A more realistic comparison would be the RTX 2000 Ada with 16 GB VRAM or the Radeon Pro W7600 with 8 GB VRAM.\n\nIntel is expected to reveal more information next month. However, given the 2025 timeline, it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the exact official launch date for this GPU.

            "content": "In this article INTC\n\nAVGO Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nHock Tan, CEO of Broadcom (L) and former CEO of Intel, Pat Gelsinger. Reuters | CNBC\n\nIt was a big year for silicon in Silicon Valley \u2014 but a brutal one for the company most responsible for the area's moniker. Intel, the 56-year-old chipmaker co-founded by industry pioneers Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce and legendary investor Arthur Rock, had its worst year since going public in 1971, losing 61% of its value. The opposite story unfolded at Broadcom , the chip conglomerate run by CEO Hock Tan and headquartered in Palo Alto, California, about 15 miles from Intel's Santa Clara campus. Broadcom's stock price soared 111% in 2024 as of Monday's close, its best performance ever. The current company is the product of a 2015 acquisition by Avago, which went public in 2009. The driving force behind the diverging narratives was artificial intelligence. Broadcom rode the AI train, while Intel largely missed it. The changing fortunes of the two chipmakers underscores the fleeting nature of leadership in the tech industry and how a few key decisions can result in hundreds of billions \u2014 or even trillions \u2014 of dollars in market cap shifts. Broadcom develops custom chips for Google and other huge cloud companies. It also makes essential networking gear that large server clusters need to tie thousands of AI chips together. Within AI, Broadcom has largely been overshadowed by Nvidia , whose graphics processing units, or GPUs, power most of the large language models being developed at OpenAI, Microsoft , Google and Amazon and also enable the heftiest AI workloads. Despite having a lower profile, Broadcom's accelerator chips, which the company calls XPUs, have become a key piece of the AI ecosystem. \"Why it's really shooting up is because they're talking about AI, AI, AI, AI,\" Eric Ross, chief investment strategist at Cascend, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" earlier this month.\n\nwatch now\n\nIntel, which for decades was the dominant U.S. chipmaker, has been mostly shut out of AI. Its server chips lag far behind Nvidia's, and the company has also lost market share to longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices while spending heavily on new factories. Intel's board ousted Pat Gelsinger from the CEO role on Dec. 1, after a tumultuous four-year tenure. \"I think someone more innovative might have seen the AI wave coming,\" Paul Argenti, professor of management at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, said in an interview on \"Squawk Box\" after the announcement. An Intel spokesperson declined to comment. Broadcom is now worth about $1.1 trillion and is the eighth U.S. tech company to cross the trillion-dollar mark. It's the second most valuable chip company, behind Nvidia, which has driven the AI boom to a $3.4 trillion valuation, trailing only Apple among all public companies. Nvidia's stock price soared 178% this year, but actually did better in 2023, when it gained 239%. Until four years ago, Intel was the world's most valuable chipmaker, nearing a $300 billion market cap in early 2020. The company is now worth about $85 billion, just got booted off the Dow Jones Industrial Average \u2014 replaced by Nvidia \u2014 and has been in talks to sell off core parts of its business. Intel now ranks 15th in market cap among semiconductor companies globally.\n\n'Not meant for everybody'\n\nFollowing the Avago-Broadcom merger in 2015, the combined company's biggest business was chips for TV set-top boxes and broadband routers. Broadcom still makes Wi-Fi chips used in laptops as well as the iPhone and other smartphones. After a failed bid to buy mobile chip giant Qualcomm in 2018, Broadcom turned its attention to software companies. The capstone of its spending spree came in 2022 with the announced acquisition of server virtualization software vendor VMware for $61 billion. Software accounted for 41% of Broadcom's $14 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, thanks in part to VMware. What's exciting Wall Street is Broadcom's role working with cloud providers to build custom chips for AI. The company's XPUs are generally simpler and less expensive to operate than Nvidia's GPUs, and they're designed to run specific AI programs efficiently.\n\nwatch now\n\nCloud vendors and other large internet companies are spending billions of dollars a year on Nvidia's GPUs so they can build their own models and run AI workloads for customers. Broadcom's success with custom chips is setting up an AI spending showdown with Nvidia, as hyperscale cloud companies look to differentiate their products and services from their rivals. Broadcom's chips aren't for everyone, as only a handful of companies can afford to design and build their own custom processors. \"You have to be a Google, you have to be a Meta , you have to be a Microsoft or an Oracle to be able to use those chips,\" Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Dec. 13, a day after Broadcom's earnings. \"These chips are not meant for everybody.\" While 2024 has been a breakout year for Broadcom \u2014 AI revenue increased 220% \u2014 the month of December has put it in record territory. The stock is up 45% for the month as of Monday's close, 16 percentage points better than its prior best month. On the company's earnings call on Dec. 12, Tan told investors that Broadcom had doubled shipments of its XPUs to its three hyperscale providers. The most well known of the bunch is Google, which counts on the technology for its Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, used to train Apple's AI software released this year. The other two customers, according to analysts, are TikTok parent ByteDance and Meta. Tan said that within about two years, companies could spend between $60 billion and $90 billion on XPUs. \"In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric,\" Tan said of the three hyperscale customers. In addition to AI chips, AI server clusters need powerful networking parts to train the most advanced models. Networking chips for AI accounted for 76% of Broadcom's $4.5 billion of networking sales in the fourth quarter. Broadcom said that, in total, about 40% of its $30.1 billion in 2024 semiconductor sales were related to AI, and that AI revenue would increase 65% in the first quarter to $3.8 billion. \"The degree of success amongst the hyperscalers in their initiatives here is clearly an area up for debate,\" Cantor analyst C.J. Muse, who recommends buying Broadcom shares, wrote in a report on Dec. 18. \"But any way you slice it, the focus here will continue to be a meaningful boon for those levered to custom silicon.\"\n\nIntel's very bad year\n\nwatch now\n\nPrior to 2024, Intel's worst year on the market was 1974, when the stock sank 57%. The seeds for the company's latest stumbles were planted years ago, as Intel missed out on mobile chips to Qualcomm, ARM and Apple. Rival AMD started taking market share in the critical PC and server CPU markets thanks to its productive manufacturing relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company . Intel's manufacturing process has been a notch behind for years, leading to slower and less power-efficient central processing units, or CPUs. But Intel's most costly whiff is in AI \u2014 and it's a big reason Gelsinger was removed. Nvidia's GPUs, originally created for video games, have become the critical hardware in the development of power-hungry AI models. Intel's CPU, formerly the most important and expensive part in a server, has become an afterthought in an AI server. The GPUs Nvidia will ship in 2025 don't even need an Intel CPU \u2014 many of them are paired to an Nvidia-designed ARM-based chip. As Nvidia has reported revenue growth of at least 94% for the past six quarters, Intel has been forced into downsizing mode. Sales have declined in nine of the past 11 periods. Intel announced in August that it was cutting 15,000 jobs, or about 15% of its workforce. \"We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,\" board Chair Frank Yeary said in a Dec. 2 press release announcing Gelsinger's departure. A big problem for Intel is that it lacks a comprehensive AI strategy. It's touted the AI capabilities on its laptop chips to investors, and released an Nvidia competitor called Gaudi 3. But neither the company's AI PC initiative nor its Gaudi chips have gained much traction in the market. Intel's Gaudi 3 sales missed the company's own $500 million target for this year. Late next year, Intel will release a new AI chip that it codenamed Falcon Shores. It won't be built on Gaudi 3 architecture, and will instead be a GPU. \"Is it going to be wonderful? No, but it is a good first step in getting the platform done,\" Intel interim co-CEO Michelle Holthaus said at a financial conference held by Barclays on Dec. 12. Holthaus and fellow interim co-CEO David Zinsner have vowed to focus on Intel's products, leaving the fate of Intel's costly foundry division unclear. Before he left, Gelsinger championed a strategy that involved Intel both finding its footing in the semiconductor market and manufacturing chips to compete with TSMC. In June, at a conference in Taipei, Gelsinger told CNBC that when its factories get up and running, Intel wanted to build \"everybody's AI chips,\" and give companies such as Nvidia and Broadcom an alternative to TSMC. Intel said in September that it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital. But for now, Intel's primary client is Intel. The company said it didn't expect meaningful sales from external customers until 2027. At the Barclays event this month, Zinsner said the separate board for the foundry business is \"getting stood up today.\" More broadly, he indicated that the company is looking to remove complexity and associated costs wherever possible. \"We are going to constantly be scrutinizing where we're spending money, making sure that we're getting the appropriate return,\" Zinsner said.

That new lineup of devices spawns from a baseboard called \u2018Fatcat\u2019, and its name is about as apt as they come. Because, you see, this new board is the jumping-off point for the new wave of Intel Panther Lake-powered Chromebooks we expect to see throughout 2025.\n\nThe above-referenced commit is simply one of many in the Chromium Repositories, and they each point to a future line of Chromebooks that will house the latest, greatest silicon from Intel. As chip makers like MediaTek and Qualcomm continue pushing out desktop-class SoCs of the ARM variety, Intel is facing pressure to deliver better and better battery life while keeping up with performance enhancements and AI capabilities as well. The past few years have been tough as the pressure from ARM chips mount, but Panther Lake looks to be a formidable competitor if it can deliver on the early promises.\n\nWe don\u2019t have firm details on all the upsides of Intel\u2019s newest chips, but mentions of more speed, and improved Xe3 GPU, and more AI prowess are scattered around the web and will all likely be in play. Another big change is the fact that Intel is trying to move away from reliance on TSMC for their chip fabrication, and may bring as much as 70% of it in-house for Panther Lake.\n\nSince I first came across Panther Lake earlier this year, it definitely has a feeling of importance surrounding it. The past few large-core releases from Intel have felt very iterative, and though I don\u2019t think Panther Lake will be some all-new design, there\u2019s definitely the sense that Intel has a lot riding on these chips.\n\nBased on the roadmap, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see any Panther Lake Chromebooks at the (assumed) Chromebook event in the spring, but I definitely see them on the way for the fall of 2025. Timelines on these sorts of things can be tricky, though, so I won\u2019t completely rule out a late spring Panther Lake Chromebook or two just yet.\n\nWhenever they arrive, I\u2019m looking forward to some new Chromebooks to get excited for. Whether or not they have some of the innovations I\u2019m hoping for in the ChromeOS space is yet to be seen, but we definitely need some fresh hardware sooner than later. CES will likely be a bust for Chromebooks once again, but here\u2019s hoping we get some news in early spring that a new Chromebook event is on the horizon. And maybe a tease of a Panther Lake device will be along for the ride.",

            "content": "The first images of Intel\u2019s incoming budget Arrow Lake CPUs have leaked, and surprisingly, they sport an integrated heat spreader (IHS) smaller than the one used for other Core Ultra 200 Series chips (via @harukaze5719 on X).\n\nThe pictures come from the Chinese e-commerce site Taobao, where a merchant has listed the Core Ultra 5 245 and Core Ultra 5 225 for sale before Intel officially launches them. The same merchant is also selling the Core Ultra 7 265 and Core Ultra 9 285. At least in China, the launch of new Core Ultra 200 models is close at hand, and that\u2019s made clear not only because listings are cropping up on Taobao but also since Intel\u2019s China branch has already opened up preorders for many non-K Core Ultra 5 and 7 SKUs.\n\nThe Taobao listings wouldn\u2019t be particularly interesting if it weren\u2019t because the IHS used for the 245 and 225 is noticeably smaller than the one used for the 285, 265, and the unlocked CPUs that Intel launched in October. Specifically, the elevated portion of the smaller IHS, which is the part that makes contact with the CPU cooler, has been slightly shrunk, especially at the top of the chip. The rim, which goes under the CPU bracket on the motherboard, has gotten bigger, and it seems that the overall surface area of the smaller IHS is about the same as that of the original IHS.\n\nChanging the IHS like this would potentially affect how these CPUs slot into LGA 1851 motherboards. While the 245 and 225 are compatible with the LGA 1851 socket, the retention bracket around the socket was designed to also fit the original IHS. For now, we can only guess as to whether the smaller IHS will pose any fitment issues.\n\nAdditionally, the code printed on the IHS of the 245 and 225 starts with a V rather than an L, which is observed on models that use the original IHS, including the unreleased 285 and 265. These codes contain details for where and when Intel CPUs are manufactured, either for the step of the process when the CPU die is fabricated or when the CPU is fully packaged or assembled.\n\nWhile codes starting with L indicate Ireland as the country of origin, V means Vietnam. It seems that Core Ultra 200 CPUs with the original, larger IHS are made in Ireland, and chips using the smaller variant (which seem to only be the 245 and 225 for now) are made in Vietnam.\n\nThe Taobao listings also came with CPU-Z screenshots, and assuming they\u2019re accurate, they show that the 245 and 225 have the same family, model, and stepping identification as the 285.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The smaller IHS could indicate the company has decided to use a smaller heatspreader for models with a smaller die. We've pinged Intel to see if the company will share further details.\n\nWe won\u2019t know the official reasons behind the different IHS until these CPUs officially debut, which is anticipated to happen at CES 2025 next week at Intel\u2019s presentation at the conference.",

            "content": "The following ASRock Challenger Arc B580 was purchased by the author and was not provided by the manufacturer.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever owned a display adapter that hasn\u2019t been used more than thrice. I say this because it made me realise that the last time I purchased a new graphics card was quite literally eight years ago\u2014and that GTX 1070 has gone from PC build to build, landing right into my latest AMD build. That card has pulled it weight far more than I\u2019ve ever seen from a component in the PC sphere, where up to that point it wasn\u2019t unusual to swap GPUs every four years or so (maybe even sooner!) for enthusiast builds. Naturally, as these cards lasted longer and longer, their prices also shot up and through the moon. That 1070 of mine stuck around as long as it did because really, I couldn\u2019t justify blowing an upward of a thousand dollars for a new Nvidia GPU. And considering my experience with AMD/ATI in the past, I wasn\u2019t exactly ready to try out the only other competitor in the graphics space, so I chose to wait for the RTX 5000 series.\n\nPlus, my GTX 1070 was running games just fine even today. I had no real reason to look into an upgrade.\n\nBut waiting stinks. And Intel has recently been making inroads into the GPU sphere of things, most recently with the announcement and release of the Intel Arc Battlemage cards: the B570 and the B580. The latter card maxed out at a $250 USD price point, a target my eyes have nary graced in nearly a decade. Considering the games I had been playing now have been struggling with image quality even at 1080p, I figured it was worth the shot.\n\nThere\u2019s something oddly magical about having a dedicated graphics processor in your PC that isn\u2019t Nvidia or AMD. Granted, it\u2019s not like there were tens of hundreds of competitors in the field, but the likes of Matrox and 3dfx were there. They\u2019ve been gone now with the only other notable graphics team being Intel\u2019s. But their work was largely for their integrated graphics and anyone familiar with their HD series of things knew those were far behind the likes of AMD\u2019s up until the Intel Iris Xe graphics\u2014the high-end variant of which you\u2019re looking at right now. This is the Intel Arc B580 with ASRock\u2019s customisations on top, most of which are design related and with a slight uptick to the boost clocks:\n\nSpecs thanks to Techpowerup.com Intel Arc B580 ASRock Challenger Arc B580 Base Clock 2670 MHz 2670 MHz Boost Clock 2670 MHz 2740 MHz Memory Clock 2375 MHZ 2375 MHz Memory Size, Type, and Bus 12GB GDDR6 192-bit 12GB GDDR6 192-bit Tensor Cores 160 160 RT Cores 20 20\n\nBy all counts, the B580 performs just a bit better than Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4060 cards and for a good fifty dollars or so less, has more Video RAM than the average card in this price range, and features Tensor and RT cores, which enhances the Intel XeSS suite of software used in some games. And being the second generation of dedicated GPUs by Intel, I was hoping that any potential kinks may have been ironed out by now. So, I swooped in a Newegg order while the B580s were available and installed it the day it came in, which was a good 10 days or so by the time of this writing. The ASRock card is a tiny little thing compared to my old 1070, with a reflective back cover and sleek design\u2014with the cooling features double fans and an aluminium heatsink. Hardware installation was much more pleasant compared to my 1070 in my current build and snapped into the PCI-e slot with ease.\n\nThe real issue began with getting the blasted thing to output an image. I\u2019ve swapped GPUs before with no issues. Heck, I\u2019ve concurrently run Nvidia and AMD display adapters with absolutely no issues whatsoever in the past. But the B580 wouldn\u2019t budge and only displayed video once I reset my CMOS battery. I\u2019m not sure what the problem exactly was, but from what I gather the Intel Arc cards rely on resizable BAR as a motherboard feature. Something to keep in mind is that this card might not work with your older motherboard, which stinks a bit for me as it does limit what parts I can use the B580 with once I retire the unit. Either way, once I was able to get a picture, I uninstalled the old Nvidia drivers with DDU and installed Intel\u2019s Arc drivers and was on my merry way.\n\nI\u2019ve spent my time doing my daily workloads with the B580 paired with an AMD Ryzen 9 7900X and 32GB RAM with EXPO-related settings enabled. This also includes playing a lot of different games because a problem with anything not named Nvidia or ATI/AMD is that running into compatibility problems is unfortunately much higher than if I were to go with the status quo. And admittedly, I am a little concerned with future driver support if Intel sees that their dedicated GPU business has no future. Nvidia cards are overpriced and some say that their newer drivers do impact performance on their older cards, but their driver support is unparalleled\u2014I\u2019m of the opinion that the worst fate a component can face is lost driver support, it is the fastest path to future kernel panics and other nuisances that\u2019ll tire out even the most adamant enthusiast. But it\u2019s too early to tell and I hope Intel sees a viable path within the graphics space\u2014possibly even one that takes market share from a waning AMD.\n\nBut I digress! This article will guide you through twenty or so games and applications I have run on the B580. Mind, I went into these games moreso with compatibility and user experience in mind, with only cursory glances at frame rates. There are far better articles and videos out there that stress test Intel\u2019s latest GPU offering. But I like old games with my new ones, and I\u2019ll be mildly frustrated if classics like \u2018No One Lives Forever\u2019 and \u2018Rune Classic\u2019 won\u2019t run like they did with my old but gold GTX 1070. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll look at some newer titles too like \u2018Infinity Nikki\u2019 and \u2018TEKKEN 8\u2019.\n\nA quick specification reminder before we get into this:\n\nWindows 11\n\n1080p @ 144Hz display with Variable Refresh Rate enabled\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 7900X with an integrated GPU AMD Switchable graphics is enabled\n\nCorsair 32GB DDR5 @ 6000MHz with EXPO enabled\n\nThis is a third-person tactical shooter that recently dropped. And already, I\u2019ve run into one problem: the game favours my integrated GPU over the B580, no matter what enforcements I place in Windows and in the game\u2019s settings. I bring this one up because it\u2019s not really the B580\u2019s fault here and, of all the games I\u2019ve run in this list, this is the only one that has been having this problem. I\u2019ve spoken with the game\u2019s customer service and am hoping for a resolution down the line.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t look like that\u2026 Note: I have slowed the video down significantly due to repetitive imagery caused by visual glitching.\n\nDeus Ex\n\nAh, Deus Ex. One of my favourite immersive sims. This game holds up surprisingly well in terms of compatibility, especially considering the number of issues that plague games of its time today. I usually install kentie\u2019s DirectX10 renderer for added renderer features and full control over the game\u2019s graphics functionality, but on older Nvidia hardware I\u2019ve never had issues with running the game\u2019s built-in Direct3D support. Unfortunately, kentie\u2019s renderer is required for the B580 as the game will launch with broken visuals otherwise. The DirectX10 renderer also features a Classic Lighting option which helps those that are looking for a native Deus Ex experience.\n\nOddworld: Abe\u2019s Odyssey\n\nOddworld\u2019s CG cutscenes are barely functional on Intel\u2019s B580\u2014it almost looks like the game is delivering each frame through screen tears. Thankfully, gameplay is playable (although who\u2019d want to miss out on the CGs?). R.E.L.I.V.E. is an absolute necessity if you want to play this classic anyway, but it\u2019s mandatory for Intel\u2019s latest hardware.\n\nSerious Sam 2\n\nRuns great! Serious Sam 2 in all its glory. Helps that this game has seen continuous updates since its release a little over two decades ago.\n\nBinary Domain\n\nRuns great! No comment to make besides very annoying control set ups.\n\nInfinity Nikki\n\nInfinity Nikki is Infold Games\u2019 full 3D introduction for the whimsical Stylist Nikki. Besides being a great 3D open-world adventure and dress up game combo, Infinity Nikki is also drop-dead gorgeous, featuring beautiful 3D models and dense world scenery and lighting. The B580 takes this game on like a champ, running it at full Ultra settings between 40-60 frames per second with little issue. But\u2026 That comes at a cost: the game seems to always run its internal resolution at a much lower percentage than your actual display output. The developer\u2019s likely intended it this way for performance reasons and hoped that you\u2019d use the only DLSS option included to help clean up the image. Sadly, this is an Intel card, and Infinity Nikki has no support for the company\u2019s equivalent XeSS.\n\nBut the good news is that with a bit of tweaking, we can force the game to run at 100% internal resolution\u2014you can find the reddit article here on how to do that. Note that this will choke the card particularly in dense zones such as Stoneville, but all I care about is how that dress on Nikki looks!\n\nThe First Descendant\n\nNexon\u2019s latest third-person looter shooter. Honestly, no matter the upscaling tech or graphical preset used, this game never looks \u201cclear\u201d. Like there are filters upon filters smearing the screen, it always looks so busy. For what it\u2019s worth, the B580 can run this game with a mix of high and ultra settings between 40-50 frames per second with the game\u2019s built in Intel XeSS tech. You can even turn on ray tracing and set it to ultra if you don\u2019t mind a mini-heater and 30 frames per second gameplay!\n\nMirror\u2019s Edge\n\nAnother great runner! Points if you got that one. Nvidia\u2019s PhysX option will murder performance on any non-Nvidia card, so turn that off. And also thank them for contributing awful software that ruins the visuals of games in addition to causing headaches for users on competing hardware.\n\nPair this game with Mirror\u2019s Edge Tweaks for additional VFX options but is otherwise unnecessary.\n\nMMOs (Official and Fan-run)\n\nToontown Rewritten, Star Wars Galaxies Legends, Pirates Online, Wizard101\n\nMMOs are fun! Here are some thoughts on a few classics:\n\nToontown Rewritten \u2013 Run perfect! This developer team in particular has taken great care in optimising Disney\u2019s old code and building a better foundation for the game that makes it run across multiple operating systems and even with controller support.\n\nStar Wars Galaxies: Legends \u2013 Playable. There are visual issues related to lighting that I couldn\u2019t replicate on my GTX 1070 and RTX 3060.\n\nThe Legend of Pirates Online \u2013 Runs perfect! Fan-run MMO of the now defunct Pirates of the Carribean Online game. In my case, the game now runs on this system as I\u2019ve previously been unable to launch this game with my GTX 1070 no matter the PC build.\n\nWizard101 \u2013 Runs perfect! No comments otherwise. It is getting a console port!\n\nNo One Lives Forever\n\nA beloved classic that is outright broken on the B580, even with the Modernizer patch. Requires dgVoodoo to display visuals in any capacity.\n\nThe Typing of the Dead\n\nThis one works great on modern hardware and needs no patches. Chapter 5\u2019s boss exhibits flickering with its unique shadow, but this issue occurs even on Nvidia hardware.\n\nRune Classic\n\nUnplayable. Prepare to be flashbanged with broken visuals if launch the game (I won\u2019t even go through the hassle of recording what happens). Kentie\u2019s DirectX10 renderer is unfortunately not compatible with Rune Classic, making this game more or less unplayable on Intel graphics.\n\nTEKKEN 8\n\nTEKKEN 8 works great! Except for one bizarre issue: Clive\u2019s throw will drop the framerate down to 50 no matter what graphics settings or stage I\u2019ve set. 60 frames per second is mission critical for a fighter and I\u2019m not even sure why this particular animation causes the aforementioned frame drops. Til this issue is fixed, I\u2019ll play on my laptop and Series X.\n\nRayman 2\n\nWorks out-of-box, but exhibits clunky application behaviour not uncommon with games of its time. Using Ray2Fix more or less fixes all those problems.\n\nDoom 3 (Not BFG)\n\nBecause BFG stinks.\n\nWorks great out-of-box but will only run in 4:3 resolutions. Best paired with dhewm3 for added visual functionality, widescreen support, and more importantly\u2014ensure that the game\u2019s stencil shadows and lighting remain untouched. For some reason, screenshots will not render on this GPU, forcing me to load the game through Steam to take screens.\n\nZenless Zone Zero\n\nWorks great! HoyoVerse\u2019s latest 3D action brawler with light dungeon role-playing game elements. You\u2019ll have no issues running this one.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Oblivion\n\nHDR breaks the game. Apparently has been an ongoing issue for years now. This one hurts the most.\n\nWell, that stinks. Unfortunately, a number of classic titles will not run properly (or at all) on the B580. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t surprised\u2014I fully expected some games to outright not function, but these issues are a real stinger for compatibility and for those of us that like to play older titles. From what I can tell, Intel\u2019s graphics team are on the ball with driver updates but considering how some of the issues have impacted Intel graphics for years, I\u2019m not sure if any of these issues will ever be resolved (or at least, resolved within the decade). Nvidia and AMD have the advantage of backwards compatibility that quite literally goes back decades, and I don\u2019t know if Intel is even interested in catching up.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, as a modern display adapter, the B580 holds up very well. Modern games run great on it and for the price, the hardware isn\u2019t shabby at all\u2014it\u2019s a perfect unit for video encoding and Plex needs, for example and I wholeheartedly recommend this card to those folks. But this is a gaming site and the old is also counted with the new. And as I\u2019m not currently planning any Oblivion runs (nor Rune Classic), the B580 will continue to serve my needs up until I either need to jam the 1070 back in for compatibility\u2019s sake. My hope is that Intel will prove me wrong and work to patch these older titles into a working state on their hardware, because as it stands, I can\u2019t recommend the Intel Arc cards to retro gamers. Now if you\u2019re willing to put the time (and as you should with some of these games) you can get them to run on Intel\u2019s latest kits, but as for me, I\u2019ll be poking, prodding, and keeping an eye on Intel to see how they\u2019ll go about fixing these old games. \u220e",

            "content": "Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) has declined by about 60% this year, amid several issues including the loss of market share to rival AMD in both the PC and server space, as well as the industry\u2019s broader transition from CPUs to GPUs in the generative AI era, besides significant manufacturing missteps. Now we believe that Intel stock is undervalued post the sell-off, with our fair estimate of the stock\u2019s coming at $27 per share almost 30% ahead of the current market price on account of the company\u2019s low valuation, potential regulatory benefits under Trump, and the impending rollout of its next-gen 18A fabrication process which could turn the narrative around on the stock. (See our analysis of Intel\u2019s valuation : Expensive or Cheap?) However, there are risks and there remains a decent chance that things could get worse before they get better. In fact, Intel stock has fallen by about 20% over the last month alone. In this analysis, we highlight how Intel stock could fall about 50% from current levels to about $10 per share, considering three key metrics, namely revenues, net margins, and price-to-earnings multiple.\n\nThere\u2019s No Guarantee Of A Revenue Rebound\n\nIntel revenues dropped from $79 billion in 2021 to $54 billion in 2023 as CPU sales declined due to the cooling off of the PC market post-Covid-19 and also due to market share gains by rival AMD and threats from ARM-based chipsets which are more portable and power efficient compared to Intel\u2019s x86 chips. The surge in demand for GPU chips for AI applications- an area where Intel has a relatively limited presence \u2013 has also hurt. While the PC market is recovering with sales projected to grow by low single-digits this year, Intel\u2019s revenues don\u2019t look like they see meaningful recovery just yet, with consensus estimates projecting a 3% dip in sales this year while estimating a 6% growth next year. There remains a possibility that Intel could see its revenues stagnate in the interim due to a few factors. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.\n\nWhy?\n\nIntel is betting big on the foundry model \u2013 essentially using its manufacturing capabilities to make chips for external customers \u2013 to turn around its business. However, there\u2019s no guarantee that this will pay off. The company\u2019s latest 18A process, its most advanced manufacturing technology to date, is the cornerstone of its foundry business and there have been some positive developments of late. (See Is Intel Foundry set for a comeback?) That said, Intel\u2019s track record on internal execution raises concerns. Intel\u2019s recent transitions to advanced process nodes have been quite inconsistent. For example, the 10nm node faced significant yield and manufacturing setbacks a few years ago. Similar challenges could arise with the 18A process. These difficulties even forced Intel to outsource a part of the fabrication of its newer chips to Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. Given Intel\u2019s struggles in manufacturing its chips, it\u2019s fair to question whether it can be reliably counted upon to produce chips for others at scale. Earlier this month, Intel announced that CEO Pat Gelsinger who was the architect of the foundry pivot would be resigning from the company. Separately, shareholders also filed a lawsuit last week claiming that Intel\u2019s top executives made false and misleading statements regarding its Foundry business violating federal securities laws. These developments may not inspire confidence for the foundry business.\n\nIntel\u2019s CPU business could face further pressure. While AMD has gained market share in both the data center and PC markets, more competition could be in the offing. The generative AI era could open the doors to more competition as PC makers look to incorporate more AI smarts into their devices. For instance, both chip-designer ARM and mobile chipset specialist Qualcomm are pushing into the PC space and Microsoft\u2019s latest Copilot+ PCs use ARM chips that offer AI features and consume less power. There could be challenges on the server front as accelerated computing servers used for generative AI applications typically require just one CPU for eight or more GPUs in AI servers. Moreover, GPU makers such as Nvidia are playing a bigger role in overall server system design, looking to replace CPUs from the likes of Intel with lower-powered ARM chips instead of Intel\u2019s. This could impact Intel\u2019s bread-and-butter business.\n\nIntel is clearly on the back foot. While the company is keen to build momentum, there are challenges here. Employee morale is unlikely too high, after a slew of layoffs and cost-cutting initiatives. Customers and buyers could also rethink committing to Intel\u2019s products and services. Consumers want the \u2018best\u2019 and if they believe that Intel isn\u2019t the future \u2013 it\u2019s less likely to be the choice for customers today. Everything becomes just a bit harder. Intel revenues are projected at roughly $52 billion for this year per consensus estimates and there is a possibility that sales could grow at a level of just about 2% per year to about $54 billion by 2026, due to the factors above.\n\nIntel\u2019s Margins Can Contract Further\n\nIntel\u2019s adjusted net margins (net income, or profits after expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) have been on a declining trajectory \u2013 they fell from levels of over 28% in 2021 (and in years before that) to about 11% in 2022 amid declining sales and market share losses. Adjusted net margins fell to just about 8.5% in 2023 due to further sales declines and considerable losses in the foundry business. There remains a possibility that margins could fall to about 5% in the near term.\n\nWhy?\n\nCosts associated with the foundry ramp-up could hurt Intel\u2019s bottom line. For instance, achieving good production yields with the new 18A process could take time. Moreover, Intel\u2019s move to outsource production of its Arrow Lake chip to TSMC could potentially reduce the utilization of its own manufacturing facilities in the near term. Intel has also not exactly been known for production efficiency. For perspective, in 2023, Intel\u2019s foundry business reported an operating loss of $7 billion on sales of $18.9 billion, and the business is expected to see revenues contract this year while remaining loss-making. Separately, higher competition in the CPU space \u2013 where there are new entrants such as Qualcomm and ARM \u2013 could possibly prompt Intel to resort to some level of discounting, impacting its margins.\n\nHow does this impact Intel\u2019s valuation?\n\nNow at the current market price of about $20 per share, Intel trades at about 19x 2023 earnings and about 20x estimated 2025 earnings. The company is projected to post a loss in 2024. If we combine the scenario we detailed above \u2013 which assumes an average of just about 2% annual revenue growth between 2023 and 2026 with margins falling to about 5% \u2013 this means that adjusted net income could fall from about $4.4 billion in 2023 ($1.05 per share) to about $2.75 billion in 2026 ($0.66), a 37% decline compared to 2023. Bad times make it easier to imagine worse times \u2013 and when that happens, things can spiral causing investors to assign an even lower multiple to Intel re-assessing Intel\u2019s recovery path. For example, if Intel\u2019s investors assign a multiple of 15x following its continued underperformance, this would translate into a stock price of roughly $10 per share.\n\nWhat about the time horizon for this negative-return scenario? While our example illustrates this for a 2026 timeline, in practice, it won\u2019t make much difference whether it takes two years or four. If the competitive threat plays out, with Intel also continuing to struggle with manufacturing, there is a possibility of a meaningful correction in the stock.\n\nThe decrease in INTC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, and 95% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nWith all that being said, we do believe it pays to be patient \u2013 and patient investors and customers will be rewarded. We highlight the catalysts for Intel stock recovery in this analysis. This is a storied company with a glorious past and valuable know-how in a growing market. Our analysis suggests that a win will be at hand \u2013 it just may not be quick and may require patience.\n\nReturns Dec 2024\n\nMTD [1] 2024\n\nYTD [1] 2017-24\n\nTotal [2] INTC Return -16% -59% -31% S&P 500 Return -1% 25% 167% Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio -4% 18% 775%\n\n[1] Returns as of 12/24/2024\n\n[2] Cumulative total returns since the end of 2016\n\nInvest with Trefis Market-Beating Portfolios\n\nSee all Trefis Price Estimates\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "As we await budget Arrow Lake chips next year, Intel China has initiated pre-orders for these processors ahead of their global rollout. The official account of Intel Consumer Products on Weibo announced JD as its partner for the pre-sale event, starting tonight with shipping scheduled for January 13, aligning these processors for a CES unveil. This is slightly unusual since Intel's launch procedures typically involve unveiling a given processor series, followed by retail availability once the set embargo date lifts. While this could be a small inadvertent error at Intel's end, it gives us some insight as to what CPUs are launching next month.\n\nAlthough the Weibo post doesn't mention non-K CPUs, the release window suggests they're the target. Moreover, a quick look over the shared JD retail link spells out the following SKUs: Core Ultra 5 225F, Core Ultra 5 230F, Core Ultra 7 265F, Core Ultra 7 265, and Core Ultra 9 285. When compared against previous leaks, JD is missing a few SKUs but they'll likely surface when pre-orders go live. The pre-sale is expected to start at 22:00 in China tonight with deliveries slated for two weeks later on the evening of January 13.\n\nDespite the focus on the locked non-K family, the accompanying images still showcase the boxed packaging of unlocked Arrow Lake processors. However, this could have been a small mistake since the text clearly mentions unreleased non-K SKUs. We were unable to find any 35W Arrow Lake-T or a Core Ultra 3 200 processor (successor to Intel's i3-series) in the marketing material. Early data suggests a small uptick in the pricing but we'll wait for an official announcement from Intel on that matter.\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: Weibo (Image credit: JD (Image credit: Intel\n\nIntel revealed its Arrow Lake-S or the Core Ultra 200S processors in November. Based on our review of the initial flagship, the lackluster performance and subpar gaming numbers left a lot to be desired. Turns out, most of these issues probably stemmed from poor software which Intel addressed through Windows Updates and a set of BIOS optimizations. The 0x114 microcode is said to bring another uplift in performance measuring in the single-digit territory. We can expect this patch to arrive by January, however, some partners are already pushing beta BIOS updates with the new microcode and updated CSME firmware. Hence, the Arrow Lake platform is likely to be in decent shape for these new 65W processors, targeted at budget-conscious consumers.\n\nDespite the apparent performance drawbacks, Intel's Arrow Lake architecture is quite efficient which should be a major selling point for budget 65W and 35W chips. Of course, you wouldn't expect the average consumer to pair these CPUs with a flagship Z890 motherboard. However, Intel China has not addressed the availability of mainstream motherboards. So, it seems we'll have to wait until CES for partners to unveil their B860 and H810 offerings.\n\nIn terms of platform adoption, AM5 has a significant edge as it was unveiled two years earlier; offering ample time for platform optimizations and for prices to settle. Moreover, AM5 will be supported into 2027 and might be compatible with Zen 6, if AMD follows a two-year cadence. Intel hasn't pushed a formal statement regarding the longevity of LGA 1851, leaving early adopters shirked.",

The second batch of Intel Arrow Lake desktop CPUs will contain only Non-K CPUs, including some F models as well. We have reported several of these SKUs in the past few days, and these will be officially unveiled at CES 2025, where Intel will have its events from January 6 to January 10.\n\nAt the same time, expect its board partners to release newer 800-series motherboards, including the B860 and H810, which were spotted recently. The Core Ultra 200 non-K CPUs are aimed at the budget market segment for users who don't need overclocking. Apart from regular non-K chips, there will be F variants, which will have no integrated graphics and will be even cheaper. Then, there are a few \"T\" variants, which will be ultra-power-efficient SKUs for compact systems.\n\nImage Credits: Weibo\n\nThe pre-sale will start at 22:00 China local time. The Intel China page on Weibo announced,\n\nNew architecture, better power consumption, enjoy the experience! Creative inspiration without boundaries! Game experience without competition!\n\nPerformance-wise, expect these chips to be slower than their K counterparts since they bring lower clocks and cannot be overclocked. This is why Intel has a budget 800-series motherboard that will allow users to save some good cash on their PCs. We will hear more about their specs, features, and pricing at the event, but don't be surprised if we receive them before the official launch, which is quite common.\n\nIntel Arrow Lake-S Desktop CPU Lineup (Preliminary):",

Not only is it relatively affordable at $249 (when you can find it in stock from a first-party seller, that is), but it boasts 12GB of GDDR6 memory. That's notable, given the blow back NVIDIA has received for equipping some its models with just 8GB of VRAM. Well, it turns out there could be a professional variant in the mix with even more video memory\u2014twice as much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's according to a report by Quantum Bits (via Google Translate), which claims a \"larger memory version\" of Battlemage will make a 2025 debut. The site says it received an \"insider tip\" suggesting that Intel took note of the burgeoning market for artificial intelligence (AI) products and solutions, and adjusted its discrete GPU roadmap to include a Pro series model with 24GB of VRAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, X/Twitter user Tomasz Gawro\u0144ski (@GawroskiT) had posted a screenshot of a purported shipping manifesto of a Battlemage GPU in clamshell form earlier this month, at the time positing that it could be a 32GB \"killer AI card.\" In response to the new report, he commented, \"Well, 2 weeks ago I saw B580 in clamshell, so 24GB may be true.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the early going, Battlemage is exclusive to the mainstream consumer market. However, it's worth noting that Intel released a professional line of Arc Alchemist GPUs, both in desktop/workstation (Arc Pro A40, A50, and A60) and mobile/laptop form. Those Pro GPU solutions top out at 12GB of VRAM, on the Arc Pro A60.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the rise of AI and a second-generation GPU architecture, it's certainly conceivable that we'll see a 24GB Battlemage model for the Pro segment. The bigger question mark is which segment Intel will target, be it workstations or data centers. We shall see, but it wouldn't surprise us at all if this rumor ends being true.\n\n",

All prices are subject to change, and this article only reflects the prices available at time of publication.\n\nIntel\u2019s Alder Lake-N processors have proven popular with budget laptop, Chromebook, and mini PC makers since they first debuted nearly two years ago. These chips are basically what you get if you take a 12th-gen Intel Core processor and equip it with entry-level integrated graphics and up to eight Efficiency cores, but no Performance cores.\n\nThe resulting processors may not be speed demons, but they\u2019re surprisingly adequate for many basic computing tasks, media playback, and even some light gaming. Now Intel is preparing to expand the lineup with four new chips that are\u2026 a little faster. Maybe.\n\nIntel hasn\u2019t officially confirmed that it has any new Alder Lake-N processors on the way, but details started leaking this fall when companies like Asus started to introduce mini PCs powered by some of the new chips.\n\nSince then we\u2019ve seen a bunch of mini PCs hit the streets with a processor that Intel has yet to actually announce: the Intel Processor N150 chip with 4 cores, 4 threads, and a 6 watt TDP. This processor is basically a modest spec bump over the Intel N100, with support for CPU frequencies that are up to 200 MHz higher and GPU speeds up to 250 MHz higher.\n\nIn terms of real-world performance, it\u2019s unclear if you\u2019ll notice any real improvement. Early reviews suggest you won\u2019t, but it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Intel hasn\u2019t even acknowledged this processor exists yet, so we could see performance improvements through future software updates.\n\nWe also haven\u2019t seen any real-world tests of the other new chips Intel is launching. Leaks suggest there will also be Intel Core N250, Core 3 N350, and Core 3 N355 processors. And now @jaykihn0 has shared even more details about these upcoming processors, showing how they compare with their predecessors.\n\nAll of the new chips are expected to feature the same Gracemont CPU architecture and Intel UHD graphics as Alder Lake-N chips, but they\u2019re expected to use the code-name Twin Lake (or TWL) rather than Alder Lake-N, even though they\u2019re remarkably similar.\n\nSo what\u2019s new? It looks like we can expect slightly higher CPU and graphics frequencies across the board.\n\nChip Cores Threads Base / Boost freq L3 cache GPU Power *Core 3 N355 8 8 3 GHz / 3.9 GHz 6MB Intel UHD (32EU / up to 1.35 GHz) 15W Core i3-N305 8 8 Up to 3.8 GHz 6MB Intel UHD (32EU / up to 1.25 GHz) 15W Intel Processor N97 4 4 Up to 3.6 GHz 6MB Intel UHD (24EU / up to 1.2 GHz) 12W Intel Processor N95 4 4 Up to 3.4 GHz 6MB Intel UHD (16EU / up to 1.2 GHz) 15W *Core 3 350 8 8 2.6 GHz / 3.9 GHz 6MB Intel UHD (32EU / up to 1.35 GHz) 7W Core i3-N300 8 8 Up to 3.8 GHz 6MB Intel UHD (32EU / up to 1.25 GHz) 7W *N250 4 4 3.2 GHz / 3.8 GHz 6MB Intel UHD (32EU / up to 1.25 GHz) 6W Intel Processor N200 4 4 Up to 3.7 GHz 6MB Intel UHD (32EU / up to 750 MHz) 6W *N150 4 4 2.9 GHz / 3.6 GHz 6MB Intel UHD (24EU / up to 1 GHz) 6W Intel Processor N100 4 4 Up to 3.4 GHz 6MB Intel UHD (24EU / up to 750 MHz) 6W Intel Processor N50 2 2 Up to 3.4 GHz 6MB Intel UHD (16EU / up to 750 MHz) 6W\n\n*Twin Lake chips are marked in bold with an asterisk.\n\nWhile it would have been nice to see Intel push the boundary a bit further with its next-gen chips for budget computers, Alder Lake-N processors are still a pretty strong option for cheap, low-power computers nearly two years after they first launched. So I\u2019m not too mad to see Intel expanding its offerings in this space\u2026 although given the results of early tests on the Intel N150, I can\u2019t help but wonder if the new chips will actually bring anything new to the table of releasing new processors with higher clock speeds has more to do with marketing than performance.\n\nOdds are that we won\u2019t have long to wait for an official announcement \u2013 Intel has a CES 2025 keynote scheduled for Monday, January 6, 2025.\n\nvia Tom\u2019s Hardware\n\nSupport Liliputing Liliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links (if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on Amazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).
