            "content": "Intuit (INTU) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software have returned +0.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Intuit falls in, has lost 0.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Intuit is expected to post earnings of $11.01 per share, indicating a change of +11.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.31 points to a change of +14% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22 indicates a change of +13.9% from what Intuit is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intuit is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

            "content": "Investors in Intuit Inc (Symbol: INTU) saw new options begin trading today, for the May 23rd expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTU options chain for the new May 23rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $600.00 strike price has a current bid of $21.80. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $600.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $578.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTU, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $607.91/share today.\n\nBecause the $600.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.63% return on the cash commitment, or 26.52% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intuit Inc, and highlighting in green where the $600.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $615.00 strike price has a current bid of $24.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTU stock at the current price level of $607.91/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $615.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.21% if the stock gets called away at the May 23rd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTU shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intuit Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTU's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $615.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $615.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.05% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.54% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 33%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $607.91) to be 31%.

            "content": "The Virtual Expert Platform built by Intuit is a proving ground for Canada\u2019s top engineering talent.\n\nWhen Akshay Singh first started filing his taxes after university, everything was simple.\n\nBut after marriage and kids, life got more complex and his tax equations grew more complex and daunting too. The once straightforward paperwork evolved into what felt like an overwhelming challenge, filled with new deductions and credits that were difficult to navigate.\n\n\u201cOver time, I totally lost the confidence to file my own taxes,\u201d Singh said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, a huge opportunity, and a great learning journey.\u201d Akshay Singh, Intuit\n\nToday, Singh is an Engineering Group Manager at Intuit.\n\nIntuit\u2019s AI-driven expert platform powers TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, which are used by approximately 100 million people and businesses around the world.\n\nFrom that vantage point, Singh has seen firsthand how many people struggle with the same uncertainty, and now he has the opportunity to improve the technology that helps people file taxes, manage payroll, track business expenses, and more.\n\nFor decades, Intuit\u2019s do-it-yourself financial technology made tax filing easier for those with simple returns. But for people like Singh with more complex situations that could benefit from additional guidance from a financial expert, the company knew it had to find an effortless way to connect people to the expertise they needed, and help them feel more confident in their finances.\n\nEnter Intuit\u2019s Virtual Expert Platform (VEP): a capability that combines AI, expert advice, and a decades-long understanding of customer needs.\n\nWith VEP, Intuit doesn\u2019t have to wait for customers to ask for help while using their platform. Instead, it is able to anticipate their needs and proactively offer solutions, through a unique hybrid of AI and human expertise. The platform uses AI to connect people with the right tax or bookkeeping expertise when they need help, making expert support faster and more accessible.\n\nThe Virtual Expert Platform uses AI to summarize customer calls for Intuit\u2019s tax and accounting pros.\n\nIntuit is further enhancing its platform through an increased focus on delivering \u201cdone-for-you\u201d agentic AI experiences, where the company automates tasks, end-to-end workflows, and entire functions, and connects customers to one of its more than 12,000 AI-enabled human experts for that last mile or to complete all of the work.\n\nIntuit automatically uploads data the customer has connected, saving experts from manual data entry and searching various forums for customer details to make the first interaction a standout experience.\n\nIntuit\u2019s experts can complete the customer\u2019s tax return in as little as two hours, offering proactive and personalized assistance, and providing opportunities for customers to access their money instantly.\n\n\u201cTaxes and finances are complicated, and our customers want expert help without the hassle,\u201d said Shilpa Reddy, who leads the VEP as Vice President at Intuit. \u201cOur platform helps customers get the right level of expertise, whether from AI or a human expert, so they can maximize their money with less effort and greater confidence.\u201d\n\nA chance for true ownership\n\nThe Intuit engineers who work on VEP were drawn to this work for different reasons.\n\nSingh was drawn in by the appeal of the problem itself, and the chance to build technology that is used by millions of people each year.\n\nNicholas Yee, on the other hand, was drawn by the potential of building something foundational for a company like Intuit, in the heart of Toronto\u2019s tech scene. Yee, who had previously worked in banking, startups, and scale-ups, saw VEP as an opportunity to work with AI and shape a team and product from the ground up. Today, he is a Senior Software Engineering Manager with the VEP team.\n\n\u201cI was excited to be part of a growth organization and get to help build out a team, build out a culture, and do that in Toronto,\u201d Yee said.\n\nNicholas Yee, Senior Software Engineering Manager at Intuit.\n\nWhen he joined, his focus was on finding people eager to push AI forward and experiment quickly. He wanted to shape the product, test ideas with real users, and make decisions that directly impact how millions of people access financial help. At Intuit, that\u2019s exactly what he found.\n\n\u201cOne of the things about my team is that we\u2019re told to be experimental, to try things out,\u201d Yee said\u200b. \u201cI thought that was a great opportunity, since it allowed us to work at the speed of a startup, with the scale of a globally trusted brand.\u201d\n\nExperiments at Intuit are driven by data. Behind the scenes, teams analyze real-time customer interactions to identify the next problem to tackle and where AI can make the biggest impact.\n\nThe system behind VEP evaluates availability, expertise, and urgency before routing a case. If AI can resolve the issue, it steps in. If not, VEP escalates the request, connecting the customer to a tax or bookkeeping professional instantly. AI also enhances the expert experience by providing relevant insights and support to improve interactions with customers.\n\nAI plays a role in the process, but it doesn\u2019t replace the human connection that expertise depends on. \u201cWe are building so that humans will always be in the loop in the way we think about AI,\u201d Reddy added.\n\nThis interplay between machine learning and human support is the heart of the VEP model. Intuit wanted to build a system that could predict customer intent, and surface the right kind of support, whether that is AI-driven assistance or access to real human expertise.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to build AI-powered features to help our experts focus on the conversation with the customer by automating tasks like note-taking, searching for relevant resources that they can share with the customer, or even making recommendations on the best way to solve the customer\u2019s issue. Our goal is to ensure that our experts have all the tools they need to provide the best customer experience,\u201d Yee added.\n\nFor engineers, working on something like Intuit\u2019s Virtual Expert Platform is a rare challenge. The stakes are high, the scale is massive, and the impact is immediate.\n\nA culture of experimentation\n\nExperimentation has shaped Intuit\u2019s approach to product development from the start. In 1983, co-founder Scott Cook launched \u201cFollow-Me-Homes,\u201d a practice where engineers observe real customers using the software in their own environments. The idea was simple: watch, listen, and learn, rather than assume.\n\n\u201cWe as engineers actually get to see experts using the product, which is a very unique opportunity,\u201d Yee added. \u201cThese are also really insightful. Hearing what they like, what they don\u2019t like, and seeing what their experience is like\u2014it really helps me get a better understanding of the customer.\u201d\n\nFollow-Me-Homes continue decades later alongside Intuit\u2019s Design for Delight framework, ensuring teams replace guesswork with firsthand insight. Intuit employees\u2014not just engineers or designers\u2014have access to training on design thinking as part of the company\u2019s focus on customer-driven innovation.\n\nEngineers are also embedded with product teams and designers to make decisions that define how financial expertise is delivered. This requires strategic thinking about AI, including how the platform analyzes customer queries to understand their intent.\n\nSingh sees this evolution in AI\u2019s abilities as foundational to the bigger opportunities ahead.\n\n\u201cWe are really excited and deeply invested in making more AI-native experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been investing in AI for more than a decade, and even with the experiences that are serving users today, we are getting an opportunity to rethink them in a new way.\u201d\n\nThe team is still experimenting, refining, and figuring out how to push the platform forward. For Singh, that\u2019s what makes the work exciting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, a huge opportunity, and a great learning journey,\u201d he said.\n\nPRESENTED BY\n\nIntuit is building the future of AI-driven expertise and is looking for engineers to help shape it.

(Nasdaq: INTU), the global fintech company behind TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, has launched the Intuit Small Business Growth Council, a new initiative designed to drive AI and digital adoption among UK small businesses.\n\nThe Council, made up of 18 digitally-connected businesses, aims to amplify small business voices in shaping policies that foster innovation and economic growth. Research shows that businesses leveraging digital tools are 2.4 times more likely to boost productivity and 2.3 times more likely to increase revenue, yet over 25% of UK small businesses still lack basic digital adoption.\n\nIntuit will host a roundtable with the Council at the Department of Business and Trade today. Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi and The Rt Hon Jonathan Reynolds MP, Secretary of State for Business and Trade will lead the roundtable discussion with Small Business Council members: Afiya Titus, Co-founder, Coco Financial; Emma Thomson, Founder, Gemz by Emz; and James Vincent, Co-founder, Hot Source Creative.\n\nAs the UK government prioritises digital reform and AI adoption, the Intuit Small Business Growth Council will help ensure small businesses are at the heart of this transformation and given the consideration and support to access these tools. By championing policies that make AI and digital tools more accessible, the Council will help small businesses harness technology to drive growth and efficiency. Research shows that if the UK\u2019s 1.1 million micro businesses doubled their uptake of AI technology, it could unlock a \u00a316.6 billion productivity boost. The initiative underscores Intuit\u2019s commitment to empowering small businesses with the tools, resources, and advocacy they need to thrive in the digital economy.\n\nA Proven Model for Small Business Advocacy\n\nThe Intuit Small Business Growth Council builds on the success of the Intuit Small Business Council in the United States, which has helped drive meaningful policy changes. The US Council\u2019s advocacy led to the introduction of the Small Business Technological Innovation Act (S.305). The bipartisan legislation would make explicit that loans backed by the US Small Business Administration (SBA) can be used to fund the adoption of digital tools and technology by small businesses.\n\nThe UK Council brings together entrepreneurs from diverse industries, ensuring a broad range of expertise and perspectives on the opportunities and challenges of digital adoption, are brought to the table. Focused on advocacy by small businesses for small businesses, the Council will put their voices at the forefront of conversations with key policy makers across the UK.\n\nThe Council will focus on three core areas:\n\nDriving Digital Adoption \u2013 Helping more small businesses embrace digital tools by tackling barriers like cost and complexity. The Council will advocate for better support, incentives, and resources to ensure businesses can fully benefit from digital transformation. Simplifying Business Administration \u2013 Helping small businesses save time and reduce complexity by advocating for smarter, digital-first solutions. For example, Making Tax Digital (MTD) has already saved UK businesses up to \u00a3915 million, yet further improvements could unlock even greater efficiencies. The Council will champion efforts to streamline tax processes and cut administrative burdens, allowing small firms to focus on growth. Democratising Access to AI \u2013 Ensuring small businesses aren\u2019t left behind in the AI revolution. The Council will work to make AI tools more accessible and practical for small businesses, while ensuring their voices are heard in key industry and policy discussions.\n\nSasan Goodarzi, CEO of Intuit, says: \u201cWhen businesses succeed, communities and economies prosper. Together with the UK government\u2019s focus on digital adoption, we can fuel the success of small businesses with the use of data and AI to automate and complete tasks and workflows, from lead to cash, helping every business thrive.

            "content": "Intuit announced improvements to its Intuit Enterprise Suite product, released six months ago, centered around workflow automation and data analytics and payroll.\n\nAmong the changes, accountants can now perform intercompany allocations directly from the bank feed, expense form or bill, as well as pre-assign accounts for their clients' transactions so they can allocate them across various entities, which enables streamlined transaction management without the manual work of selecting accounts or creating separate journal entries. Further, accountants will now be able to map default accounts for transactions between specific entity groupings. The update also features a \"multi-entity hub,\" letting users monitor KPIs like sales, expenses, profit and loss, AR and AP across entities at a glance. They can filter by time period or entity and use shortcuts to access reports and support resources.\n\nAccountants can now choose which entities to include when they create consolidated reports, allowing them to scroll through multiple entities side-by-side with fixed columns for Description, Elimination and Total; there are also more options for exporting spreadsheets.\n\nThe software also now features the ability to use business data to access customized projections of revenues, expenses and profits at a dimensional level in order to pinpoint profitable areas and opportunities for improvement based on the entity's specific needs and characteristics, like department, region, program, fund or product line. For example, accountants can leverage their client's existing budgets, or the last three, six, nine or 12 months of historical data, to generate precise forecasts that extend up to three years, according to Intuit. Accountants can also apply rules to various dimensions and classes to create a \"dimensional forecast,\" as well as convert their work into a dimensional budget. Intuit Enterprise Suite will autosave these assets so no work gets lost.\n\nWorkflow updates include the ability to create and import project budgets in order to monitor client data from one connected system; accountants will be able to import a budget from a spreadsheet and assign dimensions to line items, as well as have access to an AI-powered tool that can help find and address duplications and mismatches along the way. Users will also be able to make reusable custom task templates or choose from a library of standard and industry-specific templates. Accountants will be able to track the profitability of their clients' projects and use actionable AI suggestions and predictive strategies to help clients achieve profit benchmarks.\n\nFinally, Intuit has added features for managing a workforce. This includes the ability to correct paychecks for closed quarters, meaning users can edit, backdate and void past-quarter paychecks in Intuit Enterprise Suite without having to request support. They can also reverse an employee direct deposit payroll payment in Intuit Enterprise Suite for no additional fee. To make better-informed decisions on promotions and raises, users can track changes to employees' data including their manager, department, pay and job title.\n\nAll the new features are available starting today.\n\n",

(Nasdaq: INTU), the global financial technology platform that makes TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, today announced the launch of the Intuit Small Business Growth Council (Council), a new initiative dedicated to empowering small businesses in the UK through AI and digital adoption.\n\nThe Council, which consists of 18 digitally-connected businesses, will amplify the voices of small businesses in shaping policies that drive innovation and economic growth. Despite clear evidence that digitally connected businesses are 2.4 times more likely to report higher productivity and 2.3 times more likely to see increased revenue, more than 25% of UK small businesses still don\u2019t use basic digital tools.\n\nIntuit will host a roundtable with the Council at the Department of Business and Trade today. Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi and The Rt Hon Jonathan Reynolds MP, Secretary of State for Business and Trade will lead the roundtable discussion with Small Business Council members: Afiya Titus, Co-founder, Coco Financial; Emma Thomson, Founder, Gemz by Emz; and James Vincent, Co-founder, Hot Source Creative.\n\nAs the UK government prioritises digital reform and AI adoption, the Intuit Small Business Growth Council will help ensure small businesses are at the heart of this transformation and given the consideration and support to access these tools. By championing policies that make AI and digital tools more accessible, the Council will help small businesses harness technology to drive growth and efficiency. Research shows that if the UK\u2019s 1.1 million micro businesses doubled their uptake of AI technology, it could unlock a \u00a316.6 billion productivity boost. The initiative underscores Intuit\u2019s commitment to empowering small businesses with the tools, resources, and advocacy they need to thrive in the digital economy.\n\nA Proven Model for Small Business Advocacy\n\nThe Intuit Small Business Growth Council builds on the success of the Intuit Small Business Council in the United States , which has helped drive meaningful policy changes. The US Council\u2019s advocacy led to the introduction of the Small Business Technological Innovation Act (S.305). The bipartisan legislation would make explicit that loans backed by the US Small Business Administration (SBA) can be used to fund the adoption of digital tools and technology by small businesses.\n\nThe UK Council brings together entrepreneurs from diverse industries, ensuring a broad range of expertise and perspectives on the opportunities and challenges of digital adoption are brought to the table. Focused on advocacy by small businesses for small businesses, the Council will put their voices at the forefront of conversations with key policy makers across the UK .\n\nThe Council will focus on three core areas:\n\nDriving Digital Adoption \u2013 Helping more small businesses embrace digital tools by tackling barriers like cost and complexity. The Council will advocate for better support, incentives, and resources to ensure businesses can fully benefit from digital transformation. Simplifying Business Administration \u2013 Helping small businesses save time and reduce complexity by advocating for smarter, digital-first solutions. For example, Making Tax Digital (MTD) has already saved UK businesses up to \u00a3915 million , yet further improvements could unlock even greater efficiencies. The Council will champion efforts to streamline tax processes and cut administrative burdens, allowing small firms to focus on growth. Democratising Access to AI \u2013 Ensuring small businesses aren\u2019t left behind in the AI revolution. The Council will work to make AI tools more accessible and practical for small businesses, while ensuring their voices are heard in key industry and policy discussions.\n\nSasan Goodarzi, CEO of Intuit, says: \u201cWhen businesses succeed, communities and economies prosper. Together with the UK government's focus on digital adoption, we can fuel the success of small businesses with the use of data and AI to automate and complete tasks and workflows, from lead to cash, helping every business thrive. I\u2019m excited for the new Council to bridge this gap and help ensure that UK policies reflect the needs of these entrepreneurs who are critical to the UK economy.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State for Business and Trade, Jonathan Reynolds, said: \u201cAI and digital tools can be game changers for small businesses\u2019 productivity, but we know there are barriers which get in the way of wide-spread adoption, which is why Intuit\u2019s Small Business Growth Council is so important. This Government is working with industry leaders, including groups like the SME Digital Adoption Taskforce, to develop practical solutions addressing these challenges, supporting small businesses to thrive, growing the economy and securing the UK\u2019s future through our Plan for Change.\u201d\n\nRose Sellman-Leava, Small Business Growth Council member and Co-Founder of Inclusive Futures UK , adds, \"I\u2019m incredibly honored to have been invited to become a member of the Intuit Small Business Growth Council. Technology plays a huge part in helping our business make the greatest impact, but too often, policies and support structures don\u2019t reflect our realities. This Council will give small business owners a seat at the table, helping to make sure digital transformation is accessible, practical, and truly beneficial for businesses of all sizes.\"\n\nJames Vincent, Small Business Growth Council member and Co-Founder of Hot Source Creative, says, \"SMEs are eager to embrace digital tools and AI, but challenges like cost, complexity, and regulatory barriers often stand in the way. This Council is about ensuring small businesses aren\u2019t left behind\u2014we need real, practical support to unlock the full potential of digital transformation.\"\n\nLeigh Thomas, Vice President for Europe , the Middle East , and Africa (EMEA), at Intuit, says: \u201cThe Intuit Small Business Growth Council has the chance to build on lessons learned over the last few decades in making sure small business owners\u2019 voices are heard in Westminster. Its members span some of the most tech-forward enterprises and the most cherished traditional businesses. All are eager to play their part in shaping the UK\u2019s digital agenda.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the Small Business Growth Council and its mission, visit the Intuit blog.\n\nAbout Intuit\n\nIntuit is the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for the people and communities we serve.

(Nasdaq: INTU), the global financial technology platform that makes Intuit TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, today announced the launch of its second annual Intuit Hour of Finance Challenge. The Challenge is a national initiative designed to introduce middle and high school students to essential financial literacy skills through interactive activities with real-world scenarios \u2013 in celebration of Financial Literacy Month this April.\n\nThe company launched the Intuit Hour of Finance Challenge in 2024 to encourage students to spend one hour on financial education during Financial Literacy Month in April. The challenge features free lessons on money management through real-world situations that can be completed in under an hour. Participating students play Intuit Prosperity Quest, an interactive, online game. The initiative is open to middle and high schools nationwide and offers schools the opportunity to compete for prizes and the chance to be recognized as a state or national champion.\n\nThe opening of the 2025 Intuit Hour of Finance Challenge coincides with Intuit\u2019s Financial Literacy Forum event, hosted in partnership with the LA Clippers at Intuit Dome in Los Angeles on April 1. Special guests mutli-platinum selling recording artist and entrepreneur Saweetie and former Clippers star and 3-time NBA 6th Man of the Year Lou Williams will join Intuit to inspire students through conversations about money, entrepreneurship, and building long-term financial success.

Now he\u2019s overseeing the most impressive aspect of Intuit\u2019s work: the development of GenOS, the company\u2019s proprietary generative AI operating system for AI development. \u201cAI is the future,\u201d said Srivastava. \u201cWe needed a powerful operating system to empower developers and engineers. So we built one.\u201d\n\nTax season is upon us, and it\u2019s an appropriate moment to discuss the use of artificial intelligence at Intuit, the company behind the bestselling tax software in the U.S. and Canada. That would be TurboTax, which Tom has sometimes described as his favorite computer program. If you haven\u2019t noticed, the U.S. tax code is rather byzantine, but TurboTax makes it bearable even for pretty complex tax returns.\n\nIf you think the time leading up to April 15 is tough for you, think about what it\u2019s like for Intuit. Last year, Intuit filed 44 million returns for TurboTax customers, and the software computed $107 billion in tax refunds. Many of those returns were filed on April 15 itself. Tax day in 2023 involved 185 billion real-time transactions (an average of 11 million transactions per second) for TurboTax, and Intuit processed 14 terabytes of data. Fortunately, Intuit shifted to the cloud in 2017, the same year that Ashok Srivastava arrived as senior vice president and chief data officer (he\u2019s the source of the statistics above). The job doesn\u2019t necessarily require a rocket scientist, but Srivastava is one anyway. He worked for over a decade at NASA. He was also chief data scientist at Verizon for several years.\n\nAI is the future. We needed a powerful operating system to empower developers and engineers. So we built one. Ashok Srivastava\n\nSrivastava\u2019s initial efforts at Intuit were largely focused on driving customer benefits with AI and getting the company\u2019s data in shape. When he arrived, the company\u2019s AI and data assets resided in multiple database silos, with separate teams managing them. With the support of the management team, he began to sponsor investments in new AI and data platforms. Now Intuit has a unified platform across all of its products, as well as processes and roles for data curation and quality. There is a strong focus on data privacy and regulatory compliance, particularly for the customer data cloud.\n\nIn our experience, no data environment is perfect, but this one seems to be especially well managed. It\u2019s opened the way to developing a series of sophisticated analytics and AI capabilities.\n\nAI in TurboTax and Other Intuit Products\n\nWith the help of Srivastava (who also has primary responsibility at Intuit for AI) and his organization, TurboTax is getting smarter all the time, as are other Intuit products like QuickBooks, Credit Karma, and Mailchimp. Last year, the company introduced Intuit Assist, which has smart capabilities for all products, and it has been updated for this year. For TurboTax, the AI features include:\n\nReal-time checks for accuracy as customers do their returns.\n\nPrompts for deductions and credits based on data about what other taxpayers have taken in similar situations.\n\nA personalized assistant that can answer questions about a customer\u2019s specific tax situation.\n\nTurboTax also offers live support from tax experts, who are provided with AI-based advice about how best to address each customer\u2019s tax situation. The live support is a product offering, but there is also free customer service. Srivastava noted that when customers engage with Intuit\u2019s AI experiences, contacts with live support go down by 11% \u2014 a significant decline. AI has saved the organization nearly $90 million in the first half of this fiscal year, Srivastava said.\n\nWhen customers engage with Intuit\u2019s AI experiences, contacts with live support go down by 11%.\n\nAs a long-term user of TurboTax, Tom downloads the Home & Business program to his laptop, and that format doesn\u2019t have much real-time advice. But he has noticed some AI functions this year: He could take photos of W-2s and have the information extracted from them, and he\u2019s received emails from TurboTax with personalized advice about verifying his W-2s and other tax issues. The TurboTax online product has more AI capabilities because the user is connected to the cloud while using it.\n\nIntuit Assist also provides AI services in QuickBooks, the company\u2019s accounting software, and the company\u2019s AI has some advanced AI capabilities in that software, particularly in terms of AI agents. The product now incorporates, for example, several agents that help customers with accounts receivable and payable. One set of agents can dynamically process forms, receipts, and emails to extract key data from them, and another set can create invoices or bills. Customers are very positive about their experience and tell the company these agents have helped them understand their cash flow, Srivastava said.\n\nThe AI Operating System That Makes It Work\n\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect of Intuit\u2019s work in the AI technology domain is GenOS, the company\u2019s proprietary generative AI operating system for AI development. GenOS is the analog of Windows, macOS, or Linux for AI, allowing developers of AI use cases to employ advanced and reusable resources to build their applications. It is, as the name suggests, primarily for generative AI (GenAI), but it also has linkages to an analytical AI platform and is becoming the go-to environment for any form of AI development at Intuit. As Srivastava noted, \u201cAI is the future. We needed a powerful operating system to empower developers and engineers. So we built one.\u201d\n\nGenOS has a number of subcomponents, including:\n\nGenOS AI Workbench : Handles interaction with a variety of large language models, including commercial, internal, and open-source models. It decides which model is most appropriate given the specific task. There are 13 basic models to choose from and as many as 70 modified ones.\n\n: Handles interaction with a variety of large language models, including commercial, internal, and open-source models.

GenRuntime : Viewed by Srivastava as the most important component, it enables orchestration, memory management, planning, execution, and Intuit-specific knowledge retrieval. It is the module that orchestrates AI agents, including the QuickBooks agents mentioned above. Intuit is creating many more agents now. It\u2019s also the module that ties language models to ground truth facts, minimizing hallucinations (responses that contain false or misleading information).\n\n: Viewed by Srivastava as the most important component, it enables orchestration, memory management, planning, execution, and Intuit-specific knowledge retrieval.

It looks across all generative AI experiences and assures that they are operating within built-in guardrails. GenUX: Facilitates the creation of consistent user experiences, with over 140 reusable widgets, patterns, and other interface tools.\n\nThe availability of all of these GenOS capabilities makes it much easier for developers to create new use cases. Soon after GenOS launched, hundreds of teams in the company were building thousands of applications. Although the operating system was originally intended to assist developers and engineers in creating GenAI applications, teams outside development, including marketing and finance, are also using it to do their work.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGenOS is so resilient that when commercial providers go out, Intuit can keep going by automatically switching to other language models. Given the rapid pace of GenAI progress, Intuit\u2019s system does have to be updated regularly with new releases. But like any good operating system, it doesn\u2019t require a lot of human support for users to employ it in their work. Srivastava is not neglecting the human element; the company has built a culture of \u201ccontinuous AI transformation\u201d into the organization.\n\nNeither we nor Srivastava know of any other organization that has a similar operating system for generative AI. This customized system seems very likely to accelerate the pace at which AI is built into Intuit\u2019s products and internal operations. Of course, we won\u2019t be truly happy until the AI agents can simply be instructed, \u201cTurboTax, do my taxes. And get me a good refund.\u201d",

In addition to watching Saweetie perform, students participated in a day of financial empowerment and hands-on workshops.\n\nThe Grammy-nominated artist, born Diamonte Quiava Valentin Harper, is a first-generation college student, entrepreneur and an advocate for financial education.\n\nShe first partnered with Intuit in 2021 to launch the \"Money Moves\" campaign and Tuesday\u2019s events celebrations the expansion of the mission to help young people build real-world money skills and financial confidence.\n\nIntuit is the technology platform behind programs such as TurboTax, Credit Karma and QuickBooks.\n\nSaweetie uses her platform to give back and spread knowledge\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"I think that it's imperative for someone who has my platform to give back to communities that look up to me to communities who look like me, because it's not always that we learn at such a young age what to do with our money and to make sure that we're responsible for it so I just love to pay it forward and to give it back,\" Saweetie explained.\n\nIn addition to performing, she also shared some stories with students about what it was like for her to work multiple jobs while in college, also sharing the importance of how to navigate life after high school.\n\n\"Having a skill set to succeed in the future, to go out there and survive in the real world is really important. And I feel like after they walk across that stage, they get their diploma, they need to know what they're, I wouldn't even say up against, but they just need to have the skill sets to navigate in the world we are in today. And since things are always changing, it's important to teach them that if they can acquire the knowledge, they can apply it to their life. And that's what teaching about financial success is all about,\" she added.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nIntuit Dome and Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, former Microsoft CEO, wanted the arena to be far more than a place to host concerts and basketball games. He also wanted the venue to serve as a place that would benefit the Inglewood community.\n\n\"We\u2019re trying to make sure we support local businesses. We support local people in getting trained and up to speed and support the community,\" he said in a previous interview.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE:",

            "content": "Google, Intuit, Microsoft, Patagonia, Rivian and REI are among a growing number of companies for which the capacity of a renewable electricity project isn\u2019t the most important decision-making metric for signing a contract.\n\nAll six companies are negotiating deals aimed at bringing affordable energy to places where renewable electricity is scarce and other factors, including high poverty levels, have made it difficult for consumers to invest in energy efficiency measures such as home weatherization or updated HVAC systems.\n\nFor example, Microsoft disclosed a multi-year deal Feb. 25 to bring 100 megawatts of solar electricity to 20 communities over the next four years with an initial focus on Louisiana and Arkansas. This is the tech giant\u2019s second transaction with Clearloop, a Nashville, Tennessee, company expanding solar power in underserved locations where projects have a higher impact on grid decarbonization and also provide a positive economic impact.\n\nClearloop uses a project financing approach that lets corporations purchase the environmental attribute certificates of utility-connected projects in regions where renewables penetration is low, said Clearloop Co-founder and CEO Laura Zapata.\n\n\u201cIf the government is not going to make these types of investments, maybe the private sector will,\u201d she said, describing the company\u2019s origin story. One of Clearloop\u2019s co-founders and angel investors is former Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen, who also co-founded Silicon Ranch, the solar developer that acquired Clearloop in October 2021.\n\nCentral theme: community resilience\n\nClearloop prioritizes smaller projects \u2014 typically about 5 megawatts, or enough to power 1,000 homes. A key selling point in rural communities is the ability of distributed solar systems to keep communities online during broader grid outages, Zapata said. That helps get projects approved and typically producing power in under one year. \u201cDeploy, deploy, deploy is the name of the game right now,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother developer winning deals with high-profile corporations is Sol Systems, an independent power producer in Washington, D.C., that manages 7 gigawatts of clean energy projects in 38 states. It has publicly disclosed deals with Google, Microsoft, Patagonia and Rivian, to name a few.\n\nBoth Clearloop and Sol prioritize low-income communities with high irradiance. Investments often come with employment opportunities, investments in local schools and other activities deemed important by local residents.\n\n\u201cYou can still use these projects to implement your goals, but it\u2019s not just about simply extracting the benefits,\u201d said Adaora Ifebigh, senior director of community impact at Sol Systems. \u201cIf you want to be there and show that you\u2019re going to be there, you need to think about things differently.\u201d\n\nConsider Sol\u2019s relationship with Google, which in mid-March pledged another $1.6 million (doubling a previous investment). That money funds grants at rural electric cooperatives in North Carolina and South Carolina for energy efficiency upgrades and other improvements that reduce energy demand and costs.\n\nThe White Pines solar project in Tennessee was funded with investments from Intuit and REI Cooperative. Source: Clearloop\n\nDemonstrable impact for low-income consumers\n\n\u201c[The relationship] directly reduces the energy burden on our members \u2014 particularly during extreme weather months \u2014 without the red tape that often comes with other funding sources,\u201d said Kevin Myers, manager of marketing for the Santee Electric Cooperative in Kingstree, South Carolina. \u201cIt\u2019s not about policy; it\u2019s about people.\u201d\n\nSantee is one of several organizations that receives funding enabled by the Google deal. The co-op, which will receive $200,000 as a result of the new investment, has funded upgrades at 76 homes over the past two years, including weatherization improvements and installations of heat pumps.\n\nThe owners of these homes often don\u2019t qualify for existing programs because they don\u2019t have an adequate credit history or they rent the land where their home is situated \u2014 which is a deal-breaker in some locations, Myers said. \u201cThese funds can be applied directly to the [customers] who need this the absolute most,\u201d he said.\n\nConsider climate, conservation and community\n\nElectric vehicle maker Rivian reviews community development possibilities as part of all its renewable energy investments. Other factors: how a project can reduce emissions on an otherwise dirty grid and whether the project will cause habitat destruction. (Check out its checklist.)\n\nFor example, Rivian teamed up with Patagonia and Sol to back a 50-megawatt project in Stokes County, North Carolina. The funding supported a local robotics program for middle-school students.\n\nRivian\u2019s renewables strategy aims to offset the impact of its manufacturing and add enough clean energy capacity to the grid to support 7 billion miles of carbon-free driving.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for projects that will result in the greatest potential to negate fossil fuels,\u201d said Andrew Peterman, director of advanced energy solutions at Rivian. \u201cWe really think about how we drive grid transformation that is about more than decarbonization.\u201d\n\nFor example, Rivian backed Clearloop\u2019s work in Tennessee because solar generation accounts for less than 1 percent of the electricity there. Rivian is working with Clearloop to add enough solar power to serve charging stations across the state, Peterman said. \u201cThere are sustainability outcomes, but it\u2019s really about enabling the system,\u201d he said.\n\nLet the community lead\n\nSoftware firm Intuit also collaborates with Clearloop. Together with REI, it backed a 2.8-megawatt solar installation in White Pine, Tennessee, that will power at least 400 local households and also provide zero-carbon electricity for REI\u2019s nearby distribution center.\n\n\u201cWe have never put a limit on projects like this, but it does come down to scope \u2014 not only just the clean energy component but also whether it creates co-benefits,\u201d said Debbie Lizt, head of global sustainability at Intuit. \u201cWe want to use the resources that we have to have a positive impact.\u201d\n\nIntuit studies economic impact potential as part of its project selection criteria \u2014 in accord with its corporate mission statement to \u201cpower prosperity around the world.\u201d It prioritizes regions where electricity additions can reduce utility costs, provide exposure to new technologies and potentially create apprenticeship opportunities.\n\nUnlike some other companies supporting small community solar projects, Intuit doesn\u2019t count the renewable energy certificates they generate towards its emissions reduction goals. Rather, it donates them to the community. \u201cThis is important work to do even if it doesn\u2019t serve our direct interests,\u201d Lizt said.",

That is, if the LSU star decides to forego her fourth season of college and instead go professional after three college seasons, something she\u2019s eligible to do because she turns 22 in November.\n\nJohnson, who was one of LSU\u2019s best players in the 2024-25 season, said after LSU\u2019s 72-65 loss to UCLA that she had not yet decided whether or not she would enter the draft, noting that she\u2019d take \u201ceverything\u201d into account.\n\n\u201c[I\u2019ve] got to talk to Coach [Kim] Mulkey, talk to my family,\u201d Johnson said in the locker room , per ESPN. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s tournament run ended with a Sweet Sixteen loss on Sunday. While Johnson struggled in the first half, she ended the night with a 28-point (10-17 FG), 4-assist, 4-rebound, 2-block, 3-steal performance.\n\nFlau'jae Johnson today:\n\n\n\n28 PTS\n\n4 REB\n\n4 AST\n\n4 STL + BLK\n\n\n\nThe 2nd most points in an Elite 8 game in LSU school history (Seimone Augustus - 29 PTS). pic.twitter.com/rr1iucuKKX \u2014 StatMamba (@StatMamba) March 30, 2025\n\nStill, it wasn\u2019t enough to overcome the top-seeded Bruins, who advanced to their first Final Four appearance in program history. LSU falls in the Elite Eight for the second consecutive year following their 2023 NCAA championship.\n\nIs Flau\u2019Jae Johnson WNBA-ready?\n\nJohnson spent three seasons at LSU, averaging 14.6 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game. She demonstrated her three-point shooting ability throughout her college career, hitting 36.3% from beyond the arc.\n\nHer junior year season was her best yet; she averaged a career-best 18.3 points. She was named to the All American third-team. The 5\u201910 guard has the makings of a pro, and the speed and athleticism to thrive in the WNBA.\n\nShe is also one of several women\u2019s college basketball players who are committed to playing in Unrivaled, the new offseason 3-on-3 women\u2019s basketball co-founded by Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart. That offer stands regardless of whether she declares for the draft this year or next.\n\nIf Johnson is to enter the draft, she very well could be a lottery pick. LSU teammate Aneesah Morrow has also entered the 2025 WNBA Draft, as has Johnson\u2019s good friend UConn star Paige Bueckers, who is expected to be picked first overall. Other top picks on most mock drafts include French center Dominique Malonga, USC forward Kiki Iriafen, Notre Dame guards Sonia Citron and Olivia Miles, and Maryland guard Shyanne Sellers. Johnson very well could find herself in the mix \u2014 so long as she doesn\u2019t return for a fourth season at LSU.",

The survey, carried out from March 12\u201319, 2025, among 1,450 verified IT professionals, found that 72% of respondents routinely exceed the 48-hour workweek limit. Shockingly, one in four professionals logs 70 or more hours weekly, contributing to an alarming burnout rate of 83%.\n\nThe survey identifies specific companies where extreme work hours are most prevalent. Organisations like Confluent, Intuit, UiPath, Adobe, Uber, InMobi, Salesforce, Walmart, Oracle, Amazon, and Microsoft lead the list, with a large majority of their employees reporting workweeks beyond the legal limit. Even more concerning, up to 42% of employees at Cisco, Amazon, ServiceNow, Walmart, and VMware admit to working over 70 hours weekly.\n\nExcessive workloads are directly linked to higher burnout rates. While 83% of respondents reported experiencing burnout, the figure exceeds 90% among employees at companies notorious for long work hours. The survey also highlights that 68% of IT professionals feel compelled to respond to work-related messages outside official hours, a behavior partly rooted in remote work habits from the pandemic era but now ingrained in corporate culture.\n\nThe root cause of these extreme work habits appears to be systemic pressure to overwork. A staggering 75% of professionals either feel pressured themselves or have observed colleagues being pushed to work beyond standard hours. This relentless cycle of overwork and burnout reflects a troubling trend within the Indian IT landscape.\n\nDespite the demanding environment, many professionals argue that longer hours do not equate to higher productivity. Additionally, industry leaders like Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy and L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan have come under fire for advocating 70\u201390-hour workweeks.",

Clippers' spiffy new home in Inglewood has the bells and whistles befitting a $2 billion venue \u2014 from boasting five basketball courts to the most leg room of any arena in the NBA to a promise of a frictionless experience at the parking lots and concessions.\n\nBut the Intuit Dome promises to offer something no other venue in the state allows \u2014 the ability to serve alcohol in VIP suites until 4 a.m., thanks to a bill that Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk has signed into law.\n\nAB 3206 would \"authorize alcoholic beverage sales to occur between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. upon the on-sale licensed premises operated in a fully enclosed arena with a seating capacity of at least 18,000 seats located in the City of Inglewood if specified conditions are met,\" according to the bill's language, which matches the description of the Intuit Dome.\n\n\"Instead of authorizing an entire city or jurisdiction to allow after our alcohol sales, we're taking a venue-by-venue approach,\" said Terry Schanz, chief of staff to Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, who authored the bill.\n\nA handful of legislative efforts have failed to expand last call in the state, including one in 2022 to allow cities like West Hollywood to serve alcohol past 2 a.m.\n\nSchanz said those failed attempts have prompted the \"new approach\" in this proposal.\n\n\n\nConcerns are raised\n\nThe exclusivity of this exception had raised concerns.\n\n\"If you have an institution that's open that late, that means added burden, for example, on law enforcement or other local businesses, whether they be gas stations or otherwise,\" said Laurie Levenson, a professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School and a former federal prosecutor.\n\n\"I can see that this was probably done to boost the new stadium,\" Levenson added. But, \"the benefits have to be to the whole community, not just to particular individuals, or that really will bring on scrutiny.\"\n\n\"Questions like, why are they making this exception? Do they really need to make this exception? What is the problem you're trying to solve with this bill? And what are the problems you might be causing with this bill?\" Levenson said.\n\n\n\nBuilt-in guardrails\n\nSchanz said the bill includes a number of measures \u2014 like including a sunset on the bill for future legislative review, a limit on the size of the area to 2,500 square feet where last-call would be extended, and and a cap on the number of patrons to 100 people.\n\n\"A lot of these guardrails are intended to make sure that we are protecting the public health and safety \u2014 not just of the patrons of the venue, but also of the surrounding community,\" Schanz said.\n\nIn addition, he said the Inglewood City Council will need to approve the provision every year until 2030, its built-in sunset date.\n\n\"I don't see that as causing any kind of public safety or public policy concerns,\" Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts said. \"The reality is you're inside of an arena that has its own security in a private club area, with patrons that can afford to pay for very expensive suites. This is not an area of general public congregation.\"\n\nButts added that the 4 a.m. cutoff would only happen on event and game nights, which he calculated to be about 70 days out of the year.\n\n\"AB 3206 complements the over $2 billion of private investment that has been made through the construction of the recently opened Intuit Dome, it's another signal of Inglewood's renaissance that's underway,\" Schanz said.\n\n",

            "content": "At Intuit Academy, we offer a free pathway for people interested in a career as a financial services professional to learn about federal tax returns and become eligible to apply to an entry-level Tax Specialist role. This pathway requires no prior professional experience in tax preparation. The only requirement to apply without having prior experience is to complete our Tax Level 1 and Tax Preparation programs, both of which are completely free and self-paced on Intuit Academy. Below we will go over everything you need to know about applying to the Tax Specialist role.\n\nAbout the Tax Specialist Role\n\nThe Tax Specialist is a remote, entry-level seasonal role at Intuit in the field of tax preparation. While it requires a basic understanding of federal tax preparation by taking the two aforementioned Intuit Academy tax programs, it is also very much a customer-oriented role that requires the ability to communicate effectively in English (Spanish is a plus!) and handle virtual interactions with people across all 50 U.S. states.\n\nThe position is fully remote within the US., and allows you to be flexible in the times and number of hours that you work. Every shift requires a minimum of 4 hours, and you would work 20-40 hours per week between 5AM-9 PM PT. During peak season (March and April), you may be asked to work more than 20 hours a week to meet customer needs.\n\nAs a W-2 employee, the job comes with several perks, including paid sick leave, 401(k) plan with contribution match, employee stock purchase plan, E&O insurance, complimentary TurboTax software and product discounts, and partial internet reimbursement (as hardwired internet connection is a requirement for the job). Once you\u2019re hired, you\u2019ll receive all the equipment you need \u2014 including a laptop and headset \u2014 and plenty of paid on-the-job training to set you up for success.\n\nWhat\u2019s Required\n\nPreviously, we required 2+ years and 30+ paid returns filed per tax season to be hired at TurboTax Live. Now, earning your Tax Preparation badge waives that requirement entirely, and allows you to connect with a recruiter and initiate the interview process for a Tax Specialist role upon completion. You must first complete Tax Level 1 in order to enroll in the Tax Preparation program.\n\nResources to Get You Through Tax Level 1 and Tax Preparation\n\nWe recently launched exam resource guides for both Tax Level 1 and Tax Preparation programs, which are meant to guide you through the exam for each course. Both exams are open book, so you\u2019re allowed to reference any materials you may need. You can also join our Facebook Tax Learner Community to seek help on the course content from other learners making their way through the same programs.\n\nEarning Your Tax Level 1 Badge (8 hour commitment)\n\nTax Level 1 consists of course modules with small quizzes along the way to reinforce your understanding of the content, as well as a practice exam and the final exam. You have 2 attempts to complete the exam, but if you don\u2019t pass after the second attempt, you\u2019ll have to wait 15 days before trying again. The pass rate for the exam is graded on a curve, so you can pass with a less-than-perfect score. Passing this exam unlocks your ability to enroll in the Tax Preparation program.\n\nPlease note: If you\u2019ve indicated that you have 2+ years of recent tax filing experience, with 30+ returns per season, you may be prompted to connect with a recruiter after completing Tax Level 1. However, if you don\u2019t have that experience, please continue on to enroll in Tax Preparation and do not connect with a recruiter at this stage.\n\nEarning Your Tax Preparation Badge (15 hour commitment)\n\nOnce you\u2019ve gained the basic knowledge about federal tax returns from Tax Level 1, the Tax Preparation program consists of completing 13 practice tax returns. You have 10 attempts at each of these practice returns\u2014but you shouldn\u2019t need to max them out, since you\u2019ll be able to review and correct any wrong answers before submitting each practice return.\n\nThe final exam consists of 1 practice return. Once you\u2019ve passed the Tax Preparation exam, you will not only receive a new badge, but you will also see an opportunity to initiate your application process. All you need to do is fill out a form with basic job eligibility questions, which will appear immediately after passing the exam.\n\nHiring Screening\n\nWithin 0-3 business days after submitting the form, you should receive a call or email that invites you to an initial screening to make sure you\u2019re eligible to work at TurboTax Live. This process should be quick and basic, and will typically take up to 15-20 minutes. You\u2019ll have the option to schedule time to speak with a recruiter over the phone, or to use the self-service option online. The choice is yours to make, and neither one is treated preferentially.\n\nWhat to Expect During Your Video Interview\n\nIf you pass the initial screening process, you\u2019ll soon receive an email invitation to create an account on the platform that helps us conduct virtual interviews. The platform will include an introductory video, description of the role you\u2019re applying to, and a practice question \u2014 which we highly encourage you to try out before you begin.\n\nThe recorded video interview will include questions to which you will provide timed answers by looking into your computer camera (please do not use a tablet or phone to conduct the interview). You\u2019re welcome to access any tax-related resources you may have, and use them to prepare and answer your questions\u2014but you cannot use any AI assistance.\n\nOnce you initiate the video interview, you will not be able to pause and return to it later, so please make sure you are ready before you begin. The prompts will be a mix of behavioral and tax-related questions.\n\nAs an entry-level applicant, you will not be expected to know the answers to every tax-related question. Don\u2019t freeze up, and do the best you can; if you\u2019re unable to provide an immediate answer, explain the steps you might take to find the answer.\n\nAfter your video interview is submitted, it may take up to 2 weeks to hear back. A recruiter will review your recorded video and either send you an email if your application is declined, or a phone call if your application is accepted.\n\nTips for Acing the Video Interview\n\nWhen you\u2019re interviewing to be a Tax Specialist, it\u2019s important to remember that this is a customer-facing position where you will be interfacing with people from all 50 states over video or chat. This means that your ability to communicate and provide high quality customer service is a necessity, and your interview evaluation will reflect this requirement.\n\nTo set yourself up for success, make sure you dress appropriately and are located in a quiet space without distractions. Set aside up to 85 minutes to complete the interview in one sitting, as you won\u2019t be able to pause and return to it. Most importantly, make sure that you have a strong internet connection.\n\nOther than that, showcase your people skills by navigating through questions with thoughtfulness and confidence, the way you imagine you would interact with a TurboTax live customer \u2014 and show your recruiter that you\u2019re ready for the job!\n\nOur hiring deadline for Tax Specialists is in early November, so please keep that in mind as you plan your courses. Please also note that if you are located in California, Connecticut, Maryland, Nevada, New York and Oregon, your state has additional requirements in order for you to perform duties in this role \u2014 and we recommend that you look into what those are ahead of time. Those requirements, if applicable, will need to be met once you are offered a position.\n\nBest of luck to you in your application process!\n\nGet started at Intuit Academy\n\n\n\nIf you already have professional tax preparation experience that qualifies you to apply for a more advanced role, we have plenty of other job opportunities for you!

Executives frequently rely on pre-established plans, such as 10b5-1, to maintain transparency.

            "content": "The impact small businesses and accountants have on the economy isn\u2019t so small when you consider that they make up more than 99% of all businesses in the UK. The launch of the new Intuit Small Business Growth Council will bring together entrepreneurs from across the UK to engage directly with policymakers and champion the kinds of policies that will help small businesses turbocharge their growth and productivity.\n\nSmall- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) power the UK economy, representing over 99% of all businesses. They play a crucial role as innovators, local employers, and the cornerstones of communities across the nation. However, SMEs often face significant barriers to success and lack representation in the policy discussions that could address their challenges. As part of Intuit\u2019s mission to power prosperity and improve small business success rates, we are committed to connecting small businesses from across the country with policymakers, bringing real-life perspectives to how policy frameworks that impact small businesses are built.\n\nIntuit is proud to announce the launch of a new Small Business Growth Council in the UK to connect SMEs with policymakers. The Council will serve as a conduit between the business community and government as it explores policies to boost business productivity, competitiveness, and exports. The inaugural Council comprises 18 passionate small business owners and accountants from diverse sectors and geographies. These leaders will engage on behalf of Intuit\u2019s many small businesses nationwide by providing authentic perspectives to shape policy recommendations.\n\nThe Intuit Small Business Growth Council will focus its efforts on advocating for key drivers of small business growth, including driving digital adoption, simplifying and digitising business administration, and democratising access to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDriving digital adoption\n\nIntuit is committed to expanding digital adoption as a critical driver of small business success. Embracing digital tools has become essential for growth and competitiveness. Yet, more than 1 in 4 SMEs in the UK still do not use basic digital tools. Council members will share their insights with the policy community to help identify barriers to adoption and provide inputs on policies that encourage businesses to go digital. Critically, digitally connected small businesses are 2.3x more likely to report higher revenue, highlighting the transformative power of embracing digital tools.\n\nSimplifying and digitising business administration\n\nComplex and time-consuming administrative tasks are a burden for small businesses and a potential inhibitor of economic growth. To address these challenges, the Council will advocate for policies that streamline processes, reduce red tape, and promote digitising business administration, freeing up valuable time and resources for entrepreneurs to focus on innovation and growth. Research shows that the digitisation of business administration could unlock an additional \u00a357 billion for small business growth. Further, digitisation has the potential to help combat the challenges that late payments cause for small businesses. Addressing the issue of late payments could inject an additional \u00a32.5 billion into the economy, making it another important area of focus for the Council.\n\nDemocratising access to AI\n\nAs applications of AI become more ubiquitous, the Council will work to promote ideas around access to AI technologies and the skills needed to leverage them are readily available to small businesses of all sizes. Democratising access to AI is crucial to level the playing field and drive innovation for small businesses. Hearing from the Council\u2014small business owners who are early adopters of AI-powered digital technologies\u2014will be invaluable as the government considers policies to promote equitable access to AI technology and grow the economy through AI innovation. Importantly, small businesses adopting AI could contribute an estimated \u00a3470 billion to the UK economy by 2035.\n\nThe impact of prioritising these policy areas is substantial. With robust government support, UK SMEs can overcome obstacles and achieve sustainable growth, contributing to a thriving national economy. After all, the impact small businesses have on the economy is anything but small.\n\nThank you to the new 2025 Intuit Small Business Growth Council members for their engagement:",

Any amendments require consent by the city. The City Council directed staff Friday to move forward on these recommendations.\n\nAmong the changes proposed in the summer and approved Friday: Basketball would move to the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, gymnastics to Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles, and swimming to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood.\n\nGet top local stories in Southern California delivered to you every morning.

It also asked LA28, the private company overseeing the games, to conduct an independent study by June 30 to examine the economic impact of the proposed changes.\n\n\u201cThe Arena in downtown Los Angeles offers more seats with more hospitality facilities for more spectators to watch one of the more marquee sports of the Games,'' according to a joint report from the City Administrative Office and Chief Legislative Analyst.\n\nCity leaders say the updated plan will yield $162 million in combined additional revenue and savings.\n\nAccording to Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson, the city is on the hook for $270 million if LA28 and the city suffers a loss due to the games. Some of the debt would be paid by the state, but ultimately in the hands of L.A.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely cannot afford that under any circumstance,'' Harris-Dawson said Wednesday. \u201cSo we have to make sure this is done and done right, and done in a way like 1984, where the city of L.A. is left with assets as a result of the Summer Games, as opposed to debt.\u201d\n\nIf approved, the International Olympic Committee executive board is scheduled to confirm the final plan April 9.",

The aim is to direct the customers to the paid services offered by the company, noted the report. Those reports prompted lawmakers to call on the IRS and the FTC to investigate the companies. Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York has already asked two state agencies to look into the allegations, reported CNBC. The report noted lawmakers aren\u2019t only going after H&R Block and Intuit. TaxSlayer, FreeTaxUSA, and 1040.com are also allegedly hiding the free tax tools, employing similar tactics to those used by H&R Block and Intuit.",

As of 31 January, 2025, the company achieved a solid revenue growth rate of approximately 17.04%. This indicates a notable increase in the company's top-line earnings. As compared to its peers, the company achieved a growth rate higher than the average among peers in Information Technology sector.\n\nProfitability Metrics: Unlocking Value\n\nGross Margin: The company shows a low gross margin of 76.36% , indicating concerns regarding cost management and overall profitability relative to its industry counterparts.\n\nEarnings per Share (EPS): Intuit's EPS is a standout, portraying a positive bottom-line trend that exceeds the industry average with a current EPS of 1.68.\n\nDebt Management: With a below-average debt-to-equity ratio of 0.38, Intuit adopts a prudent financial strategy, indicating a balanced approach to debt management.\n\nMarket Valuation:\n\nPrice to Earnings (P/E) Ratio: With a lower-than-average P/E ratio of 57.88 , the stock indicates an attractive valuation, potentially presenting a buying opportunity.\n\nPrice to Sales (P/S) Ratio: With a P/S ratio of 10.22 below industry standards, the stock shows potential undervaluation, making it an appealing investment option for those focusing on sales performance.\n\nEV/EBITDA Analysis (Enterprise Value to its Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization): With an EV/EBITDA ratio lower than industry benchmarks at 37.25, Intuit presents an attractive value opportunity.\n\nMarket Capitalization Analysis: The company's market capitalization surpasses industry averages, showcasing a dominant size relative to peers and suggesting a strong market position.\n\nNow trade stocks online commission free with Charles Schwab, a trusted and complete investment firm.\n\nThe Importance of Insider Transactions\n\nInsider transactions should be considered alongside other factors when making investment decisions, as they can offer important insights.\n\nConsidering the legal perspective, an \"insider\" is defined as any officer, director, or beneficial owner holding more than ten percent of a company's equity securities, according to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This includes executives in the c-suite and major hedge funds. These insiders are mandated to disclose their transactions through a Form 4 filing, to be submitted within two business days of the transaction.\n\nPointing towards optimism, a company insider's new purchase signals their positive anticipation for the stock to rise.\n\nNevertheless, insider sells may not necessarily indicate a bearish view and can be influenced by various factors.\n\nUnderstanding Crucial Transaction Codes\n\nTaking a closer look at transactions, investors often prioritize those unfolding in the open market, meticulously cataloged in Table I of the Form 4 filing. A P in Box 3 denotes a purchase, while S signifies a sale. Transaction code C denotes the conversion of an option, and transaction code A signifies a grant, award, or other acquisition of securities from the company.\n\nCheck Out The Full List Of Intuit's Insider Trades.\n\nInsider Buying Alert: Profit from C-Suite Moves\n\nBenzinga Edge reveals every insider trade in real-time.

This achievement guarantees home court advantage throughout the playoffs and provides a strategic edge, as the schedule can be managed with a level of comfort that teams still fighting for positioning do not enjoy.\n\nEmbracing Unpredictability Over Reserved Strategies\n\nAt a recent practice session, the head coach shared insights into his approach for the postseason. He expressed the belief that the same benefits of unpredictability can be achieved by continuously presenting a variety of tactics rather than holding back for later stages. \u201cI am not a big saving guy. I think you can have the same effect by doing a lot of things and being unpredictable\u2026You can save something and it\u2019s unpredictable because no one\u2019s ever seen it before or you can do so many things that you become unpredictable. You don\u2019t know what card you are going to draw at a given time,\u201d he explained. His focus is on ensuring that the team is prepared for any scenario, favoring the development of multiple offensive and defensive options throughout the season.\n\nStrategic Depth and Future Opportunities\n\nThis method of cultivating a diverse and adaptive game plan has allowed the team to build confidence across numerous lineups. By continuously evolving their strategies rather than locking into a single approach, they aim to keep opponents guessing at every turn. Should an untried situation arise in the playoffs, it would be a result of the natural progression of opportunity or necessity rather than a deliberate withholding of tactics. This approach underlines a commitment to flexibility and a readiness to capitalize on every moment, setting a robust foundation for success in the postseason.",

            "content": "For years, Intuit QuickBooks has been the challenger in Australia in the cloud-based accounting and financial management software category. But when the incumbents get complacent, the challenger sees an opening -- and Intuit QuickBooks is seizing its moment. With Xero\u2019s recent price hikes sparking doubt among accountants, QuickBooks has one simple message: Take another look.\n\nThe challenge? Overcoming deeply entrenched perceptions. In-depth qualitative research with accountants around the country revealed that many of them had deep scepticism based on their limited experience with the product many years ago. Despite the hyperbolic, product-led jingles of the category, some accountants thought Intuit QuickBooks wasn\u2019t worth reconsidering.\n\nBut in reality, QuickBooks has evolved into an integrated suite of solutions that seamlessly manage workflows, automate tasks and empower collaboration -- all while giving accountants back their most precious asset -- time.\n\nTo spark a reappraisal, Intuit QuickBooks and creative innovation company R/GA Australia launched a bold campaign that does what most brands wouldn\u2019t dare: confront the negatives of the past head-on. The QuickBooks Re-Review leans into old perceptions, reviving past reviews -- only to dismantle them with undeniable proof. Intuit QuickBooks is now efficient, powerful, and built to make their lives easier.\n\nBut the QuickBooks Re-Review isn\u2019t just about revisiting old critiques; it\u2019s about shifting behaviour. Those taking a second look are switching to QuickBooks, creating a ripple effect that\u2019s encouraging others to follow suit and reconsider their views.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker \u2014 the numbers prove it. Now, more accountants than ever recognise Intuit QuickBooks as a real contender. Interviews with accountants revealed a saving of up to 30 hours a week using QuickBooks when one firm compared it to previous accounting software, another reporting year-end compliance that once took four hours now takes just four minutes.\n\n\"We approached this campaign from an accountant-first perspective, listening to their feedback on past inefficiencies and old reviews,\u201d said Kirsty Hollis, senior brand manager at Intuit QuickBooks.\n\n\u201cWith over 100 product and feature improvements and an influx of positive reviews today, we felt it was time to shift those long-held beliefs and invite accountants to take another look at QuickBooks.\"\n\nSeamus Higgins, chief creative officer at R/GA Australia added, \"If someone has had a negative perception of you for a long time, you can\u2019t expect to win them over by saying, \u201cHey, look at me, I\u2019m great now\u201d. Yes, you\u2019ve got to earn their attention. But more importantly, you\u2019ve got to earn their trust. I have huge respect for Intuit QuickBooks for being bold enough to go on that journey.\u201d\n\nWill Chapman, managing partner at Avenue C said, \u201cWe have the challenge of ensuring that our message is seen by accountants, but reaching them isn\u2019t enough without a bold, stand-out message. The QuickBooks Re-Review is exactly the brave approach we need to grab the attention of our core target and ensure that they give QuickBooks the second chance it deserves.\u201d\n\nThe campaign rolls out across multiple channels from March 17th.\n\n",

            "content": "Intuit QuickBooks has partnered with R/GA Australia to launch a new campaign that challenges outdated perceptions of its products. Titled 'QuickBooks Re-Review', the works seeks to address past negative reviews and demonstrate improvements in the software.\n\nIntuit QuickBooks has been a challenger in the Australian cloud-based accounting and financial management software market, competing against established players such as Xero. In response to recent price increases by Xero, QuickBooks' campaign is targeting accountants to reconsider their software choice.\n\nQualitative research conducted by Intuit QuickBooks indicated that many accountants held skepticism towards the software based on outdated experiences. The campaign highlights that QuickBooks has evolved into an integrated suite of solutions that automate tasks and enhance collaboration, aiming to save accountant's time.\n\nSenior Brand Manager at Intuit QuickBooks, Kirsty Hollis, stated, \"We approached this campaign from an accountant-first perspective, listening to their feedback on past inefficiencies and old reviews...With over 100 product and feature improvements and an influx of positive reviews today, we felt it was time to shift those long-held beliefs and invite accountants to take another look at QuickBooks.\"\n\nRolling out across multiple channels starting March 17, the campaign is designed to shift behaviour and encourage accountants to switch to QuickBooks, with some reporting significant time savings using the software.\n\nChief Creative Officer at R/GA Australia, Seamus Higgins, stated, \"If someone has had a negative perception of you for a long time, you can\u2019t expect to win them over by saying, 'Hey, look at me, I\u2019m great now'. Yes, you\u2019ve got to earn their attention. But more importantly, you\u2019ve got to earn their trust. I have huge respect for Intuit QuickBooks for being bold enough to go on that journey.\"\n\nManaging Partner at Avenue C, Will Chapman, said, \"We have the challenge of ensuring that our message is seen by accountants, but reaching them isn\u2019t enough without a bold, stand-out message. The QuickBooks Re-Review is exactly the brave approach we need to grab the attention of our core target and ensure that they give QuickBooks the second chance it deserves.\"",

The QuickBooks Accountant Re-Review leans into old perceptions with a light-hearted approach in a campaign that revives past reviews to dismantle them.\n\nFor years, Intuit QuickBooks has been the challenger in Australia in the cloud-based accounting and financial management software category. But when the incumbents get complacent, the challenger sees an opening says the campaign adding that with Xero\u2019s recent price hikes sparking doubt among accountants, QuickBooks has one simple message: Take another look.\n\nThe challenge? Overcoming deeply entrenched perceptions. In-depth qualitative research with accountants around the country revealed many of them had deep skepticism based on their limited experience of the product many years ago.\n\nAlthough some accountants thought Intuit QuickBooks wasn\u2019t worth reconsidering, QuickBooks has evolved into an integrated suite of solutions managing workflows, automating tasks, and empowering collaboration.\n\nNow, more accountants than ever recognize Intuit QuickBooks as a real contender. Interviews with accountants revealed a saving of up to 30 hours a week using QuickBooks when one firm compared it to previous accounting software, another reporting year-end compliance that once took four hours now takes just four minutes.\n\n\u201cWe approached this campaign from an accountant-first perspective, listening to their feedback on past inefficiencies and old reviews,\u201d said Kirsty Hollis, Senior Brand Manager at Intuit QuickBooks.\n\n\u201cWith over 100 product and feature improvements and an influx of positive reviews today, we felt it was time to shift those long-held beliefs and invite accountants to take another look at QuickBooks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf someone has had a negative perception of you for a long time, you can\u2019t expect to win them over by saying, \u201cHey, look at me, I\u2019m great now\u201d.

Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhy Does Intuit Spark Debate?\n\nCreated in 1983 when founder Scott Cook watched his wife struggle to reconcile the family's checkbook, Intuit provides tax and accounting software for small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nTwo Positive Attributes:\n\n1. Billings Growth Boosts Cash On Hand\n\nBillings is a non-GAAP metric that is often called \u201ccash revenue\u201d because it shows how much money the company has collected from customers in a certain period. This is different from revenue, which must be recognized in pieces over the length of a contract.\n\nIntuit\u2019s billings punched in at $4.10 billion in Q4, and over the last four quarters, its year-on-year growth averaged 15%. This performance was solid, indicating robust customer demand. The cash collected from customers also enhances liquidity and provides a solid foundation for future investments and growth.\n\n2. Customer Acquisition Costs Are Recovered in Record Time\n\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period represents the months required to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer. Essentially, it\u2019s the break-even point for sales and marketing investments. A shorter CAC payback period is ideal, as it implies better returns on investment and business scalability.\n\nIntuit is extremely efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 12.2 months this quarter. The company\u2019s rapid recovery of its customer acquisition costs indicates it has a highly differentiated product offering and a strong brand reputation due to its scale. These dynamics give Intuit more resources to pursue new product initiatives while maintaining the flexibility to increase its sales and marketing investments.\n\nOne Reason to be Careful:\n\nLong-Term Revenue Growth Disappoints\n\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last three years, Intuit grew its sales at a 14.6% compounded annual growth rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell short of our standards for the software sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds. Luckily, there are other things to like about Intuit.\n\nFinal Judgment\n\nIntuit\u2019s merits more than compensate for its flaws, but at $610.55 per share (or 8.8\u00d7 forward price-to-sales), is now the right time to buy the stock? See for yourself in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\n\nStocks We Like Even More Than Intuit\n\nWith rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.\n\nPut yourself in the driver\u2019s seat by checking out our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\n\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,183% between December 2019 and December 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like Sterling Infrastructure (+1,096% five-year return).

            "content": "Most readers would already be aware that Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) stock increased significantly by 6.8% over the past month. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuit is:\n\n17% = US$3.0b \u00f7 US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2025).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.17.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Intuit's Earnings Growth And 17% ROE\n\nTo start with, Intuit's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 15%. This certainly adds some context to Intuit's moderate 12% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Intuit's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 20% in the same period.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for INTU? You can find out in\n\nIs Intuit Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nIntuit has a three-year median payout ratio of 36%, which implies that it retains the remaining 64% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.\n\nMoreover, Intuit is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 20% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 28% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Intuit's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

From TurboTax, an Intuit product.\n\n\u201cI have since tried unsuccessfully to contact Intuit by phone,\u201d Jeanes said. \u201cI\u2019ve spent time for a couple days on their help line but have never been able to get to a live person and the automated stuff doesn\u2019t really pertain to my situation.\u201d\n\nHe also sent an email to customer service, but it told him to call the phone number he\u2019d already been trying.\n\nFed up, he asked Bamboozled for help.\n\nIt all started on Feb. 28 when he received two emails, one minute apart, from \u201cIntuit TurboTax Customer Service.\u201d\n\nBeing a reader of Bamboozled, Jeanes said, he was suspicious.\n\n\u201cI thought that it was a scam and that they were trying to get me to click on the link,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I hovered with the mouse over the link, it appeared that they really were going to Intuit.\u201d\n\nEach email said his order was successfully processed and his TurboTax download was now available. Each showed the $330.54 cost was charged to different credit cards.\n\nAnd both orders included two versions of \u201cTurboTax Desktop Home and Business\u201d at $120 a pop and one TurboTax Deluxe for $70. Six programs ordered in all.\n\n\u201cSince I had not had any contact with Intuit about acquiring TurboTax, I suspected some sort of fraud,\u201d he said. \u201cMy next step was an online check of both Visa accounts. Sure enough, both had charges by Intuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was surprised and annoyed,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s when he started contacting the company, but all of his efforts were unsuccessful.\n\nHe next disputed the charges with each of his credit cards. But the real mystery is how the charges happened, and how the use of two separate credit cards fit in.\n\nJeanes said he does use Quicken, which used to be owned by Intuit, but his records show he used a different credit card \u2014 a Discover card \u2014 for those purchases, including for an annual Quicken subscription.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m puzzled how Intuit would have all the information to charge these two credit cards and why, assuming it was some kind of mistake, that they would put the same charge on two different credit cards,\u201d the Lawrenceville man said.\n\nWe took his story to Intuit and asked if it could help.\n\nMORE: 400K N.J. retirees can now use this free tax return service\n\nMORE: Nearly 32K people in N.J. are owed $26.5M in tax refunds. Don\u2019t miss the deadline to get yours.\n\nMORE: You could lose this $100 property tax relief because of Stay NJ, ANCHOR changes\n\nA few days later, Jeanes got a call from the company. A representative called it all \u201cvery strange,\u201d Jeanes said, and he asked Jeanes to send copies of the email confirmations.\n\nJeanes sent them.\n\nHe got another call the next day.\n\nAn account was created in his name on Feb. 27, the day of the charges, but TurboTax had no record of Jeanes\u2019 email or credit card numbers, he said he was told.\n\n\u201cOur escalations team confirmed that the unauthorized purchases did not originate with TurboTax as our database does not have any prior information on Mr. Jeanes,\u201d a TurboTax spokeswoman said. \u201cThe unauthorized charges were made due to Mr. Jeanes credit cards being compromised.\u201d\n\nTurboTax closed the account and said it would not oppose the credit card disputes so the charges would be eliminated.\n\nJeanes said he isn\u2019t so sure the mystery is solved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m skeptical,\u201d Jeanes said. \u201cIf someone else actually had my credit card info, I think they would be charging big-ticket items like crazy until the card got cancelled. They wouldn\u2019t be messing around with a few hundred dollars for TurboTax.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad this episode seems to be concluding. It\u2019s been a big time drag,\u201d Jeanes said. \u201cI\u2019m very appreciative of Bamboozled\u2019s help in getting Intuit\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: this story has been updated to correct information about TurboTax\u2019s ownership.\n\nPlease subscribe now and support the local journalism YOU rely on and trust.",

( ) shareholders if they were a little worried about the fact that Eve Burton, the Independent Director recently netted about US$1.0m selling shares at an average price of US$600. That diminished their holding by a very significant 100%, which arguably implies a strong desire to reallocate capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntuit Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP and Chief People & Places Officer, Laura Fennell, sold US$5.1m worth of shares at a price of US$659 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$604. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).\n\nInsiders in Intuit didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\nI will like Intuit better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free\n\nDoes Intuit Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Intuit insiders own 2.3% of the company, currently worth about US$3.9b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Intuit Insiders?\n\nInsiders sold Intuit shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Intuit makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

At nearly every turn, former champ Edwards was stymied by Brady\u2019s elite grappling that gradually wore him down in the 4th, long enough for Philadelphia's finest to secure the guillotine choke. The welterweight title is on the line in May\u2019s UFC 315 when Muhammad takes on Jack Della Maddalena, and when it comes time to find an opponent for that winner, it\u2019s hard to imagine Brady won\u2019t be in that conversation.\n\nPerformance Of The Night: Shauna Bannon\n\nShauna Bannon scored her first UFC win at UFC 304 in 2024, and followed it up tonight in London with her first UFC finish. It didn\u2019t always look like a sure thing. Her game opponent, Puja Tomar, dropped her with a brutal head kick midway through the second round, but \u201cMama B\u201d kept her wits about her during the subsequent ground and pound and maneuvered off of her back to work into a beautiful armbar. It was a powerful display of patience and persistence.\n\nPerformance Of The Night: Kevin Holland\n\nThe diverse styles of Kevin Holland and Gunnar Nelson provided a high-level MMA chess match on the main card, with the prolific \u201cTrailblazer\u201d getting the nod from the judges. He might have gotten a TKO victory if the first round had been two seconds longer, but his superb takedown defense and unorthodox striking was enough to survive a trademark grappling clinic from Iceland\u2019s Nelson.\n\nPerformance Of The Night: Alexia Thainara\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to come into enemy territory and beat a local favorite, but Alexia Thainara sure made it look easy with a first round submission of Molly McCann. From her extended walkout to her victory bellyflop, the Brazilian was a fireball of smiles, dancing, high energy and good vibes made all the more impressive by the fact she took the fight\u2014her UFC debut\u2014on just a few days\u2019 notice.\n\nAttendance: 18,583 (Sold Out)\n\nGate: $4,711,410\n\nRecords: Highest Grossing Fight Night In UFC History",

            "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on Intuit Inc. (INTU) on Twitter by TMTMoats. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on INTU. Intuit Inc. (INTU)'s share was trading at $603.11 as of March 19th. INTU\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 56.42 and 32.47 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nIs Intuit Inc. (INTU) Best Software Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?\n\nA professional tax preparer, using a laptop to complete an income tax return.\n\nIntuit (INTU) has faced underperformance since late last year, but the upcoming tax season presents a catalyst for a rebound. TurboTax, the company\u2019s leading consumer segment, is expected to drive strong Q3 results, benefiting from an increase in complex tax filings. Analysts project $4 billion in consumer revenue, reflecting 8% year-over-year growth, as more taxpayers turn to Intuit for sophisticated tax solutions. This shift toward complex filings boosts average selling prices, contributing to overall revenue expansion.\n\nBeyond tax season, Intuit\u2019s Global Business Solutions (GBS) segment is fueling long-term growth. GBS is forecasted to generate approximately $11 billion in revenue, growing at 16% annually due to its expansion into midsize businesses and rising revenue per customer. This segment has become a critical driver of Intuit\u2019s broader ecosystem, positioning the company for sustained double-digit growth. Additionally, the company\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) are projected to rise by 14%, reaching $19.38, supported by ongoing share buybacks and potential margin expansion.\n\nDespite its recent pullback, Intuit\u2019s valuation has become attractive. The stock currently trades at 28 times earnings, below its historical peak of 35 times and cheaper than the average software ETF valuation of 32 times. This discount, combined with its growth drivers and strong fundamentals, presents a compelling entry point for long-term investors. With tax season set to boost near-term results and GBS driving sustained expansion, Intuit offers an appealing investment opportunity at current levels.\n\nIntuit Inc. (INTU) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 89 hedge fund portfolios held INTU at the end of the fourth quarter which was 87 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of INTU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than INTU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

Clippers' spiffy new home in Inglewood has the bells and whistles befitting a $2 billion venue \u2014 from boasting five basketball courts to the most leg room of any arena in the NBA to a promise of a frictionless experience at the parking lots and concessions.\n\nBut the Intuit Dome promises to offer something no other venue in the state allows \u2014 the ability to serve alcohol in VIP suites until 4 a.m., thanks to a bill that Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk has signed into law.\n\nAB 3206 would \"authorize alcoholic beverage sales to occur between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. upon the on-sale licensed premises operated in a fully enclosed arena with a seating capacity of at least 18,000 seats located in the City of Inglewood if specified conditions are met,\" according to the bill's language, which matches the description of the Intuit Dome.\n\n\"Instead of authorizing an entire city or jurisdiction to allow after our alcohol sales, we're taking a venue-by-venue approach,\" said Terry Schanz, chief of staff to Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, who authored the bill.\n\nA handful of legislative efforts have failed to expand last call in the state, including one in 2022 to allow cities like West Hollywood to serve alcohol past 2 a.m.\n\nSchanz said those failed attempts have prompted the \"new approach\" in this proposal.\n\n\n\nConcerns are raised\n\nThe exclusivity of this exception had raised concerns.\n\n\"If you have an institution that's open that late, that means added burden, for example, on law enforcement or other local businesses, whether they be gas stations or otherwise,\" said Laurie Levenson, a professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School and a former federal prosecutor.\n\n\"I can see that this was probably done to boost the new stadium,\" Levenson added. But, \"the benefits have to be to the whole community, not just to particular individuals, or that really will bring on scrutiny.\"\n\n\"Questions like, why are they making this exception? Do they really need to make this exception? What is the problem you're trying to solve with this bill? And what are the problems you might be causing with this bill?\" Levenson said.\n\n\n\nBuilt-in guardrails\n\nSchanz said the bill includes a number of measures \u2014 like including a sunset on the bill for future legislative review, a limit on the size of the area to 2,500 square feet where last-call would be extended, and and a cap on the number of patrons to 100 people.\n\n\"A lot of these guardrails are intended to make sure that we are protecting the public health and safety \u2014 not just of the patrons of the venue, but also of the surrounding community,\" Schanz said.\n\nIn addition, he said the Inglewood City Council will need to approve the provision every year until 2030, its built-in sunset date.\n\n\"I don't see that as causing any kind of public safety or public policy concerns,\" Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts said. \"The reality is you're inside of an arena that has its own security in a private club area, with patrons that can afford to pay for very expensive suites. This is not an area of general public congregation.\"\n\nButts added that the 4 a.m. cutoff would only happen on event and game nights, which he calculated to be about 70 days out of the year.\n\n\"AB 3206 complements the over $2 billion of private investment that has been made through the construction of the recently opened Intuit Dome, it's another signal of Inglewood's renaissance that's underway,\" Schanz said.\n\n",

            "content": "Intuit (INTU) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software have returned +3.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -7.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Intuit belongs, has lost 7.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Intuit is expected to post earnings of $11.01 per share, indicating a change of +11.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.32 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14.1%. This estimate has changed +0.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.02 indicates a change of +14% from what Intuit is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Intuit.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Intuit, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.56 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +12.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $18.3 billion and $20.52 billion estimates indicate +12.4% and +12.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIntuit reported revenues of $3.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17%. EPS of $3.32 for the same period compares with $2.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.67%. The EPS surprise was +28.68%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIntuit is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuit. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\n\nIt's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\n\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

TurboTax, a partner of March Madness, released the commercial during the first full day of March Madness.\n\nThe commercial was filmed inside Rupp Arena, and featured the two Kentucky stars in their UK uniforms. It aimed at describing how Intuit TurboTax makes doing taxes easier. They did this by comparing doing taxes before Intuit TurboTax to shooting onea 20-foot rim with a rock. \u201cWhat?\u201d Strack said in the video.\n\nBrea revealed the video on social media with the following message: \u201cTaxes are tough no more. Now taxes are as easy as matching with a @turbotax Expert today so you can watch more basketball this March Madness!\u201d\n\nTaxes are tough no more \u274c Now taxes are as easy as matching with a @turbotax Expert today so you can watch more basketball this March Madness! #TurboTaxPartner #MarchMadness #ad pic.twitter.com/TDdW8eDG3B \u2014 Koby Brea (@kobybrea) March 20, 2025\n\nBoth Brea and Strack are gearing up, and play major roles for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams in Lexington. For Brea, Kentucky relies on him for his 3-point shooting. For Strack, she\u2019s 6 foot 5 and commands the paints for the Wildcats, nearly averaging a double-double this year.\n\nIntuit TurboTax also released individual promotions for both Brea and Strack. Those videos can be seen on their personal social media pages.\n\nAccording to KSR\u2019s Zach Geoghegan, he\u2019s far from the only Kentucky star to showcase his NIL partnerships this week. Brea\u2019s teammate, Lamont Butler, recently colaborated with the popular footwear brand Crocs. Andrew Carr has been busy as well, linking deals with the likes of Celsius, Stanley and Logan\u2019s of Lexington. Butler, Carr and Jaxson Robinson also star in a fan-favorite local commercial for Clark\u2019s Pump-N-Shop.\n\nStrack\u2019s teammate, Cassidy Rowe, also has a deal in place with Clark\u2019s Pump-N-Shop. Teonni Key recently showcased her recent deal with Hollister as well.\n\nAs both teams gear up for their NCAA Tournament openers this weekend, the men\u2019s team is headed to Milwaukee to take on the Troy Trojans, who won the Sun Belt Conference tournament earlier this month. Meanwhile, the women\u2019s basketball team is set to host Liberty, the Conference USA tournament champions, at home in Lexington.\n\nThe men\u2019s team will be looking to avoid a first-round upset for the third time in four years, while the women\u2019s team is making their first tournament since 2022. In recent years, neither Kentucky team has had much luck in March Madness, as the men\u2019s squad haven\u2019t made it through the second weekend since 2019, and 2016 on the women\u2019s side of things.",

            "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Intuit (INTU) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nIntuit currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.50, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 30 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.50 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 30 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 76.7% and 3.3% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for INTU\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Intuit here>>>\n\n\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Intuit, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs INTU a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Intuit, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.7% over the past month to $19.32.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Intuit. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Intuit may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys.

The sellers are not oblivious to history, even with the White House is as they see Trump mimicking legendary president Herbert Hoover, who, despite endless diatribes by economists saying Smoot-Hawley could destroy the economy, championed and signed the bill in the name of \u2014 yes \u2014 the Working Man, especially the farmers. Exports dropped 60%, and we went into the worst depression in our nation\u2019s history. Hoover regretted it, saying that they should be repealed in 1932 \u2014 way too late.

(NASDAQ:INTU) stands against the other best fintech stocks.\n\nTech stocks have faced challenges lately, and fintech companies have been hit particularly hard. On March 10, CNBC reported that the Nasdaq experienced its biggest drop since 2022 with financial technology companies being some of the biggest losers. These companies included stock trading apps and cryptocurrency exchanges, which suffered due to a drop in Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin declined by nearly 5%, continuing a downward trend. The leading cryptocurrency has fallen 19% over the past month.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Cheap Technology Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Worst Performing Crypto Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nBeyond crypto, other fintech sectors like online lenders and payments companies also suffered. These companies also declined more than the broader market.\n\nFintech analysts point to declining consumer confidence as a potential challenge, especially for companies that rely on consumer spending. In February, the Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index fell to 98.3, falling by nearly 7%. This decline marked the largest monthly drop since August 2021. According to CNBC, analysts noted that while fintech companies had performed relatively well since the election, sentiment has recently turned sour due to declining consumer confidence and signs of slowing discretionary spending.\n\nThe current fintech sell-off came after a strong rally in the fourth quarter of 2024, which was driven by expectations of Fed rate cuts and hopes for a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration.\n\nDespite a challenging time, fintech companies continue to invest in new technologies. This is leading to significant innovation and disruption in financial services. Additionally, recent declines could present a buying opportunity as certain fintech companies are setting themselves to perform well in the future.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 20 best fintech stocks to buy according to billionaires, we looked for the biggest fintech companies. We reviewed our own rankings, financial media reports, ETFs, and various online resources to compile a list of the best fintech stocks. Next, we focused on the top 20 fintech stocks most favored by billionaires. Data for the number of billionaire investors for each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database. Finally, the 20 best fintech stocks to buy were ranked in ascending order based on the number of billionaires holding stakes in them as of Q4 2024.\n\nAdditionally, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of more than 1,000 elite hedge funds.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIntuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 15\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 89\n\nIntuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is an American multinational business software company that is primarily focused on financial technology and software. The company offers a range of products and services such as TurboTax for tax preparation, QuickBooks for small business accounting, Credit Karma for credit monitoring and personal finance, and Mailchimp for email marketing. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is one of the best fintech stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nOn February 26, BMO Capital analyst Daniel Jester set a price target of $714 for Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating based on a combination of factors that highlight INTU\u2019s strong performance and promising growth prospects. The company\u2019s Q2 fiscal 2025 results were solid, with notable growth in QuickBooks Online (QBO) and Credit Karma. This helped Intuit Inc. (INTU) drive a 14% increase in EPS for the first half of fiscal 2025. Jester highlighted the company\u2019s effective execution in the tax segment as a key short-term catalyst, while AI investments and the middle-market QuickBooks segment offer medium-term opportunities to support sustained growth. Despite challenges in Mailchimp\u2019s target market, QuickBooks Online revenue grew significantly. The consumer segment shows promise with a positive start to the tax season, with robust growth in Credit Karma expected to boost TurboTax adoption. Additionally, investments in AI continue to improve efficiency and margins. This presents modest upside potential for Intuit Inc.\n\nOverall, INTU ranks 9th on our list of the best fintech stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of INTU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than INTU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The company recently reported that it has 5.03 million shares sold short, which is 1.84% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 1.95 days to cover their short positions on average.\n\nWhy Short Interest Matters\n\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\n\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\n\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\n\nIntuit Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Intuit has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.\n\nComparing Intuit's Short Interest Against Its Peers\n\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, Intuit's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 2.98%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\n\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock?

            "content": "Recent performance in the global software industry has been marked by volatility. Jason Hunter, JP Morgan\u2019s Head of Technical Strategy, shared insights in a January interview with CNBC, highlighting trends in the software and semiconductor sectors. He noted that while semiconductor stocks led market growth in 2024, the software sector gained momentum later in the year but underperformed in December. This pullback brought the valuation ratios of both large- and small-cap software stocks back to their breakout levels relative to semiconductors, offering a more favourable risk-reward scenario for software investments.\n\nThe Morningstar strategist further emphasized that despite short-term fluctuations, the long-term demand for software remains strong, particularly in database software and customer experience applications, which are expected to grow at the fastest rate. Software companies gain an advantage from substantial upfront investments in R&D and customer acquisition, which lead to long-lasting, high-value client relationships. Compton also underlined the fact that most firms in the sector possess strong competitive advantages, or \u201cmoats,\u201d primarily due to switching costs and network effects. Once a company adopts a software solution, shifting to a competitor is complex, ensuring a stable revenue stream. Although IT spending has normalized following the pandemic, ongoing automation, AI-driven advancements, and customer-oriented software solutions are expected to fuel sustained growth in the sector.\n\nEric Compton, an equities strategist for Morningstar Research Services, underscored artificial intelligence and digital transformation as major drivers for growth in his Industry Outlook published on March 11. He projected consistent revenue and margin growth for the software sector, with total industry revenue anticipated to rise at an annual rate of 11% through 2029. Key factors supporting this growth include high customer retention due to switching costs, significant initial investments that translate into steady revenue streams, and sustained demand for digital transformation. Compton also identified AI adoption, increasing data requirements, and the shift to cloud-based solutions as central drivers for growth, while cautioning against potential challenges like higher interest rates, economic uncertainties, and regulatory issues.\n\nThe software industry has firmly established itself as one of the most resilient and fastest-growing sectors in the global economy. As digital transformation continues to expand across various industries, businesses are increasingly relying on software solutions to enhance efficiency, support seamless growth, and foster innovation. The rising focus on automating workflows, improving customer experiences, and leveraging data-driven insights has sustained the high demand for software products.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Software Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stands against other best software stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn conclusion, despite recent volatility and macroeconomic risks, the software sector remains an attractive space for investors due to its promising long-term outlook. Ongoing investments in cloud technology, AI, and digital transformation are expected to drive growth, with segments like database software, customer experience tools, and cybersecurity anticipated to expand at a faster pace. Companies that adapt to emerging technological trends, maintain strong customer retention, and use AI to drive innovation are likely to achieve the greatest success in the future.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine the 10 best software stocks to buy according to billionaires, we shortlisted the top 10 enterprise and application software stocks most favoured by billionaire investors, leveraging Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database on billionaire holdings. We then arranged the shortlisted stocks in ascending order based on the number of billionaire investors holding stakes in each company as of Q4 2024. Additionally, we provided insights into hedge fund sentiment surrounding these stocks, using data from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of hedge funds.\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of market close on March 14.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Intuit Inc. (INTU) Best Software Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?\n\nA professional tax preparer, using a laptop to complete an income tax return.\n\nIntuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 15\n\nBillionaire Holdings: $6.8 Billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 89\n\nIntuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is a leader in financial software solutions, catering to individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses to help them manage their finances effectively. Its renowned products include TurboTax for tax filing, QuickBooks for accounting, and Credit Karma for credit monitoring. Additionally, Intuit is the owner of Mailchimp, a prominent email marketing platform.\n\nAccording to its annual stockholder presentation, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) estimates that it has currently captured only 5% of its total addressable market, which is projected to expand to an impressive $326 billion. This growth potential is driven by core business expansion, ecosystem enhancements, and international market penetration. Looking ahead, the company recently confirmed its FY 2025 guidance, forecasting total revenue growth of 12%-13% and adjusted EPS growth of 13%-14%.\n\nOn March 7, Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, highlighting multiple positive factors. Chief among them were the consistent improvements in IRS tax-filing data and the anticipated benefits from late-season filings. The analyst further emphasized that the conclusion of TurboTax\u2019s early-bird pricing is expected to increase the proportion of filings at higher average selling prices, boosting revenue. Moreover, the expanding adoption of TurboTax Live Full Service was identified as a crucial growth driver for Intuit in fiscal year 2025.\n\nOverall, INTU ranks 9th on our list of best software stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of INTU to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than INTU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires",

The Dome is also designed to be carbon neutral, equipped with solar panels, low-flow faucets for water preservation and drought-tolerant landscaping.\n\nIn January, the Dome hosted the FireAid benefit concert, estimated to have raised more than $100 million to support recovery and rebuilding after the devastating Los Angeles wildfires.\n\nWhile technology prevails at the Dome, the newly transformed $75 million wing of the Natural History Museum brings the outdoors in, with \"a gleaming glass fa\u00e7ade that opens up the museum to the surrounding Exposition Park,\" TIME wrote.\n\nThe museum calls the new wing, NHM Commons, the intersection of science, nature, and culture with a gathering place that includes a courtyard, amphitheater, and garden.\n\nA 75-foot-long green-boned dinosaur, named Gnatalie, winds along the wall, greeting guests as they enter the wing. The museum says it is the most complete sauropod skeletal mount on the West Coast\u2014and the only green-colored fossil specimen on the planet.\n\nCultural exhibits are also on display, including Barbara Carrasco's landmark and once-controversial 80-foot mural, \"L.A.

Bilge, Neyo, and Mario got \u201ccrunk\" before a sold out crowd at the newly built Intuit Dome in Inglewood, CA. Several musical talents performed before the Queen of hip-hop-soul graced the stage. As Mary's catalogue consists of many memorable hits, it was hard to choose which one stood out the most.\n\nI remember the 1994 hit song \"All I Need,\" which featured rapper Method Man from the Wu Tang Clan. The popularity of the song skyrocketed on the billboard charts and saw MTV, VH1, and BET playing it constantly on the radio and television. The blend of R&B and hip-hop creates a unique sound of soulful/street-edge music. Hailing from the Bronx, NY, Mary\u2019s musical production captures the sounds of familiar, throwback R&B songs while also adding a classical, reggae, and hip-hop feel.\n\nBoth Mario and Ne-Yo set the tone with performances that reminded the crowd why they remain on everyone's R&B playlists. Both artists have a stage presence that radiates amongst concert goers\u2014fans basically trampled over each other just to get to the front of the stage.\n\nMario's performance was a perfect mix of nostalgia and new-wave. Performing classics like \"Let Me Love You\" and \"Main One\" as well as a few tracks from his latest album. Mario had all the women screaming for more, giving the crowd a sultry and sexy performance. He ran onstage with so much hype and enthusiasm that you could hear the roar in fans' voices. Many in the crowd dressed in '90s attire, channeling their nostalgia for the event.\n\nNext up was Ne-Yo, performing hit songs such as \"Closer\" and \"Miss Independent.\" He definitely left an impression on his female fans\u2014holding the audience's energy at an all-time high. Ne-Yo's talent for stage presence extends far beyond just his solo and acting career. Songs like \"Because of You\" and \"Mad\" may give the impression of a sly and slick individual, but they also indicate his inherent hopeless-romantic nature. Ne-Yo is, without a doubt, a talented entertainer in his own right.\n\nReturning to Mary J. Blige\u2014the nine-time Grammy winner gave many shoutouts to people who helped her in the music industry, as well as those who made her feel welcome when she first came to Los Angeles. She had a contagious carefree attitude; it is evident that she lives for performing. Mary definitely gave the crowd what they were asking for with songs such as \"Family affair\" and \"Real Love\"\u2014her stage presence left a lasting impression and her positive vibes reminded me to just focus on having a good time.\n\nPhotos by Daniel Seyum",

Despite the name, the completely free version of this tax prep software is only available to filers with an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $48,000 or less or active duty military with an AGI of $84,000 or less.\n\nFor everyone else, the federal return is free, but you'll pay $14.99 per state. There are a few upgrades and add-ons that can raise the price further, but none of those are tied to your tax situation \u2013 and that\u2019s why it\u2019s at the top of the list.\n\nSay you\u2019re a self-employed filer or you plan to itemize your taxes, for example. Most tax prep software would force you into a deluxe or premium version to access the forms for those situations. At FreeTaxUSA, the price is the same regardless of which forms you need to submit.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not quite as seamless an experience as TurboTax and doesn\u2019t offer the full service options of H&R Block, it\u2019s a simple enough tax prep software at a flat price that works for most tax situations. You\u2019ll be able to import W2s and prior-year tax returns from competitor sites. The rest of the process is fairly straightforward.\n\nIf you do decide you want the help of a tax pro, you can add Deluxe Support for just $7.99. This allows you to ask your questions to a tax specialist via live chat as needed. For even more hands-on help, you can add Pro Support for $49.99. With this one, you can talk to an expert via live chat or phone and even share your screen with them so they can see exactly where you\u2019re stuck and walk you through the process.\n\nIn short, FreeTaxUSA may not actually be free for most, but it\u2019s a low-cost option that won\u2019t increase in price just because your taxes involve more than a W2. And if you do decide you need a little more guidance than the relatively basic software offers, you can add in expert support for as little as $7.99.\n\nBest tax prep software overall $14.99 at FreeTaxUSA Pay just $14.99 total to file your federal and state tax return \u2013 no matter what your tax situation is.\n\nEasiest DIY tax filing: Intuit TurboTax\n\n(Image credit: Intuit TurboTax)\n\nIf you want to file taxes yourself, but also want to take as much of the guesswork out of the process as possible, TurboTax makes it easy. TurboTax is continuously upgrading their online tax prep software, most recently by building integrations with QuickBooks and Credit Karma. This makes the process of uploading documents and forms to TurboTax as painless as possible.\n\nInstead of manually inputting information or answering questions, you can just link TurboTax to QuickBooks or your bank to import forms or even take a photo of your W2 and the software auto-fills your return with that information for you.\n\nOnce TurboTax has auto-filled as much of your return as it can, you\u2019ll be guided through the rest of your return in a step-by-step process that\u2019s easy to follow.\n\nThe tradeoff for that seamless process is price. While a free version is available, only those with the simplest tax situations are eligible and it excludes some of the cooler features that make TurboTax so easy to use.\n\nTo get the full experience, you\u2019ll need to spring for TurboTax Deluxe or Premium. The one you choose depends on your tax situation. Here\u2019s a quick comparison of pricing. Tap through the links to see which tax forms and tax situations are supported by each product.\n\nEasiest DIY tax filing Intuit TurboTax: at TurboTax Enjoy a seamless tax filing experience with TurboTax's easy document importing and user-friendly software.\n\nBest for complicated tax situations: H&R Block\n\n(Image credit: H&R Block)\n\nDid you retire abroad and now have no clue where to start with taxes? Are you a freelancer whose earned income in multiple states? Is this your first year filing taxes after divorce? For those extra tricky tax situations, it helps to have access to pros who study tax codes full time. H&R Block is your best bet if you know you\u2019ll need some professional advice and guidance as you navigate complicated tax situations.\n\nWhile other tax prep software offer customer support and some even offer a few ways to connect with a live tax professional, H&R Block stands out as one of the most flexible options if you want extra help.\n\nFor example, if you want to handle the process yourself and just have access to a pro, H&R Block Deluxe, Premium and Self-Employed products all include unlimited expert help to ask questions whenever you need it.\n\nYou also have the option to pay extra for an expert review before you file, if you\u2019d feel better having a professional check your work before you send your tax return to the IRS.\n\nIf you\u2019d rather just hand all your paperwork over to a pro and let them figure it out, you can do that, too. H&R Block offers in-person tax prep services as well as remote or drop-off options so you can work with a professional no matter where you are or how little time you have.\n\nThe more support you want, the more you\u2019ll pay. But if you\u2019ve got a tricky tax situation \u2013 especially one that most other tax prep software won\u2019t even touch \u2013 H&R Block is a great choice.\n\nBest for complicated tax situations at H&R Block A free version of H&R Block is available for simple taxes. But the best value is found in the deluxe, premium or full service options.\n\nMost affordable pro support: Jackson Hewitt\n\n(Image credit: Jackson Hewitt)\n\nFor a full service experience similar to H&R Block but at a lower price point, try Jackson Hewitt. You can get in-person help at your nearest Jackson Hewitt or participating Walmart location. You can also just gather all your paperwork and drop it off at one of these locations to let a pro do your taxes for you.\n\nPrices range from just $49 to $149 for these full service options, depending on the complexity of your taxes. Meanwhile, H&R Block\u2019s full service options start at $89 and go up from there depending on which forms you need to file.\n\nWith that said, you won\u2019t have the option to work with a tax pro remotely like you can at H&R Block. You also don\u2019t get the option to complete the return yourself and just have a tax pro review it before filing.\n\nJackson Hewitt also has online tax prep software if you want to do it yourself. The best thing about it is that you pay a flat $25 fee for access to the full software, including filing your federal and state returns. There\u2019s no hidden fees and no upselling prompts as you work through your taxes.\n\nThe downside: there\u2019s no free version at all. There are also a few forms not supported in the online tax filing platform that you can find in H&R Block\u2019s tax prep software. Though, for most filers, the online software is comprehensive enough. But if you know your tax situation is complicated, check through the list of Jackson Hewitt\u2019s supported forms to make sure everything you have is included before you start working through their online filing option.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Jackson Hewitt Prices at a Glance Online Tax Filing $25 (federal and state) File with a tax pro $49 to $149 (depending on forms needed)\n\nMost affordable pro support $25 at jacksonhewitt.com Pay a flat $25 fee for the online software or take advantage of low-cost full service tax preparation at thousands of Jackson Hewitt locations nationwide.\n\nTruly free tax prep software: Cash App Taxes\n\n(Image credit: Cash App)\n\nCash App Taxes stands out as one of the few ways to file taxes for free that is actually free for anyone with any tax situation. With most tax prep software, you can start filing for free. But if you have investment income to add or you\u2019d like to itemize your deductions, you suddenly find yourself shunted to a paid version.\n\nBasically, if you\u2019re doing anything more complicated than inputting a W2 form and claiming the standard deduction, that free tax prep software is no longer free.\n\nWith Cash App Taxes, there is no paid version. There are no add-ons or upgrades. It\u2019s free from start to finish, no matter which tax forms you need to file \u2013 and that\u2019s true for both your federal and state tax returns.\n\nWhat\u2019s the catch? There are two. First, your support options are limited and many of the forms need to be filled out manually. So if your taxes are complex, you need to be confident in your ability to manually fill out the forms on your own.\n\nThe second issue is that there are a few tax forms that Cash App just doesn\u2019t support. While most filers are probably covered, some of the trickier situations might not be. You can find a full list of excluded forms on their website. The most glaring omissions include: no multi-state filing, no foreign earned income and no underpayment penalty calculations.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Cash App Taxes Prices at a Glance Online Tax Filing Free\n\nTruly free tax prep software at Cash App & Cash App Taxes Enjoy free tax filing for just about every situation with Cash App Tax.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nThe five options listed above offer a great balance of cost and support features. But these competitors listed below are also worth considering if you're still undecided.\n\nEasy DIY software that's cheaper than TurboTax : TaxAct\n\n: TaxAct Premium features at a lower price: eFile\n\neFile Complex tax situations are free (if you\u2019re eligible) : 1040.com\n\n: 1040.com Simplified online tax filing: TaxSlayer\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWhile tax prep software can be a lifesaver that helps you avoid making mistakes on your tax return, figuring out the best balance of price and features for your situation is almost as complicated as filing your taxes.\n\nFortunately, you generally don't have to pay until you file. So, if you're still not sure which one to choose, you can start the process in a couple different platforms, decide which one you like more and finish the rest of your return with that one.",

            "content": "Ohio State student athletes get help from TurboTax navigating NIL deals during tax season\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Ohio State's Gene Smith talks CFP, future of college football and more Retiring Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith talks CFP, NIL, the future of college football and more in this April 18, 2024 press conference.\n\nOhio State student athletes are receiving tax support sessions from Intuit TurboTax to help them navigate the complexities of NIL deals.\n\nThe workshops cover topics such as taxable income, deductions, and the importance of understanding contracts.\n\nThe goal is to equip student athletes with the financial literacy skills necessary to manage their earnings and avoid potential tax issues.\n\nWhen Emma Hellenkamp hears the word \"taxes,\" the first thing that comes to mind is feeling overwhelmed.\n\nHellenkamp \u2014 an Ohio State sophomore and member of the university's dance team \u2014 gets plenty of brand deals as a student athlete. She's worked with Hollister showing off game day looks to her more than 60,000 Instagram followers. She's promoted SportsEngine Motion, a business platform for coaches and studios. She even has her own branded Ohio State gear available through The NIL Store.\n\nIt's exciting being able to build her platform while she's still a student athlete, Hellenkamp said. But earning money through name, image and likeness deals has it's own set of challenges, especially as the landscape around paying NCAA athletes continues to change.\n\n\"It's a whole new world,\" Hellenkamp said. \"Now as I'm making money, taxes are always on my mind.\"\n\nStudy up on education news: Subscribe to The Dispatch's weekly education newsletter Extra Credit\n\nIt's one reason that Hellenkamp and a few dozen other Ohio State student athletes recently attended tax support sessions offered by Intuit TurboTax on campus.\n\nTurboTax started offering workshops for student athletes two years ago, as NIL deals became more broadly available to student athletes nationwide and collectives started doling out money, said Caitlin Campbell, a TurboTax spokesperson who hosted the event.\n\n\"When it comes to taxes, it's complicated,\" Campbell said. \"We so often hear, 'I'm terrified,' 'I don't know where to start,' 'I don't want to get in trouble.'\"\n\nOhio State was one of 10 schools TurboTax experts visited this spring. Athletes from OSU's men's gymnastics, cheer, dance, fencing, tennis, women's rowing and artistic gymnastics teams took part in the workshops, though any athlete was welcome to attend, Campbell said.\n\nBrooke Shields \u2014 NIL program coordinator at OSU's Department of Athletics \u2014 said at least one athlete from each of Ohio State's 36 sports has an NIL deal. With more than 1,100 student athletes universitywide, Shields said its important for all athletes to have access to these workshops.\n\n\"Education is a pillar of everything we do,\" said Logan Hittle, Ohio State's associate athletic director of NIL & Strategic Initiatives. \"NIL is an extension of life skills.\"\n\nHittle said the university previously partnered with local banks to give presentations on credit, savings accounts and tax preparation. When TurboTax reached out two year ago, the company's interactive approach to helping student athletes seems like a good fit.\n\nAlthough many athletes are taking part in NIL deals, Hittle said students have a range of needs when it comes to financial literacy. Some students are asking how to apply for their first credit card. Others want to learn more about opening up an LLC.\n\n\"For some of our athletes, they're earning income sometimes for the first time ever,\" he said. \"It's about meeting student athletes where they're at.\"\n\nInside a conference room at the Fawcett Center, about two dozen student athletes gathered for a TurboTax workshop earlier this month. Most of the participants at this particular session were from the fencing and dance teams.\n\nKatharina Reekmans, an enrolled agent and TurboTax expert who specializes in influencer and NIL deals, asked attendees to pull out their phones and log into a online quiz game.\n\n\"It's not a sport unless you're competing,\" Reekmans joked.\n\nParticipants answered a series of tax questions like \"How much is the standard deduction?\" (Answer: $14,600 in 2024) and \"Which form do most individuals use to file their federal income tax returns?\" (Answer: 1040, though no one correctly answered this one.)\n\nAll student athletes earning money from NIL deals get 1099s, Hittle said, so they have to hold back a portion of their gross earnings for taxes each year. Reeksman talked some about that during the workshop. She pressed students to know their contracts and what is considered taxable income.\n\nShe shared an example she's heard from far too many student athletes: A company sends an athlete a package of, say, sneakers to use in some videos. The athlete believes the shoes are a gift, but they get a tax bill at the end of the year from the company charging them for the fair-market value of the shoes.\n\nReeksman said it's important for student athletes to know up-front as they are negotiating their contracts: Are you giving me these items as a PR package or as income? Are you going to withhold taxes for me or will I need to?\n\n\"Always assume that nothing is free,\" Reekmans said.\n\nReekmans also went over topics like tax credit, tax refunds and business expenses. For instance, student athletes can typically deduct travel expenses for NIL deals but cannot expense things like haircuts and manicures.\n\nRegardless of their sport, Reekmans told all of the student athletes that everyone can benefit from NIL.\n\n\"You're in non-traditional sports, but don't let that discourage you,\" she said. \"You're a big fish in a small pond. Capitalize on all the income you can make now.\"\n\nHellenkamp certainly resonated with that. Dance, she said, might be a niche college sport, but it has a big social platform. As she's getting more brand deals, Hellenkamp said she's grateful for the tax and financial literacy tools Ohio State offers its student athletes.\n\n\"I'm 19, I try to be aware, but I want to use my resources,\" she said. \"I need to get this education now.\"\n\nSheridan Hendrix is a higher education reporter for The Columbus Dispatch.

            "content": "Small businesses and accountants drive economic growth in the UK. But they aren\u2019t always given a seat at the policymaking table. Intuit is helping to change that.\n\nSmall and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) power the UK economy, representing over 99% of all businesses. It\u2019s clear their economic impact is anything but small. They are the innovators, the local employers, and the cornerstones of communities across the nation. Yet, they often face many challenges to success and often aren\u2019t included in policy discussions.\n\nThey need champions to help them power prosperity. As a company, Intuit is committed to helping our small business customers beat the odds and to making sure their voices are included at the policymaking table.\n\nGiving small businesses a voice at the policy table\n\nThe UK Department of Business and Trade (DBT) will publish their Small Business Strategy later this year and, alongside it, launch the new Business Growth Service in service of the Government\u2019s plan to grow and support small- and medium-sized businesses. To help inform these initiatives, DBT recently hosted a flagship three-day Small Business Policy Conference at Wilton Park, to hear directly from industry and small businesses about the challenges and opportunities they face. The Secretary of State for Business and Trade, The Rt Hon Jonathan Reynolds MP, and the Minister for Small Business, Gareth Thomas MP, also participated in these vital discussions.\n\nIntuit was proud to be one of just two sponsors for the conference and have our small business customers attend. We\u2019re committed to ensuring small businesses have a seat at the policy table as the UK government develops its two flagship small business programmes.\n\nHere\u2019s what Intuit\u2019s small business customers had to say on the issues that mattered most to them.\n\nDriving digital adoption\n\nUK small businesses that integrate digital tools into their business are more likely to report increased productivity. Digital tool adoption is proving transformative for small businesses across the UK. As Claire Witz, Owner of Chimpology in Tunbridge Wells and Kent, said, \u2018My business operates entirely around digital tools. Digital tools allow me to find the right solutions and integrations for all my clients\u2019 needs.\u2019 And Carly Straughan, Director of QLINE Consulting LTD, noted, \u2018I\u2019ve seen firsthand: digital tools aren\u2019t just about efficiency, they\u2019re about unlocking potential, for my team and my clients.\u2019\n\nThe more that policymakers can provide educational resources, accelerate digital adoption through private-sector collaboration, and modernise government programs for SMBs, the more digital tools will help level the playing field.\n\nDemocratising access to AI\n\nGovernments around the world are exploring regulatory frameworks to prevent harmful AI outcomes, but small businesses are often an afterthought in these debates. James Vincent, Co-Founder & CEO of Hot Source Creative in Bath, shared the impact AI tools have on his business: \u2018AI has been a game-changer in our business, particularly in content creation, audience segmentation, and campaign optimization. Tools like AI-powered analytics and automation have allowed us to provide more data-driven marketing strategies for clients.\u2019 Emma Thomson, Founder of Gemz by Emz in Romford, also stated, \u2018I\u2019m all for AI. Intuit AI\u2019s tools especially have led to me getting a lot more sales, a lot more engagement, and a lot more customers. AI can be really good for small businesses.\u2019\n\nAI has the potential to tip the scale in favor of small businesses, but they need a seat at the table to ensure that regulation works for them and not just for larger businesses. James Vincent also shared, \u2018Tax incentives for AI adoption or funding for AI training, would level the playing field and help small businesses compete in an increasingly digital marketplace.\u201d Without additional support, James believes that, \u2018We risk seeing a widening gap between AI-enabled businesses and those unable to access these technologies.\u2019\n\nUnlocking the small business data\n\nInitiatives like Open Banking have enabled better financial management, improved forecasting, and faster payment of invoices. Unlocking more data across the UK economy could help small businesses to access alternative lending, boost e-commerce revenue generation, and simplify net zero reporting.\n\nAs Simon Groom, CEO of MagnifyB in Warrington, said: \u2018We need a funding ecosystem that values potential over rigid metrics. To encourage innovation, invest in platforms that empower small businesses with real data and insights, and champion organizations that truly amplify our small business voices.\n\nPowering prosperity for small businesses\n\nIntuit will continue to empower small businesses to share their thoughts directly with policymakers. With robust government support, UK SMBs can overcome obstacles and achieve sustainable growth, contributing to a thriving national economy. After all, the impact small businesses have on the economy is anything but small. Intuit is also excited to announce more exciting plans in store for our customers in April 2025 to ensure they\u2019re included in policy conversations. Be sure to stay tuned!",

The publication revealed its 2025 World\u2019s Greatest Places list on Thursday.\n\nAn added bonus: Californians won't have far to go for a couple of places. Two of Time's choices are in Los Angeles: Intuit Dome and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's Commons wing (NHM Commons).\n\nThe list outside of California features hotels, cruises, museums, parks, and more in two categories: places to stay and places to visit. According to its website, TIME\u2019s editorial team evaluates entries based on factors including relevance, innovation, impact, and success.\n\n\"The tourism industry rebounded to pre-pandemic levels in 2023, and surged ahead in 2024, setting consumer-spending records and accounting for an estimated 9% to 10% of global GDP, and this year, it looks to pull in even more money,\" TIME editors said in a statement. \"For our annual list of the World\u2019s Greatest Places, TIME sought out one-of-a-kind spots and experiences around the globe.\"\n\nHere is what to know about the two California locations that made Time's 2025 World\u2019s Greatest Places and some other highlights from each category (entries on the list are not ranked in any particular order).\n\nTime's World\u2019s Greatest Places of 2025: Intuit Dome\n\nThe newly opened long-anticipated Intuit Dome, the home of the Los Angeles Clippers and splashy concert venue in Inglewood, was described as a \"slam dunk\" and an \"entertainment powerhouse\" by Time.\n\nThe $2 billion arena, which opened in August 2024, boasts an 80,000-square-foot outdoor plaza with bars, restaurants, and a 5,000-square-foot retail store.\n\nInside the stadium hangs what stadium representatives described as the largest-ever double-sided halo display, covering nearly an entire acre with more than 233 million LED lights, and more than 17,700 20-inch-wide seats.\n\nThe arena also showcases an impressive public art collection (sculptures, paintings, and digital media), developed in collaboration with local artists, Time wrote.\n\nWhen ground was first broken on the project in September of 2021, developers expected to generate $260 million in annual economic activity within the city. During construction, 7,000 jobs were created, and 30% of all permanent jobs are performed by Inglewood residents.\n\nSince its August opening, the Intuit Dome has hosted such powerhouse performers as Bruno Mars, Olivia Rodrigo, Billy Joel, Weezer, and Lady Gaga.\n\nTime's World\u2019s Greatest Places of 2025: NHM Commons\n\nThe NHM Commons, a newly restored $75 million wing at Los Angeles\u2019 Natural History Museum, opened in November 2024 to much fanfare, which Time wrote was much deserved.\n\nThe 75,000-square-foot space features a vibrant gathering place with a courtyard, amphitheater, garden, murals, places to eat, a multi-purpose theater, and probably most impressively, a huge long-neck dinosaur skeleton nicknamed Gnatalie.\n\n\"The 75,000-square-foot NHM Commons lives up to its name: this is, above all, a community space,\" Time wrote.\n\nTIME\u2019s 2025 World\u2019s Greatest Places: Places to stay\n\nBanyan Tree Veya Valle de Guadalupe \u2013 Ensenada, Mexico\n\nAlta Sanctuary \u2013 Peruvian Amazon Rainforest\n\nKasbah Tamadot \u2013 Asni, Morocco\n\nWaldorf Astoria New York \u2013 New York City\n\nLas Qolqas Eco Lodge \u2013 Ollantaytambo, Peru\n\nAlpeta Agrotourism & Winery \u2013 Roshnik, Albania\n\nThe Radical \u2013 Asheville, North Carolina\n\nGeorgia Safari Conservation Park \u2013 Madison, Georgia\n\nThe Lodge Wadjemup \u2013 Rottnest Island, Australia\n\nHX Grand Greenland cruise \u2013 Nuuk, Greenland\n\nNipponia \u2013 Sado Aikawa, Japan\n\nThe Ranch Hudson Valley \u2013 Sloatsburg, New York\n\nPowder Mountain \u2013 Eden, Utah\n\nAKI Family Resort Plose \u2013 South Tyrol, Italy\n\nH\u00f4tel Swexan \u2013 Dallas, Texas\n\nTIME\u2019s 2025 World\u2019s Greatest Places: Places to visit\n\nThe Beijing Library \u2013 Beijing, China\n\nStockholm Archipelago Trail \u2013 Sweden\n\nThe Wine Spa \u2013 Portland, Oregon\n\nNintendo Museum \u2013 Kyoto, Japan\n\nOcmulgee Mounds National Historical Park \u2013 Macon, Georgia\n\nHo Chi Minh City Metro \u2013 Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\n\nCasa Cultural Nuestra Herencia cafe and art gallery \u2013 Bogot\u00e1, Colombia\n\nTrosten sauna \u2013 Oslo, Norway\n\nLongwood Gardens \u2013 Kennett Square, Pennsylvania\n\nBluey's World \u2013 Queensland, Australia\n\nKasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument \u2013 Cochiti Pueblo, New Mexico\n\nCanadian Canoe Museum \u2013 Peterborough, Ontario, Canada\n\nZebun Nessa Mosque \u2013 Bangladesh\n\nThe Pekoe Trail \u2013 Central Highlands, Sri Lanka\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw \u2013 Poland\n\nVisit TIME's website to see the full list.",

Yet this concept may have seemed farfetched or fleeting \u2026 until now. First, enter Intuit\u2019s new Tap to Pay on iPhone feature.\n\nGet to know Tap to Pay on iPhone and its game-changing features\n\nMuch like the way you now use Apple Pay or the contactless chip feature in a debit/credit card to pay for takeout pizza, a tank of gas, or the bill at a convenience store, Tap to Pay on iPhone allows your clients to get paid in-person or on-the-go, quickly and easily.\n\nBy simply having the QuickBooks Mobile or GoPayment iOS apps set up on their iPhone, your clients not only get paid instantly in just one tap, but also get the luxury of having these transactions sync directly to their QuickBooks Online account, allowing them to seamlessly auto-categorize and reconcile these payments to keep their books up to date, all on a single platform.\n\n\u201cWith Tap to Pay on iPhone, we\u2019re giving customers a competitive advantage that accelerates cash flow, business growth, and customer loyalty,\u201d said David Hahn, senior vice president, Intuit QuickBooks Money Platform. \u201cWhat makes Tap to Pay on iPhone unique for QuickBooks customers is that it allows them to streamline their in-person payments and seamlessly connect them to their books and our end-to-end services, putting their full business finances all in one place. These new features, coupled with our AI-powered platform and \u2018done-for-you\u2019 experiences, empower small businesses to reach new levels of growth and success.\u201d\n\nProAdvisor Alicia Katz Pollock, MAT, ACN, MOUS, co-founder of Royalwise Solutions and host of the popular Unofficial QuickBooks Accountants Podcast, believes Tap to Pay on iPhone will have everyone buzzing to tap into this game-changing feature.\n\n\u201cNow that QuickBooks Online has Tap to Pay on iPhone, any staff member can take payments onsite with clients, whether you\u2019re at a craft show, a farmer\u2019s market, or a conference,\u201d she said. \u201cI love that you can have as many users as you want, and it\u2019s so simple to use. Just open Tap to Pay on the QuickBooks mobile app, have your employees type in a dollar amount, or tap on your Products and Services list to add items to your cart. When it\u2019s time to check out, your customer just taps their contactless payment\u2014from Apple Pay, to contactless credit or debit cards, to your iPhone, and the sale is done. Email the receipt and you\u2019re complete!\u201d\n\nThe ability to easily pay an invoice is just one benefit of Tap to Pay on iPhone. Here\u2019s a list of some of its additional benefits.\n\nHighlights of Tap to Pay on iPhone\n\nSeamless payments. By getting paid in-person or on the go seamlessly through the QuickBooks mobile or GoPayment apps, the need for a physical POS device or hardware is eliminated. And those payments are automatically recorded and organized for your clients, making both your lives easier come tax time.\n\nBy getting paid in-person or on the go seamlessly through the QuickBooks mobile or GoPayment apps, the need for a physical POS device or hardware is eliminated.

Private, secure business and customer data. By accepting payments with the security of an iPhone, Apple\u2019s Tap to Pay on iPhone technology uses the built-in iPhone features to privately secure your customer\u2019s data. When a payment is processed, Apple doesn\u2019t store card numbers or transaction information on the device or on Apple servers.\n\nWith the new Tap to Pay on iPhone feature to help you and your clients get paid, Pollock is excited about its peace of mind, and the time and effort it will save.\n\n\u201cIt makes QuickBooks Online truly mobile, and fully replaces any need for Square, or in some cases, a full-blown POS system,\u201d she said. \u201cNo more writing down sales on a pad of paper and entering them back in the office. It\u2019s one and done!\u201d\n\nQuickBooks Online Now Also Enables Recurring Payments\n\nAnother new feature\u2014Recurring Payments\u2014expands the invoicing and payment capabilities for anyone using QuickBooks Online in the US, leading to next-level convenience and solutions for your clients and their customers. With Recurring Payments, your clients can leverage QuickBooks Payments to streamline repeat sales or products to get automatically paid on a regular basis. This eliminates the tedious and time-consuming manual work of creating repeat invoices or sending payment questions and reminders.\n\nThe result? Your clients will worry less about chasing customers for invoices and focus more time on running and growing their businesses\u2014something recurring payments is all about.\n\n\u201cThe addition of recurring payments gives our customers the power to not only maintain and accelerate their cash flow, but also increase client satisfaction and loyalty,\u201d said Hahn. \u201cOur data shows that more than half of small business owners have invoices that are overdue by more than 30 days, so we\u2019re always focused on finding a way to help increase the likelihood of our customers getting paid on time. Recurring Payments directly addresses this challenge, streamlining the end-to-end payments experience for the business owner and their clients, and providing confidence that invoices will be paid on time and cash flow will remain consistent.\u201d\n\nHighlights of Recurring Payments\n\nAutomation that saves time and increases cash flow. Schedule recurring payments for repeat customers or products\u2014reducing the need for manual work and subsequent disruptions. In addition, your clients can expect cash flow whenever they need it because they will get paid on time, every time.\n\nSchedule recurring payments for repeat customers or products\u2014reducing the need for manual work and subsequent disruptions.

According to the 2024 Intuit QuickBooks Quarterly Small Business Insights report that surveyed 5,000 small businesses, 51% have invoices overdue by more than 30 days, with an average of $27,000 in unpaid invoices owed.\n\nGet more information about Tap to Pay on iPhone and more details on recurring payments to see how your clients will get paid easier and faster.\n\n====\n\nBryan Cytron is vice president of Cytron and Company.

(Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA \u2014 Los Angeles County is home to two of the best places to visit on Earth, according to Time's 2025 World's Greatest Places list.\n\nIn putting together its list, Time sought out what it called one-of-a-kind spots and experiences around the globe. From an Amazonian restaurant in Peru to a luxury resort overlooking a waterfall in Zimbabwe, Time's list of 100 extraordinary destinations includes a wide variety of places. Los Angeles County is home to two of those 100 destinations, both in the \"Places to Visit\" category: Intuit Dome and the new wing of the Natural History Museum.\n\n\"Los Angeles hit a slam dunk with the launch of the new Intuit Dome. This is more than a shiny new home for the LA Clippers. It\u2019s emerging as an entertainment powerhouse,\" Time wrote. The $2 billion arena is home to the Los Angeles Clippers and is a popular concert venue; in January the Dome hosted the FireAid benefit concert, featuring Billie Eilish, Joni Mitchell, a Nirvana reunion and more.\n\nThe Dome features five basketball courts \u2014 the game court, two practice courts, one promotional court and one court on the outdoor plaza. In addition, it features 86,000 square feet of training, medical and player spaces, including an indoor pool, and an 80,000-square-foot outdoor plaza that features two bars, a restaurant and 5,000-square-foot team store. The seating area features what is known as The Wall, a 51-row section with strict rules designed to ensure only Clippers fans are admitted \u2014 through restrictions on ticket resale and the wearing of opposing team gear. An immersive sound system measures levels not just for the arena, but for every seat, each of which comes with its own USB port.\n\nThe Dome is also highlighted by a public art collection of works created by local artists, including murals, sculptures and digital displays. Time also named the new $75 million wing of the National History Museum to its list.",

            "content": "Investing in wide-moat companies can be a strategy for long-term wealth creation, as these businesses tend to generate stable cash flows, withstand market turbulence, and reward shareholders through dividends and stock appreciation. While no investment is entirely risk-free, companies with strong economic moats provide a level of durability that many investors seek in an ever-changing market. Our Wide Moat Screen makes it easy to identify high-potential stocks at any given time \u2014 just like the ones mentioned above.\n\nOne of the key reasons investors seek out wide-moat stocks is their ability to deliver consistent returns over the long term. Unlike firms in highly competitive industries where profits are volatile due to pricing pressure and competition, wide-moat companies often demonstrate resilience during economic downturns and market fluctuations. Their established market position and strong balance sheets help them weather challenges that might cripple less-competitive businesses.\n\nCompanies with wide economic moats benefit from factors such as brand strength, cost advantages, network effects, regulatory barriers and economies of scale. These characteristics make it challenging for new entrants or existing competitors to erode their market share. Businesses with wide moats often enjoy strong pricing power, consistent profit margins and the ability to reinvest in their operations, further strengthening their competitive edge.\n\nAmong the companies that exemplify wide economic moats are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. , NVIDIA Corp. , Intuit Inc. and S&P Global Inc. . Each of these companies operates in industries with significant barriers to entry and enjoys advantages that make it difficult for competitors to challenge their positions.\n\nThe concept of a wide moat refers to companies that possess strong, lasting competitive advantages that insulate them from competition and allow them to sustain long-term profitability. The term, popularized by Warren Buffett, likens a company's market position to a medieval castle surrounded by a wide moat \u2014 difficult for rivals to cross and attack.\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 13, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. TSM, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Intuit Inc. INTU and S&P Global Inc. SPGI.\n\nStory Continues\n\nReady to uncover more transformative thematic investment ideas?

It enjoys a formidable moat due to its technological superiority and scale. As the primary manufacturer for companies like Appleand NVIDIA, Taiwan Semiconductor operates with a cost advantage and maintains its dominance by investing heavily in advanced chip fabrication, making it nearly impossible for new entrants to compete at the same level.\n\nThe ongoing AI boom has placed Taiwan Semiconductor at the center of a multi-year structural growth cycle. The company has established itself as the preferred manufacturing partner for AI accelerators, including graphics processing units (GPUs) and custom silicon developed by major players. In 2024, AI-related revenues tripled, accounting for a mid-teen percentage of total revenues. TSM expects this segment to double again in 2025, reflecting continued investment from hyperscalers and data center operators.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's aggressive capital expenditure strengthens its competitive advantage. Its global expansion strategy also adds to its growth potential. It has begun high-volume production at its Arizona facility, while additional fabs are under construction in Japan and Germany. These investments reflect this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock's long-term vision of securing global supply-chain resilience while meeting growing customer demand.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA, a leader in GPUs and AI, possesses a technological moat that keeps it ahead of competitors. Its cutting-edge GPUs are essential for gaming, AI computing and data centers, creating strong demand across multiple industries. The company's substantial investment in research and development ensures technological superiority, while its CUDA software ecosystem further locks in customers by making it difficult to switch to alternative platforms.\n\nDatacenter presents a solid growth opportunity for this Zacks Rank #2 stock. As more and more businesses are shifting toward cloud, the need for datacenters is increasing. To cater to this huge demand, datacenter operators like Amazon and Microsoftare expanding their operations across the world, which is driving demand for GPUs. Further, NVIDIA plans to focus on new growth boosters for its data center business, such as inference, data science and machine learning techniques, to consolidate its presence in this niche market.\n\nNVIDIA is rapidly gaining traction in enterprise AI, expanding its market beyond cloud providers. Major companies across industries are integrating NVIDIA's AI platforms to automate workflows, enhance productivity and improve decision-making. The company's DGX Cloud AI infrastructure, which allows enterprises to train and deploy AI models at scale, has seen increased adoption. The generative AI revolution also continues to be a tailwind for NVIDIA. The company's Hopper 200 and upcoming Blackwell GPUs are designed for training and inference of large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications.\n\nIntuit, the financial software giant, has established a powerful economic moat through brand loyalty, network effects and high switching costs. Its widely used tax and accounting software has become the industry standard for small businesses, accountants and individual users. The company continuously enhances its AI-driven automation features, further embedding users within its ecosystem. Once customers adopt Intuit's services, switching to a competitor becomes difficult due to the integration of financial data and the learning curve involved in adapting to a new system. This lock-in effect strengthens Intuit's pricing power and enables it to maintain strong margins.\n\nIntuit has two main products \u2014 QuickBooks, which offers financial and business management online services and desktop software to small businesses, and TurboTax, which offers income tax preparation products and services. The space in which Intuit operates has huge growth opportunities. There are over 29 million small and medium businesses in the United States alone. Intuit, with its QuickBooks Online Advanced solution, is now targeting the midmarket. Furthermore, the number of individuals preferring to file their income tax themselves is increasing rapidly, thereby expanding the scope for Intuit's TurboTax software.\n\nFor the last few years, this Zacks Rank #2 company has been trying to shift its business model from selling software to cloud-based subscription providers. Cloud-based solutions, against software-based ones, have gained popularity as they offer anywhere, anytime access. Cloud is a flourishing part of the technology space and has been gaining momentum in recent years.\n\nIt is a process by which data or software is stored outside of a computer and is accessible from anywhere at any time via the Internet. This revolutionary idea can lower IT costs of companies by cutting down the need for servers and staff. The acquisition of Credit Karma has also expanded Intuit's customer base, allowing it to help its customers better manage their personal finance requirements.\n\nS&P Global, a leader in financial information and credit ratings, benefits from an economic moat driven by its brand strength, regulatory influence and data-driven services. Its credit rating business is essential for businesses, governments and investors, as its ratings are widely recognized and are often required to issue bonds.\n\n\n\nThe company's proprietary financial data, benchmarks and analytics services provide indispensable tools for market participants, ensuring customer reliance on its offerings. Due to the trust and credibility S&P Global has built over decades, new competitors struggle to enter the space, giving the company pricing power and a stable revenue stream from subscription-based services.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 company is benefiting from the growing demand for business information services. The constantly increasing volume of data from private and government organizations has augmented the demand for improved enterprise-wide financial performance visibility. Higher demand for news, information and analytics solutions will drive the growth of the market.\n\nFurther, the industry is benefiting from the rising demand for risk mitigation. Changes in market dynamics are more or less a constant phenomenon and keep companies exposed to credit fund and operational risks. Accurate market and financial information is required for risk mitigation, and this spurs demand for business information services.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

The announcement of continued share buybacks also signals confidence in its long-term strategy. During a period of market volatility, with the Nasdaq Composite experiencing significant fluctuations, Intuit's modest gain aligns with broader technology sector movements. The market's response to the encouraging Consumer Price Index report, which suggested potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, may have tempered some of the broader economic concerns, slightly steadying investor sentiment towards the technology sector, including companies like Intuit.\n\nAccording our valuation report, there's an indication that Intuit's share price might be on the cheaper side.\n\nNasdaqGS:INTU Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nReady For A Different Approach?

Key factors may have influenced this performance. Earnings announcements, such as those on March 25, 2025, highlight consistent revenue growth from US$3.39 billion year-over-year to US$3.96 billion, cementing investor confidence. Intuit has successfully executed share buybacks, increasing the value returned to shareholders, such as the repurchase of 1.13 million shares between November 2024 and January 2025.\n\nAdditionally, the company's commitment to innovation, illustrated by the launch of \"Tap to Pay on iPhone\" in March 2025, and quarterly dividends (1.04 per share announced February 20, 2025) reflects strong shareholder return policies. Despite these accomplishments, over the past year Intuit's shares underperformed relative to the broader US market, highlighting the challenges within the tech sector. New enhancements in product offerings and gold-standard integrations have further fortified Intuit's standing in the ever-evolving financial management landscape.\n\nAlready own Intuit?

Jobber, for example, says it integrates with QuickBooks and Stripe.\n\nIntuit said its new payment feature will sync directly with a customer\u2019s QuickBooks online account to manage payments and keep their books updated.\n\nIntuit\u2019s solution will accept contactless credit and debit cards, Apple Pay and other digital wallets, without the need for separate hardware to accept a payment.\n\n\u201cThe thing we kept hearing from our customers was that they\u2019d lose the dongles, they\u2019d get smashed by heavy equipment, the Wi-Fi wouldn\u2019t work, all kinds of problems,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cWhat we realized is that, especially with tap-to-pay, we had an opportunity to enable all of our customers, and especially all those in the mobile app, to instantly be able to accept credit cards.\u201d\n\nAn illustration of Intuit\u2019s recurring payments online dashboard. Permission granted by Intuit\n\nThe new smartphone payment option came with separate Intuit news that the company is beginning a recurring payments feature. The goal is to get rid of a small business\u2019s need to create invoices or send payment requests for repeat sales of services or products, such as a lawn service or pool cleaning.\n\nSmall businesses carry an average of $27,000 in unpaid invoices they\u2019re owed, and more than half of small businesses have invoices that are more than 30 days late, according to Intuit\u2019s July 2024 quarterly survey of around 5,000 companies in the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K.\n\nIntuit, which is based in Mountain View, California, says it processed $124 billion in online payments in its 2024 fiscal year, up 20% from the previous year.",

            "content": "Amid strong competition to become the go-to point-of-sale provider for small- to medium-sized businesses, Intuit has introduced a solution that allows QuickBooks Online users to accept payments directly on their iPhone.\n\nWhile tap-to-pay tech isn\u2019t new, Intuit\u2019s offering integrates is that it seamlessly with its QuickBooks suite, allowing small business owners to reconcile payments and manage their finances in one place.\n\nAccording to data from QuickBooks, nearly half of U.S. small businesses report that cash flow is a significant challenge. Intuit believes its solution can help optimize cash flow while giving customers a convenient payment option\u2014without the need for a traditional point-of-sale (POS) system.\n\n\u201cIntuit used to have a POS that worked with QuickBooks, but when I went to research for our recent Small Business POS Scorecard, I discovered that Intuit announced the end of life (EOL) on the POS platform,\u201d said Don Apgar, Director of Merchant Payments at Javelin Strategy & Research. \u201cIt looks like from this announcement that the POS is being replaced by an app that includes tap-to-phone payment acceptance and some basic features like invoicing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn putting together our scorecard, I saw how super-competitive the POS market has become for small business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes sense that QuickBooks would pull back from trying to keep up in that space, and switch to offering a mobile app that includes basic functions like the ability to accept card payments.\u201d\n\nTap-to-Phone Traction\n\nMobile devices have been able to accept payments through add-on devices, like Square\u2019s dongles, for some time. However, after Apple unlocked its NFC technology to third-party developers last year, many solutions have emerged that can turn iPhones into payment terminals.\n\nAlso known as tap-to-phone, these solutions have quickly gained traction with small businesses because they allow merchants to accept multiple payment types without the need for expensive hardware.\n\nAccording to Visa, nearly 30% of tap-to-phone users are new small businesses. These solutions are especially powerful for gig economy workers, creators, and side hustlers, who can use their existing device to accept card payments anywhere.",

The estimate suggests year-over-year growth of 11.44%. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $7.56 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 12.19%.\n\nINTU beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 11.85%.\n\nWhat Should Investors Do With INTU Stock?\n\nIntuit has positioned itself at the forefront of the industry with a high-demand product portfolio, including QuickBooks, TurboTax, Credit Karma, and Mailchimp, that caters to individuals, small businesses, and medium businesses.

Users can put their payments on \"auto-pilot\" by setting a schedule and an amount and then sharing that with the client.

The feature helps clients avoid service disruptions and avoid past-due bills, and provides streamlined bookkeeping where transactions are automatically updated with each payment with no need for matching. It offers extra security as users do not need to ask for payment information directly since clients can just input their information once and manage it through a secure online portal. Users also get access to Intuit Assist , which can detect repeat invoices that are sent to the same clients on a regular cadence, and create a suggested recurring payment and schedule for the business owner to review and approve.\n\n\"The addition of recurring payments gives our customers the power to not only maintain and accelerate their cash flow, but also increase client satisfaction and loyalty,\" said David Hahn, senior vice president of the QuickBooks Money Platform. \"Our data shows that more than half of small business owners have invoices that are overdue by more than 30 days, so we're always focused on finding a way to help increase the likelihood of our customers getting paid on time. Recurring payments directly addresses this challenge, streamlining the end-to-end payments experience for the business owner and their clients, and providing confidence that invoices will be paid on time and cash flow will remain consistent. This feature, along with the many 'done-for-you' experiences across our AI-powered platform, empowers businesses to streamline operations and fuel their growth and success.\"\n\nRecurring payments are now available for QuickBooks Online customers in the U.S. who have a QuickBooks Payments plan added to their subscription.",

            "content": "With smoke still in the air and only days to prepare, a team of live sound and broadcast professionals put together FireAid, a massive two-venue, six-hour, 35-artist live production that raised more than $100 million for those most affected by the L.A. fires.\n\nLos Angeles, CA (March 10, 2024)\u2014Throughout January, southern California was hit by a series of raging wildfires that tore through the L.A. metropolitan area and San Diego County, burning more than 57,000 acres of land. By month\u2019s end, 29 people had been killed, more than 200,000 had been forced to evacuate, and more than 18,000 homes and buildings had burned to the ground or been severely damaged. It will take years and upward of an estimated $400 billion for the region to build back, but for those who lost their homes, livelihoods and communities, the personal impact is incalculable.\n\nReacting to the disaster before the fires had even been contained, the music industry did what it often does best, as it brought together an army of artists and professionals to hold a giant charity concert that would raise money for those in need. Envisioned only days after the fires began, FireAid was held Thursday, January 30, presenting more than 30 top artists in a massive six-hour benefit concert that was broadcast live on 28 video and music streaming platforms.\n\nPerformers included Billie Eilish, Jelly Roll, Green Day, Katy Perry, Rod Stewart, Stevie Wonder, Stevie Nicks, Sting, John Mayer, Joni Mitchell, No Doubt, Pink, Dawes, Olivia Rodrigo, Lady Gaga, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Anderson.Paak and many more. Garnering an estimated 50 million viewers, the show generated more than $100 million in only a few days, allowing the FireAid Grants Advisory Committee, led by the Annenberg Foundation, to start awarding grants in mid-February.\n\nThe show itself was so large that it had to be held simultaneously at two L.A. arenas, the Intuit Dome and Kia Forum, alternating between venues for much of the broadcast. Events of that magnitude typically take months to set up, but hitting January 30 was a must, as most of the artists involved were in Los Angeles that week for the Grammy Awards. As a result, FireAid was not only a massive fundraising success, but also a herculean accomplishment for the production team members behind the live sound and broadcast\u2014many of whom were affected by the fires themselves.\n\nROCKING THE HOUSE\n\n\u201cWe were reached out to on January 15, with a vague idea for a show that was significantly smaller than what we ended up doing,\u201d chuckled Mark Dittmar, vice president at Firehouse Productions, Red Hook, N.Y. \u201cWe had two big shows coming up with the SNL 50th anniversary and the NBA All-Star game, and then this jumped in front of them, so it made for a very challenging time to pull everything together.\n\n\u201cTwo days later, we had to take a blind guess and put a giant pile of hardware on a semi to send to our West Coast shop without knowing what the show would be like or what artists would be involved,\u201d he continued. \u201cThen we had to start putting together a crew\u2014about 40 people per venue. We started prepping in the shop, loaded in on the 27th, still hadn\u2019t talked to all the bands, didn\u2019t know how much space we needed or what connectivity we needed. We just had to roll with the punches as best we could.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Firehouse provided all live sound gear and crew for the Intuit Dome and Kia Forum except the latter\u2019s P.A., which was provided by Clair Global\u2019s ATK Audiotek and Eighth Day Sound. Sourcing audio crewmembers was a challenge in itself, not only due to the large number required, but also because many pros were already working on the Grammy Awards broadcast or events taking place around it. Nonetheless, roughly a third of the audio team came from the Los Angeles area, making the event\u2019s success a particularly personal goal for many.\n\nAll involved were anxious to do their part\u2014Dittmar and Simon Welsh, who were audio coordinators for the Intuit Dome and Kia Forum productions, respectively, saw that firsthand. \u201cEvery aspect of a show that you would normally spend two to three months working on, you had to spin up in under a week,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cEveryone dove in. It was impressive to watch a bunch of pros come together and cut loose, doing what they do best\u2014not working with a lot of paperwork, just with, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s get this done.\u2019 That\u2019s how it was; I remember telling my whole crew on day one, \u2018Everything in the speech I\u2019m giving you might already be false; you\u2019re just gonna have to roll with it and ask me lots of questions!\u2019\u201d\n\nNearly identical audio systems were fielded at both venues in order to simplify things, so all mixing desks were DiGiCo models, with Quantum 338s at the FOH positions and SD7s for mixing monitors. A giant Riedel Bolero wireless intercom system was built for both arenas and then networked between them, resulting in 65 Bolero units at both sites; there were roughly 300 channels of splits per venue, as well. Shure Axient Digital and Sennheiser D6000 and EM-3732 wireless systems were employed for wireless mics, while some Shure analog wireless handled guitar amps, and Shure PSM 1000 IEM systems were also used, all resulting in RF wranglers coordinating more than 100 frequencies.\n\nAt the Intuit Dome, Firehouse hung a JBL VTX V25-II line array system for the main, side and 270-degree P.A. hangs, bolstered by G28 subs on the ground. Meanwhile, at the Kia Forum, Eighth Day Sound and ATK Audiotek prepped and deployed a donated d&b audiotechnik KSL P.A. Stage monitoring at both sites was based around IEM systems, proprietary Firehouse F12 wedges and d&b J8 sidefills.\n\nAs January 30 drew closer, FireAid began to take shape. Each venue had an A/B turntable stage, allowing for a fast tear-down and setup on one side, while performers played on the other side, before the stage turned 180 degrees and the process started again. Unsurprisingly, the arrangement required considerable support; each audio crew included two front-of-house and two monitor engineers, a production mixer, three P.A. techs, three A2s per side of the stage, a floater A2, monitor system techs, in-ear monitor wranglers, a wireless mic team and more.\n\nArtists came through to soundcheck as they were available, not in show order, so no changeovers could be rehearsed. \u201cBands brought in their own engineers, so we were working with them to quickly do file integrations\u2014again, all of this is stuff that you normally spend a while advancing,\u201d said Dittmar. \u201cI think the single most challenging part was that there was no dress rehearsal; we never practiced a single set change. Stevie Wonder was by far the tightest one, and that was a bit of a heart attack to do in seven minutes.\u201d\n\nOne logistical hurdle didn\u2019t involve the production at all, but rather, the audience. As originally conceived, the show would have started in both venues at the same time, switching between the arenas throughout the six-hour timeframe. However, the Kia Forum and Intuit Dome are only a mile apart, so there was a staggered start in order to ease traffic congestion in the surrounding area. As a result, the Kia Forum began first, tackling the first two hours of the show until the Intuit Dome joined in, allowing the broadcast to alternate between venues for two hours, before finishing off with two hours solely at the Intuit Dome.\n\nThroughout the marathon that was FireAid, the crews stayed on point, working hard to ensure that the lack of dress rehearsal wouldn\u2019t result in a shaggy show. \u201cI was definitely on pins and needles, but it went really well,\u201d Dittmar admitted. \u201cThere were certainly some jokes of, \u2018Gosh, maybe we shouldn\u2019t rehearse anything in the future.\u2019 All these teams of people do large shows, so we are not unfamiliar with the scale, but this amount of prep time was definitely not normal, and it really makes you pay attention.\n\n\u201cAlso, there\u2019s a higher reason that you\u2019re there; you\u2019re not just there doing a gig,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to do good and help the cause out, and I think people definitely behaved differently on site. There was more of a sense of community, not even just among the audio team, but guest engineers coming in as well. Everyone was very cordial and very, very accommodating. interdepartmental was just amazing. We work with great lighting and scenic and video teams all the time, but it was just a bit more in lockstep to get it all done. That said, it was exhausting because of the amount of focus that we had to pay for that period of time. When the show was done, our crew was definitely cooked!\u201d\n\nCONTINUE ON TO PART 2: STREAMING TO THE WORLD",

While most of these tools promise to simplify financial management, many fall short in key areas.\n\nCommon pain points include outdated interfaces that frustrate users, automation features that don\u2019t save as much time as advertised, and integration issues that make syncing with other business systems a headache. Then there\u2019s the challenge of scalability. Some platforms work fine for small businesses but buckle under the needs of growing enterprises. With these factors in mind, I\u2019ve tested and curated a list of the best accounting software solutions that stand out for their usability, functionality, and value.\n\nWhat do we think about the future of accounting software? \u201cThe accounting software industry has historically been slow to adapt to new trends, but COVID-19 forced the industry to digitally transform to support a remote work environment. In my opinion, the most notable and important advancement is cloud-based accounting software.\n\n\n\nAs companies look to decrease their accounting stack spending, especially in the current economic downturn that we are experiencing, cloud computing allows organizations to pay for a subscription-based solution, which can cost vastly less than purchasing a product and installing it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2013 Nathan Calabrese, Senior Research Analyst, G2\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking for robust reporting, seamless integrations, advanced automation, or an intuitive way to handle daily bookkeeping, this guide will help you find the right accounting solution.\n\nBest accounting Software I recommend for 2025 NetSuite for managing accounting with inventory, order management, and billing (pricing available on request) Sage Intacct for financial accounting with revenue recognition (pricing available on request) QuickBooks Online for essential accounting functions like income tracking, invoicing, and financial reporting ($17.5/month) QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise for businesses needing advanced accounting and extensive financial control ($1922/year) Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central for businesses requiring integrated financial and operational management ($70/month) Xero for invoicing, expense tracking, and robust bank reconciliation ($2.9/month) Intuit QuickBooks for essential financial management tools like bookkeeping, payroll, and invoicing (pricing available on request) FreshBooks for freelancers and small businesses looking to manage invoicing, track expenses tracking, and handle client accounts ($162.45/year) SAP S/4HANA Cloud for integrating ERP with complex accounting, finance, and treasury management (pricing available on request) Acumatica for a full suite of accounting applications with flexible deployment options (pricing available on request) FloQast for accounting teams looking to handle financial close with automated reconciliation and team collaboration (pricing available on request) *These accounting software solutions are top-rated in their category, according to G2 Grid Reports.

It provided financial reporting, tax compliance, and budgeting tools, simplifying our workflows and ensuring accuracy.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the best accounting software? I spent weeks collaborating with finance and accounting teams, exploring how accounting software performs in real-world scenarios: what it does well, where it struggles, and whether it\u2019s worth the investment. I also used artificial intelligence to analyze hundreds of product reviews on G2, uncovering users' needs, motivations, and pain points. I looked at G2\u2019s Grid Reports to evaluate how these solutions compare against each other in features, usability, and value. After thorough research and hands-on experience, I\u2019ve compiled this detailed list of the best accounting software.\n\nThe best accounting software solutions have made it easier for us to automate repetitive tasks like generating recurring invoices, categorizing expenses using AI tools, and calculating payroll taxes in compliance with local regulations. They provide real-time insights through dynamic dashboards and detailed reports, such as profit and loss statements, cash flow forecasts, and tax summaries. With its advanced integrations into ERP systems, CRM platforms, and payment gateways, we can seamlessly sync data, eliminate manual entry, and minimize errors in our financial workflows.\n\nWhat I think defines the best accounting software\n\nI considered the following factors when evaluating the best accounting software solutions.\n\nAligns with your workflows: I\u2019ve seen how accounting systems that support advanced features like multi-entity consolidations, accrual-based accounting, and inter-company eliminations can save time and reduce errors. Scalability is crucial, too. Accounting software solutions that handle high transaction volumes without slowing down are invaluable, especially as your business grows. I\u2019ve also found modular add-ons helpful for expanding functionality, such as integrating inventory management or project accounting down the line.\n\nI\u2019ve seen how accounting systems that support advanced features like multi-entity consolidations, accrual-based accounting, and inter-company eliminations can save time and reduce errors.

I\u2019ve also found modular add-ons helpful for expanding functionality, such as integrating inventory management or project accounting down the line. Reporting and analytics: In my experience, the ability to generate financial reports like trial balances, variance analyses, and cash flow forecasts is critical for decision-making. I\u2019ve worked with accounting software solutions that offer real-time dashboards with drill-down capabilities, which made it easier to analyze specific segments like regional performance or departmental budgets. Compliance-specific reports for tax filings (e.g., VAT, GST) and standards like IFRS or GAAP are also essential, especially during audits. The ability to export reports in multiple formats and connect to business intelligence tools like Tableau or Power BI has been invaluable for advanced analytics.\n\nIn my experience, the ability to generate financial reports like trial balances, variance analyses, and cash flow forecasts is critical for decision-making.

Whether it\u2019s connecting with a CRM like Salesforce, an ERP system like SAP, or a payment gateway like Stripe, integration reduces manual work and prevents data silos. Real-time synchronization helps us maintain accurate accounts receivable/payable records and reconcile bank transactions. I also appreciate pre-built connectors for third-party apps like Shopify or Zoho and data import/export features for simplifying workflows and migrating data from older systems or integrating historical financial data.\n\nI also value an accounting system\u2019s ability to integrate with other tools.

User experience: Having worked with various accounting tools, I know firsthand how critical user experience is. A responsive design that works across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices makes a big difference, especially for accessing data on the go. Role-based access management helps us control who sees or edits specific data. Some of the best systems I\u2019ve used also included AI-driven features like predictive data entry and automated journal entry suggestions, which saved us time. If you operate internationally, like I\u2019ve had to, multi-language and multi-currency support are essential for complying with local standards.\n\nHaving worked with various accounting tools, I know firsthand how critical user experience is.

Features like multi-factor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on (SSO) added an extra layer of security that gave us peace of mind. Regular vulnerability assessments and updates are critical for staying ahead of cybersecurity threats. I\u2019ve always looked for systems compliant with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). Audit trails are also invaluable for tracking actions and preventing fraud.\n\nThe best accounting software I\u2019ve used offered top-notch encryption, like AES-256, to protect data in transit and at rest.

Cloud hosting, updates, and training costs can add up, especially if the software has a steep learning curve. I\u2019ve also found 24/7 support invaluable and learned to account for potential downtime during implementation or migration and consulting fees for external help.\n\nI considered all these factors while evaluating 30+ accounting tools. I focused on how well the software aligned with my existing workflows and whether it could scale as the business grew. Features like workflow automation, multi-entity support, and modular add-ons were at the top of my list.\n\n\n\nReporting and analytics were equally important. I prioritized systems with detailed, customizable financial reports, real-time dashboards, and tools for meeting compliance requirements. Integration was another key area. I also checked if the software seamlessly connects with CRMs, ERPs, and payment gateways to streamline processes and minimize manual data entry. The 11 I selected excelled in all these areas.\n\nTo be included in the accounting software catergory, a product must:\n\nMaintain an organization\u2019s general ledger and manage its chart of accounts efficiently.\n\nProvide tools to automate accounts receivable processes and streamline invoicing.\n\nSimplify accounts payable workflows, including payment processing and managing purchase orders.\n\nEnable users to create and post journal entries for transaction adjustments and balance updates.\n\nTrack expenses and income while analyzing the profitability of products and services.\n\nManage cash flow, bank accounts, and multiple payment methods like checks, credit cards, and ACH transfers.\n\nSupport the financial close process to ensure accurate reporting at the end of each accounting period.\n\nGenerate standard financial reports, including statements and dashboards, to monitor key financial metrics.\n\n*This data was pulled from G2 in 2025.

NetSuite\n\nNetSuite is a cloud-based accounting software that promises to be your one-stop shop for everything: finance, reporting, and operations. After using it for a while, here\u2019s my take.\n\nNetSuite makes things ridiculously easy to navigate. Whether I\u2019m running detailed financial reports or just poking around for data, the interface feels intuitive. It also lets you customize workflows.\n\n\n\nI also appreciate its ability to handle multi-entity operations. Our business spans different divisions, and keeping everything in sync can be challenging. With NetSuite, consolidating financials across these entities is easier. And if you\u2019re a fan of dashboards and reports, NetSuite delivers. You can visualize data in many ways.\n\n\n\nI also love how NetSuite integrates with third-party tools. Whether it\u2019s CRM systems or inventory management software, NetSuite plays nice with others, saving us from hours of manual data entry.\n\n\n\nHowever, the interface feels dated. It works, but I can\u2019t help wishing it had a more modern design. And while it\u2019s generally customizable, I\u2019ve hit walls when trying to tweak certain features for niche business needs. For example, building custom reports sometimes takes longer than I\u2019d like because the process isn\u2019t as straightforward as it could be.\n\n\n\nAnd let me tell you, the learning curve is real, especially when you switch from something simpler like QuickBooks. NetSuite is undeniably powerful, but it\u2019s not exactly plug-and-play. Expect a bit of a struggle before you find your groove with complex modules like revenue recognition.\n\nWhat I like about NetSuite: I love how customizable it is. Whether I need specific workflows or tailored reports, I can tweak NetSuite to fit my business needs. It adapts to me rather than the other way around.\n\nThe multi-entity support is a lifesaver. Managing multiple divisions was a logistical nightmare for our team, but with NetSuite, consolidating everything is seamless. What G2 users like about NetSuite: \u201cI do like that we can pull additional data and more in-depth financial statements as opposed to what we could get from Quickbooks. It's also nice that we can run everything through NetSuite so we do not have to double-enter our sales and payments.\u201d\n\n\n\nNetSuite Review , Laura M.\n\nWhat I dislike about NetSuite:\n\nI wish the user interface had a more modern, intuitive design, making it easier on the eyes and quicker to navigate.\n\nSetting up custom reports can be frustrating. Even though the reporting capabilities are robust, figuring out how to get what I need sometimes feels like solving a puzzle.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about NetSuite:\n\n\u201cThe drawback I have seen so far is consistently connecting and interacting with our bank accounts. The account transactions, when imported, exist only on one screen. Unlike Quickbooks, you cannot use them to post to your general ledger. You must create your own NetSuite records to match the bank records. We also had some connection issues with manually importing CSV files for bank transactions.\u201d\n\n\n\n- NetSuite Review, Christopher W.\n\nUsing AI in accounting? Learn how AI technologies are changing accounting practices and the challenges you must prepare for.\n\n2. Sage Intacct\n\nLet me tell you about my experience of using Sage Intacct. It\u2019s one of those accounting solutions that make you feel like you\u2019ve hit the jackpot. From the get-go, I was impressed by how intuitive the interface is.\n\nI first noticed how customizable Sage Intacct is. I\u2019ve set it up to automate recurring tasks like invoicing and even handle financial consolidations across multiple entities, and honestly, it feels like it\u2019s working just for me. And let me tell you, the automation is great, too. We don\u2019t waste hours on manual entries or tedious reconciliations. During testing, Sage Intacct took care of all that for us in the background so we could focus on the bigger stuff.\n\n\n\nThe reporting capabilities blew us away. You can slice and dice your data in ways I didn\u2019t even think were possible. I love its ability to offer multi-dimensional reports and create custom dashboards. Plus, it integrates with everything we need: Salesforce, payroll systems, you name it.\n\n\n\nI also love how Sage Intacct handles multi-entity, multi-currency operations like they\u2019re second nature\u2014no more Excel nightmares trying to consolidate different subsidiaries\u2019 data.\n\n\n\nHowever, I spent more time Googling how-tos than I\u2019d like to admit. So, expect a learning curve for advanced things like building custom reports or handling intricate audits.\n\n\n\nWhile the performance is excellent, things can slow down when dealing with massive datasets or complex reports. I\u2019ve had moments where I wished it was just a little snappier.\n\n\n\nThe error messages could use some love, too. When something goes wrong\u2014like a file upload error\u2014it\u2019s not always clear what the issue is. You play detective to figure it out, which can be frustrating when you\u2019re on a deadline.\n\n\n\nLastly, while their customer support team is helpful, the response times could be faster.\n\nWhat I like about Sage Intacct: The ease of setting up recurring invoices, handling multi-entity operations, and automating tedious tasks like reconciliations has reduced my workload. I barely have to think about those things anymore.\n\nI love how intuitive and user-friendly the interface is. It doesn\u2019t take much effort to figure out where everything is. What G2 users like about Sage Intacct: \u201cSage Intacct's accounting software helps in the end-to-end accounting process. I work in accounts payable, and its features of creating new vendors, extracting reports, and processing bills\u2014whether a single-currency bill or multi-currency bill\u2014are easy to understand and, once understood, easy to use. The feature of closing accounting books during the month-end helps our firm to maintain our records accurately.\u201d\n\n\n\nSage Intacct Review , Darshan J.\n\nWhat I dislike about Sage Intacct:\n\nSometimes, the system slows down when dealing with large datasets or running detailed reports.\n\nThe error messages could be more explicit. When something goes wrong, like an upload error, I often have to dig around to figure out the issue, which can get annoying.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about Sage Intacct:\n\n\u201cIn the Reporting section, we face several issues. For example, we cannot easily compare YTD to LYTD. Sometimes, contacting customer support is difficult as there\u2019s no proper chat service where we can report problems and get solutions quickly. Additionally, if the number of transactions is high, the software often crashes while exporting them. In the reports section, different reports sometimes show different balances, which creates confusion.\u201d\n\n\n\n- Sage Intacct Review, Pankaj P.\n\n3. QuickBooks Online\n\nI used QuickBooks Online for a while, and it's one of those tools that makes you think, \u2018Why didn't I start sooner?\u2019 at least until you run into a hiccup. More on that in a bit.\n\nThe inventory tracking feature is solid. It\u2019s not going to blow your mind if you\u2019re running a massive operation, but for our needs, it gets the job done. I did have to bring in a third-party app to handle some advanced stuff, but thankfully, QuickBooks Online integrates well with other tools. Everything just syncs up, from our bank accounts to credit cards.\n\nI also love how the automation feature auto-matches transactions. I don\u2019t have to sort every expense manually; QuickBooks does it for me. It even pulls in bank feeds and lets me reconcile accounts in minutes. Honestly, it feels like having an assistant who just gets it.\n\nThen there are the reports. I can whip up a profit-and-loss statement, export it to Excel, and send it off without sweating. Sure, the customization could be better, but it's handy for most of my needs. And let me just say the mobile app is my best friend. I\u2019ve sent invoices and checked our cash flow on the go.\n\n\n\nOne of our biggest wins has been the cloud-based setup. We can log in from home, the office, or even a random caf\u00e9. This has made managing our business less stressful, especially since we don\u2019t have to worry about losing files or manually syncing data.\n\n\n\nI also noticed some areas where QuickBooks Online could improve. For example, I can\u2019t always filter or adjust report customization fields how I\u2019d like, so I sometimes have to use workarounds.\n\nI\u2019ve also noticed the dashboard showing incorrect income or expense numbers more than once. I usually run detailed reports anyway, but it\u2019s still frustrating when I\u2019m in a hurry and just want a quick snapshot.\n\n\n\nThe pricing adds up, too. The base features are great, but you're looking at separate subscriptions once you need extras like payroll or TurboTax integration. We\u2019ve learned to budget for it, but it\u2019s something to remember if you\u2019re just starting.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve had a few moments with customer support where I was stuck on something simple and couldn\u2019t get enough help. It\u2019s not every time, but it\u2019s enough to make you grit your teeth when it happens.\n\nWhat I like about QuickBooks Online: We appreciate how seamlessly QuickBooks Online integrates with our bank accounts and credit cards. It automatically pulls in transactions and even matches them for us.\n\nThe automation features, like recurring invoices and reminders, save us time and help us manage our finances without extra effort. What G2 users like about QuickBooks Online: \u201cQuickBooks Online is user-friendly, and our clients love how easily accessible it is online since it is a cloud-based software. The accounting dashboard is simple and effective, and onboarding and adding new clients is a breeze. I use QuickBooks Online daily, and implementation with other software via the bank feed or GL mapping is seamless. I love the chat feature, and the customer support team is awesome.\u201d\n\n\n\nQuickBooks Online Review , Tiesha H.\n\nWhat I dislike about QuickBooks Online:\n\nI find the dashboard frustrating because it occasionally displays inaccurate income and expense summaries, forcing me to double-check with manual reports.\n\nI wish the platform allowed for more flexibility in customizing reports. Sometimes, I can\u2019t filter or format the data the way I need.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about QuickBooks Online:\n\n\u201cCustomer support is quite possibly the worst I have ever experienced, and unfortunately, I have had to use it many times. The agents have zero knowledge of the product or basic accounting understanding. Most of the time, I have to correct them on how the products function. One time, I had an issue that kept happening, and no one would fix it; they just continued to do a temporary fix, even though I would say this is the 2nd, this is the 3rd, 4th, 5th time, and I would explain to them that the prior person did the same thing and it's not permanent.\u201d\n\n\n\n- QuickBooks Online Review, Jonathan G.\n\nLooking for enterprise accounting software? Explore the best options.\n\n4. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise\n\nI like how QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise covers a lot of ground, from accounting to inventory management.\n\nThe software's inventory management capabilities are impressive. I can track items across multiple locations, manage serial and lot numbers, and use barcode scanning for efficient stock management. This level of control helps me maintain accurate inventory records and streamline operations.\n\n\n\nQuickBooks Desktop Enterprise offers editions tailored to various industries, such as manufacturing, construction, and retail. This customization provides features and reports designed specifically for our business sector, making the accounting software more relevant and valuable.\n\n\n\nThe integrated payroll system simplifies paying employees, handling taxes, and managing benefits. Having payroll seamlessly connected to our accounting data reduces errors and saves time.\n\n\n\nQuickBooks Desktop Enterprise also provides a wide range of customizable reports, allowing us to gain insights into various aspects of our business. The ability to create and modify reports helps us make informed decisions and strategic plans.\n\n\n\nWhile we appreciate that the software supports a variety of third-party integrations to enhance functionality, I\u2019ve noticed that many of these add-ons come with extra costs. Investing in these tools can stretch the budget as our business grows.\n\n\n\nAlthough I find QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise pretty user-friendly, I still wish more comprehensive training materials were available. It would make it easier to fully utilize all the features, especially when onboarding new team members.\n\n\n\nSince our business handles a lot of data, we\u2019ve encountered the issue of QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise's maximum file size limit of 1.5GB. Once you exceed that, performance can take a hit, which means we\u2019ve had to manage our files carefully or consider alternative solutions.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve also noticed that QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise limits the number of entries we can make in lists like customers, vendors, and items. For example, the Chart of Accounts is capped at 100,000 entries, which can be challenging if your business has extensive records like ours.\n\nWhat I like about QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise: I love how I can customize reports to get the necessary insights, whether tracking profitability or analyzing expenses.\n\nThe built-in payroll system simplifies paying our team and handling taxes. I love that it syncs directly with our accounting data, which reduces errors and prevents double entry. What G2 users like about QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise: \u201cQuickBooks Desktop Enterprise is straightforward for new users in my organization. It did not take much time for new employees to learn how to use the software.\u201d\n\n\n\nQuickBooks Desktop Enterprise Review , Linh V.\n\nWhat I dislike about QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise:\n\nOur business deals with large amounts of data, and the 1.5GB file size limit can be restrictive. Once we hit the limit, performance slows down, forcing me to spend time managing or splitting files.\n\nWhile the core features are great, the costs for upgrades or additional features can quickly increase. I feel these expenses can be excessive for growing businesses.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise:\n\n\u201cOne potential disadvantage of QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise is its higher cost than other versions of QuickBooks.\u201d\n\n\n\n- QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise Review, Jamila G.\n\n5. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central\n\nWhat sets Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central apart is how it centralizes all your accounting tasks. I\u2019ve found it incredibly convenient to manage the general ledger, accounts payable, receivables, and even fixed assets all in one place.\n\nOne of my favorite things is how seamlessly it works with Excel and Outlook. For example, you can pull real-time data into Excel for advanced calculations or send invoices directly through Outlook without hopping between apps. This integration feels natural if you're already a Microsoft user.\n\n\n\nI also love the accounts payable automation feature. We used to spend hours double-checking vendor payments, but with Dynamics 365, the system ensures accuracy and timeliness.\n\n\n\nI also appreciate the multi-currency support, which is helpful, especially if your business operates globally like ours. It handles exchange rates automatically, and the compliance features ensure you meet international accounting standards.\n\n\n\nI was also impressed by how easily Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central generates reports for profit and loss, cash flow, or even tax summaries. The customization options for these reports are good, and they have helped us make better financial decisions.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll be honest: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central isn\u2019t the kind of software you master overnight. When I first started using it, I was overwhelmed. The interface is dense, and understanding its full capabilities takes time. I had to invest in training, which slowed things down initially.\n\n\n\nSetting up the software was a project in itself for me. Configuring the general ledger and setting up workflows took much more effort than expected. If you don\u2019t have a tech-savvy team to lean on, you\u2019ll probably need to bring in some professional help to get everything running smoothly.\n\n\n\nWhile the backend functionality is robust, I\u2019ve found the user interface rigid. I wanted to personalize the dashboard and workflows, but the customization options were limited.\n\n\n\nSome processes aren\u2019t as user-friendly as I\u2019d hoped. For example, creating certain custom reports took way more effort than it should have. I had to search forums and tutorials to figure it out, which was frustrating when I just needed answers quickly.\n\nWhat I like about Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central: I love how it integrates perfectly with other Microsoft tools like Excel and Outlook, making tasks like importing data or sending invoices effortless.\n\nI appreciate how Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central allows me to generate detailed reports on cash flow, profit, and loss. What G2 users like about Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central: \u201cMicrosoft Dynamics 365 is an efficient financial platform with which you can record all your payments automatically and securely. It facilitates the management of your financial assets, allowing the visualization of each transaction your company executes. It is a perfect platform to digitize the accounting of your entire company, improving your productivity and financial efficiency.\u201d\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Review , Sandy T.\n\nWhat I dislike about Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central:\n\nFiguring out how to use the software effectively took way longer than I expected, and it initially felt overwhelming.\n\nI wish I could customize the dashboard and interface more to match the way I like to work.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central:\n\n\u201cIts learning curve process took me a while to learn how to use it quickly because I felt that it does not have the necessary tools to learn more quickly when it has never been used.\u201d\n\n\n\n- Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Review, Caroline B.\n\n6. Xero\n\nFrom day one, what struck me about Xero was how easy it is to set up and use. The interface feels intuitive, even if it could use a little refresh.\n\nI love the bank integration feature. Xero syncs directly with our accounts, pulling in transactions for quick reconciliation. It even uses bank rules to automate matching transactions, saving countless hours. Plus, their invoicing tools are top-notch. I can send professional invoices, set up recurring ones, and automate reminders, so we are not chasing payments anymore.\n\n\n\nCloud accessibility is another huge win. I can access everything seamlessly from my desk, phone, or tablet halfway across the world. And if you\u2019re into automation like I am, Xero\u2019s API opens up a world of integrations for inventory, budgeting, and more.\n\n\n\nPayroll works well for the most part, but it\u2019s not perfect. I don\u2019t like how certain regions don\u2019t have full payroll support yet, so you might need workarounds depending on where you\u2019re based. Multi-currency handling could also use some love; expense reporting feels limited when juggling currencies.\n\n\n\nI also appreciate Xero\u2019s security features. I feel confident that my data is protected with two-factor authentication and encrypted connections, which is a big deal for me, especially with sensitive financial data.\n\nXero\u2019s reporting tools are decent but could be more customizable for tracking multiple locations or generating advanced financial insights. I also wish their support team was faster; it\u2019s email-based, so you'll need patience if something urgent arises. While the system automates a lot, intricate processes like multi-currency setups or splitting invoices can feel clunky.\n\nWhat I like about Xero: Xero\u2019s interface is so intuitive that I figured most things out without much effort.\n\nFeatures like recurring invoices and bank rules do the repetitive work for us. It\u2019s like having a virtual assistant for my accounting. What G2 users like about Xero: \u201cThe Software is straightforward to use. Initially, the implementation was a bit hard, but the support helped us get used to it. I have been using this software for 5 years. The Inventory module and Fixed asset module are the best ones. Integration without a dashboard is easy.\u201d\n\n\n\nXero Review , Syed Y.\n\nWhat I dislike about Xero:\n\nWhen I have an issue, I must email their support and wait.\n\nPayroll and multi-currency handling aren\u2019t fully supported everywhere, which can be annoying if you need those.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about Xero:\n\n\"We also utilize XPM as our CRM. When generating tasks in XPM, having the whole chart of accounts available in the income account drop-down box would be useful. Sometimes tasks or expenditures must be coded back into an expense or COG account.\u201d\n\n\n\n- Xero Review, Pramod K.\n\nKeen to learn how to maintain ethics in accounting?

Intuit QuickBooks\n\nWhen I started using Intuit QuickBooks for my accounting needs, I didn\u2019t know I was signing up for an accounting software that could do so much.\n\nIntuit QuickBooks makes it ridiculously easy to track expenses. Whether categorizing payments or managing recurring bills, everything feels intuitive and efficient. I also like the customizable reports for cash flow analysis, profitability tracking, or generating tax summaries with just a few clicks.\n\n\n\nI love how Intuit QuickBooks takes the grunt work out of accounting, from recurring invoicing to automated tax calculations. It\u2019s perfect for meeting deadlines without breaking a sweat. I also appreciate how this accounting software effortlessly connects with other tools I use, like PayPal and Shopify.\n\n\n\nThe built-in inventory tools work well for smaller operations, but if you\u2019re scaling up, you might need additional integrations.\n\nI dislike occasional glitches, like issues with payroll setup or miscategorized expenses. These hiccups can be annoying when you\u2019re in a rush. Some features, like advanced inventory management or complex analytics, aren\u2019t as robust as I\u2019d like. I had to rely on third-party apps for those.\n\n\n\nIntuit QuickBooks is perfect for small to medium businesses, but larger enterprises might find it lacking in depth and scalability. I also didn\u2019t like how resolving errors wasn\u2019t always straightforward. For instance, one payroll error took several back-and-forths with support to fix.\n\nWhat I like about Intuit QuickBooks: I love how Intuit QuickBooks makes it easy to track and categorize expenses.\n\nI also appreciate the smart reporting tools that let me customize reports to show what we need, whether profit and loss, cash flow, or tax summaries. What G2 users like about Intuit QuickBooks: \u201cYou just need strong accounting and finance knowledge and leave the rest on Intuit QuickBooks. It can generate comprehensive reports in a single click and provide you the required data in a very short span with errors.\u201d\n\n\n\nIntuit QuickBooks Review , Mahinder V.\n\nWhat I dislike about Intuit QuickBooks:\n\nSome features, like detailed inventory management, feel underdeveloped. I\u2019ve had to use third-party tools to fill the gaps.\n\nWhen issues arise, resolving them through customer support can be a hassle, which wastes time.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about Intuit QuickBooks:\n\n\u201cI think the part I disliked the most is the price. It costs the company more to use than our new payroll service. Customer Support wasn't the best either.\u201d\n\n\n\n- Intuit QuickBooks Review, Bobbi H.\n\n8. FreshBooks\n\nAs a freelancer or small business owner, you must juggle invoices and expenses to keep your accounts in order. That\u2019s where FreshBooks comes in. It\u2019s an all-in-one accounting software that doesn\u2019t make me feel like I need a finance degree to use it.\n\nCreating invoices used to feel like a chore, but FreshBooks makes it ridiculously simple. I can whip up professional-looking invoices with our logo, brand colors, and custom payment terms in minutes. Plus, features like recurring invoices, automated reminders, and late fee calculations mean I don\u2019t have to nag clients\u2014it does it for me!\n\n\n\nI also love FreshBooks\u2019 time-tracking tool for billing clients by the hour. I just start the timer while I work, and those hours are automatically added when it\u2019s time to invoice. No more guessing or accidentally shortchanging myself.\n\n\n\nI also appreciate how the expense tracking feature lets me import expenses directly from my bank account and categorize them so tax time isn\u2019t a nightmare. Oh, and if you work with international clients, it supports multiple currencies, too.\n\n\n\nI was also impressed with the report feature, which generates profit margins, tax summaries, and expense breakdowns in a way I can understand. I also love how all our client info is in one place: contact details, payment history, and project notes; it\u2019s all there.\n\n\n\nFreshBooks integrates with Stripe and PayPal and even supports ACH bank transfers and credit cards. Clients can pay directly through the invoice, which is super convenient. That said, processing payments can take a little while, which has sometimes been frustrating.\n\n\n\nI started with just me, so this wasn\u2019t an issue initially. But when I considered bringing someone else on board, I realized that each additional user costs extra. If you\u2019re scaling up, it\u2019s something to think about.\n\n\n\nWhile it\u2019s great for basic accounting, it lacks certain features, like check-writing or more complex accounting tools. You might feel these limitations more if you\u2019re running a larger operation.\n\n\n\nI get it\u2014security is important. But verifying the same information over and over gets old fast. It feels like FreshBooks could streamline this a bit.\n\n\n\nI have a lot of repeat time entries, and manually re-entering them can get tedious. I wish there was a smarter way to automate this process.\n\nWhat I like about FreshBooks: The built-in time tracker is a lifesaver. I just hit start when I begin working and stop when I\u2019m done. It links directly to my invoices, so I never miss billing a single hour.\n\nKeeping track of expenses is straightforward. I can snap pictures of receipts, import transactions from my bank, and categorize everything for tax time. What G2 users like about FreshBooks: \u201cPlanning invoices and making my reports are two of FreshBooks' most appealing features. Even individuals without an accounting background find its user interface straightforward and simple, making financial management a joy. In addition to keeping track of spending, I am adept at managing invoices and generating financial reports; our company has also successfully performed sales tax computations. I enjoy how you can sync your bank transactions to always know when your accounts are up-to-date. The most time-saving feature is the ability to collect payments immediately from the invoice.\u201d\n\n\n\nFreshBooks Review , Vasyl T.\n\nWhat I dislike about FreshBooks:\n\nWhile I appreciate the multiple payment options for clients, the lag time to receive my funds is frustrating. I wish they could speed up this process.\n\nFreshBooks works great for solo entrepreneurs. However, the cost of adding additional users seemed quite steep when I considered including a team member.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about FreshBooks:\n\n\u201cI got bumped up to the middle tier too soon. Just because I have six clients doesn't mean my business is out of the woods yet. I am still trying to make it sustainable, and the fee jump was a bummer.\u201d\n\n\n\n- FreshBooks Review, Chris A.\n\n9. SAP S/4HANA Cloud\n\nI liked testing SAP S/4HANA Cloud for managing finances.\n\n\n\nWhat I love most about it is how it handles real-time financial insights. Whether I\u2019m reviewing transactions or generating reports, the system delivers accurate and up-to-date data. It\u2019s perfect for making quick decisions without second-guessing.\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite features is the centralized data management. All vendor data, detailed ledgers, and transactions are in one place, making it simple to track and analyze. The interface is intuitive, and the software \"gets\" what I need. Its financial intelligence also resolves issues and processes transactions faster than anything I\u2019ve used before.\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about speed and intelligence. SAP S/4HANA Cloud shines when it comes to comprehensive financial management. It organizes our company\u2019s financial situation into a single, user-friendly interface, helping us analyze the big picture. I also appreciate the security and compliance features, which help us maintain data integrity.\n\n\n\nNow, for the not-so-great parts. Payroll can be a pain. Setting it up is a complex process, and even routine tasks sometimes feel overly complicated. I\u2019ve also had moments where reports took longer to generate than I\u2019d like, with occasional glitches. And if you\u2019re integrating finance with other areas, like operations, expect some tricky backend processes.\n\n\n\nSupport is another area where SAP could step up. While most issues are manageable, I\u2019ve sometimes needed more robust help to resolve bugs or complaints.\n\nWhat I like about SAP S/4HANA Cloud: I love how SAP S/4HANA Cloud provides up-to-the-minute financial data, allowing me to make decisions quickly without waiting for batch updates or manual reports.\n\nAll my vendor data, detailed ledgers, and transactions are in one place, making it easy to manage and analyze finances without jumping between multiple systems. What G2 users like about SAP S/4HANA Cloud: \u201cSAP S/4 HANA Cloud solution allows users to run SAP throughout on standard functionality. No customisation is needed as standard functionality fulfills all user requirements. Secondly, the multiples tables are consolidated in order one table, for example, acedoca for finance and Matdoc for goods receipt.\u201d\n\n\n\nSAP S/4HANA Cloud Review , Maaz A.\n\nWhat I dislike about SAP S/4HANA Cloud:\n\nSometimes, reports take longer than expected to generate, and I\u2019ve encountered occasional glitches in the data, which can be frustrating.\n\nIntegrating financial data with other operational systems sometimes feels overly complex, especially when dealing with cross-functional processes.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about SAP S/4HANA Cloud:\n\n\u201cThe system is very expensive because it offers many functions and applications, which makes its price level very high. Not everyone can get it and must opt for a lower plan with fewer options so that more companies can afford it. SAP is a bit more complex as its interface is difficult to understand and requires some work as it is not very easy to implement. Its initial configuration usually has to be done by professionals, and the cost is high; not everyone can use it, which wastes time and increases business costs.\u201d\n\n\n\n- SAP S/4HANA Cloud Review, Lazi Z.\n\n10. Acumatica\n\nAcumatica feels like having the ultimate toolkit for managing my business finances. It\u2019s flexible, powerful, and surprisingly intuitive.\n\nOne of the best things about Acumatica is how customizable it is. I can tweak workflows, create custom dashboards, and set up financial reports precisely the way I need them. Whether I\u2019m managing invoices, reconciling accounts, or analyzing costs, the software feels like it bends to my business rather than the other way around.\n\n\n\nGone are the days of waiting for end-of-month reports to determine our financial standing. With Acumatica, I get real-time access to my data, no matter where I am. It\u2019s all cloud-based, so whether I\u2019m at my desk or checking in from my phone while traveling, I always have the latest numbers at my fingertips.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not a tech genius, but Acumatica doesn\u2019t make me feel like I need to be one. The interface is clean and intuitive, which made onboarding my team way less painful than I expected. It\u2019s straightforward and doesn\u2019t overwhelm me with unnecessary features.\n\n\n\nIntegration is seamless. I\u2019ve connected it to my CRM, inventory management tools, and third-party payment platforms. Everything in my business talks to each other now, saving me so much time and frustration.\n\n\n\nThe flexibility I love comes with a learning curve. Setting everything up exactly how I wanted it took time\u2014and, honestly, some outside help. It\u2019s ultimately worth it, but it\u2019s not an out-of-the-box solution.\n\n\n\nNow and then, I\u2019ve run into glitches, like trouble with vendor/customer balance handling or email features. They\u2019re not deal-breakers but can be annoying when you\u2019re in the middle of something important.\n\n\n\nAcumatica isn\u2019t cheap. Between the licensing and implementation, it\u2019s an investment. For me, the scalability and long-term value made it worth it, but if you\u2019re on a tight budget, it\u2019s something to consider.\n\nWhat I like about Acumatica: I love how flexible Acumatica is. Whether creating custom reports or setting up workflows tailored to my business, I feel like I\u2019m in control.\n\nHaving real-time financial data at my fingertips is a game-changer. I don\u2019t have to wait for reports or second-guess where I stand. What G2 users like about Acumatica: \u201cI'm in the finance department, and I love the functionality of navigating from a sales order to drill down directly to the GL that I'm working on or vice versa. It makes it so much simpler to find answers. I'm just scratching the surface on harnessing the data with personalized GIs, but I'm excited about what I've learned at Summit 2024. There is so much data there that I'm just beginning to learn.\u201d\n\n\n\nAcumatica Review , Matt R.\n\nWhat I dislike about Acumatica:\n\nCustomizing everything to fit my needs wasn\u2019t as straightforward as I hoped. It took time, and I even had to bring in outside help to get it right. It was worth it, but not exactly plug-and-play.\n\nOccasionally, I\u2019ve run into hiccups, like trouble managing vendor/customer balances or issues with email functionality. They\u2019re not deal-breakers, but they can be frustrating.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about Acumatica:\n\n\u201cFixed Assets module can be improved in terms of functionality and reporting. I wish more can be done for the fuel distribution industry.\u201d\n\n\n\n- Acumatica Review, Darren F.\n\n11. FloQast\n\nIf you\u2019re in accounting, you\u2019ve probably heard about FloQast. I\u2019ve been using it for a while now, and I love how this cloud-based accounting software is built specifically for accountants by accountants, and it shows in every little detail.\n\nFloQast makes our month-end close process so much easier. It streamlines everything with automated workflows, centralized task lists, and a close status dashboard that gives us a real-time view of where things stand. The checklist management feature keeps us organized by breaking down complex processes into manageable steps. No more scrambling through spreadsheets or remembering what\u2019s next on our to-do list.\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite features is the seamless integration with popular ERP systems like NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics GP, QuickBooks, and tools like Excel. The integration is so smooth that you can sync reconciliations, track variances, and review documentation without manually moving data. Plus, read-only access ensures the integrity of your financial data while allowing teams to collaborate efficiently.\n\n\n\nThe reconciliation management feature deserves a shoutout, too. It rolls forward reconciliations from one period to the next, saving our team hours of repetitive work. In addition, the Flux Analysis tool helps us pinpoint and analyze variances. I also love the audit-ready PBC lists, which help auditors access files directly, cutting down the back-and-forth emails during audit season.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve found FloQast\u2019s document storage system to be a bit clunky at times. Navigating through older files or tracking specific ones can feel like solving a puzzle. While integrating major ERP systems like NetSuite and QuickBooks is fantastic, I can see how users working with smaller or more niche ERPs might wish for better support.\n\n\n\nThe customization options are also limited. Setting up unique workflows or adjusting views to fit specific team roles is not always easy. Furthermore, if you\u2019re dealing with high transaction volumes or managing multiple entities, you might notice a slight dip in performance.\n\n\n\nI\u2019d love to see improved filtering and search functionality, especially in the Task Management and Reconciliation Modules. Sometimes, I feel like digging through a haystack to find what I need.\n\nWhat I like about FloQast: I love how FloQast simplifies my month-end close process with automated workflows and a real-time status dashboard.\n\nIntegrating tools like NetSuite, QuickBooks, and Excel is a game-changer. The data syncs effortlessly, so I don\u2019t waste time manually importing or exporting it. What G2 users like about FloQast: \u201cFloQast makes it easy to track all the deliverables of the close process and keep everyone connected to the process. It helps with collaboration, too. It's great having review controls for journal entries and reconciliations all in one place. We are also working with their Remind product to help automate some of our close steps, which we expect will help reduce close time. We can also share access with our auditors so they can review whatever support they need during audits. The FloQast support team has been helpful, and I like their short educational videos that help me quickly get up to speed on different features. It's very easy to use and implement.\u201d\n\n\n\nFloQast Review , Raquel P.\n\nWhat I dislike about FloQast:\n\nI wish there were more options to customize workflows or views for different roles in my team. Sometimes, it feels like I\u2019m stuck working within rigid templates.\n\nThe search and filtering capabilities are basic, especially in the Task Management and Reconciliation Modules. It can feel like I\u2019m wasting time hunting for things that should be easier to locate.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about FloQast:\n\n\u201cI don't like the document storage system. Documents can either be in the folders or the file storage location. Documents created directly in the file storage location are not reflected in the documents section of the folder. I also can't claim ownership of the file storage system, and no one has been able to help me with this.\u201d\n\n\n\n- FloQast Review, Maxine A.\n\nAccounting software: Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\n1.

Explore the top three questions that surfaced with tips to tackle them for success.\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nBalancing priorities has always been part of entrepreneurship, but 2025 brings unique challenges for business owners looking to grow. According to Intuit QuickBook's recent entrepreneurship report, growth and expansion are top priorities for small business owners in 2025. Despite these priorities, inflation continues to weigh on business growth while rising demand for digital and ecommerce reshapes how businesses compete.\n\nThe survey of 3,000 business owners and consumers in the U.S. unpacked the top questions on the minds of small business owners, revealing insights and trends that are helpful to entrepreneurs at any stage of their business. Here are the top three questions that surfaced with tips to tackle them for success.\n\nRelated: Small Business Owners Lose an Average of 7 Hours of Sleep Per Week \u2014 Here's What's Causing It\n\n1. How can I grow my business despite ongoing inflation?\n\nInflation hits small businesses hard because they often lack the resources or cash reserves that larger companies have. Small business growth has declined in the past 12 months, with revenue declining by an average of $11,850 per small business, according to the 2025 Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index Annual Report. Between rising costs and loss in revenue, entrepreneurs are facing tough decisions this year \u2014 35% of business owners plan to increase prices next year, while others seek creative ways to reduce expenses.\n\nInflation doesn't have to stall growth if you have the right strategies to get ahead of it:\n\nLook critically at where you're spending your money: Start by thoroughly auditing your expenses. Look for costs to trim, like switching to a more affordable office space or finding new shipping resources to lower delivery fees. Categorizing expenses into \"essential\" and \"non-essential\" can help prioritize what matters most. Consider using expense-tracking software to eliminate manual errors and keep a real-time view of your cash flow. Diversify revenue streams: The report showed that 32% of business owners plan to diversify their revenue streams to stay afloat. For example, a local fitness studio may begin offering virtual workout programs or sell branded activewear online. Working with an accountant or financial advisor can help you identify which revenue streams make the most sense for your business, analyzing cash flow statements and balance sheets to give you the insights you need to make informed decisions. Look for new ways to partner for efficiencies: Some businesses use partnerships and connections to cut shipping costs and improve efficiency. For example, a local coffee shop could negotiate bulk discounts with a nearby bean roaster, or two clothing designers could collaborate to share fabric costs for their garments. According to the report, 37% of small businesses are poised to explore new ways to source products and materials.\n\n2. How can I stay competitive as more customers shop online?\n\nOnline shopping has become the preferred way to shop, and small businesses are racing to meet the demand. Whether a business sells products or offers specialized services, meeting customers online is critical to stay competitive. In 2025, 35% plan to invest in expanding ecommerce offerings, and 71% already operate online to some degree.\n\nTo grow online sales, start with the basics:\n\nCreate a smooth checkout experience: Customers demand easy purchase options, which is why 64% of business owners prefer online payment platforms, and 56% already use digital systems to drive sales. Consider investing in shopping cart software that integrates with your site, supports popular payments via credit card, payment apps or other gateways, and ensures a secure, user-friendly experience. Service-based businesses can also benefit from using scheduling software that allows clients to book and pay online, ensuring a seamless, end-to-end shopping journey. Invest in analytics: To take your ecommerce shop to the next level, use analytics tools to track customer behavior, product trends and market demand. AI-driven platforms can simplify complex data, making it actionable for small businesses without hiring a dedicated team. Meet customers where they are: Consider how you're staying connected with your audience digitally. Email campaigns, social media and SMS marketing are affordable options to keep customers engaged and informed.\n\n3. Should I leverage my entrepreneurial expertise to start a side hustle?\n\nA side hustle is a lower-risk way to test new business ideas or add an additional revenue stream. For many small business owners, it's a smart strategy for building financial resilience during uncertain economic times. In fact, starting a new side hustle has become the top wealth-building strategy for small business owners, outranking financial investments. Nearly 33% of our survey respondents plan to start a side hustle in 2025, with 43% of business owners splitting their time between multiple jobs to boost their revenue.\n\nUse what you have: Owning an established business is a valuable resource for starting a new project. Choose a hustle that complements the expertise, assets and customer relationships that are already established. For example, a bakery owner could open a shared commercial kitchen to rent to other food entrepreneurs or write a signature cookbook. According to the survey, 71% of respondents are keeping their current job, and nearly 1 in 4 use their current job as a launchpad to build their passion project. Keep startup costs low: Start small with opportunities that require minimal investment. Freelancing, online marketplaces or service-based add-ons can provide an easy entry point. Tracking revenue and expenses from the start will help you stay on top of finances from different sources and scale when your side hustle takes off. Master time management: Balancing multiple commitments is no easy feat. Automation tools like scheduling apps or expense trackers can help entrepreneurs stay organized and focused.\n\nRelated: Side Hustles Are Soaring as Entrepreneurs Start Businesses Working Part- or Full-Time Elsewhere, According to a New Report\n\nWhat are your goals for entrepreneurship in 2025?\n\nMaintaining a successful business may sound daunting, but small, consistent actions can lead to big wins. The great news is that you don't have to navigate it alone. With the right tools and professional guidance \u2014 like a bookkeeper or certified accountant \u2014 you can make confident, informed decisions to set your business up for success in 2025 and beyond.",

            "content": "INGLEWOOD \u2014 Time is running down for the Clippers to make a playoff push. They have 18 regular-season games left to figure out their team chemistry, get healthy and move up in the Western Conference standings. It\u2019s a big ask, but James Harden believes, with his help and some outside factors, the Clippers have a chance to secure a playoff spot and avoid the Play-In Tournament.\n\nSunday night\u2019s overtime win against the Sacramento Kings was the next step forward, Harden said. It was the team\u2019s third consecutive victory after their sixth three-game losing streak of the season.\n\nFirst, though, the Clippers need a full roster. Injuries to Norman Powell (hamstring) and Ben Simmons (knee) and a minutes restriction on Kawhi Leonard have hampered their recent efforts to stay within the top six teams in the West. Neither Powell nor Simmons are expected to join the team on their three-game trip that begins Tuesday at the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nIn less than a week, the Clippers (35-29) dropped from sixth place to their current No. 8, and sixth-place Golden State (36-28) \u2013 11-2 since Jimmy Butler\u2019s debut \u2013 is threatening to distance itself from the pack. Teams that finish 7-10 compete for the final two spots in the eight-team playoff bracket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s forming the way it needs to form,\u201d Harden said. \u201cHopefully in the near future we get Norman (Powell) back and we get Ben (Simmons) back, and we get a full roster, making a playoff pitch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to do something special with this team, but we haven\u2019t had that yet this year. So, I think that\u2019s the most exciting part, that Kawhi is fully healthy. He played 40 minutes tonight, and our team, we have a lot of depth and a lot of guys who can play multiple positions and do a lot of different things on both ends of the ball.\u201d\n\nAnd Harden finds that exciting and promising and time pressing.\n\n\u201cWe still gotta keep pushing away. I think they said we got 19 games left and every game is crucial for real,\u201d he said.\n\nON THE INJURED LIST\n\nCoach Tyronn Lue stiffly stepped off the interview platform before Sunday\u2019s victory, the only hint that something was bothering him. He didn\u2019t say anything about experiencing back pain or that he would not be on the bench.\n\nYet, shortly before tipoff, the team announced that Lue had gone home because of discomfort and would be replaced by assistant Brian Shaw. There wasn\u2019t clear after the game whether Lue would accompany the team on their three-game trip.\n\n\u201cTy is tough as nails, and for him to sit out a game you know it has to be something that is really, really bothering him,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cSo, we were in constant communication with him throughout the game and the guys, they stayed with it tonight in a game that was tough.\u201d\n\nShaw said the coaches talked to Lue on FaceTime after the game and felt a pang of concern for their head coach.\n\n\u201cHe was watching at home \u2026 and he looked like he was having a heart attack feeling the same way that we felt out there not knowing how it was going to go,\u201d Shaw said of a game they won, 111-110, when Leonard\u2019s overtime buzzer-beater bounced in. \u201cBut he was happy for us and we\u2019re all wishing that the pain that he\u2019s dealing with in his back goes away and we can get back ASAP.\u201d\n\nCLIPPERS AT PELICANS\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 5 p.m. PT\n\nWhere: Smoothie King Center, New Orleans\n\nTV/radio: KTLA (Ch. 5)/570 AM",

            "content": "The Clippers had every reason to fall apart on Sunday. But no, they survived the Kings\u2019 wild attacks at the Intuit Dome. And they did it all without their head coach, Ty Lue. Before the showdown, Lue had left the arena because of his back pain, handing over his responsibilities to assistant coach Brian Shaw. And most comfortably, he took the coaching seat on the sideline. But despite all the chaos and the last-minute changes, the Clippers kept their cool. They made it work, stepped up, and pulled off a dramatic clutch overtime win that not many saw coming. And while the action was getting intense on the court, Lue was hardly able to watch the drama unfold.\n\nWell, for Shaw, the responsibility wasn\u2019t limited to securing a win; he had to take up the media responsibility. Just like Lue, the stop-gap coach also won over the media with his perfect comic timing while facing hard-hitting questions. It was revealed the final play of the game involving Kawhi Leonard was indeed a call from Lue, who was in constant communication with the coaches. And in turn, it also disclosed the condition the Clippers HC was in. \u201cHe was talking to a couple of the other coaches. He was watching at home. They FaceTimed him after the game was over, and he looked like he was having a heart attack, feeling the same way that we felt out there, not knowing how it was going to go,\u201d the interim coach said during the post-game press conference.\n\nThe final moments of the Kings vs Clippers weren\u2019t for the faint-hearted, that\u2019s for sure. With 6 seconds left in overtime, Kawhi received the ball and drove to the paint. All five of the Kings\u2019 players converged on him, but his floater bounced on the rim twice before finally dropping in, sparking a wild celebration at the Intuit Dome.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nvia Imago Image Credits: Imagn\n\n\u201cBut he was happy for us, and we\u2019re just, we\u2019re all wishing that the pain that he\u2019s dealing with in his back goes away, and we can get him back ASAP,\u201d Shaw further added. There has been no official update on Ty Lue\u2019s situation as of the time of writing. But Shaw made sure to ease some nerves by giving an overview of the situation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nMore details of Ty Lue\u2019s unexpected back pain emerge\n\nThis is the second time this season that a health issue has ruled out a head coach before the game. Gregg Popovich\u2019s situation with the Spurs was much more severe and concerning. Ty Lue, on the other hand, has back pain. He even attended the pre-game media duties only to be ruled out an hour before the start of the game, and he was indeed in some pain.\n\n\u201c[Lue was] In some pain, his back is bothering him. Ty is tough as nails, and for him to sit out a game, it has to be something that\u2019s really, really bothering him,\u201d Shaw explained in the presser. He highlighted his constant communication with the HC during the game and, just like Lue\u2019s pain tolerance, it was a game for the Clippers to persevere.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nWith the 111-110 win, the Clippers moved into 1 game behind the Timberwolves and the Warriors, who currently occupy the 7th and 6th seeds, respectively. On Tuesday, the LAC will begin a three-game road trip facing the Pelicans, Heat, and Hawks, wrapping it up on Friday before returning to the Dome. With Lue\u2019s situation still up in the air, Shaw just might have to grit his teeth in his new role to keep the ship steady on the road to the playoffs.",

And this isn\u2019t just any role player we\u2019re talking about\u2014Powell is the Clippers\u2019 leading scorer this season, despite playing just 46 games.\n\nTo make matters worse, Sacramento is one of his favorite teams to torch. Powell has averaged 31 points against the Kings this season, shooting a scorching 55.6% from deep. Unfortunately for LA, they\u2019ll have to wait for another chance to see Stormin\u2019 Norman light up Sacramento.\n\nThe other name on the Clippers\u2019 injury list? Ben Simmons. The guard has now missed four straight games due to a lingering knee issue, officially ruling him out against Sacramento. And for Simmons, this feels all too familiar.\n\nInjuries have overshadowed his NBA career, making headlines just as much\u2014if not more\u2014than his performances on the court. A year ago, he underwent back surgery that sidelined him indefinitely, another frustrating chapter in his battle to stay healthy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nHe just played 33 game for the Nets before they waived him off in Feb. He subsequently got picked up by the Clippers, being a decent value addition for Tyronn Lue.\n\nvia Imago Image Credits: Imagn\n\nPatrick Baldwin Jr., Cam Christie, Seth Lundy, and Trentyn Flowers are also out due to their two-way commitments. That being said, this is their predicted lineup for the Kings clash:\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nPoint Guard James Harden Shooting Guard Kris Dunn Power Forward Kawhi Leonard Small Forward Amir Coffey Center Ivica Zubac\n\nThe Clippers need this more than anything. They lose against the Kings, and they\u2019re suddenly 9th. They\u2019re banking hard on Kawhi Leonard to step up like he usually does.",

Similar to their first bout, Fiziev started strong, surprising with two early takedowns and sharp striking, but Gaethje took control in the second round, dropping him with a powerful uppercut.\n\nWith the fight likely tied, Fiziev opened the third with aggressive kicks, but Gaethje\u2019s steady pressure and heavy shots sealed the victory. Now 2-0 against Fiziev, Gaethje reaffirms his place in the lightweight Top 5 and the former BMF champion remains one of the division\u2019s most dangerous contenders.\n\nPerformance Of The Night Bonuses\n\nPerformance Of The Night: Mauricio Ruffy\n\nMauricio Ruffy wasted no time making a statement at UFC 313, delivering a highlight reel knockout that will be replayed for years to come. Facing the seasoned King Green in his 50th professional fight, Ruffy landed a crisp right hand that caught Green\u2019s attention, leading to a perfectly timed spinning wheel kick that shut the lightweights lights out at 2:07 of Round 1.\n\nWith one of the best knockouts we\u2019ve seen so far, Ruffy improved to 3-0 in the UFC and continues his rapid rise up the 155 pound ladder. This performance not only solidified his place as a serious contender but also added to the growing legacy of the Fighting Nerds camp. If there were any doubts about Ruffy\u2019s potential, he silenced them with one spectacular kick tonight.\n\nPerformance Of The Night: Ignacio Bahamondes\n\nIgnacio Bahamondes scored the biggest win of his UFC career at UFC 313, submitting Jalin Turner with a slick triangle choke at 2:29 of Round 1. Known for his striking, Bahamondes showed off his ground skills after being taken down, staying active from the bottom before locking in the fight-ending submission.\n\nThe victory marks his third straight finish and sixth win in seven fights, solidifying his case for a spot in the lightweight Top 15. With his evolving skill set and rising momentum, Bahamondes is quickly becoming a serious contender in the division.\n\nAttendance: 18,869 (sold out)\n\nGate: $10.1 million",

The associated price target remains the same with $726.00.\n\nSteve Enders has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that highlight Intuit\u2019s potential for growth. One of the key reasons is the improving pace of tax filings, which indicates a robust close to the tax season. The IRS data shows a steady catch-up in filing activity compared to the previous year, suggesting that Intuit\u2019s products, such as TurboTax, are maintaining their relevance and demand among users.\n\nAdditionally, the report notes that while overall tax filings are slightly down year-over-year, they are still ahead of historical averages, which is a positive indicator for Intuit\u2019s performance. The consistent trend in e-filings and self-prepared e-filings, which are closely associated with Intuit\u2019s offerings, further supports the expectation of a positive shift in year-over-year volumes. With an expected share price return of 19.1%, these factors collectively contribute to the Buy rating for Intuit\u2019s stock.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, Enders is an analyst with an average return of -1.1% and a 50.72% success rate. Enders covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as Intuit, Workiva, and BlackLine.\n\nIn another report released on March 6, KeyBanc also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $770.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Analysts are intrested in these 5 stocks: ( (PLTR) ), ( (GOLD) ), ( (INTU) ), ( (NTLA) ) and ( (BYON) ). Here is a breakdown of their recent ratings and the rationale behind them.\n\nPalantir Technologies has been upgraded to a \u2018Hold\u2019 by analyst Louie Dipalma, who sees potential in the company\u2019s AI pipeline despite a recent 33% selloff. The stock\u2019s valuation remains high, but positive developments, such as government contract opportunities and a rich U.S. government pipeline, offer hope. Palantir\u2019s platforms, Foundry/AIP and Advana, are expected to benefit from a new executive order. However, the stock is expected to remain volatile, with potential downside risks due to government contract delays.\n\nBarrick Gold has been upgraded to \u2018Buy\u2019 by analyst Daniel Major, who sees a value opportunity following the stock\u2019s underperformance. The company is trading at a discount compared to its peers, and a potential restart of its Mali mines could act as a positive catalyst. Barrick\u2019s medium-term copper growth and projects in high-risk jurisdictions could create significant shareholder value. The stock is valued at $22 per share, based on its EV/EBITDA ratio.\n\nIntuit has been upgraded to \u2018Buy\u2019 by analyst Mark Murphy, who sees the company\u2019s underperformance as an attractive entry point. Despite challenges, Intuit has continued to innovate and maintain strong business fundamentals. The QuickBooks franchise is particularly strong, with positive customer feedback and a high likelihood of recommendation. Intuit\u2019s scale and commitment to innovation are seen as positive factors, and the stock is valued at $660 per share.\n\nIntellia Therapeutics has initiated coverage with a \u2018Buy\u2019 rating by analyst Mitchell Kapoor, who sees potential in the company\u2019s CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Intellia\u2019s lead asset, NTLA-2002, offers a one-time treatment option for hereditary angioedema, with promising early data. The company\u2019s second asset, Nex-Z, shows potential for treating transthyretin amyloidosis. Intellia is seen as undervalued, with important data updates expected in 2025.\n\nBeyond Inc has been downgraded to \u2018Hold\u2019 by analyst Bernie Mcternan due to a significant reduction in revenue estimates. While management has improved cost efficiency, the path to profitability is now expected to be more volatile, with adjusted EBITDA-positive status pushed out to 2027. The stock\u2019s risk-reward profile is seen as less favorable, leading to the downgrade.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

His remarks built on an earlier show, where he had shared that \u201cyou can\u2019t make money listening to a billionaire because they already have made money.\u201d\n\nThis time around, Cramer outlined that billionaires often share the sentiment that it\u2019s hard for others to become as rich as they are. \u201cThey close the door,\u201d he commented and added: \u201cWell they\u2019re always negative.\u201d Cramer also believes that luck might play a large role in making someone a billionaire. According to him: \u201cWe never, we never grade them because if they\u2019re billionaires we think that they have to be genius. We never think about luck. We just think, well they might have had really great trade.\u201d\n\nIn response, co-host David Faber pointed out that the one key trait that he has observed in most billionaires is their relentless drive. Cramer responded by sharing that billionaires are \u201ctiresome.\u201d He also felt that President Biden\u2019s goodbye speech about oligarchs was \u201ccompletely ignored.\u201d\n\nDuring the show, Cramer also commented on how using ChatGPT was proving troublesome. He outlined:\n\n\u201cI use ChatGPT like, probably maybe fifty times a day. I do it text and I\u2019m continually let down by the lack of rigor of what I get. I mean I\u2019ll say tell me everything I need to know about [a pharma company \u2013 BMY]. And it won\u2019t even have the patent cliff. Doesn\u2019t mention the patent. . . I mean it just doesn\u2019t get the story at all.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 26th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",

Sporting a stylish black turtleneck and blue-red jacket, he chatted with fans while his wife Michelle\u2019s absence sparked rumors. Meanwhile, James Harden exploded for 50 points in a thrilling win. Yet, it was Obama\u2019s now-iconic \u2018thinking pose\u2019 that had NBA fans talking long after the final buzzer.Rocking a black turtleneck with a blue and red jacket, Obama looked super cheerful as he chatted with fans and team staff. His wife, Michelle, was noticeably missing, which has sparked some speculation about their relationship.But despite the buzz, the Obamas shared sweet messages on Valentine's Day, showing they\u2019re still a solid team. Meanwhile, Clippers guard James Harden had an amazing game, dropping 50 points for the first time since joining the squad, helping the Clippers snag a 123-115 win over the Pistons.He jokingly said that Obama\u2019s presence was the secret to his success, quipping, \"He's probably the reason I played so well.\"Obama's timing was perfect given the political instability. President Trump had an intense seated discussion at the White House with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. The conference descended into a back-and-forth of charges, particularly over Russia's aggressiveness toward Ukraine. Not holding back, Vice President J.D. Vance also strongly criticised Zelenskyy during the meeting.With Russia ramping up its attacks on Ukraine, President Trump has warned of hefty sanctions and is pushing for peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv. This situation is only making international relations more tense and adding to the political chaos in the region.At the same time, the U.S. government has been dealing with market ups and downs due to tariff issues impacting trade with Canada and Mexico. These economic strains have led to some wild swings in U.S. stock prices, while European markets have surprisingly been on the rise.Germany's bold move to increase defense spending, going against its usual debt limits, has really shaken up bond prices, suggesting that there's a lot of optimism about growth.When Obama attended the game, it showed how influential he still is today because audiences strongly appreciated his participation in public events. Obama brought excitement to the crowd not only through his attendance but through his demonstration of how sports unite people particularly during challenging political and economic circumstances.Also Read : \u201cNone of Our Kids Are Disposable\u201d \u2014 How Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union Are Setting a New Parental Standard",

The property also includes an outdoor pool and fitness center as well as a restaurant and rooftop bar.\n\nWith Los Angeles playing host city to the NBA All-Star Game next year and Super Bowl LXI in 2027, the property, which is located near both the Intuit Dome and SoFi Stadium, is a strategic addition to the Hilton brand as sports tourism continues to gain momentum.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWith renovations currently underway, The Lum Hotel Los Angeles Stadium District will be primed for upcoming tentpole events including the NBA All-Star Game, which will be held at the Intuit Dome in February 2026, and Super Bowl LXI at SoFi Stadium in February 2027. The hotel is remaining open during the renovations.\n\n\u201cWith its prime location near world-class venues and rebranding as a Tapestry by Hilton, The Lum is poised to become a top destination for travelers visiting the area for business, sports, or entertainment,\u201d said Paul Sacco, chief growth and development officer for PM Hotel Group, in a statement.\n\nIt\u2019s located at the entrance to the Intuit Dome, which is the home of the Los Angeles Clippers, and directly across from Hollywood Park, and is the only upscale hotel within walking distance of SoFi Stadium, YouTube Theater and Hollywood Park Casino, per the release.\n\nThe proximity to these experiential spaces falls in line with Hilton\u2019s 2025 Trends Report, which found that one in four travelers plans to seek unique experiences in this year, along with an increase in sports tourism.\n\nHospitality pros told Hotel Dive earlier this year that sports tourism nationwide will continue to \u201cflourish\u201d in 2025. Hilton, specifically, saw its worldwide sports sales revenue triple in volume from 2019 to 2024, according to Frank Passanante, senior vice president and global head of sales at Hilton.\n\nOther Tapestry Collection hotels to open of late include The Knoll Hotel Napa Valley in Napa, California, and The Lofton Hotel in Minneapolis.",

DRI, operating via its subsidiaries, oversees restaurants throughout the United States and Canada, excluding two joint venture restaurants, four managed locations operating under contractual agreements and 91 franchised restaurants.\n\nHowever, sales growth alone doesn\u2019t provide a complete picture of a company\u2019s financial health. Evaluating a company\u2019s cash position alongside its revenues is a more effective investment strategy. A strong cash balance and steady cash flow provide flexibility for strategic decisions, operational stability and future investments.\n\nStrong revenue growth is also essential for long-term profitability. Although earnings can be improved by cutting costs, consistent bottom-line expansion typically requires steady sales increases.\n\nWhen evaluating a company, revenue often receives more scrutiny than earnings. Investors focus on a business\u2019s ability to generate increasing sales over time, as this indicates its potential to expand its customer base. In contrast, stagnant or declining sales growth may signal underlying challenges. While a company can still generate short-term profits, sustained growth is necessary to attract new investors.\n\nAgainst such a backdrop, the conventional method of selecting stocks is the need of the hour. One such way is choosing stocks with steady sales growth. In this regard, Darden Restaurants , The Middleby Corp. , Intuit Inc. , Cullen/Frost Bankers and American Electric Power are worth betting on.\n\nMarkets started 2025 on a strong note, but volatility has since taken hold. Earlier this week, the introduction of new tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico triggered a sharp selloff, and all three major indexes tanked, erasing the S&P 500\u2019s post-Election Day gains.

            "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 7, 2025 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are \u2014 Darden Restaurants DRI, The Middleby Corp. MIDD, Intuit Inc. INTU, Cullen/Frost Bankers CFR and American Electric Power AEP.\n\nBet on These 5 Stocks with Robust Sales Growth for Exceptional Returns\n\nMarkets started 2025 on a strong note, but volatility has since taken hold. Earlier this week, the introduction of new tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico triggered a sharp selloff, and all three major indexes tanked, erasing the S&P 500\u2019s post-Election Day gains. Although markets rebounded yesterday, concerns over the economic impact of these tariffs\u2014along with potential retaliatory measures\u2014are likely to keep investor sentiment cautious.\n\nAgainst such a backdrop, the conventional method of selecting stocks is the need of the hour. One such way is choosing stocks with steady sales growth. In this regard, Darden Restaurants, The Middleby Corp., Intuit Inc., Cullen/Frost Bankers and American Electric Power are worth betting on.\n\nWhen evaluating a company, revenue often receives more scrutiny than earnings. Investors focus on a business\u2019s ability to generate increasing sales over time, as this indicates its potential to expand its customer base. In contrast, stagnant or declining sales growth may signal underlying challenges. While a company can still generate short-term profits, sustained growth is necessary to attract new investors.\n\nStrong revenue growth is also essential for long-term profitability. Although earnings can be improved by cutting costs, consistent bottom-line expansion typically requires steady sales increases.\n\nHowever, sales growth alone doesn\u2019t provide a complete picture of a company\u2019s financial health. Evaluating a company\u2019s cash position alongside its revenues is a more effective investment strategy. A strong cash balance and steady cash flow provide flexibility for strategic decisions, operational stability and future investments.\n\n5 Stocks with Strong Sales Growth\n\nOrlando, FL-based Darden is one of the largest casual dining restaurant operators worldwide. DRI, operating via its subsidiaries, oversees restaurants throughout the United States and Canada, excluding two joint venture restaurants, four managed locations operating under contractual agreements and 91 franchised restaurants.\n\nDarden\u2019s expected sales growth rate for fiscal 2025 is 6.3%. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present.\n\nMiddleby, based in Elgin, IL, provides cooking, warming, food preparation and packaging equipment to commercial, industrial processing and residential markets. MIDD has manufacturing and distribution operations in the United States, Canada, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.\n\nMiddleby\u2019s expected sales growth rate for 2025 is 3.4%. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nMountain View, CA-based Intuit is a business and financial software company that develops and sells financial, accounting and tax preparation software and related services globally. INTU has offices in the United States, Canada, India, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Australia and other locations.\n\nIntuit\u2019s sales are expected to rise 12.4% in 2025. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present.\n\nCullen/Frost, based in San Antonio, TX, is a financial holding company and a bank holding company. CFR provides a broad array of products and services throughout numerous Texas markets.\n\nCullen/Frost\u2019s expected sales growth for 2025 is 4.1%. The company, at present, sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nColumbus, OH-based American Electric Power is a public utility holding company that generates, transmits and distributes electricity, natural gas and other commodities. Approximately 37% of AEP\u2019s power is generated from coal and lignite, 22% from nuclear energy, 22% from natural gas and oil and the remaining 19% from renewable sources.\n\nAmerican Electric Power\u2019s sales are expected to increase 5% in 2025.

            "content": "Good morning. Intuit, a fintech company, is experiencing a boost to its bottom line with AI.\n\nFor more than a decade, the company has operated an AI-driven expert platform strategy, Sandeep Aujla, EVP and CFO at Intuit, told me. Intuit continually practices cleaning up data, powering its AI engines\u2014and \u201cstaying humble,\u201d Aujla said. He added that the firm doesn\u2019t have the attitude that \u201cour LLMs [large language models] are the best,\u201d he said. \u201cLLMs are going to be the fastest depreciating assets out there,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, Intuit (No. 297 in the Fortune 500), which offers products like TurboTax, Credit Karma, and QuickBooks, has made big gains in leveraging AI for customer-facing applications and for use within the company. Investments in AI are on track to deliver nearly $90 million in annualized efficiencies in its fiscal year 2025, Aujla said. \u201cThat was slightly ahead of what we had expected for this year,\u201d he said.\n\nExpert training, workforce operations, and data entry are all areas that got a boost with agentic AI. For instance, the Intuit Assist tool is using AI agents to deliver \u201cdone-for-you experiences,\u201d which has contributed to a 20% reduction in the contact rate for TurboTax product support year to date, he said.\n\nAujla offered an example. When you\u2019re filing your tax returns using the tool, and have sold stocks, bonds, or other securities during the year, you will need a 1099-B supplemental form. The AI agent will ask you to download the form and share it. \u201cAI will then go through the supplemental form and automatically connect what the right tax bases would be,\u201d Aujla explained. That\u2019s saving people multiple hours of work, he said. \u201cI remember when I was doing my taxes myself, and what I would dread was that,\u201d Aujla said. \"And it would literally take about three hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough over 200 partnerships, we're able to automate 90% of the data that comes into a tax filing,\u201d he added. That\u2019s up from 68% last year. And essentially TurboTax users can have a bespoke experience on the platform, he said.\n\nA goal for Turbo Tax is to reduce that customer support time because \u201cwe get paid by the return, and we pay our experts by the hour,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if I can automate 90% of their tasks, that's money to the bottom line.\u201d\n\nInternally, including in the finance organization, the company is using AI knowledge engineering and machine learning to automate tasks, like data entry, he said.\n\nIntuit reported on Feb. 25 earnings for its second fiscal quarter that ended Jan. 31. The company reached $3.96 billion in revenue for the quarter, an increase of 17% year over year, which surpassed analyst estimates. Credit Karma revenue was up 36% year over year. And its Global Business Solutions Group revenue was up 19%. Amid the ongoing U.S. tax season, AI-enhanced offerings are giving the company a boost.\n\nDoes Aujla have advice for increasing efficiency using AI? \u201cFocus on driving productivity for everyone you serve, and be willing to experiment again and again,\u201d he said.\n\nSheryl Estrada\n\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

            "content": "Intuit (INTU) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software have returned +1.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.1% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Intuit belongs, has lost 6.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Intuit is expected to post earnings of $11.01 per share, indicating a change of +11.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.32 points to a change of +14.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.7%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.02 indicates a change of +14% from what Intuit is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intuit is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Intuit, the consensus sales estimate of $7.56 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.2%. The $18.3 billion and $20.52 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.4% and +12.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIntuit reported revenues of $3.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17%. EPS of $3.32 for the same period compares with $2.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.67%. The EPS surprise was +28.68%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIntuit is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuit. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\n\nIt's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\n\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

His 50-point outing marked the most by any player at Intuit Dome and his highest-scoring performance as a Clipper.\n\nHe also became just the fourth player in franchise history to record four 40-point games in a single season, joining Bob McAdoo, World B.

Looking deeper at the numbers, we found several encouraging factors beyond the headline profit numbers.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Intuit\n\nNasdaqGS:INTU Earnings and Revenue History March 4th 2025\n\nA Closer Look At Intuit's Earnings\n\nMany investors haven't heard of the accrual ratio from cashflow, but it is actually a useful measure of how well a company's profit is backed up by free cash flow (FCF) during a given period. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\n\nThat means a negative accrual ratio is a good thing, because it shows that the company is bringing in more free cash flow than its profit would suggest. While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nOver the twelve months to January 2025, Intuit recorded an accrual ratio of -0.12. Therefore, its statutory earnings were quite a lot less than its free cashflow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of US$5.6b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of US$3.04b. Intuit shareholders are no doubt pleased that free cash flow improved over the last twelve months.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On Intuit's Profit Performance\n\nAs we discussed above, Intuit has perfectly satisfactory free cash flow relative to profit. Based on this observation, we consider it likely that Intuit's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! And the EPS is up 38% annually, over the last three years. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Intuit at this point in time. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for Intuit and you'll want to know about it.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Intuit's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business. While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with significant insider holdings to be useful.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

(INTU), with a market cap of $171.6 billion, is a leading financial technology company that provides software solutions for accounting, tax preparation, and personal finance management. Headquartered in Mountain View, California, Intuit is best known for its flagship products, including QuickBooks (accounting software for businesses), TurboTax (tax preparation software for individuals and small businesses), Credit Karma (consumer credit monitoring and financial recommendations), and Mailchimp (marketing automation platform).\n\nCompanies valued at $10 billion or more are generally classified as \u201clarge-cap\u201d stocks, and Intuit fits this criterion perfectly, exceeding the mark. Founded in 1983, Intuit has grown into a dominant player in the fintech space by leveraging AI-driven insights and cloud-based technology to streamline financial tasks for individuals, small businesses, and accountants. The company benefits from strong customer retention, a growing base of small businesses, and increasing adoption of its AI-driven financial management tools.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nDespite this, Intuit\u2019s stock has retreated 15.1% from its 52-week high of $714.78, recorded on Nov. 13. Over the past three months, INTU shares have slipped 5.5%, underperforming the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX), which declined 3.3% during the same period.\n\nZooming out, the stock has dipped 3.8% over the past six months, trailing SPX's 5.8% gain. On a 52-week basis, INTU has tumbled 9.8%, significantly lagging SPX\u2019s 13.9% return.\n\nSince late December, Intuit\u2019s stock has remained below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, reinforcing a bearish trajectory.\n\nIntuit's stock surged 1.5% after delivering strong second-quarter 2025 results on Jan. 25, surpassing analysts' billings forecasts as revenue grew 17% year over year to $4 billion. Growth was fueled by a 19% rise in its Global Business Solutions Group, driven by QuickBooks and Mailchimp, while Credit Karma revenue soared 36% on higher demand for credit cards and personal loans. Its non-GAAP operating income and EPS climbed 26%, exceeding expectations.\n\nIntuit reaffirmed its fiscal 2025 guidance, projecting revenue between $18.16 billion and $18.35 billion, reflecting 12-13% growth. Non-GAAP operating income is forecasted at $7.24 billion-$7.32 billion, up 13-14%. The company anticipates non-GAAP diluted EPS of $19.16-$19.36, marking a 13-14% increase.\n\nIts top rival, Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR), has outperformed INTU substantially, with shares of PLTR surging 234.6% over the past 52 weeks and 1734% over the past six months.\n\nDespite INTU\u2019s underperformance over the past year, analysts are highly upbeat, with a consensus rating of \"Strong Buy\" from 28 analysts. Its mean price target of $721.27 implies a potential upswing of 20% from the current market prices.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Intuit (INTU).\n\nIntuit currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.59, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.59 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 29 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 21 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 72.4% and 3.5% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for INTU\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Intuit here>>>\n\n\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Intuit, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs INTU a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Intuit, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.7% over the past month to $19.33.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Intuit. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Intuit may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nJust Released: Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2025\n\nHurry \u2013 you can still get in early on our 10 top tickers for 2025.

            "content": "When Tax Day comes around each year, for most of us, it\u2019s met with a grumble and a sigh.\n\nIt usually starts with merely making a list of questions to answer before you can even get started. What documents do you need? How do you determine whether the rules have changed from last year? And, of course, which digital DIY tax filing service should you use?\n\nWe\u2019ve been there. But tax filing services like TurboTax, H&R Block and TaxSlayer can help guide you through the process \u2014 sometimes for free. It\u2019s worth evaluating your options to see what might work for you.\n\nIn this article, we review TurboTax\u2019s online filing services and tax software and see how it compares to the competition.\n\nThe 5 Dumbest Things We Keep Spending Too Much Money On You\u2019ve done what you can to cut back your spending. You brew coffee at home, you don\u2019t walk into Target and you refuse to order avocado toast. (Can you sense my millennial sarcasm there?) But no matter how cognizant you are of your spending habits, you\u2019re still stuck with those inescapable monthly bills. You know which ones we\u2019re talking about: rent, utilities, cell phone bill, insurance, groceries\u2026 Ready to stop paying them? Follow these moves\u2026\n\nTurboTax: How Does It Work?\n\nPerhaps the best known of the digital filing options, TurboTax is the tax-focused baby of Intuit, the same company behind Quickbooks.\n\nTurboTax is a great option for those who want everything from a full-service expert doing their taxes \u2014 thanks to TurboTax Live Full Service\u2019s guaranteed results \u2014 to someone who wants to use the guided software to input information on their own.\n\nThe service offers a free option. So you\u2019ll pay nothing if you\u2019re filing a simple tax return, which means using only the IRS Form 1040. About 37% of taxpayers are eligible for this option, per TurboTax.\n\nIs this all sounding a little too technical or overwhelming? You may want to invest instead in the TurboTax CD/download, which allows you to install the software on your computer. The cost of the Deluxe (and more) CD includes the tax preparation fee for one state and five federal e-filings.\n\nAs you can see, TurboTax offers much to choose from. It has three main pricing tiers as of January 2025, if you choose the online service rather than the downloadable software, and four main pricing tiers for the desktop service. Here\u2019s a little more about how much they cost and what they offer.\n\nTurboTax: File Your Own Taxes\n\nThe idea of free tax filing software sounds too good to be true, and that\u2019s because sometimes it is. Still, more than 10 million customers used the free filing service last year, per the company, a decrease of one million from the year before, so it is possible.\n\nThe TurboTax Free Edition is great for those who only need to cover W-2 income, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC) and child tax credits. You can also include interest or dividends that don\u2019t require filing a Schedule B as well as the student loan interest deduction and the IRS standard deduction. TurboTax estimates about 37% of tax payers are eligible.\n\nAnything more than that, like itemized deductions on Schedule A, stock sales or rental property income, will likely make you not qualify for the free service.\n\nBefore you start, look at the various deductions you plan to take and income you have to report. That way, you won\u2019t be surprised into buying a more expensive version of TurboTax halfway through.\n\nCost: $0-$89\n\nTurboTax Live Assisted\n\nIf your taxes might require a little extra help, more than just the simple file, then you\u2019ll want to shell out for TurboTax Live Assisted. Instead of doing your taxes on your own, you\u2019ll have access to a live tax expert with an average of 12 years of experience, per TurboTax. At the end, included in the cost of your filing, you will have an expert final review guaranteed at 100% accuracy. You\u2019ll also have access to the AI-powered Intuit Assist for any of your last-minute questions.\n\nThe key difference between Live Assisted and Live Full Service, the final tier, is you will not have consistent access to an assigned tax expert throughout the entire process. Instead, there will be a wide array of tax experts who can answer your questions but won\u2019t review your same case from start to finish. In Live Assisted, you won\u2019t be able to choose the tax expert you work with, but you will have access to an expert through phone, chat or live on-screen through one-way video chat.\n\nPrices range from $39-$159 based on the complexity of your tax return. There is also the option to add on other services, like an Audit Defense, which ensures you will have representation in the event that your return is audited.\n\nCost: Ranges from $39-$159\n\nFull Service\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who wants the white-glove treatment and to be sure everything is correct, then perhaps TurboTax\u2019s Full Service is the right option for you.\n\nFull Service experts are a different category of TurboTax employees. They will file your taxes for you virtually rather than Verified Pros, who are defined as \u201cindependent tax professionals who are vetted by TurboTax.\u201d Full Service experts work for you, so they will tell you their availability. But if you need access to an expert and your designated expert is not available, you\u2019ll still be able to reach other experts seven days a week from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. PT until the April 15 filing deadline, per TurboTax.\n\nYou\u2019ll be matched with your expert based on your tax situation and location \u2014 you may even be able to choose your specific professional. TurboTax won\u2019t give you a specific timeframe for completion, but they do ensure that their goal is to \u201cget your taxes done with as little waiting as possible.\u201d One of the benefits of Full Service is that you can work with the same tax expert year after year. Your expert is also on hand to answer your questions even after tax season is over.\n\nAlthough TurboTax\u2019s Lifetime Guarantee does promise audit support for the full seven-year life of your tax return, you will have to pay extra if you want an assigned Audit Representative to your case.\n\nCost: Starting at $89\n\nTurboTax Desktop\n\nBasic\n\nIf you want downloadable software on your computer from TurboTax for the cheapest price but you still want step-by-step guidance, Basic is the product for you. Unlike the other levels, it does not include a state e-file download. But it does allow you to transfer information from last year, claim tax credits and import your W-2 information. You\u2019ll also have access to TurboTax technical support.\n\nCost: $40 for five federal e-files; state download sold separately\n\nDeluxe\n\nThe Deluxe edition is the right choice for the person who doesn\u2019t want to shell out that much more but wants help finding all the possible tax credits for them.\n\nThis version helps you search more than 350 tax deductions and credits to find the ones that are a fit for you. That includes homeowner tax breaks, charitable donations plus mortgage and property tax deductions. If you have education tax credits or tax credits for dependents, you might want to go ahead and invest in Deluxe. This is also helpful when it comes to 1099-MISC income \u2014 i.e. earnings of an independent contractor like a freelance writer or Uber driver.\n\nBut if freelance work is your sole source of income, you\u2019ll be better off using the TurboTax Home & Business, which is recommended for personal and self-employed taxes and is described below.\n\nCost: $70 for five federal e-files and one state download\n\nCan You Survive 10 Days of Budgeting? If you need to wrangle your budget, it may be time to consider a savings challenge. Our 10-Day Savings Challenge will teach you how to make your money work for you with a high-yield savings account, stop overpaying on Amazon, earn money for trying out apps or watching movie previews and more. Start saving now!\n\nPremier\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who has additional income from investments and rental property, then you may want to upgrade to the Premier version of TurboTax. You\u2019ll get everything in Deluxe, as well as the ability to automatically import investment information from financial institutions, including stock and crypto activity, as well as look at your retirement accounts and determine how to maximize your retirement amount.\n\nIf you own property, TurboTax will simplify rental property depreciation and offer advice on how to set up new rental properties in the future. Once you\u2019re done, the system will also guide you on how to save more tax-wise for your next filing for the following tax year.\n\nCost: $105 for five federal e-files and one state download\n\nHome & Business\n\nIf the bulk of your income comes from a self-employed post, then you may want to consider TurboTax Home & Business. It works for industry-specific deductions and offers guidance for freelancers, independent contractors and small business owners, including on vehicle deductions and phone, supplies and utilities deductions.\n\nTurboTax guarantees your maximum tax refund.\n\nCost: $120 for five federal e-files and one state download\n\nFeatures\n\nNo matter which tier works best for you \u2014 and there\u2019s an easy, clickable questionnaire that helps you figure out the right product based on your tax situation \u2014 all TurboTax customers get access to a wide range of tools, guarantees and features.\n\nAudit Support Guarantee\n\nSay you\u2019ve done your taxes through TurboTax, whether individually or with a professional, and you end up receiving an audit letter from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Here\u2019s where the system\u2019s Audit Support Guarantee comes in.\n\nTurboTax offers one-on-one question-and-answer support with a tax professional through its Audit Support Center, if requested. This applies for returns filed up until tax year 2019. TurboTax has now updated its service to offer a paid option of Audit Defense, which offers you more protection for a price ranging from $40 to $60, if you have the Desktop product. This offers you full audit representation by a licensed tax professional, including in front of the IRS.\n\nMoney-Back Maximum Refund Guarantee\n\nTurboTax promises you the maximum tax refund. That means that if you find a bigger refund or smaller overall tax payment from another method, it will refund you the federal or state purchase price you paid for access to its programs. (Free users can get up to $30.) This is true for the lifetime of the tax return, defined as seven years from the date in which it was filed through TurboTax.\n\nMobile Apps for Apple and Android\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who likes to do things on the go, you can even file your taxes through an app. TurboTax has options for both Apple and Android users.\n\nRefund Advance\n\nOne of TurboTax\u2019s most unusual features may be the refund advance option of up to $4,000 with no loan fees, no credit impact and 0% APR. A few eligibility barriers apply: you\u2019ll have to have a refund of at least $500 and can\u2019t live in North Carolina, Connecticut or Illinois, for example.\n\nBut if you can apply, you could get the funds in as fast as a minute after the IRS accepts your tax return. You\u2019ll have to get them by opening a checking account with Credit Karma Money, also owned by Intuit, and can, once accepted, almost immediately use your Credit Karma Money virtual debit card loaded up with the funds from your return. A physical card should arrive within seven to 14 days. It\u2019s important to note you won\u2019t get your full refund \u2014 TurboTax refunds in amounts starting at $250 in increments of $250 and then eventually by $500 from $1,000 onward.\n\nOnce the IRS distributes the rest of your return, you\u2019ll receive the rest of the money into the Credit Karma Money checking account you\u2019ve already opened. (They will withhold the cost of any TurboTax service fees.)\n\nPay-With-My-Refund Options\n\nIf you anticipate having a high refund and want to pay for TurboTax with your refund instead of your bank account, that can be done. This service often comes with a $40 processing fee. To do this, you\u2019ll have to e-file your federal return and direct deposit your refund into a single account. It can only be used once.\n\nFees\n\nHere\u2019s how TurboTax fees look at a glance:\n\nOnline filing, from DIY to TurboTax Full Service: Free to at least $159, depending on tier\n\nDesktop software, from Basic to Home & Business: $40 to $120\n\nIf you owe taxes after you file, you can pay with credit card or debit card through payment processors recommended by TurboTax. This generally comes with a fee between $2 and $4 per transaction for a debit card and a percentage-based fee for a credit card.\n\nYou can also use an electronic funds withdrawal to pay directly from your bank account \u2014 that is, if you\u2019re e-filing your taxes and using tax preparation software, a tax professional or IRS Free File. You may have to pay a small fee to your banking institution.\n\nIs Your Paycheck Not Going As Far As It Used To? We get it. Everything is more expensive than it used to be, but your paycheck hasn\u2019t kept up. When money is tight, these resources will help nearly everyone.\n\nTurboTax: Pros and Cons\n\nNow that we\u2019ve laid out the basics of TurboTax\u2019s features, what\u2019s the verdict on its performance? Like all financial products and services, there are both pros and cons to using TurboTax.\n\n\n\nPros Affordable: TurboTax\u2019s tiers clock in at a lower price than similar tiers from competitors \u2014 though its free DIY service doesn\u2019t cover as many filers as other options.\n\nTurboTax\u2019s tiers clock in at a lower price than similar tiers from competitors \u2014 though its free DIY service doesn\u2019t cover as many filers as other options.

(INTU) The Best Stock To Buy For Financial Stability?\n\nA professional tax preparer, using a laptop to complete an income tax return.\n\nIntuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 89\n\nLone Pine Capital\u2019s Equity Stake: $727.02 Million\n\nA global leader in financial software solutions, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is headquartered in Mountain View, California, and led by CEO Sasan Goodarzi. The company\u2019s stock surged 5% following its fiscal Q2 2025 earnings report, which exceeded Wall Street expectations across all key metrics. The company, known for products like TurboTax, QuickBooks, and Credit Karma, posted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.32, surpassing analyst estimates of $2.58. Its revenue reached $3.96 billion, beating projections of $3.83 billion and reflecting a 17% year-over-year increase. Management highlighted the company\u2019s growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance customer experience and efficiency, with CFO Sandeep Aujla expressing confidence in delivering double-digit revenue growth and improved margins for the year. Additionally, the company's board approved a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share, a 16% increase from the previous year, payable on April 18, 2025.\n\nFor fiscal year 2025, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) reaffirmed its optimistic outlook, expecting revenue between $18.16 billion and $18.35 billion, reflecting 12-13% growth. The company\u2019s operating income is projected to grow 28-30%, while its diluted EPS is forecasted at $19.16 to $19.36, a 13-14% increase. It also provided guidance for Q3 2025, expecting revenue between $7.55 billion and $7.60 billion, with EPS ranging from $10.89 to $10.95.

            "content": "Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) recently announced its Q2 fiscal 2025 results (fiscal year ends in July), exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations for both revenue and earnings. It reported revenue of $3.96 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $3.32, compared to consensus estimates of $3.83 billion and $2.58, respectively. Increased demand for Intuit\u2019s AI-powered tools contributed to the strong performance. The positive results led to a surge in INTU stock following the announcement.\n\nHowever, despite this recent positive momentum, INTU stock, with a 10% decline since the start of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500, which is up 28%. This underperformance is attributable to the company\u2019s downbeat guidance provided in the previous quarter. If you want an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.\n\nIntuit\u2019s revenue of $4.0 billion in Q2 reflected a 17% year-over-year increase. Performance across segments varied: Global Business Solutions Group saw strong growth of 21% to $2.9 billion, Credit Karma sales rose 36% to $511 million, Consumer Group sales increased 3% to $509 million, while ProTax Group revenue was down 1% to $272 million.\n\nThe company benefited from improved pricing and customer growth. Intuit\u2019s adjusted operating margin expanded by 370 basis points year-over-year to 31.8% in Q2. This, combined with the higher revenue, resulted in earnings per share of $3.32, compared to $2.50 in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, Intuit reaffirmed its full-year outlook, projecting revenue between $18.16 billion and $18.35 billion, and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $19.16 to $19.36.\n\nFollowing the earnings announcement, INTU stock is trading up 8% in the pre-market. However, it\u2019s important to note that INTU stock has exhibited significant volatility over the recent years, with annual returns considerably less consistent than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 70% in 2021, -39% in 2022, 62% in 2023, and 1% in 2024.\n\nIn contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nGiven the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and ongoing trade wars, could INTU face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2014 or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think INTU stock has ample room for growth.\n\nTrading at approximately $600 pre-market, INTU stock currently has a price-to-sales ratio of 10.3x, slightly below its five-year average of 10.7x. Considering the company\u2019s upbeat Q2 results, strong sales growth, and expanding margins, we believe a higher valuation multiple than the historical average is justified. Therefore, despite the recent price increase, we see further room for growth in INTU stock.\n\nWhile INTU stock looks like it has some room for growth, it is helpful to see how Intuit\u2019s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

            "content": "Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi has reiterated their bullish stance on INTU stock, giving a Buy rating on February 27.\n\nSiti Panigrahi has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that suggest a significant upside potential for Intuit\u2019s stock. The sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) analysis conducted indicates a 25% potential increase in the share price, with an enterprise value of $221 billion and an implied share price of $767. Despite recent appreciation in the stock, it remains undervalued compared to its peak and trades near two-year lows, particularly reflecting only the value of its GBSG segment while underestimating the consumer business\u2019s profitability.\n\nSiti Panigrahi also notes the strong performance in the second fiscal quarter and the early momentum in TurboTax units and average revenue per return growth, which could lead to an upward revision of Intuit\u2019s fiscal year 2025 guidance. Additionally, the increase in TurboTax promotional prices aligns with regular tax season trends, further supporting the positive outlook. Consequently, the price target has been raised to $765, reinforcing the Buy rating.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, Panigrahi is a 2-star analyst with an average return of -0.3% and a 46.59% success rate. Panigrahi covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as Intuit, Paycom, and Workday.\n\nIn another report released on February 27, Barclays also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $775.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

Both offer a free version for federal and state filing. H&R Block\u2019s free tier supports more tax situations than TurboTax Free Edition*, but both allow you to report W-2 and limited 1099-INT/1099-DIV/1099-OID income (no Schedule B). You can\u2019t itemize, but these versions support the Child Tax Credit (CTC), Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), student loan interest deduction, and taxable qualified retirement plan distributions.\n\nWe reviewed the top-end versions for both, which you must use if you\u2019re self-employed and need to file a Schedule C. The companies still list their early filing prices as of this writing, but these will increase later in the tax season to the prices in parentheses. TurboTax Premium goes for $89 ($129) for federal returns and $39 ($64) per state. H&R Block Self-Employed costs a bit less at $85 ($125) for federal returns and $37 per state.\n\nNo matter which version you use, you don\u2019t pay until you file your return, which means you can always try out tax prep software before you enter any payment details. It doesn\u2019t matter when you start your return, though. TurboTax and H&R Block charge the current price at the time you actually pay (except in cases of a limited price lock). If you have to file in more than one state, remember that you have to pay a fee for each one.\n\nWinner: H&R Block\n\nUser Experience\n\nBecause a site\u2019s user experience can make or break your tax filing journey, we weigh this factor heavily in our reviews. We evaluate the quality of a tax website based on more than just the attractiveness of its fonts, graphics, and layout, though those aspects certainly contribute. The user experience for tax websites also comprises aspects such as navigation, overall functionality, and usability.\n\nTurboTax is conversant, using casual and understandable language. When we were working our way through the 1040, we were rarely at a loss about what came next, thanks to the software's conspicuous navigation cues on every page. TurboTax flows more easily and transparently from one topic to the next than H&R Block and can sometimes even help you forget that you\u2019re doing your income taxes (with all the pain that usually implies).\n\nH&R Block\u2019s tone is more matter-of-fact. It\u2019s friendly without bordering on cloying (TurboTax is sometimes guilty of this). Otherwise, it's visually attractive and provides good navigation cues for the most part. Still, TurboTax's design is more aesthetically pleasing, livelier, and fresher.\n\nWinner: TurboTax\n\nInterview and Walk-Throughs\n\nTurboTax and H&R Block use wizards and topic lists (or landing pages) to walk you through Form 1040 and its assorted forms and schedules, asking questions and moving your answers to official IRS forms in the background. You simply click navigation icons to advance or go back. Neither, unfortunately, has a comprehensive navigation menu like FreeTaxUSA, but you can do some navigation from the toolbars and section landing pages.\n\nTurboTax doesn't make you click around and scroll as much as H&R Block. For example, it advances you automatically when you answer a question on some pages, which saves time and clicks. TurboTax's landing pages are better as well; they list every possible topic area regardless of whether you indicated earlier that they apply to you. H&R Block shows the topic areas you selected, but it's more likely that you\u2019ll miss something because you have to click a link to see additional ones. TurboTax also offers more in terms of topic explanations. Both sites have some unbalanced pages (just one question or an abundance of them).\n\nWinner: TurboTax\n\nTax Coverage\n\nBoth applications cover tax topics in at least as much depth as any service we've tested, doing what they can to ensure that you understand exactly what applies to you and what you need to provide. That said, TurboTax digs deeper in places, especially advanced topic areas.\n\nWhen you're entering office expenses on Schedule C, for example, H&R Block just gives you one blank field for a total. TurboTax lets you add multiple lines so you can list the specific expenses that make up that total. It also breaks down medical expenses and charitable donations in more detail.\n\nTurboTax is also better overall at reporting investment sales related to stocks and cryptocurrency. Both sites allow you to import transactions from your broker(s) and exchange(s), but TurboTax supports more options. In terms of imports, TurboTax allows you to upload CSV files, while H&R Block supports PDFs. H&R Block joins TurboTax in allowing direct imports from CoinTracker and Coinbase. Each displays comprehensive fill-in-the-blank pages for each sale if you plan to enter them manually, though we don't recommend doing so if you have more than around 10 transactions.\n\nWinner: TurboTax\n\nHelp Resources\n\nBoth applications are exceptionally skilled at offering all kinds of help. TurboTax is a little better at providing extra assistance within the Q&A pages, so you don\u2019t have to access the site\u2019s help tools. It embeds tons of hyperlinks within those pages that open context-sensitive help files in a side pane. H&R Block does this, too, but not as frequently. TurboTax\u2019s writing is more conversational and easier to understand than H&R Block\u2019s, and it does a better job of error-trapping. For example, it caught two Form 1099-NECs from different companies that used the same Employer Identification Number.\n\nBoth TurboTax and H&R Block have massive, searchable databases of tax information. They offer two ways to find resources. First, you can manually search via a word, phrase, or form number and get a list of brief articles that answer your question and provide links to related pages. Neither site seems to prioritize these so that the most general articles appear first, and they sometimes display numerous answers that aren\u2019t very helpful. TaxAct does a better job here. Then again, your experience will depend on the search; some results are more targeted than others.\n\nAlternatively, both offer interactive help tools. These are automated AI chatbots that respond to you as if they were a real person. You can enter a question or phrase, and the bots respond directly to your query. These seemed gimmicky to me when I first tried them a few years ago, but they\u2019ve improved a lot over the years and now provide clear, focused responses. I consulted the bots first this year sometimes, rather than trying the traditional search tool. Here again, the more specific the question, the better the answer.\n\nBoth apps offer product help: TurboTax by phone and H&R Block by chat. Agents on the other end can\u2019t offer assistance with questions about tax law, though.\n\nH&R Block does offer professional help for tax questions via chat for free with all of its paid products. To get unlimited tax guidance from a pro with TurboTax (phone, chat, or video chat), you must pay $169 ($219 later in the tax season) for federal returns and $49 per state ($69 later in the tax season). With this Assisted offering, your expert does a final review of your return and is available for tax help year-round.\n\nIf you prepare your taxes online using H&R Block, you can have a tax professional review your return, ask any questions, and sign and e-file your return. Pricing for that service depends on the complexity of your return.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nMobile Apps\n\nTurboTax and H&R Block offer exceptional and comprehensive mobile tax apps for Android and iOS. They replicate the desktop versions\u2019 experience as much as possible, just for a smaller display.\n\nAccording to Intuit, 38.7% of TurboTax customers \u201ctouched\u201d mobile (app and web) at some point in the tax prep process for the 2023 tax year. Further, TurboTax customers snapped pictures of 5.4 million tax forms (4.7 million W-2s, 1.4 million 109X forms) with mobile devices.\n\nBoth TurboTax and H&R Block make it possible to prepare even a complex return on mobile. I didn\u2019t notice any critical tools, data, or navigation cues missing in my time with the apps.\n\nThe TurboTax apps cover the same tax topics as the browser-based version and incorporate the same sleek look and personality. Intuit offers two other mobile apps: TaxCaster and ItsDeductible (Apple only). You can enter a few details about your life to get an estimate of your tax refund via TaxCaster, while ItsDeductible lets you record your charitable donations throughout the year. At tax time, you can sync that data with TurboTax.\n\nThe H&R Block Tax Prep apps do a beautiful job of replicating the desktop experience, too. They\u2019re simple to navigate, include a capable help system, and provide comprehensive coverage of tax topics. H&R Block also has a companion app called MyBlock that helps you organize and access your tax-related documents throughout the year.\n\nWinner: Tie",

            "content": "Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) defied analyst predictions to release its quarterly results, which were ahead of market expectations. It was overall a positive result, with revenues beating expectations by 3.5% to hit US$4.0b. Intuit also reported a statutory profit of US$1.67, which was an impressive 98% above what the analysts had forecast. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\n\nView our latest analysis for Intuit\n\nNasdaqGS:INTU Earnings and Revenue Growth March 1st 2025\n\nFollowing the latest results, Intuit's 30 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$18.3b in 2025. This would be a credible 6.9% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to step up 17% to US$12.68. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$18.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$12.47 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.\n\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$710. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Intuit at US$860 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$530. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Intuit shareholders.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that Intuit's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 14% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 18% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this to the 425 other companies in this industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenue at 12% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while Intuit's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's expected to grow roughly in line with the industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$710, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.",

            "content": "Table of Contents Price User Experience Interview and Walk-Throughs Tax Coverage Help Resources Mobile Apps\n\nPrice\n\nTurboTax and H&R Block used to be further apart in price, but that's no longer the case. Both offer a free version for federal and state filing. H&R Block\u2019s free tier supports more tax situations than TurboTax Free Edition*, but both allow you to report W-2 and limited 1099-INT/1099-DIV/1099-OID income (no Schedule B). You can\u2019t itemize, but these versions support the Child Tax Credit (CTC), Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), student loan interest deduction, and taxable qualified retirement plan distributions.\n\nWe reviewed the top-end versions for both, which you must use if you\u2019re self-employed and need to file a Schedule C. The companies still list their early filing prices as of this writing, but these will increase later in the tax season to the prices in parentheses. TurboTax Premium goes for $89 ($129) for federal returns and $39 ($64) per state. H&R Block Self-Employed costs a bit less at $85 ($125) for federal returns and $37 per state.\n\nNo matter which version you use, you don\u2019t pay until you file your return, which means you can always try out tax prep software before you enter any payment details. It doesn\u2019t matter when you start your return, though. TurboTax and H&R Block charge the current price at the time you actually pay (except in cases of a limited price lock). If you have to file in more than one state, remember that you have to pay a fee for each one.\n\nWinner: H&R Block\n\nUser Experience\n\nBecause a site\u2019s user experience can make or break your tax filing journey, we weigh this factor heavily in our reviews. We evaluate the quality of a tax website based on more than just the attractiveness of its fonts, graphics, and layout, though those aspects certainly contribute. The user experience for tax websites also comprises aspects such as navigation, overall functionality, and usability.\n\nTurboTax is conversant, using casual and understandable language. When we were working our way through the 1040, we were rarely at a loss about what came next, thanks to the software's conspicuous navigation cues on every page. TurboTax flows more easily and transparently from one topic to the next than H&R Block and can sometimes even help you forget that you\u2019re doing your income taxes (with all the pain that usually implies).\n\nH&R Block\u2019s tone is more matter-of-fact. It\u2019s friendly without bordering on cloying (TurboTax is sometimes guilty of this). Otherwise, it's visually attractive and provides good navigation cues for the most part. Still, TurboTax's design is more aesthetically pleasing, livelier, and fresher.\n\nWinner: TurboTax\n\nInterview and Walk-Throughs\n\nTurboTax and H&R Block use wizards and topic lists (or landing pages) to walk you through Form 1040 and its assorted forms and schedules, asking questions and moving your answers to official IRS forms in the background. You simply click navigation icons to advance or go back. Neither, unfortunately, has a comprehensive navigation menu like FreeTaxUSA, but you can do some navigation from the toolbars and section landing pages.\n\nTurboTax doesn't make you click around and scroll as much as H&R Block. For example, it advances you automatically when you answer a question on some pages, which saves time and clicks. TurboTax's landing pages are better as well; they list every possible topic area regardless of whether you indicated earlier that they apply to you. H&R Block shows the topic areas you selected, but it's more likely that you\u2019ll miss something because you have to click a link to see additional ones. TurboTax also offers more in terms of topic explanations. Both sites have some unbalanced pages (just one question or an abundance of them).\n\nWinner: TurboTax\n\nTax Coverage\n\nBoth applications cover tax topics in at least as much depth as any service we've tested, doing what they can to ensure that you understand exactly what applies to you and what you need to provide. That said, TurboTax digs deeper in places, especially advanced topic areas.\n\nWhen you're entering office expenses on Schedule C, for example, H&R Block just gives you one blank field for a total. TurboTax lets you add multiple lines so you can list the specific expenses that make up that total. It also breaks down medical expenses and charitable donations in more detail.\n\nTurboTax is also better overall at reporting investment sales related to stocks and cryptocurrency. Both sites allow you to import transactions from your broker(s) and exchange(s), but TurboTax supports more options. In terms of imports, TurboTax allows you to upload CSV files, while H&R Block supports PDFs. H&R Block joins TurboTax in allowing direct imports from CoinTracker and Coinbase. Each displays comprehensive fill-in-the-blank pages for each sale if you plan to enter them manually, though we don't recommend doing so if you have more than around 10 transactions.\n\nWinner: TurboTax\n\nHelp Resources\n\nBoth applications are exceptionally skilled at offering all kinds of help. TurboTax is a little better at providing extra assistance within the Q&A pages, so you don\u2019t have to access the site\u2019s help tools. It embeds tons of hyperlinks within those pages that open context-sensitive help files in a side pane. H&R Block does this, too, but not as frequently. TurboTax\u2019s writing is more conversational and easier to understand than H&R Block\u2019s, and it does a better job of error-trapping. For example, it caught two Form 1099-NECs from different companies that used the same Employer Identification Number.\n\nBoth TurboTax and H&R Block have massive, searchable databases of tax information. They offer two ways to find resources. First, you can manually search via a word, phrase, or form number and get a list of brief articles that answer your question and provide links to related pages. Neither site seems to prioritize these so that the most general articles appear first, and they sometimes display numerous answers that aren\u2019t very helpful. TaxAct does a better job here. Then again, your experience will depend on the search; some results are more targeted than others.\n\nAlternatively, both offer interactive help tools. These are automated AI chatbots that respond to you as if they were a real person. You can enter a question or phrase, and the bots respond directly to your query. These seemed gimmicky to me when I first tried them a few years ago, but they\u2019ve improved a lot over the years and now provide clear, focused responses. I consulted the bots first this year sometimes, rather than trying the traditional search tool. Here again, the more specific the question, the better the answer.\n\nBoth apps offer product help: TurboTax by phone and H&R Block by chat. Agents on the other end can\u2019t offer assistance with questions about tax law, though.\n\nH&R Block does offer professional help for tax questions via chat for free with all of its paid products. To get unlimited tax guidance from a pro with TurboTax (phone, chat, or video chat), you must pay $169 ($219 later in the tax season) for federal returns and $49 per state ($69 later in the tax season). With this Assisted offering, your expert does a final review of your return and is available for tax help year-round.\n\nIf you prepare your taxes online using H&R Block, you can have a tax professional review your return, ask any questions, and sign and e-file your return. Pricing for that service depends on the complexity of your return.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nMobile Apps\n\nTurboTax and H&R Block offer exceptional and comprehensive mobile tax apps for Android and iOS. They replicate the desktop versions\u2019 experience as much as possible, just for a smaller display.\n\nAccording to Intuit, 38.7% of TurboTax customers \u201ctouched\u201d mobile (app and web) at some point in the tax prep process for the 2023 tax year. Further, TurboTax customers snapped pictures of 5.4 million tax forms (4.7 million W-2s, 1.4 million 109X forms) with mobile devices.\n\nBoth TurboTax and H&R Block make it possible to prepare even a complex return on mobile. I didn\u2019t notice any critical tools, data, or navigation cues missing in my time with the apps.\n\nThe TurboTax apps cover the same tax topics as the browser-based version and incorporate the same sleek look and personality. Intuit offers two other mobile apps: TaxCaster and ItsDeductible (Apple only). You can enter a few details about your life to get an estimate of your tax refund via TaxCaster, while ItsDeductible lets you record your charitable donations throughout the year. At tax time, you can sync that data with TurboTax.\n\nThe H&R Block Tax Prep apps do a beautiful job of replicating the desktop experience, too. They\u2019re simple to navigate, include a capable help system, and provide comprehensive coverage of tax topics. H&R Block also has a companion app called MyBlock that helps you organize and access your tax-related documents throughout the year.\n\nWinner: Tie",

You also might want to read customer reviews or talk to current customers before making your decision.\n\nBudgeting Apps Overview\n\nWhy Use a Budgeting App?\n\nA budgeting app can help you understand where you spend your money. It's also useful for building and maintaining an effective budget.\n\nThe top budgeting apps let you create a monthly budget using customizable categories.\n\nMany also help you save money effectively. For example, budgeting apps use your transaction history to make charts and graphs. You can use this information to analyze your spending patterns and figure out where to make adjustments in your budget.\n\nKey Benefits of Budgeting Apps\n\nThe primary benefit of using a budgeting app is that it gives you a big-picture view of your financial situation.\n\nMany budgeting apps let you link different types of bank accounts, investment accounts, credit cards, and loans. You'll be able to see all your accounts in one place and see how you're spending versus saving.\n\nBudgeting apps also help you build better money habits. If you've struggled to maintain a budget in the past, it might be easier to track your spending on an app than completely on your own. Budgeting apps do the work for you by syncing all your accounts \u2014 you just need to make sure everything is synced correctly and make small adjustments when they aren't.\n\nBudgeting App Features\n\nUser-Friendly Interface on Budgeting Apps\n\nA good budgeting app has a design format that's easy to use. The app should load quickly and make it easy to get started. You should be able to create a budget on your own without much help. If you encounter technical difficulties, you should also easily be able to contact a customer representative through the app.\n\nSyncing with Bank Accounts on Budgeting Apps\n\nMany easy-to-use budgeting apps for beginners allow you to sync savings accounts, checking accounts, investment accounts, or credit cards.\n\nApps often use Plaid to link bank accounts. Plaid can connect more than 11,000 U.S. banks and credit unions, including the best banks.\n\nMany banks also let you add investment and brokerage accounts the same way, although investment tracking tools might be limited compared to tools for budgeting with bank accounts.\n\nExpense Tracking on Budgeting Apps\n\nOnce bank accounts are linked, your spending will be updated on the app so you have up-to-date information. A strong budgeting app will provide updates frequently, and during the same day so you can stay on top of your budget.\n\nCustomizable Budgeting Categories on Budgeting Apps\n\nMany budgeting apps allow you to create a zero-balance budget. With a zero-balance budget, also called a zero-sum budget or a traditional budget, you're figuring out where every dollar of your income is going. You can create budget categories for every expense. You can also create savings goals if you're setting aside money for a specific purpose, like a down payment on a home or a future vacation.\n\nA good budgeting app allows you to make customizable budgeting categories rather than pre-set categories. That way, you can make a budget that's tailored to your life and make categories as broad or specific as you want.\n\nCharts and Visual Analysis Features on Budgeting Apps\n\nA top budgeting app analyzes your habits so you can see how you manage your money over time. Some apps provide charts of your monthly budget so you can see how your categories compare to one another. Others might have visuals to indicate how much money you have left to spend in a certain category for that month.\n\nSeveral budgeting apps also provide reports for broader areas of your finances. For example, you might be able to view your cash flow balance over several months or how your money in your retirement plans has grown over time.\n\nFee Structure on Budgeting Apps\n\nTypically, free budgeting apps can quickly be distinguished from ones that charge monthly or annual fees.\n\nFree budgeting apps that do not require a subscription, and may not even have a sign-up process when you first get it. These budgeting apps have limited budgeting features, though. For example, you might be able to make a monthly budget, but you might not have tools that analyze your cash flow or help you save for individual goals.\n\nSubscription budgeting apps will often require you to create an account, and many will have you input credit card information upon getting started. These apps also often offer a short free trial or free plan to help users test out features and decide if they're worth it. However, the app's more robust features require a subscription fee.\n\nHow to Choose the Best Budgeting App\n\nTo find the right budgeting app, you need to know what features you're looking for. Are you looking for ways to cut back on spending? Do you want a free plan or a subscription plan for your budgeting app? Do you want a detailed breakdown of your finances or more of a general overview? Do you want an app that helps you manage both your investment accounts and your bank accounts? Knowing the answers to these questions can help narrow down your options.\n\nIf you have your eye on a few budgeting apps, you can try out the free trials or free versions of each before settling on the right one. That way, you can see if the interface is also user-friendly and manageable for the long-term.\n\nAccount Linking vs. Manual Transaction Entry\n\nThe apps we chose as our best picks all offer bank account linking so that your direct deposits and transactions are automatically added to your budget. Some apps don't offer that feature, instead asking you to use manual transaction entry every time you add or subtract money from your account. Even with apps that let you link your bank account, you might find that your bank account isn't able to link to your budgeting app.\n\nManual transaction entry could be your best bet if you don't want to add your bank account info into your budgeting app or if you want to manually review each transaction you make for added financial awareness. But it's easy to accidentally leave things out of your budget with manual transaction entry, and it can be frustrating and time-consuming to enter all of that information into your app each month.\n\nBudgeting Apps with Educational Resources\n\nIf you want to learn more about finances, you might consider a budgeting app with financial tools. These tools can include things like articles and videos that teach you about financial literacy. For example, the budgeting app YNAB hosts free workshops that simultaneously teach you how to use the YNAB app and teach you some budgeting strategies.\n\nIf you're primarily interested in educational resources, some debit cards for teens come with apps that have financial literacy tools as well.\n\nBudgeting Strategies with Apps\n\nNot every app will be well-suited for every budgeting strategy.\n\nFor example, you could use the popular savings method of the 50/30/20 rule. This rule breaks down your budgeting so that 50% goes to needs, 30% goes to wants, and 20% goes to debt or savings. If you choose this method, you probably won't want to use an app designed for a zero-balance budget, like Monarch Money.\n\nSimilar to the 50/30/20 rule is the 70/20/10 rule, which allocates 70% of your income to both your wants and needs, 20% to your savings and investments, and 10% for donations and repaying debt. Both rules work better with a more lightweight budgeting app. Compare this to a traditional budget, where you account for every dollar that goes into and out of your account. This is a very granular approach that doesn't mesh well with more big-picture apps like Rocket Money.\n\nThere's also the pay-yourself-first strategy, which focuses on savings \u2014 you'll automatically transfer money from your paycheck to some of your savings and then distribute what's left over to your expenses. This is also a simpler approach that you probably don't need an intensive budgeting app for, but you might prefer to combine this budgeting strategy with other approaches.\n\nHow to Use a Budgeting App\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Your Budgeting App\n\nTo use a budgeting app, you'll have to download it through the Android or Apple store. To set up most budgeting apps, you'll enter your name and email address. If the app charges a subscription fee, it will prompt you to sign up for a plan or free trial.\n\nThe best budgeting apps will walk you through the app's different features and help you get started. You'll typically be prompted to link accounts. Then, you can create a budget or set savings goals.\n\nTips for Effective Budgeting with the Apps\n\nIf you're new to budgeting apps, it may be helpful to start off with some structure by choosing a budgeting strategy. Whatever strategy you choose, you'll want to make sure the budgeting app you get works with that strategy.\n\nAnother tip for effective budgeting is to look at your expenses to see if they reflect your financial goals and values. If you have certain goals that are of higher priority than others, find ways to reduce spending in categories that aren't a priority for you. That might mean waiting before making a purchase, creating a meal plan or grocery list to limit spending on food, or auditing your subscriptions to see if there are any you can cancel.\n\nIf you're someone who's new to budgeting, it could be worthwhile to read some of the best personal finance books, so you can learn about different people's approaches and tips to spending and saving.\n\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid on Budgeting Apps\n\nExperts recommend trying out a budgeting app's free plan or free trial before committing to an annual plan.\n\nThere are many budgeting apps out there, so you want to try to find the one that best aligns with your financial needs. Testing a few apps can help you decide the best one, and it also keeps you from paying too much for a budgeting app that you won't end up using.\n\nYou'll also want to make sure that the budgeting app you're interested works on the platforms you want to budget on. Not every budgeting app is available on desktop, so if you prefer to budget on the computer, check ahead of time that the app you're planning on using has a browser or desktop app equivalent.\n\nPros and Cons of Budgeting Apps\n\nPros of Budgeting Apps\n\nGives you a big picture of how you're spending and saving money\n\nAllows you to create a budget that's synced with bank accounts\n\nSome apps have additional perks to help with goal-setting or bill-negotiating\n\nCons of Budgeting Apps\n\nMost budgeting apps with comprehensive features charge a subscription fee\n\nBudgeting apps with sync may require trial and error to ensure information is recorded correctly\n\nBudgeting apps without syncing can take time and effort to set up and maintain, so whether it's worthwhile could depend on whether you like having budgeting information straight on your phone versus a spreadsheet or DIY method\n\nAlternatives to Budgeting Apps\n\nBudgeting Apps vs. Spreadsheet or DIY Budgeting Methods\n\nYou may prefer building a spreadsheet budget if you don't want to link all of your bank accounts or credit cards in a mobile app. However, setting up and maintaining your budget will primarily hinge on how much work you're willing to put into it.\n\nA budgeting app does the tracking for you. With a spreadsheet, you'll have to either start from scratch or use a template. Either way, a budgeting app still offers more comprehensive features.\n\nBudgeting Apps vs. Envelope Budgeting\n\nEnvelope budgeting is a strategy that relies on physical envelopes, though you can recreate it partially in budgeting apps. With envelope budgeting, also sometimes called envelope stuffing, you put a certain amount of cash into envelopes with different categories \u2014 such as rent, clothing, or food \u2014 each month. That's the money you get to spend on these categories each month; if you put $800 in the food category, for example, you're limited to that $800 for the entire month.\n\nBudgeting apps can let you set up a similar system, but you won't be physically cash-limited in the same way that physical envelopes limit you. That being said, it's increasingly hard to use cash to pay for everything, so you might find an app-based envelope budget easier to handle overall.\n\nBudgeting Apps vs. Personal Finance Software\n\nBudgeting apps and personal finance software share the same features. The best option for you will depend on whether you have preferences on the tool's accessibility.\n\nA budgeting app is primarily designed for mobile experiences. Some apps also have an online dashboard that you can access through your computer, but it is always something that's offered.\n\nMeanwhile, personal finance software is designed for computer access. You'll either download the software to a desktop or use an online platform. Some will also have apps, but some features might not be available.\n\nBudgeting Apps vs. Savings Accounts with Goals Features\n\nSome of the best online banks have added unique features to their savings accounts to help customers with goal-setting.\n\nIf you're specifically looking for a way to save for goals, it may benefit you to get a savings account with buckets. Buckets are customizable tools that separate your savings so you can save for specific goals. Since they are an integrated bank account feature, they also might be easier to manage than a budgeting app.\n\nIf you would rather have more robust budgeting tools, a budgeting app will likely still stand out to you. Budgeting apps also connect investment accounts, credit cards, and loans, so you'll be able to see everything in one place.\n\nAlso, if you are currently unbanked because you don't have a U.S. ID, know that you have options. The top banks for immigrants and non-U.S. citizens allow you to provide a foreign passport or Matricula Consular to open a bank account.\n\nWhy You Should Trust Us: Experts' Advice on the Best Budgeting Apps\n\nWe consulted banking and financial planning experts to inform these picks and provide their advice on finding the budgeting app for your needs.\n\nSophia Acevedo, banking editor, Business Insider\n\nMykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor, BoujieBudgets.com\n\nHere's what they had to say about budgeting apps.

For example, if you are a person who knows that you want to stick to a zero-based budget, and you've been doing that manually, but you need maybe a little bit more help with the organization, then you can center your focus on searching for apps specifically solve your problem.\"\n\nSophia Acevedo, banking editor, Business Insider:\n\n\"I would look for features that would help me with my goals. Like if I'm trying to curb spending, I would look for a budgeting app that helps me minimize payments in certain spending areas.\"\n\nHow do I know if a budgeting app is right for me?\n\nMykail James, MBA, CFEI:\n\n\"Give it time. Every budgeting app is going to feel uncomfortable during the first month. Give it at least three months before deciding if it's not something for you. Actively try and use it before considering a switch.\"\n\nSophia Acevedo, Business Insider:\n\n\"I would first try out the free version and see how it works. Some budgeting apps are entirely free, while others have different plans or trials at a variety of price points.\"\n\nMethodology: How Did We Choose the Best Budgeting Apps?\n\nBusiness Insider's personal finance team compiled a list of 18 popular budgeting apps available in both the Google Play Store and Apple Store.\n\nThen, we reviewed each budgeting app for a week.

            "content": "Intuit Inc. ((INTU)) has held its Q2 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.\n\nIntuit Inc. recently held its earnings call, which was marked by an overwhelmingly positive sentiment. The company showcased strong financial performance across various segments, highlighted significant advancements in AI-driven products, and celebrated successful expansion into mid-market segments. While there were minor challenges, such as a slight decline in the ProTax Group and growth hurdles for Mailchimp, these were largely overshadowed by the company\u2019s robust revenue growth and strategic achievements.\n\nStrong Revenue Growth\n\nIntuit reported an impressive 17% revenue growth for the second quarter of 2025, underscoring its strong business performance across all segments. This growth reflects the company\u2019s ability to effectively leverage its diverse product offerings and expand its market reach.\n\nRecord Operating Income\n\nThe company achieved record operating income, with GAAP operating income increasing by 61% to $593 million and non-GAAP operating income rising by 26% to $1.3 billion. These figures highlight Intuit\u2019s operational efficiency and effective cost management strategies.\n\nTurboTax Live Full Service Success\n\nTurboTax Live Full Service achieved a Product Recommendation Score of 84, indicating high customer satisfaction. The success of this service is attributed to AI-driven enhancements that have improved user experience and service delivery.\n\nCredit Karma Revenue Surge\n\nCredit Karma experienced a 36% revenue growth, driven by strong performance in credit cards, personal loans, and auto insurance. This surge underscores the platform\u2019s growing influence in the personal finance sector.\n\nExpansion in Mid-Market Segment\n\nIntuit\u2019s strategic focus on mid-market customers resulted in a 40% growth in Online Ecosystem revenue for QBO Advanced and Intuit Enterprise Suite. This expansion highlights the company\u2019s successful penetration into larger market segments.\n\nProTax Group Revenue Decline\n\nDespite the overall positive performance, ProTax Group revenue saw a slight decline of 1% in the second quarter. This area remains a challenge for Intuit, requiring strategic adjustments to reverse the trend.\n\nMailchimp Revenue Growth Challenges\n\nMailchimp faced revenue growth challenges due to the lapping of price changes, indicating ongoing difficulties in scaling its business. This highlights the need for strategic initiatives to drive sustainable growth in this segment.\n\nForward-Looking Guidance\n\nIntuit provided robust guidance for the future, reiterating its full-year expectations for double-digit revenue growth and expanding margins. The company projects total revenue growth between 12% and 13% for fiscal 2025, with GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expected to grow by 18% to 20% and 13% to 14%, respectively. Intuit\u2019s CEO emphasized the momentum in their AI-driven platform strategy and anticipated continued growth in consumer platforms like TurboTax and Credit Karma.\n\nIn conclusion, Intuit\u2019s recent earnings call painted a positive picture of the company\u2019s financial health and strategic direction. With strong revenue growth, record operating income, and successful expansion into new market segments, Intuit is well-positioned for continued success. Despite minor challenges, the company\u2019s forward-looking guidance remains optimistic, promising sustained growth and innovation.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

INTU and Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH.\n\nWatch These 3 Stocks for Solid Earnings Acceleration\n\nTop executives and analysts are drawn to consistent earnings growth as it signals a company's profitability, but earnings acceleration is even more effective at boosting the stock price.\n\nStudies have shown that most successful stocks have seen earnings acceleration before an uptick in the stock price. To that end, Prairie Operating Co., Intuit Inc. and Cardinal Health, Inc. are exhibiting strong earnings acceleration.\n\nWhat is Earnings Acceleration?\n\nEarnings acceleration is the incremental growth in a company\u2019s earnings per share (EPS). In other words, if a company\u2019s quarter-over-quarter earnings growth rate increases within a stipulated time frame, it can be called earnings acceleration.\n\nIn the case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. However, earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven\u2019t yet caught the attention of investors and, once secured, will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both the direction and magnitude of growth rates.\n\nAn increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period. Meanwhile, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may drag prices down.\n\nThe above criteria narrowed the universe of around 7,735 stocks to only 13. Here are the top three stocks:\n\nPrairie Operating\n\nPrairie Operating is an independent energy company. It currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). PROP\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 81.2%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nIntuit Inc.\n\nIntuit offers financial management, compliance and marketing products/services in the United States. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). INTU\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 13.8%.\n\nCardinal Health\n\nCardinal Health is a global healthcare services and products company. It currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). CAH\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 5.4%.\n\nYou can sign up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your trading.

To celebrate the refresh of popup forms, Mailchimp\u2019s in-house creative agency, Wink Creative, is turning up the volume with its latest brand campaign, \u201cPopup Like It\u2019s Hot.\u201d The team remixed an iconic hip-hop track to create a high-energy marketing anthem that highlights how marketers can seamlessly grow their audience with popup forms. With catchy, campaign-driven lyrics, the track lays down the beat for marketers looking to strengthen their customer base and drive revenue growth. The ad will be featured across various channels including podcasts, social media, and more. Says Jeremy Jones, Executive Creative, Wink Creative at Mailchimp: \u201cBringing this campaign to life over the iconic early 2000s hip-hop beat was an exciting challenge that pushed our creative boundaries. Our team, in collaboration with Breakfast for Dinner, leveraged a blend of still imagery and emerging AI technologies to produce something truly unique. This approach not only increased flexibility and efficiency in our creative process but also reimagined how we bring Mailchimp\u2019s popup forms to market\u2014delivering an innovative campaign that excites marketers about this powerful reinvention.\u201d\n\nWith popup forms, marketers can grow their customers using customisable, mobile-first designs for deeper audience targeting and seamless zero-party data collection. Popup forms empower marketers to collect data directly from customers and prospects, which enables AI-powered, truly personalised marketing. While e-commerce businesses will see significant value from popup forms, the solution is designed to support a wide range of industries. With eight different and new offer types, businesses can use popups to drive conversions with opt-ins customers are already looking for, like discount promotions, free shipping, free content, consultations, contests and giveaways, event signups, newsletter subscriptions, and more. The variety of popup offer types ensure marketers can collect richer audience insights than they were able to do before. \u201cMarketers are increasingly prioritising ownership of their customer relationships and data, with lead generation as a crucial step toward long-term success,\u201d says Fay Kallel, VP of Product and Design at Intuit Mailchimp. \u201cPopup forms solve a top pain point for marketers and SMBs, allowing them to collect data directly from customers, creating a frictionless way to capture leads, grow their customers, and build deeper, more meaningful relationships. Compelling data capture provides the foundation for how marketers can leverage AI for more effective personalisation, and we\u2019re making it easier than ever for them to integrate this effective tool into their strategies.\u201d Before marketers can effectively connect with customers through email and SMS campaigns, they first need a seamless way to capture opt-ins. Popup forms simplify this process by making it more intuitive for marketers and more personalised for customers, helping ensure higher engagement and conversion rates from the start with benefits like: \u2022 Unlimited design customisation to create beautiful, mobile-first popups..\n\n\u2022 Access to 80+ fully-designed templates to streamline setup and maximise results.\n\n\u2022 Full customisation of templates\u2014 including fonts, buttons, colors, imagery, logos, and layout\u2014 for a design that matches brand identity.\n\n\u2022 Dynamic visitor targeting with custom filters and triggers that can help convert traffic into subscribers.\n\n\u2022 Seamless zero-party data capture to build richer customer profiles for targeted email and SMS campaigns.\n\n\u2022 Opt-in lead generation that can help reduce acquisition costs and accelerate list growth.",

            "content": "Why Is Intuit (INTU) Stock Soaring Today\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of tax and accounting software provider, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) jumped 13.6% in the morning session after the company delivered strong fourth-quarter 2024 results, beating analysts' billings forecasts as revenue climbed 17% year on year. Growth came from a 19% jump in its Global Business Solutions Group, powered by QuickBooks and Mailchimp, while Credit Karma revenue soared 36%, driven by rising demand for credit cards and personal loans. Profits grew even faster. Operating income surged 61% under GAAP accounting, while non-GAAP operating income rose 26%, thanks to better margins. This strength lifted non-GAAP EPS by 26%, topping expectations.\n\nFor the full year, the company reaffirmed its outlook. Overall, the quarter was strong, with solid revenue and profit growth, though the unchanged full-year forecast signals stable rather than accelerating momentum.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $625.91, up 12.7% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Intuit? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nIntuit\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. Moves this big are rare for Intuit and indicate this news significantly impacted the market\u2019s perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago when the stock dropped 8.3% on the news that the company reported weak second-quarter 2024 earnings results. Its gross margin declined, and its billings missed Wall Street's estimates. The company also provided underwhelming long-term guidance ahead of its investor day session. FY25 growth projection for the Consumer segment was lowered to 6-10% (from prior 8-12%). Similarly, Credit Karma revenue forecast was revised to 10-15% (from the prior 20-25%), while the SBSE ( Small Business and Self Employed) unit was unchanged at 15-20%. Overall, it was a challenging quarter, given the weak outlook.\n\nIntuit is up 0.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $625.51 per share, it is still trading 11.4% below its 52-week high of $706.25 from November 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Intuit\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,233.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

The company posted non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $3.32, significantly surpassing the analysts' consensus of $2.57. Total revenue reached $3.96 billion, above the anticipated $3.83 billion. The quarter's performance was bolstered by substantial growth in its Credit Karma and global business solutions segments, showcasing the effectiveness of Intuit's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy. Overall, the quarter exceeded both analyst and management expectations, highlighting the company's strategic alignment and robust performance.\n\nMetric Fiscal 2025 Q2 Fiscal 2025 Q2 Analysts' Estimate Fiscal 2024 Q2 % Change EPS (non-GAAP) $3.32 $2.57 $2.63 26% Revenue $3.96 billion $3.83 billion $3.39 billion 17% Operating income (non-GAAP) $1.26 billion N/A $1.0 billion 26%\n\nOverview of Intuit's Business\n\nIntuit is a leader in financial software, primarily serving small businesses, self-employed individuals, and consumers with products like QuickBooks, TurboTax, and Mint. A critical driver of Intuit\u2019s recent success has been its AI-driven strategy, which enhances customer experiences by automating workflows and providing AI-powered advice. Intuit\u2019s small business segment, an engine of growth, benefits from tools that help businesses efficiently manage finances. Credit Karma, an important part of Intuit\u2019s consumer offerings, continues to grow by providing personal financial insights and products. The successful integration of AI into its products and expanding its market offerings are fundamental to Intuit\u2019s agenda.\n\nIntuit's focus on the small business and self-employed segment, which accounts for a significant share of revenue, remains pivotal. Intuit also targets growth in Credit Karma by leveraging personalized data insights, showcasing its commitment to consumer financial empowerment.\n\nQuarter Highlights and Developments\n\nDuring the fiscal quarter, which ended Jan. 31, Intuit managed notable financial achievements and made strategic progress. In particular, the global business solutions group's revenue rose by 19% to $2.7 billion. QuickBooks Online Accounting, a key driver, posted growth of 22%, fueled by customer additions and adjusted pricing. Online ecosystem revenue surged by 21%, aligning with management's goal of approximately 20% annual growth.\n\nThe Credit Karma segment was a standout performer, with revenues jumping by 36% to $511 million, setting a new benchmark for the segment. For the full year, that segment is only expected to delver annual growth in the 5% to 8% range. The consumer group, however, faced a challenging quarter with modest growth of 3% to $509 million, which underperformed management's fiscal year expectations due to strategic adjustments in promotions.\n\nWhile Intuit recorded strong overall growth, some areas required attention. The ProTax group saw a revenue decline of 1% to $272 million. Management is targeting 3% to 4% growth for the fiscal year, but acknowledges the need for improvement. On the innovation front, Intuit continues to capitalize on its AI initiatives to enhance product offerings and customer experiences.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nIntuit reaffirmed its full-year guidance, projecting revenue between $18.160 billion and $18.347 billion, or growth of about 12% to 13%. GAAP operating income is expected to increase by 28% to 30%. That guidance suggests continued confidence in AI and customer-centric advancements as growth drivers.\n\nFor the fiscal third quarter, Intuit projects revenues of $7.55 billion to $7.6 billion. GAAP diluted EPS is forecast to be between $9.22 and $9.28, with non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $10.89 to $10.95. Investors should monitor how Intuit\u2019s AI integration progresses, how it manages its expansion in key segments, and how it executes on its updated promotional strategies, as these factors will be crucial for maintaining growth and achieving its longer-term financial objectives.",

            "content": "Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) recently announced its Q2 fiscal 2025 results (fiscal year ends in July), exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations for both revenue and earnings. It reported revenue of $3.96 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $3.32, compared to consensus estimates of $3.83 billion and $2.58, respectively. Increased demand for Intuit\u2019s AI-powered tools contributed to the strong performance. The positive results led to a surge in INTU stock following the announcement.\n\nHowever, despite this recent positive momentum, INTU stock, with a 10% decline since the start of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500, which is up 28%. This underperformance is attributable to the company\u2019s downbeat guidance provided in the previous quarter. If you want an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.\n\nIntuit\u2019s revenue of $4.0 billion in Q2 reflected a 17% year-over-year increase. Performance across segments varied: Global Business Solutions Group saw strong growth of 21% to $2.9 billion, Credit Karma sales rose 36% to $511 million, Consumer Group sales increased 3% to $509 million, while ProTax Group revenue was down 1% to $272 million.\n\nThe company benefited from improved pricing and customer growth. Intuit\u2019s adjusted operating margin expanded by 370 basis points year-over-year to 31.8% in Q2. This, combined with the higher revenue, resulted in earnings per share of $3.32, compared to $2.50 in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, Intuit reaffirmed its full-year outlook, projecting revenue between $18.16 billion and $18.35 billion, and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $19.16 to $19.36.\n\nFollowing the earnings announcement, INTU stock is trading up 8% in the pre-market. However, it\u2019s important to note that INTU stock has exhibited significant volatility over the recent years, with annual returns considerably less consistent than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 70% in 2021, -39% in 2022, 62% in 2023, and 1% in 2024.\n\nIn contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nGiven the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and ongoing trade wars, could INTU face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2014 or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think INTU stock has ample room for growth.\n\nTrading at approximately $600 pre-market, INTU stock currently has a price-to-sales ratio of 10.3x, slightly below its five-year average of 10.7x. Considering the company\u2019s upbeat Q2 results, strong sales growth, and expanding margins, we believe a higher valuation multiple than the historical average is justified. Therefore, despite the recent price increase, we see further room for growth in INTU stock.\n\nWhile INTU stock looks like it has some room for growth, it is helpful to see how Intuit\u2019s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Excluding discrete tax items primarily related to share-based compensation, our effective tax rate for both periods was approximately 24%. The difference from the federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible share-based compensation, which were partially offset by the tax benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit. We recorded $1 million in tax expense on pretax income of $354 million for the three months ended January 31, 2024. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended January 31, 2024 was approximately 4%. Excluding discrete tax items primarily related to share-based compensation, our effective tax rate for both periods was approximately 24%. The difference from the federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible share-based compensation, which were partially offset by the tax benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit. In the current global tax policy environment, the U.S. and other domestic and foreign governments continue to consider, and in some cases enact, changes in corporate tax laws. As changes occur, we account for finalized legislation in the period of enactment.\n\nTABLE B1 INTUIT INC.

[d] Reflects estimated adjustments in item [c], income taxes related to these adjustments, other income tax effects related to the use of the non-GAAP tax rate, and adjustments for a net loss on other long-term investments.\n\nINTUIT INC.\n\nABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nThe accompanying press release dated February 25, 2025 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B1, Table B2, and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.\n\nWe compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we exclude from our non-GAAP measures gains and losses from the revaluation of our executive deferred compensation plan liabilities, and the related gains and losses on our executive deferred compensation plan assets. Prior periods have not been reclassified as amounts are immaterial.\n\nWe exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:\n\nAmortization of acquired technology\n\nAmortization of other acquired intangible assets\n\nRestructuring charges\n\nShare-based compensation expense\n\nGains and losses on executive deferred compensation plan liabilities\n\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairment charges\n\nGains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets\n\nProfessional fees and transaction costs for business combinations\n\nWe also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:\n\nGains and losses on debt securities and other investments\n\nGains and losses on executive deferred compensation plan assets\n\nIncome tax effects and adjustments\n\nDiscontinued operations\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit\u2019s operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments, or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, restructuring, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.\n\nThe following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nAmortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. When we acquire a business in a business combination, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the business and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired businesses. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists and trade names.\n\nRestructuring charges. This consists of costs incurred as a direct result of discrete strategic restructuring actions, including, but not limited to severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other costs, which are different in terms of size, strategic nature, and frequency than ongoing productivity and business improvements.\n\nShare-based compensation expense. This consists of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units, and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.\n\nGains and losses on executive deferred compensation plan liabilities. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses on the revaluation of our executive deferred compensation plan liabilities.\n\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.\n\nGains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets because they are unrelated to our ongoing business operating results.\n\nProfessional fees and transaction costs for business combinations. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal, and accounting fees.\n\nGains and losses on debt securities and other investments. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and gains and losses on other investments.\n\nGains and losses on executive deferred compensation plan assets. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses on the revaluation of our executive deferred compensation plan assets.\n\nIncome tax effects and adjustments. We use a long-term non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating operating results and for planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate excludes the income tax effects of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments described above, and eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency. Based on our long-term projections, we are using a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 24% for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for various reasons including significant acquisitions, changes in our geographic earnings mix, or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. We will evaluate this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis and whenever any significant events occur which may materially affect this rate.\n\nOperating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nThe reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments, and disposals of businesses and long-lived assets.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250225842551/en/\n\nInvestors\n\nKim Watkins\n\nIntuit Inc.\n\n650-944-3324\n\nkim_watkins@intuit.com\n\nMedia\n\nKali Fry\n\nIntuit Inc.\n\n650-944-3036\n\nkali_fry@intuit.com\n\nSource: Intuit Inc.",

The financial software firm also reaffirmed its full-year outlook. Intuit stock rose in extended trading.\n\nThe tax-prep and accounting software maker earned an adjusted $3.32 a share on sales of $3.96 billion in the quarter ended Jan. 31. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Intuit earnings of $2.57 a share on sales of $3.83 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Intuit earnings rose 26% while sales increased 17%.\n\nFor the current quarter ending April 30, Intuit forecast adjusted earnings of $10.92 a share on sales of $7.58 billion. That's based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street had been modeling earnings of $11.51 a share on sales of $7.52 billion. In the same quarter last year, Intuit earned an adjusted $9.88 a share on sales of $6.74 billion.\n\nThe lower-than-expected earnings guidance for fiscal Q3 was due to a shift in expenses, Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi said in a client note.\n\nIntuit reiterated its outlook for the full fiscal year. Based on the midpoint of its guidance, Intuit expects to earn an adjusted $19.26 a share on sales of $18.25 billion. That would translate to year-over-year growth of 14% in earnings and 12% in revenue. However, Wall Street had been looking for fiscal 2025 earnings of $19.29 a share on sales of $18.28 billion.\n\nMountain View, Calif.-based Intuit offers personal and business financial software including TurboTax, QuickBooks, Credit Karma and Mailchimp.\n\n\"We are making great progress fueling the financial success of consumers, businesses, and accountants with our AI-driven expert platform,\" Chief Executive Sasan Goodarzi said in a news release. \"Intuit Assist is delivering 'done-for-you' experiences to complete tasks, automate end-to-end workflows, and connect customers to AI-powered human experts, powering their prosperity.\"\n\nIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, Intuit stock rose nearly 5% to 582.81.

Online Ecosystem revenue increased to $2 billion, up 21%.\n\n\u201cWe are making great progress fueling the financial success of consumers, businesses and accountants with our AI-driven expert platform,\u201d said Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi. \u201cIntuit Assist is delivering \u2018done-for-you\u2019 experiences to complete tasks, automate end-to-end workflows and connect customers to AI-powered human experts, powering their prosperity.\u201d\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) was the theme of both Intuit\u2019s fiscal year and Tuesday\u2019s investor call as executives stressed the benefits of its AI solutions designed to support small- to medium-sized business (SMB) owners.\n\n\u201cWe continue to feel very optimistic about the full year, and I\u2019m looking forward to having to continue to deliver a very strong tax season,\u201d Intuit CFO Sandeep Aujla said. \u201cWe delivered very strong second quarter fiscal 2025 results as we leverage AI to deliver breakthrough experiences for our customers and increase productivity across our platform.\u201d\n\nIntuit shares were trading up mid-single digits after hours on the back of the most recent earnings.\n\nRead more: TurboTax Debuts Early Refund Tool For Tax Season\n\nAI-Powered Financial Assistance: A Game Changer?\n\nBy automating routine tasks and offering intelligent financial insights, AI solutions are simplifying business operations and supporting entrepreneurs focused on business growth and serving their customers.\n\nAccording to a PYMNTS Intelligence report, \u201cStrategic GenAI Integration Is Unlocking Higher ROI for CMOs,\u201d 37% of CMOs reported positive return on investment (ROI) from GenAI in October \u2014 up from just 8.3% in July. These high-ROI companies are using GenAI in areas like product marketing, performance measurement and aligning strategies with business goals.\n\nWhere Intuit focuses is a little different. Thanks to AI tools designed for its customer base, executives highlighted that Intuit\u2019s Online Services revenue grew 19%, driven by growth in money, payroll and Mailchimp offerings; while QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 22% in the quarter, driven by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix-shift.\n\nOne of the primary pain points for small business owners is the time-consuming nature of routine administrative tasks. Financial management, payroll processing and tax compliance are critical but often burdensome responsibilities.\n\nRead more: Amazon Seller Central to Integrate Intuit QuickBooks for Financial Management\n\nBy automating these processes, businesses can save valuable time and reduce the risk of human error. This efficiency not only improves operational productivity but also provides entrepreneurs with more time to innovate and engage with their customers.\n\nThis is supported by findings revealed in \u201cInnovators and Cost Cutters: Growth Strategies for SMBs,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence report, which showed that while 37% of SMBs on average use AI, 51% of those with increasing revenues use it. Businesses with increasing revenues, and those generating more than $1 million in revenue, are twice as likely to use AI as ones with decreasing or stable revenues.\n\nIntuit\u2019s AI-platform, it claims, can auto-fill the majority of tax returns, minimizing manual data entry.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, Intuit\u2019s ability to provide tailored, actionable insights could become a key differentiator. However, with increased reliance on AI, the company must also address concerns around data security and transparency to maintain customer trust.\n\nFor now, Intuit\u2019s announcement is being welcomed by small business communities eager to embrace technologies that can alleviate day-to-day operational challenges. The success of these new tools will likely depend on how seamlessly they integrate into existing workflows and their ability to deliver on the promise of simplicity and efficiency.",

Guidance for next quarter\u2019s revenue was better than expected at $7.58 billion at the midpoint, 1% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its GAAP profit of $1.67 per share was 98.1% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\n\nIs now the time to buy Intuit? Find out in our full research report.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Q4 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $3.96 billion vs analyst estimates of $3.83 billion (17% year-on-year growth, 3.5% beat)\n\nEPS (GAAP): $1.67 vs analyst estimates of $0.84 (98.1% beat)\n\nAdjusted Operating Income: $1.26 billion vs analyst estimates of $999.6 million (31.8% margin, 26.1% beat)\n\nThe company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year of $18.25 billion at the midpoint\n\nOperating Margin: 15%, up from 10.9% in the same quarter last year\n\nFree Cash Flow Margin: 26.2%, up from 10% in the previous quarter\n\nBillings: $4.10 billion at quarter end, up 16.8% year on year\n\nMarket Capitalization: $158.8 billion\n\n\"We are making great progress fueling the financial success of consumers, businesses, and accountants with our AI-driven expert platform,\" said Sasan Goodarzi, Intuit's chief executive officer.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nCreated in 1983 when founder Scott Cook watched his wife struggle to reconcile the family's checkbook, Intuit provides tax and accounting software for small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nTax Software\n\nThe demand for easy to use, integrated cloud based finance software that integrates tax and accounting operations continues to rise in tandem with the difficulty workers find trying to use existing accounting tools like spreadsheets given the growing volume of finance data littered across a multitude of enterprise applications. A related demand driver is the secular increase of e-commerce and rising adoption of modern point of sales and payments platforms which easily integrate with backend financial software.\n\nSales Growth\n\nExamining a company\u2019s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Over the last three years, Intuit grew its sales at a 14.6% annual rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell short of our standards for the software sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds. Luckily, there are other things to like about Intuit.\n\nIntuit Quarterly Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Intuit reported year-on-year revenue growth of 17%, and its $3.96 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 3.5%. Company management is currently guiding for a 12.4% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.",

I'm here with Intuit CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and our CFO, Sandeep Aujla. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements.\n\nThere are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2024, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the investor relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com.

Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nGreat. Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We delivered very strong results in Q2 with revenue growth of 17%, and we're off to a great start in tax. We have strong momentum this year as we execute our global AI-driven expert platform strategy, powering prosperity for consumers and businesses.\n\nWe are confident in delivering double-digit revenue growth and expanding margin this year, and we're reiterating our full year guidance. Today. I will focus on three areas: revolutionizing speed to benefit by delivering done-for-you experiences with expertise, winning in tax, and mid-market. We're making strong progress across our platform with our data and AI investments to deliver done-for-you experiences with AI-powered human expertise.\n\nOur focus is on automating tasks, end-to-end workflows, and entire functions, connecting customers to one of our more than 12,000 AI-powered human experts for the last mile or to complete all of the work. This is Intuit Assist, the combination of AI and AI-powered human experts, digitizing everything for customers and fueling their success. Let me share one example to demonstrate our progress. On our business platform, Intuit Assist delivers done-for-you experiences, automating workflows using AI agents.\n\nIt automatically turns emails, electronic documents, and handwritten notes into estimates, invoices, or bills while doing the accounting in the background. It spots potential cash flow shortages in real time and suggests personalized solutions like applying for a line of credit through QuickBooks Capital. With these capabilities, we're seeing a 10% higher payment conversion rate on overdue invoices when customers use AI-generated invoice reminders versus those that don't. We're also connecting customers to our AI-powered experts at their point of need through QuickBooks live, up 2.5x in Q2, with 20-point higher ecosystem attach rate than the rest of the QBO base.\n\nRepeat engagement with our done-for-you invoicing experience continues to grow and has increased more than 50% since November. As we continue to scale these experiences, we're encouraged by new customers converting and adoption of platform offerings, such as payments and QuickBooks Live. This is Intuit Assist working at scale, fueling the success of our customers. Turning to tax, we're off to a great start.\n\nOur strategy is to win as an AI-driven expert platform by delivering the best experience, speed to money, and best price for customers. As one consumer platform with a seamless customer experience across TurboTax and Credit Karma, we have incredible scale to win in the DIY and assisted categories. We've made significant progress with Intuit Assist, which is fueled by our data, data services, and AI investments, delivering done-for-you tax experiences. We have transformed the shopping experience, helping guide customers to the offering that is best for them, which is driving higher starts.\n\nFor those that choose to do their own taxes, we're delivering an AI-driven, highly personalized product experience. This includes easy data in from over 200 partners now covering 90% of our customers, most common tax documents, up from 68% last year. And with the intelligent application of data to personalize navigation, customers can complete their taxes more quickly with higher levels of confidence. When customers choose us to do their taxes for them, we match them with the best expert on our AI-driven expert platform within seconds and share the expert's qualifications while automatically uploading the customer's data, making the first interaction a wow experience; an AI-powered human expert that completes the customer's return in less than two hours, offering proactive and personalized assistance and providing the opportunity for customers to access their money immediately, all the while on the go or in the comfort of their home.\n\nThe experience is resonating, and the TurboTax Live Full Service has a product recommendation score of 84 season to date, one of the highest at Intuit. This is an unmatched experience at scale, delivering delight and speed to money at the best price. With the scale of our data and AI capabilities, Intuit Assist is the control tower, automating tasks and workflows, with human experts engaging where needed to deliver done-for-you experiences for our customers. Let's shift to our durable go-to-market approach.\n\nWe have reinvented our marketing campaigns focused on experience, speed to money, and price. We've strengthened our overall AI-driven personalized lineup and monetization capabilities. We are seeing great traction early in the season in DIY across simple and complex customers with strong monetization driven by benefits such as early access to refunds and AI-powered human experts. In the assisted category, with the significant improvement in experience, speed to money, and our beat your price campaign, our early full service funnel is strong.\n\nThis is driven by marketing that started in the fall and improvements in local search for those looking for a pro near them. We estimate that our local experts in 130-plus designated market areas will give us access to approximately 80% of the nationwide assisted filers, and we found that filers are historically 5x more likely to convert when given a local option. We are also seeing more than 3x higher starts on the Credit Karma platform, driven by an increase in availability of seamless zero click login to TurboTax, from 5% last season to 70% this season. In summary, we're off to a strong start in tax.\n\nWe're seeing strong growth across simple and more complex returns as the season progresses and strong overall average revenue per filer. We're also pleased with the power of one consumer platform, given the seamless experiences across TurboTax and Credit Karma. Let me now turn to the business platform and the progress we're making serving mid-market customers, which represent an $89 billion TAM. We are focused on winning as an AI-driven expert platform to fuel the success of customers with QBO Advanced, Intuit Enterprise Suite, and our ecosystem of services.\n\nOur go-to-market and product investments are fueling accelerated progress. With the QBO Advanced platform, we are delivering strong ARPC across our broader ecosystem of services with payroll and payments penetration exceeding QBO Core by 12 points and 9 points respectively at the end of the quarter. With Intuit Enterprise Suite, we are seeing growing momentum week to week. This includes the number of contracts we signed in January, which are up 2x versus November.\n\nIES is resonating with larger businesses and accountants across our ecosystem, particularly those with over 10 million in revenue where win rates are trending nearly 2x higher versus smaller customers. And the efficiency of our sales funnel continues to improve with sales productivity up more than 60% over the last two months. We are winning because of the valuable benefits of our platform, ease of adoption, price, and total cost of ownership. With IES, we're able to boost customers productivity by saving them time and providing deeper insights across the platform to fuel their growth.\n\nWe are seeing traction with mid-market customers extending across multiple industries, including construction, IT services, legal services, management consulting, finance, and insurance. I'll share two examples that highlight our excitement in fueling customer success and Intuit growth. We recently signed a financial services firm with five entities that chose IES over other competing solutions to optimize its financial operations, marketing, and sales with AI, all in one place. The firm is using Mailchimp, an integral part of IES to optimize sales and marketing by leveraging the insights from dimensional reporting to assess product mix and view profitability by product type.\n\nThe marketing and sales teams tell us they are obsessed with the insights which enable them to get the most out of Mailchimp with more targeted customer engagement to fuel their growth. We also signed a deal with a large professional services and accounting firm, which serves clients across 13 industries, including construction, dental, government contracting, real estate, and technology. This firm was looking to standardize solutions and consolidate across vendors, and our disruptive price and ease of use was key to their purchasing decision. They migrated several clients, including some using competitive solutions, to IES in a deal worth six figures annually, and we are partnering with them to bring many more clients onto IES.\n\nWrapping up, with our progress and momentum, we are well-positioned to win as an end-to-end platform with done-for-you experiences that fuel the success of consumers, small and mid-market businesses, and accountants. Now, let me hand it over to Sandeep.\n\nSandeep Aujla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Sasan. We delivered a strong second quarter of fiscal 2025 across the company. Our second quarter results include revenue of 4 billion, up 17%; GAAP operating income of 593 million versus 369 million last year, up 61%; non-GAAP operating income of 1.3 billion versus 1 billion last year, up 26%; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.67 versus $1.25 a year ago, up 34%; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.32 versus $2.63 last year, up 26%. Now, let me turn to our business segments, starting with our global business solutions group.\n\nOur business platform helps customers to run and grow their business end to end. Global business solutions group revenue grew 19% during Q2, driven by online ecosystem revenue growth of 21%, or 25% excluding Mailchimp. The momentum in our online ecosystem is demonstrating the power of our business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings as customers look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 22% in Q2, driven by higher effective prices, customer growth, and mix shift.\n\nWe continue to prioritize disrupting the mid-market through ongoing focus on both go-to-market motions and product innovations, which we expect to drive ARPC growth. Online services revenue grew 19% in Q2, or 30% excluding Mailchimp. Growth in Q2 was driven by money, which includes payments, capital and bill pay, payroll, and Mailchimp. Within money, revenue growth in the quarter reflects payments revenue growth, which was driven by customer growth and increase in total payment volume per customer and higher effective prices and QuickBooks capital revenue growth.\n\nTotal online payment volume growth in Q2 was 18%. Within payroll, the revenue growth in the quarter reflects customer growth, mix shift, and higher effective prices. Within Mailchimp, revenue growth in the quarter was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth. We are making early progress with product improvements but continue to expect it to take several quarters to deliver improved outcomes at scale.\n\nAs a reminder, in Q2, we began lapping the price changes we made in Q2 of last year, which drove a deceleration in growth this quarter versus Q1. We remain confident in and are executing on our vision of an end-to-end business platform that integrates the power of Mailchimp and QuickBooks. This is enabling our customers to both run and grow their business all in one place. Third, we are executing our international strategy, which includes leading with our connected business platform in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets.\n\nAs we continue to execute on a localized product and lineup. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 9% in Q2, or 19% excluding Mailchimp. As we have previously shared, we win as a platform company. Our online ecosystem revenue growth reflects the progress we are making with our strategy of serving both small and midsized businesses with more complex needs.\n\nThis represents an addressable market of over $180 billion, roughly half of which is mid-market. In Q2, online ecosystem revenue grew 21%, including approximately 40% growth in online ecosystem revenue for QBO Advanced and Intuit Enterprise Suite that serves mid-market. Online ecosystem revenue for small businesses and the rest of the base grew a strong 18%. We are excited about our progress in serving mid-market customers while continuing to focus on smaller businesses.\n\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect online ecosystem revenue in total to grow approximately 20% in fiscal 2025. Turning to desktop, during Q2, desktop ecosystem revenue grew 14%, and desktop enterprise revenue grew in the high teens. As a reminder, quarterly desktop ecosystem revenue growth trends in fiscal 2025 reflect the offering changes we made in early fiscal 2024 to complete the transition to a recurring subscription model, including more frequent product updates. We continue to expect desktop ecosystem revenue to grow in the low single digits in fiscal 2025.\n\nTurning to our consumer platform, our consumer platform is helping customers make smart money decisions, take steps to improve their financial health year round, achieve their best tax outcome, and get their tax refund faster. Consumer group revenue grew 3%, ahead of our guidance for a low single-digit decline in Q2. Our strategy is to win as an AI-driven expert platform by delivering the best experience, speed to money, and best price for customers. As one consumer platform with a seamless customer experience across TurboTax and Credit Karma, we have incredible scale to win in the DIY and assisted tax categories.\n\nWe are off to a strong start in tax this season and are reiterating our guidance for consumer group of 7% to 8% revenue growth in fiscal 2025. Turning to the pro tax group, the revenue was $272 million in Q2, down 1%. Shifting to Credit Karma. Credit Karma revenue growth accelerated again this quarter to 36%, reflecting strength in credit cards, personal loans, and auto insurance.\n\nOn a product basis, credit cards accounted for 15 points of growth, personal loans accounted for 14 points, and auto insurance accounted for 6 points. As a reminder, starting in Q3, we are lapping the strong growth in auto insurance that began a year ago. We are pleased with our early results this tax season as we execute on our vision for one consumer platform with a seamless customer experience across TurboTax and Credit Karma. Let me now touch briefly on our investments in AI and how they are benefiting our operations.\n\nIn addition to the AI-driven experiences we are delivering for our customers to fuel their success that Sasan spoke to earlier, we are also leveraging AI to operate more efficiently and increase productivity internally. Within our customer success organization, our investments in AI capabilities have delivered nearly $90 million in annualized efficiencies in the first half of the year. That's because we are leveraging AI for expert training, matching customers to experts, automating workforce operations, and eliminating data entry. We're using AI agents to deliver done-for-you experiences, and this has contributed to a 20% reduction in the contact rate for TurboTax product support year to date.\n\nThis is Intuit Assist working at scale. We're also seeing improved coding productivity with up to 40% faster coding using AI code assistants, driving faster innovation for our customers. In summary, I am pleased with our momentum this fiscal year and our opportunities ahead. Shifting to our balance sheet and capital allocation.\n\nOur financial principles guide our decisions, they remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately 2.5 billion in cash and investments and 6.3 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We recently entered into a 4.5 billion revolving credit facility that we are using to fund our five-day early refund offering. This facility expires on April 30, 2025.\n\nWe repurchased 721 million of stock during the second quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter to offset dilution from share-based compensation over a three-year period. The board approved a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share payable on April 18th, 2025. This represents a 16% increase per share versus last year.\n\nMoving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2025 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 12% to 13%, GAAP operating income growth of 28% to 30%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 13% to 14%, GAAP diluted earnings-per-share growth of 18% to 20%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings-per-share growth of 13% to 14%. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 includes total company revenue growth of 12% to 13%, GAAP earnings per share of $9.22 to $9.28, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $10.89 to $10.95.\n\nBuilding on our strong Q2 results and robust Q3 guidance, we are highly confident in the continued strength and positive trajectory of our business through Q4 and beyond. With the majority of the tax season still ahead, we are well-positioned to deliver strong results and look forward to sharing an updated full year outlook on our next earnings call, in line with our usual practice. You can find our full fiscal 2025 and Q3 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nGreat. Thank you, Sandeep. We're very confident in our long-term growth strategy, including double-digit revenue growth and operating income growing faster than revenue. We like our momentum in the first half of the fiscal year which sets us up for a solid second half.\n\nLooking ahead, we're confident in our momentum and the progress that we are seeing with Intuit Assist, delivering done-for-you experiences with AI-powered human experts, increasing our 5% penetration of a $300 billion total addressable market. We have an incredible runway ahead. With that, let's now open it up to your questions.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator instructions] We'll go first to Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nSiti Panigrahi -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Congratulations on a great quarter. Of course, now, this is a focus on taxes. And at this point, Sasan, what's driving your increasing confidence to deliver that 7% to 8%, you know, guidance for consumer? Any color on the trends that you are seeing in the assisted category since you started promotion this year early on in October? Also, if you could cover in the same -- you know, we hear some concern about those initiatives.\n\nWondering how Intuit can drive efficiency for IRS?\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks for the question, Siti. You know, first of all, I'll just start with our strength is really across both DIY and the assisted category. We're actually seeing very strong traction with both simple and complex filers in DIY.\n\nAnd based on all of our innovation, actually, you know, monetization is very strong with, you know, things like access to expert help in the DIY category and access to money. So, our repositioning of the lineup has actually really helped us accelerate paid growth. So, we feel good in the DIY category. In assisted, you know, listen, it's really end to end, you know, all the work from reinventing our campaign, which is really resonating in terms of what it means to digitally get your taxes done from anywhere with the best experience, immediate access to your money and the best price.\n\nSo, from really -- from campaign to all the work that we've done to begin to show up nearly 80% of the assisted filers and where they, you know, hold their homes, we're -- you know, we're within a short radius of their homes, all the way to the experience. We've completely revamped the experience. Just as a reminder, you know, when an expert connects to one of our customers, the conversion rate is 80%. And with all of our data and AI investments, we're able to use our algorithms to match customers to experts within seconds; immediately get the expert to engage with the customer; while they're engaging, upload all of their data so that the expert can deliver value immediately; and then, get their taxes done in less than two hours.\n\nBut this is -- by the way, this is across consumer and business. And so, our funnel is strong from the campaigns that we started in the fall and all the work that we've done leveraging data and AI and with our experiences and given where we are. So, it's a combination of all of our choices and decisions all really powered by data and AI that gives us confidence, Siti, in our guidance. The second thing, you know, around DOGE, I would just reiterate, you know our ongoing and my personal ongoing engagement with the administration, even as late as just a couple of weeks ago.\n\nAnd they're very focused on significantly reducing waste, reducing fraud, and eliminating bureaucracy. And there's many areas where we're talking about, you know, contributing and helping them with their goals. And with that said, you know, their focus is to really drive that elimination of tax fraud, waste, overhead cost in IRS. And those are the actions that they're very focused on taking, and we are very focused on helping the administration in any way possible.\n\nAnd we don't see, by the way, any, you know, risk to the IRS providing services to consumers and businesses with some of the actions that have been taken. So, hopefully, that answers your question. We're quite excited about our progress and quite bullish about the rest of the season.\n\nSiti Panigrahi -- Analyst\n\nThat's super helpful, Sasan. I'm going to stick to one question. Thank you.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nKirk Materne -- Analyst\n\nHi. Yeah. Thanks very much and congrats on the good quarter. Sasan.\n\njust wondering if you could talk a little bit about just the SMB or the small business environment. I think we all came into this year, you know, hoping that we'd be seeing a little bit of green shoots in terms of the economic activity level. Has anything changed on that front in your view just given some of the macro, you know, dislocation, perhaps, you know, questions around tariffs, things like that? I was just kind of curious if you could give us a little bit of an update on what you're seeing on the small business side right now. Thanks.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nYeah. Sure, Kirk. I would just say it remains very stable in terms of just the macro environment for businesses. If I give you a click down, the smaller businesses, you know, up to about 10 employees, sort of 2.5 million, 3 million in revenue.\n\nOn our platform, you know, their profits and cash flows are up year over year. Of course, as you know, we're not overly concentrated in any particular industry. It differs a little bit by industry. But overall, that should be your takeaway for the smaller businesses.\n\nThe larger businesses, sort of 3 million and above, 10 million, and to 50 million, 100 million-plus, the mid-market customers that we serve, they're actually very much looking toward digitization, looking toward being able to save time, finding ways to drive both their revenue growth and profitability. And I would say same goes for our accountant partners that also serve these businesses. And that's really where Intuit Enterprise Suite comes in and the power of Intuit Enterprise Suite because these larger businesses and based on the proof now that we have with customers using IES, they actually want to lean into it because they can see with our AI-powered experiences, they have a partner by their side, an assistant that can help them grow their business and are actually leading -- leaning into digitization because it leads into their growth. So, we're seeing even, you know, healthier environment the larger the businesses get.\n\nKirk Materne -- Analyst\n\nThanks, Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nYep. Very welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Weiss -- Analyst\n\nThank you, guys, for taking the question, and congratulations on a really solid quarter. Maybe one for Sandeep on the expense side of the equation. Coming into this year, you guys had made room for more aggressive investment to sort of get the skill sets needed on board for you guys to sort of progress on your plans on a go-forward basis. Thus far, in the first half and definitely in this quarter, we saw really impressive margin expansion, a lot of leverage showing up on that bottom line.\n\nIs that in any way due to maybe expense timing? Because -- are you guys still planning on basically like hiring back the same type of headcount levels that we were talking about when we came into the year? Or is there, perhaps, more sort of opportunity for drive and leverage than we're thinking about earlier?\n\nSandeep Aujla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nHey, Keith. Thanks for that question. You know, the -- let me address the question both on the hiring aspect and then also on the margin aspect. On the hiring, we are -- we saw really good take rate on -- in terms of recruiting in the first two quarters of the year.\n\nIn fact, it was ahead of even our internal expectations in terms of just the reputation the firm has and how many people we were able to attract to the company in a short order of time. In terms of our expectation for the year, consistent with what we have shared before, I expect it to be flat to slightly up for the year as we continue to lean into investing in areas that are key to our future growth and also using AI internally to drive efficiency in terms of our employees. In terms of the broader question around our expenses and our margin expansion, look, we are committed to driving margin expansion over the long term. And I feel super confident in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we've given for margin expansion this year.\n\nAnd really, the trends you've seen year to date come down to three things. One is day-in, day-out expense discipline we have across this company. And that shows up in every aspect of how we allocate our dollars and the ROI we expect from those dollars. Secondly, the efficiencies from implementation of AI in our customer success, that came in a bit earlier than what we had internally forecasted.\n\nSo, that was a good trend that we saw. And lastly, with the slower start to the tax season, that also aided a bit in Q2. So, net-net, you should look at Q2 as further solidifying our confidence in our margin for this year and beyond.\n\nKeith Weiss -- Analyst\n\nGot it. And just to clarify on point number one, on the hiring, it sounds like you're hiring is going to plan, so there wasn't like an outperformance in Q2 margins that came from the late hiring in any sense.\n\nSandeep Aujla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nWell, no. We -- you know, we had good hiring take rates, and we hired a little less than what we thought we would need just given the efficiencies we saw, such as 40% higher productivity of engineers using gen AI tools. So, stuff I talked about on AI implementation in CES where we saw 20% lower call volume from TurboTax just as we implemented done-for-you experiences. So, there are a plethora of things such as that that led to us needing fewer people than we thought we would need, but that should be the key areas that you should take away in terms of hiring trends.\n\nKeith Weiss -- Analyst\n\nExcellent. Super helpful. Thank you, guys.\n\nSandeep Aujla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nBrent Thill -- Analyst\n\nThanks. Sasan, I know you launched some clever and innovative new marking early into the tax season. I'm curious if you've seen any early signs of different reaction or traction. What has been the response? And is it -- does it give you a little more confidence heading into this tax season based on what you're seeing from that? Any color would be helpful.\n\nThanks.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nYeah, Brent. Thank you for the question. The short answer is yes. Based on where we are and what we've seen, it does give us just a lot of confidence in the flywheel that we're creating in the assisted segment.\n\nYou know, to double click. it's really the combination of continuing to raise awareness in the market around really three benefits that matters a lot to those that spend over $35 billion, whether it's businesses or consumers, to get somebody else to get their taxes done for them. You know, one is about experience. It's from the ease of wherever you are virtually and the fact that we can get it done-for-you in less than a couple of hours -- some, by the way, in, you know, 30 minutes -- and with immediate access to your money at the best price.\n\nAnd just given our scale with all of the data and AI investments that we've made, and you think about us competing with, you know, a lot of, I would just say, smaller players because the majority of our competition is, you know, several hundred thousand, you know, very local tax firms and tax pros, the experience -- the scale in which we can deliver the experience, the price, and ultimately, immediate access to money is just really very attractive for both consumers and businesses. And, you know, the punchline is the accumulation of what we started in the fall around beat your price because we know that there is a segment of customers that actually make their decision in the fall to what we've carried through to where we sit today. Our funnel is actually quite strong. That's number one.\n\nNumber two, our experience is significantly improved, given -- you know, the best way I would put it is when you hear us talk about experience improvement, we finally made the shift from being a software provider to disrupt the assisted segment to being a service provider, which means that, you know, we're not just leading with software where these customers have to do the work, we're doing all the work for them with the expert engaging customers right upfront. And we're just seeing the accumulation of all of that, given where we are in season, and are excited about the next six weeks.\n\nBrent Thill -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nVery welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Steve Enders with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Enders -- Analyst\n\nOK, great. Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess I wanted to ask just on the strength that maybe you're seeing in the advanced and the enterprise suite side of the equation. Just how are you thinking about, you know, the productivity rates of the sales force that you've built out, how you're thinking about further investments and just kind of how you're viewing that opportunity to move up market further and invest behind the, you know, the strength you're seeing there?\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nYeah. Well, a couple of things I would say. You know, one, you know, every day that passes our sales folks are getting more productive because of just the timing of, you know, when we hired them, the timing of when we launched Intuit Enterprise Suite. You know, it was just, you know, literally last fall that we launched it, you know, and went GA.\n\nAnd, of course, prior to that we were hiring and ramping up our sales folks. So, you know, as we touched on earlier, we've actually seen a 60% productivity improvement in the last couple of months just with our sales folks, which is just sort of a natural progression. But I would also say, in many ways, I don't want to downplay it, but it's an easier sell because of the experience, because of the total cost of ownership, and because of how competitive it is on price. I think the big shift that we are now accelerating is really coverage of our large accountant partners.\n\nYou know, we initially started really focusing on talking to the businesses. We are now accelerating and shifting to making sure that our large accountant partners can actually play around with Intuit Enterprise Suite because they are -- it's going viral. They're hearing about it. So, giving them a sandbox to do that, you know, coming up with a pricing framework because, you know, these large accounting firms may have up to 15 different practices, from real estate to construction, to manufacturing, to technology, to IT services, and just having really a framework to focus by practice to, in essence, offer Intuit Enterprise Suite to their customers.\n\nAnd that's the area where I would say we're accelerating our coverage. But the productivity is significantly improving, and it's something that that we watch for. You know, this is a business where we don't want to overly focus on optimization because we're scaling it, and the growth is exciting. But at the same time, the productivity of the sales folks is really important.\n\nI don't know, Sandeep, if you would add anything.\n\nSandeep Aujla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nSteve, a couple of points I would add is that what we look at internally is that we want to make sure that each cohort of salespeople coming in is more productive than the prior, and each cohort is laddering up faster than the prior cohort in terms of their productivity. Secondly, when we look at these investments, we also want to make sure that we're investing in the right industry specialization, as well as product specialization, because we see better close rate when we bring in people with those specializations. And lastly, let me touch on AI because AI also is a big contributor here to driving productivity. What we are able to do with implementing AI across our sales desk is we are able to give them the next best action based on where they are in the sales process.\n\nWe're able to give them the right talk track to address the customer's need or to address what competitive solution they are using aka what the battle card could be for the product offering. So, there are multiple areas that we look at to drive efficiency. And the stats that we are looking at, we're being disciplined and feeling really good about the improvements we are seeing in our productivity.\n\nSteve Enders -- Analyst\n\nOK. Great to hear. Thanks for taking the questions here.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nOf course.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nKash Rangan -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thank you very much, and congratulations on the results. And, Sasan, I can always count on you to be the beacon of hope for SMBs. So, I know that you have been progressively feeling better and better about the SMB spending environment.\n\nIf you take a step back, online ecosystem was barely a blip on your income statement. Now, it's a multi-billion dollar business unit, right? So, near term, longer term, how should we think about the online ecosystem revenue? And within that, QBO Advanced certainly seems to be off to a good start. What is your dream scenario? What would make you ecstatic as to the outcome of QBO Advanced? How big of a business could that be? And although it's a little bit too early, but if you dream the dream, how big of a business could IES be within the confines of Intuit? Thank you so much.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nWell, Kash, thanks for your question. We love the dream, and we love to execute. So, I love the nature of your question. You know, a couple of things I would say.\n\nOne, if you just look at the size and scale of our business group, well north of, you know, 11 billion in terms of the way we've guided this year, we expect the business group to continue to grow overall between 15% to 20%. And, you know, the majority of that is really driven by online growth because, you know, we continue to expect that, you know, desktop will be very, very low single digits as you think about the future. So, that's the first takeaway is look at this franchise as growing 15% to 20%, which means that the online portion, which is the largest portion, should continue to grow at a healthy rate. I think to answer your question, when you look at the total size of the addressable market, which, for the business group is nearly 200 billion, half of that is mid-market.\n\nAnd it's the way we've defined mid-market today, which does not mean it will stand as is. And what I mean by that is today, you know, really anything north of 3 million in revenue in terms of a business, all the way up to a couple of hundred million, the other way to look at it is up to like a couple of hundred employees, is the way we've defined mid-market. And that's about 100 billion in TAM, and that's where QBO Advanced, Intuit Enterprise Suite, and all the services truly as a platform, you know, come in. You know, we believe mid-market one day will be bigger than the entire business group.\n\nThat's why we started talking about the growth rate of mid-market separately because it's an area where we're getting great traction. It's an area where we have actually more confidence today than even five years ago when we declared disrupting mid-market, given our expansion of our innovation on the platform but also our go-to-market. And -- and we're not going to stop at a couple of hundred million in revenue. We believe we have so much more room.\n\nAnd we just have so much more confidence sitting here today than even, you know, last fall because we're in market with Intuit Enterprise Suite. And we can see how we're winning on experience total cost of ownership and price. And by the way, there's still a lot that we're adding to the platform. There's still areas where we have work to do, which actually excites us based on the progress that we're seeing and then what's possible.\n\nSo, you know, we think, you know, mid-market is just, you know, for the next 10 years is going to be a significant growth driver. And we believe it will be the largest over-time driver of growth for the business group, while we continue, by the way, to serve those that are new entrants in the business market because we want to grow with them. So, the dream is it will be far bigger than the business group is today, and we're excited about our potential.\n\nKash Rangan -- Analyst\n\nLove the dream, love the execution even more. Thank you.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nYeah. Very welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\n\nUnknown speaker -- -- Analyst\n\nHey. This is Patrick on for Alex. Can you help us contextualize the result in Credit Karma as it's the second quarter in a row with a pretty large outperformance relative to consensus? What are you seeing there that's providing such strength in the segment? And then given the first half of the year, was there any consideration to update the annual guidance? If not, why not? Thank you.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nYeah, sure. So, first of all, I would just start by reminding everyone, you know, our strategy is really about the one consumer platform and winning is one consumer platform, which is all of the, I would say, great execution of the team with the integration of Credit Karma and TurboTax because our goal is from helping you build credit to helping you build wealth and, in the middle, helping you manage your money and get your taxes done. So, that's ultimately what we're focused on with one consumer platform. And all of our innovation is one consumer platform at particularly all of it sitting on top of all of our data and AI investments, where we've dramatically improved, you know, the shopping experience for members where we, in essence, help you make buying decisions, whether it's insurance, whether it's personal loans, whether it's credit cards, whether it's connecting you to taxes.\n\nAnd so, when you look at, you know, our accelerated growth rate, probably 40% is macro, things are just better versus last year, 60% is execution. And we love our trajectory. More importantly, we love the integration that we've done with TurboTax because for us, everything is about helping customers manage their money and helping them get their taxes done. And lastly, I would just say that, you know, this is a segment in the long run that we would expect to grow 10% to 15%.\n\nOverall, we would expect our consumer platform, right, the combination of TurboTax and Credit Karma to grow double digits. And that's the purpose, you know, that it serves. And as you heard, Sandeep touched on this, and I'll then turn it over to him for any additional insights, given where we are in the year, we'll look at updating our guidance after Q3.\n\nSandeep Aujla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nOK, Patrick. The only couple of things I would add is in addition to the partner confidence we are seeing and the better together experience across our consumer platform, we are also seeing the AI experiences we embedded across Credit Karma, drive better shopping experiences, and better ARPC. So, that's also aiding in the trends you're seeing there. And lastly, as you look ahead and model out the rest of the year, just keep in mind that last year, Credit Karma started with a negative 5% growth rate in Q1 and exited at plus 14 in Q4.\n\nSo, the comps in the back half of the year for Credit Karma do get more challenging. So, please do take that into account as you model out the rest of the year.\n\nUnknown speaker -- -- Analyst\n\nSuper helpful. Thank you.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nVery welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Brad Sills with Bank of America.\n\nBrad Sills -- Analyst\n\nOh, great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question on tax. As we're heading into the tax season here, you've talked about the effort to advertise to the full service filer in that CPA segment.\n\nWanted to get any perspective on how that might be tracking. Are there any leading indicators that suggest you're seeing the traction there in the full service segment as a result of some of the ads we've all seen on TV? And just general outlook for full service as we head into the season. Thank you.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nYeah, sure. Thank you for your question. You know, a couple of things I would just say, this is the strength of that we are seeing in the funnel and and really how we're feeling about the rest of the year is really a combination of reinventing our end to end, from campaign to the experience, focused on three things. One is the best experience that you could have virtually, the second is immediate access to your money, third is the best price.\n\nAnd really, our campaign of showing how taxes are different virtually where you can get immediate access to your money and get your taxes done faster than anybody else can do it has really had -- that coupled with our campaign that started in the fall has really had a positive impact on building out our funnel. Plus, we really have revamped our full service experience. You know, one of the things I mentioned earlier was that, you know, the big change, the big from-to in our experience this year is we shifted from a software company to a services company as it relates to disrupting the assisted segment. And what that really means is, even last year, we were still having full service customers do a lot of the work, as if they're doing it themselves.\n\nThis year, we now, within seconds, match an expert with a customer in the background. We are ingesting all of their data. And within minutes, the expert is delivering real insights to the customer and, while the customer is on the go, getting their taxes done in sometimes as little as 30 minutes. So, just from campaign to the experience and being disruptive in our price, we're seeing strength in the funnel.\n\nWe're quite bullish about the rest of the year. And I'll just end with, for us, it's about the assisted category. It's about the experiences across do-it-with-me and full service where we're seeing end-to-end strength.\n\nBrad Sills -- Analyst\n\nVery exciting. Thank you, Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nYeah. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Alex Markgraf with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n\nAlex Markgraff -- Analyst\n\nHey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Sandeep, could you maybe just talk about the consumer group result. As you noted, better than guided.\n\nJust curious kind of what surprised particularly in the context of a slower start to the season. Thank you.\n\nSandeep Aujla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Alex. A couple of things, did better than expectation on our consumer group. One is we just saw, as Sasan pointed out, a strong start to the year in terms of TurboTax Online, as well as the average revenue per return.\n\nAs more customers engage with an expert and as they added on offerings, including getting, you know, audit defense and faster access to their refund, that was a key driver in terms of both the units, as well as the ARPR that we experienced that drove the results better than what we had guided you all to.\n\nAlex Markgraff -- Analyst\n\nAnd just to clarify, no sort of change in expected seasonality as you're modeling the business. Is that a fair statement?\n\nSandeep Aujla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nNo expected seasonality. If you're referring to -- I mean, you know, the IRS opened on the 27th. I'm assuming you're taking that into account in terms of the seasonality. But we don't expect any seasonality.\n\nAnd even some of the questions we get around the unfortunate events in L.A. with the fires, we expect that to be nonmaterial impact to our Q3.\n\nAlex Markgraff -- Analyst\n\nYeah. OK, great. Thank you for the answer.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Taylor McGinnis with UBS.\n\nTaylor McGinnis -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe I'll ask on the online services business because I think you said that that accelerated to 30% growth excluding Mailchimp, which is really solid.\n\nSo, when we think about the growth potential of online services in the second half, can you just unpack that a little bit more? So, is the acceleration, you know, really being driven maybe by scaling in the AP payments business? Is it possible, as that continues, you know, we continue -- we could continue to see 30% plus growth potential? And then, maybe just as like the offset with Mailchimp, I think you mentioned that we're going to be lapping some pricing changes. So, is it possible that we start to see some declines in that business? Thanks.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nYeah. Maybe, Taylor, I'll kick us off and tag team with Sandeep. I think the strength that you're seeing is really the strength of the platform with all of our money offerings, whether it's payments, with estimates and invoicing, to AP with bill pay, to line a credit, right? All -- we now have instant deposit. We now have, really, a very large set of money offerings that our businesses can leverage to be able to manage their cash flow and manage their business.\n\nAnd I would also say, you know, we're starting to see our AI-driven experiences fuel what's possible when it comes to our money growth. So, that's sort of number one. But number two is also payroll. We're seeing, you know, great mix in payroll, great strength in payroll.\n\nAnd again, it all comes down to the strength of our platform. And particularly, as we look at mid-market, you know, one of the things we touched on earlier with QBO Advanced and Intuit Enterprise Suite, which serves the mid-market, particularly with QBO Advanced, the attach of payroll and payments is 12 points and 9 points, respectively, higher than QBO Core. So, that's the strength of that that you are seeing across all of our services. And on Mailchimp, as you know, we talked about earlier, there are price increases that we're lapping.\n\nAnd we also just wanted to really call out the strength of our services minus Mailchimp while we bring Mailchimp to the level of growth that we expect. Sandeep, would you add anything?\n\nSandeep Aujla -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYou know, Taylor, the only thing I would add on the payment and the payroll side is this is finally us engaging with the customer and across those offerings as a holistic money offering and a holistic workforce solution offering. And this is what happens when you get the product teams and the go-to-market teams actually engaging as a one holistic portfolio. So, that's really driving the strength, and that shows up, as you noted that -- as we shared that payment volume was up 18% this quarter. And as you recall, it was 17% last quarter.\n\nSo, it's starting to show up in the results. And looking forward, as Sasan shared, mid-market should be an increasing contributor to this. Not just because of the higher tax rate he mentioned, but these customers are larger so they're also bringing more volume onto our platform.\n\nTaylor McGinnis -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the thoughts.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nVery welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Rishi Jaluria with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nRishi Jaluria -- Analyst\n\nOh, wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Nice to see continued success in the business. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on is IES.\n\nReally nice to see the traction here. Maybe if you were to think about some of the early customer wins that you highlighted during your prepared remarks, are you typically landing greenfield with a lot of these opportunities? Or are there some wins that you have where you're consolidating budget and displacing a number of different point solutions? And maybe alongside that, when we think about early customer feedback, have there been any push points on additional functionality that customers are looking for that informs your future roadmap with IES? Thanks.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nYeah. Tanks for the question, and I'll try to hit on all the different elements that you asked about. You know, first of all, I'll start with, this is a $90 billion, you know, total addressable market that we are going after. And we have about 800,000 of these customers already in our base, and these -- they have -- these 800,000 have the characteristics of larger businesses, over 2.5 million revenue, multi-entity that have a need for either QBO Advanced and/or Intuit Enterprise suite? So, you know, first and foremost, where we've started has been really focused on our own base and focused on our accountant partners.\n\nAnd that's where we've seen, you know, the momentum and the acceleration. And in those cases, we have, in fact, displaced point solutions for sure because the power of Intuit Enterprise Suite from the lens of the customer is when all of their -- the work that they do, from estimate to invoicing to payments to bill pay to payroll to time tracking, depending on the type of business, when it's all in one place, we then can leverage all of our AI capabilities to actually make recommendations to the customer that can help them make growth decisions to resource reallocate based on how different segments are performing. So, the customer is actually motivated to switch from all their point solutions to Intuit Enterprise Suite. That's really number one.\n\nNumber two, they see significant cost savings and time savings when they do that because, generally, although they will pay more than they pay us today, if they are an existing customer, they'll pay significantly more with Intuit Enterprise Suite. They actually end up saving money when they go from different point solutions into an enterprise suite. And what we're starting to see is actually accountants and businesses that are on competitive solutions come to us and want to switch to Enterprise Suite just because of, again, the ease of experience, it's very user friendly, the total cost of ownership, and ultimately, the price. So, with all of that said, you know, the majority has been just focused on our own base, but we are beginning to shift to not only going after those that are greenfield.\n\nAnd greenfield, by the way, means that you're just using a bunch of different apps. None of the apps talk to each other. You're spending a lot of money, but you don't really know how your business is performing. So, switching to one digital platform.\n\nWe consider that nonconsumption in greenfield, and that's where the majority of the money is spent in the TAM, and that's where the majority of our opportunity will come from as we sort of look at the next several years.\n\nRishi Jaluria -- Analyst\n\nAll right, wonderful. Thank you.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nVery welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our last question today comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Schneeberger -- Analyst\n\nThanks very much. Yeah, it's a tax question essentially, too, revenue per return in spirit. The first part, Sasan, you changed your TurboTax Live Full Service pricing to the traditional tiers that you've used with other products, more to form-based pricing. And you noted a very high customer experience for in full service.\n\nJust curious how that's being received. Do you think it's the right formula now for that product? And then, the follow-up question is, 1099 case this year, now that we're about a month into the tax season, are you seeing the pickup there with the lower threshold for those to go out? And how might that have an impact on revenue per return in this tax season if, in fact, you are seeing that significant volume pick up? Thanks so much.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nYeah, Scott. Thanks for your question. Let me make one -- a couple of broader points. You know, one of the things that we've done this year based on all of our investments in data and AI is we actually have AI-driven personalized lineup experiences.\n\nSo, that, you know, for instance, if you go on our any of our front doors and look to see what our lineup is, and if Sandeep and I go, we're all going to see very different things. And so, the days of the past where there was a lineup, and everybody sees the same lineup, no longer exists. And it's important for you to know that because, you know, we've gotten a lot of questions like, for instance, on our standard SKU. The reality is many people don't even see our standard SKU.\n\nIt's customers with certain situations where our data and AI platform will land them in the right experience. That's partly why we're actually getting, you know, I would say very strong traction with both simple and complex filers on how we're monetizing because we're really putting customers in the right experiences. And that really -- that comment transcends into the assisted segment, which is why I wanted to start there. And to answer your question, I mean I think the product recommendation score says a lot.\n\nAn 85 product recommendation score is just one of the highest in any industry. And our experience, our price, and access to money is very much resonating with full service customers, and we're actually quite excited about, you know, the rest of the season. And that, by the way, includes small businesses. We're seeing nice uptake with small businesses that are using full service, not just consumers.\n\nAnd last thing is just both the comment that Sandeep made earlier because we've gotten questions on it in 1099. The unfortunate situation in L.A., 1099, we just think it's immaterial. We may see a lot of uptake the rest of the season, but we -- we don't -- we view both of them as immaterial.\n\nScott Schneeberger -- Analyst\n\nAll right. Thanks for sharing that. Congrats on the quarter.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nYeah. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's question-and-answer period. I will now turn the call back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nAwesome. Well, thank you so much for all the great questions. And be safe out there, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter.

            "content": "The stock of Intuit (INTU) is up 5% after the business software company reported Fiscal second quarter financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts across the board.\n\nThe Silicon Valley-based company whose products include TurboTax, QuickBooks and Credit Karma, announced earnings per share (EPS) of $3.32, which topped the consensus estimate among analysts of $2.58. Revenue in the quarter totaled $3.96 billion, which beat forecasts of $3.83 billion. Sales were up 17% from a year earlier.\n\nIn their earnings release, Intuit\u2019s management team talked up the company\u2019s growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into its software products, writing, \u201cWe are making great progress fueling the financial success of consumers, businesses, and accountants with our AI-driven expert platform.\u201d\n\nForward Guidance\n\nLooking ahead, Intuit said that it expects earnings in the current quarter of $10.89 to $10.95. That outlook is below the analyst consensus that called for $11.51 in EPS. Revenue is forecast at $7.55 billion to $7.60 billion. The sales guidance is ahead of Wall Street expectations of $7.35 billion.\n\nFor its entire Fiscal 2025 financial year, Intuit foresees earnings of $19.16 to $19.36, which is a little ahead of the $19.29 that analysts had anticipated. Full-year revenue is expected at $18.16 billion to $18.35 billion, the midpoint of which is near the analyst consensus of $18.28 billion.\n\nIf successfully achieved, the full-year guidance would translate into year-over-year growth of 14% in earnings and 12% in revenue. INTU stock has declined 16% over the past 12 months.\n\nIs INTU Stock a Buy?\n\nThe stock of Intuit has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 14 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 10 Buy, three Hold, and one Sell recommendations assigned in the last three months. The average INTU price target of $721.42 implies 30% upside from current levels. These ratings are likely to change after the company\u2019s latest financial results.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on INTU stock\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

Here\u2019s what to look for.\n\nIntuit beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 3.9% last quarter, reporting revenues of $3.28 billion, up 10.2% year on year. It was a satisfactory quarter for the company, with a solid beat of analysts\u2019 billings estimates.\n\nIs Intuit a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Intuit\u2019s revenue to grow 13% year on year to $3.83 billion, improving from the 11.3% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $2.58 per share.\n\nIntuit Total Revenue\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Intuit has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates four times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Intuit\u2019s peers in the finance and HR software segment, some have already reported their Q4 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. BlackLine delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 8.8%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 0.6%, and Paycor reported revenues up 13.1%, topping estimates by 1.9%. BlackLine traded down 18.1% following the results while Paycor\u2019s stock price was unchanged.\n\nRead our full analysis of BlackLine\u2019s results here and Paycor\u2019s results here.\n\nInflation has progressed towards the Fed\u2019s 2% goal as of late, leading to strong stock market performance. Recent rate cuts and the 2024 Presidential election's conclusion added further sparks to the market, and while some of the finance and HR software stocks have shown solid performance, the group has generally underpeformed, with share prices down 2.8% on average over the last month. Intuit is down 6.7% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $719.24 (compared to the current share price of $565.47).\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

While the post-earnings stock reaction will depend on how the results and outlook stack up against investor expectations, a detailed look at historical results can aid you if you are an event-driven trader. Here is how \u2013 either understand the historical odds and position yourself prior to the earnings announcement, or look at the correlation between immediate return and medium-term return post earnings and take a trade one-day after the announcement.\n\nIntuit\u2019s Historical Odds Of Positive Post-Earnings Return\n\nSome observations on one-day (1D) post earnings returns:\n\nIn the past 5 years, 22 earnings data points recorded, with 16 positive and 6 negative one-day (1D) returns observed. In summary, positive 1D returns seen about 73% of the times.\n\nand one-day (1D) returns observed. In summary, positive 1D returns seen about 73% of the times. However, this percentage has decreased to 67% if we consider last 3 year data instead of 5.\n\nMedian of the 16 positive returns = 2.9%, and median of the 6 negative returns =-1.8%\n\nAdditional data for observed returns 5-days (5D), and 30-days (30D) post earnings are summarized along with the statistics, in the table below.\n\nCorrelation Between 1D, 5D and 30D Historical Returns\n\nA relatively less risky strategy (though not useful if correlation is low) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair that has highest correlation and execute the appropriate trade. For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves \u201clong\u201d for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns.\n\nIs There Any Correlation With Peer Earnings?\n\nSometimes, peer performance can have influence on post-earnings stock-reaction. In fact, the pricing-in might begin before the earnings are announced. Here is some historical data on past post-earnings performance of Intuit stock compared with stock performance of peers that reported earnings just prior to Intuit. For fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings one day (1D) return.\n\nLearn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), to produce strong returns for investors.

            "content": "What To Expect From Intuit Q2 Earnings?\n\nWall Street analysts rerated Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) ahead of its quarterly earnings report amid an exciting earnings season. JP Morgan analyst Mark R Murphy remained Neutral rated on Intuit.\n\nHeading into Intuit\u2019s second quarter, Murphy\u2019s view of valuation risk/reward has improved, given the stock\u2019s pullback to a lower level than it traded at 3.5 years ago while appreciating moving pieces, particularly around TurboTax, which is typically the leading investor focus this time of year due to the approaching tax season.\n\nAlso Read: MongoDB Expands AI Capabilities With Voyage AI Deal, Targets Faster Insights From Unstructured Data\n\nThe analyst published early on potential impacts from the IRS deferral of the tax filing deadline from April to October for those affected by the California wildfires.\n\nHe noted that the tax relief initiative may create noise in the short term and defer revenue from the third quarter to later periods, albeit likely in a de-minimis amount.\n\nAn emergent concern is that DOGE-related initiatives to simplify the tax code or develop a tax filing app could negatively impact TurboTax.

The associated price target is $800.00.\n\nBrent Thill has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that suggest a positive outlook for Intuit in the second half of the fiscal year. Despite the stock\u2019s underperformance year-to-date, Thill anticipates a better entry point following the second quarter earnings. This optimism is driven by expectations of improved conditions in the small and medium-sized business (SMB) segment, particularly as the challenges posed by Mailchimp begin to ease and SMB sentiment improves.\n\nAdditionally, Thill notes the potential for strong performance in Intuit\u2019s consumer segment, especially with aggressive go-to-market strategies in the latter half of the year. The Credit Karma segment also shows promise, with strong growth in the first quarter and positive management commentary. Overall, Thill highlights Intuit\u2019s resilient tax and SMB segments, robust operating margins, and attractive valuation as key reasons for maintaining a Buy rating.\n\nIn another report released on February 21, Citi also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $760.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

That number jumped to 40% when they polled Gen Z and self-employed filers.\n\nTrending Now: 6 Reasons Your Tax Refund Will Be Higher in 2025\n\nLearn More: 8 Common Mistakes Retirees Make With Their Social Security Checks\n\nConsidering 105 million Americans (roughly two-thirds, according to NPFG.org) received a tax refund in 2024, and there were no major tax law changes this year that would shift these numbers significantly, there may be nothing to fear for taxpayers but filing itself.\n\nIn fact, 45% of Gen Zers said that filing taxes causes more stress than actually paying a tax bill, according to the Intuit Credit Karma survey. Courtney Alev, Credit Karma\u2019s head of tax and consumer financial advocate, said that\u2019s understandable. \u201cMany aspects of the filing process can be overwhelming,\u201d she said.\n\nHere are a few things for Gen Z to keep in mind to keep the filing process pain-free and avoid tears.\n\nDecide How You Want To File\n\nEven the act of choosing how to file can be daunting for young filers, Alev acknowledged. \u201cDo your research to understand what the best tax filing option is for you. Regardless of which option you go with, you should know there are free options available.\u201d\n\nAscent Funding CEO Ken Ruggiero added that anyone with an adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less can use the IRS Free File Guided Tax Software. \u201cA lot of Gen Z will fall into that category, so they don\u2019t have to pay a software provider for something they can get for free,\u201d he said.\n\nDiscover More: Here\u2019s How Much Your State Collects on Every Type of Tax\n\nGather the Right Paperwork\n\nWhether you use the IRS Free File option, tax software or hire a professional, you\u2019ll want to gather all the information you need in advance. If you\u2019ve only worked one job, this might be easy. But, Ruggiero said, \u201cmembers of the Gen Z population often have a set of jobs or side gigs, so they\u2019ve got multiple W-2s or 1099 forms. Keep track of that paperwork, because it makes life easier.\u201d\n\nAlev added, \u201cFiling taxes is way easier when you\u2019re not scrambling for missing documents.\u201d\n\nRealize that some employers or clients send W-2s or 1099s electronically. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know what email you used when you signed up,\u201d Ruggiero said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t receive your W-9 or 1099 by February, you should reach out and ask the employer when you will be receiving your documentation.\u201d\n\nEnsure All Income Is Accounted for and Start Planning if You\u2019ll Owe Money\n\nTracking paperwork and income, and ensuring you have enough money to pay taxes, gets even trickier for Gen Z members who embraced the gig economy, Alev added.",

Credit: IMAGO / ZUMA Press Wire\n\nFloyd \u2018Money\u2019 Mayweather, known for raking in hundreds of millions during his undefeated boxing career, has turned his focus to real estate. Having made a fortune in it, he\u2019s not keeping his success a secret.\n\nThe retired boxing legend has revealed that he owns a $402 million real estate portfolio spanning 60+ properties in New York, one of the most competitive real estate markets in the world. Mayweather is encouraging fans to get in the game too, citing how lucrative it is.\n\nAccording to Mayweather, investing in real estate is one of the smartest ways to build generational wealth. The boxer believes that if he can do it, so can anyone willing to put in the work. Floyd\u2019s deal, which included over 1,000 affordable housing units in Upper Manhattan, was one of the biggest real estate transactions in NYC last year.\n\nIt marked a full circle moment for Mayweather, who grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan, sharing a cramped one-bedroom apartment with seven family members. He took to Instagram to provide an insight into the acquisitions in his real estate portfolio.\n\n\u201cWell, lately I purchased 62 apartment buildings in New York City. Guess what, all the buildings belong to me, I don\u2019t have no partners. All the retails down below on my buildings, all of them belong to me too. Guess what, you can do the same, it\u2019s all about making power moves,\u201d he said.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Floyd Mayweather (@floydmayweather)\n\nThe undefeated champion\u2019s business portfolio expansion does not seem to end with real estate either. Mayweather wants to own a piece of the New York Giants.\n\n\u2018Money\u2019 is leading a group looking to buy a 10% stake in the four-time Super Bowl champions. And, if reports are anything to go by, the deal is shaping up to be huge.\n\nFloyd\u2019s power move with the Giants\n\nAccording to TMZ Sports, Mayweather and real estate mogul Meyer Orbach are putting together a massive offer to the Giants, with another big-money investor possibly joining the team soon.\n\nThe expected price tag? Around $700 million. In fact, Mayweather has already moved $200 million into an escrow account, showing just how serious he is.\n\nI\u2019m always making moves to add to my portfolio: https://t.co/2CuLp5Mot8 \u2014 Floyd Mayweather (@FloydMayweather) February 18, 2025\n\n\n\nWhile Orbach refused to comment on it any further, it should be noted that he knows a thing or two about the game, having already owned nearly 20% of the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThe Giants, one of the most historic franchises in the NFL, are currently valued at $7.5 billion, according to Forbes. With John Mara and Steve Tisch looking to sell part of their stake, the timing of Floyd\u2019s entry couldn\u2019t be better.\n\nAre other NFL team owners supporting Mayweather? Sources say he\u2019s already received letters of support from two. So this could really happen. Now that\u2019s a real power move by \u2018Money\u2019.",

Clippers' spiffy new home in Inglewood has the bells and whistles befitting a $2 billion venue \u2014 from boasting five basketball courts to the most leg room of any arena in the NBA to a promise of a frictionless experience at the parking lots and concessions.\n\nBut the Intuit Dome promises to offer something no other venue in the state allows \u2014 the ability to serve alcohol in VIP suites until 4 a.m., thanks to a bill that Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk has signed into law.\n\nAB 3206 would \"authorize alcoholic beverage sales to occur between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. upon the on-sale licensed premises operated in a fully enclosed arena with a seating capacity of at least 18,000 seats located in the City of Inglewood if specified conditions are met,\" according to the bill's language, which matches the description of the Intuit Dome.\n\n\"Instead of authorizing an entire city or jurisdiction to allow after our alcohol sales, we're taking a venue-by-venue approach,\" said Terry Schanz, chief of staff to Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, who authored the bill.\n\nA handful of legislative efforts have failed to expand last call in the state, including one in 2022 to allow cities like West Hollywood to serve alcohol past 2 a.m.\n\nSchanz said those failed attempts have prompted the \"new approach\" in this proposal.\n\n\n\nConcerns are raised\n\nThe exclusivity of this exception had raised concerns.\n\n\"If you have an institution that's open that late, that means added burden, for example, on law enforcement or other local businesses, whether they be gas stations or otherwise,\" said Laurie Levenson, a professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School and a former federal prosecutor.\n\n\"I can see that this was probably done to boost the new stadium,\" Levenson added. But, \"the benefits have to be to the whole community, not just to particular individuals, or that really will bring on scrutiny.\"\n\n\"Questions like, why are they making this exception? Do they really need to make this exception? What is the problem you're trying to solve with this bill? And what are the problems you might be causing with this bill?\" Levenson said.\n\n\n\nBuilt-in guardrails\n\nSchanz said the bill includes a number of measures \u2014 like including a sunset on the bill for future legislative review, a limit on the size of the area to 2,500 square feet where last-call would be extended, and and a cap on the number of patrons to 100 people.\n\n\"A lot of these guardrails are intended to make sure that we are protecting the public health and safety \u2014 not just of the patrons of the venue, but also of the surrounding community,\" Schanz said.\n\nIn addition, he said the Inglewood City Council will need to approve the provision every year until 2030, its built-in sunset date.\n\n\"I don't see that as causing any kind of public safety or public policy concerns,\" Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts said. \"The reality is you're inside of an arena that has its own security in a private club area, with patrons that can afford to pay for very expensive suites. This is not an area of general public congregation.\"\n\nButts added that the 4 a.m. cutoff would only happen on event and game nights, which he calculated to be about 70 days out of the year.\n\n\"AB 3206 complements the over $2 billion of private investment that has been made through the construction of the recently opened Intuit Dome, it's another signal of Inglewood's renaissance that's underway,\" Schanz said.\n\n",

Price and EPS Surprise\n\nIntuit Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nIntuit Inc. price-eps-surprise | Intuit Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nIntuit faces mixed dynamics heading into its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings, suggesting investors may want to hold current positions or wait for a more attractive entry point. While the company's fundamentals remain solid, several factors could put pressure on results.\n\n\n\nIn its second-quarter guidance, Intuit projected revenue growth of 13-14% but notably warned of an expected single-digit decline in Consumer Group revenues due to promotional changes in retail channels related to its desktop offering. Though management emphasized that this only impacts revenue timing rather than full-year expectations, it might have weighed on second-quarter performance.\n\n\n\nThe company's Online Ecosystem revenue growth showed strength, accelerating to 20% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 18% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. This momentum in the core QuickBooks franchise was driven by customer growth, higher effective prices, and continued mix-shift toward higher-end offerings. The mid-market expansion through QuickBooks Advanced and Enterprise Suite also demonstrated robust 42% growth.\n\n\n\nCredit Karma's 29% revenue growth in the first quarter marked strong execution across personal loans, auto insurance, and credit card verticals. However, it remains to be seen if the growth rate has been sustained this time around, given the macroeconomic environment and lending conditions.\n\n\n\nMailchimp has been facing some headwinds from higher churn among smaller customers, though management has addressed this through product enhancements. The company noted it could take a few quarters to show improved outcomes at scale, potentially impacting near-term growth.\n\n\n\nWhile Intuit's long-term story remains compelling with its AI-driven platform strategy and massive $300B+ TAM opportunity, the current valuation appears to price in much of the optimism. The stock trades at a premium multiple, reflecting strong execution but leaving limited room for disappointment.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the company's Desktop Ecosystem transition and promotional changes create some uncertainty around the second-quarter results despite management's confidence in full-year targets. Given these factors, investors may benefit from a wait-and-see approach before earnings while maintaining existing positions in this quality franchise.",

Intuit also provides an AI-driven cash flow outlook and recommendations, such as sending invoice reminders on overdue invoices, adding late fees to customers who take a long time to pay, and tapping into a line of credit for which they are pre-approved.\n\nNow, we\u2019re taking cash flow management to the next level with agentic AI \u201cdone-for-you\u201d experiences in production on Intuit\u2019s platform. Agentic AI workflows are now doing the hard work on behalf of customers by dynamically processing accounts receivable and accounts payable invoices with Intuit QuickBooks Online. This is complemented by personalized AI-driven insights and recommendations, and a seamless path to AI-powered human tax and bookkeeping experts whenever needed.\n\nIntuit\u2019s specialized AI workflows process relevant business artifacts, such as user-submitted images of hand-written notes from client meetings, documents, and emails, and then orchestrating any necessary accounts receivable and accounts payable-specific follow up actions like creating invoices, bills and invoice reminders for review. Agentic AI workflows complete portions of the customer\u2019s workflow with precision and efficiency, while preserving customer control for decision-making.\n\nFor example, when an invoice reminder is created for customer review, they\u2019ll see a simple display with highlighted excerpts\u2014from relevant documents and key insights from past history\u2014to understand why the agent selected the particular voice and tone for the reminder message. Making it easy for them to approve the reminder before it\u2019s sent on their behalf.\n\nThis agentic AI capability is generally available to QuickBooks Online customers where users are getting paid an average of 5 days faster when they send invoice reminders with Intuit Assist. Overdue invoices are 10% more likely to be paid in full, as it detects past due invoices and automatically drafts personalized invoice reminders. These personalized messages are generated based on the client history and invoice status, to ensure the reminder has the right tone based on each situation, allowing the business owner to simply review, send, and get paid.\n\nBy automating routine administrative tasks on Intuit\u2019s platform business owners can redirect their time and energy to what truly matters: growing their business and driving long-term success.\n\nIntuit QuickBooks customer Kim Cross, owner of Zhi Bath & Body says it best: \u201cI got into business because I wanted to help people with sensitive skin get access to the products that would help them love their skin naturally,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I found that I was spending the majority of my time doing manual, administrative tasks that didn\u2019t allow me to do what I got in business to do: help people, develop new products, and find new ways to grow.\u201d\n\nFor more than a decade, Intuit\u2019s robust data and AI capabilities have been foundational to the company\u2019s success as a fintech industry leader and technology innovator. Intuit\u2019s agentic AI experiences are powered by our proprietary generative AI operating system, GenOS.",

            "content": "Intuit (INTU \u2013 Research Report), the Technology sector company, was revisited by a Wall Street analyst today. Analyst Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo maintained a Buy rating on the stock and has a $775.00 price target.\n\nMichael Turrin has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors impacting Intuit\u2019s stock. Firstly, the company\u2019s valuation is currently below historical norms, presenting a potential for significant upside. This is evident as the shares are trading at lower multiples compared to Intuit\u2019s historical averages. Additionally, Intuit\u2019s pricing power remains strong, especially with their TurboTax offering, where a majority of users have indicated comfort with price increases.\n\nFurthermore, the company\u2019s QuickBooks product continues to demonstrate robust growth, which is crucial given its importance to Intuit\u2019s portfolio. There is also optimism around the potential for improving SMB sentiment to support this growth. Lastly, while tax-related headwinds present near-term challenges, there is a belief that these factors will eventually turn favorable, further justifying the Buy rating. Overall, the combination of these elements underpins the positive outlook for Intuit\u2019s stock performance.\n\nBased on the recent corporate insider activity of 107 insiders, corporate insider sentiment is negative on the stock. This means that over the past quarter there has been an increase of insiders selling their shares of INTU in relation to earlier this year.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

A survey published by Intuit Credit Karma found that most people in those cohorts have consulted creators on TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram for help with their finances, but some of them have since vowed to never trust #FinTok again.\n\nQualtrics conducted the study on behalf of Intuit Credit Karma by surveying 1,510 respondents over the age of 18. Though less than half of Americans seek financial advice through social media, 77% of Gen Z and 61% of Millennials are searching online to make sense of their dollars.\n\nAs demonstrated through previous studies, #FinTok is not the top source for financial creator content. YouTube remains #1 in that ranking, attracting 71% of Gen Z respondents. Instagram (50%) and TikTok (49%) are the next-most frequented destinations.\n\nSubscribe for daily Tubefilter Top Stories Subscribe\n\nBut #FinTok has come to represent a rising group of creators who have gained favor with Gen Z and Millennials by providing common sense financial advice for free. That community has been a dose of fresh air for young people who are concerned about topics like budgeting, taxes, and investing, but it contains a darker side as well. Poor advice and shills for scams are all too common on #FinTok, and Intuit Credit Karma\u2019s survey shows that some viewers are fed up.\n\n39% of Gen Z and 33% of Millennials reported that bad outcomes convinced them to swear off social media financial advice for good. In many cases, that decision was motivated by an IRS audit. 37% of Gen Z and 25% of Millennials said they have gotten into some form of trouble after taking advice from a financial creator.\n\nTikTok has urged its users to #BeCyberSmart by scanning for bad advice as they watch #FinTok content, but it\u2019s not always easy to suss out crypto scams and risky investments. For most of Intuit Credit Karma\u2019s Gen Z and Millennial respondents, financial social content is a nice asset, but it\u2019s not valued as highly as the most trusted sources for money help: Family and friends.",

            "content": "Valued at a market cap of $164.4 billion, Intuit Inc. (INTU) is a financial software company that develops and sells financial, accounting, and tax preparation software and related services for small businesses, consumers, and accounting professionals. The Mountain View, California-based company\u2019s offerings include QuickBooks financial and business-management online services, payroll solutions, merchant payment-processing solutions, and financing for small businesses.\n\nShares of this financial software giant have significantly lagged behind the broader market over the past 52 weeks. Intuit has declined 11.6% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has soared 22.5%. Moreover, on a YTD basis, the stock is down 7.7%, compared to SPX\u2019s 4.2% rise.\n\nNarrowing the focus, Intuit\u2019s underperformance looks even more pronounced when compared to the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLK) 19.5% return over the past 52 weeks and nearly 4.2% gain on a YTD basis.\n\nIntuit released its Q1 earnings results on Nov. 21, and INTU's shares fell 5.7% the following day despite delivering notably better-than-expected Q1 adjusted earnings of $2.50 per share and revenues of $3.3 billion. Moreover, the bottom line advanced 1.2% from the year-ago quarter, while the top line improved 10.1% year-over-year.\n\nHowever, what disappointed investors the most was INTU\u2019s Q2 forecast, which came below analysts\u2019 expectations. Moreover, a massive 17% decline in its Desktop Ecosystem revenues, stemming from strategic changes to desktop offerings implemented in early fiscal 2024, somewhat affected its otherwise strong performance and might have further dampened investor confidence.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in July, analysts expect Intuit\u2019s EPS to grow 21.4% year over year to $14.09. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is promising. It surpassed the Wall Street estimates in each of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 28 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d which is based on 21 \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d one \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d five \u201cHold,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell\u201d rating.\n\nOn Nov. 23, Morgan Stanley maintained an \u201cEqual-Weight\u201d rating on Intuit and raised its price target to $730, which indicates a 25.9% potential upside from the current levels.\n\nThe mean price target of $734.62 represents a 26.7% upside from Intuit\u2019s current price levels, while the Street-high price target of $800 suggests an upside potential of 37.9%.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss has maintained their neutral stance on INTU stock, giving a Hold rating yesterday.\n\nKeith Weiss has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors influencing Intuit\u2019s current outlook. One of the primary concerns is the uncertainty surrounding TurboTax\u2019s performance, as the investor debate on the company\u2019s fiscal year 2025 Consumer revenue guidance remains unresolved. With the tax season still in its early stages, there is little clarity on whether Intuit\u2019s growth strategies, particularly for TurboTax, will meet expectations. Additionally, Intuit faces potential risks from new LLM-driven help options potentially cannibalizing TurboTax Live, and uncertainty around the success of the Full Assist offering.\n\nAnother contributing factor is the competitive pressure from H&R Block, which might hinder TurboTax\u2019s unit growth despite Intuit\u2019s pricing strategies. H&R Block\u2019s offerings, such as the AI Tax Assist tool and transparent pricing, are positioned to challenge TurboTax. Moreover, the potential simplification of the U.S. tax code under the new government could impose pricing pressures on Intuit\u2019s higher-priced offerings, adding to the uncertainty. Given these challenges, coupled with already high expectations for Small Business growth, Intuit\u2019s shares lack a strong near-term catalyst for upward movement, supporting the Hold rating.\n\nWeiss covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as Salesforce, Adobe, and Intuit. According to TipRanks, Weiss has an average return of 16.2% and a 66.38% success rate on recommended stocks.\n\nIn another report released yesterday, Redburn Atlantic also initiated coverage with a Hold rating on the stock with a $560.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Intuit Inc. ( ) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is Intuit's Debt?\n\nAs you can see below, at the end of October 2024, Intuit had US$6.12b of debt, up from US$5.88b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it also had US$3.36b in cash, and so its net debt is US$2.77b.\n\nA Look At Intuit's Liabilities\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Intuit had liabilities of US$8.62b due within a year, and liabilities of US$6.44b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$3.36b in cash and US$1.35b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$10.4b.\n\nSince publicly traded Intuit shares are worth a very impressive total of US$164.4b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\n\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.\n\nIntuit has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.62. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 46.7 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. Also good is that Intuit grew its EBIT at 13% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Intuit can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the last three years, Intuit actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces.\n\nOur View\n\nThe good news is that Intuit's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Overall, we don't think Intuit is taking any bad risks, as its debt load seems modest. So the balance sheet looks pretty healthy, to us. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified that you should be aware of.\n\nOf course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover , today.\n\nNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts Our new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities. \u2022 Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n\n\u2022 Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n\n\u2022 High growth Tech and AI Companies\n\n\n\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.

While she keeps a low public profile, Anjali has played a crucial role in her husband's journey to success.\n\nAge: 54 (born January 11, 1971)\n\n54 (born January 11, 1971) Business/Profession: Business Operations Manager at Intuit (formerly Business Analyst at Accenture)\n\nBusiness Operations Manager at Intuit (formerly Business Analyst at Accenture) Height: Approximately 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm)\n\nApproximately 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm) Spouse: Sundar Pichai (CEO of Google & Alphabet)\n\nSundar Pichai (CEO of Google & Alphabet) Net Worth: Estimated to be several million dollars (exact figure undisclosed)\n\nEstimated to be several million dollars (exact figure undisclosed) Education: Chemical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur\n\nChemical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur Nationality: Indian-American\n\nIndian-American Children: Two (son and daughter)\n\nTwo (son and daughter) Residence: Los Altos Hills, California, USA\n\nRelated: Inside the Daily Routine of Google CEO Sundar Pichai: How He Starts His Day and Stays Productive\n\nAnjali Pichai\u2019s Career\n\nAnjali Pichai is a business operations manager at Intuit, a financial software company. Before that, she worked as a business analyst at Accenture from 1999 to 2002. Anjali studied chemical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, the same university where she met Sundar.\n\nUnlike her husband, who ventured into the world of software and internet technologies, Anjali\u2019s career has been more focused on business strategy and operational leadership. Her expertise in analytics and business growth has made her a key figure in her field.\n\nDoes Anjali Pichai Own Google Shares?\n\nThere is no public record of Anjali Pichai directly holding shares in Google (Alphabet Inc.). However, as Sundar Pichai\u2019s spouse, she undoubtedly benefits from his lucrative stock options and compensation packages. Sundar\u2019s net worth is estimated to be around $1.3 billion, with a significant portion coming from Google stock and performance-based incentives.\n\nAnjali Pichai\u2019s Net Worth\n\nWhile Anjali\u2019s exact net worth isn\u2019t publicly disclosed, her career at Accenture and Intuit, along with her connection to Sundar Pichai, suggests she has accumulated significant wealth. Estimates place her individual net worth at several million dollars, though it pales in comparison to Sundar\u2019s billion-dollar fortune.\n\nRelated: Inside Tim Cook\u2019s Daily Routine: How the Apple CEO Stays on Top\n\nRelated: Sundar Pichai\u2019s Vision for Google in 2025\n\nAnjali & Sundar Pichai\u2019s Love Story\n\nAnjali and Sundar met while studying engineering at IIT Kharagpur. Their relationship started as a college romance and blossomed into a strong partnership that has lasted through Sundar\u2019s rise to the top of Silicon Valley.\n\nDespite his high-profile career, Sundar has credited Anjali with being a steadying force in his life. In fact, he once revealed that during their college days, he had to wait months to speak with Anjali because she didn\u2019t have a phone in her hostel.\n\nRelated: The Bad Habits Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Mark Cuban Had to Ditch to Succeed\n\nRelated: Mark Zuckerberg: A Glimpse into the Daily Life of Meta's Visionary Leader\n\nA Private Life Away from the Spotlight\n\nUnlike many high-profile tech executives and their families, Anjali prefers to keep a low-key lifestyle. She rarely makes public appearances and avoids social media. The Pichais live in Los Altos Hills, California, in a luxurious yet understated home, prioritizing privacy and family life.\n\nAnjali Pichai may not be a household name, but her career in business operations, background in engineering, and unwavering support for Sundar Pichai make her an influential figure in the tech world. While she doesn\u2019t own Google shares (at least publicly), her role in Sundar\u2019s journey has undoubtedly been instrumental in shaping the success of one of the most powerful CEOs in the world.",

            "content": "The 2024-25 NBA regular season is back on the menu now that this year's All-Star activities are over.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers' sole focus going forward is making the playoffs, which seems like a real possibility given that they're currently fifth in the Western Conference with a 32-20 record. It'll be paramount for every player to do their part in helping build momentum down the stretch, meaning everyone \u2014 from Luka Doncic and LeBron James to the role players \u2014 must live up to their potential.\n\nAlthough Lakers fans don't have to worry about some players stepping up, that isn't the case for one veteran who's been robbing the team blind all season long.\n\nGabe Vincent's Performance Has Robbed the Lakers Blind\n\nAlthough several Lakers' 2024-25 performances haven't matched their price tag, there's no question that Gabe Vincent has been one of the biggest thieves on the team.\n\nVincent made his way to Los Angeles on a three-year, $33 million contract ahead of the 2023-24 campaign. The former 2018 undrafted free agent was just coming off a respectable performance that saw him average 9.4 points, 2.5 assists, and 0.9 steals across 68 appearances with the Miami Heat in 2022-23.\n\nInjuries limited the former UC Santa Barbara product to 11 appearances in Year 1 with the Lakers, leaving the fanbase hoping for better results this season. Unfortunately, and as many L.A. fans know, that hasn't been the case.\n\nIn 44 games (6 starts) in 2024-25, Vicent is only averaging 5.7 points, 1.5 assists, and 1.2 rebounds while shooting 40.9% from the floor and 35.0% from deep. Although those numbers are an improvement over last year's averages, it's hardly the type of production the Lakers wanted from a player who's being paid $11 million this season \u2014 especially when he's only gotten slower with each passing year.\n\nVincent's play had improved before the All-Star stoppage, averaging 9.4 points and 2.9 assists with .477/.394/.500 shooting splits in his last 11 appearances. As solid as his recently improved play has been, though, it still isn't worth the money he's stealing from the Lakers.\n\nUnless he completely blows head coach JJ Redick and general manager Rob Pelinka away down the stretch and in the playoffs, Vincent is a likely offseason trade candidate. The Lakers will look to make as many improvements as possible around Doncic and James, and the 28-year-old PG's $11.5 million salary could be an important asset to help land another star.\n\nNBA teams can start trading once their season ends, meaning there are a few more months before Vincent learns his fate. In the meantime, the veteran PG can help the Lakers capitalize on the fact that they currently hold the sixth-best 2025 NBA Finals odds (+1800) on DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\nMore Los Angeles Lakers News & Rumors:\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.",

Clippers' spiffy new home in Inglewood has the bells and whistles befitting a $2 billion venue \u2014 from boasting five basketball courts to the most leg room of any arena in the NBA to a promise of a frictionless experience at the parking lots and concessions.\n\nBut the Intuit Dome promises to offer something no other venue in the state allows \u2014 the ability to serve alcohol in VIP suites until 4 a.m., thanks to a bill that Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk has signed into law.\n\nAB 3206 would \"authorize alcoholic beverage sales to occur between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. upon the on-sale licensed premises operated in a fully enclosed arena with a seating capacity of at least 18,000 seats located in the City of Inglewood if specified conditions are met,\" according to the bill's language, which matches the description of the Intuit Dome.\n\n\"Instead of authorizing an entire city or jurisdiction to allow after our alcohol sales, we're taking a venue-by-venue approach,\" said Terry Schanz, chief of staff to Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, who authored the bill.\n\nA handful of legislative efforts have failed to expand last call in the state, including one in 2022 to allow cities like West Hollywood to serve alcohol past 2 a.m.\n\nSchanz said those failed attempts have prompted the \"new approach\" in this proposal.\n\n\n\nConcerns are raised\n\nThe exclusivity of this exception had raised concerns.\n\n\"If you have an institution that's open that late, that means added burden, for example, on law enforcement or other local businesses, whether they be gas stations or otherwise,\" said Laurie Levenson, a professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School and a former federal prosecutor.\n\n\"I can see that this was probably done to boost the new stadium,\" Levenson added. But, \"the benefits have to be to the whole community, not just to particular individuals, or that really will bring on scrutiny.\"\n\n\"Questions like, why are they making this exception? Do they really need to make this exception? What is the problem you're trying to solve with this bill? And what are the problems you might be causing with this bill?\" Levenson said.\n\n\n\nBuilt-in guardrails\n\nSchanz said the bill includes a number of measures \u2014 like including a sunset on the bill for future legislative review, a limit on the size of the area to 2,500 square feet where last-call would be extended, and and a cap on the number of patrons to 100 people.\n\n\"A lot of these guardrails are intended to make sure that we are protecting the public health and safety \u2014 not just of the patrons of the venue, but also of the surrounding community,\" Schanz said.\n\nIn addition, he said the Inglewood City Council will need to approve the provision every year until 2030, its built-in sunset date.\n\n\"I don't see that as causing any kind of public safety or public policy concerns,\" Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts said. \"The reality is you're inside of an arena that has its own security in a private club area, with patrons that can afford to pay for very expensive suites. This is not an area of general public congregation.\"\n\nButts added that the 4 a.m. cutoff would only happen on event and game nights, which he calculated to be about 70 days out of the year.\n\n\"AB 3206 complements the over $2 billion of private investment that has been made through the construction of the recently opened Intuit Dome, it's another signal of Inglewood's renaissance that's underway,\" Schanz said.\n\n",

Fans have the option of securing a $500 deposit and will be able to purchase their package before the general public.\n\nThe second option is to join a waitlist and an NBA Experiences representative will notify fans once packages go on sale.\n\nThe NBA Experience Package includes:\n\nA Ticket for Saturday night\u2019s events\n\nA game ticket to the 75th NBA All-Star Game\n\nNBA Exp Lounge\n\nNBA Legend Meet & Greets\n\nTickets for individual events are expected to be released at a later date.\n\nClick here for more information.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"Clipper Nation, we ready. Intuit Dome\u2014it\u2019s gonna be live in there. I\u2019m excited for the world to get an opportunity to see how beautiful that establishment is,\" said 11-time NBA All-Star, James Harden, in a press release. \"We\u2019re a year out\u2014we\u2019re ready now\u2014but we\u2019ve got a year to prepare, and make sure it\u2019s flawless for everybody to see.\"\n\n\"We want this to be the penultimate basketball experience,\" Clippers owner Steve Ballmer said when the event was announced last year.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Los Angeles to host 2026 NBA All-Star weekend at Clippers' new arena in Inglewood\n\nWhy you should care:\n\nNBA All-Star Weekend 2026 is just one of the many sporting events that will allow Los Angeles to showcase itself as a host city ahead of the 2028 Olympics.\n\nSUGGESTED COVERAGE:\n\nThe mid-season showcase reaches fans in more than 200 countries and territories in more than 50 languages.\n\nThe other side:\n\nThe NBA All-Star Game has been heavily criticized in recent years as it fights for relevancy.\n\nWith a new format and Kevin Hart taking on a hosting role, the 2025 event in San Francisco was no exception.\n\n\"By the end of the night, the basketball was an afterthought, with an uncompetitive championship final secondary in the minds of viewers to everything that was going wrong on their TVs,\" wrote Jason Owens with Yahoo! Sports.\n\n\"I think maybe we should focus on some other things than All-Star,\" Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic said, as reported by ESPN. \"I think it's always going to be like this so we should accept it.\"\n\nDig deeper:\n\nNext season marks the seventh time NBA All-Star Weekend will be hosted in Los Angeles. It was last held in the LA area in 2018, and the City of Angels has also hosted the event in 2011, 2004, 1983, 1972 and 1963.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting every All-Star MVP during the LA games was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. Those elite players were:\n\nLeBron James (2018)\n\nKobe Bryant (2011)\n\nShaquille O\u2019Neal (2004)\n\nJulius Erving (1983)\n\nJerry West (1972)\n\nBill Russell (1963)\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nNBA All-Star Weekend is expected to have a massive impact on LA's economy. While numbers from last weekend aren't available, the 2024 event in Indianapolis generated over $403 million, the NBA confirmed.",

Similar to their first bout, Fiziev started strong, surprising with two early takedowns and sharp striking, but Gaethje took control in the second round, dropping him with a powerful uppercut.\n\nWith the fight likely tied, Fiziev opened the third with aggressive kicks, but Gaethje\u2019s steady pressure and heavy shots sealed the victory. Now 2-0 against Fiziev, Gaethje reaffirms his place in the lightweight Top 5 and the former BMF champion remains one of the division\u2019s most dangerous contenders.\n\nPerformance Of The Night Bonuses\n\nPerformance Of The Night: Mauricio Ruffy\n\nMauricio Ruffy wasted no time making a statement at UFC 313, delivering a highlight reel knockout that will be replayed for years to come. Facing the seasoned King Green in his 50th professional fight, Ruffy landed a crisp right hand that caught Green\u2019s attention, leading to a perfectly timed spinning wheel kick that shut the lightweights lights out at 2:07 of Round 1.\n\nWith one of the best knockouts we\u2019ve seen so far, Ruffy improved to 3-0 in the UFC and continues his rapid rise up the 155 pound ladder. This performance not only solidified his place as a serious contender but also added to the growing legacy of the Fighting Nerds camp. If there were any doubts about Ruffy\u2019s potential, he silenced them with one spectacular kick tonight.\n\nPerformance Of The Night: Ignacio Bahamondes\n\nIgnacio Bahamondes scored the biggest win of his UFC career at UFC 313, submitting Jalin Turner with a slick triangle choke at 2:29 of Round 1. Known for his striking, Bahamondes showed off his ground skills after being taken down, staying active from the bottom before locking in the fight-ending submission.\n\nThe victory marks his third straight finish and sixth win in seven fights, solidifying his case for a spot in the lightweight Top 15. With his evolving skill set and rising momentum, Bahamondes is quickly becoming a serious contender in the division.\n\nAttendance: 18,869 (sold out)\n\nGate: $10.1 million",

            "content": "In an era where sensitive data is a prime target for cyberattacks and compliance violations, effective data classification is the critical first step in safeguarding information. Recognizing the importance of this process, Intuit hosted their first highly competitive Data Classification Challenge, bringing together 20 leading vendors from the U.S. and Israel to showcase their AI-powered solutions. The result? BigID emerged as the clear winner, setting a new benchmark for accuracy, speed, and precision.\n\nData breaches are becoming more sophisticated, often targeting organizations that fail to properly classify and protect sensitive information. Without robust data classification, organizations risk exposing confidential data to breaches and compliance penalties. Accurate classification empowers businesses to manage their data securely, ensuring privacy, regulatory adherence, and operational efficiency.\n\nThe Challenge and BigID\u2019s Win\n\nIntuit\u2019s challenge was designed to push the limits of data classification technology. Participants were given a synthetic dataset containing over 40,000 records, split evenly for training and evaluation. Vendors were judged on their ability to rapidly and accurately classify diverse data types, with scores based on precision, recall, and cross-label assessments.\n\nBigID distinguished itself with a weighted precision/recall score of 96.5%, surpassing every other competitor in the DSPM and DSP space. Its patented AI-driven technology delivered near-perfect results, demonstrating its ability to identify, classify, and manage sensitive data at scale.\n\nHow Data Classification is Instrumental in Reducing the Attack Surface\n\nIn the battle against cyber threats, data classification serves as a foundational defense mechanism by reducing the attack surface \u2014 the total sum of vulnerabilities through which attackers can gain unauthorized access to an organization\u2019s systems and data. Without a clear understanding of what sensitive information exists and where it resides, enterprises are essentially flying blind, leaving critical data exposed to exploitation.\n\nThe Link Between Classification and Risk Mitigation\n\nBy accurately identifying and categorizing sensitive data, organizations can prioritize protective measures for the most critical assets. This process ensures that security resources are allocated efficiently, reducing the likelihood of costly breaches. For example:\n\nPhishing and Email Attacks: When sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers or financial records, is absent from email communications thanks to proper classification, phishing attempts become far less damaging. Attackers may still breach an email system, but the lack of sensitive data significantly minimizes the impact.\n\nWhen sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers or financial records, is absent from email communications thanks to proper classification, phishing attempts become far less damaging. Attackers may still breach an email system, but the lack of sensitive data significantly minimizes the impact. Access Controls: Data classification informs role-based access policies, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. This minimizes insider threats and limits external attackers\u2019 ability to escalate privileges if they breach a system.\n\nData classification informs role-based access policies, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. This minimizes insider threats and limits external attackers\u2019 ability to escalate privileges if they breach a system. Cloud and Storage Management: Misconfigured cloud storage is a common attack vector. By classifying data in the cloud, organizations can apply appropriate controls to reduce vulnerabilities.\n\nProactive Defense Through Data Visibility and Control\n\nA comprehensive data classification strategy enables proactive defense by giving organizations visibility into their data landscape. This visibility allows for:\n\nTailored Security Policies: Classification informs policies around encryption, retention, and deletion, ensuring sensitive data is protected at every stage of its lifecycle. Compliance Alignment: Regulatory frameworks like GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA mandate the protection of certain data types, and the evolving AI regulatory landscape is no exception. Classification simplifies compliance efforts, reducing the risk of penalties and reputational damage. Incident Response Preparedness: In the event of a breach, knowing where sensitive data is stored and how it\u2019s protected allows organizations to respond faster and limit exposure.\n\nReducing the attack surface is not just about stopping breaches but also about limiting their scope and impact when they do occur. As cybercriminals evolve their tactics, robust data classification acts as a force multiplier for other security measures, from advanced threat detection to zero-trust architectures.\n\nBigID\u2019s AI-driven classification solutions exemplify this proactive approach. By delivering unmatched accuracy, speed, and scalability, BigID helps organizations identify and secure their most critical data, ensuring that even sophisticated attacks find fewer opportunities for exploitation. In doing so, enterprises not only mitigate risk but also strengthen their overall security posture.\n\nAutomation and AI: the Future of Security Posture and Risk Management\n\nBigID\u2019s multi-layered approach to data classification leverages cutting-edge technology to meet the growing demands of security, compliance, and AI-driven data management. As a pioneer in Data Security Posture Management (DSPM), BigID enables organizations to address evolving challenges with confidence. Its innovative solutions empower businesses to protect their most sensitive assets while maintaining compliance with ever-changing regulations.\n\n\u201cData protection is paramount to Intuit,\u201d said Gleb Keselman, Director of Security Software Engineering at Intuit. \u201cAs a global fintech serving over 100 million customers, we manage vast amounts of unique financial data. BigID\u2019s technology demonstrated impressive capabilities in accurately classifying data at scale, as reflected in their outstanding results in our challenge.\u201d\n\nIndustry Recognition and Future Vision\n\nBigID\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Dimitri Sirota, highlighted the significance of this achievement: \u201cWe are incredibly proud to be recognized by Intuit as the winner of their Data Classification Challenge. This achievement showcases our leadership in AI innovation and our commitment to delivering next-generation solutions for data security and management.\u201d\n\nAs organizations face mounting pressure to secure data and comply with regulations, BigID\u2019s technology offers a transformative solution. By redefining what\u2019s possible in data-centric security \u2013 from classification to DSPM to cloud DLP and AI governance \u2013 the company continues to lead the way in AI-powered innovation, ensuring businesses stay one step ahead of modern threats.\n\nThrough its victory in Intuit\u2019s challenge, BigID has reaffirmed its status as the gold standard for data security and classification, offering a powerful combination of precision, speed, and scale that is unmatched in the industry.\n\nSee the difference in data security with BigID.",

The festive has been unrolled with numerous celebrities and players arriving at the Chase Center. Well, one of them is the Bay Area\u2019s very own veteran star, Draymond Green. However, it did not take long for him to catch a stray after NBA\u2019s president, Adam Silver, issued a stern warning. But there\u2019s one more on the list who has a message for Green.\n\nGreen was entering the arena when he came face to face with a young kid. All cool, until? The Kid shot a video with Uncle Dray, \u201cYou know we here with Draymond Green. What\u2019s Good? What\u2019s Good?\u201d The Kid said. But wait, it is not over yet. The Warriors superstar gave the kid a friendly push and said, \u201cDon\u2019t call me Draymond Green like you don\u2019t know me.\u201d As he headed to talk to someone else standing in the background. All friendly? The story is yet to unfold.\n\nIt was then the kid took a sarcastic jab at Draymond. The young lad got some courage. \u201cMan, you can\u2019t go on so long with all that. Stop getting so many goddamn fouls.\u201d He said with a smirk on his face. He knew exactly what he was talking about as he took a hilarious jab at the big man. This video gained traction on social media, and the fans couldn\u2019t help but laugh their hearts out at this interaction between the youngster and Green.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Overtime (@overtime)\n\nWhat makes this even more interesting is the timing of this joke. This comes just days after the 34-year-old revealed he received a rather unconventional warning from the league\u2019s president. The Golden State forward seemingly has been warned for being \u201ctoo aggressive\u201c by President Adam Silver. Well, he had something to say on the matter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nThe NBA warns Draymond Green for playing too aggressively\n\nDraymond Green, on the latest episode of his podcast, The Draymond Green Show with Baron Davis, revealed that he received an interesting warning from the league recently. \u201cI got a warning apparently from the league the other day that the last few games I\u2019ve been playing too aggressively, and that they\u2019re warning me,\u201d he stated. Draymond further added, \u201cWhat does that mean? I don\u2019t know. But apparently, me being in \u2018Go Win\u2019 mode is a problem.\u201d\n\nUSA Today via Reuters Dec 12, 2023; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green (23) reacts after being called for a foul on Phoenix Suns center Jusuf Nurkic (20) during the third quarter at Footprint Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports.\n\nGreen was left scratching his head after the league told this to him. And why not? He couldn\u2019t help but wonder what playing \u2018too aggressive\u2019 meant. However, the Warriors player is no stranger to some aggressive actions on the court. Officials have penalized Green for his actions several times. The league suspended him six times over his career for various encounters. One such instance was when he hit Jusuf Nurkic in the face. Playing against the big man comes with risk!\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nAlso, this season, he was ejected from a game against Memphis, where he even tripped rookie Zach Edey. So, the warning might have been loading for some time for the Warriors star. Whether he\u2019ll learn from this warning or not remains to be seen, as Green is all fired up after the Butler trade. He and the Warriors aim to take another shot at the championship.",

            "content": "The current state of the NBA has drawn criticism from many, with some valid arguments. One of the most debated issues is the league\u2019s increasingly uniform style of play, particularly the excessive reliance on three-point shooting. Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green recently shared his thoughts on the modern game.\n\nWhen asked if today\u2019s style of play has become boring, Green didn\u2019t hold back\u2014his response is sure to make NBA Commissioner Adam Silver take notice. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Green said, via theScore. He elaborated by contrasting the current era with the challenge of facing basketball savant LeBron James.\n\n\u201cEvery possession is some kind of chess move,\u201d the four-time All-Star said, per SB Nation\u2019s Noa Dalzell. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that today in the NBA often\u2026 It\u2019s just who can run fast, who can hit more threes. There\u2019s no substance. So, I think it\u2019s very boring.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreen\u2019s remarks are particularly interesting given that many critics blame the Warriors\u2014and specifically Stephen Curry\u2014for ushering in this era of three-point-heavy basketball. Their dynasty revolutionized the sport, making perimeter shooting the focal point of offensive schemes while limiting teams\u2019 reliance on post play and intricate passing sequences. As a result, fans and analysts alike have lamented the decline of diverse offensive strategies, particularly low-post dominance and structured half-court play.\n\nKevin Durant #35, Draymond Green #23 and Klay Thompson #11 of the Golden State Warriors react with Stephen Curry #30 against the Utah Jazz during Game Two of the NBA Western Conference Semi-Finals\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Stephen Curry and the Warriors revolutionized the NBA\n\nLed by Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors fundamentally changed the way basketball is played in the NBA. Before their rise, the league was dominated by inside scoring, post play, and mid-range jumpers. However, the Warriors\u2019 embrace of three-point shooting, pace, and floor spacing completely reshaped offensive strategies. Curry\u2019s unparalleled shooting range and ability to pull up from anywhere on the court forced defenses to extend beyond the arc, creating unprecedented spacing and opening the floor for his teammates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nsee also NBA News: Stephen Curry sends emotional message to Warriors legend on jersey retirement\n\nAlongside Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, Curry\u2019s Warriors shattered records, proving that three-point shooting could be the foundation of a dynasty rather than just a complementary tool. Beyond their shooting revolution, the Warriors redefined team basketball with their emphasis on ball movement, defensive versatility, and positionless play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Warriors\u2019 success\u2014winning four championships in eight seasons (2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022)\u2014set a new standard for the league. Teams across the NBA have since prioritized three-point shooting, fast-paced offense, and versatile defenders, ushering in an era where spacing and perimeter efficiency reign supreme.",

Wildfire relief. The event was held at two venues; the Intuit Dome and the Kia Forum. All donations were advised under the Annenberg Foundation, who will distribute the funds for short-term and long-term relief in Southern California.\n\nThe lineup for the Intuit Dome consisted of Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, Katy Perry, Olivia Rodrigo, Lil Baby, Gracie Abrams, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Earth Wind and Fire, Jelly Roll, Peso Pluma, Rod Stewart, and Tate McRae.\n\nKia Forum had performers No Doubt, Green Day, Red Hot Chili Peppers, P!nk, Stevie Nicks, Alanis Morissette, Anderson .Paak, John Fogerty, Graham Nash, Stephen Stills, The Black Crowes, Dawes, Joni Mitchell, and John Mayer.\n\nAll of the funds raised at the venues went directly to the beneficiaries while the basketball team, the L.A Clippers covered the expenses of the event. FireAid raised an estimated 100 million from these events. You can still donate on the FireAid website, and the concerts themselves can be viewed on streaming sites and social media for those who missed them.\n\nBetween acts, survivors and first responders told stories in-person or over video broadcasts about evacuating and losing their homes to the devastating fires. Stevie Nicks dedicated her performance of \u201cLandslide\u201d to the first responders who saved her home in the Pacific Palisades after giving the audience a brief recollection of her own evacuation story.\n\nThe show was full of surprise guests and songs, along with the momentary reunion of No Doubt and the remaining members of Nirvana. Billie Eilish made an appearance on stage during Green Day\u2019s performance, as did Dr. Dre and Sheila E. on Anderson Paak\u2019s set. Lady Gaga debuted \u201cTime Is A Healer,\u201d which was written with her fianc\u00e9 for the event and Jelly Roll brought out Blink 182\u2019s Travis Barker to his set.\n\nThe wildfires that occurred this January have affected many areas across Southern California, areas include: Palisades, Eaton, Bert, Hurst, Sunset, Sunswept, Kenneth and Hughes counties in Los Angeles, Riverside County in San Bernardino, Olivas County and Laguna County in Ventura, Lilac County and Border 2 County in San Diego. The fires took anywhere from one day to two weeks to contain, claiming tens of thousands of buildings and the lives of at least 29 people.\n\nThere are many other organizations that people can donate to that will provide relief to wildfire survivors other than FireAid. The California Community Foundation has started a Wildfire Recovery Fund, focused primarily on the long-term recovery of neighborhoods. The United Way of Greater Los Angeles has started a Wildfire Response Fund that supports low-income individuals and urgent needs. The California Fire Foundation has been providing financial relief to impacted residents, as well as support for first responders.\n\nThere are many other foundations that are readily available with a quick Google search as well. It can be difficult to differentiate from scam charities, so make sure the foundation you may donate to is reputable and ethical.",

            "content": "What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Intuit:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.16 = US$3.8b \u00f7 (US$33b - US$8.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2024).\n\nSo, Intuit has an ROCE of 16%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Software industry average of 8.2% it's much better.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Intuit\n\nNasdaqGS:INTU Return on Capital Employed February 13th 2025\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Intuit's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Intuit .\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nIn terms of Intuit's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 42%, but since then they've fallen to 16%. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.\n\nOur Take On Intuit's ROCE\n\nWhile returns have fallen for Intuit in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. Furthermore the stock has climbed 95% over the last five years, it would appear that investors are upbeat about the future. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nOne more thing, we've spotted 1 warning sign facing Intuit that you might find interesting.\n\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

            "content": "Derrick Jones Jr. of the Clippers and Johnny Davis of the Grizzlies vie for a loose ball in the first half.\n\nWhat started as a back-and-forth battle between the Clippers, who have one of the NBA\u2019s best defenses, and the Memphis Grizzlies, who have the league\u2019s top offense, was decided by the Clippers\u2019 36-point third quarter, which led them to a 128-114 victory Wednesday night at the Intuit Dome.\n\nThe Clippers, led by Kawhi Leonard and James Harden, saw their lead surge to as many as 23 points in the third, too great for the Grizzlies, who were playing without Ja Morant.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the way we want to play every night,\u201d said Leonard, who had 25 points, five rebounds and four assists in a season-high 34 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeonard emphasized the importance of learning from their early mistakes, when the Clippers held a 66-63 halftime lead, especially after \u201cseeing what we\u2019ve been doing in the first half and not wanting to make those same mistakes.\u201d\n\nWith several moving parts on the roster because of last week\u2019s trade-deadline moves, the Clippers still are working to build chemistry and acclimate new players. But the second half showcased their potential.\n\n\u201cAt our best, we can be a really good team,\u201d said Harden, who finished with 18 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds. He added that the team needs \u201cmore consistency, more effort throughout the course of four quarters.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA three-pointer in the third quarter gave Harden his 26,974th point, moving him into sole possession of 13th on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list, surpassing Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\n\u201cToday was my dream. [He was] somebody I looked up to and kind of wanted to mold and do things in the sense of what he brought to that city,\u201d said Harden, who, like Olajuwon, played in Houston. \u201c\u2026 So that was a little bit more special.\u201d\n\nNorman Powell steals the ball from Luke Kennard in the second half. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Clippers (30-23) entered their final game of the first half Thursday night at Utah sitting 2\u00bd games behind the Lakers in the Pacific Division.\n\n\u201cTo be able to win games, put yourself in position to be the sixth seed now, we got a chance to really take off and get better,\u201d Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. \u201cTo be where we\u2019re at today, I\u2019m just happy with the guys.\u201d\n\nThe break will allow the Clippers to reset \u2014 integrating new players like Bogdan Bogdanovic and Ben Simmons while continuing to ramp up Leonard\u2019s participation.\n\nLeonard logged his third game of 30-plus minutes and was expected to miss Thursday\u2019s matchup against the Jazz, as he has not yet been cleared to play in back-to-back games.\n\nBefore Wednesday\u2019s game, Lue said he would insert guard Kris Dunn into the starting lineup to alleviate the pressure the Grizzlies presented on offense. This move was a boost for the Clippers, with Dunn \u2014 who replaced Derrick Jones Jr. \u2014 delivering his largest scoring output of the season.\n\nDunn finished with 14 points and set a season high from beyond the arc, making all four of his three-point shots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe could be a really good defensive group when we buy in. They drew up a really good game plan for us to follow,\u201d Dunn said of the coaches.\n\nHe played an all-around productive game, adding five assists, five steals and three rebounds.\n\nWhile the Grizzlies entered the game boasting the highest-scoring offense in the league (123.5 ppg), they were without their superstar point guard, forcing them to look elsewhere for offense. The two-time All-Star, who averages 20.7 points, 7.4 assists and 4.3 rebounds, was ruled out just before tipoff because of knee soreness.\n\nThis absence proved to be the Grizzlies\u2019 downfall, as the Clippers \u2014 who came into the game ranked third in points given up per game (107.8) and steals (9.4) \u2014 took advantage of bad matchups and stifled Memphis\u2019 offense.\n\nOne of the league\u2019s top defensive teams, the Clippers had 17 steals, forced 21 turnovers and scored 41 points off them, all of which played a significant role in keeping the Grizzlies below their season average.\n\nNorman Powell added 18 points while Ivica Zubac contributed a double-double with 13 rebounds and 12 points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBogdanovic made his Clippers debut after arriving from the Atlanta Hawks at the trade deadline. The three-point specialist nailed his first three-point attempt to much fanfare. The Serbian played 18 minutes and scored seven points, and after the game he described his Clippers tenure as \u201ca new journey,\u201d especially with the chance to share the court with Leonard and Harden.\n\nSimmons, meanwhile, sat out for reconditioning but was expected to make his Clippers debut Thursday.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Large-Cap Stocks Insiders Are Selling Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stands against the other large-cap stocks. We previously covered 10 Large-Cap Stocks Insiders Are Buying Recently.\n\nWhy should investors track insider moves? Is it a bad sign for the company when insiders sell their shares? Not necessarily; just like insider buying activity doesn\u2019t always mean the stock is heading for growth. Both insider selling and buying can be driven by various motives, it's important to consider these moves within the broader context of the company\u2019s fundamentals, industry trends, and overall market conditions.\n\nHowever, insiders or people in high positions within a company\u2014such as executives and directors, often have precious insights into the company\u2019s strategy, plans, next moves and initiatives. Sometimes, for example, when a CEO or CFO invests their own money to acquire company shares, it can signal strong confidence in the company\u2019s potential.\n\nSimilarly, when insiders are selling their shares, it can sometimes mean that the management is losing confidence. On the other hand, it also happens that large shareholders just want to trim their holdings to more appropriate position sizes based on the risk/reward. Insiders can also decide to sell their shares due to personal financial reasons that have nothing to do with the company.\n\nThis means that both insider selling and buying can be driven by various motives, and therefore, any insider trading activity should be carefully analyzed only with other factors. That\u2019s why due diligence before any investment is of the utmost importance. However, insider trading activity in combination with other relevant determinants can offer valuable insights into a company\u2019s capabilities, helping investors make more informed investment decisions.\n\nTo identify the 10 large-cap stocks insiders are selling recently, we considered only stocks with a market capitalization of more than $10 billion. We first used Insider Monkey\u2019s insider trading stock screener and looked for stocks with at least two insiders selling over the last two months.",

            "content": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products .\n\nIf you haven't already switched, we rounded up the best Mint alternatives to replace the app that shut down.\n\nAs a long-time Mint user, I was frustrated to say the least when news broke at the end of 2023 that Intuit would shut Mint down. I, like millions of others, enjoyed how easily Mint allowed us to track all accounts in one place and monitor credit scores. I also used it regularly to track spending, set goals like pay my mortgage down faster and with general money management.\n\n\n\nSo I set out to find the best Mint alternatives in the wake of its disappointing demise. I gave Credit Karma, Intuit\u2019s other financial app, a try but found it to be a poor Mint substitute. The following guide lays out my experience testing some of the most popular Mint replacement apps available today in search of my next budgeting app.\n\n\n\nOur pick for best Mint alternative remains Quicken Simplifi, even months after the Mint shutting down, thanks to its easy to use app, good income and bill detection and its affordable price. But there are plenty of other solid options out there for those with different needs. If you\u2019re also on the hunt for a budgeting app to replace Mint, we hope these details can help you decide which of the best budgeting apps out there will be right for you.\n\nTable of contents\n\nBest Mint alternatives in 2025\n\nQuicken The best Mint alternative overall Quicken Simplifi Monthly cost: $4 | Tracks spending: Yes | Investment tracking: Yes | Links to bank accounts: Yes | Mobile app: iOS, Android A complete, easy-to-use app that costs less than the competition \u2014 and feels the most like Mint. Pros Easy-to-use app with a gentle learning curve\n\nDoes a good job detecting recurring income and bills\n\nLess expensive than the competition\n\nLets you share app access with a spouse or financial advisor\n\nHandy refund tracker Cons No free trial\n\nYou can't create an account using your Apple or Google ID\n\nNo Zillow integration $48/year at Quicken\n\nNo pun intended, but what I like about Quicken Simplifi is its simplicity. Whereas other budgeting apps try to distinguish themselves with dark themes and customizable emoji, Simplifi has a clean user interface, with a landing page that you just keep scrolling through to get a detailed overview of all your stats. These include your top-line balances; net worth; recent spending; upcoming recurring payments; a snapshot of your spending plan; top spending categories; achievements; and any watchlists you\u2019ve set up. You can also set up savings goals elsewhere in the app. I also appreciate how it offers neat, almost playful visualizations without ever looking cluttered. I felt at home in the mobile and web dashboards after a day or so, which is faster than I adapted to some competing services (I\u2019m looking at you, YNAB and Monarch).\n\nGetting set up with Simplifi was mostly painless. I was particularly impressed at how easily it connected to Fidelity; not all budget trackers do, for whatever reason. This is also one of the only services I tested that gives you the option of inviting a spouse or financial advisor to co-manage your account. One thing I would add to my initial assessment of the app, having used it for a few months now: I wish Simplifi offered Zillow integration for easily tracking your home value (or at least a rough estimate of it). Various competitors including Monarch Money and Copilot Money work with Zillow, so clearly there's a Zillow API available for use. As it stands, Simplifi users must add real estate manually like any other asset.\n\nDana Wollman / Engadget\n\nIn practice, Simplifi miscategorized some of my expenses, but nothing out of the ordinary compared to any of these budget trackers. As you\u2019re reviewing transactions, you can also mark if you\u2019re expecting a refund, which is a unique feature among the services I tested. Simplifi also estimated my regular income better than some other apps I tested. Most of all, I appreciated the option of being able to categorize some, but not all, purchases from a merchant as recurring. For instance, I can add my two Amazon subscribe-and-saves as recurring payments, without having to create a broad-strokes rule for every Amazon purchase.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nThe budgeting feature is also self-explanatory and can likely accommodate your preferred budgeting method. Just check that your regular income is accurate and be sure to set up recurring payments, making note of which are bills and which are subscriptions. This is important because Simplifi shows you your total take-home income as well as an \u201cincome after bills\u201d figure. That number includes, well, bills but not discretionary subscriptions. From there, you can add spending targets by category in the \u201cplanned spending\u201d bucket. Planned spending can also include one-time expenditures, not just monthly budgets. When you create a budget, Simplifi will suggest a number based on a six-month average.\n\nNot dealbreakers, but two things to keep in mind as you get started: Simplifi is notable in that you can\u2019t set up an account through Apple or Google. There is also no option for a free trial, though Quicken promises a \u201c30-day money back guarantee.\u201d\n\nMonarch Money The best Mint alternative (runner-up) Monarch Money Monthly cost: Starts at $9 | Tracks spending: Yes | Investment tracking: Yes | Links to bank accounts: Yes | Mobile app: iOS, Android A robust budgeting app that\u2019s a little harder to use than our top pick, but not prohibitively so. (Power users might not mind.) Pros Lots of detail and opportunities for customization\n\nHelpful \u201cgoals\u201d feature\n\nYou can grant account access to other people\n\nChrome extension for importing from Mint\n\nMonth-in-review recap is more thorough than most\n\nCar value syncing\n\nZillow integration Cons Steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers\n\nThe mobile app feels restricted and less intuitive than the web version\n\nDoesn\u2019t seem to distinguish between bills and other recurring expenses\n\nSome bugginess on mobile around creating rules for expense categories $50 a year at Monarch Money\n\nMonarch Money grew on me. My first impression of the budgeting app, which was founded by a former Mint product manager, was that it's more difficult to use than others on this list, including Simplifi, NerdWallet and Copilot. And it is. Editing expense categories, adding recurring transactions and creating rules, for example, is a little more complicated than it needs to be, especially in the mobile app. (My advice: Use the web app for fine-tuning details.) Monarch also didn\u2019t get my income right; I had to edit it.\n\nOnce you\u2019re set up, though, Monarch offers an impressive level of granularity. In the budgets section, you can see a bona fide balance sheet showing budgets and actuals for each category. You'll also find a forecast, for the year or by month. And recurring expenses can be set not just by merchant, but other parameters as well. For instance, while most Amazon purchases might be marked as \u201cshopping,\u201d those for the amounts of $54.18 or $34.18 are definitely baby supplies, and can be automatically marked as such each time, not to mention programmed as recurring payments. Weirdly, though, there\u2019s no way to mark certain recurring payments as bills, specifically.\n\nDana Wollman / Engadget\n\nNot long after I first published this story in December 2023, Monarch introduced a detailed reporting section where you can create on-demand graphs based on things like accounts, categories and tags. That feature is available just on the web version of the app for now. As part of this same update, Monarch added support for an aggregator that makes it possible to automatically update the value of your car. This, combined with the existing Zillow integration for tracking your home value, makes it easy to quickly add a non-liquid asset like a vehicle or real estate, and have it show up in your net worth graph.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nThe mobile app is mostly self-explanatory. The main dashboard shows your net worth; your four most recent transactions; a month-over-month spending comparison; income month-to-date; upcoming bills; an investments snapshot; a list of any goals you\u2019ve set; and, finally, a link to your month-in-review. That month-in-review is more detailed than most, delving into cash flow; top income and expense categories; cash flow trends; changes to your net worth, assets and liabilities; plus asset and liability breakdowns. In February 2024, Monarch expanded on the net worth graph, so that if you click on the Accounts tab you can see how your net worth changed over different periods of time, including one month, three months, six months, a year or all time.\n\nOn the main screen, you\u2019ll also find tabs for accounts, transactions, cash flow, budget and recurring. Like many of the other apps featured here, Monarch can auto-detect recurring expenses and income, even if it gets the category wrong. (They all do to an extent.) Expense categories are marked by emoji, which you can customize if you\u2019re so inclined.\n\nMonarch Money uses a combination of networks to connect with banks, including Plaid, MX and Finicity, a competing network owned by Mastercard. (I have a quick explainer on Plaid, the industry standard in this space, toward the end of this guide.) As part of an update in late December, Monarch has also made it easier to connect through those other two networks, if for some reason Plaid fails. Similar to NerdWallet, I found myself completing two-factor authentication every time I wanted to get past the Plaid screen to add another account. Notably, Monarch is the only other app I tested that allows you to grant access to someone else in your family \u2014 likely a spouse or financial advisor. Monarch also has a Chrome extension for importing from Mint, though really this is just a shortcut for downloading a CSV file, which you\u2019ll have to do regardless of where you choose to take your Mint data.\n\nAdditionally, Monarch just added the ability to track Apple Card, Apple Cash, and Savings accounts, thanks to new functionality brought with the iOS 17.4 update. It's not the only one either; currently, Copilot and YNAB have also added similar functionality that will be available to anyone with the latest versions of their respective apps on a device running iOS 17.4. Instead of manually uploading statements, the new functionality allows apps like Monarch's to automatically pull in transactions and balance history. That should make it easier to account for spending on Apple cards and accounts throughout the month.\n\nMonarch also recently launched investment transactions in beta. It also says bill tracking and an overhauled goals system are coming soon. Monarch hasn't provided a timeline for that last one, except to say that the improved goals feature is coming soon.\n\nCopilot Money The best up-and-comer Copilot Money Monthly cost: Starts at $8 | Tracks spending: Yes | Investment tracking: Yes | Links to bank accounts: Yes | Mobile app: iOS A beautifully designed and reasonably priced app with lots of features in development \u2014 including Android and web apps. Pros Slick UI\n\nStandalone Mac app\n\nLower monthly price than some competing apps\n\nDoes a good job visualizing recurring expenses\n\nOptional Amazon, Venmo and Zillow integration\n\n\u201cTo review\u201d section is handy Cons No web or Android app yet\n\nMiscategorized more expenses than our top pick\n\nLots of otherwise common features are still in development Two months free at Copilot Money\n\nCopilot Money might be the best-looking budgeting app I tested. It also has the distinction of being exclusive to iOS and Macs \u2014 at least for now. Andres Ugarte, the company\u2019s CEO, has publicly promised that Android and web apps are coming soon. But until it follows through, I can\u2019t recommend Copilot for most people with so many good competitors out there.\n\nCopilot Money for Web and Android!\n\n\n\nThanks to the support from our users, and the overwhelming positive reception we're seeing from folks migrating from Mint, we can now say that we'll be building @copilotmoney for Web and Android with a goal to launch in 2024.\n\n\n\nWe'll continue to\u2026 \u2014 Andres Ugarte (@chuga) November 15, 2023\n\nThere are other features that Copilot is missing, which I\u2019ll get into. But it is promising, and one to keep an eye on. It\u2019s just a fast, efficient, well designed app, and Android users will be in for a treat when they\u2019ll finally be able to download it. It makes good use of colors, emoji and graphs to help you understand at a glance how you\u2019re doing on everything from your budgets to your investment performance to your credit card debt over time. In particular, Copilot does a better job than almost any other app of visualizing your recurring monthly expenses.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nBehind those punchy colors and cutesy emoji, though, is some sophisticated performance. Copilot\u2019s AI-powered \u201cIntelligence\u201d gets smarter as you go at categorizing your expenses. (You can also add your own categories, complete with your choice of emoji.) It\u2019s not perfect. Copilot miscategorized some purchases (they all do), but it makes it easier to edit than most. On top of that, the internal search feature is very fast; it starts whittling down results in your transaction history as soon as you begin typing.\n\nDana Wollman / Engadget\n\nCopilot is also unique in offering Amazon and Venmo integrations, allowing you to see transaction details. With Amazon, this requires just signing into your Amazon account via an in-app browser. For Venmo, you have to set up fwd@copilot.money as a forwarding address and then create a filter, wherein emails from venmo@venmo.com are automatically forwarded to fwd@copilot.money. Like Monarch Money, you can also add any property you own and track its value through Zillow, which is integrated with the app.\n\nWhile the app is heavily automated, I still appreciate that Copilot marks new transactions for review. It\u2019s a good way to both weed out fraudulent charges, and also be somewhat intentional about your spending habits.\n\nLike Monarch Money, Copilot updated its app to make it easier to connect to banks through networks other than Plaid. As part of the same update, Copilot said it has improved its connections to both American Express and Fidelity which, again, can be a bugbear for some budget tracking apps. In an even more recent update, Copilot added a Mint import option, which other budgeting apps have begun to offer as well.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nBecause the app is relatively new (it launched in early 2020), the company is still catching up to the competition on some table-stakes features. Ugarte told me that his team is almost done building out a detailed cash flow section as well. On its website, Copilot also promises a raft of AI-powered features that build on its current \u201cIntelligence\u201d platform, the one that powers its smart expense categorization. These include \u201csmart financial goals,\u201d natural language search, a chat interface, forecasting and benchmarking. That benchmarking, Ugarte tells me, is meant to give people a sense of how they\u2019re doing compared to other Copilot users, on both spending and investment performance. Most of these features should arrive in the new year.\n\nCopilot does a couple interesting things for new customers that distinguish it from the competition. There\u2019s a \u201cdemo mode\u201d that feels like a game simulator; no need to add your own accounts. The company is also offering two free months with RIPMINT \u2014 a more generous introductory offer than most. When it finally does come time to pony up, the $7.92 monthly plan is cheaper than some competing apps, although the $95-a-year-option is in the same ballpark.\n\nNerdWallet The best free budgeting app NerdWallet Monthly cost: $0 | Tracks spending: Yes | Investment tracking: Yes | Links to bank accounts: Yes | Mobile app: iOS, Android The best free budget tracking app you can get (and there aren\u2019t many compromises besides the ever-present ads). Pros Free\n\nEasy to use\n\nHelpful weekly insights\n\nNerdWallet has a deep well of helpful financial explainers and guides\n\nOne of the few options that offers credit score monitoring Cons Ads everywhere\n\nNo customization for spending categories\n\nLess adept at detecting regular income\n\nOne of the more tedious setup processes Free at NerdWallet\n\nYou may know NerdWallet as a site that offers a mix of personal finance news, explainers and guides. I see it often when I google a financial term I don\u2019t know and sure enough, it\u2019s one of the sites I\u2019m most likely to click on. As it happens, NerdWallet also has the distinction of offering one of the only free budgeting apps I tested. In fact, there is no paid version; nothing is locked behind a paywall. The main catch: There are ads everywhere. To be fair, the free version of Mint was like this, too.\n\nEven with the inescapable credit card offers, NerdWallet has a clean, easy-to-understand user interface, which includes both a web and a mobile app. The key metrics that it highlights most prominently are your cash flow, net worth and credit score. (Of note, although Mint itself offered credit score monitoring, most of its rivals do not.) I particularly enjoyed the weekly insights, which delve into things like where you spent the most money or how much you paid in fees \u2014 and how that compares to the previous month. Because this is NerdWallet, an encyclopedia of financial info, you get some particularly specific category options when setting up your accounts (think: a Roth or non-Roth IRA).\n\nDana Wollman / Engadget\n\nAs a budgeting app, NerdWallet is more than serviceable, if a bit basic. Like other apps I tested, you can set up recurring bills. Importantly, it follows the popular 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which has you putting 50% of your budget toward things you need, 30% toward things you want, and the remaining 20% into savings or debt repayments. If this works for you, great \u2014 just know that you can\u2019t customize your budget to the same degree as some competing apps. You can\u2019t currently create custom spending categories, though a note inside the dashboard section of the app says \u201cyou\u2019ll be able to customize them in the future.\u201d You also can\u2019t move items from the wants column to \u201cneeds\u201d or vice versa but \u201cIn the future, you'll be able to move specific transactions to actively manage what falls into each group.\u201d A NerdWallet spokesperson declined to provide an ETA, though.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s worth noting that NerdWallet had one of the most onerous setup processes of any app I tested. I don\u2019t think this is a dealbreaker, as you\u2019ll only have to do it once and, hopefully, you aren\u2019t setting up six or seven apps in tandem as I was. What made NerdWallet\u2019s onboarding especially tedious is that every time I wanted to add an account, I had to go through a two-factor authentication process to even get past the Plaid splash screen, and that\u2019s not including the 2FA I had set up at each of my banks. This is a security policy on NerdWallet\u2019s end, not Plaid\u2019s, a Plaid spokesperson says.\n\nPrecisely because NerdWallet is one of the only budget trackers to offer credit score monitoring, it also needs more of your personal info during setup, including your birthday, address, phone number and the last four digits of your social security number. It\u2019s the same with Credit Karma, which also does credit score monitoring.\n\nRelated to the setup process, I found that NerdWallet was less adept than other apps at automatically detecting my regular income. In my case, it counted a large one-time wire transfer as income, at which point my only other option was to enter my income manually (which is slightly annoying because I would have needed my pay stub handy to double-check my take-home pay).\n\nYNAB Another Mint alternative we tested YNAB Monthly cost: Starts at $8 | Tracks spending: Yes | Investment tracking: Yes | Links to bank accounts: Yes | Mobile app: iOS, Android An app with a cult following that promotes a different, more hands-on approach to budgeting. Not for people who want a set-and-forget experience. Pros Particularly strong emphasis on budgeting\n\nUnique \u201czero-dollar\u201d approach to financial planning that some people swear by Cons Steep learning curve\n\nHarder to use certain features on the mobile app than on the web $99 a year or $14.99 a month at YNAB\n\nYNAB is, by its own admission, \u201cdifferent from anything you\u2019ve tried before.\u201d The app, whose name is short for You Need a Budget, promotes a so-called zero-based budgeting system, which forces you to assign a purpose for every dollar you earn. A frequently used analogy is to put each dollar in an envelope; you can always move money from one envelope to another in a pinch. These envelopes can include rent and utilities, along with unforeseen expenses like holiday gifts and the inevitable car repair. The idea is that if you budget a certain amount for the unknowns each month, they won\u2019t feel like they\u2019re sneaking up on you.\n\nImportantly, YNAB is only concerned with the money you have in your accounts now. The app does not ask you to provide your take-home income or set up recurring income payments (although there is a way to do this). The money you will make later in the month through your salaried job is not relevant, because YNAB does not engage in forecasting.\n\nThe app is harder to learn than any other here, and it requires more ongoing effort from the user. And YNAB knows that. Inside both the mobile and web apps are links to videos and other tutorials. Although I never quite got comfortable with the user interface, I did come to appreciate YNAB\u2019s insistence on intentionality. Forcing users to draft a new budget each month and to review each transaction is not necessarily a bad thing. As YNAB says on its website, \u201cSure, you\u2019ve got pie charts showing that you spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants \u2014 but you\u2019ve still spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants.\u201d I can see this approach being useful for people who don\u2019t tend to have a lot of cash in reserve at a given time, or who have spending habits they want to correct (to riff off of YNAB\u2019s own example, ordering Seamless four times a week).\n\nMy colleague Valentina Palladino, knowing I was working on this guide, penned a respectful rebuttal, explaining why she\u2019s been using YNAB for years. Perhaps, like her, you have major savings goals you want to achieve, whether it\u2019s paying for a wedding or buying a house. I suggest you give her column a read. For me, though, YNAB\u2019s approach feels like overkill.\n\nPocketGuard Another Mint alternative we tested PocketGuard Monthly cost: Starts at $6 | Tracks spending: Yes | Investment tracking: Yes | Links to bank accounts: Yes | Mobile app: iOS, Android A slightly rougher-around-the-edges user experience, but you still get lots of functionality for a lower price than others and more features coming soon. Pros One of the only budget trackers with a free plan\n\nYou can avoid an ongoing subscription fee by opting for a one-time lifetime license\n\nLess expensive than most competitors\n\nHelpful \u201cupcoming bills\u201d view in the app Cons The free version is so restricted that the \u201cfree\u201d label feels misleading; the user experience feels less polished than some competing apps\n\nThe web app doesn\u2019t take advantage of the larger screen space on desktop $7.99 a month or $34.99 a year at PocketGuard\n\nPocketGuard is one of the only reputable free budget trackers I found in my research. Just know it\u2019s far more restricted at the free tier than NerdWallet or Mint. In my testing, I was prompted to pay after I attempted to link more than two bank accounts. So much for free, unless you keep things simple with one cash account and one credit card. When it comes time to upgrade to PocketGuard Plus, you have three options: pay $7.99 a month, $34.99 a year or $79.99 for a one-time lifetime license. That lifetime option is actually one of the few unique selling points for me: I\u2019m sure some people will appreciate paying once and never having to, uh, budget for it again.\n\nFrom the main screen, you\u2019ll see tabs for accounts, insights, transactions and the \u201cPlan,\u201d which is where you see recurring payments stacked on top of what looks like a budget. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals.\n\nDana Wollman / Engadget\n\nLike some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an \u201cafter bills\u201d approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what\u2019s left, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income. Obviously, other apps have a different philosophy: take into account all of your post-tax income and use it to pay the bills, purchase things you want and maybe even save a little. But in PocketGuard, it\u2019s the \u201cin your pocket\u201d number that\u2019s most prominent. To PocketGuard\u2019s credit, it does a good job visualizing which bills are upcoming and which ones you\u2019ve already paid.\n\nPocketGuard has also publicly committed to adding some popular features. These include rollover budgeting, categorization rules and shared household access.\n\nDana Wollman / Engadget\n\nAlthough PocketGuard\u2019s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The \u201caccounts\u201d tab is a little busy, and doesn\u2019t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn\u2019t take advantage of the extra screen real estate.\n\nOf note, although PocketGuard does work with Plaid, its primary bank-connecting platform is actually Finicity. Setting up my accounts through Finicity was mostly a straightforward process. I did encounter one hiccup: Finicity would not connect to my SoFi account. I was able to do it through Plaid, but PocketGuard doesn\u2019t make it easy to access Plaid in the app. The only way, as far as I can tell, is to knowingly search for the name of a bank that isn\u2019t available through Finicity, at which point you get the option to try Plaid instead. Like I said: the experience can be janky.\n\nWhat is Plaid and how does it work?\n\nEach of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it\u2019s worth explaining in its own section what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, the company claims.\n\nTo be clear, you don\u2019t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including the budget trackers I tested for this guide. Once you find the \u201cadd an account\u201d option in whichever one you\u2019re using, you\u2019ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There\u2019s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you\u2019ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you\u2019ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well.\n\nAs the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn\u2019t note that in 2022 Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit for collecting \u201cmore financial data than was needed.\u201d As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices.\n\nIn a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that \u201cthe crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid\u2019s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.\u201d\n\nMy top Mint alternative picks\n\nTo conclude, you might be wondering what app I decided on for myself after all of this research. The answer is actually two apps: Quicken Simplifi, my overall top pick, and Copilot Money. For now, I am actively using both apps and still deciding, long-term, which I feel more comfortable with. I tend to prefer Copilot's fast, colorful user interface, but as I explained above, it's too lacking in table-stakes features for me to go so far as to name it the best overall option.\n\nHow to import your financial data from the Mint app\n\nMint users should consider getting their data ready to migrate to their new budgeting app of choice soon. Unfortunately, importing data from Mint is not as easy as entering your credentials from inside your new app and hitting \u201cimport.\u201d In fact, any app that advertises the ability to port over your stats from Mint is just going to have you upload a CSV file of transactions and other data.\n\nTo download a CSV file from Mint, do the following:\n\nSign into Mint.com and hit Transactions in the menu on the left side of the screen. Select an account, or all accounts. Scroll down and look for \u201cexport [number] transactions\u201d in smaller print. Your CSV file should begin downloading.\n\nNote: Downloading on a per-account basis might seem more annoying, but could help you get set up on the other side, if the app you\u2019re using has you importing transactions one-for-one into their corresponding accounts.\n\nHow we tested Mint alternatives\n\nBefore I dove into the world of budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to test, I consulted trusty ol\u2019 Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps they might be using. Some of the apps I found were free, just like Mint. These, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, \u201coffers\u201d) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.)\n\nSince this guide is meant to help Mint users find a permanent replacement, any services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web.\n\nOnce I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps (and remember, I really was looking for a Mint alternative myself), I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable Groundhog Day of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once.\n\nWhat about Rocket Money?\n\nRocket Money is another free financial app that tracks spending and supports things like balance alerts and account linking. If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we'll consider it in future updates.",

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software have returned -6.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Intuit falls in, has gained 1.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIntuit is expected to post earnings of $2.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.27 points to a change of +13.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.97 indicates a change of +14% from what Intuit is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Intuit.",

That\u2019s not the case for Apryl Stewart, the CEO of Skyview Concessions Incorporated, who is changing that narrative with her airport-based business. Her tale is one of resilience and opportunity.\n\nApryl\u2019s journey into the world of business was anything but conventional. \u201cI\u2019m a first-generation entrepreneur, and initially I was going to go into a more traditional career choice, which would have been education.\u201d But when she was in high school, a summer program at UC Berkeley exposed her to the potential in business. There, Apryl found the inspiration to set the trajectory for her future achievements.\n\nDespite the daunting challenges in the airport industry, particularly the stiff barriers in accessing capital, Apryl remained undeterred. Without tangible assets to use as collateral, traditional funding sources were off-limits. However, thanks to funding from companies within the industry, Apryl was able to break into the sector and start to make a name for herself.\n\nThe sky\u2019s the limit with the right support\n\nThrough the Intuit IDEAS program, Apryl gained skills and tools essential to elevating her business operations. For example, the QuickBooks product provides her with deep insights into her venture\u2019s financial health and helps her make more informed business decisions.\n\nApryl feels a newfound sense of ownership over her company, empowered by her Intuit IDEAS journey. The program helped her unlock new opportunities with strategies she obtained. With the support of the Intuit Expert Network and her business coaches, she learned to maximize the benefits of Intuit\u2019s products and can now do a more effective job of marketing her brand and attracting new customers.\n\nApryl is grateful to have the confidence and commitment to do good business and help her community. She says, \u201cThe IDEAS program has had an immediate impact on my business \u2026 enhancing my financial literacy [and] helping me to make decisions for my business as I\u2019m looking to level up.\u201d Apryl envisions a future where Skyview Concessions does not merely participate in the market but leads it.\n\nThe support and mentorship Apryl\u2019s received have been instrumental in her journey. This networking finally paid off when she won her first airport contract\u2014a rare feat for a newcomer in such a complex industry. \u201cNow I have multiple locations from Los Angeles to San Francisco,\u201d she says.\n\nBringing positivity as part of her brand\n\nBeyond her business acumen, Apryl brings an infectiously positive attitude to every part of her life. Plus, now she\u2019s equipped with professional skills and a robust support system with help from Intuit IDEAS.\n\nApryl Stewart\u2019s story stands as a beacon to upcoming entrepreneurs that with vision, resilience, and the right support, the sky\u2019s the limit.\n\nAbout Intuit IDEAS\n\nIDEAS stands for Invest, Develop, Empower, Accelerate and Scale.\n\nIntuit IDEAS is a program empowering small business owners in cities across the United States to help improve entrepreneurs with their functioning, efficiency, earnings, and capital readiness.\n\nThrough Intuit IDEAS, small business owners receive free access to Intuit\u2019s AI-driven expert platform and products, including QuickBooks, Mailchimp, and TurboTax. In addition to support from Intuit\u2019s expert network, Intuit IDEAS participants also receive business counseling, executive coaching, and a grant to help them grow their businesses.

            "content": "American Council of Engineering Companies, California\n\nIntuit Dome realized owner Steve Ballmer\u0092s vision for the NBA Los Angeles Clippers to play in an iconic venue within a complex that houses all team functions under a single roof. The 18,000-seat arena is the NBA\u0092s most environmentally friendly arena and benefits the Inglewood community year-round. The venue anchors a 1.14 million-square-foot facility including state-of-the-art practice and training facilities, team offices, fan gathering spaces, and indoor and outdoor basketball courts open to the public. The distinctive diagrid shell roof, covered in diamond-shaped ETFE and PTFE fabric panels, is designed to resemble a basketball net, making Intuit Dome stand out from other NBA arenas.\n\nWalter P Moore\u0092s team of structural, enclosure, seismic, and construction engineering specialists blended their expertise to optimize the roof geometry, connections, and panel layouts to achieve the goals of strength, beauty, and practicality. Seismic safety was a concern because the site is 1.25 miles from the Newport-Inglewood Fault.\n\nThe team created an elegant and ingenious solution that allows the light diagrid shell to behave independently from the much stiffer main arena structure that supports it during a seismic event. They connected the diagrid shell to the arena roof at its top and then laterally supported it at node points down its height with innovative toggle-brace connections. The toggle-braces provide lateral and gravity support while allowing the shell to \u0093swish like a hula skirt\u0094 around the more rigid brace frame structure. Intuit Dome also features an enormous one-of-a-kind \u0093Halo\u0094 board, a one-million pound, 360-degree, double-sided video board with retractable end pieces that are suspended from the roof, along with state-of-the-art rigging and catwalk systems that enhance the venue\u0092s capabilities.\n\nIntuit Dome is a fully electric facility with sufficient solar panels and batteries to power the arena for an entire concert or basketball game. It is the first NBA arena to achieve LEED Platinum certification under LEED v4. Walter P Moore reduced embodied carbon in the concrete by over 20 percent by collaborating with the concrete supplier to obtain supply-chain-specific Environmental Produce Declarations for all concrete mixes; as a result, the concrete is 50 percent more energy efficient than required by the California Green Building Code.\n\nThe complex opened on budget and three months ahead of schedule in July 2024.",

            "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Intuit (INTU) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nIntuit currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.59, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.59 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 29 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 21 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 72.4% and 3.5% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for INTU\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for INTU\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Intuit here>>>\n\n\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Intuit, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",

(The Metro K Line stops just south of here.)\n\nA cool, shady seat on the edge of Edward Vincent Jr. Park. Paul Haddad / LAist )\n\nMap it!\n\nDownload it!\n\nWant to take this map with you? Click here and then select \"Send directions to your phone.\"\n\nOk, let's get started...\n\nInglewood has undergone major demographic shifts throughout its history beyond the well-trodden succession of Indian, Spanish and Mexican communities. Beginning in the 1970s, the city increasingly drew Black professionals and working-class families. This route covers all eras, with an emphasis on Downtown, which has vacillated between vibrant and struggling conditions over the decades.\n\nLike many SoCal communities, water is at the heart of why Inglewood is where it is. What better place to start this hike than at the place that nourished its rise? Twenty feet beyond the eastern driveway of the parking lot for Edward Vincent Jr. Park, look for a gated walkway that advertises the \u201cWillie Agee Playhouse,\u201d a beloved 55-seat community theater. Follow the path to the playhouse. Just before its entryway, turn right at the palm tree. Cross the grass to two stone markers nearby.\n\nMarkers to the wells that long quenched the thirst of locals. Paul Haddad / LAist )\n\nOne of the monuments contains a capped valve that used to control the bubbling waters of Centinela Springs (or as the Spanish called it, Aguaje de Centinela). An inscription reads, \u201cFrom Time Immemorial God\u2019s Blessing of Sweet Water to All His Creatures.\u201d Next to it, a plaque details the history of the former artesian well, one of the first Registered Historical Landmarks in California. Amazingly, the spring quenched the thirst of Inglewood residents as late as 1949 before it ran dry.\n\n\n\nWhat is a 'pumptrack'?\n\nThe concrete foundation that supports the old well includes a short, paved connection to another pedway. Turn right on this path, away from a magnificent outdoor amphitheater. Honestly, this whole park is the bomb, bustling with families and well-maintained recreational facilities, including the first pumptrack in Greater L.A. What\u2019s a pumptrack, you ask? Imagine a self-contained bicycle and skating course with lots of whoop-de-doos (mountain biker lingo for fun trail humps). Take in the organized chaos from the park\u2019s southern walkway, or relax on one of several mosaic-tiled benches melded into an old stone wall.\n\nAdmit it: This places makes you want to grab a bike and have a go. Paul Haddad / LAist )\n\nRise. Fall. Repeat.\n\nExit the park at its southwest corner, crossing to the other side of E. Florence Avenue. After three blocks, turn left onto North Market Street, the northern portal of downtown. Interestingly, Inglewood was rejuvenated after a damaging 1920 earthquake. Investors swooped in, making it the fastest-growing city in America from 1920 to 1925! As you stroll down Market, note the ornamental center median, which used to support the Los Angeles Railway.\n\nDespite having good bones, many historically significant buildings have struggled to secure tenants. At 115 N. Market, a former Fox Theatre has been slowly decaying for decades. Across the street, at 100 N. Market, a longtime bookstore never recovered after the pandemic. Its Mediterranean Revival building, erected in 1927 as the Bank of Inglewood, also awaits new life.\n\n\n\nExploring the DT hub\n\nThe place to go for stylist hats, cowboy boots and more. Paul Haddad / LAist )\n\nAnother block, however, reveals a brighter side of Downtown. Black pride public art abounds, and 139 S. Market hosts the popular Inglewood Marketplace (once a JC Penney). On the northeast corner of Market and Manchester Boulevard, the World Hat & Boot Mart occupies a Streamline Moderne building from 1927 that underwent a funky makeover in the 1960s, creating the architectural Frankenstein you see today. This intersection of Market and Manchester represents Inglewood\u2019s cultural nexus, as street events ranging from Jazz Fest to Juneteenth celebrations often spoke off from here.\n\nOne place that remains fixed: Dulan\u2019s Soul Food Kitchen at 202 E. Manchester \u2014 one block west of Market \u2014 an institution since 1975 and well worth visiting for their cornbread and candied yams alone.\n\nIf you find yourself at Dulan's, make sure you get some cornbread and candied yams. Paul Haddad / LAist )\n\nWhat\u2019s old is new\n\nAs you continue south on Market, the middle of the next block (233 S. Market) features an ornate brick building once owned by S.H. Kress, a defunct department store chain. Now a clothing outlet, the \u201cKress\u201d insignia is still visible near the roofline.\n\nOn the east side of the street, the former Ritz cinema fared better than the Fox. In an era of theatrical X-rated movies, it became a Pussycat Theatre in the 1970s, morphing, at long last, to the Miracle Theatre, a live-events venue that kept the marquee.\n\n\n\nThis is the turnaround point\n\nTime to return from whence you came. Go right on East Nutwood Street and right again on North La Brea Avenue, whose original name in these parts \u2014 Commercial Street \u2014 telegraphed its importance to the town\u2019s nascent business district. Today, the street\u2019s junction with Queen Street affords the best view of the nine-story Inglewood City Hall, erected in 1973. Its architect was Charles Luckman, he of the Los Angeles Convention Center, Madison Square Garden, and Inglewood\u2019s own Forum. More importantly, Luckman\u2019s pedigree was a symbol that Inglewood had truly arrived.\n\nWith plans afoot to further revitalize Downtown, ever-evolving Inglewood will no doubt look different upon subsequent visits. For now, after leaving City Hall, turn right on Florence Avenue to retrace your steps to where it all began.\n\n\n\nDone! Where to eat?\n\nAll that walking works up an appetite, right? We've already mentioned Dulan's. LAist's Associate Editor for Food and Culture Gab Chabr\u00e1n also suggests the following:\n\n\n\nWoody\u2019s Bar-B-Que #2\n\nThe spread at Woody's: The sauces are homemade. Brian Feinzimer / LAist )\n\nDon't be surprised to see the lines at Woody\u2019s Bar-B-Que spilling out into the moderately sized parking lot. It's that good.

            "content": "Competition is fierce among the biggest tax-prep software providers. Many consider TurboTax to be king, but it may not be the clear choice for everyone. Here\u2019s our point-by-point comparison to help sort out which is better for you.\n\nTurboTax vs. H&R Block: Cost\n\nFREE TIERS $0 + $0 per state filed. It allows you to file a 1040 for free, but you can\u2019t itemize or file full Schedules 1, 2 or 3. Roughly 37% of taxpayers are eligible. TurboTax Free Edition supports a simple Form 1040 and no schedules except for the earned income tax credit, child tax credit and student loan interest. $0 + $0 per state filed. Allows you to file a 1040 plus limited Schedules 1, 2 and 3, which makes it usable by a lot more people than most other free software packages. PAID PACKAGES Deluxe $69 + $59 per state. Itemize and claim several tax deductions and credits. Works well for business income but no expenses. Premium $129 + $59 per state. Investment reporting and rental income (Schedules D and E, and K-1s), plus business income, expenses on a Schedule C, home office deductions and features for freelancers. Access to tax pro support requires upgrading to TurboTax's Live Assisted packages, which range from $69 to $199, plus state fees of $54 to $64. Promotion: NerdWallet users can save up to an additional 10% on TurboTax. Deluxe $55 + $49 per state. Itemize and claim several tax deductions and credits. Works well for business income but no expenses. Premium $95 + $49 per state. For investors or rental property owners (Schedules D and E, and K-1s). Self-Employed $115 + $49 per state. For small-business owners, freelancers and independent contractors. All paid packages come with access to Tax Pro Chat and AI Tax Assist. Get started with TurboTax Get started with H&R Block\n\nOne note about prices: Providers frequently change them and may offer discounted services and packages toward the beginning of tax filing season. These markdowns tend to get replaced with surge pricing the closer we get to the tax filing deadline. We base our reviews on the list prices and not the discounts to reflect this. You can verify the latest price by clicking through to the provider's website.\n\nTurboTax vs. H&R Block: Features and ease of use\n\nOnly one entity determines how the math works on a tax return, and that\u2019s the IRS. So unless there\u2019s a programming error, you should get the same numerical \u201canswer\u201d no matter which tax software you use. But you still have to feed the software all of your information, and software varies in how it helps you do that. This is why we look at features and ease of use \u2014 we want to know which offerings are least likely to make you want to lose your cool.\n\nH&R Block\n\nH&R Block\u2019s interface is visually simple, straightforward and easy to use, and it steps up to explain concepts as you go. Skipping around to specific spots can be a little tricky, which isn't ideal, but a banner across the top keeps track of where you are in the filing process.\n\nEmbedded \"learn more\" links provide more information without having to wander around, the help menu is visible from all pages, and you can click to access the chat support portal throughout. Getting help from a tax pro comes as part of all the paid package types, but figuring out just how to access that help can be a little tricky for new users.\n\nTurboTax\n\nTurboTax\u2019s interface is like a chat with a tax preparer, and you can skip around if you need to. A banner running along the side keeps track of where you stand in the process and flags areas you still need to complete. It's easy to skip from one section to the next, which is helpful if you're not entirely ready to finish in one go.\n\nEmbedded links throughout the process offer tips, explainers and other resources. And help buttons can easily connect you to the searchable knowledge base, on-screen help, tax pro help and more.\n\nBoth H&R Block and TurboTax allow you to switch from a different software provider and import tax documents. And both have a mobile app, as well as tools to help you calculate the deduction value of donated items. Though almost a photo finish, we found TurboTax to excel over H&R Block when it comes to design and user experience.\n\nTurboTax vs. H&R Block: Tax support\n\nH&R Block and TurboTax each offer inline help and searchable knowledge bases, tech support, and access to tax pros. H&R Block's tax support services are notable as pricing for the paid packages includes access to a tax pro through chat or video \u2014 something that often requires upgrading to an entirely new package with other providers. However, if you're looking for a final review, you'll have to pay more.\n\nBoth TurboTax and H&R Block offer full-service and in-person filing. However, H&R's wide net of offices throughout the U.S. might make the face-to-face option far more accessible than TurboTax's offerings.\n\nH&R Block\n\nIf you use one of H&R Block\u2019s paid packages, you get access to the company\u2019s AI Tax Assist tool as well as unlimited chat or screen-sharing sessions with a human tax pro at any point while preparing your return. This is a pretty unique offering in the tax software world, as other providers either ask you to purchase another package type or require you to select a la carte tax pro services. Notably, the tax pro will not review, sign or e-file your return for you, though. For that, you'll need to add Tax Pro Review.\n\nH&R Block\u2019s Tax Pro Review offers a one-on-one review of your completed return with a human tax pro who will go over your documents and check for accuracy and possible missed deductions or credits; if you want, the tax pro will also sign and e-file your return for you. The cost generally starts at $55, and the review usually happens within three days\n\nH&R Block also offers another option: an enormous band of human tax preparers at the company\u2019s 10,000 or so offices around the world. Full-service help is available both virtually and at brick-and-mortar stores. It isn\u2019t free, of course (in-office and virtual appointments start at $89), but it helps to know you can go there if you get confused or stuck.\n\nTurboTax\n\nAll of TurboTax's standard paid package types can be upgraded to TurboTax Live Assisted packages, which offer unlimited on-demand screen sharing, phone and chat access to tax pros, as well as a one-on-one review with a tax pro before you file. You can talk on the fly to a tax pro via one-way video (you see them, but they don\u2019t see you; they just see your screen).\n\nTurboTax also offers Live Full Service, which does away with tax software altogether. Instead, you upload your tax documents and a human puts together your tax return. You\u2019ll be matched with a tax preparer, meet on a video call before they begin working, and then you\u2019ll meet again when your return is ready for review. The preparer files the return for you.\n\nLive Full Service starts at $129, but the final price may vary based on your actual tax situation and the forms used or included with your return. State returns are additional. TurboTax gives some Full Service filers the option to work with a local tax pro in person. Intuit says it vets the local pro, but be aware that you\u2019ll be venturing outside the TurboTax world. This means the pro may have different work hours, and the services they offer may be different than those advertised by TurboTax.\n\nRefunds options\n\nH&R Block and TurboTax each let you receive a federal refund via direct deposit to a bank account. Other options include getting an old-fashioned paper check, applying the refund to next year\u2019s taxes or directing the IRS to buy U.S. Savings Bonds with your refund. Both providers let you use your refund to pay for your tax-prep fees (but there is a separate fee for that).\n\nAudit support\n\nIf you're audited, it\u2019s important to know what kind of support you\u2019re getting from your tax software. First, be sure you know the difference between \u201csupport\u201d and \u201cdefense.\u201d With most providers, audit support (or \u201cassistance\u201d) typically means guidance about what to expect and how to prepare \u2014 that\u2019s it. Audit defense, on the other hand, gets you full representation before the IRS from a tax professional.\n\nH&R Block offers free audit support, but you also can buy a product called Worry-Free Audit Support. This gets you in contact with an enrolled agent to guide you through an audit. It includes IRS correspondence management, audit preparation and in-person audit representation from an enrolled agent; it costs $20. You could also add Tax Identity Shield for another $19.99, which provides personal assistance if it turns out criminals used your personal information to file a fake tax return.\n\nTurboTax gives customers free audit support from a tax pro to help you understand what\u2019s going on if you get that dreaded audit letter for a tax return you filed through the program; if TurboTax can\u2019t connect you with a pro, you\u2019ll get a refund or $30 if you used the Free Edition. If you want someone to represent you in front of the IRS, you\u2019ll need TurboTax\u2019s audit defense product, called MAX. It runs an extra $49 and includes features such as identity theft monitoring, loss insurance and restoration help.\n\nTurboTax vs. H&R Block: Which one is right for you?\n\nDespite its dominant market share in DIY tax prep, TurboTax may not be the clear choice for everyone. While both providers offer robust human support options, the level of help you get varies by cost and package type.\n\nH&R Block doesn\u2019t charge extra for tax pro support if you\u2019re using one of its paid packages \u2014 a big bonus, as most tax software charges additional fees for this type of help. However, this support doesn\u2019t come with a free final review, and the pro won\u2019t sign and file for you. For that, you\u2019ll need to upgrade to Tax Pro Review at an additional cost.\n\nFilers looking for unlimited tax pro support, including a final review and generous customer support hours, may lean toward TurboTax Live Assisted, which offers all of these features in one neat package despite a higher price.\n\nBoth providers also offer a great user experience, helping users to upload, import, and add their information efficiently and with guidance. However, we found that the experience of working within the TurboTax interface was more streamlined than that of H&R Block's.\n\n\u00bb Want all the details?

This tremendous response will continue steadily as LA Clippers owner (and former Microsoft CEO) Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie Snyder have renewed their pledge to match every donation.\n\nAll proceeds from FireAid are directed to the FireAid Grants Advisory Committee, 501(c)(3) charitable organization created for the event, composed of philanthropic figureheads of Los Angeles and led by the Annenberg Foundation. Per a release, the committee \u201chas been listening daily to affected communities, assessing local resource gaps to ensure aid reaches those most in need, and researching the handling of other fire disasters, such as those in Maui and Northern California.\u201d The first phase of grants will begin this month.\n\nWith a lineup packed with proud LA locals, FireAid\u2019s five-and-a-half-hour program maintained a solemn yet resolute mood as musicians and presenters offered personal reflections on the city they love and the path ahead. Split between the two vaunted venues, the event favored rock and The Forum and an eclectic mix of pop at Intuit Dome, together representing Los Angeles\u2019 rich musical past, present and future. Unmissable performances throughout the night included sets from Joni Mitchell, John Mayer and Stevie Nicks, plus a long-awaited Nirvana reunion, collaboration between Stephen Stills and Graham Nash and sit-ins from Sting and Flea on Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cHigher Ground.\u201d\n\nFor more information on FireAid and a donation window, visit fireaidla.org.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks To Buy For Financial Stability. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stands against other best stocks to buy for financial stability.\n\nInvesting in stocks is one of the most effective ways to build long-term financial stability. While stocks can be volatile in the short term, history has shown that they generate higher returns over time compared to other asset classes. With the right strategy, investing in stocks can help individuals accumulate wealth, hedge against inflation, and secure a comfortable retirement. Stocks have historically outperformed other investment vehicles, such as bonds and savings accounts. According to data from the S&P 500, the stock market has delivered an average annual return of about 10% before inflation over the past century. In contrast, bonds have yielded around 5\u20136%, while traditional savings accounts provide returns of less than 1% annually. Recent studies reinforce this trend. A 2024 report from JP Morgan Asset Management found that over any 20-year period, the likelihood of losing money in the stock market is close to zero. Even with market downturns, those who stay invested tend to see significant growth.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe power of compounding is a key reason why investing in stocks enhances financial stability. The earlier an individual starts investing, the greater the impact of compounding. For example, if an investor puts $5,000 annually into an index fund earning 8% per year, they would accumulate approximately $1.3 million over 40 years. This long-term growth potential allows individuals to plan for major life events, such as purchasing a home, funding education, or retiring comfortably. The US Federal Reserve reports that individuals with investment portfolios of at least $100,000 are significantly more likely to achieve financial security than those relying solely on savings. While stocks can be volatile, diversification helps reduce risk. A well-balanced portfolio containing stocks from different sectors, as well as international investments, can mitigate losses during market downturns.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we scoured investing forums, analyst reports, and advice from money managers and billionaires to compile a list of stock options that can provide financial stability to investors. These stocks belong to defensive sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and energy. Many of these companies have solid dividend histories and enjoy a stable market position. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).",

Show Pros, Cons, and More chevron down icon An icon in the shape of an angle pointing down.\n\nTurboTax Details\n\nDIY filing ranges from $0 to $89 (+$0 or $39 per state return)\n\nFull-service prep available for a higher fee\n\nMobile-friendly\n\nFederal and State Tax Filing\n\nTurboTax is one of the biggest players in online tax prep. This year the company made a noticeable shift toward recommending its expert-assisted and full-service experiences over its self-preparation filing plans.\n\nImport and Export Capabilities\n\nAll TurboTax plans allow you to scan or upload your tax documents to speed up data entry. You may also be able to easily import documents from a payroll provider, bank, or brokerage that partners with TurboTax.\n\nAccuracy and Error-Checking\n\nThe company offers an accuracy guarantee and says it will pay IRS and/or state penalties and interest charges related to underpayment of taxes due to calculation errors. If it's determined that you entered information improperly, the guarantee does not apply.\n\nIndividual filers are also guaranteed to receive their maximum refund with TurboTax. If you later file an amended return with identical information with another tax service and end up with a lower tax bill or higher refund, you can file a claim with TurboTax to have your preparation fees refunded.\n\nIf you receive an audit letter from the IRS, you have the ability to get one-on-one help from a tax professional at TurboTax at no extra cost. But the company and its experts cannot provide legal advice or represent you before the IRS.\n\nDeduction Finder\n\nTurboTax has debuted a new AI-powered Intuit Assist feature for tax season 2025. Among other time-saving tasks, the tool searches \"millions of data points\" to find deductions and credits you qualify for that could reduce what you owe or boost your refund.\n\nIntegration with Financial Tools\n\nTurboTax's parent company, Intuit, also owns the expense-tracking app QuickBooks. QuickBooks users may save time on tax preparation by importing data directly to TurboTax.\n\nIntuit also owns Credit Karma, a credit services company, and says customers who file taxes with TurboTax and are due a refund can get their money up to five days early if it's deposited into a Credit Karma Money checking or savings account.\n\nTurboTax Pros and Cons\n\nAdvantages of TurboTax\n\nFree Edition is available to about 37% of filers\n\nCan be good for complex tax situations that may require help navigating deductions and forms\n\nAbility to upgrade for instant access to an expert\n\nDisadvantages of TurboTax\n\nFree Edition excludes unemployment income and education tax credits\n\nMost expensive option for many tax situations\n\nPricing is obscure for online plans\n\nHow Much Does TurboTax Cost?\n\nTurboTax online offers four ways to file your taxes, depending on your unique tax needs. With all versions except the desktop computer software, you can start and enter your information at no cost. You only pay at the end when filing your federal and state tax returns.\n\nTurboTax generally costs more than other tax-preparation services. Packages beyond the basic version can run at least $100 total for a federal and state return. But pricing is not transparent, and it can take some hunting around on the website to find all the available product offerings.\n\nFree Edition\n\nThe Free Edition is available to filers with W-2 income, qualified retirement distributions, and limited 1099 interest and dividends. People with unemployment income, stock sales (including cryptocurrency), income from rental properties, and self-employment income won't qualify.\n\nAlso, it only allows claiming of the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, and the student loan interest deduction. Itemizing deductions or claiming other credits requires an upgrade.\n\nDeluxe Edition\n\n$39 (up to $69 during peak tax season)\n\nThe Deluxe Edition covers tax filers who have income from sources that are not covered by the Free Edition. It allows for itemized deductions and most other IRS schedules, with some notable exceptions, such as capital gains or losses.\n\nPremium Edition\n\n$89 (up to $129 during peak season)\n\nIf you have any income or losses to report from trading stocks, crypto, or bonds, you'll need to upgrade to TurboTax's Premium Edition. The company also says this is the best plan for contractors and freelancers claiming tax breaks such as the home office deduction.\n\nAnd this is the plan for you if you have any income, deductions, or credits related to a partnership reported on Schedule K-1.\n\nLive Assistance Plans\n\n$39 to $169 (peak season pricing ranges from $79 to $219)\n\nTurboTax's Live Assisted option gives you on-demand access to a tax pro to answer your questions while you prep your return yourself. The plans offered are the same as the DIY plans above, but you can consult an expert when needed (they're even available nights and weekends during tax season). Once complete, an expert can review your return for accuracy at no added cost.\n\nFull-Service Plans\n\nStarting at $89 (peak season pricing starts at $129)\n\nTurboTax's top-tier plan connects you with a TurboTax expert or a verified local tax pro matched to your situation to get your taxes done for you in as little as two hours.\n\nAfter an initial assessment, you'll get a cost estimate from your expert, based on how many tax forms need to be completed and filed with your return. The price is subject to change.\n\nYou upload all of your documents digitally and speak with the tax pro on a phone or video call when needed. You can track your return progress through the TurboTax app. Once complete, the tax pro signs your return and files it on your behalf.\n\nWhile TurboTax states that experts have \"extensive experience and training\" to help with all manner of tax situations and are up-to-date on the latest tax laws, it doesn't specify which tax credentials experts have. Licensed tax preparers, certified public accountants, tax attorneys, and enrolled agents are all qualified to prepare federal tax returns.\n\nState Filing Fees\n\nLike several online tax services, TurboTax charges extra for state returns, though there is no fee for those who qualify for $0 federal filing. For the paid do-it-yourself plans, each state return costs up to $39 (or $64 during peak tax season).\n\nFor the Live Assisted plans, a state return is an additional $39 to $49 ($59 to $69 during peak tax season). State returns are $49 each ($69 during peak tax season) with the Full Service plans.\n\nEstimate Your Taxes\n\nHow Does TurboTax Work?\n\nUser Interface and Design\n\nYou can work on your taxes on the TurboTax mobile app or desktop site, or switch back and forth.\n\nTurboTax excels at product integration. You can import tax forms directly from payroll providers, banks, and investment companies into the TurboTax system to auto-fill many of the prompts you'll encounter when preparing your return. You can also upload your tax return from last year from your computer or phone. Within the mobile app, you can take a photo of your income documents and upload supported forms.\n\nThere's also seamless integration for self-employed filers who use Quickbooks to keep track of expenses and tax payments.\n\nStep-by-Step Guidance\n\nTurboTax tells you what you need to enter to do your taxes based on your unique circumstances. The interface provides step-by-step guidance and directions for most tax forms.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nSupport Options Available\n\nTurboTax is an online tax preparation platform. While it connects filers with a network of experts nationwide, there are no in-person options.\n\nAs you prepare your return online, TurboTax's new AI-powered Intuit Assist can answer your questions to help you understand how tax rules apply to your situation. You can also find support from other TurboTax users and experts in the online forum.\n\nIf you purchase a Live Assisted package, experts can be reached at no extra charge between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. PT, beginning when the IRS starts accepting tax returns in mid-January until the federal filing deadline on April 15. In the off-season, experts are available from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT.\n\nTurboTax lists one general phone number for customer support on its website and a library of help articles.\n\nCustomer Service Experience\n\nOn Consumer Affairs, a business review platform, Intuit-TurboTax has more than 3,400 reviews, around 90% of which include 1-star ratings. Those mentioning \"customer service\" in particular were largely negative.\n\nSecurity and Privacy\n\nData Encryption and Security Measures\n\nTurboTax uses industry-standard encryption practices to protect your financial and personal data, including secure document uploads to your TurboTax account.\n\nLive Assisted packages allow you to share your screen with a TurboTax expert when you have a question about your taxes, but sensitive information, such as your Social Security number, will not be visible.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAny data you enter into the TurboTax platform remains there and will not be shared with other Intuit-owned properties, including Credit Karma and QuickBooks. This means, in part, that the information you share when preparing your tax return cannot be used to generate product recommendations for you. Read Intuit's full privacy policy here.\n\nTurboTax Alternatives\n\nTurboTax vs. H&R Block\n\nH&R Block and TurboTax both offer online tax prep, downloadable software, and full-service tax prep. But H&R Block is the only one with brick-and-mortar locations that support an in-person filing experience. Many Americans qualify for $0 tax prep, and both companies have been the subject of federal complaints for misleading advertising practices that pushed filers into paid plans. For the 2025 filing season, H&R Block's federal plan covers more situations than TurboTax's and its paid plans are more attractive because they include live expert help.\n\nRead our H&R Block review.\n\nTurboTax vs. FreeTaxUSA\n\nTurboTax has a full-service filing option in addition to self-preparation plans, while FreeTaxUSA is entirely self-paced. TurboTax has multiple features that give it an edge over FreeTaxUSA, like document import and upload capabilities and QuickBooks integration for business owners. But for situations that require a paid package at TurboTax, costs can add up.\n\nRead our FreeTaxUSA review.\n\nTurboTax vs. TaxSlayer\n\nTaxSlayer doesn't offer as many ways to prepare your taxes as TurboTax, but its self-preparation plans are cheaper and just as effective. Both companies offer access to expert assistance with paid packages. But easier navigation and quick importing of data from financial companies and expense trackers are features that give TurboTax a slight edge over TaxSlayer.\n\nRead our TaxSlayer review.\n\nTurboTax Customer Experience\n\nCompilation of User Feedback\n\nIntuit-TurboTax has not been extensively reviewed by customers on Trustpilot, a popular platform for reviewing businesses. Of the roughly 500 reviews, nearly 95% gave the company 1- and 2-star ratings. Several customers complained of deceptive pricing and unhelpful, if not misguided, advice from customer service agents and experts.\n\nTurboTax also publishes reviews of its tax-filing products on its website, which show an average rating of 4.6 stars out of 5 across more than 600,000 reviews. It's unclear how the reviews are solicited or selected to appear on the website.\n\nOverall Rating and Satisfaction\n\nIntuit has been embroiled in controversy since at least 2020, when the Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation into TurboTax's advertising practices around its \"free\" tax-filing products.\n\nIn 2024, the FTC called a series of ad campaigns guaranteeing free tax prep willfully deceptive, since more than two-thirds of tax filers don't qualify, and ordered the company to stop airing them until they included the proper disclosures. Intuit has denied any wrongdoing and appealed the FTC's decision.\n\nFile with TurboTax\n\nReady to file your taxes?

            "content": "Milwaukee forward Giannis Antetokounmpo will not play in next weekend\u2019s All-Star Game because of a strained left calf, meaning NBA Commissioner Adam Silver will have to pick a replacement.\n\nBucks coach Doc Rivers confirmed Antetokounmpo\u2019s status Sunday, with the team ruling him out of a game against Philadelphia and indicating that he\u2019ll likely also be out for games Monday at home against Golden State and Wednesday at Minnesota.\n\nREAD:\n\nNBA: Cavs add Hunter, Nurkic to Hornets at trade deadline\n\nNBA: Disgruntled star Butler sent by Heat to Warriors \u2014 reports\n\nNBA: Bogdan Bogdanovic expects to make Clippers\u2019 debut vs Grizzlies\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just been monitoring it, and it just hasn\u2019t improved enough for us to play him,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cIf this was a playoff game, would he play? Probably yes. But this is not. And we want to make sure he\u2019s playing in the playoffs.\u201d\n\nLeft calf strain\n\nAntetokounmpo missed Milwaukee\u2019s one-round appearance in last season\u2019s playoffs with a left calf strain. The Bucks lost to Indiana in six games.\n\nAntetokounmpo last played Feb. 2 in the Bucks\u2019 123-119 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. He was listed as unavailable due to right patella tendinopathy for the Bucks\u2019 125-96 loss at Oklahoma City the following night, and he\u2019s been out with the calf issue ever since.\n\nHe missed a 112-102 victory at Charlotte on Wednesday and a 115-110 loss at Atlanta on Friday. He went through warmups in Charlotte, but was scratched just before the game.\n\nAntetokounmpo was the leader in fan votes for the All-Star Game, which will be played in San Francisco on Feb. 16 with a new mini-tournament format.\n\nAntetokounmpo was to play on Team Chuck, the eight-man squad drafted last week by TNT analyst Charles Barkley. Antetokounmpo was the fourth of the 24 players drafted by Barkley, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kenny Smith to the All-Star rosters.\n\nTeam Chuck\n\nTeam Chuck has a roster with a very international feel: Nikola Jokic of Serbia, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of Canada, Victor Wembanyama of France, Pascal Siakam of Cameroon, Alperen Sengun of Turkey, Karl-Anthony Towns (whose mother is Dominican) and Donovan Mitchell (whose mother is from Panama).\n\nIt is possible that Silver may have to make another decision on an All-Star replacement in the coming days as well. Dallas forward Anthony Davis \u2014 newly acquired from the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 left his Mavericks debut on Saturday after feeling what he described as tightness in his groin and quadriceps area.\n\nDavis has also been dealing with an abdominal strain, one that kept him out of his final two games with the Lakers before the trade and the first two he could have played with the Mavs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThe 30-year-old Antetokounmpo ranks second in the NBA in scoring (31.8) and fifth in rebounding (12.2) per game. Rivers is hoping Antetokounmpo can play when the Bucks get to post-All-Star matchups on Feb. 20.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really hoping that when we come out of the break, we have our team,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hope.\u201d\n\nYour subscription could not be saved.

            "content": "The NFL world caught LeBron James lacking and they don\u2019t seem to take it lightly. Tonight, there\u2019s literally no noise around the NBA world, as the Super Bowl has taken over the sporting world. The Philadelphia Eagles have come into the showdown strong and the defending champions\u2019 dream to produce the first-ever three-peat in the SB era went into shambles. Amid this situation, the Lakers superstar had the chance to take a bit of credit for the Philly side\u2019s unexpected run. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\n\nY\u2019all remember when the Lakers visited Philadelphia to take on the 76ers and suffered a humiliating defeat. It was right after the Eagles decimated the Washington Commanders in the Conference Finals. Riding on championship spirits, the Philly players took over the court ahead of the tip-off, witnessing Bron\u2019s shoot-around.\n\nRecognizing the players, the 4x Champ went on to greet some of them. He dapped up with AJ Brown & DeVonta Smith and also acknowledged Darius Slay. Unfortunately, he missed out on acknowledging the 22-year-old star, Cooper DeJean. Realizing his mistake, Bron issued an explanation via IG, writing, \u201cI have previous relationships with the other guys! Wasn\u2019t a snub at all. Cooper, you\u2019re a stud brother, and best of luck in the Super Bowl! Go be great.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nFast forward to tonight, it was the rookie, who stole the night, intercepting Patrick Mahomes and scoring on a pick-six. That was it. Fans were all over it and James paid the price. Even the explanation couldn\u2019t save him.\n\nNFL world tracks down LeBron James after the Cooper DeJean Super Bowl takeover\n\nIf LeBron James was facing any backlash, it\u2019s quite easier to spot Skip Bayless in and around the spot. He\u2019s a professional King James hater and tonight, he didn\u2019t miss out on the opportunity. The veteran analyst took to his X handle and dropped a post in all caps, writing, \u201cHEY, LEBRON, THAT GUY WHO JUST PICK SIXED MAHOMES \u2026 HIS NAME IS COOPER DEJEAN. MAYBE HE DOESN\u2019T LOOK LIKE HE CAN PLAY CORNERBACK IN THE NFL, BUT HE\u2019S ON HIS WAY TO BEING A STAR OF A STUD! 17-0 FLY, EAGLES, FLY.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s a post that won\u2019t miss anyone\u2019s attention. Following Bayless, some of the fans were eager to rub it on the superstar\u2019s face. The short video clip of James\u2019 interaction with the Eagles player after the 76ers game was proof that the 4x MVP was rooting for the team. He met the crew on his way to the parking lot, clicked pictures with everyone, and even dropped a piece of advice, which was \u201cNo turnovers.\u201d It could have probably played a role in their W.\n\nDespite this wholesome gesture, some still cling to the Cooper Dejean snub. A fan wrote, \u201cLeBron probably regrets not dapping up Cooper DeJean now.\u201d Of course, he would. James expressed his regret right after DeJean spoke about the snub at a presser. On the other hand, this fan wrote, \u201cLeBron James definitely knows who Cooper DeJean is now.\u201d While it\u2019s an impressive way to get back at the Lakers forward, he clearly mentioned that he didn\u2019t dap him on purpose and even called the rookie a \u201cstud\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nAt the same time, some fans came to the rescue of the NBA legend, arguing that James didn\u2019t notice the 22-year-old at the courtside. A fan wrote, \u201cYou think LeBron James noticed Cooper DeJean there?\u201d Well, it\u2019s hard to say with the video available on the internet. DeJean was standing next to teammates, and he failed to catch Bron\u2019s attention. Moreover, according to a fan, it was a blessing in disguise, as they decoded the DeJean\u2019s performance, writing, \u201cThank you LeBron James for igniting a fire in Cooper Dejean and the Fellas.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nWhile the fans were behind James, DeJean himself responded to the dapping incident at the press. He said, \u201cI\u2019m a LeBron fan so it\u2019s tough. I didn\u2019t really expect him to know who I was or say hi to me so it\u2019s all good .\u201d Now that the Eagles have breached the Chiefs\u2019 fortress, fans might forget Bron\u2019s lapse.

            "content": "Let's talk about the popular Intuit Inc. ( ). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$706 and falling to the lows of US$579. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Intuit's current trading price of US$579 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Intuit\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nWhat Is Intuit Worth?\n\nGood news, investors! Intuit is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $892.81, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Intuit\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat does the future of Intuit look like?\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 80% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Intuit. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since INTU is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on INTU for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy INTU. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.\n\nKeep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

Here, Billboard honors 28 of the world\u2019s best venues, classified by region, capacity and other attributes such as food and beverage and \u201cwow factor.\u201d The list was determined by Billboard\u2019s reporting and editorial staff. Gross and attendance figures span from Oct. 1, 2023, to Sept. 30, 2024, as reported by Billboard Boxscore.\n\nTop West Coast Stadium: Allegiant Stadium (Las Vegas)\n\n65,000 capacity\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nOpened in 2020 near the Las Vegas Strip, the $1.9 billion Allegiant Stadium is a visual and technological marvel with its sleek black glass facade, retractable lanai doors and translucent UV-resistant roof that offers a first of its kind climate-controlled environment.

It has hosted concerts by The Rolling Stones, The Who and, in 1977, the famed \u201cSuper Bowl of Rock\u201d that featured Ted Nugent, Lynyrd Skynyrd, REO Speedwagon, Journey and .38 Special. In the last year, Soldier Field brought in over $80 million across eight performances, according to Boxscore.\n\nTop East Coast Stadium: MetLife Stadium (East Rutherford, N.J.)\n\n82,000 capacity\n\nThere\u2019s nothing bigger in the New York market than MetLife Stadium, home to two NFL teams \u2014 the New York Jets and the New York Giants \u2014 as well as some of the region\u2019s biggest concerts. Opened in 2010, MetLife is known for its striking exterior facade of aluminum louvers that change colors to represent the home team, as well as the 50,000-square-foot Great Hall pre-event gathering space, cutting-edge video boards and fully immersive audio systems that ensure every performance \u2014 including 2023 shows from Bruce Springsteen, and P!nk and The Rolling Stones last year \u2014 is top-notch.

Mexico\u2019s biggest stadium has a functional design and open-air structure that blends seamlessly into the sprawling Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City complex surrounding it. GNP Seguros offers unobstructed sightlines for both general admission and premium seating areas, as well as expertly designed acoustics for legendary artists like Paul McCartney, Metallica, Luis Miguel, The Killers and Bruno Mars, who all graced its stage last year after it reopened under the GNP Seguros banner in August. Since its opening in 1993, the venue has also been home to the Formula 1 Mexican Grand Prix and Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez circuit.\n\nTop U.S. Festival Site: Double JJ Resort (Rothbury, Mich.)\n\n50,000 capacity\n\nThe sprawling landscape and rustic charm of Double JJ Resort are ideal for Electric Forest festival, held annually at the nearly 90-year-old site.

Each exterior piece is made of a unique chemical formula, tailored to draw upon Southern California\u2019s year-round climate for natural heating and cooling. The dome hosted 20 concerts before the Clippers even started their 2024-25 season and is already set for performances from Rod Wave, Mary J. Blige, Los Tucanes de Tijuana and Keith Urban this year.\n\nTop Central U.S. Arena: United Center (Chicago)\n\n23,500 capacity\n\nNicknamed \u201cThe House That Jordan Built,\u201d United Center is best known for the accomplishments of NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan. Opened in 1993, the arena is a Midwestern powerhouse, famous for its sleek facade and the commanding presence of its massive arches. Still home to the Chicago Bulls, United Center hosted more than 50 non-NBA events in the past year, placing the arena at No. 8 on Boxscore\u2019s 2024 Year-End Top 50 Venues (15,000-plus capacity) chart with $123.8 million grossed.\n\nTop East Coast Arena: Madison Square Garden (New York)\n\n19,500 capacity\n\nThe world\u2019s most famous arena has long dominated North America as the top-grossing arena on the continent, attracting millions of music and sports fans each year to Midtown Manhattan. While the Garden has been relocated and renovated throughout the decades, its power and allure will always draw from its location at the center of the country\u2019s largest media market. According to Boxscore\u2019s 2024 year-end data, MSG sold 2 million tickets across 145 shows and grossed nearly $300 million, as it welcomed some of the biggest tours of the year, including Madonna, Nicki Minaj, Olivia Rodrigo, Aventura, Pearl Jam, Charli xcx and Troye Sivan, Sabrina Carpenter and Billie Eilish, while Billy Joel concluded his decadelong residency in July.\n\nTop Canadian Arena: Scotiabank Arena (Toronto)\n\n19,800 capacity\n\nLocated in the heart of Canada\u2019s most populous city, Scotiabank Arena has been an integral part of Toronto\u2019s cityscape since its 1999 opening. Despite having two tenant sports teams (the NBA\u2019s Toronto Raptors and the NHL\u2019s Toronto Maple Leafs), the arena still held more than 75 shows \u2014 drawing over 1 million fans and grossing $120 million in ticket sales \u2014 during its 25th-anniversary year, which helped it rank as the highest-grossing Canadian arena on Boxscore\u2019s 2024 Year-End Top 50 Venues (15,000-plus capacity) chart. As it prepares for the next quarter-century, Scotiabank Arena is undergoing a $350 million \u201creimagination project\u201d that is expected to conclude this summer.\n\nTop Caribbean Arena: Coliseo de Puerto Rico (San Juan)\n\n18,500 capacity\n\nThe Coliseo de Puerto Rico Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot, commonly known as the Coliseo de Puerto Rico, has been bringing music to the U.S. territory since 2004 while also developing the next generation of reggaet\u00f3n, Latin and salsa stars. In 2024, the arena hosted events with Eladio Carri\u00f3n, Bad Bunny, Car\u00edn Le\u00f3n, Feid, Ana Gabriel, Camila, Jerry Rivera and Luis Miguel \u2014 whose latest world tour made history as the highest-grossing Latin outing in Boxscore history ($330 million). But the landmark venue also provides a stage for acts beyond Latin genres and welcomed artists including Culture Club, Louis Tomlinson, Evanescence and Travis Scott in 2024.\n\nLuis Miguel at Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan in 2024.

The government-owned, AEG-managed arena held the No. 3 position in 2024 (behind Sphere and Madison Square Garden) in large part thanks to the United Kingdom\u2019s demand for concerts and London\u2019s own reputation as a hub for European travel. Originally built as the Millennium Dome in 2000, the structure was turned into a multipurpose site, retaining its iconic design while integrating cutting-edge sound and lighting systems to further enhance top-tier live shows.\n\nTop West Coast Amphitheater: The Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)\n\n5,900 capacity\n\nSituated inside Los Angeles\u2019 scenic Griffith Park, this storied outdoor venue features a striking blend of classical architecture \u2014 including columns inspired by ancient Greek amphitheaters \u2014 and abundant greenery. Owned by the city of Los Angeles and managed by Legends Hospitality, the Greek is open to promoters of all backgrounds and offers an iconic stage for acts that have graduated from clubs and are on their way to selling out arenas. The amphitheater offers curated, high-end culinary options, while fans can take in more than 95 years of live-music history that includes performances from Frank Sinatra and Fleetwood Mac and contemporary acts like Billie Eilish and Harry Styles.\n\nTop Central U.S. Amphitheater: Red Rocks (Morrison, Colo.)\n\n9,600 capacity\n\nRed Rocks is the ultimate aspirational venue \u2014 countless artists hope to play the idyllic amphitheater inside Red Rocks Park, a National Historic Landmark, and every fan wants to watch their favorite act while surrounded by the beautifully lit red sandstone outcrops. Opened in 1941, Red Rocks is uniquely carved into the Rocky Mountain landscape, surrounded by towering sandstone monoliths that frame the stage and provide near-perfect acoustics. Lucky for both artists and fans, the iconic venue \u2014 owned and operated by the city of Denver \u2014 has continued to extend its season each year, hosting 199 shows in 2024. With 1.6 million tickets sold, Red Rocks was the highest-grossing outdoor venue with a capacity of 5,000 to 10,000 in 2024, according to Boxscore\u2019s year-end chart.\n\nTop East Coast Amphitheater: Forest Hills Stadium (Queens)\n\n14,000 capacity\n\nForest Hills Stadium, an iconic, Tudor-style venue originally built in 1923 as part of the West Side Tennis Club, has hosted legends including Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand and The Beatles (for their very first stadium gigs) after opening up for concerts in the 1960s. Harmonizing with the surrounding neighborhood\u2019s charm, the venue with unparalleled sightlines has an intimate atmosphere that makes concerts feel personal for fans. The stadium sat in disuse for decades before promoter Mike Luba helped reopen it in 2013 and has since had performances from the likes of Mumford & Sons, Ed Sheeran and Hozier, who marked a record four-night run of sellouts last June.\n\nTop West Coast Club Or Theater: YouTube Theater (Los Angeles)\n\n6,000 capacity\n\nOpened in 2021 as part of the SoFi Stadium and Hollywood Park complex, YouTube Theater is both a physical and symbolic steppingstone into the entertainment campus.

With over 340,000 tickets sold for a gross of $31.2 million during the 2023-24 chart year, YouTube Theater has managed to thrive in the competitive L.A. market.\n\nTop Central U.S. Club Or Theater: Ryman Auditorium (Nashville)\n\n2,300 capacity\n\nAffectionately known as \u201cThe Mother Church of Country Music,\u201d the Ryman has been a revered venue since first opening in 1892 as a tabernacle church by Confederate Civil War veterans. Inspired by the Romanesque Revival architectural movement, the Ryman stands out thanks to its unique accents \u2014 it features red brick walls, arched windows with stained glass and a distinctive gabled roof. It was formerly the home of the Grand Ole Opry (which moved to a larger venue in 1974) but was left vacant until reopening in 1994 for a new generation of music fans to sit along the restored pews and enjoy performances by artists from Neil Young to Wu-Tang Clan.\n\nTop East Coast Club Or Theater: Brooklyn Paramount (Brooklyn)\n\n2,700 capacity\n\nWhen the Brooklyn Paramount originally opened in 1928, it was called \u201cAmerica\u2019s first movie theater built for sound\u201d and, as it moved through the decades, it welcomed big band jazz, hosted Alan Freed\u2019s rock\u2019n\u2019roll revues and even became a lavish basketball court for Long Island University. Live Nation reopened the renovated theater in March 2024 with inspiration from its 1920s heyday. Stepping into the building is like walking into a time machine, with its intricate stone carvings, Art Deco flair and a marquee that evokes old-school charm. Since March, the venue has welcomed artists from Norah Jones and Jack White to PinkPantheress and Anitta.\n\nTop Residency Venue: The Colosseum At Caesars Palace (Las Vegas)\n\n4,100 capacity\n\nOriginally built for megastar C\u00e9line Dion, The Colosseum at Caesars Palace has become a pinnacle of Las Vegas glamour and a concert residency jewel. The venue\u2019s exterior is an elaborate homage to ancient Roman architecture, while its interior features plush seats, flawless sound and VIP packages that elevate the fan experience. Since its opening in 2003, The Colosseum has hosted residencies by artists including Elton John, Cher, Shania Twain, Mariah Carey, Usher, Garth Brooks and Adele, whose two-year, 100-show Weekends With Adele residency at the venue wrapped in November 2024. The iconic venue boasted nine entries on Billboard\u2019s list of the 25 Biggest Concert Residencies of All Time.\n\nWow Factor: Sphere (Las Vegas)\n\n17,600 capacity\n\nSphere isn\u2019t just a venue \u2014 it\u2019s a jaw-dropping glimpse into the future of live entertainment. Launching in late 2023 with a 40-show U2 residency, which was followed by runs by Phish, Dead & Company and the Eagles, the stars of each show are Sphere\u2019s state-of-the-art 240-foot-tall video screen inside the 366-foot-tall venue and the building-size video \u201cExosphere\u201d that cloaks the venue and illuminates the desert sky. The one-of-a-kind experience also features haptic seats, sensor controls and a spatial audio system. With just 77 shows, Sphere topped Boxscore\u2019s 2024 Year-End Top 50 Venues chart (15,000-plus capacity) with more than $420 million grossed and 1.3 million tickets sold.\n\nTop Bucket List Venue: Billy Bob\u2019s (Fort Worth, Texas)\n\n6,000 capacity\n\nWhen it comes to live music with a Texas-size dose of character, Billy Bob\u2019s in Fort Worth stands tall as a honky-tonk haven. Located in the historic Fort Worth Stockyards, Billy Bob\u2019s was formerly an open-air barn used to house prize cattle for the Fort Worth Stock Show before they added the tower at its entrance adorned with a giant neon sign depicting the shape of the venue\u2019s home state. The Lone Star site is decorated with hundreds of neon signs and 75 guitars autographed by the artists who have played there, and it features a full-blown rodeo arena with live bull riding. Add killer barbecue and cold beer, and you\u2019ve got the ultimate night out in the heart of Texas.\n\nBilly Bob\u2019s Texas in Fort Worth, Texas. Robert Gallagher\n\nBest Concept: The Salt Shed (Chicago)\n\n5,000 capacity\n\nThis industrial-chic venue, housed in a repurposed Morton Salt warehouse along the Chicago River, makes a bold first impression to newcomers. Its iconic rooftop sign \u2014 the same as the label from the Morton Salt in your kitchen cabinet \u2014 has been preserved, along with the industrial bones of the warehouse updated with expansive glass walls and riverside patios. The Salt Shed complex includes three spaces: the 3,600-capacity indoor shed, the 5,000-capacity outdoor fairgrounds and the Three Top Lounge, which sits at the highest point of the building and offers craft cocktails and specialty food. Since opening in 2022, the Salt Shed has hosted everyone from indie darlings Fleet Foxes to genre-bending stars like Andr\u00e9 3000.\n\nLocal Favorite, West: Belly Up (Solana Beach, Calif.)\n\n600 capacity\n\nAt first glance, Belly Up looks like a run-of-the-mill dive bar, which it was for many years before 1976, when owners Dave Hodges and Greg Gilholm made it into the live-music venue it is today. Belly Up focused mainly on rock\u2019n\u2019roll and blues in its early years, welcoming stars like Etta James, Big Mama Thorton and Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins to its tiny stage. Since then, the small concert hall has hosted performances from Jimmy Buffett, George Clinton, Willie Nelson, Mumford & Sons, Mick Fleetwood and Jack Johnson, among many others. What continues to make the venue special after 50 years is the local Southern California talent that has come through, including Maroon 5, No Doubt, Snoop Dogg, Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Black Eyed Peas.\n\nLocal Favorite, Southwest: Empire Control Room & Garage (Austin)\n\n1,050 capacity\n\nThe Empire Control Room & Garage is the embodiment of Austin\u2019s \u201cLive Music Capital of the World\u201d ethos, carefully blending culture and community each night into an unforgettable experience for fans and artists alike. The three-stage venue \u2014 the 1,050-capacity Empire Garage, 350-capacity Control Room and 200-capacity, creekside outdoor patio \u2014 is situated in Austin\u2019s Red River cultural district, which boasts one of the few remaining contiguous blocks of live-music venues in the United States. Painted predominantly in black, the outside of Empire rocks an edgy aesthetic, setting the tone for what\u2019s inside: a dynamic, distraction-free live-music venue with immersive lighting and a sound system that punches way above its weight.\n\nKeeping It Indie: 9:30 Club (Washington, D.C.)\n\n1,200 capacity\n\nThe 9:30 Club isn\u2019t just a music venue \u2014 it\u2019s a cultural institution. Since opening in 1980, this standing-room-only rock haven exudes cool, beginning with its industrial brick facade and gritty, yet charming interior where every space comes with an incredible view of the stage. Originally located at 930 F St. (hence the name), the venue has thrived since moving in 1996. The iconic club has not only lasted for decades in the D.C. market but also has remained staunchly independent. For the 2024 year-end Boxscore charts, 9:30 Club reported hosting over 260 events with performances from Fontaines D.C., Royel Otis, Shaboozey and Jack White.\n\nBest Food And Music Pairing: Brooklyn Bowl (Brooklyn)\n\n900 capacity\n\nThe headliners may change each night, but the menu at Brooklyn Bowl has remained consistent for over a decade. The Blue Ribbon fried chicken remains a standout on the elevated food and beverage menu that graces all four Brooklyn Bowl locations across the country (Brooklyn, Las Vegas, Nashville and Philadelphia). Long considered the greatest meal on New York\u2019s rock\u2019n\u2019roll scene, the secret to the famed recipe is all about the batter. Each dish includes a specially sourced gluten-free matzo that\u2019s regularly flown in from Israel, giving each bite that perfectly crispy, impossibly savory taste. Paired with an ice-cold Brooklyn Brewery lager and a heap of sauerkraut mashed potatoes, there is no tastier match in music, either front of house or backstage.\n\nMost Unforgettable Experience: Cain\u2019s Ballroom (Tulsa, Okla.)\n\n1,800 capacity\n\nOn their 2007 track \u201cEaston & Main,\u201d Oklahoma natives Turnpike Troubadours give a shoutout to their local music venue by stating they left their heart \u201con the Cain\u2019s Ballroom floor soaking up a bourbon stain.\u201d Country and Americana stars have lots of love for the 1920s dance hall that has hosted sets from Hank Williams and \u201cKing of Western Swing\u201d Bob Willis, whose regular appearances at the venue helped it earn the moniker \u201cthe Carnegie Hall of Western Swing.\u201d The room \u2014 which features a spring-loaded dancefloor, a 4-foot neon star and a silver disco ball lighting up the log cabin \u2014 still welcomes greats, with recent performances from Charley Crockett, Wilco and Chappell Roan.\n\nMost Environmentally Friendly: Acrisure Arena (Palm Springs, Calif.)\n\n11,000 capacity\n\nAcrisure Arena is a climate-friendly oasis in the heart of the California desert. Built with sustainability in mind, the venue is surrounded by drought-resistant plants and sunk 25 feet below grade to limit exposure of its exterior facade to reduce dependence on its HVAC system. It gathers energy from solar panels covering its parking lot, where electric vehicles are prioritized, and sources food and beverage options from local, sustainable vendors to reduce emissions from travel. Located just hours outside of the Los Angeles metro area, Acrisure Arena grossed over $40 million in the last year, attracting top-tier talent including Madonna, Olivia Rodrigo, Stevie Nicks and Fuerza Regida.\n\nThis story appears in the Feb. 8, 2025, issue of Billboard.",

            "content": "According to 2024 data from the Pew Research Center, over half of Americans (53%) say they are very bothered by the complexity of the American tax system. And, in their defense, there\u2019s a lot to be bothered by: the Internal Revenue Code now fills no fewer than 4,192 pages. Little wonder that every April, 79% of us find ourselves trudging off to the tax preparer\u2014usually a chain like H&R Block, Liberty Tax Service, or Jackson Hewitt.\n\nBut it turns out that many Americans are bothered by the complexity of those places, too\u2014at least if TurboTax\u2019s 2025 Super Bowl spot is any indication. The spot will run in the first half of the second quarter.\n\nIssa Rae is the taxpayers\u2019 proxy in this 45-second ad from R/GA, titled \u201cNow Taxes is So Sweet.\u201d Keep your eye peeled for metaphors, everybody. We see Rae speeding down the expressway in her SUV\u2014in reverse\u2014late for her appointment at the storefront tax prep joint. Joining her in the parking lot is a Night of the Living Dead-style cast of glassy-eyed clods, staggering forth carrying cardboard boxes erupting with paper receipts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 2025\u2014this is taxes?\u201d Rae asks rhetorically.\n\nNext, Rae climbs a dizzying stretch of stairs (symbolizing needless steps) only to find the tax office closed.\n\nIt looks like a complete nightmare\u2014and in fact, it is. Rae was only dreaming the first 27 seconds of the spot and, fortunately for her, her actual tax experience then takes the real-life form of a friendly accountant named Doug on her smartphone screen, speaking the reassuring words: \u201cIssa, I\u2019ve got all your forms. I\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d\n\nIn other words, her 2025 taxes are all filed and finished.\n\n\u201cWe know that consumers struggle with the tax process, and we wanted them to know we hear them and see them in our dramatized version of the tax filing experience with headwinds literally in their face,\u201d said Trevor Kelley, marketing VP at TurboTax\u2019s Consumer Group.\n\nOne suspects that nothing in life is really this easy and, in fairness, what\u2019s on display here is TurboTax Live, a higher-tier package that lets customers talk to a real-life tax preparer. But customers seem to like the human touch, since Live\u2019s revenue grew by 17% in 2024, beating the 13% year-over-year growth that parent company Intuit posted. The financial technology giant pulled in $16.3 billion last year. There\u2019s a lot of money to be made off taxpayer misery.",

We played hard and competed with a team that plays fast and usually puts up a lot of numbers, a lot of points. And so, you can take this one but still got to learn from it and be better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIvica Zubac had a double-double with 18 points and 15 rebounds and James Harden had 22 points, 10 assists and six rebounds.\n\nBut 19 turnovers coupled with their inability to stop guard Tyrese Haliburton doomed the Clippers. Haliburton scored nine of his 14 points in the fourth quarter. He had two steals in the fourth and was three for five from the field. In addition, Pascal Siakam torched the Clippers for 33 points and 11 rebounds.\n\n\u201cWe just got to take care of the ball, really,\u201d said Leonard, who had five turnovers. \u201cThe next guy got to be ready to be available, and just better passes, really.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey are a fast-paced team. They did a great job causing turnovers, picking up full court and getting us uncomfortable. So, you got to give them credit.\u201d\n\nBefore the game, the Clippers (28-23) traded fan favorite Terance Mann and guard Bones Hyland to the Atlanta Hawks for guard Bogdan Bogdanovic and three second-round draft picks. They also traded reserve guard Kevin Porter Jr. to the Milwaukee Bucks for young wing MarJon Beauchamp.\n\nThe Clippers have been one of the best defensive teams in the NBA, ranking third in points given up (107.5), second in defensive rating (108.2) and second in steals (10.2). Still, they knew their defense would be pushed by the Pacers.\n\nThe Pacers came to L.A. ranked 10th in scoring (107.5), fourth in field-goal percentage (49.1%) and ninth in three-point shooting (36.9%).\n\nThe Clippers started strong, holding the Pacers to 22 points on 27.6% shooting in the first quarter while scoring 42 points.\n\nIndiana center Myles Turner took a forearm to the face and had to be helped back to the locker room with 6:13 left in the quarter. He later was ruled out for a concussion evaluation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the Pacers (29-21) rallied, taking a 64-61 lead at halftime by outscoring the Clippers 42-19 in the second quarter.\n\nThe Clippers battled back and led 105-100 before Siakam and Haliburton hit back-to-back threes to start a 14-0 run.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mind tonight\u2019s game,\u201d Lue said. \u201cYou are not going to win every game, but some things we can learn. Just taking care of the basketball. So, we had the lead, a big lead, turn the ball over, turn the ball over, turn the ball over. They got back in the game. Take the lead in the fourth quarter after clawing back, playing great defense, good offense and then we got a turnover at half court and they get a dunk and we come back the next play and the same thing.\u201d",

            "content": "At Intuit, our mission is clear: to power prosperity around the world and to help customers and communities overcome their most pressing financial challenges. For us, helping our customers succeed is personal. Whether managing personal finances, filing taxes, or growing a business, each interaction is an opportunity to fuel the prosperity of our customers through a deep understanding of their data and their individual needs.\n\nThis is particularly true for the small businesses we support. These businesses are the lifeblood of local communities and the economic engines of nations, yet more than half don\u2019t survive beyond their fifth year.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re dedicated to evening the odds for small business owners with artificial intelligence (AI) by unlocking the power of their data\u2014which has long been a game-changer for large corporations.\n\nAI: a game-changer for small businesses\n\nAI can provide critical, personalized, data-driven insights, helping small business owners quickly assess their financial health, secure loans, or plan expansions. QuickBooks Cash Flow Planner, for instance, uses cutting-edge AI forecasting to make timely cash flow predictions and identify key patterns. These insights give small businesses the visibility they need to make informed financial decisions, including where and how to invest their limited resources.\n\nIn Mailchimp, we\u2019re using AI to help businesses generate relevant marketing at scale. With just a few clicks, our AI tools can draft custom emails, adjust the tone, text, and images, and even optimize campaigns. And all along the way, the customer is in control of the experience \u2013 free to accept, reject, or modify any campaign suggestion until it is just right. This not only creates personalized experiences but also boosts revenue, with some businesses seeing a 60% increase in engagement when these features are used.\n\nAccording to our 2025 Small Business Index Annual Report, small businesses using AI and digital tools are nearly twice as likely to report revenue growth, and more than two-thirds see significant productivity gains. When you combine that tooling with relevant, impactful uses of their data, you strengthen their chances for success.\n\nDriving innovation with trust and confidence\n\nSmall businesses and their customers expect products and services that understand and anticipate their needs. 88% of small business marketers say customer expectations are at an all-time high, yet roughly 70% lack data-driven recommendations to improve performance. The race to deliver personalized experiences must not come at the cost of trust.\n\nAs stewards of our customers\u2019 data, we see strong privacy and data protections as an essential part of our value proposition, not just a compliance requirement. Our customers need to know their data is used responsibly and ethically, so they can make decisions with complete confidence.\n\nOur commitment to privacy and data stewardship\n\nThis belief fuels our company\u2019s culture and drives every aspect of our product development processes and procedures:\n\nPrivacy by Design \u2013 we integrate privacy into our system development lifecycle, design policies, and business practices, ensuring data protection is integral to our AI solutions.\n\nTransparency \u2013 we continually work to build trust with our customers by explaining how we use data in our products and services, including clear explanations of our AI-powered features.\n\nCustomer Empowerment \u2013 we equip individuals with the tools and resources to empower them to make well-informed choices regarding the use of their data.\n\nResponsible AI \u2013 we follow a thoughtful, accountable approach to ensure the responsible use of AI across our platform.\n\nWhy privacy matters more than ever\n\nConsumers are becoming more aware of the value of their personal information and are more selective about who they trust. This shift is driven by a desire for oversight, transparency, and security. The global regulatory landscape is also evolving rapidly, with new laws setting standards for data protection in the age of AI.\n\nAt Intuit, we know it is a privilege to be entrusted with our customers\u2019 data, and we work every day to create the most impactful, innovative, done-for-you experiences across our platform. Our strong commitment to data privacy, security, and responsible AI governance is essential to this mission. When companies prioritize privacy and the care of their customer data, they open the door to amazing, relevant customer experiences that power success.\n\nFor that reason, we use industry-leading technology and practices to safeguard customer data and protect privacy, adhering to responsible AI principles that guide our operations and scaling efforts.\n\nDriving data stewardship and responsible innovation\n\nAs Intuit\u2019s Chief Privacy Officer, it\u2019s my honor to lead a cross-organizational team where data stewardship, privacy, and security are fundamental to our values. This ensures that our innovations not only improve the financial lives of everyone\u2014from the small business on Main Street to the online entrepreneur\u2014but do so with the highest standards of trust and integrity.\n\nInnovation is crucial, and it is accelerated by a commitment to privacy and security. When developers have clear guidelines and safeguards, they can focus on creating delightful and impactful experiences without compromise.\n\nAt Intuit, we believe that innovation and privacy go hand in hand. By embedding strong data protections and ethical AI practices, we\u2019re not just building better products; we\u2019re building a better future for our customers and communities.",

            "content": "Intuit Dome realized owner Steve Ballmer's vision for the NBA Los Angeles Clippers to play in an iconic venue within a complex that houses all team functions under a single roof. The 18,000-seat arena is the NBA's most environmentally friendly arena and benefits the Inglewood community year-round. The venue anchors a 1.14 million-square-foot facility including state-of-the-art practice and training facilities, team offices, fan gathering spaces, and indoor and outdoor basketball courts open to the public. The distinctive diagrid shell roof, covered in diamond-shaped ETFE and PTFE fabric panels, is designed to resemble a basketball net, making Intuit Dome stand out from other NBA arenas.\n\nWalter P Moore's team of structural, enclosure, seismic, and construction engineering specialists blended their expertise to optimize the roof geometry, connections, and panel layouts to achieve the goals of strength, beauty, and practicality. Seismic safety was a concern because the site is 1.25 miles from the Newport-Inglewood Fault.\n\nThe team created an elegant and ingenious solution that allows the light diagrid shell to behave independently from the much stiffer main arena structure that supports it during a seismic event. They connected the diagrid shell to the arena roof at its top and then laterally supported it at node points down its height with innovative toggle-brace connections. The toggle-braces provide lateral and gravity support while allowing the shell to \"swish like a hula skirt\" around the more rigid brace frame structure. Intuit Dome also features an enormous one-of-a-kind \"Halo\" board, a one-million pound, 360-degree, double-sided video board with retractable end pieces that are suspended from the roof, along with state-of-the-art rigging and catwalk systems that enhance the venue's capabilities.\n\nIntuit Dome is a fully electric facility with sufficient solar panels and batteries to power the arena for an entire concert or basketball game. It is the first NBA arena to achieve LEED Platinum certification under LEED v4. Walter P Moore reduced embodied carbon in the concrete by over 20 percent by collaborating with the concrete supplier to obtain supply-chain-specific Environmental Produce Declarations for all concrete mixes; as a result, the concrete is 50 percent more energy efficient than required by the California Green Building Code.\n\nThe complex opened on budget and three months ahead of schedule in July 2024.\n\nCongratulations, Walter P Moore, for capturing ACEC California's 2025 Golden State Award!\n\nPhotographs of all Engineering Excellence Award-winning projects can be found at: 2025 Engineering Excellence Award Winners - American Council of Engineering Companies of California\n\nAbout Walter P Moore\n\nWalter P Moore is an international company of engineers, innovators, and creative people who solve some of the world's most complex structural and infrastructure challenges.

The stock also fell short of the S&P 500\u2019s 16% gain during that period.\n\nIs now the time to buy INTU? Find out in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhy Does Intuit Spark Debate?\n\nCreated in 1983 when founder Scott Cook watched his wife struggle to reconcile the family's checkbook, Intuit provides tax and accounting software for small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nTwo Things to Like:\n\n1. Customer Acquisition Costs Are Recovered in Record Time\n\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period measures the months a company needs to recoup the money spent on acquiring a new customer. This metric helps assess how quickly a business can break even on its sales and marketing investments.\n\nIntuit is extremely efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 12.7 months this quarter. The company\u2019s rapid recovery of its customer acquisition costs indicates it has a highly differentiated product offering and a strong brand reputation due to its scale. These dynamics give Intuit more resources to pursue new product initiatives while maintaining the flexibility to increase its sales and marketing investments.\n\n2. Excellent Free Cash Flow Margin Boosts Reinvestment Potential\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\n\nIntuit has shown terrific cash profitability, driven by its lucrative business model and cost-effective customer acquisition strategy that enable it to stay ahead of the competition through investments in new products rather than sales and marketing. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin was among the best in the software sector, averaging an eye-popping 31% over the last year.\n\nOne Reason to be Careful:\n\nLong-Term Revenue Growth Disappoints\n\nA company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Over the last three years, Intuit grew its sales at a 17.2% annual rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell slightly short of our benchmark for the software sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds. Luckily, there are other things to like about Intuit.\n\nFinal Judgment\n\nIntuit has huge potential even though it has some open questions. With its shares trailing the market in recent months, the stock trades at 8.9\u00d7 forward price-to-sales (or $589.99 per share). Is now the right time to buy? See for yourself in our full research report, it\u2019s free.\n\nStocks We Like Even More Than Intuit\n\nWith rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.\n\nPut yourself in the driver\u2019s seat by checking out our Top 5 Growth Stocks for this month. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\n\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,183% between December 2019 and December 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like Comfort Systems (+751% five-year return).

            "content": "The fact that multiple Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Intuit\n\nIntuit Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP and Chief People & Places Officer, Laura Fennell, for US$5.1m worth of shares, at about US$659 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$592). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.\n\nIn the last year Intuit insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nNasdaqGS:INTU Insider Trading Volume February 5th 2025\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of small cap stocks that are not only being bought by insiders but also have attractive valuations.\n\nIntuit Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Intuit shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$9.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Intuit\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Intuit insiders own 2.4% of the company, worth about US$4.0b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Intuit Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But it is good to see that Intuit is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Intuit.",

(NASDAQ:INTU) stands against other best big tech stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nBig Tech comprises some of the largest and most influential companies in the world, recognized for their sheer size, extensive customer base, and financial strength. Leading this group are five major companies that have been at the forefront of the tech sector economy, driving innovation and shaping consumer behavior. Over the years, Big Tech firms have benefited from the widespread adoption of smartphones and high-speed internet, increased demand for digital services, the rise of social media, strong demand for cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital advertising.\n\nHow Did the Big Tech Companies Become The Giants They are Today?\n\nBeyond technological advancements, these companies have also benefited from several phenomena. The first is network effects\u2014the more users a platform has, the more valuable it becomes. Other contributing factors include economies of scale as they expanded through acquisitions and the ease of scaling digital businesses globally; access to vast amounts of user data used to enhance products, target ads, and create highly personalized services; and their deep pockets (strong balance sheets) that enabled them to invest heavily in R&D, hire top talent, and operate during challenging times. This financial strength also allowed them to aggressively invest in AI and maintain a first-mover advantage. While challenges persist, we believe these companies will continue to innovate, expand their influence, and shape the future of technology.\n\nIn a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Wedbush Securities\u2019 Global Head of Technology Research, Dan Ives, expressed optimism about the future of Big Tech, stating:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s $80 billion investment announcement and then Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement that his company plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence is \u201cthe start of a massive build-out of AI Capex\u201d that I think the Street is massively underestimating. And it\u2019s the multiplier \u2013 every dollar spent on a NVIDIA chip, means $8 to $10 multiplier goes to the rest of tech \u2013 that\u2019s bullish for tech. Of course, with Trump and Stargate, it just shows that fourth industrial revolution is just starting.\u201d\n\nWhile Big Tech typically refers to the top five mega-cap companies, we have prepared an extended list of 15 stocks that have made a significant impact on the tech landscape and are equally innovative and transformative as the top five.",

How Does TurboTax Deal With Self-Employment? Multiple Ways to Enter Expenses Does TurboTax Check Your Return? Is TurboTax Safe to Use? Can You Do Your Taxes on Your Phone With TurboTax? Verdict: TurboTax Is Better Than Ever\n\nIntuit TurboTax has been a heavyweight in the tax preparation category for several decades now and shows no signs of slowing down. It expertly balances substance and style, combining thorough coverage of tax topics with an easy-to-follow interview format and top-notch support. New integrations with Credit Karma and QuickBooks Online (both of which Intuit owns), a reshuffling of the interview process, and a revamp of its wrap-up make the experience better than ever. Its mobile apps are first-class, too. You pay a premium for all these features, but TurboTax easily earns our Editors' Choice award and an outstanding five-star rating\u2014it's that good. FreeTaxUSA isn't as robust, but it's also an Editors' Choice winner because it enables you to file even complex federal returns for free.\n\nHow Much Does TurboTax Cost?\n\nTurboTax costs more than other online tax prep services, but not by much. It maintains a Free Edition* (federal and state) for taxpayers who claim the standard deduction and whose returns don't involve anything beyond the Child Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, limited interest and dividend income, the student loan interest deduction, taxable qualified retirement plan distributions, and W-2 income.\n\nThe Deluxe version ($39 each for federal and state returns) lets you add itemized deductions. The Premium tier ($89 for federal, $39 for state) includes what you need to report rental and investment income and self-employment. The prices for both versions will increase later in the filing season. Through February 28, 2025, you can file federal and state taxes for free (regardless of complexity) if you didn't use TurboTax for the 2023 tax year\u2014as long as you use the TurboTax mobile app this year.\n\nCash App Taxes (formerly Credit Karma Tax) and FreeTaxUSA are free for federal filing, though the latter charges $14.99 for state returns. Neither competes with TurboTax in terms of guidance or user experience, though FreeTaxUSA gets closer. Although TurboTax Premium is expensive, it costs only a few dollars more than H&R Block Self-Employed ($85 for federal, $37 for state).\n\nIf you need help from a human, Intuit offers additional virtual services via chat, phone, and video. As you prepare your return, you can connect to an expert virtually via the Live Assisted service to ask questions and get a final review of your return. You can also have a tax pro handle your entire return from start to finish (that's called TurboTax Live Full Service). You pay more depending on the complexity of your return. H&R Block offers similar services.\n\nHow Does TurboTax Work?\n\nTurboTax originated the wizard-based approach to tax preparation over 30 years ago. It takes you through a lengthy series of pages, one at a time, in a logical order. There\u2019s a home page for every major section that breaks down their many subtopics. It\u2019s very easy to drill down and find the topic you want to visit.\n\nYou answer questions by clicking buttons, entering data, and selecting from options. You can also import data directly from some forms, such as W-2s and 1099s (if your employer or financial institutions are TurboTax Import Partners), or you can type in the data yourself. In some cases, you might be able to upload a form from your computer or snap a picture of it.\n\n(Credit: TurboTax/PCMag)\n\nInvestment transaction imports are especially flexible. You can import up to 10,000 stock trades and 20,000 cryptocurrency transactions from more financial sources than any competitor. TurboTax supports numerous financial institutions (like Coinbase, TD Ameritrade, and Vanguard), so you can import your investment data directly. If your broker or exchange isn\u2019t on the list, you can upload a CSV file or enter the information yourself. The site provides more guidance on cryptocurrency than any other product I tested.\n\nTurboTax alternates between walking you through a Q&A and showing you lists of available topics. After you complete the federal section, it transfers data to any state returns you must file. Then, it helps you e-file or print the finished product. The process works beautifully, saving time, easing frustration, and dramatically reducing errors.\n\nGetting Started With TurboTax\n\nIf you filed your income taxes using TurboTax or another tax prep app last year, you can import key data to save time. If you are new to TurboTax, it will guide you through the entire setup process. It helps you select the correct version first and then requests information such as contact details, dependents, and Social Security numbers. The site then shows a landing page with the income topics you selected and a comprehensive list of other potential income sources. Finally, it moves you through deductions, credits, and miscellaneous tax issues using a similar process.\n\nIntuit makes some welcome changes to the user experience so that it flows even more smoothly, but not to the extent that returning users will have trouble. The site is more proactive than ever, skillfully moving you along and preparing you for upcoming questions. Still, I wish TurboTax would combine some pages that have only one question to minimize clicks.\n\n(Credit: TurboTax/PCMag)\n\nWhat Kind of Help Does TurboTax Offer?\n\nTurboTax makes the tax prep process feel like one long conversation rather than a collection of separate steps. It uses clear, understandable, and lively language, explaining financial concepts as it introduces them and providing links to additional help on the interview pages. The latter links open context-sensitive articles and how-tos, usually in a vertical pane that also has direct links to topic pages when appropriate.\n\nThe help pane contains two other types of guidance. First, you can search for words and phrases to get links to help articles and related pages on the site. When you click one of the many hyperlinks in the interview, the relevant content appears in the right vertical pane. The second type comes courtesy of Intuit Assist, which works like an AI-driven version of the old TurboTax Assistant. It converses with you and allows for follow-up questions. It learns, too, something the more traditional guidance tool doesn't.\n\nIntuit Assist seems smarter than it was last year. I asked it what I thought was a challenging question, and it addressed my issue correctly. I did the same search on the site\u2019s older tool and got completely unrelated hits. Further, responses there sometimes came from TurboTax community forum pages, not Intuit employees.\n\n(Credit: TurboTax/PCMag)\n\nI encountered more error-trapping in TurboTax than I did with competitors. For example, I used the same Employer Identification Number (EIN) for two different employers on 1099-NECs. The site flagged these and asked how I wanted to handle them.\n\nH&R Block also has a traditional search option and an AI-driven interactive tool, AI Tax Assist. H&R Block\u2019s traditional search is top-notch\u2014just as effective as TurboTax. In addition, the content in H&R Block\u2019s vertical help pane changes dynamically, displaying new context-sensitive help as you advance through the site. TurboTax doesn't do this.\n\nHow Does TurboTax Deal With Self-Employment?\n\nTurboTax accommodates LLCs and REMICs that file a Form 1040 and related schedules, sole proprietors and partnerships, and S corporations. It supports small businesses of many types and all kinds of gig workers. The site does an exemplary job of walking you through all of the income and expenses that you must report.\n\nThis section of TurboTax starts by asking for your profession and posing standard small business questions. Other tax prep services, such as TaxSlayer, do this, too. TurboTax displays a home page that lists the primary sources of income for a self-employed individual, such as the 1099-NEC and cash and checks. I like how it lays all of these out on one page instead of several.\n\n(Credit: TurboTax/PCMag)\n\nMultiple Ways to Enter Expenses\n\nMost tax prep sites allow you to enter business expenses only manually by category, such as advertising and office supplies. TurboTax highlights expenses that businesspeople in your industry most commonly report, such as home office and vehicle, and looks for ones you might have missed. When I completed this section, TurboTax checked it and found two questionable entries (I had entered only round numbers, and it questioned if I really needed business insurance as an Etsy seller). It also estimated my audit risk and told me my expenses seemed reasonable for someone in my line of work. No one product does this.\n\n(Credit: TurboTax/PCMag)\n\nBut there are other options that competitors don\u2019t offer. Last year, I was able to connect a credit card to TurboTax, which then imported transactions and sorted them into appropriate tax categories. This year, the company says you will be able to import personal income and expenses from Credit Karma and business income and expenses from QuickBooks Online.\n\nOnce you complete the income and expense sections and answer some additional questions, TurboTax reports your profit or loss and related numbers on Schedule C.\n\nDoes TurboTax Check Your Return?\n\nAs mentioned, TurboTax does a lot of error-checking along the way. But it also checks both your federal and state returns once you exhaust all the topics you need to complete.\n\nWhen I ran the Federal Review, it found that I needed to revisit Child and Other Dependents Tax Credits. The site provided links to those sections, and I made the corrections. TurboTax then returned me to the Federal Review page, where it showed a personalized explanation of my refund, complete with applicable numbers. The state review didn\u2019t find any errors and presented another personalized recap of the important numbers on my return (like total income and deductions).\n\nIs TurboTax Safe to Use?\n\nIntuit says it helps safeguard your data and protect your privacy by using industry-leading practices and technology. The company claims it constantly tests and improves its cybersecurity practices, collaborating with security researchers worldwide and providing safeguards like multi-factor authentication and AES-256 data encryption.\n\nWhenever you enter personal information, such as your Social Security number and birth date, into a tax website, you should always take additional safety precautions, such as using a trusted network\u2014your home Wi-Fi, for example.\n\nCan You Do Your Taxes on Your Phone With TurboTax?\n\nEven if you have a complex tax return that involves investment sales or self-employment, you can do your tax preparation and filing via TurboTax\u2019s mobile apps for Android and iOS. The apps, which are attractive and intuitive, work like the desktop browser version and offer simple data entry and import options. They even provide access to the Intuit Assist feature.\n\n(Credit: TurboTax/PCMag)\n\nVerdict: TurboTax Is Better Than Ever\n\nTurboTax extends its impressive lead in the tax preparation field, offering a top-notch interface, exceptional guidance, and very capable mobile apps. The AI-powered Intuit Assist feature continues to improve, too, providing expanded support. Meanwhile, refinements to the interview process and the final check further cement the software's class-leading user experience. While TurboTax is on the pricey end of the spectrum, its many outstanding aspects earn it our Editors' Choice award and a full five-star rating. Our other Editors' Choice winner, FreeTaxUSA, doesn't rate quite as highly overall, but it charges nothing for federal returns.\n\n* Approximately 37% of filers qualify for TurboTax Free Edition.",

More than 50 million viewers watched the major event as over 30 artists performed at the Intuit Dome and the Kia Forum. Proceeds from FireAid, which streamed across 28 platforms, came from ticket sales at both of the venues, sponsorships, merchandise sales, and donations from the public, including private gifts.\n\nWhen Billy Crystal, wearing the same clothes he\u2019d had on the day he fled the Palisades fire as it consumed his house, took to the stage on January 30 at the Kia Forum, he announced that all donations of the night would be matched by L.A. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer and his wife, Connie Snyder. The comic and actor announced that the band U2 had just donated $1 million.\n\nThe high-energy concerts had a lineup that teetered back and forth from modern artists like Anderson.Pak, who brought out local legend Dr. Dre, to L.A. icons like Joni Mitchell, who at 81 years old, serenaded the sold-out crowd with a rare performance. Somber moments came, too, as victims of the fires shared their survival stories from the stage during the event. Actor Samuel L. Jackson was on hand to kick off the show at the Intuit Dome and shouted out the men and women who worked to contain the deadly blazes that shattered records to become the worst in L.A. history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got hundreds of first responders here in the house. Let\u2019s give them a huge round of applause,\u201d Jackson shouted, causing the crowd to erupt in applause.\n\nThe contributions made to FireAid in connection with the concerts will be distributed through L.A. non-profit the Annenberg Foundation. FireAid was the collaboration of Hollywood power couple Irving Azoff and his wife Shelli Azoff and the Azoff family, Live Nation, and the LA.. Clippers. Joel Gallen of Tenth Planet and Rick Krim produced the event.\n\n\n\nThose still interested in donating to FireAid can do so at FireAidLA.org.",

Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $3.83 billion, indicating a 12.99% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $19.27 per share and revenue of $18.27 billion.

            "content": "There are many aspects of accounting software that make it a useful tool. Most online accounting programs offer A/R, A/P, banking and reporting features. Some even include tools for inventory management, project management, time tracking and payroll. Here are some core elements of accounting software you should look for.\n\nBank Feed\n\nThis feature allows you to connect to your business bank and credit card accounts to receive a daily update of your transactions. This saves you the time it would take to manually upload statements into the system, and it gives you a daily overview of your accounts. This feature also assists with reconciliation, making it a small daily task rather than a monthly ordeal.\n\nDashboard\n\nWhen you log in to your account, you\u2019ll be greeted by a dashboard with an overview of your account activity and key metrics, such as cash flow, P&L, account balances, expenses, A/P, A/R and sales. Some software lets you customize what you see first by rearranging the information.\n\nOnline Invoicing\n\nIf your business sends invoices, the ability to email them and accept online payments can help you get paid faster. Some accounting programs integrate with third-party payment processors, whereas other vendors require you to use their in-house processing services.\n\nRecurring Invoices\n\nWith this feature, you can schedule the software to generate and send invoices for recurring charges automatically, such as subscriptions. You can choose how frequently invoices are sent \u2013 daily, weekly, monthly or annually \u2013 and indicate whether there\u2019s an end date to the billing. Many accounting software providers don\u2019t have recurring invoice functionality (we\u2019ve noted in our reviews which ones do).\n\nAutomatic Payment Reminders\n\nThis feature reminds your customers about upcoming and past-due payments. Some have sample email text you can use as is or customize. You can then choose when you want the reminders to be sent. Some programs also give you the option of sending thank-you emails to customers after you receive their payments.\n\nBank Reconciliation\n\nSmart reconciliation tools identify potential matches between your bank transactions and the bills and invoices you\u2019ve entered into the software, saving you the hours it would take to sift through records. You can then approve or deny the suggested matches. The best products we reviewed suggest potential matches as you reconcile your accounts, and a few also include a reconciliation feature on their mobile apps.\n\nBank reconciliation is a key productivity tool offered by most accounting software. Source: QuickBooks\n\nFinancial Reporting\n\nEvery accounting program generates financial reports. Some are more basic than others, and some require you to subscribe to a higher plan for advanced reporting. If you need specific types of financial reports, make sure they\u2019re included in the program and plan you choose. Detailed reports can help you interpret your financial data to make informed business decisions.\n\nIntegrations\n\nThe ability to connect your accounting software to the other business programs you use saves you the time of manually transferring data from one system to another. Highly rated payroll services, payment processing platforms, top point-of-sale systems and customer relationship management software are some popular types of integrations you may want to look for. Integration with systems you already use also cuts down on training time for employees.\n\nTracking for Billable Hours\n\nIf you\u2019re a consultant or your business is an agency that bills clients by the hour, you want accounting software that allows you to track and bill your time or integrates with the time-tracking program you already use. This is an especially important feature for freelancers.\n\nInventory Management\n\nIf you have a retail or distribution business, you\u2019ll want accounting software that tracks inventory and helps with purchase ordering. You may need to subscribe to a top-tier plan to get this feature. If you need more advanced inventory features, the best inventory software options feature a dedicated inventory management system.\n\nMobile Apps\n\nNot every accounting and invoicing program has mobile apps, but the best ones do. However, there is quite a bit of variance in app capabilities. Some can capture receipts for expense tracking only, several allow you to create and send invoices, and others have almost every feature the web-based software does. As mobile work becomes increasingly convenient, it\u2019s worth verifying that a company offers a mobile app with its software.\n\nMobile apps allow you to perform accounting functions on the go. Source: Xero\n\nProject-Based Billing\n\nFirms, freelancers and consultants who work with clients on projects or jobs should look for accounting software that helps them track tasks and budgets. The software should allow you to invoice customers for tracked time and rebill them for project expenses.\n\nSupport for Multiple Businesses\n\nSeveral programs we reviewed allow you to add more than one business to your account, though some of them charge extra for this convenience.",

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nNyota, a bonobo at Ape Initiative, was part of the experiment. Credit: Ape Initiative\n\nTo get treats, apes eagerly pointed them out to humans who didn't know where they were, a seemingly simple experiment that demonstrated for the first time that apes will communicate unknown information in the name of teamwork. The study also provides the clearest evidence to date that apes can intuit another's ignorance, an ability thought to be uniquely human.\n\nThe work by researchers with Johns Hopkins University's Social and Cognitive Origins Group was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\"The ability to sense gaps in one another's knowledge is at the heart of our most sophisticated social behaviors, central to the ways we cooperate, communicate and work together strategically,\" said co-author Chris Krupenye, a Johns Hopkins assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences who studies how animals think.\n\n\"Because this so-called theory of mind supports many of the capacities that make humans unique, like teaching and language, many believe it is absent from animals. But this work demonstrates the rich mental foundations that humans and other apes share\u2014and suggests that these abilities evolved millions of years ago in our common ancestors.\"\n\nKrupenye and co-author Luke Townrow, a Johns Hopkins Ph.D. student, worked with three male bonobos, Nyota, 25; Kanzi, 43; and Teco, 13, all living at Ape Initiative, a research and education nonprofit.\n\nDuring the experiment, one of the bonobos would sit with Townrow, facing each other across a table. The bonobo would watch as a second person placed a treat, a grape or a Cheerio, under one of three cups. Sometimes Townrow could see where the treat was going, sometimes he couldn't. The bonobo could have the treat if Townrow could find it.\n\nApes eagerly pointed out the location of treats to humans who didn't know where they were. Credit: Johns Hopkins University\n\nWhether or not Townrow saw where the treat was hidden, he'd say, \"Where's the grape?\" and then wait 10 seconds. If he'd seen the treat being hidden, during the 10 seconds the ape would usually sit still and wait for the treat. But when Townrow hadn't seen where the treat was hidden, the ape would quickly point to the right cup\u2014sometimes quite demonstratively.\n\n\"Their fingers would point right through the mesh\u2014it was clear what they were trying to communicate,\" Krupenye said. \"One, Kanzi, who was very food motivated, would point repeatedly in certain phases of the experiment\u2014he'd tap several times to get our attention and was quite insistent about it.\"\n\nThe work is the first to replicate in a controlled setting similar findings from the wild that suggest chimpanzees will vocalize to warn groupmates ignorant to potential threats, such as a snake.\n\n\"We predicted that if apes are really tracking ignorance, when their partners lacked knowledge they would be pointing more often and more quickly and that's exactly what they did,\" Krupenye said.\n\n\"The results also suggest apes can simultaneously hold two conflicting world views in their mind. They know exactly where the food is, and at the same time, they know that their partner's view of the same situation is missing that information.\"\n\nDuring the experiments, apes eagerly pointed out treats to humans who didn't know where they were, but when humans had watched the treats being placed the apes did not point. Credit: Johns Hopkins University\n\nThe team was thrilled to further confirm the apes' mental sophistication.\n\n\"There are debates in the field about the capabilities of primates and for us it was exciting to confirm that they really do have these rich capacities that some people have denied them,\" Krupenye said.\n\nNext the team will work to more deeply explore the apes' motivations and how they think about other individuals' minds.\n\n\"What we've shown here is that apes will communicate with a partner to change their behavior,\" said Townrow, \"but a key open question for further research is whether apes are also pointing to change their partner's mental state or their beliefs.\"\n\nMore information: Townrow, Luke A., Bonobos point more for ignorant than knowledgeable social partners, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2025).

In the UK, HMRC-themed phishing attacks targeted businesses with credential-stealing websites.\n\nIn the US, over 40,000 Intuit-themed phishing emails were sent in January 2025 alone.\n\nMeanwhile, in Switzerland, fraud campaigns impersonated federal tax authorities, requesting bogus payments to adversary-controlled Revolut accounts.\n\nTax-themed cyberattacks are particularly effective due to their timing and perceived urgency. Recipients are often compelled to act quickly on such communications, making them vulnerable to scams.\n\nFinancial organizations are prime targets because of their critical role in processing sensitive data and transactions.\n\nTo mitigate these threats, organizations should educate employees about recognizing phishing attempts, implement multi-factor authentication for all accounts, and deploy advanced email filtering systems to detect malicious attachments and links.\n\nAdditionally, regularly updating antivirus software and monitoring for indicators of compromise (IoCs) are crucial steps to ensure robust security.\n\nOrganizations must strengthen defenses against evolving threats like this campaign that exploits trust in authoritative entities to deliver destructive malware payloads.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nSecurity teams should monitor for these IOCs:-\n\nIndicator Description First Seen hxxps://clearlivate[.]com/xxx/rest.html Phishing URL January 16, 2025 hxxps://drakesoftware[.]blob[.]core.windows.net/...

Another key beneficiary of Redick\u2019s system was Anthony Davis, who was surprisingly traded for Luka Doncic. Following the blockbuster deal, an NBA insider revealed the reason behind Davis departure from the Lakers.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to that key word for a moment: alpha. While Davis had no shortage of fans within the Lakers\u2019 walls, there was also a strong sense that he wasn\u2019t \u20181-A\u2019 material. League sources say there were concerns about his durability and availability and a belief that he could never truly be counted on as a top option in the future,\u201d reported NBA insider Marc Stein.\n\nAccording to reports, the Lakers doubted Anthony Davis could sustain his performance long term. With LeBron James\u2019 potential retirement on the horizon, the team aimed to build a sustainable future by securing a proven offensive leader. Despite his injury, Luka Doncic has already established himself as one of the NBA\u2019s best players at a young age.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, this move carries significant risk for the Lakers, as Anthony Davis had firmly established himself as the team\u2019s offensive leader, averaging over 30 points in multiple games and currently posting 25.7 points, 11.9 rebounds, and 3.4 assists per game this season. Beyond Davis, the only other player, besides the undisputed LeBron James, with the ability to take on a leadership role is Austin Reaves.\n\nAnthony Davis #3 of the Los Angeles Lakers makes a slam dunk against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first half at Crypto.com Arena on December 31, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuka Doncic\u2019s fitness remains uncertain as he continues recovering from his injury and adapting to his new team. If he struggles early on, the Lakers could face challenges, forcing Austin Reaves to take on a larger offensive role. While Doncic\u2019s current physical condition is unknown, his talent is undeniable given his proven ability on the court. In the long run, he is expected to thrive, but in the short term, some doubts could emerge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nsee also LeBron James reacts after shocking Anthony Davis reported trade for Luka Doncic to the Mavericks\n\nCould the Lakers\u2019 season be derailed by Anthony Davis\u2019 departure?\n\nOn the surface, the Lakers could face short-term struggles following Anthony Davis\u2019 departure, as he exceeded expectations and was the driving force behind the team\u2019s strong performance this season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, whether Davis could sustain that level long term remains speculative. The bigger question now is whether Luka Doncic can regain peak physical form before the NBA playoffs, ensuring he delivers his best for the Lakers when it matters most.",

For instance, the price of Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stock is up an impressive 104% over the last five years.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Intuit\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Intuit achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 15% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 57.68.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNasdaqGS:INTU Earnings Per Share Growth February 1st 2025\n\nWe know that Intuit has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Intuit will grow revenue in the future.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Intuit's TSR for the last 5 years was 111%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nInvestors in Intuit had a tough year, with a total loss of 5.4% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 24%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 16% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Intuit better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for Intuit that you should be aware of.",

We really pride ourselves on being in the passing lanes, being on early help, because we feel like we\u2019re one of the best defensive teams in the country,\u201d said Hightower, who was awarded the game MVP trophy. \u201cWe just take a lot of pride in our defense and work on it every day in practice. And we just want to come out here and show we\u2019re the best defensive team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our main thing when we come to the games \u2014 lock up their best players, know the scout. We hang our hat on that,\u201d said Bryce Cofield, who finished with 15 points and six rebounds. \u201cRotate, help each other, and just be one mind on the court.\u201d\n\nThe Trailblazers looked like they were playing with a giddy-up in their step, feeding off the crowd\u2019s energy.\n\nBut much like Cofield\u2019s on-court demeanor \u2014 one of a controlled passion \u2014 Sierra Canyon kept its cool in the big moments, finishing the game strong by making free throws and locking down Notre Dame on defense.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s a pretty big win for our season going forward, like our seeding and stuff like that, but I feel like games like this are normal to us,\u201d said Cofield. \u201cWe take every game as if it\u2019s at the Intuit Dome, a lot of fans, we take every game as if it\u2019s that. So I feel like it\u2019s a pretty normal feeling for us.\u201d\n\nMaxi Adams added 18 points and seven rebounds and played solid defense on Stokes, not giving him easy looks at the basket and forcing him to earn his points at the free-throw line.\n\nStokes finished with 23 points and 10 rebounds before fouling out with less than two minutes remaining in the game.\n\nSierra Canyon finishes the regular season with a 20-4 overall record and a 6-1 Mission League record.\n\nAs the No. 3 seed in the Mission League Tournament, Notre Dame gets a first-round bye and will play at home on Monday. The Knights finish the regular season with a 20-5 overall record and 5-2 Mission League record.",

They launched into \u201cBreed,\" \u201cSchool\u201d and \u201cTerritorial Pissings\" respectively, inspired and unexpected choices.\n\nDrummer Dave Grohl's daughter Violet Grohl then emerged on stage for \u201cAll Apologies.\u201d\n\nGreen Day kicked off the massive show by launching into \u201cLast Night on Earth\" at the Kia Forum and were soon joined by Billie Eilish for the first surprise of the night.\n\nAfter their set, Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong hugged actor Billy Crystal , who was there to welcome to the crowd at the Kia Forum.\n\n\u201cOur goal is simple tonight, to spend more money than the Dodgers spent on free agents,\u201d he joked. He told the audience U2 offered the first big donation of the night: $1 million dollars.\n\nCrystal said he was wearing the clothes he had on when he evacuated. He lost his home in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood that he lived in for 46 years.\n\nIs there any band more Southern California in spirit and geography than the Red Hot Chili Peppers? Bassist Flea did a handstand on stage wearing only a Speedo before they launched into one of their countless odes to the state: \u201cDani California,\" \u201cCalifornication\" and \u201cUnder the Bridge.\u201d\n\nThe first true-blue Los Angeles moment came from a surprise performance by Dr. Dre . The progenitor of West Coast hip-hop tackled \u201cStill D.R.E.\u201d with Anderson .Paak and Sheila E. before pivoting to Tupac and Dre\u2019s classic \u201cCalifornia Love.\u201d\n\nIt was followed by the figurehead of Laurel Canyon folk, a moving set of \u201cBoth Sides Now\u201d by Joni Mitchell.\n\nLater in the night, the recently reunited, Orange Country ska punk legends No Doubt launched into \u201cI'm Just a Girl,\" \u201cDon't Speak\" and \u201cSpiderwebs,\u201d led by frontwoman Gwen Stefani.\n\nKaty Perry was joined by the Pasadena Chorale for \u201cRise\u201d before launching into \u201cRoar\u201d and \u201cCalifornia Gurls.\u201d She paraded across the stage with the California state flag in hand.\n\nAn hour and a half after Green Day performed, the show launched at the nearby Intuit Dome with presenter Samuel L. Jackson, an Altadena fire fighter who lost his home while fighting to save others, and Rod Stewart.\n\nPink did a stripped-down version of \u201cWhat About Us,\u201d Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cBabe I\u2019m Gonna Leave You\" and \u201cMe and Bobby McGee,\" which was made famous by Janis Joplin.\n\nStevie Nicks did \u201cEdge of Seventeen,\u201d \u201cStand Back\u201d and \u201cLandslide,\u201d and told the story of evacuating her Pacific Palisades home that miraculously did not burn down. Her home is mostly wood, built in 1938, and she theorized its loss would have destroyed the whole street.\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire did a medley of their biggest hits: \u201cThat\u2019s the Way of the World,\u201d \u201cShining Star\u201d and \u201cSeptember.\u201d The Black Crowes backed up John Fogerty for \u201cHave You Ever Seen the Rain?\u201d Then the band was joined by Slash.\n\nGen Z favorite Gracie Abrams was backed by The National's Aaron Dessner, a moment when the screams of women in the audience overpowered the men. Lil Baby offered a rare hip-hop break in the night of mostly pop and rock with his hits \u201cSo Sorry\u201d and \u201cEmotionally Scarred.\"\n\nTate McRae performed her 2020 cut \u201cYou Broke Me First\u201d and a cover of Crowded House\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over.\u201d Jelly Roll brought country music to the event, performing his hit \u201cI Am Not Okay\u201d and a cover of Bob Seger\u2019s \u201cHollywood Nights\u201d with Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker .\n\nBehind the performers, images of firefighters and the devastation brought forth by the fires appeared on screen.\n\nBetween sets, survivors telling stories of losing their homes were broadcast throughout the arena, both in person and in video packages.\n\nNon-celebrities brought heart. The Williams family, including four daughters and their mother, took the stage and discussed losing four homes in Altadena, California. They introduced the folk rock band Dawes, whose members also were directly affected by the Eaton fire.\n\nDawes\u2019 Taylor Goldsmith lost a portion of the Altadena house he shares with actor-singer Mandy Moore and his home recording studio and instruments were destroyed . Goldsmith\u2019s brother and bandmate, Griffin Goldsmith, and his pregnant wife also lost their home in the fire.",

            "content": "Doing your taxes is already complex and annoying \u2014 don't let it be expensive, too. There are many ways you can submit your income tax return for 2024 for free, including through TurboTax.\n\nMore than 10 million people file their taxes for free each year through TurboTax, which is owned by Intuit. Right now, there is one main way folks can use TurboTax to do their taxes at no cost. (More on that below.)\n\nIf you're looking for other options, you might want to start with the IRS itself. It offers free guided tax prep through its Free File and Direct File programs.\n\nIs TurboTax free?\n\nFiling with TurboTax can be free if you have a simple 1040 tax return with no special situations and do not opt for any add-ons, or if you take advantage of its limited-time app offer. We'll cover these later in this article.\n\nHistorically, though, there has been some controversy about whether or not TurboTax's \"free\" offerings were really free.\n\nIntuit announced in 2021 that it was choosing not to renew its participation in IRS Free File. Though TurboTax had been part of IRS Free File since its 2003 launch, the company pulled out, blaming \"limitations within the program and conflicting demands from those outside the program.\"\n\nIt wasn't a smooth exit. The decision came a few years after ProPublica published a story alleging that TurboTax was using code to purposefully hide its IRS Free File product from Google and other search engines. (After the article went live, Intuit changed the code.)\n\nIn March 2022, the Federal Trade Commission filed a legal complaint accusing Intuit of running deceptive ads that tricked folks into thinking doing their taxes through TurboTax was free, only to learn at the end of the process \u2014 \"after they have invested time and effort gathering and inputting into TurboTax their sensitive personal and financial information\" \u2014 that they'd have to upgrade to a paid service.\n\nThen, in January 2024, the FTC formally prohibited Intuit from advertising anything as free unless \"unless it is free for all consumers or it discloses clearly and conspicuously and in close proximity to the 'free' claim the percentage of taxpayers or consumers that qualify.\" Intuit appealed, saying in a statement to Money that \"over the last 11 years, we\u2019ve helped more than 130 million Americans file their taxes free of charge \u2014 more than all other tax prep software companies combined.\" It added it \"has always been clear, fair and transparent with its customers and is committed to free tax preparation.\"\n\nCan I file my 2024 taxes for free through TurboTax?\n\nYes, depending on how you do it.\n\nYou can use TurboTax Free Edition, for which Intuit says about 37% of taxpayers qualify. This DIY free edition can be used to file simple Form 1040 returns only, meaning it's not for any schedules except for those associated with the earned income tax credit, child tax credit and student loan interest. TurboTax Free Edition is available year-round; you can also file state taxes this way.\n\nEarlier this tax season, there was also a limited-time-only mobile app offer that let you file your taxes for free with some restrictions. People qualified only if they did not use TurboTax to file their 2023 tax returns, and they had to start and finish their own individual taxes in the TurboTax mobile app by 11:59 p.m. ET on Feb. 18. This deal has since expired.\n\nAds by Money. We may be compensated if you click this ad.

File Your Taxes\n\nWhen is TurboTax not free?\n\nAlthough you can start a return for free and pay only when you file, TurboTax is ultimately not free when you choose certain advanced services or add-ons. And prices tend to change throughout the tax season, so the longer you wait, the more expensive it tends to get. (This is not solely a TurboTax phenomenon \u2014 other tax prep companies hike their prices closer to the April 15 deadline, too.)\n\nThe cost for DIY Deluxe service is currently $59 for federal taxes and $59 for state. The DIY Premium option \u2014 tailored for investors and self-employed taxpayers \u2014 is $119 for federal and $59 for state.\n\nIf you choose TurboTax Live Assisted, which lets you access unlimited expert help and have an expert look over your federal return before you file, costs start at $69 for federal and $54 for state, depending on what service level you select. The base price for the deluxe level of TurboTax Live Assisted is $129 and $209 for the premium level, per the company's website.\n\nAnd if you opt for TurboTax Live Full Service, in which an expert does your taxes for you, pricing starts at $119 for federal and $64 for state.\n\nOn its website, TurboTax says prices are \"based on your actual tax situation and forms used,\" given that \"more complicated tax situations and higher levels of tax expert services may cost more, depending on the product you select.\"\n\nIf you add a feature like Audit Defense, which is part of the PLUS and MAX bundles, you'll incur extra charges. You'll also have to pay for the 5 Days Early Refund perk, which is a $25 flat fee, per a news release.\n\nWhy is TurboTax not free?\n\nNot all TurboTax products are free because it's a business.\n\nTurboTax is owned by Intuit, which is a public company. In the first fiscal quarter of 2025, which at Intuit ended Oct. 31, Intuit says it brought in $3.3 billion in revenue.\n\nOn its website, TurboTax has a frequently asked questions section that tackles the issue of \"how does TurboTax make money?\" The answer: \"We want our customers to love our products and services. Because we have customers who pay for our premium products and services, we can offer free tax filing to many customers.\"\n\nWho gets TurboTax free?\n\nIntuit says 37% of taxpayers qualify to use TurboTax's DIY Free Edition, which is meant for filing simple Form 1040 returns only.\n\nOnline TurboTax products are also free if you're an active-duty or reserve member of the U.S. military. If you get a W-2 from the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS), you qualify for free federal and state tax prep through TurboTax, no matter what level of service you choose, says Karen Nolan, an Intuit TurboTax spokesperson.\n\nOther ways to file your taxes for free in 2025\n\nTaxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of $84,000 or less are eligible for IRS Free File, a public-private partnership that unlocks free guided tax prep from one of eight name-brand companies. Above that income threshold, you can access Free File Fillable Forms, which is not guided and requires more tax knowledge.\n\nAnother route is IRS Direct File, a relatively new initiative that enables taxpayers who lived and worked in 25 states in 2024 to file federal taxes online directly with the IRS. Those states include Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nYou may also be able to find a free e-filing product through another third party, like H&R Block, or access free tax prep through the IRS's Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) initiatives.\n\nAds by Money.

Billie Eilish, Green Day, Joni Mitchell, John Fogerty, Gracie Abrams, No Doubt, Jelly Roll and Stevie Nicks were among the acts who\u2019ve taken the stage. Katy Perry took the stage backed by the Pasadena Chorale, which lost its home base when the Altadena Community Church burned down. Some of its singers and its founding artistic director, Jeffrey Bernstein, lost homes in the fire.\n\nThe bill also included Olivia Rodrigo, Lady Gaga, Stevie Wonder, Peso Pluma and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, among many others. Produced by a team of music-industry veterans led by Irving Azoff and his family, FireAid was live-streamed on an array of platforms including Netflix, Hulu, Max, Apple TV+, Prime Video and Twitch. Connie and Steve Ballmer, who own the Clippers as well as Intuit Dome and the Forum, have pledged to match all donations made during the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times\u2019 Mikael Wood and August Brown were on site, delivering live updates as they happened.\n\n5:45 p.m. Hello from the floor at the Forum for the early shift of FireAid, which may not quite be Music\u2019s Biggest Night (that\u2019s the Grammys on Sunday), but it certainly feels like it given the sheer star caliber of lineups here and at Intuit Dome a little later. Dave Matthews dropped off the bill for a family emergency, but still in store here are Alanis Morissette, Anderson .Paak, John Mayer, Dawes, Graham Nash, No Doubt, P!nk, Stephen Stills and the Black Crowes.

(August Brown)\n\n6:11 p.m. And greetings from a very empty Intuit Dome, where the music is supposed to get underway at 7:30 \u2014 a message that appears to have reached the people of L.A. loud and clear. FireAid organizers have said the Forum bill leans rock while the lineup at Intuit is more pop. Wonder what Rod Stewart (who\u2019s on the bill here) thinks about that. (Mikael Wood)\n\n7:02 p.m. Green Day kicking this off with an elegant version of \u201cLast Night on Earth\u201d only to bring out another Billie from the second show down the road: Eilish, who came out to sing the second verse. (AB)\n\nBillie Eilish and Billie Joe Armstrong early in the FireAid benefit. (Chris Pizzello / Invision / AP)\n\n7:04 p.m. Intuit Dome is showing the Forum performances on the arena\u2019s so-called Halo Board, and the two Billies drew a huge cheer from the crowd here. (MW)\n\n7:17 p.m \u201cHere at the Forum,\u201d comedian Billy Crystal said, \u201cthe goal is to raise more money than the Dodgers spent on free agents.\u201d They\u2019re off to a good start\u2013Crystal announced U2 just called in a million dollar donation. He also acknowledged losing his own home in the Palisades Fire. \u201cThese are the clothes I fled in,\u201d he said, explaining that he looks like an evacuee or \u201csomebody who robbed a 7/11.\u201d He said that this gig had echoes of a similar fundraising host gig he took on after 9/11. \u201cNow I\u2019m one of the hurting thousands asking \u2018have you seen my church, have you seen my town?\u201d (AB)\n\n7:18 p.m. Nice monologue from Crystal, who\u2019s been doing this kind of thing \u2014 threading the needle between humor and pathos \u2014 for \u2026 what? Half a century? \u201cOne city, one heart,\u201d he concludes. (MW)\n\n7:24 p.m. Hopeful vibes from Alanis Morrissette, whose \u201cHand in My Pocket\u201d and \u201cThank U\u201d carried an air of gratitude and resilience as she wore an \u201cI Heart LA\u201d shirt: a \u201ccolorful, Wild place,\u201d as she called it. (AB)\n\n7:27 p.m. Alanis Morissette singing \u201cThank U\u201d is a great opportunity to ponder one of the wildest opening lyrics in pop history: \u201cHow \u2018bout getting off of these antibiotics?\u201d (MW)\n\nAnderson .Paak and Sheila E. at the Forum in Inglewood. (Chris Pizzello / Invision / AP)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7:30 p.m. If you hold an all-star concert in L.A. and you don\u2019t have Sheila E show up to whale on the timbales \u2014 as Ms. E just did with Anderson .Paak \u2014 did the concert really happen? (MW)\n\n7:32 p.m. Glad they\u2019re making ample time for individual horror stories about surviving the fires. \u201cI wish it was just a terrible dream or a nightmare,\u201d one Altadena resident said in a video. \u201cEverything I\u2019m wearing was provided by someone else. But I\u2019m a carpenter, I want to rebuild Altadena. There are brighter days ahead.\u201d (AB)\n\n7:39 p.m. Crowd goes absolutely ham to Dr. Dre popping out for \u201cStill D.R.E.\u201d And \u201cCalifornia Love\u201d With Anderson .Paak. The Azoff Rolodex goes deep. (AB)\n\n7:41 p.m. Crowd in here includes very soused Gen Xers who got a babysitter so they could happily justify dropping a grand on a big night out for fire relief. (AB)\n\n7:42 p.m. Crowd at Intuit (which is nearing a full house) is older than I would\u2019ve expected \u2014 but, as August suggests, FireAid tickets weren\u2019t cheap. (MW)\n\n7:50 p.m. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone better to console us than Joni Mitchell,\u201d Morrissette said, introducing the doyenne of the California canyons to perform the regal and resonant \u201cBoth Sides Now,\u201d with a stripped back version of her Joni Jam band. \u201cI really don\u2019t know life at all,\u201d she sang to close on a plaintive note. A reminder to Cherish your L.A. treasures while we\u2019ve still got them. (AB)\n\n7:52 p.m. I\u2019ve had the privilege of seeing Mitchell perform several times in the past couple of years \u2014 that may have been the strongest she\u2019s sounded yet. (MW)\n\n7:56 p.m. Members of the Williams family from Altadena recalled onstage, \u201cAt 3:30 in morning, the warning hit our phones. We grabbed what we could \u2014 our grandmothers special clock, our father\u2019s ashes, our 47-year-old parrot Hank. Among the five of us standing here, we lost four homes and we\u2019re struggling to find places to live. We love our community \u2014 we\u2019re all grieving immense loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt our mother\u2019s home, everything was destroyed except her front door,\u201d they said. \u201cIt stands. It\u2019s a sign, because that door was always open.\u201d (AB)\n\nTaylor Goldsmith of Dawes at the FireAid benefit. (Chris Pizzello / Invision / AP)\n\n8:08 p.m. Poignant lyrics from the band Dawes, whose singer and drummer both lost homes and studios in Altadena. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that special kind of sadness, a tragic set of charms / That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles / Makes me want to wrap you in my arms.\u201d This city can feel like it\u2019s got disaster in its bones right now and surviving is a mark of making a life here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen they brought out Stephen Stills and Mike Campbell of the Heartbreakers for Buffalo Springfield\u2019s \u201cFor What It\u2019s Worth.\u201d A reminder of all the music history that went up in this blaze, too. (AB)\n\nStephen Stills, left, and Graham Nash at the Forum. (Chris Pizzello / Invision / AP)\n\n8:13 p.m. Graham Nash joins his old bandmate, Stephen Stills, to dispense a bit of local mythology \u2014 \u201cWhenever Los Angeles gets into trouble, the musicians are right there,\u201d he says \u2014 and a comforting rendition of \u201cTeach Your Children.\u201d (MW)\n\n8:22 p.m. \u201cIf you\u2019re hurting, I\u2019m hurting with you,\u201d said Pink in an all-black funereal outfit. \u201cI\u2019m gonna keep my feet on the ground tonight,\u201d she promised, alluding to her usual aerial routines, but sang a knockout take of \u201cMe and Bobby McGee,\u201d a song she said brought her comfort in bad times. (AB)\n\n8:28 p.m. Pink digs deep into her classic-rock bag for a scorching version of (Led Zeppelin\u2019s version of) \u201cBabe I\u2019m Gonna Leave You.\u201d (MW)\n\n8:35 p.m. Samuel L. Jackson is starting the show here at Intuit Dome by shouting out the first responders in the house: \u201cWe love our firefighters and we need to help them,\u201d Jackson says. Then he introduces Rod Stewart as a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Famer \u2014 and his former neighbor. L.A.! (MW)\n\n8:36 p.m. Can you imagine the Samuel L Jackson / Rod Stewart dinner parties we\u2019ve been missing out on? Rod doing the Ezekiel 25:17 speech? Sam covering \u201cMaggie May?\u201d (AB)\n\n8:39 p.m. \u201cHere\u2019s a new song,\u201d Stewart says. \u201cNot.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cMaggie May,\u201d of course, a song nobody in history has ever been sad to hear. Invite Rod to everything, is what I say. (MW)\n\n8:48 p.m. Pink\u2019s way of addressing the crowd to John Mayer: \u201cLadies and gentlemen and every other gender that absolutely exists.\u201d (MW)\n\n8:49 p.m. Despite the conflicts about climate and class inherent in the fires, the hosts have been avoiding politics until Pink tossed in that allusion to the current administration. Wonder if Billie Eilish or anyone with a passion for climate activism will make a more fervent point about it later. (AB)\n\nJohn Mayer onstage at the Forum for FireAid. (Chris Pizzello / Invision / AP)\n\n8:57 p.m. Mayer, understanding the assignment as usual, describes Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cFree Fallin\u2019\u201d as \u201cour first insight into the dream of living in California.\u201d (MW)\n\n9:04 p.m. I love that Earth, Wind and Fire tapped straight in with \u201cThat\u2019s the Way of the World\u201d \u2014 a song about \u201chearts of fire\u201d \u2014 without a second thought. That\u2019s how strong their vibes are and how welcome this tune is. (AB)\n\n9:05 p.m. And now Earth, Wind and Fire is bringing the house down with the immortal \u201cSeptember,\u201d a song with real-deal healing powers. Somebody give Verdine White a seat on the county Board of Supervisors. (MW)\n\nVerdine White, center, with Serg Dimitrijevic, left, and Philip Bailey Jr. of Earth, Wind & Fire. (Jordan Strauss / Invision / AP)\n\n9:16 p.m. John Fogerty is hitting us where we live right now with Creedence Clearwater Revival\u2019s immortal \u201cHave You Ever Seen the Rain?\u201d If only this parched city had seen a lot more of it earlier in winter. (AB)\n\n9:18 p.m. Second Zeppelin cover of the night: Chris and Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes doing \u201cGoing to California\u201d with Slash, whom Chris accurately notes needed no introduction. (The top hat helps.) (MW)\n\n9:21 p.m. Not the point of the evening, necessarily, but consider Gracie Abrams\u2019 stardom secured. The crowd at Intuit just roared louder for the 25-year-old singer \u2014 a proud Palisades native, for what it\u2019s worth \u2014 than they roared for anyone else all night. Accompanied by Aaron Dessner on acoustic guitar, she\u2019s doing a stone-cold L.A. classic: Counting Crows\u2019 \u201cA Long December.\u201d (MW)\n\nGwen Stefani and No Doubt (Chris Pizzello / Invision / AP)\n\n9:33 p.m. Truly, who else are you going to call for this gig than No Doubt, the SoCal-est of SoCal bands, launches with \u201cJust a Girl.\u201d The band reunited for Coachella last year and might well have to keep it going if the Forum crowd has any say in it. (AB)\n\n9:36 p.m. \u201cDon\u2019t Speak.\u201d That\u2019s it \u2014 that\u2019s the tweet. (MW)\n\n9:49 p.m. Stray thought during Tate McRae\u2019s set: the long tail of OneRepublic\u2019s \u201cApologize.\u201d (MW)\n\n9:56 p.m. I remember talking to McRae about moving to L.A. from Canada and what a culture shock it was for her. Wonder how the imagery of the fires will affect people around the world who had considered moving here for the usual reasons \u2013 and now see how quickly that fantasy can turn devastating. (AB)\n\n9:54 p.m. \u201cI am honored to play some country music\u201d Jelly Roll says before muscling through \u201cI Am Not OK,\u201d a song about knowing that he can\u2019t be the only one holding on for dear life. And then: a rollicking cover of the great Bob Seger\u2019s \u201cHollywood Nights,\u201d for which he\u2019s joined by Travis Barker. What a song! More Seger (just in general), please. (MW)\n\nJelly Roll at FireAid (Jordan Strauss / Invision / AP)\n\n10:02 p.m. I tell you, anytime I think of leaving this town, there is nothing like some \u201cHollywood Nights\u201d to pull me right back in. (AB)\n\n10:13 p.m. \u201cGonna go a little rogue here,\u201d Stevie Nicks says as she recounts the night that the fires raced toward her Palisades home, a 1938 wood house that miraculously survived thanks to firefighters from Santa Rosa. \u201cI cannot believe the bravery of these men,\u201d she says. From the stage she gives them a special dedication of \u201cLandslide,\u201d which has got to be an all-timer of a thank you. (AB)\n\n10:15 p.m. Stevie sometimes hits the autopilot in concert these days \u2014 hey, she\u2019s been at it a while \u2014 but this \u201cLandslide\u201d is stunning: a full-body immersion into the certainty that life is gonna throw you for a loop now and then. (MW)\n\n10:39 p.m. St. Vincent, Kim Gordon and Joan Jett each fronting a full-on Nirvana reunion \u2014 what a way to wind down the night! Good on Dave Grohl for turning out for this, given everything. Really hope Kim Gordon wins a Grammy this weekend. \u201cThe Collective\u201d absolutely rules. (AB)\n\nViolet Grohl, performs with Dave Grohl of Nirvana during the FireAid. (Chris Pizzello / Chris Pizzello/invision/ap)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10:39 p.m. Grohl, Pat Smear and Krist Novoselic have almost-reunited Nirvana a few times over the last decade or so, often without warning and often for a good cause. Joan Jett just popped out to do \u201cTerritorial Pissings,\u201d and now Grohl\u2019s 18-year-old daughter, Violet, is here to sing \u201cAll Apologies\u201d (with Novoselic on accordion). The band sounds great \u2014 bludgeoning but tuneful, heavy yet light on its feet. (MW)\n\n10:51 p.m. Good on the producers for including a segment acknowledging all the animals lost or affected. To me that\u2019s one of the undercovered parts of this tragedy. (AB)\n\n10:53 p.m. For all its stars, FireAid is extremely short on hip-hop \u2014 and now, sitting inside Intuit Dome as Lil Baby plays to a dead room, I can see what organizers were trying to avoid. Definitely not a rap crowd. (MW)\n\nFlea, left, and Anthony Kiedis of Red Hot Chili Peppers perform at The Forum during the FireAid. (Chris Pizzello / Chris Pizzello/invision/ap)\n\n11:05 p.m. And now, of course, we have arrived at the end, ready for the undisputed Los Angeles poet laureates of songs about California, the voices born ready at a moment of lament and longing for the Golden State, the only fair choice to wrap this thing up\u2026who else could it possibly be but the Red Hot Chili Peppers with Flea in a Speedo? (AB)\n\n11:26 p.m. Cute moment at the end where Green Day\u2019s Tr\u00e9 Cool snuck up and handed off a replacement pair of drum sticks a fan from the Palisades lost in the fire. (AB)\n\nOlivia Rodrigo performs during the FireAid at Intuit Dome. (Jordan Strauss / Jordan Strauss/invision/ap)\n\n11:29 p.m. We\u2019re entering the homestretch at Intuit with Olivia Rodrigo, who says that she finds L.A. \u201cso beautiful and so inspiring\u201d and that she\u2019s written many songs about the place, including the one she\u2019s gonna play now: \u201cDeja Vu,\u201d in which she recounts a drive to Malibu for strawberry ice cream. (MW)\n\n11:40 p.m. I stand corrected that the Red Hot Chili Peppers were gonna close this thing. Five hours in, we\u2019ve still ostensibly got Lady Gaga and Peso Pluma and Sting and Billie Eilish and Stevie Wonder to come! The Grammys are amateurs compared to this monster runtime. (AB)\n\n11:42 p.m. Wearing a turtleneck, tight trousers and a motivational speaker\u2019s headset microphone \u2014 call him Sting Jobs? \u2014 Sting is power-trio-ing his way through the Police\u2019s \u201cMessage in a Bottle.\u201d (MW)\n\n11:52 p.m. All respect to Peso Pluma for coming out to this, but this also would have been a great moment to showcase some local Latin music on a big stage in some capacity, especially given how deeply the fires affected local livelihoods and working class families. (AB)\n\n11:57 p.m. Billie Eilish and her brother, Finneas, are going the acoustic-on-stools route for delicate versions of \u201cWildflower\u201d and \u201cThe Greatest\u201d \u2014 all the better to admire the siblings\u2019 intricately intertwined vocal harmonies. (MW)\n\n12:09 a.m. \u201cL.A. is like my favorite place in the world and my only home,\u201d Eilish says as she introduces an especially airy \u201cBirds of a Feather.\u201d (MW)\n\n12:24 a.m. Lovely to still have Stevie Wonder as a fixed point in a turning world for fraught moments like this. \u201cLove\u2019s in Need of Love Today\u201d is the top of the canon for healing and optimism, and this probably hits home for the intergenerational Black families in attendance that lost so much in Altadena. (AB)\n\n12:30 a.m. \u201cLet\u2019s hit it,\u201d Stevie tells his band \u2014 his cue to rev up \u201cSuperstition,\u201d for which Sting joins him. Now Flea is up there too (in a Lakers-gold beret) for a thrumming \u201cHigher Ground.\u201d Who\u2019d ever turn down an offer to jam with Stevie? (MW)\n\n12:35 a.m. Finally, Jimmy Kimmel offered a specific thank you towards the incarcerated firefighters who play a fundamental role on the front lines of protecting urban and wildlands in SoCal. Let\u2019s take the occasion to give them a raise and better path to a career in firefighting down the road. (AB)\n\n12:37 a.m. FireAid\u2019s closer is Lady Gaga, who\u2019s starting her set behind a piano with a pair of tunes from \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d: a solo take on her and Bradley Cooper\u2019s \u201cShallow\u201d and a muscular rendition of \u201cAlways Remember Us This Way.\u201d Her vocals are on point. (MW)\n\n12:42 a.m. Gaga says she \u201cwanted to do something hopeful\u201d for the show but couldn\u2019t find the right song \u2014 so she wrote a new one with her fianc\u00e9, Michael Polansky. \u201cIt\u2019s just for tonight \u2014 just for you,\u201d she says, and it\u2019s a bouncy musical-theater-ish number about the healing power of time. (MW)\n\n12:46 a.m. Well, a new single-use, one-night-only Lady Gaga single seems like a fitting and hopeful way to sign off. The recovery effort in SoCal will take years, but this was a heartfelt and hopefully lucrative step on the way to whatever healing comes next. Thanks for coming along on the ride with us, see you all Sunday at the Grammys. (AB)",

            "content": "The City of Angels was serenaded by over two dozen artists Thursday during a star-studded benefit that raised money for those affected by the devastating L.A.-area fires.\n\nThe FireAid concert, which spanned over five hours, was held at the Kia Forum and Intuit Dome, which are adjacent to each other in the Inglewood area. Lady Gaga closed the show by performing numbers from the 2018 film \"A Star Is Born,\" as well as an original song she wrote for the benefit.\n\nOther performers included: the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Katy Perry, No Doubt, Earth Wind & Fire, Dr. Dre, Joni Mitchell, Alanis Morissette, Stevie Nicks, Anderson .Paak, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Mike Campbell and Olivia Rodrigo. Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear, the surviving members of the band Nirvana, also made a surprise appearance, performing some of the band\u2019s songs with St. Vincent, Kim Gordon, Joan Jett and Grohl\u2019s daughter, Violet.\n\nThe wildfires, fueled by powerful winds and dry conditions, erupted the second week of January, killing at least 29 people and destroying entire neighborhoods and blocks. Many who took the stage paid homage to L.A., thanking first responders and highlighting the city\u2019s resilience in the aftermath of the fires.\u201cI think that this is just such a beautiful reflection of what music does, is bring people together in this way,\u201d said performer Gracie Abrams, who grew up in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which was among the areas that were hit hardest by the natural disasters. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just inspired by all of you in this community, and I love Los Angeles very much.\u201d\n\nMusic mogul Irving Azoff and his wife, Shelli, pulled together FireAid in the days after the fires broke out, working in conjunction with Live Nation and the Los Angeles Clippers, according to the FireAid website. Azoff, the former CEO of Ticketmaster and a giant in the music industry, told The Wrap that he and fellow organizers managed to wrangle 25 streaming partners for the concert, which made it easy for those not in L.A. to follow along from home.\n\nOne hundred percent of the proceeds from the concert will go toward fire relief efforts, organizers said. Steve Ballmer, who owns the Clippers, and his wife, Connie, pledged to match every donation made.\n\n\u201cThis has been a horrible scary time,\" said Lady Gaga, who closed the benefit concert. \"But during these times, I feel like people come together and we see how much we need each other. And I want to always remember us just like this.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the lineup of artists, the event brought to the stage a mix of speakers, including firefighters and people who lost their homes in the fires. Among them was 10-year-old Grayson Roberts, from Altadena, whose family lost everything.\n\n\u201cWhen life gives you lemons or burnt houses, you make lemonade,\u201d Grayson told a cheering crowd with a smile on his face.",

That means thieves are trying to circumvent fraud protection services like ACH Block and ACH Block and Filter. By using a Company ID you know and trust, they\u2019re trying to sneak their fraudulent transactions into the list of trusted transactions normally allowed through.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing to protect you.\n\nTo combat this, we\u2019ve temporarily changed the rule clients have in place to allow Intuit transactions to go through. For now, every transaction using an Intuit ID will be reported as an exception, meaning clients will have the opportunity to review them before they\u2019re paid to ensure they\u2019re legitimate.\n\nWe\u2019re also working with the bank where these transactions originated to get to the bottom of the issue and attempt to recover any funds that went through before this was caught.\n\nWhat you can do to protect yourself.\n\nUse ACH Block and Filter or ACH Block to prevent unwanted transactions.\n\nCarefully review all ACH exceptions and immediately report any questionable transactions to your local treasury team.\n\nCarefully review the maximum limits on ACH rules and set mindful limits when creating allow rules. Don\u2019t automatically allow transactions that are higher than what you can afford to lose to a thief.\n\nFraud protection services like Positive Pay, ACH Block and Filter, Check Block and others are terrific tools to protect your company from thieves. They are not a replacement for human vigilance, though. Thieves keep getting more sophisticated, and we must never let our guard down, even with built-in protection for our transaction accounts.\n\nIt is critically important to carefully review transactions before they are entered and if they come back as exceptions. If you ever have concerns about any transaction, immediately call your local treasury team. They can help you determine its legitimacy and take quick action if it might be fraud.\n\nWorking together, we can keep you and your business safe.

Email Comments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nCasey\u2019s department runs the state filing software WisTax, which links with the IRS Direct File website.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a prompt that\u2019ll ask you, would you like to file your state taxes?\u201d said Jennifer Bacon, director of communications for the department. \u201cAnd you just click a button, and because you\u2019ve already entered Wisconsin information, it will automatically take you to WisTax.\u201d\n\nThe website also tells you which tax credits you\u2019re eligible for and lets you choose between them, Casey explained.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really important, because too often when people file returns, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re eligible for, so they may miss something,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2021, 20 percent of eligible Wisconsinites didn\u2019t claim the Earned Income Tax Credit, a tax break for people with low-to-moderate incomes.\n\nNot all taxpayers are eligible for Direct File. Those who are ineligible include people earning over $200,000 a year and those claiming itemized deductions. Filers can check their eligibility at directfile.irs.gov.\n\nOne opponent of the program has been for-profit tax filing software provider TurboTax and its parent company Intuit. Investigative news outlet ProPublica reported in 2019 that the company spent years lobbying Congress against creating a free, direct tax filing service.\n\nIntuit\u2019s stock plunged in June after the IRS announced it was making Direct File \u2014 previously a pilot program \u2014 permanent in several participating states. It fell again in November after The Washington Post reported on Elon Musk\u2019s interest in making a tax filing app as part of his federal Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE.\n\nBacon said Direct File has been going smoothly since it opened Monday.\n\n\u201cWe have received quite a few WisTax returns through Direct File, and they have been seamless,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re hearing from people that it\u2019s really easy to use.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software have returned -4.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Intuit belongs, has gained 3.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIntuit is expected to post earnings of $2.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.27 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13.8%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.97 indicates a change of +14% from what Intuit is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intuit is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

            "content": "Leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), now officially under the United States Digital Services, Elon Musk has promoted the creation of a mobile app for Americans to file their taxes for free. This would add to the options the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) already offers for free tax filing.\n\nKey Takeaways The DOGE is considering creating a new mobile app for Americans to file their federal taxes for free.\n\nThe IRS already offers three free filing methods for taxes: paper forms, IRS Direct File, and IRS Free File.\n\nThe DOGE discussions have negatively impacted the stocks of popular tax software companies H&R Block and Intuit, the parent company of TurboTax.\n\nWhat Musk\u2019s DOGE Commission Is Considering\n\nDuring a November DOGE meeting, The Washington Post reported that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who has since parted ways with the DOGE efforts, discussed the possibility of creating a mobile app so Americans could file their federal taxes for free. Musk posted on X in November about his desire to simplify the tax code, so this would be a step in that direction.\n\n\n\nHowever, that\u2019s easier said than done. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) consists of more than 4 million words, so creating an app that not only encompasses the entire code but also calculates taxes based on the code is quite an undertaking.\n\n\n\nWhat Are Taxpayers' Options for Tax Preparation?\n\nCurrently, taxpayers have three primary ways of filing taxes: do-it-yourself (DIY), using tax software or hiring a CPA.\n\n\n\nIRS DIY\n\nTaxpayers can choose from three IRS options when doing their own taxes, all of which are free to use:\n\n\n\nPrint, fill out and mail in the tax forms\n\nUse IRS Direct File to file online\n\nUse IRS Free File to file online\n\n\n\nWhile all of these methods are free to use, the Direct File and Free File programs have requirements, so not all taxpayers are eligible to use electronic filing. Also, they can be time-consuming, especially if you have many itemized deductions, complicated investment income, or own a business. When filing yourself, it\u2019s possible you could miss deductions that could save you money, or you may make filing errors that could cost you later.\n\n\n\nUse Tax Software\n\nTaxpayers can use a variety of tax software programs to make tax preparation easier. These include TurboTax, TaxSlayer, H&R Block, and others. Some are free to use but have limitations, while others have paid tiers that offer additional features like live support. These can be pricey, depending on the amount of assistance you need.\n\n\n\nHire a CPA\n\nHiring a CPA to prepare and file taxes is easily the most expensive option. However, if you have many itemized deductions, have complicated investment income or losses, are self-employed, or have additional forms such as schedules for student loan interest, hiring a CPA could save you money in the long run\u2013and land you a bigger refund.\n\n\n\nHow Are The Major Tax Preparation Services Reacting?\n\nFollowing the report of the DOGE\u2019s interest in a mobile app for free tax filing, Intuit and H&R Block suffered sharp drops in their stocks. Intuit stock dropped 5.1%, while H&R Block stock dropped 8.2%.\n\nAt H&R Block, George Agurkis, director of government relations, issued a statement saying the company looks forward to engaging with the incoming administration and DOGE regarding tax administration, according to Yahoo Tech. Intuit CEO Susan Goodarzi told The Verge the company doesn\u2019t \u201clobby against free\u201d and free tax filing is \u201cnot relevant to our business.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDOGE leadership has discussed creating a new mobile app so Americans can file their taxes for free. However, there already are free tax filing options, both through the IRS and by using certain tax preparation software. You should review these options along with available paid options to see which filing method best suits their individual tax needs. Doing so could save money upfront or in the form of a larger refund\u2013or both.",

It will be broadcast and streamed live on Apple Music, Apple TV+, Max, iHeartRadio, KTLA+, Netflix/Tudum, Paramount+, Prime Video, the Amazon Music Channel on Twitch, SiriusXM, Spotify, SoundCloud, Veeps and YouTube. It will also be shown at select AMC Theatre locations in the U.S.\n\nWhere can I get tickets to FireAid?\n\nTickets will go on sale Wednesday at 12 pm PST via Ticketmaster. They start at $99. Both venues and Ticketmaster have waived the fees for the event to ensure all sales benefit FireAid relief efforts.\n\nWill ticketholders get to attend both concerts?\n\nNo. However, Intuit Dome attendees will get to watch the Kia Forum performances on screens inside the venue before their event begins. Kia Forum attendees will get to do the same after their performances conclude.\n\nWhat are some of the other ways the music industry has responded to the fires?\n\nSince the wildfires started, celebrities and entertainment organizations have pledged millions to help those who have been displaced or lost their homes, including a $2.5 million contribution from Beyonc\u00e9 to a newly launched LA Fire Relief Fund created by her charitable foundation, BeyGOOD. Recently, The Weeknd donated $1 million to the LAFD Foundation, GoFundMe\u2019s Wildfire Relief Fund, and LA Regional Food Bank.\n\nThe Recording Academy and MusiCares also launched the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort with a $1 million donation.

( ) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 85% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Intuit.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuit?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Intuit. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intuit's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Intuit. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.5% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.4% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 23 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Intuit\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Intuit Inc.. Insiders own US$4.0b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Intuit. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Intuit has we think you should be aware of.\n\nUltimately the future is most important.

            "content": "Greg Coulombe is hiring the next generation of technologists.\n\nToronto is home to a growing number of global companies, drawn to the city by Canada\u2019s high calibre of engineering talent.\n\nAmong those companies is Intuit, whose products include TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks and Mailchimp.\n\n\u201cWorking at Intuit offers the ability to impact approximately 100 million customers. It\u2019s been 23 years and I still get excited about that.\u201d Greg Coulombe, Intuit\n\nA global company with 18,800 employees and approximately 100 million customers worldwide, Intuit was founded in 1983 and has been in Canada since 1993. Intuit moved into its new Canadian headquarters in Toronto in 2022.\n\nAs Intuit\u2019s Director of Product Development, Tax Foundations, Greg Coulombe oversees a team of local engineers focused on the company\u2019s Canadian tax products, AI adoption, and data innovation.\n\nBetaKit sat down with Coulombe to talk about cultivating innovation, the impact of AI, and the advice he gave his daughter as she completes a computer science degree and potentially pursues a career in tech.\n\nA different mindset\n\nWhen it comes to hiring tech roles, Intuit isn\u2019t just looking for coders. According to Coulombe, it\u2019s looking for creators.\n\nWhile technical skills are tablestakes, he said what sets Intuit\u2019s team apart is their ability to assume an entrepreneurial mindset, which means critically assessing the value and purpose behind their work.\n\n\u201cI would like our technologists to stop and say: \u2018I\u2019m not sure that makes any sense. Why would our customers want this? Why are we doing that?\u2019\u201d Coulombe said.\n\nGreg Coulombe, Intuit\u2019s Director of Product Development, Tax Foundations\n\nInnovation requires intentional culture, especially in large organizations where established processes can stifle creativity. Coulombe knows this tension well. At Intuit, making mistakes aren\u2019t just tolerated, they\u2019re encouraged, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to create a culture where it\u2019s OK to break boundaries and make mistakes,\u201d he said, adding that teams are often encouraged to work cross functionally to break down silos, cut through red tape, and keep things moving.\n\nAccording to Coulombe, a key element of Intuit\u2019s innovation culture is its Global Engineering Days, a bi-annual, five-day, internal \u201ccode-a-thon\u201d where employees from all locations collaborate on self-chosen projects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my favourite two weeks of the year,\u201d Coulombe said. \u201cOn the last day of the event, I get to walk around and see all the amazing innovations. It really creates passion and excitement about what our technologists are going to bring to the table.\u201d\n\nClose to 7,500 participants across 13 Intuit locations in the United States, Canada, Israel, and India participated in the most recent GED. Coulombe noted that over the years, hundreds of GED projects across multiple disciplines have made their way into Intuit products as new features or into the company\u2019s development environment as productivity-enhancing tools.\n\nThe chance to impact millions\n\nAI is messy. It\u2019s powerful, exciting, and frustrating all at once\u2014a tool with incredible potential that refuses to fit neatly into a box. For Coulombe, the challenge lies in navigating that chaos.\n\n\u201cWhat I find challenging and struggle with as a leader and as a technologist is the fundamental uncertainty that AI brings into the system,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we take this cool stuff and make it actually work properly? That\u2019s a very interesting challenge.\u201d\n\nAt Intuit\u2019s Global Engineering Days, employees from all locations collaborate on self-chosen projects over five days.\n\nCoulombe believes the main draw of working at Intuit lies in the opportunity to impact global users of its tax software.\n\n\u201cWorking at Intuit offers the ability to impact approximately 100 million customers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been 23 years and I still get excited about that. It comes with a lot of responsibility, which is scary sometimes, but the potential to impact so many people\u2019s lives is really cool. Where can you impact 100 million people with the work that you do? That\u2019s rare.\u201d\n\nLetting the builders build\n\nMany companies hire senior engineers for their management skills. At Intuit, the approach is different, according to Coulombe. Senior engineers are encouraged to spend less time managing and more time building.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want them to be leaders, but once they progress as an engineer, they could be doing more people facilitation and start to step away from the technology,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re strategically trying to pivot back to having our most valuable technical contributors doing more of the technical work and leading by example. We have managers. Let the builders build.\u201d\n\nTech\u2019s next generation is levelling up\n\nThe expectations for new graduates entering the tech industry have skyrocketed. Coulombe explained that a computer science degree is no longer enough to stand out. Companies now expect candidates to bring tangible experience to the table\u2014whether through internships, open-source contributions, or personal projects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite humbling to see how high the current expectations are for interns and new grads,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies expect them to have done material work. I think internships are critical because they build that valuable experience. You have to be working with a professor, making open source contributions or working on personal projects to distinguish yourself from the rank and file. It\u2019s a very competitive market.\u201d\n\nCoulombe has seen this shift in expectations firsthand through his daughter, a computer science student who initially resisted his advice to get involved outside the classroom.\n\n\u201cI connected her to some recruiters and they told her the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe came back to me and said, \u2018You know, Dad, I think I should actually work on some side projects.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith expectations higher than ever, Coulombe believes that today\u2019s graduates are rising to the challenge.\n\n\u201cOverall, I think the calibre of incoming talent that we have now is just incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I compared myself 25 years ago to the people coming in now, I wouldn\u2019t get the job.\u201d\n\nPRESENTED BY\n\nExplore open roles and opportunities on Intuit Canada\u2019s career site.\n\nAll photos provided by Intuit.",

They launched into \"Breed,\" \"School\" and \"Territorial Pissings\" respectively, inspired and unexpected choices.\n\nDrummer Dave Grohl's daughter, Violet, then emerged on stage for \"All Apologies.\"\n\nCloser Lady Gaga, after powering through the Oscar-award winning \"Shallow\" and \"Always Remember Us This Way\" from \"A Star Is Born,\" played a new song on the piano. \"It's just for tonight, it's just for you,\" she said of the song she wrote with fianc\u00e9 businessman Michael Polansky. \"Time is a healer.\"\n\n\"All I need is time,\" she sang in the folk-y pop chorus. \"To heal my broken wings and then I'll soar.\"\n\nGreen Day kicked off the massive show by launching into \"Last Night on Earth\" at the Kia Forum and were soon joined by Billie Eilish for the first surprise of the night. The lyrics are surprisingly astute: \"If I lose everything in the fire / I'm sending all my love to you.\"\n\nAfter their set, Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong hugged actor Billy Crystal, who was there to welcome to the crowd at the Kia Forum.\n\n\"Our goal is simple tonight, to spend more money than the Dodgers spent on free agents,\" he joked. He told the audience U2 offered the first big donation of the night: $1 million dollars.\n\nCrystal said he was wearing the clothes he had on when he evacuated. He lost his home in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood that he lived in for 46 years.\n\nSoCal in the building\n\nIs there any band more Southern California in spirit and geography than the Red Hot Chili Peppers? Bassist Flea did a handstand on stage wearing only a Speedo before they launched into one of their countless odes to the state: \"Dani California,\" \"Californication\" and \"Under the Bridge.\"\n\nThe first true-blue Los Angeles moment came from a surprise performance by Dr. Dre. The progenitor of West Coast hip-hop tackled \"Still D.R.E.\" with Anderson .Paak and Sheila E. before pivoting to Tupac and Dre's classic \"California Love.\"\n\nIt was followed by the figurehead of Laurel Canyon folk, a moving set of \"Both Sides Now\" by Joni Mitchell.\n\nLater in the night, the recently reunited, Orange Country ska punk legends No Doubt launched into \"I'm Just a Girl,\" \"Don't Speak\" and \"Spiderwebs,\" led by frontwoman Gwen Stefani.\n\nKaty Perry was joined by the Pasadena Chorale for \"Rise\" before launching into \"Roar\" and \"California Gurls.\" She paraded across the stage with the California state flag in hand.\n\nAnd Eilish and her brother Finneas, who've called Los Angeles home for their entire lives, performed beautiful acoustic versions of her recent hits \"Wildflower,\" \"The Greatest\" and \"Birds of a Feather.\"\n\nTwo venues, one huge concert\n\nFireAid spread its performances between two venues, the Kia Forum and Intuit Dome, providing a near seamless stream of music for nearly six hours. Behind early performances, images of firefighters and the devastation brought forth by the fires appeared on screen.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo, Stevie Wonder, Sting and Pink provided memorable sets.\n\nStevie Nicks did \"Edge of Seventeen,\" \"Stand Back\" and \"Landslide,\" and told the story of evacuating her Pacific Palisades home that miraculously did not burn down. Her home is mostly wood, built in 1938, and she theorized its loss would have destroyed the whole street.\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire did a medley of their biggest hits: \"That's the Way of the World,\" \"Shining Star\" and \"September.\" The Black Crowes backed up John Fogerty for \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\" Then the band was joined by Slash.\n\nLil Baby offered a rare hip-hop break in the night of mostly pop and rock, with his hits \"So Sorry\" and \"Emotionally Scarred.\"\n\nTate McRae performed her 2020 cut \"You Broke Me First\" and a cover of Crowded House's \"Don't Dream It's Over.\" Jelly Roll brought country music to the event, performing his hit \"I Am Not Okay\" and a cover of Bob Seger's \"Hollywood Nights\" with Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker.\n\nMusic mixed with stories of fire's toll\n\nBetween sets, survivors telling stories of losing their homes were broadcast throughout the arena, both in person and in video packages.\n\nNon-celebrities brought heart. The Williams family, including four daughters and their mother, took the stage and discussed losing four homes in Altadena, California. They introduced the folk rock band Dawes, whose members also were directly affected by the Eaton fire.\n\nDawes' Taylor Goldsmith lost a portion of the Altadena house he shares with actor-singer Mandy Moore and his home recording studio and instruments were destroyed. Goldsmith's brother and bandmate, Griffin Goldsmith, and his pregnant wife also lost their home in the fire.\n\nSpirits were high. \"We're appreciative of this moment. I hope people remember this concert forever,\" said Scott Jones, 54, who brought his daughter to the concert at the Kia Forum. The Los Angeles-resident and his daughter wore black T-shirts with \"First Responders\" written across their chests.\n\n\"I hope some of the firefighters who are able to attend can come and decompress a little,\" Jones said. \"They needed it. I'm supportive of what they have done for this city.\"\n\nDonations are the focus\n\nThroughout the show, viewers and attendees were encouraged to donate via FireAidLA.org.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie pledged to match all donations made during the live broadcast, doubling the proceeds. Crystal noted that because of their announcement, U2's million dollar donation was worth twice that amount.\n\nAll of the proceeds will go to those affected. A 501(c)(3) was set up, and contributions to FireAid will be distributed under the Annenberg Foundation, which with FireAid has assembled a small committee to advise.",

While millions rely on refunds to cover essentials, younger generations and the self-employed report feeling overwhelmed by the complexities of filing taxes.\n\nHalf of millennials depend on their refunds to make ends meet, often citing maxed-out credit cards (26%) and the need to pay down high-interest debt (23%).

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nWhy is filing so stressful for Gen Z and self-employed Americans?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nFor Gen Z taxpayers, filing taxes sparks fear and procrastination. 26% avoid filing because they don\u2019t want to know how much they owe, while 25% believe filing late reduces their chances of being audited.\n\nMany also worry about mistakes, with 22% fearing tax fraud and 16% concerned about missing out on refunds due to errors.\n\nFor the self-employed, the stress stems from the complexities of their finances. 44% delay filing because it takes time to gather necessary information, and 18% worry about paying their tax bills on time.\n\nWhat about Americans who owe the IRS?\n\nNot everyone will receive a refund this tax season. Nearly 49% of taxpayers expect to owe the IRS, and 27% are worried about affording their tax bill. Among Gen Z, 40% anticipate taking on new debt to pay taxes.\n\nAdditionally, nearly 24% of taxpayers expect their refunds to be withheld due to delinquent federal debts, such as student loans or child support. This issue disproportionately impacts 35% of Gen Z and 34% of millennials.",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Point of Sale Market Report 2024\" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe point of sale market size is expected to see rapid growth in the next few years, growing to $92.62 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.9%. The projected growth in the forecast period is driven by several factors, including the expansion of e-commerce and omnichannel retailing, evolving regulatory changes and compliance requirements, growth in the retail and hospitality sectors, a heightened emphasis on security and fraud prevention, and a rise in contactless payment methods.\n\nKey trends anticipated during this period include greater adoption of near-field communication (NFC) and quick response (QR) code payments, an increase in tablet and smartphone-based POS solutions, the implementation of advanced encryption and fraud detection technologies, the use of fingerprint and facial recognition, and the exploration of blockchain technology for secure, transparent, and efficient transaction processing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growing adoption of contactless payments is expected to drive the expansion of the point of sale (POS) market. Contactless payments are a secure transaction method where consumers pay by simply tapping or waving a payment-enabled card, smartphone, or wearable device near a compatible payment terminal, eliminating the need for physical contact. The increased use of contactless payments is fueled by factors such as convenience, speed, improved security features, widespread smartphone and wearable device usage, and a heightened focus on hygiene, especially in the post-pandemic era. POS systems support the adoption of contactless payments by enabling merchants to process quick, secure transactions through NFC-enabled devices, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and encouraging wider use. For example, in January 2024, the European Central Bank reported that contactless card payments rose by 24.3% in the first half of 2023, reaching 20.9 billion transactions, with the total value increasing by 25.9% to \u20ac0.5 trillion ($545.27 billion). This surge in contactless payments is propelling the growth of the POS market.\n\n\n\nLeading companies in the POS market are focusing on developing innovative open banking payment solutions to offer merchants a cost-effective and efficient payment method that enhances customer convenience. Open banking payment solutions allow third-party providers to securely access a user's bank account information to initiate payments or offer financial services, using open APIs for improved transparency and efficiency. For instance, in February 2024, Acquired Limited, a UK-based provider of payment infrastructure and solutions, collaborated with MultiPay Global Solutions, a UK-based payments technology firm, to introduce Pay by Bank for POS. This platform facilitates direct bank payments via QR codes, eliminating interchange and scheme fees for merchants and providing immediate access to funds. Customers benefit from a seamless payment experience without needing additional app downloads, ensuring quick and hassle-free transactions.\n\n\n\nIn September 2023, Buckaroo, a Netherlands-based payment service provider, merged with SEPAY for an undisclosed amount. The merger aims to enhance omnichannel payment solutions, providing customers with a wide range of payment terminals and services for both online and in-store transactions, thus offering greater convenience and flexibility. SEPAY is a Netherlands-based provider of electronic payment services, including POS payment services.\n\n\n\nMajor companies operating in the point of sale market are HP, Panasonic, Oracle, Fujitsu, Salesforce, PayPal, Block, Intuit, Shopify, NCR Voyix, Toast, Casio Computer Co., Ingenico Group, PAX Global Technology, Lightspeed Commerce, Elo Touch Solutions, TouchBistro, Miva, GOFRUGAL, Squirrel Systems, Erply, Poster POS, Nomia and Bindo Labs.\n\n\n\nThis report focuses on point of sale market which is experiencing strong growth.

This past weekend, he faced a set of spectators that he'd never encountered: the occupants of an infamous section called \"The Wall.\"\n\nAd\n\nThis section of the Intuit Dome, which cost $2 billion, per Forbes, is meant to generate the strongest reaction in favor of the LA Clippers and against the team's opponents. When the Clippers squared off against the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday in Inglewood, California, Antetokounmpo had to deal with a tactic that \"The Wall\" had in store for his first Intuit Dome visit.\n\nFans held signs and counted down as the nine-time All-Star took his shots. This one sequence had them scream one to 14 as Antetokounmpo made the basket:\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nAd\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nThe \"Greek Freak\" has been accused of taking an unusually long time to get his in-game free throws up. For the past few years, opposing fanbases have taken pleasure in timing Antetokounmpo's free throw attempts.\n\nFans, players and even commentators have counted down the Bucks forward's attempts, which are sometimes followed by 10-second free throw violation calls by refs. During Game 5 of the 2021 NBA Finals, a Phoenix Suns fan counted down an Antetokounmpo free throw attempt using $100 bills.\n\nAd\n\nAd\n\nAs for the Clippers fans seated in \"The Wall,\" they didn't garner much success in disrupting Antetokounmpo's rhythm for much of the game. The face of the Milwaukee franchise ended up making 12 of his 15 free throws en route to a 36-point performance. The Clippers still had the last laugh as they defeated the Bucks 127-117.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo leads all players in fan votes en route to ninth start in All-Star Game\n\nIf there's one stretch in which the \"Greek Freak\" won't be shooting too many free throws, it'll be the 2025 All-Star Game, which will adopt a mini-tournament format for the first time.\n\nAd\n\nTo Antetokounmpo's credit, he led all NBA players in the fan vote. The Bucks superstar finished with 4,435,266 votes, ahead of other iconic players like Jayson Tatum (3,613,835), Nikola Jokic (3,724,344), LeBron James (3,339,907) and Steph Curry (2,342,126).\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nIt's been four years since Antetokounmpo won his first All-Star Game MVP award.

The old rivals: James Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo come face-to-face. There isn\u2019t a secret here that these two former MVPs bring the heat to the floor. It\u2019s a show of who has the last laugh. And for Saturday\u2019s game night at the Intuit Dome, it was the home team, the Clippers who took the win.\n\nA Bucks vs. Clippers game without the Greek Freak and the Beard? Hard to imagine! This rivalry began way back in Giannis\u2019 rookie days. Harden was already an All-Star. But what sparked that first push? We\u2019re still guessing.\n\nMeanwhile, Saturday\u2019s game had a wild twist. Damian Lillard grabbed a rebound and raced down the court. Giannis, the 30-year-old Greek giant, was right ahead, charging forward. Then, out of nowhere, Harden appeared. The Clippers guard had his hands on Giannis\u2019 waist. But Giannis? He made a sharp move\u2014maybe an elbow to the forehead. Before anyone knew it, Harden was down.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nDid Giannis Antetokounmpo get a foul called on him for this? No. It was clearly visible that the 35YO All-Star guard might have flopped. Was it needed in a game that was already in his reach? No. This has triggered the NBA fans who are now calling out James Harden.\n\nJames Harden faces flak for unnecessary \u201cnasty\u201d move with Giannis Antetokounmpo\n\n\u201cA nasty flop, man! Why does Harden do all this?! It hurts his legacy. He\u2019s too great to act like a fool like this \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f,\u201d a fan brutally remarked. Speaking of legacy, James Harden ranks as one of the most celebrated hoopsters in league history. He stands second in line after Stephen Curry in three-point shooting. Even in the game against the Bucks, he dropped a solid 40 points for the Clippers. Looking back at the alleged flop now, it clearly wasn\u2019t needed.\n\nAfter the Academy Awards, the Emmy is one of the most prestigious honors for any actor. But for The Beard? Sounds odd, right? Well, fans believe he deserves an Emmy for his failed attempt to gain an edge by pretending Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2018s elbow hurt him. Someone even commented, \u201cGive that man an Emmy.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nFans are making their demand loud and clear: \u201cThere is no way that touched him right? I need another angle \ud83d\ude02.\u201d Skeptical, they want to confirm whether the 36-point-scoring Greek Freak\u2019s hand actually touched Harden. Despite the years, the once-perennial MVP candidates continue to fuel their rivalry. Therefore, a fresh perspective is crucial for the incident that unfolded at the Intuit Dome.\n\nUSA Today via Reuters Mar 10, 2024; Los Angeles, California, USA; Los Angeles Clippers guard James Harden (1) dribbles the ball between Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis (9) and forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (34) during the second quarter at Crypto.com Arena. Mandatory Credit: Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\u201cYea that wasn\u2019t intentional but it\u2019s funny asf \ud83d\ude2d\u201d someone remarked. Well, it wasn\u2019t intentional of the Bucks stalwart to hit James Harden on his face. Some say there was contact, while others argue there was none. Interestingly enough, Giannis did help his 35-year-old rival get back on his feet after he hit the floor with a big dramatic thump. Funny or not, it was an odd moment that may or may not have been avoided. Who knows?\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cWonder if they\u2019ll fine Harden for flopping\u2026\u201d a fan criticized on X. This isn\u2019t the first time fans have called out James Harden for flopping. In 2023, when he left the Philadelphia 76ers for the Clippers, people labeled him a flopper. In fact, Harden even took offense when Mackenzie Salmon of USA Today Sports asked him a harsh question about it.\n\nThus, Saturday\u2019s showdown added another chapter to the Harden-Giannis saga. The flop debate continues to stir up fans, but no one can deny the drama these two bring to the court. Whether it\u2019s a foul or a flop, the rivalry is far from over. Guess we\u2019ll have to wait for the next encounter to see who really gets the last laugh!",

The personal computer was introduced in 1977 with Apple at the forefront and software suppliers have thrived ever since, enjoying significant revenue.\n\nMicrosoft takes the honor of the biggest supplier on our list but the others generate excellent net income and boast solid market caps as well.

They knew their stellar defense would be tested by one of the best-shooting teams in the NBA, a squad riding a five-game winning streak.\n\nThe Clippers were resolute in the face of those challenges, with James Harden and Norman Powell combining for 73 points in an impressive 127-117 win over Milwaukee on Saturday at the Intuit Dome.\n\n\u201cJust keeping our composure, being down 11 early, fighting back, finding ways to win the game,\u201d Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. \u201c...James was spectacular. He got us off to a good start in that first quarter, late in that first quarter and then in the third and fourth he was huge. Norm was good down the stretch as well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarden scored 17 of his game-high 40 points in the third quarter, his hot shooting helping the Clippers open a one-point lead heading to the fourth. Harden, who scored 11 points in the fourth quarter and finished nine assists, is one of six players in the NBA to have three or more 40-point games this season.\n\n\u201cIt was time to go, time to go,\u201d Harden said. \u201cTime to try to be more assertive in this game, and got it going.\u201d\n\nPowell was on the attack all game, scoring 33 points. It was his eighth game of 30-plus points this season, a career best. He had 14 points in the fourth quarter, helping L.A. pull away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe all stuck together,\u201d Powell said. \u201cUp, down calls. No calls. Whatever it was, nobody was hanging their heads. Everybody was rooting each other on ... and we dug deep. It started defensively.\u201d\n\nKawhi Leonard continued to play limited minutes in his return from a knee injury, scoring 18 points on eight-for-17 shooting in 24 minutes.\n\nAntetokounmpo lived up to the billing of being one of the league\u2019s best players, who entered the game second in scoring (31.3 points) and fifth in rebounding (12.0). He had 36 points and 13 rebounds and went 12 for 15 from the free-throw line.\n\nDamian Lillard had a triple-double with 29 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. He was 16 for 17 from the line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe win capped a 3-2 week for the Clippers (26-19), with their victory over the Bucks (25-18) being the most impressive of the stretch.\n\n\u201cI guess like you guys [in the media] pretty much seen the back-and-forth of the game, staying composed,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cStaying composed with Giannis and Lillard getting to the line. They score the ball very well and easily. And just battling those moments out and coming out of our timeouts and executing.

While Los Angeles Clippers The Milwaukee Bucks will be without Kris Dunn and will travel to the Californian city without Bobby Portis and AJ Green.\n\nClippers Bucks James Harden Damian Lillard Norman powell Andre Jackson Jr. Kawhi Leonard Taurean prince Derrick Jones Jr. Giannis Antetokounmpo Ivica Zubac Brook lopez\n\nClippers Breaking News: Injuries and Form\n\nLos Angeles Clippers They returned to winning ways against the Washington Wizards on Thursday after losing their previous two games against the Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls. Still, they have five wins in the last seven games, which allows them to stay in the fight for fifth place in the Western Conference with Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe Angels have built their success on defense and now they're turning things up a notch: In the last seven games they have returned the best defensive ratio in the entire NBA (97,3) with a wide margin over their closest pursuer, the Oklahoma City Thunder (106,1). Now that Kawhi Leonard is back, the Clippers hope to also be more decisive on offense, where James Harden and Norman Powell have pulled the cart during his absence.\n\nWith the trade deadline approaching, the Clippers are looking to continue their good form and not miss the playoff race. They will also explore the market in order to bring in a backup center who can perform better than the so-far ineffective Mo Bamba.\n\nPlayer to watch: Kawhi Leonard\n\nSince signing his season debut on January 4, Kawhi has played six games, subject to a minutes and rest restriction in back-to-backsHe is still getting his bearings, but his impact on the team has been enormous in the 22,2 minutes he has averaged: The Clippers have been 32,5 points better for every hundred possessions with him on the court. A real outrage.\n\nBucks latest: injuries and form\n\nSince January 6, the Milwaukee Bucks have won eight of the nine games they have played and have won five consecutive games after beating Miami on Thursday Heat at Fiserv Forum. The game against the Pelicans in New Orleans had been called off the day before due to weather conditions.\n\nDoc Rivers' team beat Miami by a comfortable score of 125 to 96. Damian Lillard led the Bucks with a double-double of 29 points and 11 assists, well accompanied by Giannis Antetokounmpo's 25 points and 12 rebounds. Off the bench, Gary Trent Jr. added 21 points to secure his team's victory.\n\nMilwaukee has gone from less to more. In the current month of January they have a record of 8-3 and the fourth best Net Ratings NBAHowever, the Bucks are not satisfied and now land in Los Angeles with the aim of continuing to accumulate victories.\n\nPlayer to watch: Giannis Antetokounmpo\n\nThe Greek international recorded, with 25 points and 12 rebounds, his 14th consecutive double-double in Thursday's win over Miami Heat. In the season overall he has 32 double-doubles, a figure only surpassed by Domantas Sabonis and Karl-Anthony Towns. Pulling the cart at the beginning of the season to reverse his team's poor start has led him to be at full capacity before necessary. And now we have to see who stops him.\n\nClippers vs. Bucks: Head-to-head record\n\nThis will be the first meeting of the season between the two teams. The Milwaukee Bucks have won four consecutive games against the Los Angeles Lakers and dominate the game. head-to-head The Clippers, however, are 73-54 at home against the Milwaukee Bucks over the past 18 seasons. The only teams with a better home record against Milwaukee in that span are New Orleans, Houston and Utah.\n\nClippers vs. Bucks Predictions\n\nGetting Brook Lopez out of the paintBrook remains the team's interior anchor, but at 36 years old he can no longer carry the entire defensive load of the team with the same efficiency as he did in previous seasons. The Clippers will try to force changes so that Lopez can move to the perimeter to defend and thus attack the zone with more confidence.\n\nGreat scope. If there's one thing that both teams have in abundance, it's size and plenty of defensive options to cover different offensive profiles and approaches. It will be very interesting to see how Doc Rivers and Tyronn Lue plan their matchups, and how they try to minimize the impact of Antetokounmpo, Kawhi, Harden and Lillard.\n\nTriple, yes, triple, noThe Bucks are shooting very well from long range in their recent winning streak, with a 41,8% success rateThe problem for them is that the Clippers are defending the opposing three-point line extremely well: They only make 33,8% of the three-pointers that are thrown at them, the second best statistic in the NBA behind the Thunder.\n\nWhere to watch Clippers vs. Bucks\n\nthe match between Los Angeles Clippers and Milwaukee Bucks can be seen in Spain through the NBA League Pass subscription.\n\n(Cover photo by Kiyoshi Mio-Imagn Images)",

            "content": "In an interview with Bloomberg Markets , Wood predicted that Bitcoin would surpass the $1 million mark by the end of the decade. She ascribed the cryptocurrency's increasing value to both growing institutional and its limited supply of only 21 million coins. According to the ARK's manager, BTC has already crossed $108,000 in 2024 and is expected to rise further in the upcoming years. She also highlighted that, in contrast to more conventional assets like gold, Bitcoin is resistant to inflationary pressures. Moreover, Wood emphasized that institutional adoption\u2014especially via Bitcoin ETFs\u2014is increasing the allure of BTC and promoting a wider understanding of its place within the international financial system.\n\nAlthough her funds have gained recognition for their strategies, they have also had a range of outcomes, with some analysts describing them as rollercoaster rides. While creative, market analysts highlight a significant issue with the hedge fund manager's approach: most companies she supports are fairly volatile and come with highly correlated returns. In addition, Wood's portfolio is extremely concentrated, posing a significant risk as gains and losses are magnified. As an illustration, Wood's flagship ARK Innovation ETF, with $6.27 billion under management marked a three-year annualized return of -15.64% and a five-year return of 3.05%. The S&P 500, by contrast, raked in annualized returns of 9.98% over three years and 14.65% over five. According to Morningstar Financial , the ARK Innovation ETF lost 29.9% of its value by the end of the first quarter of 2022. The slide came after the flagship fund saw a 24% drop in 2021, highlighting the risk associated with Wood's full-on growth strategy.\n\nIn an industry known for hedge fund managers who focus on unique strategies, including quantitative trading and value stocks, Cathie Wood and her hedge fund ARK Investment Management set themselves apart by purely focused on buying shares in emerging, innovative companies in fields such as AI, Blockchain Technology, Multi-Omics, Space Exploration, and Energy Storage. The fund saw one of its best years since its launch in 2017, with an impressive 87.4% gain driven by a 1300% increase in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. This performance occurred while the price of Bitcoin hit a record high of $20,000.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Tech Stocks to Sell Now According to Cathie Wood . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stands against the other tech stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, Wood has predicted a surge in startup merger & acquisitions (M&A) under the new Trump administration, which has already taken a number of pro-crypto steps. She cited the expected changes to the Federal Trade Commision (FTC) regulations that may lower regulatory barriers and foster an environment of that is more welcome to private sector transactions. According to Wood:\n\n\u201cRegulatory barriers have been a significant obstacle for M&A activity, but that is likely to change.\u201d\n\nShe went on to say that these changes might open up new liquidity opportunities for venture-backed companies. As companies regain the ability to make acquisitions without stringent regulation, Wood added, there may be a spike in market activity. For startups looking towards growth or exit opportunities in an economic environment, this would be crucial.\n\nIn any case, Cathie Wood is one of the most interesting hedge fund managers to observe in the industry, and much like her peers, she has made significant moves in the third quarter of 2024. For now, however, we will look at the stocks that she has chosen to part ways with.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK portfolio for Q3 2024 and selected the technology stocks where she discarded her stake by at least 30% or more. We have arranged the list in ascending order of the percentage of stake discarded.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA professional tax preparer, using a laptop to complete an income tax return.\n\nIntuit Inc.

(NASDAQ:INTU) enables both individuals and corporations to reach their financial objectives. Among its products are Mailchimp for email marketing, QuickBooks for business accounting, Credit Karma for financial management, and TurboTax for tax preparation.\n\nWith revenue of $3.2 billion, or roughly 17% year-over-year growth, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) showed that the company is resilient to macroeconomic challenges in Q4 2024. Looking ahead, the company expects its overall revenue to grow about 12% annually, which reflects a balanced approach across all of its segments.\n\nIntuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) recently expanded its partnership with leading productivity software provider GetBusy plc. The collaboration adds Intuit ProConnect Tax to the suite of products that integrate with GetBusy's SmartVault, providing a co-branded document management and workflow solution exclusive to ProConnect Tax users.\n\nParnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIntuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) shares fell despite the financial software company posting strong quarterly results. The company\u2019s pricing-dependent long-term guidance concerned investors. However, we continue to believe Intuit\u2019s customer growth and relevant platform will sustain its wide moat and long growth runway.\u201d\n\nOverall INTU ranks 6th on our list of the stocks to sell now according to Cathie Wood. While we acknowledge the potential of INTU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This is exactly what the Hammers Business Network is all about - creating a space for growth, collaboration and innovation, all with the vision of powering prosperity in the West Ham business community.\n\n\u201cThis, combined with the Q&A from Baroness Karren Brady, one of the UK's most successful entrepreneurs, offered a real-life lens into leadership, resilience and success which provided true inspiration for everyone in the room. We look forward to future events and networking opportunities in the months ahead.\u201d\n\nBaroness Karren Brady CBE said: \u201cFirstly let me say how delighted I am to be here and to thank the panel members, I thought it was excellent.

            "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 The Celtics beat the Clippers in a 117-113 overtime thriller that probably had no business going into overtime. But, the main story of the day wasn\u2019t the late game execution, nor the inconsistent defensive effort: it was Jaden Springer.\n\nYes, you heard that right \u2014 the fourth-year guard who has only played double-digit minutes once this entire season was the story on Wednesday night at Intuit Dome, and dozens of reporters crowded around him as he held his first media availability in the locker room. Jayson Tatum heckled him in the background, yelling \u201cYeah, Spring!\u201d and \u201cSpeak up, Spring!\u201d as Jaden Springer fielded questions from an abnormally large press corp.\n\nHere\u2019s what stood out from a wild night at the Intuit Dome.\n\nClippers, Celtics are both shorthanded \u2014 but \u201cit\u2019s the NBA\u201d\n\nIf the Warriors were considered shorthanded on Monday, finding the appropriate word to describe the Clippers\u2019 situation on Saturday night would be tough. The Clippers were without most of their usual rotation \u2014 missing Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Norman Powell, Ivica Zubac, Nicolas Batum, and Kris Dunn on the first night of a back-to-back. Part of the significant injury report was the result of the Clippers being in the middle of a 4-games-in-5-nights schedule that was a result of the NBA rescheduling games that had been delayed due to the California wildfires.\n\nThe reality is that playing such shorthanded teams can be difficult; players have fresh legs and role players are empowered and eager to capitalize on their rare opportunity. And, the Celtics weren\u2019t at full strength, either \u2014 Jrue Holiday (shoulder impingement), Kristaps Porzingis (illness), and Al Horford (left big toe sprain) all sat out.\n\nStill, the Clippers\u2019 performance was an impressive one; Derrick Jones Jr. exploded for 29 points and Kevin Porter Jr. added 26 points, both season highs. And, once again, the Celtics found themselves within a few plays from a significant letdown loss against an inferior opponent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the NBA,\u201d said Jaylen Brown. \u201cThey played well. They hit a lot of shots... I thought they played really well.\u201d\n\nJoe Mazzulla described the preparations for Wednesday\u2019s game as similar to a typical NBA game, despite the significant personnel changes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll plug guys into the system with which they use their other guys,\u201d he said of the Clippers. \u201cAnd so I think it\u2019s just having a clear understanding of [their] tendencies.\u201d\n\nThen, after the overtime victory, when pressed on why the game was so close after the game despite the Clippers being down six players, Mazzulla emphasized that there was no expectation that the game was going to be easy.\n\nJoe Mazzulla asked about the Clippers being down 4 starters:\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the first question should be \u2014 why would we assume that it was going to be an easy game? [That\u2019s] discrediting a championship head coach and a group of guys that are really, really good.\u201d pic.twitter.com/eBUAaTcX9l \u2014 Noa Dalzell (@NoaDalzell) January 23, 2025\n\n\u201cThe game went the way it was supposed to go,\u201d Mazzulla said. \u201cThat\u2019s a championship head coach, those guys are great players \u2014 been in the league a long time, a lot of them, and they\u2019ve delivered.\u201d\n\nCeltics-Clippers was the unequivocal Jaden Springer game\n\nOnce it became apparent that the shorthanded Clippers were going to put up a fight, the Celtics needed someone to step up on the defensive end. Kevin Porter Jr. was getting whatever he wanted offensively, and the usual match-ups the Celtics were throwing at him weren\u2019t effective (after the game, Jaylen Brown revealed he was limited by an ankle sprain he suffered in the second quarter).\n\nEnter Jaden Springer.\n\nSpringer has been used sparingly since the Celtics traded for him last winter. But, with the game at risk of slipping away, and Porter Jr. dominating for the Clippers, Joe Mazzulla called his name, and he delivered. He racked up 4 steals in the second half and was responsible for a few other Clippers\u2019 turnovers, forcing an out-of-bounds violation and travel during his stint.\n\nJaden Springer is having a huge defensive impact pic.twitter.com/MDcReEKAsx \u2014 Noa Dalzell (@NoaDalzell) January 23, 2025\n\nFor Springer, the results of his defensive efforts were immediately evident.\n\n\u201cYou can see it,\u201d Springer said. \u201cThey stop drawing the plays for him [Porter Jr.] a little bit... you can read the body language. He\u2019s frustrated.\u201d\n\nStill, his most unexpected contribution might have been on the offensive end. Springer \u2014 a 21.1% career three-point shooter \u2014 hit two of six three-point attempts, a performance that was punctuated by a clutch corner three with 34 seconds left in overtime that gave the Celtics a 5-point lead.\n\nJaden Springer heckled by Jayson Tatum who yelled \u201cspeak up!\u201d during his locker room media availability \u2014 with about 30 reporters crowded around him as he talks about how he knows when he\u2019s impacting the opponents pic.twitter.com/4XvoiDptL5 \u2014 Noa Dalzell (@NoaDalzell) January 23, 2025\n\nSpringer credited Jayson Tatum for trusting him.\n\n\u201cWe train for this every day,\u201d Springer said. \u201cWe got a good staff, we\u2019re working on it every day, game situations. We do the best we can to prepare for moments like this \u2014 staying ready.\u201d\n\nSpringer said that hitting the three in front of James Harden \u2014 a former teammate of his on the Philadelphia 76ers \u2014 made the moment even more rewarding.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my dawg.\u201d\n\nJaylen Brown deemed the victory \u2018a great Jaden Springer game.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a testament to him and his work ethic,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe got his name called, defensively we weren\u2019t at our best... Jaden came in, hawked the ball, gave us some energy on defense, and helped us get a win.\u201d\n\nSam Hauser starts (and shines) as Jrue Holiday sits\n\nHauser started in place of Jrue Holiday, who missed Wednesday\u2019s game with a right shoulder impingement \u2014 and, he capitalized on the increased opportunity, hitting his first 3 three-pointers and finishing the game with 15 points on 5 of 7 three-point shooting.\n\nAt shootaround Wednesday, Hauser was asked about whether he feels like his number of shot attempts is a good indicator of how good the Celtics\u2019 ball movement is that night and noted it\u2019s not just his attempts that are indicative of the team's passing.\n\n\u201cWhen the ball is moving, everyone\u2019s getting shots, everyone\u2019s getting good looks,\u201d Hauser said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we\u2019re at our best because everyone has been contributing in different ways to this team. When the ball is moving, everybody is able to showcase what they bring to the table and how they can help our team.\u201d\n\nWell, Wednesday night sure was another good ball movement game for the Celtics \u2014 they racked up 33 assists, and it just so happened to be that Hauser recorded his best three-point shooting game of the season.\n\nBaylor Scheierman, Jordan Walsh earn first-quarter minutes\n\nFresh off of a very productive garbage time stint against the Warriors, Jordan Walsh and Baylor Scheierman both earned rare first-quarter minutes against the Clippers.\n\nWalsh had a few highlight plays in the first half. He hit a corner three-pointer \u2014 his only attempt of the night \u2014 and grabbed an offensive rebound that led to a Payton Pritchard three. But, Mazzulla subbed him out in favor of Jaden Springer in the second half.\n\nJordan Walsh looks so much more confident shooting and the results have been great pic.twitter.com/wnbZlXOtgd \u2014 Noa Dalzell (@NoaDalzell) January 23, 2025\n\nIntuit Arena is shiny and innovative \u2014 but doesn\u2019t ultimately deliver its intended vision\n\nFrom the moment one enters Intuit Arena, it\u2019s evident that it is vastly different from the average NBA arena. The newly constructed arena boasts a famous \u201cwall\u201d of Clippers fans in front of the baseline and relies on innovative technology and sound effects. There were a couple of fun wrinkles like no lines for the bathroom, T-shirt tosses that reached the balcony, and indoor fireworks during the national anthem.\n\nIntuit Dome is pretty cool can\u2019t lie pic.twitter.com/aqMQCSC37h \u2014 Noa Dalzell (@NoaDalzell) January 23, 2025\n\nBut, ultimately, Intuit Arena was one of the emptiest arenas I\u2019ve visited this season, and the majority of the fans in the building donned Celtics green. No amount of cool features, sound effects, and cutting-edge technology can make up for the sheer lack of authentic fans present inside the gymnasium.\n\nJaylen Brown alluded to the arena being empty when asked about the Intuit Dome experience after the game.\n\n\u201cIt was loud \u2014 the way they built it, the structure of it, it\u2019s more on top of you, and I think that has a lot to do with the sound engineering,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause there wasn\u2019t that many people in there \u2014 but it sounded like there was.\u201d\n\nCredit to Clippers owner Steve Ballmer for trying his best to revive a somewhat anemic fandom, and for doing so in creative fashion. But it\u2019s probably going to take some extended stretches of winning for the Clippers fanbase to have a real presence here, especially against a team with a fanbase that travels as well as the Celtics. By the end of the night, the arena sounded more like a Celtics home game than an away game.\n\nVery cool arena \u2014 but also a very empty arena here in LA pic.twitter.com/betSZMjpeC \u2014 Noa Dalzell (@NoaDalzell) January 23, 2025\n\nNext Up: Celtics-Lakers\n\nThe Celtics are now 2-0 on their Western Conference road trip \u2014 and are back in action 10 pm ET against the Lakers. Al Horford and Kristaps Porzingis should both be back in the lineup on the second night of a back-to-back; whether Jrue Holiday is back in the lineup remains to be seen. After LA, the Celtics will close out the road trip against the Mavericks on Saturday night before returning home to Boston.",

            "content": "Building extensible capabilities to elevate developer experience and seamlessly adapt to customers' changing needs have been critical transformations in Intuit's platform journey.\n\nOver the years, research has proved that innovation is the origin of new value creation and developed from customer centricity. This reflects the fact that when Scott Cook founded Intuit, he prioritized one value above all else: customer obsession. It\u2019s about knowing how quickly teams can understand and deliver what the customer wants.\n\nIn the last four years, the company\u2019s release velocity increased by 8x. Today, thanks to the GenAI-powered workforce, development teams at Intuit are revolutionizing the way they work internally, underpinned by investments in AI and data.\n\nOn top of it, it\u2019s our relentless drive to ask \u2018what next?\u2019 and take bold action that keeps us ahead of the game. I joined Intuit in India straight out of college in 2008, and am now a distinguished software engineer leading technology for Intuit Enterprise Suite.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to share through the lens of my decades-long journey at Intuit in India. My experiences and the teams\u2019 contributions in making QuickBooks available to different geographies\u2014all the while driving platform innovation\u2014has changed the world for Intuit developers and customers.\n\nAn exciting time, enabling QuickBooks for the world\n\nIn 2015, as part of the global expansion for QuickBooks Online, I was assigned the project of transforming the technology to be global ready. While the capabilities that support QuickBooks were primarily designed for U.S. customers, expanding to the UK, Canada, and Australia took several quarters.\n\nIt was a concerted effort to prioritize global considerations in the QuickBooks\u2019 design process. I collaborated closely with product managers and development teams across different regions to identify and establish the foundational elements that would make QuickBooks globally adaptable. We structured the approach around three key elements\u2014language proficiency, product customization, and business logic customization. We also defined and combined several configurations to implement region-specific changes in the product.\n\nThe turning point for QuickBooks is when we identified recurring patterns in customization processes related to setup, business logic, reporting, and tax compliance. By externalizing these components and establishing a configuration infrastructure, we enabled developers, product managers, and compliance experts to create and manage region-specific configurations. This approach significantly expedited the launch of new regions, and improved the speed of implementing changes in existing markets.\n\nThis also led to the global-by-design manifesto that each developer who builds new capabilities needs to follow to ensure that the platform is ready to unlock newer business opportunities. In a span of six months, the first shift in our innovation\u2014variability platform\u2014led to faster rollout of new reporting, compliance, and setup requirements for multiple regions. Additionally, this allowed us to promptly test the product market fit for new countries. We expedited the rollout of changes across eight global regions\u2014and a core enabler for making some of these shifts happen was Intuit architecture.\n\nZoom in on modernizing the Intuit architecture\n\nOver the past few years, modernizing the Intuit architecture has become important for product development teams across the company. I\u2019ve been fortunate to witness and participate in the company\u2019s AI-driven expert platform journey. Our services transformation began with converting siloed capabilities into a service-oriented foundational architecture, allowing for simple registration, discovery, and integration of services into the system\u2014and democratization of data, which led to the development of personalized smart products for our customers, while increasing productivity for internal data consumers.\n\nThe Intuit City Map provides a hierarchical structure of capabilities tailored for customer value. It makes it easier for developers to identify capabilities in a way that is scalable and customizable, and from which the business also derives value. They significantly accelerate the speed of innovation.\n\nThe idea is to eliminate clones. It serves teams to have independent access, enabling faster and more autonomous performance. We have a central service registry that serves as an all-encompassing hub for developers to access the required capabilities easily and efficiently\u2014simplifying their experience. Today, they are able to make requests, such as invoicing or reporting, by simply onboarding, discovering the capability they require, and delivering value.\n\nAn equally important part of what the teams are building is self-serve\u2014a clear outcome of the developer platform. It\u2019s not just about building a capability and making it available but ensuring that it is easily consumable by other teams.\n\nI look at it as a pyramid. We develop a capability, and then mature it to accelerate its value. While the initial phase of building capabilities takes time, enhancing self-service options can help teams understand the maturity of those capabilities. The resulting effect is that teams are exceptionally productive from day one.\n\nI\u2019m especially proud that we won the Scott Cook award in November 2023 for building the reporting capability to enable our customers to make faster business decisions across multiple Intuit products. This is a company-recognized accolade awarded to employees who drive innovation.\n\nOn a high-level, the changing requirements of customers across our products indicated a need for more flexible reporting options, including the ability to create custom reports and consolidate all their data in one location. Although we had several reporting solutions available, we developed a new one from scratch that not only meets current needs but is also designed to adapt for future requirements.\n\nIt was a challenging process. We had to establish a suitable data infrastructure, select the appropriate horizontally sharded data store, and develop a new engine capable of processing and analyzing data efficiently. It was done to deliver an experience that scales across several form factors and companies with large amounts of data.\n\nWe continually worked with our customers to validate what we were building and address their needs. Additionally, each component of the platform was designed in a loosely coupled way so that different product teams could also integrate and leverage the same solution for their products.\n\nAs a result, several reporting requests are being served every day by the capability\u2014crunching hundreds of TBs of data across QuickBooks Online, Virtual Expert Platform and Expert Hiring. Every product leverages the self-serve infrastructure to manage data ingestion, curate data models, author reports and insights.\n\nStrategic thinking 2.0\n\nAt the heart of Intuit\u2019s self-serve developer portal is to think how teams will utilize and consume capabilities. The idea is to build a recipe, and not a dish.\n\nThe questions that I often ask my team:\n\nCan the focus be on building capabilities that are ready to evolve from a customer perspective?\n\nCan we design the capability with a multi-year focus?\n\nAre our capabilities extensible to meet the future needs of our customers ?\n\nWhat makes a developer platform stand out are its core ingredients. By building APIs and ensuring that they are accessible to more people allows for wider usage and increased value derived from the platform\u2014enhancing overall developer productivity and experience.\n\nOur commitment to precision, with clean data and AI\n\nOur efforts to improve developer experiences with clean data initiatives have paved the way for growth. We leverage capabilities and utilize clean, error-free data, while collaborating with AWS to develop scalable solutions that adapt to our evolving needs.\n\nWith that, AI has made our innovations exceptionally robust. An example is Intuit Assist for QuickBooks, a GenAI-powered financial assistant, available on the QuickBooks platform. It provides significant advantages to our customers, offering a \u201cdone for you\u201d experience.\n\nAmongst many small businesses, Kim Cross, owner of Zhi Bath & Body, who became an Intuit Assist for QuickBooks customer during the beta launch, says \u201cI was spending the majority of my time doing manual, administrative tasks that didn\u2019t allow me to do what I got in business to do. When I started using QuickBooks Online, I loved how it automatically generated reports for me and helped me track my goals and growth. But the addition of Intuit Assist has truly made an impact on the time and effort I have to spend completing manual tasks like creating estimates and invoices.\u201d That said, devoting our resources to self-serve capabilities to expedite product delivery without compromising on quality always leads us to customer-driven innovations.\n\nAll in all, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to look at different tech shifts at Intuit. Today, I\u2019m eager to further chart my course in the company\u2014especially with the recent development of Intuit Enterprise Suite\u2014an exciting frontier for customers.\n\nHere at Intuit, we\u2019re all about taking care of our teams and making sure everyone is part of our journey to the top. Whether you\u2019re fresh out of school or a seasoned engineer, each day brings opportunities for growth, learning, and reaching new heights. Come join us and see for yourself.",

            "content": "Intuit revolutionized the landscape of Fintech (Financial Technology) mobility, fundamentally transforming how businesses track and manage their finances. At the forefront of this innovation stands Pranay Airan, a seasoned technologist with 14 years of experience. His long-held passion for technology and software development has shaped many groundbreaking advancements in Fintech, resulting in multiple patents that solved critical challenges in mobile technology.\n\nOne of Airan's most significant accomplishments is his work on mileage tracking, the process of logging distances driven for tax deduction or reimbursement purposes. Mileage tracking is vital for small businesses, freelancers, and self-employed individuals to accurately track business-related travel so they not only save time but also adhere to tax regulations.\n\nThe Beginnings of a Stellar Career\n\nAfter graduating from college, Airan started out as a research engineer at Siemens, where he discovered a new career trajectory. \"A pivotal moment in my career was during my tenure at Siemens. Working on interfacing home automation systems with mobile devices showed me the transformative potential of mobile technology in everyday life. This experience solidified my decision to focus on mobile app development,\" Airan explains.\n\nThis change in focus led Airan to a new role at the business software company Intuit. Over the next eight years, he worked on various Fintech and small business mobile products, including TurboTax, QuickBooks Self-Employed (QBSE), and QuickBooks Mobile.\n\nA Pivotal Invention\n\nWhile at Intuit, Airan served as a co-inventor of the Battery Efficient Automatic Mileage Tracking patent, which targeted the problem of accurate, automatic mileage tracking without draining the battery. This was a common complaint among consumers who needed accurate business data for tax deductions or reimbursement purposes.\n\nCorrectly logging business-related travel by small businesses, freelancers, and self-employed professionals is essential for tax regulations and compliance issues. Fintech apps like QBSE are valuable tools for automating mileage tracking for work and streamlining tax reporting. This eliminates the need to keep logs in physical notebooks and/or spreadsheets and the possibility of losing paperwork. Inaccurate reporting and missing deductions cause financial losses for freelancers, small businesses, and the self-employed.\n\nThe QBSE app aims to eliminate paperwork dependency, with the mileage tracker being one of its key features. However, battery drain was a significant limitation of GPS-based tracking applications. The problem Airan and his team faced was that traditional GPS-based mileage apps depleted batteries very quickly, making them difficult to depend on, especially for long-term use. Many consumers stopped using the apps because of this issue, which worked counter to the purpose of the QuickBooks Self-Employed app. Additionally, many small businesses, freelancers, and self-employed professionals in emerging markets might have connectivity issues that need to be addressed and require solutions that work across platforms such as Android and iOS.\n\nAs the lead inventor of this patented platform, Airan created intelligent algorithms to optimize GPS usage. He also conceptualized and developed the technology at the core of the tracking feature in the QuickBooks Self-Employed app. These algorithms incorporated accelerometer data, which differentiates whether the user is walking or driving to enhance accuracy based on movement patterns.\n\nThe app also uses geofencing to detect changes in location without constantly using GPS so as to minimize the device's battery drain. This smart trip detection identifies the start and finish of any journey.\n\nAiran's invention allows for accurate mileage tracking for self-employed people, freelancers, and small businesses without completely draining the battery. After implementing the changes, battery consumption was reduced by about 40% while providing accurate, automatic mileage tracking.\n\nAiran also worked with the iOS teams to ensure consistent platform functionality and a more intuitive app for those with limited technical expertise. The solution was implemented on Android successfully in a global market, including the USA, UK, Australia, and Canada.\n\nOnce integrated into the QBSE app, Airan's product offered a far superior mileage tracking solution than all its competitors and increased customer satisfaction. Subscribers significantly increased from 85,000 in 2016 to an estimated 4.1 million by 2024, and revenue grew eightfold from $100 million in 2016 to approximately $800 million in 2024. The industry responded to this accomplishment by showcasing the development on the Android Developers blog. The feature highlighted the innovative use of Google's Activity Recognition API.\n\nAiran's innovation set a new industry standard for battery efficiency, influencing best practices in mobile app development. In 2016, he received the Scott Cook Innovation Award for significantly contributing to battery efficiency for his mileage tracker. Only five winners were selected from hundreds of Intuit projects, heralding it as one of the best solutions for small businesses and contractors.\n\nRevolutionizing Mobile Technology\n\nSetting new benchmarks for battery efficiency in GPS-based apps stands as one of Airan's most outstanding achievements, fundamentally influencing best practices in mobile development. His work spans two transformative projects that showcase this commitment to excellence.\n\nUnder Airan's leadership, the development of revolutionary GPS optimization algorithms achieved a remarkable 40% reduction in battery consumption. His innovation drove exponential growth in QBSE, significantly expanding the user base and contributing to an increase in revenue between 2016 and 2024. Additionally, he spearheaded the development of groundbreaking solutions for emerging markets grappling with connectivity challenges. His team created sophisticated algorithms that incorporated accelerometer data, enhancing tracking accuracy across different movement patterns. The implementation of innovative geofencing technology revolutionized location-tracking capabilities. These solutions were successfully deployed across major global markets, including the U.S., UK, Australia, and Canada, earning recognition from Tech Crunch as one of the most effective solutions for small businesses and contractors.\n\nThe impact of Airan's innovations extends far beyond technical achievements. His inventions and patents demonstrate an unwavering commitment to making technology accessible to everyone while maximizing its impact on small businesses, freelancers, and self-employed professionals. By placing the user at the center of his designs, Airan consistently bridges gaps in accessibility and usability through his technical expertise.\n\nLooking ahead, Airan continues to push boundaries in mobile app development, particularly in integrating emerging technologies such as AI and machine learning to enhance user experiences. His dedication to contributing to open-source projects and influencing industry best practices reflects his broader vision for the future of technology.",

People with unemployment income, stock sales (including cryptocurrency), income from rental properties, and self-employment income won't qualify.\n\nAlso, it only allows claiming of the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, and the student loan interest deduction.\n\nThe H&R Block Free Edition is available to filers who have W-2 income, qualified retirement distributions, unemployment income, or limited 1099 interest and dividends.\n\nBoth the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit can be claimed with this plan, as well as the education credits and student loan interest deduction \u2014 which is more than TurboTax's free version covers. You can't itemize deductions, but that's typical of both tax providers' free plans.\n\nOne other feature that's free with the online versions of TurboTax and H&R Block is e-file.\n\nE-filing saves you a stamp and ensures that your return won't get lost in the mail. If you're getting a refund, selecting direct deposit when you e-file will help the IRS process your payment more quickly. Plus, e-filing ensures your information goes to the IRS exactly as you intended.\n\nPaid Editions and Premium Services\n\nEven when you consider discounts, H&R Block nearly always comes out cheaper than TurboTax for comparable products.\n\nThere are many reasons you might need to move up to a paid plan with TurboTax or H&R Block. The paid versions are, not surprisingly, easier to use. Besides, the free basic versions don't allow you to take some of the most common deductions or report certain types of income.\n\nH&R Block and TurboTax both allow you to upload tax documents or snap a photo rather than manually entering the data, which can save you quite a bit of time if you have multiple W-2s and 1099s.\n\nHowever, H&R Block's online software wins out on price in every category. Here are the base prices you would pay to file with different types of deductions and income:\n\nIncome type or deduction H&R Block Tax Software TurboTax Student loan interest deduction Free \u2014 $0 Free \u2014 $0 Education credits Free \u2014 $0 Deluxe \u2014 $39 Health savings account Deluxe \u2014 $35 Deluxe \u2014 $39 Itemized deductions Deluxe \u2014 $35 Deluxe \u2014 $39 Rental income Premium \u2014 $65 Premium \u2014 $79 One state tax return $37 $39\n\nNote: Tax prep companies frequently offer discounts on products early in the season. You can check the company websites to see current offers.\n\nAdditional Costs for Add-ons\n\nFor Deluxe packages and higher, H&R Block's pricing includes access to AI Tax Assist, an AI chatbot, to help answer your general tax questions. You can also connect with a live tax professional over the phone for no extra cost. These features give it an edge over TurboTax, which prices expert assistance separately.\n\nIf you want an H&R Block tax pro to look over the return you prepped before submitting it, you'll pay a total of $55 for the Free version, $100 for Deluxe, $160 for Premium, and $180 for Self-Employed. State returns are $37, or $0 with the Free version.\n\nTurboTax's new AI-powered Intuit Assist is available with every online package to answer your questions and help you understand how tax rules apply to your situation. If you want direct and unlimited access to human tax experts, you can upgrade to a Live Assisted package and pay an all-in total between $59 and $179 (plus state fees).\n\nTurboTax also offers to deliver your tax refund up to five days early via direct deposit to your bank account for a fee of $25. If you have a Credit Karma Money account, you can get your refund up to five days early for no fee.\n\nEase of Use and User Experience\n\nInterface and Navigation\n\nBoth providers' online platforms work the same on any computer, and you can even fill out your taxes on your phone with the TurboTax or H&R Block app.\n\nThe DIY TurboTax service walks you through all your possible tax deductions and income sources. For the nervous among us, the journey through the TurboTax universe feels reassuringly guided and knowledgeable. But to some people, TurboTax's guided tax journey can feel like a slog, with many questions that don't relate to your situation. Skipping around is no simple matter \u2014 you might have to hunt for the section you want to fill out next if you feel confident that you know your way around your taxes.\n\nCompared to TurboTax, H&R Block's online interface is stripped down. However, it will collect all the information you need without a lot of fuss and upselling. There are fewer questions and options to choose from up front in H&R Block's online filing portal, but there is always an option to get more information if you need it. The company, which previously relied on foot traffic and appointments at its physical offices, has developed an excellent online tax-filing platform.\n\nFiling Process and Support\n\nAccess to a tax expert is available with every package at H&R Block. But you might just find the online tax prep portal so easy to use that you don't need help from a human. The software will save your place if you need to take a break. You will need to enter your data in a specific order, however. There is less ability to skip things and come back to them than in TurboTax, and again, getting tax help from a human requires an upgrade.\n\nEstimate Your Taxes\n\nCustomer Support Options and Resources\n\nSupport Channels for H&R Block\n\nIn previous years, H&R Block users had to upgrade to a more expensive online plan \u2014 or visit a local office \u2014 to get help from an expert. Now, every plan except the Free version includes access to a generative-AI chatbot and live tax professionals accessible from your account dashboard.\n\nH&R Block lists a general phone number for customer support on its website, as well as support lines for specific products, including online filing and desktop software.\n\nSupport Channels for TurboTax\n\nEvery TurboTax package includes access to an AI tool for general tax questions. If you purchase a Live Assisted package, experts are available between the hours of 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. PT, beginning when the IRS starts accepting tax returns in mid-January until the federal filing deadline on April 15. In the off-seasons, experts are available from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT.\n\nTurboTax lists one general phone number for customer support on its website and a library of help articles.\n\nAudit Support and Assistance\n\nIf you receive an audit letter from the IRS, you have the ability to get one-on-one help from a tax professional at TurboTax at no extra cost. However, the company and its experts cannot provide legal advice or represent you before the IRS.\n\nH&R Block can advise customers on next steps if they receive an audit notice, but charges extra for Worry-Free Audit Support, which can help taxpayers prepare for an audit and provides audit representation.\n\nError-Checking Tools Comparison\n\nTurboTax offers an accuracy guarantee for seven years from the filing date and says it will pay IRS and/or state penalties and interest charges related to underpayment of taxes due to calculation errors. If it's determined that you entered information improperly, the guarantee does not apply.\n\nIndividual filers are also guaranteed to receive their maximum refund with TurboTax. If you later file an amended return with identical information with another tax service and end up with a lower tax bill or higher refund, you can file a claim with TurboTax to have your preparation fees refunded.\n\nH&R Block offers similar assurances. H&R Block's 100% accuracy guarantee ensures that its online products and downloadable software will calculate your taxes accurately. If there's an error that results in penalties or interest from the IRS or a state taxing authority, the company will reimburse your charges up to $10,000.\n\nIf you purchase an online package, you can pay extra for Tax Pro Review, where a professional looks over your return for errors or missed deductions, and makes suggestions where appropriate, before submitting it.\n\nWho Should Use H&R Block vs. TurboTax?\n\nIdeal Software for Simple Returns\n\nH&R Block's Free Edition covers more for simple returns than TurboTax's, since it supports unemployment income and education credits. Both cover W-2 income, limited interest and dividend income, retirement distributions, and both allow claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, the student loan interest deduction, and the standard deduction.\n\nBest Choice for Self-Employed and Small Business Filers\n\nBoth tax software providers offer many benefits for people with self-employment income, including year-round tax planning tools. You won't have to enter your data manually, as 1099s can be uploaded or imported.\n\nIf you're a QuickBooks user, TurboTax is probably going to be the better choice, since the two platforms enjoy full integration. TurboTax's Premium plan covers all self-employment income and deductions for $79, plus state fees. Tax help is going to cost extra.\n\nH&R Block's comparable plan costs $85, plus state fees, and gives you access to a tax pro via chat and phone.\n\nFinal Verdict: Which is Better for Tax Year 2024?\n\nKey Takeaways for Each Tax Software\n\nH&R Block is a good choice if you:\n\nUse CoinTracker for logging cryptocurrency transactions\n\nAnticipate needing help from a tax expert and don't want to pay extra for it\n\nWant the option to pay a tax pro to review your return\n\nTurboTax is a good choice if you:\n\nUse QuickBooks or Credit Karma, which easily integrate with TurboTax\n\nHave a lot of deductions and plan to itemize\n\nMay need professional help and don't mind paying extra for it\n\nFAQs About TurboTax vs. H&R Block\n\nWhich is cheaper, H&R Block or TurboTax?

Zuffa LLC\n\nMerab Dvalishvili, the champ at 135 pounds who cleared the bar with room to spare at 134 on Friday, was 156.8 pounds for his decision victory over Umar Nurmagomedov at Intuit Dome in Inglewood.\n\nIf that sounds like an unfair edge, note that Moicano outweighed Makhachev at 181.8 pounds and Nurmagomedov was identical to Dvalishvili at 156.8.\n\nWeight cutting is an intrinsic element of modern MMA \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 with more extreme cuts increasingly more common at lightweight and below, both for men and women.\n\nEach of the four men in the main and co-main events stepped into the octagon carrying at least 15 percent more mass than he did roughly 36 hours earlier, with Moicano and Dvalishvili eclipsing 17 percent.\n\nOf the 26 competitors on the card, 11 added at least 13 percent more mass, topped out by flyweight Tagir Ulanbekov jumping from 125.5 pounds to 147.4 (17.45 percent larger) for his decision victory over Clayton Carpenter.\n\nUlanbekov\u2019s fight-night weight is the largest by a UFC flyweight who made weight since CSAC began recording such data in 2018.\n\nMerab Dvalishvili punches Umar Nurmagomedov in their UFC bantamweight championship fight. Zuffa LLC\n\nSeven of the 13 bouts at UFC 311, including both championship fights, went off between fighters who were within 4 pounds of one another on fight night \u2014 including four in which each fighter had increased their mass by more than 12 percent between weigh-in and the bout.\n\nReinier de Ridder, a first-round submission winner over Kevin Holland to open the pay-per-view portion of the event, got the victory while possessing a 21.6-pound edge, the largest size gap of the event.\n\nHolland, who has floated between welterweight and middleweight, was originally 183.5 pounds for their 185-pound clash before a relatively small increase to 190, and he was still dwarfed by the 212-pound de Ridder on Saturday.\n\nDe Ridder actually weighed more than Jiri Prochazka, the former lightweight champion who defeated fellow ex-champ Jamahal Hill in their 205-pound showdown.\n\nProchazka, who had toyed with a move down to middleweight, who tipped the scale at 208.2 pounds when he knocked out Hill \u2014 who had swelled to 221.8 by the time he reached the cage.\n\nClearly, the 13.6-pound deficit did not keep Prochazka\u2019s hand from being raised after their thrilling, back-and-forth slugfest.",

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) Expand\n\nINGLEWOOD \u2014 The Clippers\u2019 longtime city rivals were in town and the buzz was unmistakable. The Lakers were making their first visit to the Intuit Dome, the Clippers\u2019 new home, and the arena stands boasted fans from both teams.\n\nClippers fans booed the visitors. Those wearing yellow and purple cheered loudest when the Lakers made a second-half run. But in the end, it was the home team fans who got the final word Sunday night, giving the Clippers a rousing ovation after they posted a 116-102 victory against the Lakers.\n\n\u201cIt felt like home just from the introductions when they were booing the Lakers and the fans were into it too when our guys were introduced to start the game, our fans were into it,\u201d Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. \u201cAnd when they made their run, Laker fans, there weren\u2019t that many in there, but they got kind of loud. But other than that, I thought our fans (gave us) tremendous support.\u201d\n\nThere was much to cheer for on both sides.\n\nFirst, any lingering doubt over Clippers star Kawhi Leonard\u2019s knee, conditioning and ability to stay on the court was erased in less than 25 minutes.\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 oft-injured star looked comfortable in his fifth game this season after missing the first 34, scoring 19 points on 9-of-13 shooting and surpassing the 14,000 career-point mark (14,005) in the process. He also had four assists, and one rebound in matching his season-high for minutes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with the progress,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just about how I\u2019m feeling and I\u2019m coming out. The games feel great, but I still got work to do and we\u2019re going keep taking each step.\u201d\n\nLeonard, who also missed the Clippers\u2019 game against the Denver Nuggets last week to attend to his family during the Pacific Palisades fire, sat out Thursday\u2019s game against Portland as well.\n\nWith another game Monday against the Chicago Bulls and four more this week, Lue capped Leonard\u2019s minutes to 24 minutes, 17 seconds, matching his season high and said Leonard will not play against the Bulls.\n\n\u201cI like Kawhi\u2019s pace, getting to his spot,\u201d Lue said. \u201cHe attacked the basket. So, like I said, we just got to keep building and continue to keep stacking days (for him).\u201d\n\nLue was more concerned about Lakers\u2019 superstar LeBron James and his ability to rally them in any situation.\n\n\u201cSeeing him firsthand and just all the work he puts into his body every single day, the work he puts into his game every single day,\u201d Lue said. \u201cAnd then he\u2019s just a smart player. He gets six, eight, 10 points a game just by doing that because he\u2019s a smart player. But to see what he\u2019s doing now at 40, like you said, I couldn\u2019t imagine that.\u201d\n\nLue said you can\u2019t take anything away from James, who at 40 years old is averaging 23.8 points, 7.5 rebounds and 8.8 assists.\n\n\u201cYou got to try to put it (his greatness) into what you\u2019re trying to do offensively and defensively and just go from there,\u201d Lue said.\n\nExcept the Clippers (24-17) couldn\u2019t ignore James completely. He scored 25 points, five rebounds and 11 assists, many of which fueled a second-half run by the Lakers (22-18).\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 lead swelled to 26 points (90-64) in the third quarter. The Lakers, buoyed by a loud pro-Lakers crowd, ran off nine consecutive points to trim the lead to 90-77 heading into the final quarter.\n\n\u201cAny time tonight there was an empty corner pick-and-roll, they blitzed it,\u201d Lakers point guard Austin Reaves said.\n\nThe Clippers had to scramble to hold off James and Co. after watching their lead dwindle to 96-85 with 8:04 left in the game. Behind a pair of free throws from Ivica Zubac and a 3-pointer from James Harden, the Clippers pushed their lead to 102-85.\n\nReaves connected on two free throws as did James to keep the score close at 104-91, but the Lakers couldn\u2019t overcome the Clippers\u2019 balanced scoring.\n\nNorman Powell led the hosts with 22 points and added four rebounds. He buried a 28-footer with 8:31 left in the second quarter for his 1,000th career 3-pointer.\n\nHarden contributed 21 points, 12 assists and four rebounds. He passed Oscar Robertson for 14th place on the NBA\u2019s career scoring list and now has 26,721.\n\nZubac had another double-double with 21 points and 19 rebounds (eight offensive), again missing the 20-20 mark.\n\nThe game played out just as Lakers coach JJ Redick had feared. The Lakers had 17 turnovers and a handful of errant passes that landed in their opponents\u2019 hands. They are averaging 12.7 turnovers.\n\n\u201cThey capitalized off our turnovers and mistakes defensively,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great team. Very well-coached. Hall of Famers, great complementary players, Norm Powell having a great season, Big Zu, big time. \u2026 You know, when you\u2019re playing against a great team, you gotta limit your mistakes, offensively and defensively. Cause they make you pay, and I think they did that tonight.\u201d\n\nIn the second quarter, Reaves lost the ball, then Powell stole another pass and Derrick Jones Jr. turned it into an alley-oop dunk off a pass from Amir Coffey for a 64-49 halftime lead.\n\n\u201cThey have a lot of guys with really good hands,\u201d Redick said. \u201cThey got eight guys, averaging 0.9 steals or more. It\u2019s obviously on tape as well.\u201d\n\nRedick said the Clippers\u2019 defensive skills only paled to their offensive talent. The Clippers, led by Powell\u2019s 23.7 ppg, are averaging 109.6 points. They have beaten their past three opponents by an average of 33.\n\n\u201cGot to take care of the basketball today,\u201d Redick said. \u201cGot to be organized and then they got some really good offensive players. James (Harden), Kawhi, Norman Powell and (Ivica) Zubac are probably playing the best basketball of his career, so they\u2019re a great team.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers got rolling early and led by six at the end of the first quarter. They continued their hot shooting, outscoring the Lakers 32-23 in the second to open their 15-point halftime lead.\n\nRui Hachimura added 19 points for the Lakers. Anthony Davis had 16 points and 10 rebounds in his return after missing a game with plantar fasciitis.",

But this night was different. James was visiting the Intuit Dome, the new home of the LA Clippers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames didn\u2019t think it would be different for his first visit to Inglewood. After all, he\u2019s played games in Seattle and New Jersey before teams moved to different homes.\n\n\u201cIt will be just like going to any new arena,\u201d James said Friday night. \u201cThe same as when Golden State moved from Oracle. It will be the same when anybody else had a new arena.\u201d\n\nThe Basketball 100 The story of the greatest players in NBA history. In 100 riveting profiles, top basketball writers justify their selections and uncover the history of the NBA in the process. The story of the greatest plays in NBA history. Buy\n\nJames had made two free throws earlier in the game. So did teammate Anthony Davis, who made free throws despite giant cardboard cutouts of fans shaving his signature unibrow.\n\nBut this instance saw James miss almost everything on his attempt.\n\nIt was one of only two missed free throws for the Lakers, but it came at a moment when the Clippers held the Lakers without a field goal during the last 6:02 of the second quarter and took a double-digit lead that they would not relinquish for the rest of the game. The Clippers cruised to a 116-102 victory Sunday in the first regular-season meeting between the two Los Angeles teams outside of a shared arena in 25 years.\n\nThe two most recent Clippers games at Intuit Dome have had muted attendance because of the wildfires disaster, as well as the Lakers having home games the same night as the Clippers this week. Home attendance for the Clippers this season has only averaged 16,205, a league-low, despite the impressive new venue. But Sunday\u2019s crowd was a sellout of 17,927, and the lively arena was certainly something new to Lakers players, if not necessarily James himself.\n\n\u201cI thought the fans were great,\u201d Lakers guard Austin Reaves said. \u201cI thought, obviously I don\u2019t get to walk around and see everything else other than the court, watching the big jumbo, you know, big whatever the 360 screen in the middle. But I think it\u2019s a very nice arena.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntuit Dome was built to be as hostile to visiting NBA teams as possible. The primary feature: The Wall, a stack of 51 rows uninterrupted by suites (or multi-platform media companies founded by James and Maverick Carter) situated at the baseline of the visiting team\u2019s bench. The objective of The Wall is that it is populated only by certified Clippers fans.\n\n\u201cThe Wall changed the game,\u201d says Darian Vaziri, 26, a content creator and youth sports coach from Los Angeles who was in attendance on The Wall Sunday night. \u201cIt just gives us an opportunity to start chants and set the tone for our arena. Laker fans were being either kicked out or asked to remove their Laker jerseys or jackets in The Wall. It was heavier security than ever tonight. It almost felt like tonight was what the Wall was created for.\n\n\u201cAnd also, the Lakers did have at least 40 percent of the crowd if I had to guess, but you couldn\u2019t really hear them too much due to the way the game went.\u201d\n\nGO DEEPER Fly on The Wall! Opening night and opposing fans in LA Clippers' Intuit Dome eyepopping section\n\nThe cacophony of Lakers fans competing with Clippers fans peaked when the Lakers cut a 26-point third quarter Clippers lead down to 15 to end the period, and down to 11 with 4 1/2 minutes left to play. But the Clippers were never threatened, and by the end of the game, Lakers starter Max Christie was being guarded by his brother, rookie Cam Christie of the Clippers, while James\u2019 son Bronny played the rest of the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Reaves said of The Wall. \u201cIt kind of gives you more of like a college atmosphere to where \u2026 I don\u2019t even really want to elaborate on it. So yeah\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the fan and arena noise affected him, Reaves didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have an answer for that,\u201d Reaves said.\n\nThe arena was so expansive that multiple Lakers players got lost on their way out when trying to find the players\u2019 parking lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not the territory that the Lakers are used to. For 25 years, the Clippers and the Lakers shared the building that opened as STAPLES Center in downtown Los Angeles in 1999. The Lakers had the coziest road games in the league; even when they \u201cvisited\u201d the Clippers, it felt like a Lakers arena dressed up in Clippers colors.\n\nThe best attempt to address that was when Doc Rivers was hired as head coach and senior vice president of the Clippers in 2013. Rivers brought current Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue with him as an assistant, and he traded for current Lakers head coach JJ Redick to be his starting shooting guard. Rivers also decided to cover the Lakers\u2019 championship banners and retired numbers with massive portraits of current Clippers players for all Clippers home games, an arrangement that stayed in place for the remainder of the Clippers\u2019 time hosting games in downtown LA.\n\n\u201cListen, I think this is our arena when we play,\u201d Rivers said in 2013. \u201cNo disrespect to them. But when we play, it\u2019s the Clippers\u2019 arena as far as I know.\u201d\n\nSo instead of looking up at player portraits, opponents are staring at The Wall.\n\nRedick, who played for the Clippers from 2013 through 2017 at the peak of Lob City, said he got to Intuit Dome at 2 p.m., earlier than his typical pregame arrival time, to marvel at the arena. He credited Clippers chairman Steve Ballmer as \u201ctruly being one of the best owners in sports.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat atmosphere,\u201d Redick said afterward. \u201cJust a great setup. \u2026 Truly a fun place to play in. And obviously being Lakers-Clippers, it was a great atmosphere. You felt the juice. You felt the energy. It was fun.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough season for visiting Intuit Dome shooters, as they have made only 73.3 percent of free throws, second-worst of any arena in the league (visitors to the Rockets\u2019 Toyota Center have made only 71.4 percent from the line). Three teams \u2014 the Raptors, Warriors and Nuggets \u2014 have lost games at Intuit Dome while missing more free throws than the final margin of defeat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFree throws were the least of the Lakers\u2019 problems overall Sunday. Lue, who won two championships with the franchise, has coached 16 games against the Lakers as the Clippers head coach. His Clippers team has led at the end of the first quarter all 16 times, and is now 13-3 against the Lakers. A game like Sunday was another reminder of the full circle Lue has enjoyed in his NBA career as a player and coach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s where it all started for me,\u201d Lue said of Inglewood, where the Clippers currently play and where the Lakers played when Lue was a rookie in the 1998-99 NBA season, the final one for the Lakers at the Forum. \u201cComing to L.A., 20, 21 years old, just fall in love with the city, everything it stood for. Coming back to Inglewood now playing, it\u2019s just like damn, right down the street is where it all started for me. And I\u2019ve come back full circle, 27 years later. I\u2019m back again. So it feels good.\u201d\n\nThe presence of the Lakers is why Intuit Dome even exists. The Lakers moved from Minneapolis, where they won five pre-shot clock championships, in 1960. They played at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, located about five miles south of downtown Los Angeles, until their first game at the Forum on Dec. 31, 1967. The Clippers franchise originated as the Buffalo Braves in upstate New York in 1970 before relocating to Southern California as the San Diego Clippers in 1978. The only championship the Lakers won in Los Angeles before the Clippers\u2019 arrival to San Diego was in 1972.\n\nThe Lakers went on to win two championships (1980, 1982) while the Clippers were in San Diego. The rivalry got closer in 1984, when the Clippers left San Diego for Los Angeles and played at the Lakers\u2019 old home at the Sports Arena. The Lakers won a championship immediately in 1985, the Clippers\u2019 first season in Los Angeles, and went back-to-back in 1987 and 1988 while the Clippers were in the midst of what was a franchise-defining 15-year postseason drought.\n\nThe Clippers played several games in the 1990s in Anaheim, hosting the Lakers three times (a win in 1997, and losses in 1998 and 1999). But rather than relocate to Orange County, the Clippers agreed to join the Lakers and the Los Angeles Kings at STAPLES Center in time for the 1999-2000 season. The arrangement made the Clippers a third tenant (after the Lakers and the NHL\u2019s Los Angeles Kings), with the Lakers getting preferential dates and game times compared to the Clippers on an annual basis. The Lakers went on to win a championship in the first year at STAPLES Center, and six titles total while sharing an arena with the Clippers.\n\n\u201cIt is, in a way, a historic meeting,\u201d longtime retired Clippers broadcaster Ralph Lawler texted to The Athletic. \u201cThe Lakers have always had all the key cards in the deck. First it was LA over San Diego, and then the Forum over the L.A. Sports Arena, then the feeling they were \u2018letting\u2019 the Clippers be a third-ranking tenant in \u2018their\u2019 Staples Center home for 25 years.\u201d\n\nBut now, the Clippers have broken from the history of sharing an arena with the Lakers or occupying their former buildings, even if Intuit Dome is in an old Lakers neighborhood. Intuit Dome is a place that has energized Clippers players, such as Kawhi Leonard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have our own arena, our own \u2013 even a locker room there, being either the third or fourth important team in the building,\u201d said Leonard in September of the change from downtown Los Angeles to Intuit Dome. \u201cWith scheduling and everything, it helps. You know, just get comfortable and just feel like a home base for you rather than you being a roommate.\u201d\n\nThere will be plenty more Lakers-Clippers games. The two teams play three more times this season, including one more time at Intuit Dome. To the players and coaches, it won\u2019t be as big a deal to the fans.\n\n\u201cSame, I mean, this game is like any other game for me,\u201d Leonard said after this edition of Lakers-Clippers Sunday night. \u201cWhoever it is on the other side of the court.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s perhaps easier to say afterward. They certainly felt a different game in this new chapter of this civic rivalry.\n\n\u201cIt was great, it felt like home,\u201d Lue said after the game. \u201cFor introductions, when they were booing the Lakers. Fans were into it when our guys were introduced. And to start the game, our fans were into it. Not until they made their run, Lakers fans \u2013 they weren\u2019t that many in there \u2013 but they got kind of loud. But other than that, I thought our fans were tremendous. Support was there. And like I said, just feels good to have a place to call home and yours.\u201d\n\nSign up to get The Bounce, the essential NBA newsletter from Zach Harper and The Athletic staff, delivered free to your inbox.\n\n(Photo of LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard: Jevone Moore / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)",

            "content": "It is tax time again in the United States which means we are set to be inundated with countless ads to file our taxes. Companies like Intuit (responsible for Turbo Tax), Taxslayer, H&R block, Tax Act and many more that I probably don\u2019t care to know about are bombarding all of us with ads exhorting us to use their systems to get the money we are owed back from the federal government. They use fancy graphics, silly mascots, and a plethora of marketing gimmicks to get people excited about tax time.\n\nFor only a fee, you can have access to your own money how ZANY is that!?\n\nAnd it is all, in my opinion, a dire fucking scam. And I\u2019m not just talking about the tax filling programs, but we\u2019ll start with these companies first.\n\nThere are many things that are bought and sold and marketed to Americans, but up near the top of the list must be the interjection of a private middleman between the citizen and their public funds. These tax preparation companies are little more than a private \u201ctoll\u201d that most citizens must pay to get access to funds they technically already own and are entitled to. These tolls add up, too. These software and tax preparation companies rake in BILLIONS of dollars every year. Here are a few ways that they are scamming the United States of America -often with the explicit and implicit permission of conservative law makers!\n\n\u00b7 They add little to no value for most of their consumers. Most tax filers use the standard deduction and do not need itemized deductions or complicated calculations to file their taxes.\n\n\u00b7 These companies intentionally obfuscate alternatives and have been found to drive consumers away from free or reduced-price programs in favor of their for-profit tax filing schemes. Turbotax was found to have intentionally done exactly this, yet they are still around!\n\n\u00b7 Most of these companies take their tax preparation fees and roll them around into anti-consumer practices like those listed above. These companies consistently lobby against efforts to make tax filing transparent, free, or even proactive from the government with pre-filed forms.\n\n\u00b7 Private data breaches and misallocation of funds is not only a risk, but an occurrence that has happened with returns being mis-routed and private data being compromised. An additional risk that need not be taken on by the consumer, especially when it comes to balancing their tax books with the government.\n\n\u00b7 They don\u2019t need to exist. There is one entity that knows all our tax payments and income (for non-self-employed folks) via accounting work done by employers \u2013 the state and federal government themselves!\n\nLike so many other things, the US system finds itself to be unique and worse in almost every way surrounding this issue. In other countries this is not the case, they do not attempt to privatize everything without adding any sort of value. In Japan for example, the government has a log of taxes paid and your income, then work form there with a return being automatically set to go to the taxpayer. Rather than having the citizen research all of this, the government calculates the numbers and lets the citizen verify THEIR work instead of the other way around. In New Zealand, the process is similar: the forms are pre-filled and sent to the citizen, they have a chance to go over them and give the authorization to continue with either a stroke of the pen or the click of a mouse. It really is that easy. We know this because the US and state governments do this all the time, they just don\u2019t act on it unless they are owed money.\n\nA random Dutch return. Two pages, simple and easy.\n\nSo why isn\u2019t that the case in the United States? Why can\u2019t the government here do the same thing? Shoot, we saw the government create and launch a website for health insurance that was functional and still works today, why can this not be the case with tax filing? The US government operates one of the most efficient mail delivery systems in the world, but can\u2019t handle tax filing without private interests? Of course not.\n\nThe answer is, as with most things that are worse in the US are caused by the capture of the government by private interests and an almost religious opposition to progress and public works by conservatives.\n\nThese ideas have been floated before with free filing programs being introduced in the last few decades. But what happened? The companies flouted them or misled the public about them or stopped participating all together. Not because they were unpopular or unwieldy, but because they made less profits for the private owners. Instead, they spend millions of dollars to ensure their place between the citizenry and their money and legislators and judges in prominent positions are all too happy to take those dollars. Seriously, who is really harmed by making taxes easier? Certainly not the taxpayer and certainly not the government. The only losers in a better and more efficient tax filing system are the private middlemen who rely on its existence.\n\nI say fuck \u2018em.\n\nThe IRS could do all of this for us, from the top rope or in the office and for far cheaper.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the US government as well as state governments already have nearly all the information, they would need to file returns and ensure taxes are filed correctly without the need for costly and arcane middlemen. For the vast majority of taxpayers this could be as simple as getting a notice in the mail indicating the discrepancy, signing off on it, or providing information on additional sources of income that may have been missing. This could be done quickly, easily, and far more cheaply than purchasing some tired piece of software and paying some middleman for the privilege. For those that DO need more complicated accounting work done like businesses, self employed folks, or those that have higher incomes, by all means! CPA\u2019s abound across our country, they are already addressing the needs of those clients already.\n\nThese companies and processes are indicative of the harm that private interests will wreak on the public if given the opportunity to do so. Turbotax, Taxslayer, H & R Block, and companies like them are cancers on the fiscal health of the United States and the sooner we do away with the scam of income tax filing every year, the better off we will all be. We should excise this cancer all together.\n\nAnnual settling of the tax books should be easy, transparent, and something done proactively by our government. Not just because it benefits the consumer, but because it is simply more efficient at what it is supposed to do. Think of how much money could be saved if instead of spinning off a profit to a middleman, the money went right back into the accounts of who is entitled to it via public accounting measures? Think of how fewer errors in filing there would be if the IRS simply worked it up on their end and presented the results to the taxpayer? Think of how much less stress there would be for working people if this was something done by public professionals instead of forcing them to track down multiple tax documents to file?",

            "content": "INGLEWOOD \u2014 The overachieving, underappreciated Clippers cooked the Lakers so thoroughly in a 116-102 victory on Sunday night it was as if JJ Redick had ordered it that way when he shared his thoughts on the Intuit Dome before the Lakers\u2019 first game there: \u201cWell done,\u201d he had said, \u201cwell done.\u201d\n\nThe chefs hosting the game were only too happy to oblige. They built a lead as large as 26 points, made the Lakers \u2013 struggling to tread water at 22-18 \u2013 look stagnant and vulnerable, and triggered LeBron James\u2019 annual midseason denouncement of his team\u2019s roster construction.\n\nAnd it brought to mind a familiar riddle: What would it take?\n\nWhat would it take for the Clippers to really work their way into the hearts and minds of Lakers-loving Los Angeles? To turn their slice of the pie into a bigger chunk, to make a true and lasting dent?\n\nNever say never, they say.\n\nAnything is possible, they say.\n\nDefense wins championships, they tell us (for what it\u2019s worth, these bought-in Clippers have the second-best defensive rating in the NBA).\n\nIf you build it they will come? That one might turn out to be a Hollywood myth.\n\nThe Clippers have built this remarkable new arena, right? The place is so \u201cdope, super-dope,\u201d that even Lakers fans like Daniel Balver, visiting for the first time Sunday, had to give props.\n\nIt\u2019s a high-tech hoops palace with so many original flourishes that resonate with basketball connoisseurs. There\u2019s the d\u00e9cor: high school jerseys from all over the state lining the wide concourse. \u201cMy favorite part,\u201d Laker fan Anup Parikh said.\n\nAnd the outdoor court, steps away from the arena\u2019s entrance, inviting to anyone with a jump shot: \u201cI love, love the basketball court for the people,\u201d Sumer Sharma said. \u201cAnd I love how people react to it. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s somebody there regulating the system, there\u2019s some balls on the court and it\u2019s just do whatever you want to do. That\u2019s beautiful; that\u2019s L.A. Just people amongst people. Different jerseys, all playing together.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers, of course, would prefer for all of those Angelenos be wearing their jerseys. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve cordoned off The Wall for only card-carrying Clippers fans, the marquee feature inside the arena, that steep, almost continuous 51-row section behind the basket near the visiting team\u2019s bench.\n\nYou can see the vision, and the results: Before the Lakers\u2019 visit, opponents were making just 72.8% (152 of 209) of their free throws against The Wall.\n\nBut I have yet to see that 4,500-seat section bottom-to-top full, including Sunday in what was an announced sellout. All 17,927 tickets might have been sold, but not all of those seats had a fan\u2019s fanny in it.\n\nThis riddle-wrapped conundrum, L.A.\u2019s other basketball team: The Clippers haven\u2019t had a losing season in 13 years, so it really shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that they\u2019re good again. They entered Monday with a 24-17 record. Or that they\u2019re a top-five seed in a deep Western Conference. That Coach Tyronn Lue has a group that started the season short on star power playing hard and playing together and still scratching the surface. Because they\u2019ve just started integrating their best player \u2013 oft-injured two-time NBA champion Kawhi Leonard \u2013 into their game plans. And they\u2019ve got the super-dope new arena.\n\nThey should be a hot ticket, and they would be in most markets: Good basketball, fun venue, a great time.\n\nBut the Clippers are the worst-drawing team in the NBA, averaging 16,205 fans per game \u2013 fewer than any in any non-COVID season since 2009, when the they finished the season 19-63.\n\nIs it the $70 cost to park in the arena\u2019s dedicated structure? The traffic between downtown L.A., where they previously played, and their $2 billion new operational hub in Inglewood? Maybe the restrictions on who can sit amongst the supporters on The Wall?\n\nOr is it local history and tradition? Love and loyalty, won over decades in L.A; the Lakers\u2019 17 NBA championships to the Clippers\u2019 none? \u201cShowtime,\u201d Shaq and Kobe, LeBron \u2026\n\nIf you\u2019re from L.A., you know the deal, like you might know that, with Sunday\u2019s result, the Lakers have lost to the Clippers 31 times in 40 games since Steve Ballmer rescued the organization from former owner Donald Sterling.\n\nUnder Ballmer, the Clippers have been consistent, competent, creative, competitive. They refurbished every public court in L.A. and branded it with their logo. They have managed assets smartly. But they\u2019ve been unlucky and underwhelming; the \u201c213 Era\u201d that brought both Leonard and Paul George to L.A. \u2013 two local guys who spurned the Lakers \u2013 ended with just one Western Conference finals appearance in five seasons.\n\nWhat would it have meant if the Clippers had won one Larry O\u2019Brien championship trophy with one of the George-and-Leonard teams? Lou Williams said when that \u201c213 Era\u201d was tipping off: \u201cWe can possibly hear boos at our own parade.\u201d\n\nOK, what if they had won two? How many of those so-far-impossibly-hard-to-come-by titles would it take? And who\u2019s winning them? Because the Clippers would also have to win in style, with a star or stars who aren\u2019t only killers in the clutch but who have the charisma to command the spotlight in the crowded constellation that is L.A.\n\nNever say never?\n\nMaybe the Clippers will forever play the pesky younger sibling. Maybe they\u2019re more of a proverbial thorn in the side. But eventually their bad luck is going to run out and their competence and competitiveness will be rewarded. And then they\u2019ve got the super-dope arena. So maybe they will come.\n\nWhat would it take for the Clippers make up real ground in L.A.?\n\nThat doesn\u2019t usually feel like a serious question. But watching Sunday as the Clippers dismantled the Lakers again, and did it under their own roof, flag firmly planted, it didn\u2019t seem ludicrous to wonder.",

Hall of Famers, great complementary players, Norm Powell having a great season, Big Zu, big time...\n\n\u201cYou know, when you\u2019re playing against a great team, you gotta limit your mistakes, offensively and defensively. \u2018Cause they make you pay, and I think they did that tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers, people around the league almost unanimously expect, will likely be quiet at the trade deadline (despite having a number of players coveted by NBA teams). Their big move is more straightforward \u2014 reintegrating Kawhi Leonard as they try to keep him available for the rest of the season.\n\nLeonard played 24 minutes and 17 seconds \u2014 a season high \u2014 as he continues to work back from the knee issues that have bothered him much of his time with the Clippers. He scored 19 points on only 13 shots, dishing out three of his four assists early in the first quarter to help the Clippers set the tone.\n\n\u201cWe knew coming into the season that we can be great defensively and that\u2019s going to give us a chance every night. That\u2019s what we have been doing all year along,\u201d Zubac said. \u201cKawhi is getting back. He\u2019s being aggressive. He\u2019s looking good and when the minutes restrictions goes away, we\u2019re going to be a tough team to beat.\u201d\n\nPowell finished with 22 points and James Harden had 21 points and 12 assists for the Clippers (24-17).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe schedule will probably lessen the luster from the Clippers, who have won their last three games by an average of 34 points. They play five times this week, their schedule moved around as a result of wildfire postponements.\n\nThe Lakers have two more chances at home before beginning their annual Grammy road trip, hosting Washington on Tuesday before another rivalry game Thursday against the Celtics.\n\n\u201cI think we are growing and we all know that during the growth process you have some bumps and that\u2019s OK,\u201d Redick said. \u201cThat\u2019s OK. ... We\u2019re together and we\u2019re connected certainly more times than not. And we\u2019ll continue to grow and build. But there was some good stuff tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers aren\u2019t where they want to be, at least not when it comes to any form of a consistent identity. Playing against a team that knows its identity like the Clippers, the differences become obvious.",

            "content": "Just days before UFC 199 was to be the premier MMA promotion\u2019s first fight card in Inglewood, UFC President Dana White raved about the recently remodeled Forum and called it the nicest arena he\u2019d ever toured.\n\nNearly nine years later, after Inglewood\u2019s newest jewel, Intuit Dome, had hosted its first combat sports event, White was exuberant in his praise of the five-month-old facility that hosted UFC 311 on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cThis is incredible. I\u2019ve been saying this since we did the Sphere,\u201d White said, alluding to the unique Las Vegas spectacle that was the site of UFC 306 in September. \u201cThis is where arenas are headed. More sports and entertainment. You know, the big LED screens, the seats light up, the steam, the smoke. That\u2019s where this whole thing\u2019s headed.\u201d\n\nAs for the event itself Saturday, which was sold out with 18,370 in attendance, White was equally as ebullient in an exclusive interview with the Southern California News Group.\n\nOne day after the main event was shaken by the withdrawal of bantamweight title challenger Arman Tsarukyan due to injury, UFC 311 lost no traction in becoming the highest-grossing event in Intuit Dome\u2019s young history and the most lucrative event the UFC has held in California.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have gone better. $10.2 million gate budget. Was $7.5 when the fight fell out, we\u2019re at $9.5 and we ended up going to $10.2 with a different main event. So, yeah, it could not have gone better,\u201d White said after Saturday blew past the $7.26 million gate accrued by UFC 298 at Honda Center in March.\n\n\u201cFights were awesome. So you can always have the bells and whistles and all the good (stuff), all the fights delivered. Tonight was really good.\u201d\n\nLess than two weeks before UFC 311, devastating fires broke out and tore through the Palisades and Altadena communities. While there was some buzz about the event being moved out of Southern California, White said that was \u201cnever\u201d a consideration.\n\n\u201cNo way, no way. This place would have had to catch fire\u201d White said of Intuit Dome. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do it. And lots of people were coming up to me, saying to me tonight, that are from L.A., \u2018Thank you so much for bringing this here. We needed this and this is a big deal.\u2019 It was very important.\u201d\n\nMAKHACHEV MOVES UP\n\nWith Tsarukyan out, lightweight champion Islam Makhachev was given a new opponent in Renato Moicano, who was elevated from main card to main event on one day\u2019s notice. Makhachev needed just 4 minutes and 5 seconds to secure a D\u2019arce choke and force Moicano to tap out.\n\nWith his 15th consecutive UFC victory, which is tied for second all time, and unprecedented fourth lightweight title defense, the Dagestani 155-pounder earned high praise from White, who had long viewed heavyweight champion and former light heavyweight icon Jon Jones as the best pound-for-pound fighter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it. He\u2019s the pound-for-pound best in the world right now and he\u2019s definitely the best to ever to do it in that division,\u201d White said.\n\nBONUSES\n\nIn the co-main event, Merab Dvalishvili and Umar Nurmagomedov won Fight of the Night bonuses after putting on what could go down as the best bantamweight championship fight in UFC history.\n\nNicknamed \u201cThe Machine\u201d for good reason, an indefatigable Dvalishvili kept up the pace in the third round and showed no signs of slowing in the two ensuing championship rounds in retaining his title via unanimous decision (48-47, 48-47, 49-46).\n\nNurmagomedov, who said postfight that he believed he broke his hand in the opening round, came into the bout with an 18-0 record and never having lost a single round or been taken down in six UFC fights.\n\nAn undeterred Dvalishvili completed seven of 30 takedown attempts, and in doing so broke welterweight legend Georges St-Pierre\u2019s UFC all-time record of 91 takedowns.\n\nPerformance of the Night bonuses went to Ji\u0159\u00ed Proch\u00e1zka, for his third-round TKO of fellow former light heavyweight champion Jamahl Hill, and Jailton Almeida for his first-round TKO of fellow top-10 heavyweight Serghei Spivac.\n\nPITBULL AND PICO\n\nEyebrows arched when White, at his postfight press conference, was asked about former PFL fighters Patricio Pitbull and Aaron Pico.\n\nPitbull, a former two-division champion in Bellator, and Pico, the Whittier native and world-class wrestler who signed with Bellator when he was 17 and now trains in Albuquerque, New Mexico, could be significant additions for the UFC.\n\nPitbull, 37, recently received his unconditional release from PFL, which acquired Bellator and its roster last year and recently terminated it while absorbing its fighters.\n\nPFL\u2019s exclusive negotiating window with the 28-year-old Pico, winner of nine of his past 10 fights and viewed as one of the most enticing featherweights in the sport, ends soon.\n\nOf Pitbull, White said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. \u2026 I\u2019ll talk to the boys about that, and we\u2019ll see where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Pico, White indicated his matchmakers were much more keen on that prospect: \u201cI definitely know the boys are interested in him. Yeah.\u201d",

Clippers had been played at Crypto.com Arena until Sunday night when the two teams squared off at the brand new Intuit Dome in Inglewood for the first time.\n\nThe Lakers were looking for their third straight while the Clippers were looking for their fourth. Something had to give and ultimately it was the Clippers who came out on top with an easy 116-102 victory to drop the Lakers to 22-18 on the season.\n\nNorman Powell got the Clippers off to a good start with seven quick points although LeBron James responded with back-to-back triples. James Harden then had a four-point play though and Kawhi Leonard got in on the action from deep, forcing a timeout by JJ Redick with his team down 18-12.\n\nAnthony Davis began to make his presence felt offensively from there but Harden and the Clippers stayed hot to take a 32-26 lead at the end of the first.\n\nPowell stayed hot to begin the second quarter while Kevin Porter Jr. heated up as well, extending the Clippers\u2019 lead to double digits for the first time.\n\nThe Lakers were struggling offensively with some careless turnovers and were in dire need of a spark to end the half. They were able to get anything going though as the Clippers continued pouring it on to take a 64-49 lead into the locker room.\n\nNot much changed for the Lakers to start the third quarter as they continued to commit costly turnovers. Meanwhile, Ivica Zubac continued to dominate the offensive glass and all of a sudden the deficit ballooned to 26.\n\nTo end the third quarter, the Lakers finally mounted an 11-0 run with Davis and Dalton Knecht leading the way offensively. After James beat the buzzer with a layup, the Lakers cut their deficit to 92-77 going into the fourth quarter.\n\nJames continued the Lakers run into the fourth as they quickly got the deficit to 11 with a chance to make a run at it. Unfortunately, Zubac continued to punish the Lakers down low. Austin Reaves then had a costly turnover and Harden turned it into a triple to put his team back up by 17.\n\nWith the Lakers unable to stop the trio of Zubac, Harden and Powell, the Clippers would go on to close the game out easily at Intuit Dome.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the Lakers\n\nThe Lakers will now return to the other side of town to host the Washington Wizards on Tuesday and then the Boston Celtics on Thursday.\n\nHave you subscribed to our YouTube channel?

Austin Reaves had 14 points on 4-6 shooting, but had five turnovers to three assists.\n\nAnthony Davis had 16 points and 10 rebounds but struggled against Ivica Zubac, who dominated the interior on the night and finished with 21 points and 19 rebounds. Rui Hachimura had 19 points after coming alive in the second half while Max Christie had 10.\n\nNorman Powell scored the opening seven points for the Clippers, but Rui, AD and Austin all had baskets in response. The two teams traded baskets throughout the opening minutes, including a pair of 3-pointers from LeBron and four-point play from James Harden.\n\nLEBRON & HARDEN TRADE TRIPLES\n\n\n\nLakers/Clippers on NBA TV pic.twitter.com/OwJOVYxAlo \u2014 NBA (@NBA) January 20, 2025\n\nEventually, a Kawhi Leonard long-range make moved the hosts ahead 18-12 and forced an early timeout. Christie eventually helped the Lakers get back within a possession with a wing three, but again the Clippers responded to keep the Lakers at a distance.\n\nA fresh look at the two-big lineups saw AD and Jaxson Hayes share the floor near the end of the first. A new rotation saw LeBron close the first while AD went to the bench late in the period.\n\nUltimately, the Lakers didn\u2019t make much headway in the deficit no matter the lineup as they went into the second period trailing 32-26.\n\nThe Clippers used another spurt to start the second quarter to open up a 37-28 advantage. Reaves knocked down an important 3-pointer to keep the Lakers attached and Gabe Vincent got to the rim to make it a 37-33 game.\n\nSome timely jumpers from the Clippers kept them ahead by multiple possessions, but LeBron and Reaves continued their strong showings from Friday against the Nets to pull the Lakers back into the contest. After a Max layup made it a 43-41 game, the Clippers responded with back-to-back baskets to make it a six-point game again.\n\nA trio of scores from Ivica Zubac (curse you Magic) and Kawhi Leonard were part of a 13-3 run that pushed the Clippers up 56-44. A host of good looks from range for the Lakers would not fall and, suddenly, the Lakers trailed 62-45 late in the period.\n\nAt the half, the Lakers trailed by 15.\n\nThe unseriousness continued into the second half as the lead grew to 20 points fairly quickly with the Clippers holding a 38-18 edge in paint points. A Derrick Jones Jr. 3-pointer made it a 75-54 lead and forced another timeout.\n\nKawhi started to find a groove, punishing a Lakers zone with mid-range jumpers. A Harden 3-pointer after a Zubac offensive rebound pushed the lead to 24 points.\n\nThe Clippers only continued to pile it on. Midway through the third, the Lakers had zero second-chance points to the Clippers\u2019 11 and were losing the battle in the paint 44-24.\n\nJust as it felt like the Lakers were fully letting go of the rope, suddenly they pieced together an 11-0 run that featured their first second-chance points of the night on a Dalton Knecht 3-pointer, making it a 90-75 game.\n\nLeBron closed the quarter with an impressive running floater over multiple defenders. Hilariously, the Lakers went into the final frame in the exact same spot they were in starting the second half, trailing by 15 points.\n\nLeBron found Rui and Jaxson Hayes for alley-oops to make it a 13-point deficit. For as impressive as he was on the night, blown opportunities at the rim from LeBron kept the Lakers from inching even closer. Rui forced a timeout with a mid-range jumper that made it a 96-85 game.\n\nZubac\u2019s three-point play in response helped stem the tide. AD had a pair of mid-range jumpers not fall and Harden turned a Reaves turnover into a 3-pointer to effectively end the Lakers\u2019 fake comeback and make it a 17-point game again.\n\nThe Lakers did cut it back to an 11-point game again, but it never felt like much of a threat. Adding insult to injury late, Reaves limped to the bench after going after a loose ball.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nTy Lue absolutely owns the Lakers. These games play out so similar every time. The Clippers look more prepared, drill a bunch of 3-pointers and control the game. Considering how badly the Lakers mishandled the Lue situation years ago, this feels like neverending karmic justice.\n\nThe Lakers have some figuring out to do. Too often when they play serious teams, they look a mess. On nights like this, the roster still doesn\u2019t feel close.\n\nI really hope the Crypto Curse has not claimed DFS.\n\nLeBron needs to go back to the headband if he\u2019s going to smoke layups like he did on Sunday.\n\nYou can follow Jacob on Twitter at @JacobRude.",

            "content": "Organizers announced the first names in a star-studded lineup of a benefit show for wildfire relief, though the biggest surprise is that the previously announced FireAid is now two concerts taking place simultaneously at Intuit Dome and the Kia Forum on Thursday, Jan. 30.\n\nThe lineup announced Thursday includes originally included a solo Gwen Stefani, but on Saturday, Jan. 18, that was changed to a reunion of No Doubt, in which Stefani started her career. Other performers include Billie Eilish and Finneas, Green Day, Joni Mitchell, Jelly Roll, and Sting. Also appearing are Earth, Wind & Fire, Pink, Rod Stewart, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Dave Mathews and John Mayer performing together for the first time.\n\nAdditional performers include Stevie Nicks, Stephen Stills, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Gracie Abrams, Lil Baby, and Tate McRae.\n\nMost of the artists on the bill have ties to Southern California, where the Palisades and Eaton fires have caused the deaths of at least 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in Pacific Palisades.\n\nStills and Mitchell hark back to the \u201960s and the Laurel Canyon singer-songwriter scene, with Nicks part of the \u201970s crowd. Red Hot Chili Peppers and Stefani represent the late \u201980s and \u201990s alternative rock crowd.\n\nBillie Eilish, her brother Finneas O\u2019Connell, and Abrams are younger artists from the L.A. region. Others, like Sting, Stewart and Lady Gaga, are from the East Coast or England but have long had homes here.\n\nMore artists and special guests, and information on specific lineups for Intuit Dome and the Kia Forum, which are just blocks apart in Inglewood, will be announced soon, organizers said in a news release.\n\nTickets will go on sale at noon Pacific on Wednesday, Jan. 22 through Ticketmaster.\n\nFireAid will also be broadcast at some AMC Theatres in 70 different markets. It will also be live-streamed through a plethora of platforms that normally are competitors, including Apple Music and the Apple TV app, Max, iHeartRadio, KTLA+, Netflix/Tudom, Paramount+, Prime Video and the Amazon Music Channel on Twitch, SiriusXM, Spotify, SoundCloud. Veeps, and YouTube.\n\nFans anywhere can donate to the wildfire relief efforts during the live streams on the platforms listed above.\n\nFunds raised by FireAid will be distributed in consultation with the Annenberg Foundation and will target both short-term relief efforts and long-term projects to prevent future fire disasters. All proceeds from the concerts will go to relief efforts thanks to the Los Angeles Clippers, whose home is Intuit Dome, will cover expenses related to the benefit.\n\nFireAid is being produced by Shelli and Irving Azoff and the Azoff family, with Live Nation and AEG Presents.\n\nFor more information, see FireAidLA.org.",

            "content": "The hours leading up to UFC 311, the first PPV of 2025 for the world's premier mixed martial arts league, stole the spotlight from everything else. The back injury, while dropping his last few pounds, to Arman Tsarukyan cut short the first big fight of the new year.Islam Makhachev, the lightweight champion, will headline against Renato Moicano, a last-minute replacement. And what was going to be a party, sadly, in the ultra-modern Intuit Dome changes its tone. The octagon will be the one to say whether the show changes or if it will still be a night to remember.\n\nAs a wrapper, the night will be unbeatable. UFC 311 will be the landing, finally, at the Intuit Dome. And that is a spectacle in itself. If after the summer of 2024 the company premiered the Las Vegas Sphere on Mexican night, the new Californian pavilion is not far behind. It is less groundbreaking, but it is probably the best representative of the stadiums of the future. It has everything and aims to host the best events on the planet. Olympic Games, All-Star Games, concerts...\n\nSteve Bellmer gave the Clippers Nation a huge welcome to their new home Intuit Dome\n\nThe home of the Clippers in the NBA is set to radically change the game. It cost around $2 billion and is headlined by an incredible double-sided digital screen called the 'Halo Board'. Its extension includes five basketball courts, a swimming pool, a plaza with bars, restaurants and shops. And those who can go will not have to worry about many things, as there is a charger in every seat in the venue and 1,400 toilets. No one will have to queue here. Nor for drinking and eating, as there is a system to offer food without having to wait.\n\nIn addition, it will have eyes on it as the first major event in Los Angeles after the terrible fires that hit the heart of the city. The UFC considered changing venues and moving to its usual T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, but the show went on in Los Angeles. There was a lot at stake, although without Tsarukyan there will be less expectation. Number 1, Islam Makhachev, is the overwhelming favorite in a new defense of his world championship belt.\n\nFor the Intuit Dome, there will also be another fight. The fight to excite the fans. The Las Vegas Sphere changed the game and between each fight a kind of movie was projected that drove the fans crazy. If Los Angeles wants to live up to that, it will have to go big at UFC 311. Time will tell",

But he soon got his timing down and clocked Hill with a left hand that knocked him down.\n\nProchazka, frequently switching from southpaw to orthodox, went on to dominate the rest of the round, landing a total of 30 shots, compared to 17 from Hill.\n\nHill rallied and started the second round strong with a leg kick to the head. But 75 seconds into the frame, the action was halted when Prochazka poked Hill in the eye. After a brief break, the fight continued and Hill immediately clocked Prochazka with a right uppercut.\n\nSeconds later, it was Hill this time who accidentally poked Prochazka in the eye. Physicians entered the cage to inspect the health of the wincing Prochazka, who clapped his hands to indicate he was ready to resume battle. Beltran warned both fighters to keep the action clean.\n\nAs the round continued, both fighters unleashed calculated shots, one punch at a time, and it was Hill who got the better of the action by the end of the round. Hill outlanded Prochazka 30 to 21 in the second.\n\nOne minute into the third, however, Prochazka blasted Hill on the chin. Moments later, he knocked him down, and then once more again, and then pounced to deliver a series of unanswered shots to the head of the bloodied and battered Hill to end the encounter.\n\nProchazka said after the fight that he must improve his defense and then called out Pereira, who was sitting in the first row.\n\nPereira knocked out Prochazka in two rounds to take the title from him in 2023 and then defended it in June via a second-round KO.",

If it gets too bad. But as of now? It\u2019s all go. The NBA is gonna go this week. We are gonna go.\u201d\n\nThe LA Clippers beat the Miami Heat 109-98 in an NBA match at the Intuit Dome on Tuesday.\n\nThe LA Lakers also played at the Crypto.com Arena on Tuesday, losing 126-102 to the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nAs well as the comments from the UFC boss, the California State Athletic Commission has also spoken about the situation.\n\nThey said: \u201cWe are watching the ongoing wildfires and the subsequent emergency and disaster response in the Los Angeles area.\n\n'It's gone forever' - LA soccer star Ali Riley crushed by devastating impact of wildfires\n\n\u201cOur hearts are with the residents of the region, and we appreciate the efforts of first responders in keeping the community safe.\n\n\u201cAt this time, no decisions have been made about moving UFC 311, but we will continue to work with state and local officials and the UFC to determine the best course of action.\u201d\n\nSince then, nothing has changed, so UFC 311 is taking place in Los Angeles.\n\nThe BBC have reported that the winds that have fanned the wildfires are 'expected to kick up' this week.\n\nForecasters have again cautioned 'extreme fire danger' in the north-west of the city centre with the Intuit Dome located around 20 miles south of the Palisades fire which is still burning.\n\nShould it go ahead as planned, UFC 311 will get started at 11pm UK time before the preliminary fights start at 1am on Sunday morning.\n\nThe main card, which included two title fights, ae expected to get going at around 3am on Sunday UK time.\n\nIslam Makhachev will defend his UFC lightweight title against Renato Moicano while Merab Dvalishvili aims to keep his bantamweight belt against Umar Nurmagomedov.",

            "content": "UFC has plans to make use of the unique tech capabilities of Intuit Dome on Saturday when it brings UFC 311 to the new venue in Inglewood, California.\n\nFor Craig Borsari, UFC\u2019s Chief Content Officer and Executive Producer, that begins with the arena\u2019s 38,375-square-foot, double-sided Halo Board, which UFC is working with digital agency Spinifex Group to program with more than 100 4K creative elements. Those elements will include everything from bespoke animations for fighter walkouts and decisions to live stats and betting odds over the course of their seven-hour show.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to feel like a sportsbook at times,\u201d Borsari told SBJ in a phone interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s such an amazing technology \u2013 and real estate \u2013 for us to tap into. We\u2019re going to try to strike that right balance between offering up the right visuals, but also information to enhance the experience for fans, both in attendance and at home watching on broadcast.\u201d\n\nBorsari added that UFC will \u201clean into the Halo as a broadcast element\u201d using a four-point cable cam system, additional RF Steadicam, and additional fish-eye camera (to capture wide shots). They will also bring in an interior and exterior drone for unique shots, as WWE, its sister company under the TKO Group umbrella, did for its \u201cMonday Night Raw\u201d Netflix debut at Intuit Dome earlier this month.\n\nBorsari and several UFC executives attended \u201cRaw,\u201d taking note of the way WWE leveraged the space. \u201cWe were joking about, \u2018Okay, now you guys are going to have to top us,\u201d said WWE VP/Line Producer Brian Fadem. \u201cWe like that friendly competition. And I think it was very collaborative, in a way, as well.\u201d\n\nBorsari\u2019s takeaways from that experience centered on the granular; mainly, how to size picture-in-picture replays displayed on the Halo board.\n\nBut with the Halo Board\u2019s multi-faceted capabilities come some contingencies. UFC as of now does not have firm plans to deploy the t-shirt cannons attached to the board \u2013 WWE fired off more than 100 during their event in a unique activation, according to Fadem \u2013 but could use them to accentuate a fighter decision by, say, blasting CO2.\n\n\u201cIt has to be the right moment,\u201d Borsari said. \u201cWe won\u2019t overdo it with that, but there could be a cool moment to tap into that. We\u2019ll be ready to.\u201d\n\nThe Halo Board, however, is just one of several unique elements to the Intuit Dome. Another is its seating. The armrests of the arena\u2019s 17,000 seats are embedded with programmable LED lights, courtesy of PixMob, which UFC will use at flashpoint moments.\n\n\u201cWe have programmed lighting cues throughout the entire night,\u201d Borsari said. \u201cFrom fighter walkouts to fighter decisions, to the top of the pay-per-view show when we welcome everybody on the broadcast, to title fight announcements from Bruce Buffer.\u201d\n\nUFC has also developed interactive trivia programming that could display on the Halo Board throughout the evening, if there are sufficient breaks between fights. Fans would participate in the games via four-button controllers also attached to each seat.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on,\u201d Borsari said. \u201cWe have a dedicated team \u2013 a producer, a technical director \u2013 that will be sitting in the Intuit [Dome] control room, that\u2019s going to be operating and in close communication with our TV truck, to execute this in a way that is going to be impactful for everybody in every seat inside Intuit [Dome] \u2013 but also you\u2019ll see some new things on broadcast as well.\u201d",

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nIntuit's Annual General Meeting to take place on 23rd of January\n\nTotal pay for CEO Sasan Goodarzi includes US$1.20m salary\n\nTotal compensation is 188% above industry average\n\nIntuit's total shareholder return over the past three years was 17% while its\n\nCEO Sasan Goodarzi has done a decent job of delivering relatively good performance at Intuit Inc. ( ) recently. This is something shareholders will keep in mind as they cast their votes on company resolutions such as executive remuneration in the upcoming AGM on 23rd of January. However, some shareholders may still be hesitant of being overly generous with CEO compensation.\n\nComparing Intuit Inc.'s CEO Compensation With The Industry\n\nAt the time of writing, our data shows that Intuit Inc. has a market capitalization of US$170b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$37m for the year to July 2024. That's a notable increase of 34% on last year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at US$1.2m.\n\nOn comparing similar companies in the with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, we found that the median total CEO compensation was US$13m. This suggests that Sasan Goodarzi is paid more than the median for the industry. What's more, Sasan Goodarzi holds US$23m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.\n\nComponent 2024 2023 Proportion (2024) Salary US$1.2m US$1.1m 3% Other US$35m US$26m 97% Total Compensation US$37m US$27m 100%\n\nSpeaking on an industry level, nearly 15% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 85% is other remuneration. Intuit has chosen to walk a path less trodden, opting to compensate its CEO with less of a traditional salary and more non-salary rewards over the last year. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.\n\nA Look at Intuit Inc.'s Growth Numbers\n\nIntuit Inc. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 11% a year over the past three years. It achieved revenue growth of 12% over the last year.\n\nOverall this is a positive result for shareholders, showing that the company has improved in recent years. It's a real positive to see this sort of revenue growth in a single year. That suggests a healthy and growing business. Looking ahead, you might want to check .\n\nHas Intuit Inc. Been A Good Investment?\n\nIntuit Inc. has generated a total shareholder return of 17% over three years, so most shareholders would be reasonably content. But they would probably prefer not to see CEO compensation far in excess of the median.\n\nTo Conclude...\n\nIntuit primarily uses non-salary benefits to reward its CEO. The company's decent performance might have made most shareholders happy, possibly making CEO remuneration the least of the concerns to be discussed in the upcoming AGM. However, if the board proposes to increase the compensation, some shareholders might have questions given that the CEO is already being paid higher than the industry.\n\nWhile CEO pay is an important factor to be aware of, there are other areas that investors should be mindful of as well. That's why we did some digging and identified that investors should think about before committing capital to this stock.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a different set of stocks.

            "content": "Intuit (INTU) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software have returned -4.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Intuit falls in, has lost 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Intuit is expected to post earnings of $2.59 per share, indicating a change of -1.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.27 points to a change of +13.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.97 indicates a change of +14% from what Intuit is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Intuit.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Intuit, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.83 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. For the current and next fiscal years, $18.27 billion and $20.5 billion estimates indicate +12.2% and +12.2% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIntuit reported revenues of $3.28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.2%. EPS of $2.50 for the same period compares with $2.47 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.14 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.58%. The EPS surprise was +5.93%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIntuit is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuit. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nJust Released: Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2025\n\nHurry \u2013 you can still get in early on our 10 top tickers for 2025.

            "content": "By Amanda Thompson\n\nAccounting professionals are well aware of the challenges their small business clients face, regardless of the industry, geographical location, or economic climate. The 2025 Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index Annual Report offers valuable insights that can help you not only assist your clients in achieving their goals, but also provide strategic advice on a range of issues.\n\nHere are six insights from the report to consider as you guide clients through 2025.\n\nDebt Sources Shift: Short-Term Growth and Long-Term Risks\n\nSmall businesses, often seen as higher-risk borrowers, are finding it increasingly difficult to access credit, and when they do, it comes at a higher cost. The 2024 report highlighted a critical trend: Credit cards were a primary source of financing for small businesses, surpassing all other forms of financing. Entrepreneurs were not only using credit cards more frequently, but also carrying higher balances and incurring greater interest payments. This year\u2019s report shows that credit card use as an essential source of financing remains unchanged and delves deeper into the long-term shift in the small business credit market. Traditional long-term borrowing from financial institutions continues to be increasingly replaced by credit cards and fintech lenders, leading to unique challenges, particularly as small businesses face the largest unexpected interest rate hikes in two decades.\n\nMarcus Dillon, owner and founder of Dillon Business Advisors, and a member of the Intuit Partner Council, emphasizes the impact of this trend.\n\n\u201cWhen small business owners allocate more budget to loan and interest payments, less cash flow is available for investing in new team members, technology, or marketing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe significant year-over-year decline in U.S. small business employment, the largest since 2015, underscores the impact of higher interest rates and inflation on hiring. Small business owners must closely monitor these factors to determine the best path for revenue growth and profitability.\u201d\n\nDebt management, forecasting, and ensuring compliance with loan companies will become increasingly important advisory topics for accountants in the coming years, and helping them navigate these challenges will be crucial for their long-term success.\n\nBanking is Center Stage\n\nAccountants should be well-versed in how their clients\u2019 preferred banks are positioned, because traditional banks have reduced their supply of longer-term loans and diversified their offerings with more credit card products. The report reveals that small businesses working with banks whose finances were not improved by higher interest rates received less access to financing compared to those working with banks whose finances improved.\n\nClients look to you for banking advice, so the options available to your clients from their preferred banking partners\u2014especially those often viewed as higher-risk borrowers\u2014can significantly impact a loan. Some banks have managed to sustain negative impacts from higher interest rates by offering higher credit card limits to their small business customers. However, this may introduce longer-term risks to your clients. Managing debt and cash flow will be key to their success.\n\nHiring Post-Pandemic Remains Fluid\n\nSmall business owners have become more risk-averse in their hiring and investment decisions. Despite improvements in inflation and revenue, the Small Business Index shows employment numbers for small businesses are still below pre-pandemic levels in some sectors and regions.\n\nFinancing has allowed businesses to continue hiring based on short-term cash infusions. However, payroll advisory will be a critical area of growth for firms as clients assess how to address staffing concerns. You can play a vital role in helping clients navigate these challenges by providing strategic advice on hiring and payroll management.\n\nTechnology = Adaptability\n\nTechnology has emerged as a crucial buffer, enabling small businesses to adapt quickly to challenges and the marketplace; in fact, the Index shows that the pandemic demonstrated that tech-enabled businesses are more resilient. For example, small businesses using cash flow reporting, management applications, and e-commerce tools experienced faster growth by early 2021 compared to those lacking such resources.

Milwaukee Ave., will now be known simply as Intuit Art Museum when it reopens April 25, during the EXPO Chicago art fair.\n\nThe rebranding comes in tandem with a massive overhaul of the museum\u2019s public spaces, which will include new galleries, a revamp of its Henry Darger room, a dedicated education and art-making area, an updated gift shop and an accessible entrance as part of a retrofitted front facade.\n\nThe project, years in the making, got a significant boost in 2022 when the museum was awarded a $5 million Chicago Recovery Grant.\n\nIntuit has called its current West Town building home since 1999, and frequently mounts exhibits by artists and makers who are self-taught outside of traditional academic and art world settings and often come from marginalized backgrounds. The museum has been closed for construction since September 2023.\n\nThe goal of the renovation is to offer a larger platform to those artists, as well as more opportunities for visitors to engage with the museum\u2019s permanent and rotating exhibitions, Intuit President and CEO Debra Kerr said in an interview Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOur guests would come in and they look around and say, \u2018Wow, this is incredible. Where\u2019s more?\u2019 So we\u2019re going to be responding to the needs of the community,\u201d she said. \u201cThis art is all about opening a door to art made by people who have incredible, lived experiences and stories to tell through their art.\u201d\n\nA sketch of the Henry Darger Room replica at Intuit Art Museum in West Town. Credit: Provided\n\nThe \u201cCenter for Learning and Engagement Opportunities\u201d at Intuit will act as a space for visitors to interact and learn more about the art on display. Credit: Provided\n\nPrior to the renovations, Intuit\u2019s permanent collection was rarely on display, Kerr said. After the reopening, however, the entire first-floor gallery space will showcase pieces owned by the museum. Two galleries upstairs will be dedicated to special exhibitions.\n\nAlso on view will be one of Intuit\u2019s central offerings: a recreation of the Lincoln Park room where artist Henry Darger lived and worked for most of his life. Darger is known for his imaginative drawings and writings that were discovered following his death in the \u201970s.\n\nAfter the renovation is complete, visitors will again be able to view Darger\u2019s furniture, supplies and materials up close, as well as a new interpretive exhibit on his work and life.\n\nLarge windows are being added along Intuit\u2019s front entrance so passersby can see into the space \u2014 a purposeful gesture to make the museum more welcoming, especially compared to its previous brick facade, Kerr said.\n\nA new ramp and elevator are also being installed in the museum, which is technically spread over three connected buildings, two of which date to the 1870s.\n\n\u201cWe want [people] to be able to be comfortable coming into our space, no matter what their situation is and what their abilities are,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThis is a space for everyone.\u201d\n\nIntuit\u2019s former facade at 756 N. Milwaukee Ave. in West Town as seen in 2022. Credit: Quinn Myers/Block Club Chicago\n\nIntuit is also building a dedicated area for events, classes and other activities called the Center for Learning and Engagement Opportunities, or CLEO, named after Cleo Wilson, one of the museum\u2019s founders.\n\nKerr said the goal of the space is to encourage visitors to stick around and further engage with the museum\u2019s art and other offerings.\n\n\u201cThink members lounge for every guest, where you can come in, hang out, look at books, watch films, have a beverage,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some comfy chairs, and they\u2019ll just have a space where they can hang out and learn more, or maybe bump into another visitor and talk to them about what they experienced, or talk to our staff about what they experienced.\u201d\n\nThe $5 million awarded to Intuit by the city in 2022 was one of hundreds of federally funded community development grants designed to spur economic activity after the pandemic. The museum raised an additional $5 million through private donors, according to a press release.\n\nIntuit Art Museum will reopen to the public April 25. Admission is $15, but will be free for people ages 25 and under.\n\nListen to the Block Club Chicago podcast:",

            "content": "After a difficult year in 2024, Intuit Inc.\u2019s 2025 Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index looks to understand challenges and identify solutions. The annual report assesses which sectors have the most and least growth and how these businesses can navigate higher interest rates through financing and technology.\n\nIntuit Inc.\u2019s research utilizes data from across Intuit QuickBooks in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., as well as official statistics from external sources in development with global economist Ufuk Akcigit. Key findings in the report include how high interest rates have been a major growth inhibitor for small businesses with small business employment experiencing its largest decline (year-over-year) since 2015. The sectors hit hardest were revealed as the leisure and hospitality industries.\n\nIntuit QuickBooks report found that over the past 12 months, small business employment declined by 51,200 jobs while revenue declined by $11,850 on average, per small business. However, the data also shows that the most job losses were seen between October 2023 and January 2024. The good news is that since then, declines have slowed, with some movement toward reversing or offsetting those losses.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nSmall businesses have also shown some signs of slow growth following spiked interest rates when they had less access to credit. The businesses that reported working with banks offering greater access to credit have grown a bit faster. The authors of the report said that it is important to note that \u201cthis may also carry longer-term risks, as this growing reliance on credit cards can significantly increase the cost of small business growth and debt repayments.\u201d\n\nFor financing, small businesses have also become increasingly reliant on credit cards \u2014 the number-one source for financing small businesses, according to the report. Between July 2023 and July 2024, the number of small businesses who reported using credit cards for financing doubled from 25 percent to 50 percent. These findings, said the authors of the report, stand as a major challenge for business owners and will continue to make it difficult for small businesses to create new jobs and grow.\n\n\u201cThe acceleration of small business credit card usage has put owners in a difficult position,\u201d said Akcigit, leading global economist and Arnold C. Harberger professor of economics at the University of Chicago. \u201cWhile they can cover expenses in the short term, the high interest rates are inhibiting their growth in the long run as businesses focus on paying off past debts rather than investing in the future. Mounting credit card debt poses major risks to both small businesses and the greater economy, and we have already seen it have grave impacts on their ability to hire and retain talent.\u201d\n\nTechnology has been a bright light for small businesses that have been able to adopt digital tools that have evolved to fit their needs. Notably, within the U.S. businesses that use at least eight digital tools to manage their business, Intuit QuickBooks found that 67 percent report seeing productivity gains and 45 percent report increased revenue. The top three benefits of utilizing digital tools were revealed as efficiency, accuracy and cost savings.\n\nThe authors of the report said that while growth for small businesses will not be a straight line, those that \u201cmake the most of digital tools to manage their business operations are the most likely to report higher productivity, higher revenue and higher levels of confidence in their future sales forecasts.\u201d\n\nColin Twomey, vice president of growth & analytics at Intuit QuickBooks, added \u201csmall business success is vital to a healthy economy. While hurdles like credit card debt are evident, technology offers a way to reduce costs and fuel new channels for financial prosperity. Intuit remains committed to delivering the kinds of tools and data-backed insights that help propel small businesses forward.\u201d",

            "content": "When she was hired as its president and CEO, Debra Kerr dreamed of transforming Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art into a more welcoming museum.\n\nA decade later, her vision is now a reality. Following a $10 million renovation, the West Town venue announced Wednesday that it will officially reopen on Aprl 25 as the Intuit Art Museum. Having tripled its footprint, the approximately 18,000-square-foot space will now boast a glass storefront, multiple exhibition galleries, an education and art studio, a community gathering space, accessibility upgrades and more.\n\nClosed since September 2023, the museum will mark its return with multiple events, including a grand reopening party on April 26 and a panel on April 27 at Expo Chicago at Navy Pier.\n\nThe Intuit Art Museum\u2019s rendering of its new studio space Courtesy of the Intuit Art Museum\n\nKerr said she hopes the changes will grow the institution\u2019s audience, exposing visitors to the self-taught \u2014 and often overlooked \u2014 artists it champions.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that used to happen is people would come in and they\u2019d see the exhibits and go, \u2018Where\u2019s the rest of it? We want more,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re giving our guests the \u2018more\u2019 that they asked for.\u201d\n\nIntuit Art Museum achieved its new look with a $5 million City of Chicago Community Development Grant, as well as other contributions to its \u201cJust Imagine!\u201d capital campaign. Its new name reflects its identity as a museum instead of a center, as well as its commitment to artists.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of pushback against the term \u2018outsider art,\u2019\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt\u2019s intended to designate someone who works outside the mainstream. But when you read that term, a lot of artists feel like that is othering them.\u201d\n\nThe Intuit Art Museum\u2019s rendering of its new Darger Room, which is part of the two-floor Duchossois Family Henry Darger Exhibition.

Courtesy of the Intuit Art Museum\n\nWalking into the museum at 756 N. Milwaukee Ave., visitors will take note of a new entrance ramp, passenger elevator, interior staircases and exposed, 150-year-old brick. Among the galleries, one will be dedicated to the museum\u2019s rarely seen permanent collection, two will feature special exhibitions, and the fourth will be a flexible space. The venue also has reimagined its Duchossois Family Henry Darger Exhibition, named for the famous Chicago artist. Visitors can explore his art and writings in the Darger Gallery, and then view his personal objects in the Darger Room on the floor below.\n\nKerr said she was especially excited about the new community space for learning and engagement.\n\n\u201cThink of a members lounge for every guest,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be a beverage station, books, movies to watch, a storytelling booth and an art-making station. There will be staff in there to help you learn more about the art or just hang out and talk with people about the art.\u201d\n\nThe Intuit Art Museum\u2019s rendering of its new center for learning and engagement opportunities. Courtesy of the Intuit Art Museum\n\nThe museum\u2019s inaugural special exhibition will showcase works from immigrant artists. Like others featured in the museum, they may not have had the same opportunities as others in the field.\n\n\u201cAll these artists couldn\u2019t go to art school and didn\u2019t know that was a possibility for them because of economic or social or geographic reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were so compelled to make art to share their lived experiences. I think that\u2019s powerful.\u201d\n\nChicago is a fitting location for the Intuit Art Museum, founded in 1991, because the city has long embraced self-taught artists, Kerr said. And by coordinating its reopening with Expo Chicago, she hopes to draw more people to the venue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the few museums in the world that focuses exclusively on this art,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Expo\u2019s bringing in all these guests from around the country and around the world, and they\u2019re going to have an opportunity to see a brand new art museum \u2014 a brand new jewel in Chicago\u2019s crown. And we\u2019re excited about that.\u201d\n\nThe museum\u2019s new regular hours will be 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday and 8 p.m. every third Thursday. Admission is $15 or free for members, visitors 25 and under, and those unable to pay.",

The bill would sunset in 2030.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom signed AB 3206 into law in September 2024 noting it could lead to an increase in driving under the influence related crashes and fatalities.\n\n\u201cI am directing California Highway Patrol to work with local agencies to track DUI incidents in the surrounding communities and to prepare a report on the impact of extended alcohol service hours that can inform the Legislature\u2019s evaluation of any further proposals to extend alcohol service.\u201d\n\nThe planning commission\u2019s approval came with conditions related to AB 3206 which include the sales must occur in a private area in the arena no larger than 2,500 square feet, must be available only to members of a private club, maximum capacity of 100 persons, restricted to patrons 21 years of age and older and must occur in the hours immediately following a day on which a sporting event, concert or other major event has occurred in the arena.\n\nCommissioner David Rice asked if staff knew of the number of private rooms and how many private clubs would be allowed.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t decided where the private club will be but they do have to go through building safety for the tenant improvement and that\u2019s when we will see exactly where the club will be,\u201d said planner Christine Rivera.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Gerard McCallum who explained it is a pilot program that would eventually happen statewide and would sunset in 2030.\n\n\u201cIt will be in a limited, one space, that we are still in the process of determining as the dome is still under construction,\u201d said McCallum.\n\n\u201cThe idea behind why this club is because it is a state of the art NBA arena, from the way it operates is very efficient, using facial ID and we want to bring this type of exclusivity to the city of Inglewood and we are taking this access very seriously.\u201d\n\nThe City noted the Intuit Dome was issued a temporary Certificate of Occupancy on November 26, 2024.\n\nThe planning commission\u2019s approved the application 4-0 which now sends the application to the city council for final approval.",

            "content": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU), the global financial technology platform that makes Intuit TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, released the findings of its 2025 Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index Annual Report. Developed in collaboration with leading global economist University of Chicago Professor Ufuk Akcigit and his co-authors, the report reveals how high interest rates were a growth inhibitor for small businesses as US small business employment experienced its largest year-over-year decline in 2024 since 2015, with the leisure and hospitality industries hardest hit.\n\nFresh Insights on US Small Businesses\n\nWhile overall employment is rising in the US, small business growth is lagging, indicating that jobs are moving from small businesses to larger businesses. The report found that small business employment declined by 51,200 jobs over the past 12 months while revenue declined by $11,850 per small business, on average. This was the largest year-over-year decline in employment since 2015 and the third consecutive year-over-year decline in revenue. And on an annual basis, all 12 sectors and four of the eight US regions the study covers show declining employment from October 2023 to October 2024.\n\nLooking more closely at the monthly data over that period, however, reveals that most of the job losses occurred between October 2023 and January 2024. Since then, the declines have generally slowed or even reversed\u2014offsetting some of the earlier job losses. For example, while the construction sector lost 13,100 jobs at the end of 2023, it created 11,400 jobs at small businesses in 2024.\n\nOverall, small businesses grew more slowly after the spike in interest rates if they had less access to credit. Those that were hit the hardest had up to 30% lower revenue growth and 4% lower employment growth compared to other small businesses. Meanwhile, small businesses working with banks that were able to offer greater access to credit have been able to grow faster\u2014at least in the short term. However, this may also carry longer-term risks, as this growing reliance on credit cards can significantly increase the cost of small business growth and debt repayments.\n\nRising Credit Card Usage Creates Short Term Gains and Long Term Risks\n\nSmall businesses are becoming more reliant on credit cards, which remain the number one source of small business financing. The number of small businesses using credit cards for financing doubled between July 2023 (25%) and July 2024 (50%). Despite providing short term gains and quick access to capital, credit card usage as a primary form of business financing creates long-term financial risks associated with carrying higher balances and incurring greater interest payments. In 2024 alone, credit card interest payments among US small businesses rose by 14%. This follows a 1.5-times increase from 2022 to 2023 in the percentage of small businesses paying over $450 in interest alone on their credit cards each month. The rising costs of borrowing money coupled with limited access to capital with traditional lenders is making it more difficult for small businesses to create new jobs and grow.\n\n\u201cThe acceleration of small business credit card usage has put owners in a difficult position,\u201d says Ufuk Akcigit, leading global economist and Arnold C. Harberger Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago. \u201cWhile they can cover expenses in the short term, the high interest rates are inhibiting their growth in the long run as businesses focus on paying off past debts rather than investing in the future. Mounting credit card debt poses major risks to both small businesses and the greater economy, and we have already seen it have grave impacts on their ability to hire and retain talent.\u201d\n\nDigital Tools are Critical for Growth and Productivity\n\nAs technology continues to evolve and proliferate, adoption of digital tools within small businesses has increased - with positive impacts on their bottom line. Among US businesses that use eight or more digital tools to manage their business, 67% saw productivity gains and 45% reported increased revenue. These results are significantly higher than businesses with lower digital adoption; for comparison, among small businesses using two or fewer digital tools, only 36% reported higher productivity and only 30% reported higher revenue.\n\nOn top of the immediate gains, higher use of digital tools has also helped small businesses to create stronger revenue forecasts and boosted confidence in future sales. For example, 72% of high users of digital tools feel confident in their sales projections compared to only 50% of low-users of digital tools.\n\n\u201cSmall business success is vital to a healthy economy,\u201d says Colin Twomey, Vice President of Growth & Analytics at Intuit QuickBooks. \u201cWhile hurdles like credit card debt are evident, technology offers a way to reduce costs and fuel new channels for financial prosperity. Intuit remains committed to delivering the kinds of tools and data-backed insights that help propel small businesses forward.\u201d\n\nA More Holistic View of Small Business Health\n\nOne of the great strengths of this report is its well-rounded look at small business health. Small business growth is not a straight line, and the continued expansion of data points considered in the annual report allows for more nuanced analysis of the landscape. QuickBooks customer Judd Robertson, president at Mighty Pine Heating, Cooling, Plumbing & Electric in Colorado, explains that for his business, signs of growth don't necessarily all appear at once.\n\n\"We're making investments in the foundation of Mighty Pine\u2014hiring a new customer service person, hiring a new person to deal with the rebates. That takes our margin away, but it supports our employees in the field,\" Robertson says. He sees these investments as laying the foundation for sustainable growth\u2014and as promising signs for the year ahead. \"We could not be here today if we didn't have the internal team members that were able to [hire]. I think we're going to thrive in 2025, and that's because of the folks we have under our roof.\"\n\nAs many business owners prepare for the year ahead, this report offers a comprehensive look at the trends and advancements that could continue to impact their growth.\n\nFor more insights, check out the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index Annual Report here.

Harberger Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago), Raman Singh Chhina (PhD Researcher, University of Chicago), Seyit M. Cilasun (Professor of Economics, TED University), Javier Miranda (Head of the Center for Business and Productivity Dynamics, Halle Institute for Economic Research), and Nicolas Serrano-Velarde (Professor of Finance, Bocconi University). The analysis uses the following data sources:\n\nIntuit QuickBooks Small Business Index: employment and revenue trends among small businesses in the US, Canada, and the UK from October 2023 to October 2024, based on a total worldwide sample of 557,000 small businesses. Full methodology details available here. Note: the Index does not reflect the QuickBooks customer base or Intuit\u2019s business.\n\n\n\nIntuit QuickBooks customer data: anonymised, aggregated, and benchmarked or reweighted to reflect the wider population of small businesses in the US, Canada, and UK (not the QuickBooks customer base or Intuit\u2019s business) to provide new insight into small business access to credit, credit card expenditure, payments against credit card balances, and interest payments between 2019 and 2024. Samples: 249,000 US small businesses with 0-100 employees with credit card data recorded in QuickBooks from 2019 to 2024 (Figures 52 and 53) and 677,000 US small businesses with 0-100 employees with credit card data recorded in QuickBooks in 2022 and 2023 (Figure 54). Full methodology available in the report.\n\n\n\nIntuit QuickBooks Small Business Insights: quarterly online surveys, commissioned by Intuit QuickBooks, of more than 5,000 small businesses (0-100 employees) in the US, Canada, and UK.

(Nasdaq: INTU), the global financial technology platform that makes Intuit TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, released the findings of its 2025 Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index Annual Report. Developed in collaboration with leading global economist University of Chicago Professor Ufuk Akcigit and his co-authors, the report reveals how high interest rates were a growth inhibitor for small businesses as US small business employment experienced its largest year-over-year decline in 2024 since 2015, with the leisure and hospitality industries hardest hit.\n\nFresh Insights on US Small Businesses\n\nWhile overall employment is rising in the US, small business growth is lagging, indicating that jobs are moving from small businesses to larger businesses. The report found that small business employment declined by 51,200 jobs over the past 12 months while revenue declined by $11,850 per small business, on average. This was the largest year-over-year decline in employment since 2015 and the third consecutive year-over-year decline in revenue. And on an annual basis, all 12 sectors and four of the eight US regions the study covers show declining employment from October 2023 to October 2024.\n\nLooking more closely at the monthly data over that period, however, reveals that most of the job losses occurred between October 2023 and January 2024. Since then, the declines have generally slowed or even reversed\u2014offsetting some of the earlier job losses. For example, while the construction sector lost 13,100 jobs at the end of 2023, it created 11,400 jobs at small businesses in 2024.\n\nOverall, small businesses grew more slowly after the spike in interest rates if they had less access to credit. Those that were hit the hardest had up to 30% lower revenue growth and 4% lower employment growth compared to other small businesses. Meanwhile, small businesses working with banks that were able to offer greater access to credit have been able to grow faster\u2014at least in the short term. However, this may also carry longer-term risks, as this growing reliance on credit cards can significantly increase the cost of small business growth and debt repayments.\n\nRising Credit Card Usage Creates Short Term Gains and Long Term Risks\n\nSmall businesses are becoming more reliant on credit cards, which remain the number one source of small business financing. The number of small businesses using credit cards for financing doubled between July 2023 ( 25% ) and July 2024 ( 50% ). Despite providing short term gains and quick access to capital, credit card usage as a primary form of business financing creates long-term financial risks associated with carrying higher balances and incurring greater interest payments. In 2024 alone, credit card interest payments among US small businesses rose by 14% . This follows a 1.5-times increase from 2022 to 2023 in the percentage of small businesses paying over $450 in interest alone on their credit cards each month. The rising costs of borrowing money coupled with limited access to capital with traditional lenders is making it more difficult for small businesses to create new jobs and grow.\n\n\u201cThe acceleration of small business credit card usage has put owners in a difficult position,\u201d says Ufuk Akcigit, leading global economist and Arnold C. Harberger Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago . \u201cWhile they can cover expenses in the short term, the high interest rates are inhibiting their growth in the long run as businesses focus on paying off past debts rather than investing in the future. Mounting credit card debt poses major risks to both small businesses and the greater economy, and we have already seen it have grave impacts on their ability to hire and retain talent.\u201d\n\nDigital Tools are Critical for Growth and Productivity\n\nAs technology continues to evolve and proliferate, adoption of digital tools within small businesses has increased - with positive impacts on their bottom line. Among US businesses that use eight or more digital tools to manage their business, 67% saw productivity gains and 45% reported increased revenue. These results are significantly higher than businesses with lower digital adoption; for comparison, among small businesses using two or fewer digital tools, only 36% reported higher productivity and only 30% reported higher revenue.\n\nOn top of the immediate gains, higher use of digital tools has also helped small businesses to create stronger revenue forecasts and boosted confidence in future sales. For example, 72% of high users of digital tools feel confident in their sales projections compared to only 50% of low-users of digital tools.\n\n\u201cSmall business success is vital to a healthy economy,\u201d says Colin Twomey, Vice President of Growth & Analytics at Intuit QuickBooks. \u201cWhile hurdles like credit card debt are evident, technology offers a way to reduce costs and fuel new channels for financial prosperity. Intuit remains committed to delivering the kinds of tools and data-backed insights that help propel small businesses forward.\u201d\n\nA More Holistic View of Small Business Health\n\nOne of the great strengths of this report is its well-rounded look at small business health. Small business growth is not a straight line, and the continued expansion of data points considered in the annual report allows for more nuanced analysis of the landscape. QuickBooks customer Judd Robertson, president at Mighty Pine Heating, Cooling, Plumbing & Electric in Colorado , explains that for his business, signs of growth don't necessarily all appear at once.\n\n\"We're making investments in the foundation of Mighty Pine\u2014hiring a new customer service person, hiring a new person to deal with the rebates. That takes our margin away, but it supports our employees in the field,\" Robertson says. He sees these investments as laying the foundation for sustainable growth\u2014and as promising signs for the year ahead. \"We could not be here today if we didn't have the internal team members that were able to [hire]. I think we're going to thrive in 2025, and that's because of the folks we have under our roof.\"\n\nAs many business owners prepare for the year ahead, this report offers a comprehensive look at the trends and advancements that could continue to impact their growth.\n\nFor more insights, check out the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index Annual Report here.

Harberger Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago ), Raman Singh Chhina (PhD Researcher, University of Chicago ), Seyit M. Cilasun (Professor of Economics, TED University), Javier Miranda (Head of the Center for Business and Productivity Dynamics, Halle Institute for Economic Research), and Nicolas Serrano-Velarde (Professor of Finance, Bocconi University). The analysis uses the following data sources:\n\nIntuit QuickBooks Small Business Index: employment and revenue trends among small businesses in the US, Canada , and the UK from October 2023 to October 2024, based on a total worldwide sample of 557,000 small businesses. Full methodology details available here. Note: the Index does not reflect the QuickBooks customer base or Intuit\u2019s business.\n\n\n\nIntuit QuickBooks customer data: anonymised, aggregated, and benchmarked or reweighted to reflect the wider population of small businesses in the US, Canada , and UK (not the QuickBooks customer base or Intuit\u2019s business) to provide new insight into small business access to credit, credit card expenditure, payments against credit card balances, and interest payments between 2019 and 2024. Samples: 249,000 US small businesses with 0-100 employees with credit card data recorded in QuickBooks from 2019 to 2024 (Figures 52 and 53) and 677,000 US small businesses with 0-100 employees with credit card data recorded in QuickBooks in 2022 and 2023 (Figure 54). Full methodology available in the report.\n\n\n\nIntuit QuickBooks Small Business Insights: quarterly online surveys, commissioned by Intuit QuickBooks, of more than 5,000 small businesses (0-100 employees) in the US, Canada , and UK . The report uses the July 2024 wave of these surveys, with a total sample of 5,183 respondents (comprising 3,012 in the US; 1,013 in Canada ; and 1,158 in the UK ).

(More on that later.)\n\nRelated: H&R Block Faces Hefy $7 million FTC Fine\n\nIRS Direct File program\n\nLast year, the IRS completed its Direct File pilot for the 2024 tax filing season.\n\nTwelve states, mostly those without income tax (Arizona, California, Florida, New Hampshire, New York, Nevada, Massachusetts, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming) were part of the initial limited 2024 program.\n\nThe agency says 70% of taxpayers surveyed expressed interest in a free IRS-provided tool for preparing and filing taxes.\n\nIRS data revealed that people spend an average of about $250 to prepare their taxes.\n\nAs mentioned, for the current 2025 tax filing season, the following 25 states will participate in the IRS Direct File program.\n\nAlaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming\n\nThe IRS estimates that over 30 million taxpayers within these 25 states will qualify to use Direct File in 2025.\n\nNot the same as Free File\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that this is not IRS Free File. The proposed Direct File service would be different from IRS Free File. (That program is designed for people with income under $84,000 for the 2024 tax year.)\n\nOn the other hand, this IRS-run tax prep and filing service will ultimately be available to a wider range of taxpayers with generally uncomplicated returns and incomes up to around $200,000. The agency says it is designed to be as easy or easier to use than traditional tax prep software. But like IRS Free File, the IRS Direct File tax prep service is also electronic and free.\n\nIn addition to considering the feasibility of a Direct File system, a key IRS report focuses on taxpayer opinions and costs and contains independent analysis.\n\nAccording to the report, potential benefits and challenges associated with the implementation by the IRS of a Direct File program include:\n\nImproved experience and cost savings for some taxpayers who currently spend money to file their taxes either with accountants or using tax preparation software.\n\nOperational challenges like having in-house technical expertise and sufficient customer service to support Direct File.\n\nEventually, the IRS will also have to figure out how to coordinate with more states \u2014 many taxpayers are used to filing their state and federal taxes at the same time.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also a question of trust. The agency acknowledges that taxpayers may question IRS motives in offering a Direct File tool. People also worry about the tool impacting IRS audits and future tax enforcement.\n\nThe IRS indicates that younger people who prepare their own tax returns might be interested in Direct File.\n\nAdditionally, according to the report, taxpayers who were shown a \u201cfunctioning internal prototype of Direct File, developed for research purposes, reported that the software exceeded their expectations in terms of ease of use and simplicity.\u201d\n\nIRS Direct file a threat to TurboTax and H&R Block?\n\nIntuit, maker of TurboTax, previously indicated that a potential IRS tax prep service could pose a business threat. In past SEC filings, the company reportedly wrote, \u201cWe anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Intuit settled a lawsuit over allegations that the company \u201ctricked\u201d taxpayers into paying for its tax software when they thought they were receiving a free version. However, as Kiplinger previously reported, in agreeing to the $144 million TurboTax settlement, Intuit did not admit wrongdoing.\n\nEarlier last year, the FTC found Intuit TurboTax engaged in deceptive advertising of its tax-free offerings. Intuit reportedly appealed the finding.\n\nMeanwhile, H&R Block was also the subject of an FTC investigation for improper customer data handling and deceptive advertising. The company has previously supported proposed legislation that would have effectively banned the IRS from offering certain tax filing services.\n\nSince the launch and expansion of the IRS Direct File program, the stock prices of Intuit (maker of TurboTax) and H&R Block have experienced some downward pressure.\n\nFor example, in November last year, H&R Block shares tumbled 8.2%, while Intuit shed 5.1% following reports that the incoming Trump administration was considering developing a free tax filing app.\n\nAlso, just before the IRS Direct File pilot report was released, Intuit stock (INTU) fell to its lowest point that month, and H&R Block stock (HRB) was down 4.8%.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s hard to say whether the government-run tax prep service can compete with or harm similar services provided by those companies.\n\nMeanwhile, last year, the IRS announced that the Direct File program will be permanent. But an issue is whether the incoming Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress will maintain the program.\n\nAnd...some will be concerned about the cost of running Direct File. Preliminary estimates indicate that the IRS tax prep service could cost between $64 million and $249 million a year, depending on the number of taxpayers using it.\n\nRelated Content",

He\u2019s looked more impressive in each of his three trips into the UFC Octagon, and he kicks off his second full year on the roster by taking a significant step up in competition this weekend as he squares off with Brazilian veteran Raoni Barcelos.\n\nAfter opening with a third-round submission win over Nick Aguirre that Talbott himself wasn\u2019t overly impressed with, the Dana White\u2019s Contender Series (DWCS) grad opened last year with a second-round stoppage win over Cameron Saaiman, battering the South African prospect throughout the first before putting him away 21 seconds into the middle frame.

            "content": "Intuit CFO Sandeep Aujla threw his support behind the H-1B visa program and pushed back against a protectionist view of the skilled labor market in a recent wide-ranging interview with CFO Dive.\n\n\u201cWhat the H-1B visa allows us to do is continue to invest in the resources in the U.S., as we do, but also have access to global talent,\u201d Aujla said on Jan. 7. \u201cIt\u2019s to make sure that we don't become isolationist as a country when it comes to access to global talent,\u201d he added, noting that he hopes President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration will continue to lean into the program.\n\nThe visa program \u2014 which allows U.S. employers to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations \u2014 has sparked controversy in recent weeks, with critics arguing that it deprioritizes American workers and suppresses wages. Proponents, meanwhile, maintain that the program ensures companies can continue to access a skilled labor pool \u2014 wherever the talent is located.\n\nSandeep Aujla Courtesy of Intuit\n\nWith a view of both talent and software as global, Mountain View, California-based Intuit, a tax preparation and accounting software company, is among the many Silicon Valley companies that use the program to help bring skilled talent to the U.S.\n\nBetween Aug. 1, 2023 and July 31, 2024, Intuit filed 716 H-1B petitions, of which nearly all (715) were approved and 1 was denied, the company told CFO Dive. The total includes new H-1Bs counted against the annual cap, along with H-1B transfer and extension petitions. The congressionally mandated H-1B cap, or limit, is 65,000, along with an additional 20,000 visas allocated to individuals who earned a U.S. master\u2019s degree or higher.\n\nVisas spark MAGA backlash\n\nThe H-1B visa program recently sparked a heated debate on social media among key backers of President-elect Trump, with the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) co-leads Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy voicing support for it. Meanwhile, some conservatives, including former South Carolina governor and former presidential candidate Nikki Haley, rallied against hiring workers from outside the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe should be investing and prioritizing in Americans, not foreign workers,\u201d Haley wrote in an X post late last month.\n\nAujla\u2019s views appear to roughly align with those of Musk, who recently suggested the program is a key tool for hiring critical engineering talent.\n\n\u201cOF COURSE my companies and I would prefer to hire Americans and we DO, as that is MUCH easier than going through the incredibly painful and slow work visa process,\u201d Musk posted on X on Dec. 25. \u201cHOWEVER, there is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America.\u201d\n\nPrepping for the Trump administration\n\nAsked about the company\u2019s broader approach to preparing for the incoming administration, Aujla said Intuit has long worked with both political parties.\n\n\u201cWe have a long history of being bipartisan, and our focus remains on the policies that matter most to our customers, who are consumers and entrepreneurs,\u201d he said.\n\nContributions by the Intuit Inc. 21st Century Leadership Fund (Intuit\u2019s affiliated PAC) are almost evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, with about 49.6% of all contributions during the period allocated to Democratic recipients, and 50.4% of contributions going to Republicans. Federal and state contributions in 2023 and 2024 were similarly spread out, with 49% going to Democrats and 51% going to Republicans, the company told CFO Dive.\n\nA good shot\n\nAujla\u2019s comments come as companies are extending overtures to the incoming Trump administration. Intuit is one of many Big Tech firms, such as Amazon and Meta, contributing to Trump\u2019s second inaugural fund, according to The Wall Street Journal. Intuit contributed $1 million to the fund.\n\n\u201cIntuit is committed to ensuring our customers\u2019 voices are heard on important issues, and our expanded participation in the democratic process reflects our growth as a company and the variety of policy issues that impact the approximately 100 million diverse consumers and businesses we serve,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nTech firms are courting the incoming administration because they believe they have an opportunity to influence the course of immigration reform, including the future of the H1-B program, said Chirag Mehta, vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research.\n\n\u201cThey have a very good shot at lobbying [for] H1-B reforms. There are quite a few ideas being pitched,\u201d he said.\n\nHurdles with the program, from a CFO\u2019s perspective, include the annual limit of 85,000 H1-B visas and the lottery system for selecting successful candidates, he said.\n\n\u201cEven if you can find talent, there are a whole bunch of challenges,\u201d including the risk of paying legal and filing fees with an uncertain likelihood of success, along with the complexity of transitioning H1-B employees to permanent resident status, he added.\n\nCompetition from free tax prep\n\nThe maker of TurboTax and one of the largest players in the tax preparation software market, Intuit is also facing some changes in the sector.\n\nAmid reports that the incoming Trump administration is considering creating a new free tax filing app, Aujla said he was not concerned about potential competition, pointing out that a new free platform from the government won\u2019t affect demand for Intuit\u2019s TurboTax products. But the government\u2019s efforts would be better directed towards making tax filing easier, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are a plethora of free offerings in the marketplace. The government entering this space and coming up with yet another free offering is not going to change the landscape,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say that's not an area where the government needs to expend much energy. Where we would love the government to expend energy is to make the taxes simpler.\u201d\n\nThe company has historically butted heads with free tax-filing programs offered by the government, lobbying against Direct File, an in-house free filing tool offered by the IRS, according to a Reuters report.\n\nIn a statement shared with CFO Dive Friday, a company spokesperson was critical of the IRS offering. \u201cIRS Direct File is a solution in search of a problem and that solution will unnecessarily cost hard-working Americans billions of dollars for something that already exists,\u201d said Derrick Plummer, director of corporate communications at Intuit.\n\nDirect File began as a pilot in 2024 and will be expanded to 25 states for the 2025 tax season, according to a Jan. 10 IRS release. Intuit was previously a part of Free File, a program that allows taxpayers to file their taxes for free through partner firms, since 2003, but exited the program in July 2021.\n\nLooking ahead, Aujla would prefer to work with the incoming administration on simplifying the tax code to improve the experience of filers, he said.\n\n\u201cOur focus is on, on the consumer side, helping [consumers] get access to their biggest paycheck of the year, which for many, is their tax refund,\u201d Aujla said. \u201cLet's help the consumer get access to the money the fastest way possible.\u201d",

            "content": "It\u2019s been more than 40 years since Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics, and as the countdown to 2028 continues the city\u2019s sporting and entertainment arenas are gearing up to provide unique VIP experiences to Angelenos and patrons from around the world.\n\nFrom SoFi Stadium to Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer\u2019s estimated $2-billion Intuit Dome in Inglewood, live viewing options at arenas have evolved considerably over the last decade, with owners dedicating more square footage to luxury suites and premium seating.\n\nScott Spencer, founder and president of San Francisco-based Suite Experience Group, said while these choices were available prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, changing attitudes among consumers in the post-pandemic world have triggered a boom.\n\n\u201cPrior to Covid, some venues were repurposing private luxury suites and installing more club seats in their place,\u201d said Spencer. \u201cBut post-Covid that trend has reversed. Demand for suites is at an all-time high, and venues are once again spending the money to add even more suites as customers value privacy and exclusivity.\u201d\n\nFor example, said Spencer, the Crypto.com Arena recently added two new suite types, including four Tunnel Suites that provide exclusive perks to patrons.\n\n\u201cSimilar to how the airline industry now offers multiple seating tiers starting with basic economy all the way up to first class; stadiums have expanded their options too, with a focus on higher-end customers who are willing to pay more for privacy, premium views and VIP services,\u201d Spencer said.\n\nSpencer said venues are also investing in the purchase experience to drive added revenue.\n\n\u201cSuites have historically been very hard to access, but just as you can buy a Tesla online, you can now buy a luxury suite online at most major venues,\u201d said Spencer.\n\nHe said SEG\u2019s SuitePro software, which powers suite sales for places such as Crypto.com Arena and SoFi Stadium, typically helps venues increase suite sales by a minimum of 20% in year one by making suites more discoverable and easier to purchase.\n\nWhile venues such as SoFi Stadium, Crypto.com Arena and Intuit Dome did not exist during the 1984 Olympics, they are now among the stadiums tapped to showcase various Olympic games in 2028.\n\nInglewood\u2019s SoFi Stadium, the home of the Los Angeles Chargers and Los Angeles Rams, will host the opening and closing ceremonies and its field will be temporarily replaced with an Olympic-sized pool for the swimming competitions.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time a pool has been built in a football stadium.\n\nLast summer, a pool was constructed inside Indianapolis\u2019 Lucas Oil Stadium to accommodate the 2024 Olympic Swimming Trials.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all fans can look forward to at SoFi Stadium.\n\nLeading up to the games, the open-air stadium, which boasts 260 luxury suites and over 13,000 premium seats, will also host eight FIFA World Cup 2026 matches and the SuperBowl LXI in 2027.\n\nIn addition, Crypto.com Arena will be the site of the gymnastics competitions and Intuit Dome, located alongside SoFi, has been selected to house the 2028 basketball games.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for venues that can really deliver on the VIP experience, then L.A. is the perfect market to host the Olympic Games,\u201d said Spencer. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what these venues add to their already strong premium offerings as they cater to well-heeled international clientele.\u201d\n\nBMO Stadium\n\nDesigned by San Francisco-based Gensler, the 22,000-seat BMO Stadium opened in April 2018 and is the home of Major League Soccer\u2019s Los Angeles Football Club and the National Women\u2019s Soccer League\u2019s Angel City Football Club.\n\nLocated in Exposition Park, it anchors the south end of the Figueroa Corridor and includes 125,000 square feet of walkways and plazas that are open to the public.\n\nThe LEED Silver certified building was the first new open-air stadium built in L.A. since Dodgers Stadium was unveiled in 1962.\n\nAt a 34-degree incline, the stadium\u2019s seating is reportedly among the steepest in Major League Soccer. Every seat is within 135 feet of the pitch, and the closest seats are only 12 feet from the touchline.\n\nBMO Stadium has 35 private suites including 10 Field level and 12 Founders level suites. In addition, there are two Party suites on the Founders level, 10 Sunset Deck suites and one Party Suite on the Sunset Deck.\n\nAmenities include an exclusive VIP entrance via the Grand Lobby, VIP parking passes, in-suite flat screen TVs and professional catering options.\n\nThe stadium has a number of premium clubs, such as the Field Club, which boasts an upscale Hollywood feel, with field-level viewing, access to premium seats and all-inclusive food and beverages on regular season LAFC and ACFC match days.\n\nThere\u2019s also the Figueroa Club, which is located on the east side of the stadium and features communal lodge seating, local graffiti art and a private VIP entrance off Figueroa.\n\nOn the mezzanine level, the BMO Founders Club is the most expansive and wide-open club in the stadium, with 14-foot ceilings and midfield views with padded seats. It includes 598 club seats, two large party suites and nine other suites that are available for purchase.\n\nIt\u2019s attached to an exclusive rooftop venue for those who want to host parties.\n\nOther clubs include the 3,559-square-foot Directors Lounge, adjacent to the Field Level Club and the Sunset Deck, which has views of downtown L.A., the Peristyle at USC Coliseum and the Hollywood sign.\n\nAnother fan favorite is the Directors Box, which is located on the mezzanine level. It offers midfield viewing, luxury lounge seating, a private elevator and staircase to the Directors Lounge and all-inclusive food and beverages.\n\nCrypto.com arena\n\nCrypto.com Arena opened its doors in 1999 as the former Staples Center.\n\nLocated in downtown L.A., the eco-friendly arena is the home of the National Basketball Association\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers, the National Hockey League\u2019s Los Angeles Kings and the Women\u2019s National Basketball Association\u2019s Los Angeles Sparks.\n\nThe arena, which is owned and operated by Anschutz Entertainment Group, has a seating capacity of nearly 20,000, including 2,500 club seats. Crypto.com Arena serves as the anchor for the L.A. LIVE sports and entertainment district.\n\nLast fall, AEG completed a three-phase nine-figure multimillion dollar renovation project that started in 2022, increasing its existing 160 premium suites, adding options that enable fans to be lower and closer to the action.\n\nWrapping up in time for its 25th anniversary on Oct. 17, the project included upgrades to the Yaamava\u2019 Club by San Manuel and an expanded Lexus Club along with the exclusive Terrace and Tunnel suites, which were unveiled in 2023.\n\nHidden away from the court and the arena bowl, each of the four 12-person Tunnel Suites offers an ultra-private luxury experience to guests right down to parking.\n\nPatrons can pull up next to the suite entrance under the arena, next to where the players park. The large suites provide easy access to VIP seats in the arena.\n\nThe Terrace Suites, which are easily visible to the bowl, can accommodate up to 14 guests and feature an elevated all-access experience just off the main concourse.\n\nSpencer, of Suite Experience Group, said the suites offer exclusive perks from start to finish.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment guests arrive, they\u2019re treated to VIP amenities and personalized service, ensuring every aspect of their visit feels special,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cWith plush seating, gourmet catering, and a dedicated staff on hand, each suite becomes a luxurious retreat where fans can immerse themselves in the energy of the event while enjoying complete comfort and privacy.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the suites, there is also a new Coke Studio at the arena, thanks to a multiyear partnership between AEG, Coca-Cola North America and Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling.\n\nThe 3,300-square-foot Coke Studio is open to the public and features a recording studio and event space.\n\nOver the years, the arena has hosted countless iconic events. This year marks the 22nd time that the Grammy Awards will be held at the venue.\n\nThe arena has been selected as the site where the men\u2019s and women\u2019s gymnastics competitions will held during the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nDignity Health Sports Park\n\nThe Los Angeles Galaxy soccer team\u2019s home, the $150 million privately financed Dignity Health Sports Park, opened in 2003.\n\nLocated on 125 acres of the campus of California State University, Dominguez Hills in Carson, Dignity Health Sports Park serves as the U.S. Tennis Association\u2019s high-performance training center and the U.S. Soccer Federation\u2019s national team training headquarters.\n\nThe park, formerly known as StubHub Center, was developed and is managed by Anschutz Entertainment Group and includes a 27,000-seat stadium for soccer, football, other sporting events and outdoor concerts and an 8,000-seat tennis stadium.\n\nThere\u2019s also a large track and field facility and an indoor velodrome (the VELO Sports Center) for track cycling. The VELO Sports Center is an official U.S. Olympic and Paralympic training site and is a home track to USA Cycling\u2019s national track cycling program.\n\nThere are 43 luxury suites on the upper and main concourse levels, six event suites and 14 terrace cabanas as well as 1,332 club seats.\n\nStandard main concourse and upper concourse suites come with 12 to 20 and 12 to 16 tickets respectively, with the option to purchase more, and the larger event suites provide 48.\n\nGuests enter the park through a private entrance and the suites offer prime views, climate-controlled areas and come with some preferred parking passes, among other perks.\n\nOne of premium spaces on the site is the Spectrum Tunnel Club, which is available exclusively to LA Galaxy Fieldside Seat Members.\n\nIn December 2024, construction began on a four-year plan to upgrade Dignity Health Sports Park.\n\nThe project entails the re-seating of the entire lower bowl, restroom renovations, refacing concession stands and upgraded premium seats.\n\nNew premium and space highlights include the Fieldside West seats, which will provide the closest viewing point to the field. (https://www.lagalaxy.com/news/dignity-health-sports-park-begins-construction-as-part-of-stadium-refresh-project)\n\nOpen-air and semi-private cabanas on the West Terrace will offer easy access to the Stadium Club and an exclusive catering area, and new flip-down mesh platinum seating at the home side midfield will increase comfort and breathability for fans.\n\nThe first phase is expected to be completed by February.\n\nDignity Health Sports Park will host several Summer Olympics events, including tennis, track cycling, field hockey and the Rugby Sevens.\n\nIntuit Dome\n\nLocated near SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, the 17,800-seat Intuit Dome is the newest of the county\u2019s arenas to offer patrons unique accommodations.\n\nIntuit Dome, which is home to Steve Ballmer\u2019s Los Angeles Clippers, opened in August and reportedly cost at least $2 billion to construct.\n\nAECOM led the design team for Intuit, which according to the website, was built to offer the best sightlines and most legroom in the NBA in both premium locations and the upper bowl AECOM led the design team for Intuit Dome, which boasts incredible sightlines and the most legroom in the NBA at all locations in the arena.\n\nNotably, the so-called \u201cWall\u201d \u2013 51 uninterrupted rows of seats behind the visiting team\u2019s bench \u2013 is designed to draw in the most passionate fans and, through their voracious distracting jeers, give the Clippers a home court advantage.\n\nThe high-tech facility features the largest-ever double-sided 4K Halo Board in an arena setting, measuring nearly an acre in length, allowing guests to view statistics and see replays.\n\nThe public plaza at the entrance includes a large media screen, concert stage, community basketball courts and space for people to gather.\n\nUnlike some of the newer venues it has just 46 traditional and 20 Bungalow suites.\n\nThe dome\u2019s Halo Suites accommodate 13-17 guests and provide a traditional suite experience, with luxury furnishings and stadium and lounge seating.\n\nIn contrast, the Bungalow suites seat 10 to 14 people and offer club seat views and private access, with premium food and beverage options available.\n\nThe venue\u2019s Courtside Cabanas provide the best baseline and prime views of the player\u2019s tunnel and allow for up to 11 guests.\n\nAccording to Spencer, Intuit differs from other venues in that it\u2019s designed to keep patrons in their seats.\n\nEach seat has its own individual charging outlet, and the facility has 120 restrooms \u2013 more than any other NBA venue \u2013 helping fans to avoid standing on long lines.\n\nSpencer said it\u2019s a radical idea given that the trend in venues over the last 25 years has been to open up the sightlines so that people in clubs and suites can see the game even when they aren\u2019t in their suites.\n\n\u201cMost venues put as many TVs as possible in the concourses so guests never miss a play,\u201d said Spencer. \u201cIntuit Dome is the opposite. There are no TVs in the stadium clubs and concourses and only one TV in each suite, which is purposely disabled during games and concerts. And the sightlines from the suites are such that you have to be in your seat to see the action. Steve Ballmer is committed to fans being in their seats and cheering on the Clippers.\n\n\u201cSo far, some fans love it, and some fans aren\u2019t as enthusiastic,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I commend Intuit Dome for innovating on the fan experience and it will be fun to see how this contrarian vision of premium seating evolves and whether any other venues adopt some of these design elements.\u201d\n\nThe venue, which has five basketball courts \u2013 more than any other NBA arena \u2013 as well as a practice facility and training center, will host the basketball competitions during the 2028 Summer Olympics.\n\nSoFi Stadium\n\nDeveloped by Los Angeles Rams Owner and Chairman Stan Kroenke, SoFi Stadium in Inglewood is a go-to destination for those seeking high-end fan experiences, with 260 luxury suites and over 13,000 premium seats.\n\nLocated on the former Hollywood Park racetrack, SoFi Stadium \u2013 home to the Los Angeles Chargers and Rams \u2013 is the first indoor-outdoor stadium to be constructed in the country and the largest NFL stadium at 3.1 million square feet.\n\n\u201cWhen Mr. Kroenke decided to bring his team to L.A., he wanted to create a unique building that spoke to both L.A. residents and those from around the world,\u201d said Mike Forrester, vice president of premium sales and service at SoFi Stadium and Hollywood Park. \u201cThe stadium\u2019s 360-degree, double-sided, center-hung Infinity Screen is one of its most creative features. The building is also completely freestanding; its roof does not touch the walls, and if there\u2019s a storm the roof acts like a wind sail.\u201d\n\nThe stadium is known for its signature curved roof canopy and 70,000 square-foot 4K Infinity Screen by Samsung.\n\nThere are eight different suite designs and 12 unique club spaces, including 12 Owners Suites on both the east and west sides of the stadium \u2013 spanning goal line to goal line.\n\n\u201cThe Owners Clubs are the most exclusive,\u201d said Forrester. \u201cThe suites open directly into the highest priced clubs in the building. They are very difficult to gain access to because they are sold out for 20 years.\u201d\n\nThe Wynn Club, which is on the east side, and the West Owners Club, are the most upscale of the club spaces with their plush seating, high-end furnishings and all-inclusive food and beverages.\n\nOther premium spaces include the Michelob Ultra Club and Corona Beach House, which are on levels three, four and five on the southeast and southwest sides of the building respectively.\n\nThe levels are connected by spiral staircases, feature a lounge on level three and can accommodate up to 200 guests between levels four and five. These spaces offer excellent sightlines, LED TVs throughout and a buffet featuring a rotating menu of premium offerings.\n\nLocated on level two just behind the first 19 rows of seats, the Google Cloud Club spans all 360 degrees of the building. The club is accessible to patrons on the 100 Level and holds between 8,000 and 9,000 people.\n\nOne of the most intriguing specialty spaces is the 2,000-square-foot field-level Bootsy Bellows. Developed in partnership with global hospitality firm The h.wood Group and co-owned by John Terzian and Brian Toll, it includes a private speakeasy and DJ booth.\n\nWhile SoFi Stadium has hosted a variety of sports and entertainment events since opening in 2020 \u2013 including the Superbowl LVI in February 2022 and six sold-out Taylor Swift concerts \u2013 its crowning event is yet to come.\n\nIn 2028, it will serve as one of the sites for the Summer Olympics hosted in L.A. The opening and closing ceremonies will take at the stadium and the football field will be transformed into an Olympic-sized pool for the swimming competitions.",

The Lakers had two home games pushed back, one against the Hornets on Thursday and the other being the first in a planned two-game series against the Spurs on Saturday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"When people are losing their homes, kids are losing schools, losing lives, it\u2019s very difficult to approach the game of basketball because life is bigger than basketball,\" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. \"Hopefully we can bring some kind of joy with the game coming back tomorrow and some togetherness and try to put some smiles on people\u2019s faces in tough times.\"\n\nInstead of spending the day before a game resting, the Clippers\u2019 Terance Mann planned to leave practice and scour a storage unit he keeps for useful items.\n\n\"I just want to give a lot of clothes, some money, shoes, whatever I can,\" he said. \"I\u2019m going to go help people out and donate and drive around and do what I can do to help.\"\n\nThe Lakers announced plans for a donation drive for their upcoming games, starting Monday, asking fans to bring new, in-the-package items to support the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank\u2019s relief efforts.\n\nThe Lakers' UCLA Health Training Center in El Segundo will begin serving as a drive-thru donation center on Tuesday, the team said. The Lakers said non-food items such as deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrushes, lotion, waterless shampoo, battery-pack phone chargers, socks, mittens and gloves, hand warmers, beanies and blankets are priorities.\n\nFor food items, the Lakers said donations of peanut and other nut butters, protein-based snacks, crackers, peanut butter crackers, trail mix, fruit snacks, energy bars, pop top tuna, pop top chicken, 100% juice boxes, raisins and other dried fruit, UHT milk, individual cereal boxes, water and non-carbonated drinks are welcomed.\n\nThe Spurs had to change hotels because of fire concerns after arriving in Los Angeles, and the Heat arrived on Saturday night as scheduled after playing in Portland.\n\n\"Obviously, we just want to see the community come back together,\" Spurs forward Harrison Barnes said.\n\nChecking apps and watching and listening to 24/7 news about the fires has become a habit since the disaster began Tuesday, with multiple fires burning around Los Angeles County.\n\n\"I\u2019ve watched the news more than I ever have in my life over the past three days,\" Mann said, smiling. \"I was just on YouTube TV watching the news in the locker room trying to get an update on what\u2019s going on.\"\n\nThe Clippers were on the road when the fires began. Kawhi Leonard left the team in Denver to return to his family and home in Pacific Palisades, one of the two biggest fires in the area.\n\n\"It was good to see that him and his family are doing good,\" Mann said.\n\nSome members of the Clippers organization had to evacuate their homes and others know people who lost theirs. Lakers coach JJ Redick said last week that the house he and his family are renting this season \u2014 along with most of their possessions \u2014 was completely destroyed by fire.\n\n\"People are still barely getting sleep,\" Mann said. \"Some guys lost power, some guys got family stuff to figure out, some peoples\u2019 kids school burned down. There\u2019s a lot going on. It\u2019s way bigger than basketball.\"\n\nIn Denver, Nicolas Batum said he checked his phone at halftime \u2014 something he never does \u2014 to see where the fires were burning. He got back to LA and rushed to pack boxes when he thought his family would have to flee.\n\nNow, the Clippers are eager to return to their jobs and give their fans a break.\n\n\"We\u2019ve been through the crazy stuff for the last five days,\" Batum said. \"I think maybe people need that to get their mind off of it for two, three hours.\"\n\nThe Clippers and Lakers both have home games scheduled for Wednesday as well, with the Clippers taking on Brooklyn and the Lakers playing host to the Heat. ESPN was planning to broadcast the Lakers-Heat game; the network changed those plans on Sunday and put a game with Golden State visiting Minnesota on the national TV schedule in its place.\n\nReporting by The Associated Press.\n\nFOLLOW Follow your favorites to personalize your FOX Sports experience National Basketball Association Los Angeles Lakers LA Clippers\n\nshare",

In the co-main event, Merab Dvalishvili defends his bantamweight belt for the first time against the unbeaten Umar Nurmagomedov.\n\nHowever, with deadly wildfires continuing to engulf parts of California, the event may have to be moved. They are planning to host the show at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood; where there have already been events moved amid safety concerns.\n\nDana White speaks on potentially moving UFC 311 to Las Vegas\n\nAfter Monday night\u2019s NFL game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Minnesota Vikings was moved from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, attention began to turn to UFC 311. Taking place just over a mile down the road at the new Intuit Dome, there are concerns for the event\u2019s safety.\n\nPhoto by Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC\n\nIt had been reported by Uncrowned\u2019s Ariel Helwani that should the event be forced to move, Las Vegas was a frontrunner host city. It is the home of the UFC, and there even appears to be a free booking at the famed T-Mobile Arena.\n\nAnd speaking with Kick Streamer Adin Ross on a recent broadcast, Dana White confirmed those reports. he told the controversial social media star: \u201cWell if the fire gets bad we\u2019re coming to Vegas\u2026 We\u2019ll move it to Vegas if it gets too bad but as of now it\u2019s all a go. NBA is going to go this week, we\u2019re going to go.\u201d\n\nCalifornia State Athletic Commission boss makes statement on UFC 311\n\nOn Friday night, Helwani began to report about the prospect of the event being moved. UFC owner Ari Emmanuel has since lost his Los Angeles home to the fires, and it remains to be seen what will happen with the card.\n\nAs part of Friday\u2019s episode of The Craic on Helwani\u2019s Uncrowned network, host Petesy Carroll was sent a statement from California State Athletic Commission boss Andy Foster. \u201cWe are watching the ongoing wildfires and the subsequent emergency and disastrous response in the Los Angeles area,\u201d Carroll read.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are with the residents of that region and we appreciate the efforts of First Responders in keeping the community safe.\n\n\u201cAt this time, no decisions have been made about moving UFC 311 but we will continue to work with state and local officials and the UFC to determine the best course of action, thank you.\u201d",

The Palisades Fire has been particularly devastating, resulting in the destruction of over 5,600 structures across 24,000 acres. Tragically, at least 16 people have lost their lives due to the fires.\n\nWhile it is far from the most important question facing the city, it begs the question if the NBA would consider moving the game to another arena, as the NFL did in the case of the Los Angeles Rams Wild Card playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings that was moved to the Arizona Cardinals stadium in Glendale, Arizona rather than at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.\n\nLos Angeles native and former Clipper Chris Paul cast a worried shadow over the Spurs\u2019 Wednesday night loss in Milwaukee. With his wife and children evacuated from their home since Tuesday due to the wildfires, Paul expressed deep concern for the community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrifying situation,\u201d Paul said, his voice heavy with emotion. \u201cSending all my love and prayers to loved ones who\u2019ve lost everything.\u201d\n\nThe Spurs\u2019 arrival in Los Angeles mirrored the city\u2019s anxious mood. Landing shortly after the game, they initially checked into a Santa Monica hotel. However, precautionary measures necessitated a late-night relocation to a downtown Los Angeles hotel.\n\nKawhi Leonard took a short leave of absence to tend to his family amid the wildfires.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s postponement of Thursday\u2019s Lakers-Hornets game at Crypto.com Arena remains in effect, with a rescheduled date yet to be determined. Lakers coach JJ Redick, another victim of the fires, revealed last week that his Palisades home had been destroyed.\n\nLooking ahead, the Lakers face a Wednesday matchup against the Heat at home, while the Clippers host the Brooklyn Nets after Monday\u2019s games.",

This highly anticipated PPV card sets the tone for the year, featuring a thrilling lineup of fights. The main event is slated to feature lightweight champion Islam Makhachev defending his 155lbs crown in a rematch against top contender Arman Tsarukyan.\n\nIn the co-main event, bantamweight king Merab Dvalishvili faces undefeated Umar Nurmagomedov in a clash of elite grapplers. However, Los Angeles is currently facing a massive wildfire situation which has caused a lot of concerns for the fans. Will the event take place at the same venue in a week? Let us find out below!\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nIs UFC 311 still slated to go down in California?\n\nThe state of California is currently facing a severe wildfire crisis, with multiple blazes consuming vast areas and causing significant destruction. Tragically, the wildfires have resulted in at least 11 fatalities, with the death toll potentially rising as search and rescue operations continue. Approximately 150,000 residents are under mandatory evacuation orders, with an additional 166,000 on standby, highlighting the extensive human impact of these fires. The catastrophe has also led to widespread power outages, affecting nearly 1.6 million homes, and has caused losses predicted to surpass $20 billion.\n\nAs Los Angeles continues to battle the devastation, the safety of residents and visitors remains the top priority. As a result, Rod Wave\u2019s concert at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood scheduled for January 8, 2025, was canceled due to the disaster. However, the venue has made it clear with an official update that the upcoming UFC 311 event will be taking place as previously slated.\n\nMMA media outlet Full Violence took to their Instagram page to share the news with the fans. The caption read, \u201cLA is still on for UFC 311. Press release: \u201cWe will welcome UFC 311 on Saturday, January 18.\u201d\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Full Violence \u2122 (@fullviolence)\n\nIn Los Angeles, five specific areas are currently bearing the brunt of the crisis, with evacuation efforts underway at full capacity to ensure the safety of those in harm\u2019s way. The UFC may need to keep a close eye on two major wildfire hotspots: the Sunset Fire near Runyon Canyon Park and the Palisades Fire near Skull Rock.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nBoth locations are approximately 25 to 35 kilometers from the UFC 311 venue in Inglewood, posing potential concerns for the event. So what happens if there are last-minute cancellations? Well according to MMA journalist extraordinaire Ariel Helwani, Dana White might just have a plan ready.\n\nAriel Helwani reveals Dana White\u2019s Plan B amidst wildfire chaos in LA\n\nAs California continues to grapple with devastating wildfires, renowned MMA journalist Ariel Helwani has reported that the UFC might consider relocating the event. One possible option is moving it to the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on the same date. In a tweet, Helwani shared that the UFC is optimistic the situation will stabilize by next week. However, they are closely watching developments and will decide soon whether to relocate the event. For now, Helwani believes the event will proceed as planned at the Intuit Dome in California.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nHe tweeted, \u201cUFC has had talks about the status of UFC 311 next weekend, I\u2019m told. UFC 311 is currently slated for the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, Calif. Obviously, that region is facing a devastating wildfire crisis at the moment\u2026As of right now, 311 is staying at Intuit. The hope is it remains there. But they are monitoring and ready to move the card if need be. No talks of delaying the card. Obviously, that call needs to happen soon. The event is eight days away. Vegas would be the frontrunner. Worth noting: T-Mobile Arena is not booked for next Saturday, Jan. 18.\u201d\n\nAs Helwani noted, time is running out with January 18 fast approaching. If the UFC decides to relocate the event, particularly to another state, they will need to act quickly. Organizing the logistics for such a move would take at least a few days, and they would also need to address concerns from fans who have already purchased tickets for the live event. Where will UFC 311 finally take place? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.",

(NASDAQ:INTU) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Intuit\n\nCrunching The Numbers\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.81b US$6.66b US$7.81b US$9.07b US$10.8b US$12.0b US$13.1b US$14.0b US$14.8b US$15.5b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x11 Analyst x12 Analyst x6 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 11.71% Est @ 8.98% Est @ 7.07% Est @ 5.74% Est @ 4.80% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$5.4k US$5.8k US$6.4k US$6.9k US$7.7k US$8.0k US$8.1k US$8.1k US$8.0k US$7.9k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$72b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

(Photo by Dean Musgrove/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images)\n\nFred Rogers once said, \u201cWhen I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, \u2018Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.\u2019\u201d In response to the ongoing devastating wildfires in the Los Angeles area, nonprofit organizations and everyday people alike are stepping up to help those in need \u2013 including those who work in the music industry. Plus, initial details have been announced for FIREAID, a benefit concert to be held at Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California.\n\nThe fires that began on Tuesday have destroyed more than 10,000 homes and killed at least 10 people. NPR reported Jan. 10 \u201cwhile there\u2019s been considerable progress in containing the Hurst and Lidia fires, the two largest infernos \u2014 the Palisades and Eaton fires \u2014 persist with little to no signs of waning, according to city officials.\u201d Citing the LA County Sheriff\u2019s Department, NPR noted that \u201cat least 180,000 people have had to evacuate and another 200,000 people are under evacuation warnings as of Thursday.\u201d\n\nAngelenos have already stepped up with acts of altruism and philanthropy from fighting the fires as part of private brigades to donating to food banks to providing shelter for those in need. The music business, too, much of which is based in Los Angeles, is also doing their part.\n\n\n\nToday, the Intuit Dome today announced it will host the FIREAID benefit concert, which is described as \u201can evening of music and solidarity,\u201d on Thursday, Jan. 30. The announcement promises that performers and ticket information will be revealed in the coming days. The concert, which is \u201cdedicated to rebuilding communities devastated by wildfires and supporting efforts to prevent future fire disasters throughout Southern California,\u201d is produced by Shelli, Irving and the Azoff family, in conjunction with Live Nation and AEG Presents.\n\nThe Recording Academy and nonprofit MusiCares announced Friday that the organizations have pledged $1 million to support music professionals impacted by the wildfires with the launch of the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort. Today\u2019s announcement explains that the effort will provide immediate relief as well as long-term support to those in the music industry facing displacement and loss because of the disaster.\n\n\u201cThe entire GRAMMY family is shocked and deeply saddened by the situation unfolding in Los Angeles,\u201d Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of the Recording Academy and MusiCares, said in a statement. \u201cThe music community is being so severely impacted, but we will come together as an industry to support one another. Our organizations exist to serve music people because music is a powerful force for good in the world, and we hope the broader industry will now rally to this cause.\u201d\n\nLaura Segura, Executive Director of MusiCares, added, \u201cWe expect the disaster relief efforts in Los Angeles to be extraordinary, if even just on the basis of how many music people have lost their homes in the last day. MusiCares is always committed to ensuring that music professionals are supported in times of crisis, and we ask for the larger community to donate for those in need at this dire time. MusiCares can help with short term emergent needs for those currently displaced, and then longer-term services as we get a handle on the full extent of how music people are impacted.\u201d\n\nMusiCares, which was founded by the Recording Academy in 1989, provides crisis relief, preventive care, recovery resources, and need-based financial assistance for people across all music professions. For help, visit https://www.musicares.org/get-help.\n\nThe nonprofit Entertainment Community Fund \u2013 which provides a safety net for performing arts and entertainment professionals \u2013 is taking applications for emergency financial assistance. A post on Facebook from the Fund says, \u201cOur hearts are with everyone in Southern California during this unimaginable time. If you\u2019re a part of the entertainment industry and have been impacted by the California Fires, the Fund is here to help through support, connection to resources and emergency financial assistance. Call us at 323.933.9244 or visit entertainmentcommunity.org/CAFires for more information.\u201d\n\nBackline \u2013 a non-profit that connects music industry professionals and their families with mental health and wellness resources \u2013 is encouraging those affected by the fires to reach out to the organization via its case submission form \u201cand a case manager will contact you to help you get the long term support you need. \u201c A post on Facebook says \u201cOur hearts are with the Los Angeles community and all those affected by the devastating wildfires. \ud83d\udc99 Know that Backline is here for you and that you are not alone. \u2026 If you need immediate assistance, please reach out to the Disaster Distress Hotline for free 24/7 support by calling 1-800-985-5990.\u201d Visit https://backline.care/ for more information.\n\nSweet Relief Musicians Fund \u2013 which was founded to provide financial assistance to \u201ccareer musicians and music industry workers who are struggling to make ends meet while facing physical or mental health issues, disability, or age-related problems\u201d \u2013 also announced fire relief for those residing in Los Angeles county and the surrounding areas. The organization is currently accepting donations and applications for assistance.\n\nA post on Sweet Relief\u2019s website notes that the organization \u201cis here to provide immediate financial assistance to music industry professionals impacted by natural disasters. Applications will be taken during a short stretch of time surrounding the disaster, but donations are always welcome.\u201d\n\nThe nonprofit also shared a frequently updated resource list by MALAN (Mutual Aid LA Network) that includes information about assistance including free prepared meals by World Central Kitchen, animal boarding, shelter, free meals and other sources. That Google Doc is available here: CLICK HERE for a frequently updated resource list by MALAN (Mutual Aid LA Network)\n\nAnother Google Doc has been created to help support the music community with a list of resources and a collection of GoFundMe pages to donate to those in the industry in need including artists, agents, tour managers, record executives, publicists and others.

Pacific Palisades has been almost completely wiped out and now the fires have spread to Hollywood Hills.\n\nThat\u2019s just 10 miles north of Intuit Dome.

They\u2019ll be the final arbiters of what is useful, practical, and helpful, and what is merely hype.\n\nIn this blog, we bring you perspectives from several Intuit tech leaders. They delve into the evolution of AI, highlighting how customer control, trust, and practicality will shape the future of technology. From agentic AI that balances autonomy with user authority to the convergence of payments, fintech, and AI, these insights offer a glimpse into the technologies that will define our digital world in 2025 and beyond.\n\nAgentic AI in 2025: striking a balance between autonomous efficiency and customer control\n\nIn 2025, companies at the forefront of the agentic AI revolution will face a critical challenge: balancing the delivery of seamless, done-for-you experiences with the need to give customers ultimate authority and control over final decision-making, at their discretion.\n\nTo achieve this, innovation must focus on AI systems that seamlessly blend advanced autonomy with user-centric control, incorporating adaptive transparency, ethical safeguards, and context-aware learning to empower customer decision-making. These systems must foster trust through robust security and intuitive human-AI collaboration, ensuring efficiency while preserving user authority.\n\nSuch agentic AI systems will not only be capable of autonomously planning, reasoning, and executing tasks to streamline processes and enhance efficiencies, but will instill customer trust and confidence. Striking this delicate balance will be crucial for the long-term success of AI-driven businesses in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.\n\n\u2013Ashok Srivastava, Chief Data Officer\n\nAI governance takes center stage as AI innovation surges\n\nIn 2025, the rapid advancement of AI technology, including agentic AI, necessitates a continued focus on AI governance. Collaboration between ethicists, policymakers, information security, legal professionals and technologists is crucial to navigate the complexities of AI development and deployment. Establishing industry-wide safety frameworks is essential for responsible AI to benefit humanity.\n\n\u2013Ashok Srivastava, Chief Data Officer\n\nAI will pave the way for code-free as the new normal\n\nIn 2025, the rapid surge of AI and agentic models will democratize tech like never before (turning even the most tech-phobic lawyers into AI-powered pros). AI agents will help humans seamlessly \u201cconnect the dots,\u201d delivering personalized services, and turbocharging tasks that once took forever. We\u2019re already seeing workers at varying AI skill levels break free from mundane, repetitive tasks to focus on higher-value strategic initiatives, boosting productivity across a myriad of disciplines (e.g., marketing campaign creation, contract reviews, even regulatory compliance). To stay ahead, businesses must invest in AI training and integration now, ensuring their teams are ready to responsibly harness these powerful tools and drive innovation.\n\n\u2013Elise Houlik, Chief Privacy Officer\n\nThe convergence of payments, fintech, and AI\n\nIn 2025, the fintech landscape will be shaped by four key trends that will collectively transform the way individuals and businesses interact with financial services, paving the way for a more inclusive and accessible financial ecosystem. First, a shift towards banking payments and a preference for instant payments will drive the demand for faster and more efficient money movement. Second, robust digital ID frameworks, potentially government-backed, will be essential for securing transactions and building trust in the digital economy. Third, embedded fintech solutions will continue to proliferate, offering seamless financial services within non-financial platforms. Finally, the rise of AI agents and agentic workflows will necessitate the development of payment infrastructures that can support AI-initiated transactions, further blurring the lines between technology and finance.\n\n\u2013James Barrese, Senior Vice President, FinTech\n\nDeepfakes and the erosion of trust\n\nIn 2025, the proliferation of increasingly sophisticated deepfake technology will begin to pose a significant threat to trust in digital content and online interactions. The ability to convincingly manipulate audio and video will make it difficult to distinguish between authentic and fabricated media, leading to misinformation and disinformation. As deepfakes become more accessible and harder to detect, individuals and organizations will need to develop new strategies for verifying information and ensuring authenticity in the digital age, including educating and promoting awareness for the workforce.\n\n\u2013Atticus Tysen, CISO and CIO\n\nIn 2025, join us as we prepare for a future where AI technology serves the needs of consumers, and small and mid-market businesses, via done-for-you experiences that combine the best of human expertise with AI and data capabilities to responsibly deliver on Intuit\u2019s promise to put more money in our customers\u2019 pockets with less work and complete confidence.",

Tankersley, CPA.CITP, CGMA 00:00\n\nWelcome to the accounting Technology Lab, sponsored by CPA practice advisor, with your host, Randy Johnston and Brian Tankersley,\n\nRandy Johnston 00:11\n\nwelcome to the accounting Technology Lab. I\u2019m Randy Johnston with my co host Brian Tankersley, ish. You may know Brian might have reviewed more accounting software products than any other CPA in the country, and we\u2019ve got another new accounting software product to discuss with you today, the new Intuit enterprise suite. Now I have taken my CPA training on the platform, and there\u2019s a couple of very important capabilities in the platform, including 20 dimensions for reporting and being able to run consolidations. But this is not cheap software. It really is intended to be mid market. So Brian, I know you\u2019ve been around the QuickBooks platforms, both legacy desktop, in all the various versions, and QuickBooks Online and all the various versions, and taught a lot of those courses. But what, what do you think our listeners need to know about the Intuit enterprise suite?\n\nBrian F. Tankersley, CPA.CITP, CGMA 01:11\n\nI think it, I think it is an upgrade from the perspective of, you know, from the perspective of it does include 20 dimensions. It does include multi company and intercompany capabilities and quite a few, quite a few things like that. I also think that you know when we\u2019re when we\u2019re looking at this, I want you to be very careful with the word enterprise in here. Okay, because when you and I and most accountants talk about enterprise. We\u2019re talking about fortune 500 SAP, Oracle e business suite and and again, the the top end stuff that\u2019s highly customized for the workflows. Okay? What we\u2019re talking about here is a low end, mid market product that is also integrated with platforms to allow sell through of payroll, benefits, insurance, 401, k as well as, as well as some additional, some additional data integration with MailChimp and so, you know, I guess the the thing I would just kind of generally say here Is that I think there is a need for this product. I think the the big, the big open thing to figure out is is going to be how this is going to be received by the partners when they get it to sell, and and how this is going to replace QuickBooks Enterprise. Because I think that\u2019s the 800 pound, you know, I think that\u2019s the, the 800 pound gorilla in the room, that that everybody needs to talk about is that, is that, again, this, this is, appears to be what they\u2019re picking out to replace QuickBooks Enterprise on a going forward basis. Yeah.\n\nRandy Johnston 02:55\n\nSo, you know, that is background there. You know, the industries that were presented as being, you know, capable in this product they call industry specific needs. And I think they can do some of this pretty well, construction being a good example. But also the product is pictured to be light manufacturing, and based on my understanding of the platform to date, not so much on that. So, you know, I know Intuit folks might disagree with me on that, but, you know, I don\u2019t think so. Now,\n\nBrian F. Tankersley, CPA.CITP, CGMA 03:25\n\nall I can, I can\u2019t name a single kind of manufacturing that\u2019s going to go well in in QBO advanced at this point, simply because, you know, you look at the assemblies, you look at all those things that and it\u2019s, you know, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I can\u2019t imagine make to order, Make to Stock, custom order. You know, customized, customization. I mean, you know, process manufacturing a lot, you know, maybe it does lot in serial tracking. But it\u2019s, again, it\u2019s, it\u2019s a matter of trying to figure out what those workflows look like in here. Yeah, and\n\nRandy Johnston 03:59\n\nyour caution on into an enterprise in the name is another pretty important one, because, again, you\u2019re used to talking with me and my biases tier 1234, and five, and I\u2019ve always put QuickBooks down at tier five and sap up at tier one, and competitor like sage Intacct at tier three, and maybe, maybe NetSuite up at tier two, but, you know, not much more capable than sage in tech, and I think into it. Is it targeting the sage intaccts And the net suites of the world, and they\u2019ve got a long way to go. This product, in my opinion, is at best tier four right now, 444, and a half, yeah, yeah, yeah, somewhere in that range. So, anyway, but, but let\u2019s,\n\nBrian F. Tankersley, CPA.CITP, CGMA 04:41\n\nlet\u2019s say in fairness here, okay, in fairness, those other products are $200 per user per month, every month, okay? And they have a minimum of five or 10 users. And so I want to, I want to be fair, to into it that they have a less complete product, but they also. Have a they also have a significantly lower price, yeah,\n\nRandy Johnston 05:04\n\nand, you know, knowing that that\u2019s this positioning, and we have done other technology labs on a lot of these other products, and we will be, you know, attending the Acumatica conference and many others in the near term, and we\u2019ll produce new content on all of these mid market products. But just to give a pricing perspective, that\u2019s a little different. Microsoft 365 Business Central is $70 per user per month. Okay, so if you\u2019ve got 10 users, you know $700 times 12 is 8400 and most of the Intuit enterprise right now is being sold in a cooperative sale with Intuit involved. And the numbers that we understand, and again, don\u2019t quote these. You always have to get your pricing from the vendors, but we wanted to give you perspective, is about $7,500 for the base system, $5,000 for each additional company. And Intuit expects the average business to spend 22 five on the platform. Okay? So again, that doesn\u2019t sound over the top in terms of a, you know, a mid market type of sale, and when you consider the current pricing of QuickBooks, desktop, enterprise, per user. For our purposes, I\u2019m going to call it a couple of 1000 user. You know, times 10 is 20,000 Okay, 20,000 versus 22,000 okay, we\u2019re kind of in the same ballpark. But QuickBooks, enterprise, desktop and Intuit enterprise, are less capable than Microsoft. 365 Business Central, or sage Intacct or NetSuite. So, you know, again, we\u2019re just trying to help you understand what\u2019s going on here. Now, the good news is it\u2019s somewhat familiar feeling, because it\u2019s kind of like QuickBooks Online in terms of its look and feel, and, you know, the reporting tools and the payment integrations and a lot of the other technologies that Intuit has developed over time, they\u2019re integrated as well. So it gives you a chance, if you\u2019re currently a QBO shop, to keep people on something that looks like QBO, or possibly convert people from enterprise. So, you know, there\u2019s some modules and so forth that are included in here, or capabilities. Brian, what are maybe three or four, maybe five of the other functions that are out there?\n\nBrian F. Tankersley, CPA.CITP, CGMA 07:32\n\nSure, well, it\u2019s, of course, it\u2019s using the Intuit payments and Bill Pay in there. So they, they again, want to, want to be involved in the transaction and the funding and everything. They\u2019ve got some stuff on project profitability, some financial management, including financial planning and analysis capabilities, payroll and HR, as well as marketing. But again, they\u2019re also, they\u2019re also putting in the middle of this health insurance through Allstate. They\u2019re putting in their workers comp. They\u2019re putting in there some retirement plans. So it\u2019s clear that they are intending to have integrated solutions that also help them monetize the suite with referral fees.\n\nRandy Johnston 08:15\n\nYeah, yeah, that whole financial services play we\u2019ve talked about for some time, and we also have been concerned not knowing a firm timing for the discontinuance of the desktop versions. One little fact that\u2019s kind of interesting to know is the guarantee to write works that they would allow hosting of enterprise through 2027 so we know we\u2019re in a window here where QuickBooks Desktop enterprise will exist for a while, but of course, we\u2019re already past the new sales of the legacy QuickBooks Desktop products. So it\u2019s clear we\u2019re in a transition period.\n\nBrian F. Tankersley, CPA.CITP, CGMA 08:51\n\nYeah, that\u2019s, right, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, you know, and again, it is, it is an interesting time. Here\u2019s another slide from their deck on this, you know. Again, they\u2019re they\u2019re incorporating some bi functions. They also are including their Gen OS, their proprietary AI based tool. They\u2019re saying that this is going to be the the tool that actually will do a good job on on multi company consolidated reports. They\u2019ve got features in here. I actually saw that they have some intercompany capabilities in regular desktop enterprise, but it looks like they\u2019re going to have some intercompany capabilities in here too. One thing that is a big deal that they\u2019ve added is this multi dimensional piece where, you know, again, we\u2019ve had classes and locations in the past that most of you are familiar with, but you can have up to 18 more of these fields that you use to classify things. And again, I would just caution everybody to be careful that you don\u2019t go too crazy setting these things up, because what happens is you end up tagging every transaction with the. Mentioned that\u2019s associated with it. So you want to have enough, but not too many, okay? And 2020, is going to be too many for most people. And and again, because it\u2019s shiny, some people may be, may tend toward putting a whole bunch in. So we just want to be careful with that. They also have, they also have some revenue recognition tools, some, again, intercompany transaction tool, some financial planning analysis, some workflow automation, as well as some industry solutions to address areas around services and contract and general contracting, so job costing, change orders, project profitability features in there as well. Then notice that they also have in here a bunch of marketing capabilities that, again, are driven by MailChimp and some CRM tools. They have financial services associated with this, including the QuickBooks business network and QB money, which I think is, is, again, a big part of, big part of this as well. If we look at getting capital, notice that they list term loans lines of credits, as well as the QuickBooks capital marketplace, where, again, they\u2019re, they\u2019re trying to be involved in, in more and more of the of the financing.\n\nRandy Johnston 11:17\n\nAnd those are web bank and QuickBooks capital backed on those services. So, you know, there\u2019s plays on that.\n\nBrian F. Tankersley, CPA.CITP, CGMA 11:25\n\nAnd then you\u2019ve got the workforce management, where, again, they\u2019re integrating with hrs. Is, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve got an HRIS, but they\u2019re again, providing payroll through QuickBooks. And then you have the QuickBooks live features in here, which is the, again, the one of the things again, that is, that is difficult for some. Some accounting professionals really struggle with and consider to be a competitive offering. You know, they have live setup, live bookkeeping and live business tax in here, as well as MailChimp live. So, you know, again, this is it\u2019s a there again, with MailChimp lives, they\u2019re really increasing their the scope of their offerings to to these folks,\n\nRandy Johnston 12:14\n\nyeah, so, you know, we\u2019ve talked about some of the privacy issues and so forth with MailChimp and some of the other platforms on Intuit, but I do appreciate the positioning on the platform and some of the scope. Now, again, this is relatively new as the year unfolds, more will come out. Brian and I will continue to learn more about this and talk about it more as it becomes better known. But you know, at least at this point, we wanted to make sure that you had some background and exposure. Now, the base package for Intuit enterprise has financials in it, so you can buy one company or multiple companies. You get some discounts for additional companies. We\u2019ve already talked about the dimensions, and then there\u2019s the users are broken up in multiple tiers. There\u2019s standard users and free users and super users that are there. The free users are basically view only access for reports and invoices. So it, you know, pushes that out a little bit more. The bill pay is in their family, so they\u2019re trying to pull that inside. And they also have preferred payment rates. One of the things that they thought they\u2019d have to do with this enterprise system is have dedicated support reps, so they not only have customer success managers, but also mid market product experts that are, you know, included with the subscriptions when you do the premium professional services. So just be aware that you know that you\u2019re going to have those things available now there\u2019s other solutions for additional cost, including the ability to run payroll and timekeeping and being able to get MailChimp premium, and to be able to do implementation and integration services and get customized training and reporting, every indication is the implementations are all going to be remote, but that\u2019s yet to be seen, because on more complex businesses, sometimes That doesn\u2019t work very well. And of course, I\u2019ve actually already called out that if you\u2019re throwing additional entities, you\u2019ll have extra dollars related to that. But there\u2019s also an additional dimension pricing as well. Further standard user super users have additional uplift costs too. Now Intuit has not provided price sheets to us at this point in time, nor have they provided their terms of service EULA and Privacy Policy, which I have requested. So again, there\u2019s going to be things that are being learned, but let\u2019s face it, this thing\u2019s only been out a couple of months in the initial rollout. Ups, and, you know, the information is still somewhat limited. Now, the people that I\u2019ve talked to that are in the council have been involved with for a while. They\u2019ve got more insights, but there\u2019s quite a bit of information that\u2019s still not very public, and that\u2019s a little confusing to me, but I think I see where they\u2019re going with it. But, you know, we\u2019ll have to see. So, you know, we talked earlier about the ideal fit clients, Brian and you know, what is the current Intuit positioning on that?\n\nBrian F. Tankersley, CPA.CITP, CGMA 15:33\n\nWell, they, they see, realistically, you know, three basic profiles in here. One is going to be entity organizations that operate multiple US based entities generate more than 3 million in revenue and have multi entities, and again, have have multiple entities involved. Another one would be single entity users that require multi dimensional reporting, and then the industries, industry specializations that they\u2019re focused on, again, are going to be construction, nonprofit, profit, service and project based and professional service businesses. So again, they\u2019re trying to leverage those that that Job Costing or the again, the job reporting feature that they have into the industries where that plays well,\n\nRandy Johnston 16:22\n\nyeah. So that said, those are the primaries for the platform. So, you know, we\u2019ve already mentioned a few of what we call the key features, but Brian, I think you\u2019ve got a a few opinions on on those items, and we\u2019ve mentioned them a bit, but we want to summarize them here.\n\nBrian F. Tankersley, CPA.CITP, CGMA 16:42\n\nYeah, so, so again, multi entity, dimensions, up to 20. Again, be careful with with these when you\u2019re assigning them, do kind of a gut check. You know, three or four dimensions is a good number. 20 is too many, okay, so, so figuring out how you can make that work is important for industry customization, again, I I haven\u2019t seen enough yet to make me comfortable with this in a manufacturing environment. Maybe you could make it work with wholesale distribution or something like that. You know, the dimensions certainly will help there. Project Management, financials is interesting. FPA, you know, going beyond budgets and cash flow, cash flow reporting, I think is going to be an interesting piece that we\u2019ll have to see how that, how that also flushes out, that\u2019s, that\u2019s, again, another place where they\u2019re adding capability, potentially. And again, I haven\u2019t spent as much time on this product as as others have. Again, it seems like we\u2019re almost in in in a live preview for this product right now.\n\nRandy Johnston 17:48\n\nYou know, that\u2019s kind of an interesting way to talk about it, Brian. Because, you know, I push Brian to say, look, I\u2019d really like to at least have something out for our listeners, for Intuit enterprise, because I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll hear about it, and we wanted to let you know what we thought was key things to know at this point.\n\nBrian F. Tankersley, CPA.CITP, CGMA 18:09\n\nFor example, I\u2019m not aware that they have, that they have a partner program for this yet that is active, you know, actively selling it the same way the Intuit solution providers are selling the the QuickBooks Enterprise product, the desktop product, yeah, and\n\nRandy Johnston 18:26\n\nright now, the preferred sales methodology is, you know, partner works with Intuit directly to close the deal. And I think that\u2019s partially to get the scoping and expectation set correctly, and I think it\u2019s also to continue to work on the pricing model, but again, that\u2019s my observation. So we prefer to be very fact based here in the technology lab, and facts are few and far between on the platform.\n\nBrian F. Tankersley, CPA.CITP, CGMA 18:57\n\nThat\u2019s fair. That\u2019s fair, all right. Well, I guess, you know, I\u2019m, I\u2019m waiting with bated breath to see where we go with this and where what happens with it. I think it\u2019s a needed product. I\u2019m, you know, again, I\u2019m, I think it\u2019s going to be interesting to see how this is accepted by the marketplace as time goes on. Yeah.\n\nRandy Johnston 19:19\n\nWell, I appreciate those closing thoughts there, Brian, because again, I wanted at least enough of our listeners to be aware of it. Intuit is routinely promoting CPA courses. It\u2019s the orientation. They\u2019ve got a few other courses, and I have intentionally attended them just to hear what the messaging was from Intuit and the product manager behind them, but we\u2019ll see what happens over time. And you know there\u2019s a lot of a lot of road ahead, so we do appreciate you listening in, and we will talk to you again soon in another technology lab. You have a good day today.\n\nBrian F. Tankersley, CPA.CITP, CGMA 19:59 Thank you for sure. Sharing your time with us. We\u2019ll be back next Saturday with a new episode of the technology lab from CPA practice advisor. Have a great week.\n\n= END =",

INTU is a financial software company that provides solutions for small businesses and personal finance management.\n\nInsider sales can sometimes indicate lack of confidence in a company\u2019s future.

Based on other informative insider transactions from the last three months, corporate insiders have sold $23.4 million worth of INTU stock. Overall, TipRanks\u2019 Insider Trading Activity Tool shows that insider confidence in the stock is currently Very Negative.\n\nInvestors may benefit from keeping an eye on transactions made by key insiders, as these transactions typically reflect their confidence in the company\u2019s prospects.

Canceling his trip to Italy, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, \u201cAfter returning this evening from Los Angeles, where earlier today he had met with police, fire and emergency personnel fighting the historic fires raging in the area and approved a Major Disaster declaration for California, President Biden made the decision to cancel his upcoming trip to Italy to remain focused on directing the full federal response in the days ahead.\u201d\n\nWhile ending his time in the White House, President Biden looked to travel to Italy to speak with officials like Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, and even Pope Francis. He hoped at the time to \u201cdiscuss efforts to advance peace around the world, including Pope Francis\u2019 work to alleviate suffering for vulnerable communities.\u201d\n\nAlthough residents continue to flee the area, President Biden promised the government was ready \u201cTo do anything and everything as long as it takes to contain these fires and help reconstruct, make sure we get to normal.\u201d\n\nBesides Wave\u2019s concert canceled, other events canceled included a Wicked sing-along event, the taping of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and even the matchup between the Los Angeles Kings and the Calgary Flames.\n\n(Photo by Paras Griffin/Getty Images)",

On Thursday night, the Los Angeles Lakers were supposed to face the Charlotte Hornets in an NBA matchup at the downtown Los Angeles arena. However, that too has now been postponed. So, will Dana White also see UFC 311 meeting such a fate?\n\nWell, this is definitely a question that will plague the minds of fans. In fact, a user also took to social media to pose the question regarding the Los Angeles fire affecting the Islam Makhchev headlined UFC 311 event that takes place at the Intuit Dome in California. Well, it all depends on the UFC head honcho. But as of now, no update has come to light on that front.\n\nWhile the Pepperdine women\u2019s basketball team also joined the list by postponing its scheduled Thursday night game against the University of Portland, it is worth noting that all the above postponed and canceled events would have taken place in Los Angeles. However, flights getting canceled in and out of Los Angeles would definitely affect the first PPV of 2025.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nTaking to his Instagram story, Dana White also offered any sort of help that the city and its fire department would need during this delicate situation. \u201cLove this!!! Already called @govjoelombardo Much respect to all the first responders from Nevada and California. ANYTHING you need for Me or @ufc, we got you!\u201d\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by cosmikmma (@cosmikmma)\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nSo, it is possible that he may postpone the event out of solidarity as well. But what do the fans think will happen?\n\nFans show growing concern over Dana White\u2019s UFC 311\n\nAs soon as people started questioning the fate of UFC 311 through social media posts, fans were quick to share their theories about it. Some of these comments shared the belief that the event could face cancellation for now. If the airport shuts down and the catastrophe grows even worse, Dana White might call it quits for now. \u201cIf flights into LAX get cancelled likely in jeopardy.\u201d The people could witness the destruction from the live cameras of the arena, so holding a night of fun out there so soon seems like a bad idea. \u201cSaw the live cam near the Intuit Dome, and you can already see the fire from that distance, and the air is covered with smog.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nHowever, some believed that Dana White might move the location of the event to a different city altogether. While keeping the fights alive, the UFC can find themselves in Las Vegas on the 18th of January. After all, it is the first event of 2025, and the UFC head honcho would want it to come to fruition. Taking to the comments, the fans wrote, \u201cHonestly maybe, but I think Dana would announce it moved to Vegas more than likely. Dana will move to a new place,\u201d and \u201cI think it\u2019s not big problem for uncle Dana; Vegas stays an option.\u201d\n\nSome fans were optimistic enough to believe that there would be no cancellation or change of venue. Hopefully the fire gets under control soon. One fan wrote that there would be no hindrance and the event would go as it was. Giving other fans some hope, they wrote, \u201cShould be fine\u201d and \u201cValid question tbh, but we should be good. I live in southern LA, and we\u2019re okay.\u201d But what do you think? Is UFC 311 in real jeopardy, according to you? Let us know in the comments.",

(Nasdaq: INTU), the global financial technology platform that makes Intuit TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, today announced a suite of offerings designed to help filers access their tax refunds faster and more affordably as TurboTax e-file opens for the 2024 tax season. The offerings include the only do-it-yourself mobile app offer on the market, providing completely free federal and state tax preparation regardless of tax complexity. In addition, TurboTax is providing the first and only fast refund guarantee that delivers federal tax refunds 5 days early no matter the filer\u2019s banking institution, helping consumers get faster access to critical funds.\n\nFor millions of Americans, the tax refund, averaging over $3,000, represents the largest paycheck of the year. Getting fast access to those funds can be indispensable. According to a generational tax survey conducted on behalf of TurboTax by Talker Research, 93% of Gen Z expects to get a refund this year and they plan to use their refund to pay for necessities. In fact, access to faster refunds would mean they are able to avoid debt fees (20%), pay rent on time (35%), and pay off debt (35%).1\n\n\"We are proud to continue advancing our faster refund offerings as well as provide free do-it-yourself filing through our mobile app offer to arm our customers with the financial flexibility and security they deserve,\u201d said Executive Vice President and General Manager of Intuit's Consumer Group, Mark Notarainni. \u201cWe are giving our customers unparalleled access to their hard-earned money at affordable prices, empowering them to pay bills, pay down debt, and manage daily expenses with greater ease and peace of mind.\"\n\nAlthough many companies claim to offer fast refund services, they often do not deliver the funds where consumers need them. Moving money between bank accounts can take up to 5 days. Unlike traditional refund services, TurboTax\u2019s newest 5 Days Early refund offering delivers these vital funds into any U.S. bank account, providing taxpayers expedited access to their money.\n\nTurboTax\u2019s fast money offerings include:\n\nNEW! 5 Days Early Refund Offering 2 - Consumers can get their federal refund delivered 5 days before IRS settlement - guaranteed. 3 For a $25 flat fee, TurboTax delivers the refund into any U.S. bank account in the customer\u2019s name whether they file through TurboTax or Credit Karma.

Through its Free Mobile App Offer everyone new to TurboTax, or those who did not file with TurboTax last year, regardless of their tax complexity, can file their own federal and state taxes for free through the TurboTax mobile app through Feb. 18, 2025. No other tax preparation provider on the market has an offer like this.\n\nIn addition, starting Jan. 15, 2025 assisted filers who hand off their taxes to an expert with TurboTax Live Full Service and file by March 25, 2025 are guaranteed a minimum 10 percent reduction in the fees they paid their tax professional last season with the upcoming Beat Your Price Offer.\n\nThe importance of faster refunds to consumers is clearly demonstrated in TurboTax\u2019s generational tax survey of 4,000 Americans. Results found that for many Gen Z and Millennial filers, early access to funds is critical in helping them avoid late payments and fees. TurboTax also found that a majority of consumers across all generations plan to prioritize spending their refunds on necessities, like food and medication.\n\nTurboTax Generational Tax Survey Highlights:\n\nWhen asked what getting their tax refund a week earlier would allow them to do, those surveyed shared:\n\nThe 93% of Gen Z who expect to receive a refund felt faster funds will help pay off debt (35%), and even pay their rent on time (35%), while all generations expressed earlier refunds would lead to them comfortably affording necessities such as food and medications, and noted being less stressed overall (Gen Z 35%, Millennials 32%, Gen X 27% and Baby Boomers 13%).\n\nWhen asked how they plan to spend their 2025 tax refund, those surveyed shared:\n\nDespite generational differences, the common thread among all generations is the prioritization of financial responsibility with their tax refunds, focusing on essential needs such as housing, food (33%), and savings (43%) over discretionary spending such as travel, vacation (13%), and entertainment (8%).\n\nWe also see more Gen Z noting they will invest their refunds through stocks, bonds, or crypto (19%) over any other generation (Millennials 16%, Gen X 10%, Baby Boomers 6%).\n\nThey also feel they will spend their refund on entertainment, such as concerts and sporting events (14%) over other generations. Only 9% of Millennials, 5% of Gen X, and 1% of Baby Boomers noted they would spend their refund in this way.\n\nTax year 2024 TurboTax products are now available for consumers and small businesses in English and Spanish at www.TurboTax.com, the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

            "content": "Welcome to 2025, where younger generations are prioritizing wellness over wealth\u2014specifically, financial wellness. The focus is no longer solely on accumulating wealth but on achieving financial wellbeing. Gone are the days when big paychecks defined success; today, mental clarity, peace, and control over money matters take precedence. This transformation reflects a broader cultural evolution, advocating for sustainable financial wellness over riches. It underscores a growing recognition that true success extends beyond earning capacity to encompass self-care, fostering relationships with money that nurture happiness and contentment. This shift in popular thought continues to influence, encouraging a holistic view of wealth that aligns with personal values and long-term life satisfaction.\n\nAccording to Intuit\u2019s latest consumer survey, Beyond the Budget: How Younger Generations Are Easing Stress with Financial Wellness Habits, 58% of 18-35-year-olds are integrating financial management into their overall wellness routines. Significantly, 44% report improvements in their quality of life since embracing financial wellness, illustrating that even small adjustments can lead to substantial benefits. Discover how money savvy and budget conscious Gen Z and Millennials are thinking about financial wellness \u2014 and the small steps you can take to join the movement.\n\nThe State of Financial Stress\n\nYou\u2019re not alone if you\u2019re feeling anxious about money. With the cost of living rising, debt mounting, and unexpected expenses impacting many, it\u2019s hardly surprising that financial stress is affecting 61% of 18-35-year-olds. Women and Black and Latino communities are particularly impacted, many of whom report that their financial anxiety has worsened over the past year.\n\nThe primary culprits of this stress? A sharp increase in the cost of living (76%), job instability (48%), and escalating housing expenses (46%) lead the concerns. In a recent conversation with my Gen Z sister and a group of her friends\u2014all recently graduated from college\u2014I inquired about the financial issues that weighed most heavily on them. Among the four women present, the thought of earning a sustainable living and potentially never becoming homeowners was a prevailing source of unease.\n\nReflecting on my own journey as a millennial homeowner, I recall the uncertainty I felt about the feasibility of homeownership. It was only through family support, partnering with someone well-versed in finance, and pooling our resources that I managed to navigate this significant life milestone in my early thirties. This dream can still be a reality for younger generations. Having a clear plan of action, along with researching available tax deductions and credits, can significantly aid your path to homeownership and ensure you are making the most financially sound decisions on your journey.\n\nChallenges in Achieving Financial Wellness\n\nWhile a growing number of people are emphasizing financial wellness, 32% of survey respondents admit they don\u2019t have a clear strategy for managing money setbacks. The most significant challenges include living paycheck to paycheck (49%), handling unexpected expenses (45%), and difficulty saving (29%). Women and communities of color encounter even steeper obstacles, with 38% of women reporting insufficient emergency savings, compared to 25% of men. Despite these hurdles, adopting small, intentional actions such as budgeting, building extra income, or practicing value-driven spending by living below your means has proven effective in overcoming these barriers and creating a more durable financial foundation.\n\nMany individuals are navigating similar financial waters, and connecting with others\u2019 experiences can provide encouragement and a sense of community. Consider the story of Intuit intern Eileen Kang, who turned her passion for jewelry-making into a profitable side hustle to support herself through college.\n\nThe Rise of Generation Side Hustle\n\nAmidst financial stress, people are discovering creative ways to get ahead. One of the most popular strategies? Side hustles. According to Intuit data, over 41% of Gen Z and Millennials find that engaging in side hustles or additional income streams has significantly boosted their financial wellness. These efforts are more than just short-term fixes; in fact, 31% of individuals are targeting side hustles as their #1 financial goal for 2025. Whether it\u2019s freelance work or passion projects, side hustles offer a tangible method to increase income, build savings, and improve financial stability.\n\nIntuit\u2019s recent survey of 18-35-year-olds, \u201cThe Side Hustle Generation: Gen Z and Millennials Redefine Financial Success,\u201d reveals that nearly two-thirds of respondents have initiated or are planning to start a side hustle to complement their primary income. Even more indicative of a lasting trend, 65% of them intend to continue their entrepreneurial endeavors in 2025. These are not just fleeting trends but signify a profound shift in how younger generations view work, purpose, and financial independence.\n\nMoney Talks and Wellness Routines For Financial Self Care\n\nTalking about money has long been seen as taboo, but that\u2019s starting to change. According to our consumer survey, 65% of people want to have more open conversations about money, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Money impacts every aspect of our lives \u2014 from our daily choices to our mental well-being. In fact, 55% of people believe their physical and mental wellness are directly tied to their financial wellness. One way people are breaking the silence? Creating a financial wellness routine.\n\nMore than half (58%) of Americans have made money management a key part of their overall self-care routines, and it\u2019s paying off. 36% of people report feeling less financial anxiety since starting a routine, and 41% say creating a budget and sticking to it has had the biggest impact on improving their relationship with money. While some are still missing out on this aspect of self-care (28% have yet to create a financial wellness routine), the growing push to normalize open money talks is helping people feel more comfortable discussing their finances with friends, family, and even coworkers.\n\nOutlook for 2025: A New Era of Financial Wellness\n\nThe movement toward financial wellness and self-care is rapidly gaining traction, as an increasing number of individuals emphasize structured financial routines, entrepreneurial side hustles, and transparent discussions about money management. This cultural shift is already yielding significant impacts\u201433% of respondents assert that targeted financial wellness strategies have empowered them to advocate more effectively for themselves in the workplace. Furthermore, 44% report that aligning their spending with their personal values has not only simplified financial decisions but also enhanced their overall financial peace of mind. As access to financial education broadens, with free tools like Intuit for Education, anticipate that Gen Z and Millennials will persist in redefining the traditional concepts of wealth, shaping them to fit their values and lifestyle preferences more authentically.\n\nSurvey Sample and Methodology: In December 2024, Intuit commissioned an online survey of 2,000 U.S. consumers age 18-35 years old. The survey focused on uncovering consumer trends and insights among Gen Z and Millennial demographics, with a particular emphasis on their perspectives on financial habits, spending, and financial wellness routines. Percentages have been rounded to the nearest decimal place, so values shown in data report charts and graphics may not add up to 100%. Responses were collected using Pollfish audience pools and partner networks with double opt-ins and random device engagement sampling to ensure accurate targeting and results.

Just trying to stay the course. We\u2019ve turned our season around since that Miami game [a 41-point road loss on Dec. 4]. We\u2019ve been really connected and we\u2019ve done a pretty good job.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re not going to let [Tuesday\u2019s] loss be the end-all, be-all for us. We\u2019re going to get better from this.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers will have as good as an opportunity as they\u2019ll get to put together a strong stretch of play \u2013 and possibly get healthier \u2013 during the next couple of weeks.\n\nThey\u2019ll play seven of their next eight games at their home arena and all eight in Southern California, including their debut at the Intuit Dome against the Clippers on Jan. 19, starting with Thursday night\u2019s home game against the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nThey won\u2019t have any back-to-backs over the next two weeks, providing more opportunities for practices and shootarounds.\n\nThe Lakers have only practiced once \u2013 on Dec. 30 \u2013 since acquiring Dorian Finney-Smith and Shake Milton in a trade with the Brooklyn Nets for D\u2019Angelo Russell, Maxwell Lewis and three second-round draft picks on Dec. 29.\n\nFinney-Smith and Milton didn\u2019t participate in that practice as they awaited the physicals for all players involved in the trade to be approved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get on the court together, that\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d Finney-Smith said. \u201cWhen we get two weeks [at] home, we definitely got to take advantage of that and get some wins. We felt like we should have won this road trip, but we didn\u2019t, so we got to fight and get wins at home.\u201d\n\nJarred Vanderbilt, who played just 29 games last season and hasn\u2019t played this season after having surgery on his feet in May, has advanced to full-court activities with contact and will be reevaluated during the homestand in about one week.\n\nThe defensive-minded forward played five-on-five against coaches Monday. The team wants Vanderbilt to play \u201ca few runs\u201d against other players \u2013 his Lakers teammates or players from the organization\u2019s South Bay G League affiliate \u2013 before he is cleared to return to the lineup.\n\nThe Lakers said on Dec. 3 that Vanderbilt was targeting a return for early January.\n\nIt isn\u2019t known if Vanderbilt will return during this home stretch, but there are encouraging signs that his return is imminent.\n\nWILDFIRE EFFECTS\n\nRedick said his family was among several who had to evacuate their homes on Tuesday in light of the wildfires that spread throughout Los Angeles County.\n\n\u201cI just want to acknowledge and send thoughts and prayers to everyone in the Palisades right now \u2013 it\u2019s where I live,\u201d Redick said on Tuesday. \u201cMy family and my wife\u2019s family, my wife\u2019s twin sister, they\u2019ve evacuated. I know that a lot of people are freaking out, including my family. And from the sound of things with the winds coming, I know a lot of people are scared. So I just want to acknowledge that. Thoughts and prayers, for sure. I hope everybody stays safe.\u201d\n\nJames posted on X (formerly known as Twitter) on Wednesday morning: \u201cPraying for everyone in Southern California!! !\u201d\n\nThe NHL postponed Wednesday night\u2019s Kings-Calgary Flames game that was scheduled to be played at Crypto.com Arena \u2013 the same venue where the Lakers are scheduled to host the Hornets on Thursday.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the Lakers-Hornets matchup was still scheduled to tip off at its original time on Thursday.\n\nHORNETS AT LAKERS\n\nWhen: Thursday, 7:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Crypto.com Arena\n\nTV/radio: Spectrum SportsNet/710 AM",

While an unpleasant thought, taxes might be a little less painful this year with TurboTax\u2019s new service.\n\nUsing the aptly named \u201c5 Days Early Refund Offering,\u201d TurboTax customers can get their tax refunds deposited into their bank accounts five days before IRS settlement. Of course, there is a fee for the service \u2014 $25. A refund deposited into a Credit Karma account, which is also owned by Intuit, is free.\n\nAccording to TurboTax, the average tax refund is around $3,000. The 5 Days Early Refund Offering gives taxpayers quicker access to their funds as long as the refund is $250 or more.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the FTC banned TurboTax from advertising free services, the financial services software company will still have its Refund Advance loan option, which does not charge any fees or interest when deposited into a Credit Karma account. However, customers will need to be approved and are limited to a $4,000 maximum loan.\n\nWhy Did TurboTax Introduce the 5 Days Early Refund Offering?\n\nTurboTax asked 4,000 Americans if getting their tax refunds faster mattered. Unsurprisingly, many of them said faster access to money would help them relieve some financial stress.\n\nAmong the respondents, 33% will use the money for essentials like food and medications. About 43% planned to put the refund in savings. Only 13% will go on vacation with the money, and 8% will spend it on entertainment. Interestingly, among Gen Z survey participants, around 19% will invest their tax refund in stocks, bonds, and even cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are proud to continue advancing our faster refund offerings as well as provide free do-it-yourself filing through our mobile app offer to arm our customers with the financial flexibility and security they deserve,\u201d said Intuit executive Mark Notarainni.\n\nWhile TurboTax does charge a fee for the 5 Days Early Refund Offering, it seems most tax filers are open to paying a bit more to get their refund faster. Per a survey done by PYMNTS, 39% would rather spend a little to get their money instantly than wait for the typical time it takes for disbursement of the funds.",

And this is a generation that prefers digital payments, as research by PYMNTS Intelligence shows.\n\nWith that in mind, TurboTax has introduced its 5 Days Early Refund Offering, which \u2014 as the name suggests \u2014 lets consumers have their refund delivered five days before IRS settlement for a flat $25 fee.\n\nIn addition, the company said it will continue to offer its refund advance loan to tax filers who need funds right away, with loans of up to $4,000.\n\nMeanwhile, other PYMNTS Intelligence research has found that consumers don\u2019t mind paying a fee to get refund payments early. While that study focused mainly on reimbursements for overpayments, consumer appetite for instant payments is much broader.\n\nFor example, the PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cMeasuring Consumer Satisfaction With Instant Payouts\u201d found that more than 58% of Americans who earn income for freelance, contract or consulting work would be willing to pay a fee to get their earnings instantly.\n\nSimilarly in \u201cHow Truckers Use Instant Payments to Support Their Lifestyles,\u201d PYMNTS Intelligence determined that 93% of professional truck drivers in the U.S. would choose to collect their paychecks instantly if that option was available.\n\nAnother study found that 78% of Americans were highly satisfied with receiving government disbursements, retirement distributions, dividend payouts and insurance settlements instantly.\n\nMeanwhile, PYMNTS wrote last month about efforts to provide faster refunds to consumers of retail establishments.\n\n\u201cReturns are part of any retailer\u2019s relationship with customers \u2014 and buyer\u2019s remorse can translate into a sticky customer relationship if returns and refunds are handled adroitly,\u201d that report said, pointing to research showing that merchants that anticipate an uptick in revenue are 31% likelier to offer online returns than those that expect no revenue change.",

It should be good policy as well.\n\nToday, the US tax code is over 6,000 pages. That\u2019s longer than the Bible, \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d and Robert Caro\u2019s \u201cThe Power Broker\u201d combined. That\u2019s a lot of pages and a lot of complexity.\n\nThe tax code wasn\u2019t always this complicated\u2014over the last 40 years, it has more than tripled in size. Even the Taxpayer Advocate Service has said that, \u201cUS tax laws are overly complex.\u201d When 6,000 pages is what stands between American families and what is often their largest check of the year\u2014there\u2019s a problem. That\u2019s why Intuit TurboTax was invented over 40 years ago.\n\nFor years, Intuit has been publicly calling for simplifying the US tax code so taxpayers can more easily understand their taxes. Simplifying the tax code means we can dedicate more resources to helping our customers file with ease, confidence, and help them keep even more of their hard-earned money. With this new year, and as Congress debates the extension of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), we\u2019re calling on this new Congress to help simplify the tax code for the benefit of Americans everywhere.\n\nHow does a simpler tax code benefit all Americans?\n\nEvery tax season, families look for ways to maximize their deductions and credits. Today, critical family benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit exist, but understanding eligibility and the filing process can be too difficult to navigate without help. In fact, the IRS reports that 1 in 5 qualifying filers fail to claim their EITC tax credit. At Intuit TurboTax, we ensure that eligible filers who rely on these benefits take advantage of them, but more work needs to be done for all filers.\n\nWe believe that everyone deserves a tax system that is clear, concise, and easy to navigate. This means eliminating unnecessary complexities and using plain language. A simpler tax code would save taxpayers time, money, and frustration while reducing the burden of filing taxes.\n\nWhy does Intuit want a simpler tax code?\n\nWe\u2019re all about serving our customers, and tax simplification is at the heart of that\u2014ensuring they\u2019re able to live the lives they want to live. \u2014 Mark Notarainni, Executive Vice President and Consumer Group General Manager\n\nAt Intuit, we\u2019re advocates for our customers, and one thing we hear from them time and time again is that the tax code is too complicated. How can they prepare or plan financially when the rules are nearly impossible to understand?\n\nTaxpayers overwhelmingly want a simpler tax code, and so do we. A recent survey found that more than 70 percent of taxpayers support making the tax code simpler and fairer, even if their personal tax burden remains the same. For all Americans, a simpler tax code means having a better understanding of their financial picture, using tax time as an opportunity to plan instead of guessing what the next year might bring. It also means less frustration and more time to spend on what they really care about.\n\nAt Intuit, our goal is to build financial confidence in our customers. A simpler tax code means we can support our customers with filing their taxes and getting their refunds faster. A simpler tax code would remove burdens on small businesses, help seniors and gig workers, and ensure that the wealthy and connected aren\u2019t the only ones who find all the tax breaks. It would allow us to dedicate more resources to developing innovative features and products, instead of having to update software to keep our customers ahead of the ever-increasing changes to the tax code.\n\nUltimately, we feel that no matter who files your taxes, the tax code is too complex. We believe that simplifying the tax code is how you make tax time easier for everyone.",

Insights into work, longevity, and retirement expectations are a key focus of the study. For this new generation, Prudential is also introducing the Beta Baby Bonus, offering $150 for parents of babies born in the U.S. on January 1, 2025, helping them begin saving for their child\u2019s future, with the potential to grow the amount to $100,000 if invested in the beneficiary\u2019s retirement savings. The amount also coincides with Prudential Financial\u2019s 150th anniversary this year.\n\nBrandon Goldstein, a financial planner with Prudential Financials, said, \u201cAs a first-time parent, I understand how daunting financial planning can be for a family. While you can\u2019t predict the future, you can plan for it from day one. My son\u2019s future starts with me and how we plan for it as a family. Most new parents think about updating their healthcare plans or insurance policies, but that\u2019s only the beginning. Reassessing your budget to ensure you\u2019re accounting for long-term savings goals and factoring in expected rising costs for the entire family is a critical step.\u201d\n\nThe research highlights significant concerns about the financial trajectory of Generation Beta, with 80% of parents agreeing that ideally, children\u2019s retirement savings should start from birth. The survey also reveals a prevalent regret among current and prospective parents: they wish they had saved more for their own retirement. Moreover, with 86% of respondents predicting that Generation Beta will have jobs not yet created and 68% expecting them to have more pets than children, the future of retirement and generational caregiving will be shaped by these evolving dynamics. Additionally, the report forecasts that Generation Beta will live longer than previous generations, with a notable optimism in healthcare that could lead to the cure of diseases like cancer. This increase in life expectancy will require substantial financial preparation, leading to 58% of the survey\u2019s participants believing that Generation Beta may never retire, estimating that they will need around $1.88 million for a sustainable\n\nUnlock the full report here: https://prudential.scene7.com/is/content/prudential/1084035_BetaBabies_Whitepaper\n\n\n\n\n\nKFC and Flybuy Collab to Launch for Saucy by KFC and Enhance the Customer Experience\n\nKFC is partnering with an AI-powered platform Flybuy to introduce a cutting-edge, tech-focused spinoff concept called \u201cSaucy by KFC,\u201d to transform the ordering experience for guests.

There, big names like Wale, Blxst, Tiffany Haddish, Lil Rel Howery, Khleo Thomas, O\u2019Shea Jackson, and more gathered for photos and community all in the name of loving professional wrestling.

Its range of features can support very small operations as well as growing companies that need granular reporting tools to assess different areas of their business.\n\nAlthough QuickBooks Online is user-friendly, there can be a learning curve, particularly if you\u2019re unfamiliar with the basic principles of accounting . Additionally, QuickBooks can be expensive for many small businesses, even more so if you add on time tracking or payroll. Several competitors offer simpler, more affordable alternatives to QuickBooks Online\n\nQuickBooks Online at a glance\n\nDouble-entry accounting \u2705 Automatic bank imports \u2705 Automatic transaction reconciliation \u2705 Unlimited users with at least one plan \u2716 Accountant access with all plans \u2705 Standard accounting reports (e.g., P&L, balance sheet, AP and AR) \u2705 Customizable reports \u2705 Industry-specific reports \u2716 Invoicing features \u2705 Inventory management features \u2705 Project tracking features \u2705 Mobile app \u2705 Business software integrations (e.g., payroll, HR, CRM, time tracking) \u2705 Live customer support \u2705\n\nHow does QuickBooks Online work?\n\nAfter you sign up for QuickBooks Online, you\u2019ll be able to log in to your account and access the main dashboard view. If you\u2019re moving to QuickBooks from another accounting software, you can import your existing files to your new account.\n\nThe main dashboard will give an overview of your QuickBooks account, showing your profit and loss overview, invoices, expenses and sales.\n\nUsing the Banking tab on the left side of the dashboard, you can connect your bank and credit card accounts so that QuickBooks automatically imports transactions and categorizes them for you. Later, when reconciling your books, you\u2019ll be able to review these transactions in the For Review tab within the Banking menu.\n\nNext, you can customize invoices, set up automatic sales tax tracking (if necessary) and learn how to enter mobile receipts and bills. You can edit all of your business\u2019s account settings using the gear icon in the upper right corner.\n\nIf you want to invite your bookkeeper or accountant to your QuickBooks Online account, you can do so using the My Accountant tab or the Manage Users page in Settings \u2014 you can also search for an accountant if you don\u2019t already have one.\n\nThis video helps explain how to set up and navigate QuickBooks Online.\n\nPricing and features\n\nPromotional discounts may apply. All plans include access to QuickBooks Online\u2019s mobile app, customer support and third-party app integrations. Add-on services \u2014 including QuickBooks Payroll and QuickBooks Time \u2014 will incur separate costs.\n\nPlan Pricing Features Simple Start $35 per month.

Here are a couple of features, in particular, that stand out:\n\nRecord-keeping and reporting: It\u2019s easy to keep thorough, detailed records with QuickBooks Online. When you\u2019re adding an expense, for example, you have the option of adding reference numbers, permit numbers, attachments and memos. You can also split the expense into multiple categories or items.\n\nYou aren't required to fill out every field in an expense or income entry, but the more detailed your records are, the more useful certain reports can be. For example, with QuickBooks Online Plus and Advanced, you can track inventory and do job costing \u2014 that is, you can figure out how much you spent to complete a certain project.\n\nEven without those higher-level plans, you can create custom tags and run reports to show where you make and spend the most money. These features can help you organize your finances and provide insights such as cost-cutting opportunities or sales trends that you can use to improve and grow your business.\n\nInventory management: With QuickBooks Online Plus and Advanced, you can track inventory and cost of goods, and set up reorder points. You can also create purchase orders, manage vendors and sync your inventory with third-party platforms like Amazon and Shopify.\n\nA wealth of software integrations\n\nQuickBooks Online gives you access to a marketplace of over 750 apps, including third-party software tools like A2X for seamlessly syncing your financial data between QuickBooks Online and a range of e-commerce platforms, and Fishbowl for advanced inventory and manufacturing management. Other apps can help you prepare for taxes, get business funding, run payroll, manage customer accounts and generate various financial reports and insights.\n\nQuickBooks also offers a few valuable add-ons. One of those is QuickBooks Live for bookkeeping . The solution is ideal for business owners who\u2019d like to step away from day-to-day bookkeeping tasks and outsource them elsewhere to save time. QuickBooks Time (formerly TSheets), another add-on, lets you track employee time directly inside QuickBooks and approve timesheets.\n\nSome apps (including QuickBooks Time and QuickBooks Live) have associated fees, whereas others are free.\n\nEasy-to-find resources\n\nWhether you decide to manage your bookkeeping on your own or work with a professional, you\u2019ll have no trouble accessing online resources for QuickBooks Online . The company offers video tutorials, webinars and training classes, as well as community forums, support topics and other resources on its website. You have the option of contacting QuickBooks customer support directly for any help you may need too.\n\nYou can also use QuickBooks\u2019 ProAdvisor network to find certified accountants and bookkeepers. Given QuickBooks Online\u2019s number of users, accountants outside of the network should be familiar with the software.\n\n\ud83d\udcac From our Nerds: What business owners say about QuickBooks \"Price is a common complaint about QuickBooks Online. I get it: There\u2019s no free option , and the basic plan isn\u2019t exactly cheap at $35 per month. Users on Reddit and elsewhere also like to point out that their costs keep rising, without getting much more for their money. \"From Oct. 1, 2023, to now (Dec. 2, 2024), QuickBooks did increase monthly rates for new customers. Some were largely in line with competitors ($5 more for Simple Start); others were bigger (Advanced leapt from $200 to $235). QuickBooks also stopped advertising 'free guided setup' on its pricing page \u2014 though that option appears to still be available if you comb through the fine print. \"Instead, QuickBooks is emphasizing its expert-assisted program. That service is free for 30 days and doesn\u2019t auto-renew. But considering that\u2019s another ongoing cost (live help options start at $50 a month), it doesn\u2019t exactly disprove another regular piece of customer feedback: Intuit\u2019s focus on upselling.\" \u2014 Ryan Lane, assigning editor covering small business\n\nWhere QuickBooks Online falls short\n\nPricing\n\nQuickBooks Online Simple Start costs $35 per month, includes only one account user (plus access for two accountants) and does not offer billable hours tracking, bill pay or inventory management. For multiple users, bill pay and the ability to add billable hours to invoices, you\u2019ll need to upgrade to the Essentials plan, which costs $65 per month. For inventory management, you\u2019ll need to opt for the Plus plan at $99 per month.\n\nCompetitors offer plans with lower monthly fees and similar features. For example, Xero ranges from $20 to $80 per month and includes unlimited users and basic inventory management in all plans. Similarly, FreshBooks ranges from $19 to $60 per month, with time tracking in all plans.\n\nAdditionally, as many online user comments and reviews note, QuickBooks tends to increase its prices more frequently than some of its competitors, and by making features such as time tracking an add-on rather than a built-in feature, it\u2019s easy for a monthly QuickBooks Online subscription to really start adding up. Add to that complex plan pricing structures, a push to move current and future customers to the Online product, and a culture of upselling, and the pricing becomes more opaque than several of the competitors that NerdWallet also recommends.\n\nAccount user limits\n\nQuickBooks Online allows up to a maximum of 25 users, and that\u2019s only with the most expensive plan. Other accounting software products, however, allow for higher user limits. And Xero allows for unlimited users at all plan levels.\n\nLearning curve\n\nThough QuickBooks Online has a handful of convenient features that can speed up your workflow and even automate some of it, the software can be complex. You'll get the most out of it if you have some knowledge of basic accounting concepts. Whereas you might be able to use some software alternatives without explanation, it may take some time to get the hang of QuickBooks.\n\nWatching tutorials, reading support pages or consulting experts for advice are all great options to learn how to use QuickBooks Online for your business.\n\nAlternatives to QuickBooks Online\n\nBookkeeping and accounting software Price Highlights Compare with QuickBooks Online Xero $20 per month and up. Xero competes with QuickBooks Online on nearly every feature, plus its monthly plans cost less. It\u2019s known for being simple, intuitive software that\u2019s quick and easy to get up and running with. Xero vs. QuickBooks Online FreshBooks $19 per month and up. FreshBooks is best known as accounting software that is ideal for freelancers and self-employed professionals, but its variety of affordable plan options and its extensive list of features make it a great choice for a range of small businesses. FreshBooks vs. QuickBooks Comparison Wave Financial Free and up. Wave offers accounting and invoicing software for free and is a solid choice for small businesses on a tight budget. Wave also has a paid plan that includes additional features and functionality. Wave vs. QuickBooks Online\n\nNerdWallet awards for QuickBooks Online\n\nQuickBooks Online earned the top spot in NerdWallet roundups for these categories:",

WWE via Getty Images\n\nAlthough the audience wasn\u2019t thrilled to see the WWE Hall of Famer, Hogan was keen to pretend like the jeering wasn\u2019t happening and proceeded to sling his Real American Beer brand.\n\nBut the most ironic part came when Hogan decided to show his appreciation for the wrestling community, which he\u2019s been a part of for over four decades.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had all kinds of tag-team partners over the years. But you, the fans, have been my greatest tag-team partner because you guys have stuck with me through thick and thin,\u201d Hogan said, backed by a booming orchestra of unforgiving boos.\n\nHogan then proceeded to tear his shirt off, revealing another shirt under it \u2014 a move not unlike the one heweirdly pulled during the Republican National Convention last year.\n\nHogan rips off his shirt at \"Raw\" on Monday night. WWE via Getty Images\n\nHogan\u2019s connection to the Republican Party \u2014 specifically, his incredibly loud support for President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 is perhaps part of the reason why he received such a salty reception in Inglewood.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, Hogan joked about body-slamming the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, and questioned her racial identity. He also proudly told the audience at the RNC that \u201cTrumpamania\u201d should \u201crun wild.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet Trumpamania rule again!\u201d he said at that event. \u201cLet Trumpamania make America great again!\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only reason why wrestling fans have seemingly soured on Hogan. In 2015, news outlets reported that Hogan had once been recorded using the N-word to refer to his daughter\u2019s then-boyfriend.He subsequently apologized for his use of offensive language \u2014 after the WWE terminated his contract \u2014 and called his remarks \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nAlthough Hogan may be on the outs with some WWE fans, they\u2019re going to have to deal with his continued presence to an extent; the wrestling promotion announced Monday that it has established a multiyear partnership with his beer brand and will be showcasing it at events.",

From going overseas for events to selling out multiple arenas, now is the best time to invest in WWE.\n\nThat is exactly what Netflix is doing, as the streaming platform, coming off the success of Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson, will start its $5 billion, 10-year deal with WWE\u2019s Raw show on January 6. The event is in the Intuit Dome, the new state-of-the-art arena of the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\n\u201cYou can see that Netflix wants to be in the live sports business \u2014 in live period.

If they capture a portion of those, it\u2019s a huge win for them and a huge win for us.\u201d\n\nThe event will feature a stacked roster, including world champion Cody Rhodes, Bianca Belair, Roman Reigns, CM Punk, the legendary John Cena, and more.

            "content": "The fact that multiple Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nView our latest analysis for Intuit\n\nIntuit Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe Executive VP and Chief People & Places Officer, Laura Fennell, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.1m worth of shares at a price of US$659 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$630. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.\n\nIntuit insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nNasdaqGS:INTU Insider Trading Volume January 5th 2025\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\n\nInsiders At Intuit Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Intuit shares. In total, insiders dumped US$7.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Intuit\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Intuit insiders own 2.4% of the company, worth about US$4.2b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.",

            "content": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Intuit ( ). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Fast Is Intuit Growing?\n\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Intuit managed to grow EPS by 11% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Intuit achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 12% to US$17b. That's progress.\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\n\nIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free ?\n\nAre Intuit Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince Intuit has a market capitalisation of US$176b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$4.2b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\n\nIs Intuit Worth Keeping An Eye On?\n\nOne important encouraging feature of Intuit is that it is growing profits. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts Our new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities. \u2022 Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n\n\u2022 Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n\n\u2022 High growth Tech and AI Companies\n\n\n\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.

            "content": "INGLEWOOD, Calif. \u2014 Covering a Kawhi Leonard comeback has become a formulaic process. Unfortunately, there have been so many instances of Leonard returning to play after an extended layoff that the guarded excitement is something few even have to speak of out loud. It\u2019s just a generally understood feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLongtime LA Clippers public address announcer Eric Smith said he wouldn\u2019t be able to believe that Leonard was truly back Saturday night against the visiting Atlanta Hawks \u201cuntil I was saying his name.\u201d Other members of the Clippers game staff felt positive energy, but also hedged in case Leonard wasn\u2019t quite ready.\n\nTwo hours before gametime, keen observers of Leonard\u2019s longstanding pregame routine waited for the two-time NBA Finals MVP\u2019s arrival onto the Intuit Dome floor. No one had ever seen Leonard get ready for a game at this building. Ten minutes passed \u2014 would he come out? After all, the Clippers ruled Leonard out for Saturday\u2019s game Friday evening, only to later upgrade Leonard\u2019s status to questionable 3.5 hours later.\n\nAt 5pm PT Friday, the LA Clippers ruled Kawhi Leonard out 3.5 hours later, they upgraded Leonard to questionable.@RHaylock asked Tyronn Lue why TLue: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hear from all these guys\u2026\u201d pic.twitter.com/PrqafsMxsT \u2014 Law Murray \ud83d\udd1c (@LawMurrayTheNU) January 5, 2025\n\n\u201cNothing changed. He was in,\u201d Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue went on to say. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hear from all these guys, so I tried to protect myself for as long as I could \u2026\u201d\n\nAll jokes aside, the Clippers took the long road with Leonard\u2019s return from right knee inflammation. The medical staff \u2014 led by longtime trainer Jasen Powell, president of performance health and wellness Maggie Bryant and assistant coach/vice president of player performance Todd Wright \u2014 worked with Leonard for months to strengthen a right knee that has been operated on multiple times since Leonard\u2019s career was interrupted in the 2021 postseason by a partially torn anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nThe Clippers front office reshaped the team, adding and/or re-acquiring players who could lead defensively, such as Kris Dunn, Derrick Jones Jr. and Nicolas Batum. The coaching staff was bolstered by the addition of former NBA head coach Jeff Van Gundy, the new de facto defensive coordinator, while Lue turned his offense without Leonard or the departed Paul George over to \u201cThe System\u201d James Harden, \u201cAddition-by-Subtraction\u201d Norman Powell and center Ivica Zubac, the longest-tenured player on the team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe efforts that the Clippers put in with Leonard rehabbing but also with the basketball team exceeding external expectations without Leonard gave way to the moment that fans had been waiting on for months: Leonard starting a game for the Clippers at Intuit Dome for the first time, and playing for a team that is relevant in the Western Conference. After beating the Hawks, 131-105, the Clippers are seventh in the Western Conference at 20-15, only three losses behind the second-place Houston Rockets.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been doing well all year,\u201d Leonard said of his team after finishing with 12 points in 19:25, establishing a playing restriction of 20 minutes.\n\n\u201cOf course he was on a minute restriction, but definitely from what we\u2019ve seen, or what we got to see thus far, was great,\u201d Jones said of Leonard. \u201cEven times he\u2019s been at practice, he\u2019s been great. He\u2019s been going at it, trying to get himself back to full form. That\u2019s all we can ask for, and we love it.\u201d\n\nClippers lead Hawks 44-35 with 8:24 left in 1st half Here\u2019s an updated Clippers depth chart to celebrate the New Kawhi Year pic.twitter.com/1gjuSwEUS6 \u2014 Law Murray \ud83d\udd1c (@LawMurrayTheNU) January 5, 2025\n\nLeonard\u2019s season debut did not come until 25 days after he first returned to practice last month. But Leonard\u2019s performances behind the scenes impressed his teammates, some of whom were also working to return to health and form.\n\nKobe Brown, their 2023 first-round pick, was sidelined for most of December with a back injury. Brown eventually was healthy enough to return to the Stay Ready crew that Leonard was tasked with working with as part of his return to play protocol. Brown recalled how Leonard made it clear that he \u201chadn\u2019t lost it at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a spurt when we were playing with the G League team; there was a spurt where he was hitting buckets back-to-back,\u201d Brown said. \u201cDefenders were draped all over him. Spin fades, like shooting rising up. You know how it doesn\u2019t matter how close you are to him \u2014 he just wasn\u2019t missing. I was like, yeah, you just got to tip your hat to stuff like that. He\u2019s a really good player.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked Brown if Leonard was silent the whole time he was slaying defenders.\n\n\u201cNah. He wasn\u2019t saying a word. Not a word,\u201d Brown said. \u201cQuiet assassin.\u201d\n\nLeonard came back and operated like a role player, almost in the Jones role \u2014 after all, it was Jones who Leonard replaced in the starting lineup next to Harden, Powell, Zubac and Dunn; although Lue said that Dunn and Jones will likely rotate as starters. Lue wanted Dunn as an extra ballhandler against a Hawks defense that is top five in opponent turnover percentage.\n\nAsked Tyronn Lue about the 5th starter decision, as Kris Dunn did not become a starter until November (replacing Terance Mann) while Derrick Jones Jr. has started every game (including preseason) that he appeared in. TLue praised both players professionalism in convos he had. pic.twitter.com/Wmj3hUaj3y \u2014 Law Murray \ud83d\udd1c (@LawMurrayTheNU) January 5, 2025\n\nLeonard did not have a true post up in his debut. His lone isolation possession was a quick shot to avoid a double team, and he finished only two plays as a ballhandler in pick-and-roll. He spent a lot of the game Saturday running to the corners as Harden operated. But Leonard\u2019s feel for the game was strong. There was a play in the first quarter where he cut into the paint as Zubac posted up. Leonard then reversed the ball back to the corner, where Powell was able to drive a Dyson Daniels closeout and finish with an easy layup.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of play that Lue envisioned for a player like Powell with Leonard coming back. Something that makes the game easier for the entire team.\n\n\u201cLast six, seven, eight games, they\u2019ve been blitzing Norm, trying to get the ball out of his hands,\u201d Lue said pregame of how teams have been defending Powell. \u201cNow, not having the best or second best defender on him, now he\u2019s going to have the third best defender on him. So, that will be a little easier for him. And then, we know that Kawhi is going to command double teams. So, the swing-swings, the wide-open Norm for 3s, I think he\u2019s third in the league in closeout situations at 1.46 points per possession. So, be able to get closeout opportunities, and I think he\u2019ll flourish even more.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday night, the Clippers also welcomed back Terance Mann, who had surgery last month to repair a fractured finger on his left hand. Mann explained how he and Leonard had \u201ctotally different schedules \u2026 he was playing 5-on-5, I couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d But Mann noticed how ready Leonard was leading up to Saturday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHis jump shot, he rarely missed during rehab,\u201d Mann said of Leonard after Saturday night\u2019s game. \u201cYou seen today, his catch-and-shoot 3s, he rarely missed. So, it\u2019s good to see that 3-ball for him, and everything else will come naturally to him. It\u2019s good to see where he\u2019s at mentally with his jump shot.\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s very first shot was a 3-pointer from the left wing from Harden. That\u2019s no small feat. When Leonard tried to play in Game 2 of the Western Conference quarterfinals against the Dallas Mavericks in April, he missed all five of his 3s. In Game 3, Leonard did not even attempt a 3-pointer. He made his first 3 3s Saturday night, and they were the first 3s he had made in a game since the last day of March 2024.\n\nLeonard did have one basket inside the arc where he was able to get into the paint and finish. Overall, he made only 4 of 11 field goal attempts, despite making 3 of 5 3s.\n\n\u201cI took the shots that I got,\u201d Leonard said afterwards. \u201cWe\u2019re still easing me into the game. We\u2019re on nobody\u2019s, I guess, timetable. Anybody watching, that wants me to score 20 or 30 points or be aggressive, we are not on no one\u2019s time frame. We know what\u2019s ahead of us, and we have to keep building in the right direction. So, we facing it like it was a preseason game tonight. And we\u2019ll keep moving the same way until I\u2019m able to build up my minutes.\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s defensive impact was still solid. The Hawks rarely even tested him. There was a play in the first half where Daniels half-heartedly tried to isolate Leonard, then wound up missing everything on a 3-point attempt:\n\nEven though Leonard is new to Van Gundy\u2019s defensive schemes, he doesn\u2019t feel that he is out of place in it at all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not an adjustment for me,\u201d Leonard said of being coached by Van Gundy defensively. \u201cHe\u2019s locked in. He watches a lot of film. He lets you know he watches a lot of film. He tells you, \u2018Nobody watches this s\u2014 more than me.\u2019 When you hear a coach say that, it gives you confidence as a player that you know what he\u2019s talking about when you step on that floor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeonard is a two-time Defensive Player of the Year winner, and his instincts for steals are still present. There was a play where Hawks forward De\u2019Andre Hunter was supposed to come off of a direct handoff from Hawks center Clint Capela. But Leonard completely blew the play up to start a fast break.\n\n\u201cAs a basketball player, I was definitely happy to see him,\u201d Hunter said after competing against Leonard for the first time since March 2024. \u201cI know he gets a lot of criticism, undeservedly. People who don\u2019t understand, like, people get injured. Would you rather him come back early and get hurt again, or take his time and be healthy? So, I was just more so happy to see him back \u2014 obviously, not against us.\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s return is just the middle of a five-step process. He got through step one last month when he practiced. Saturday night marked step two. Now, Leonard has to string games together \u2014 his preseason, his training camp. Next month, Leonard ideally steps up and is able to be the version of himself that plays at an all-league level. And what Leonard and the Clippers organization want to see is Leonard complete a postseason series.\n\n\u201cThe whole season, we\u2019ve had to fight and win without him,\u201d Brown said of Leonard. \u201cBut we started to see him ramp up more and more. We saw him every day beforehand, but you started to notice the ramp up. You know he\u2019s getting to that point. When he started playing fives and playing in practice, we knew it was close. So, we were just happy for him, happy that he took his time and he got back healthy \u2026 he looks like he\u2019s healthy. It was just good. He\u2019s a good dude. He stays in and around talking to people. He wasn\u2019t distant during the process. It was a good thing to see him back.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all in due time for Leonard. But for now, he has everything in perspective, and he knows that he can play still. That part is easy.\n\n\u201cIt was nothing hard about playing tonight,\u201d Leonard says. \u201cWe did the right steps to get me to this point. Playing basketball is the easy part of it. This is what I love to do. The hard part is not playing, and having to rehab and not competing with my teammates.\u201d\n\n(Photo: Harry How/Getty Images)",

He then found Norman Powell in the corner for his first assist and followed with a miss from 6 feet.\n\nAnd with that, Kawhi Leonard\u2019s comeback was officially rolling.\n\nLeonard made his season debut Saturday night in a 131-105 victory over the Atlanta Hawks after missing the team\u2019s first 34 games. And while it wasn\u2019t perfect, it was both a start and an end to a long road back from troubling knee issues.\n\nLeonard, who was greeted by the near-sellout Intuit Dome crowd with a loud ovation, finished his first game in 10 months with 12 points on 4-of-11 shooting, three rebounds and one assist in 19 minutes.\n\nLeonard had said his plan was to be ready for the season opener, but the inflammation in his right knee never truly ceased after flaring up on March 31 against the Charlotte Hornets. He sat out the final eight regular-season games last spring and appeared in only two games in the Clippers\u2019 4-2 first-round playoff loss against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nLeonard\u2019s knee problems kept him off the Olympic team and forced him to sit on the bench in street clothes for the first two-plus months of this season. Leonard, who has missed 290 regular-season games over the last eight years, including all of the 2021-22 season, seemed relieved to finally move from the training room to the court again after this latest frustration.\n\n\u201c(There) was nothing hard about playing tonight. We did the right steps to get me to this point, and playing basketball was the easy part of it,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThis is what I love to do. The hard part is not playing and having to rehab and not competing with my teammates.\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s 19 minutes were by design, and he will continue to be on a minutes restriction for the foreseeable future, which is just fine with the two-time NBA Finals MVP, who has had two surgeries and another procedure on his right knee.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still easing me into the game,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cWe are not on no one\u2019s timeframe. We know what\u2019s ahead of us and we have to keep building in the right direction. So, we are facing it (comeback) like it was a preseason game tonight and we\u2019ll keep moving the same way until I\u2019m able to build up my minutes.\u201d\n\nClippers coach Tyronn Lue and the rest of the team were understandably excited to see the two-time NBA champion back on the floor whether it was for nine minutes or 19. Leonard gives the Clippers another scoring threat, someone who opposing teams need to guard, leaving others open to score.\n\n\u201cWith his presence on the floor, it makes it a lot easier for everybody else, so it was good to have him,\u201d Lue said. \u201cNow he\u2019s got to continue to keep building off of it.\n\n\u201cWe are treating this as a preseason for him until he gets his legs up under him; make sure he comes out of the game tonight feeling good. And our goal is just to keep progressing every game and so tonight was a good start.\u201d\n\nLue started Leonard in place of Derrick Jones Jr., keeping Kris Dunn in the starting lineup. Jones came off the bench and scored 12 points.\n\n\u201cThat was amazing just to be out there (with him),\u201d Jones said. \u201cI\u2019m just happy he got his first shot to go down. When you come back from an injury or a long layoff, it always boosts you up a little bit. But once he got that, he started rolling, so he\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the team played well, too.\n\nNorman Powell got back on track after a 1-for-11 performance in the previous game and scored a team-high 20 points and had four rebounds. Ivica Zubac added 18 points and 18 rebounds, while James Harden had 10 points and 15 assists. Amir Coffey added 17 points.\n\nTerance Mann scored 12 points and had three rebounds in his first game in a month. He fractured the middle finger on his left hand in a Dec. 4 game against Portland.\n\nThe Clippers outshot the Hawks, 55.2% to 43.2%, and went 13 for 36 from 3-point range (36.1%).\n\nThree-time All-Star Trae Young led the Hawks with 20 points and 14 assists\n\n\u201cHe draws so much attention \u2013 double-teams and things like that \u2013 so I\u2019m able to finally get some catch-and-shoot 3s, playing off rotations, being able to track the basket,\u201d Powell said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s a lot easier than just defensively where we\u2019ve been playing.\n\n\u201cI think it fits him perfectly and it makes it hard for teams. You got so many guys that can switch and guard and defend one-on-one and now you got the help side. So, I\u2019m really excited. The first game look really good, so we just continue to build on that.\u201d\n\nWhether it was Leonard\u2019s presence, or the \u201cgreat vibe\u201d Mann talked about in the locker room before the game, the Clippers (20-15) came out inspired against the Hawks (18-18). After back-to-back lopsided losses, the Clippers opened a 29-14 lead before Atlanta closed the first quarter on a 14-0 run.\n\nThe Clippers, looking to avoid the kind of meltdowns they experienced in losses to the San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder, went on a 34-11 run to blow the game open with a 63-39 lead with 3:22 left in the first half. They led 74-54 at halftime.\n\nHarden had 13 assists in the first half for the third time in his career. His career-high for any half is 14.\n\nThe Clippers kept the pressure on Atlanta in the second half. With four starters on the bench, they managed to maintain a 20-plus-point lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nLue cautioned the team not to count on Leonard to handle the bulk of the scoring, which would have put undue pressure on the six-time All-Star.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great player, so he\u2019s going to find ways to be aggressive, score the basketball,\u201d Lue said. \u201cBut we just don\u2019t want to come back and force-feeding him and standing around.\n\n\u201cSo, the biggest thing for us is just to continue to play the game. Play the game the right way.\u201d\n\nGranted it was one game in Leonard\u2019s comeback and the first with the roster entirely healthy. Can it last?\n\n\u201cYeah, I think we have another level we could get to maybe two more levels,\u201d Mann said. \u201cKawhi is just getting his feet under him and we as a team are just getting our feet under us with him back. So, there\u2019s definitely other levels we can get to.\u201d",

Since then, he has torn through competition, amassing an 14-fight win streak and notching three title defenses. Dariush doesn\u2019t see Tsarukyan outgrappling Makhachev, but advises him to pressure the champion in order to find success on the feet.\n\n\u201cYou have to meet his feints,\u201d Dariush told Inside Fighting on Makhachev. \u201cHe does a lot of feints, a lot of fakes, and if you don\u2019t meet those he is going to be able to push you back, and he\u2019s going to be able to put pressure on you just with that. If you can\u2019t meet that, then it\u2019s kind of an uphill fight for you. But if you could start to meet those, you can start to see his reactions, what he wants to do.\n\n\u201cAnd ultimately to be able to beat him, you have to be very well-rounded, and I would say specialized in striking, specializing in grappling. He specializes in grappling. It\u2019s going to cancel out, but if you\u2019re good enough to grapple \u2013 you have good grappling but you specialize in striking \u2013 I think you can put more pressure on him.\u201d\n\nOn the same night, Dariush (22-6-1 MMA, 16-6-1 UFC) returns in a lightweight bout against Renato Moicano (20-5-1 MMA, 12-5 UFC). He hasn\u2019t competed since a knockout loss to Tsarukyan in December 2023.",

Joe Tessitore and Wade Barrett have been the broadcast team on WWE Raw since the late summer. They will host the post-show for the WWE Raw on Netflix premiere.\n\nAlicia Taylor also moves over from WWE SmackDown to announce WWE Raw.\n\nThank you #WWERaw on @USANetwork, it\u2019s been a pleasure! Can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s in store next week on the @netflix debut. @MichaelCole & @PatMcAfeeShow, you\u2019re up \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb@JoeTessESPN & I will see you on the Raw debut post-show \ud83c\udf7b pic.twitter.com/5xTcvXC4Bv \u2014 Stu Bennett (@StuBennett) December 31, 2024\n\nMatch Card\n\nThe Bloodline Saga Continues\n\nMatches years in the making will come to a head on the biggest stage WWE has ever created.\n\nAt Clash At The Castle 2022, Roman Reigns faced Drew McIntyre with his cousins Jimmy and Jey Uso banned from ringside. Reigns won the match when Solo Sikoa debuted as his new enforcer.\n\nSikoa was loyal to Reigns for two years. But when Reigns lost the Undisputed WWE Championship to Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 40, Sikoa saw his chance to move up the food chain.\n\nSikoa brutally attacked Reigns and brought his own enforcers Jacob Fatu, Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa to WWE. A war between the two bloodlines has kept us entertained over the end of 2024. Now, Reigns and Sikoa meet in Tribal Combat to decide who is the true Head of the Table.\n\nThis creates a perfect opportunity for The Rock to return to the WWE and show where his allegiances lie among his warring family?\n\nMeanwhile, McIntyre still can\u2019t forgive Jey Uso for his role in stopping him from winning the championship from Reigns all those years ago. McIntyre is on a one-man mission to hurt anyone who has stood by Reigns. He defeated Sami Zayn twice in December and is now moving on to Jey Uso.\n\nSeth Rollins And CM Punk: A Decade of Bad Blood\n\nIn 2012, CM Punk brought in The Shield to act as hired mercenaries. Reigns, Seth Rollins, and Dean Ambrose made up the group. Two years later, Punk walked away from the WWE and proceeded to throw dirt at the company.\n\nRollins strapped the company to his back and nearly broke it trying to keep the company on top of the industry. Punk worked for AEW where he further tried to hurt the WWE.\n\nWhen CM Punk left AEW and returned to WWE in late 2023, Rollins was irate. An injury at the 2024 Royal Rumble and subsequent trilogy of matches with McIntyre delayed things with Rollins until now.\n\nSeth Rollins vs. CM Punk is set to be the most physical and intense match on the card.\n\nTwo Top Women Meet Again\n\nLiv Morgan spent the entirety of 2024 trying to get revenge on Rhea Ripley who injured her and forced her to sit at home for the second half of 2023.\n\nA well-tossed chair by Morgan forced Ripley to vacate the Women\u2019s World Championship in April. The make things worse, Morgan won the title from Becky Lynch in Ripley\u2019s absence. She also got her claws into Dominik Mysterio and The Judgement Day \u2013 the group who had been fiercely loyal to Ripley.\n\nWith her former allies in her corner, Morgan has got the better of Ripley time and time again in 2024. Both women have vowed to start 2025 by putting an end to the feud that has engrossed 2024.\n\nThis match will decide a clear leader of the women\u2019s division during WWE Raw on Netflix. WWE\u2019s biggest female stars of all time \u2013 Becky Lynch and Charlotte \u2013 could see the climax of this match as the perfect moment to return from their respective hiatuses.\n\nMore From LWOS Pro Wrestling\n\nHeader photo \u2013 WWE \u2013 Stay tuned to the Last Word on Pro Wrestling for more on this and other stories from around the world of wrestling, as they develop.

Credit: Andrey_Popov/Shutterstock.\n\nSmall business owners and sole traders face heightened stress during the festive season, impacting their well-being and personal time, as the UK\u2019s Self-Assessment tax return deadline approaches, revealed Intuit QuickBooks.\n\nWith the January deadline for Self Assessment tax returns fast approaching, more than 12 million individuals are expected to file.\n\nThe period leading up to Christmas is said to be stressful for small business owners and sole traders, according to a study commissioned by Intuit QuickBooks and conducted by market researcher Censuswide in November 2024.\n\nThis survey of 2,000 consumers, required to complete a self-assessment, found that 63% experience stress during this time, with 28% sacrificing leisure time and 27% spending less time with friends and family.\n\nThe pressures of being a sole trader are significant, with the need to balance books, pay taxes promptly, and remain solvent in a challenging economic environment.\n\nIntuit QuickBooks UK product compliance & programmes head Pauline Green said: \u201cWith 63% of people finding tax returns stressful and over half (55%) admitting they procrastinate, it\u2019s no surprise that this time of year can feel overwhelming for small business owners.\u201d\n\nThe toll on mental and physical well-being is considerable, with previous research indicating a 56% average increase in stress levels when recalling the Self-Assessment experience.\n\nThe same study, conducted in November 2023, highlighted that 22% of the 1,257 sole traders and small business owners surveyed reported sleep disruptions and negative impacts on their well-being.\n\nDuring the last festive season, HMRC reported that more than 25,000 individuals filed their tax returns between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day.\n\nThe latest findings show that 11% use the period between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day to complete their Self Assessments.\n\nTo mitigate the mental health impact of these financial pressures, executive and leadership coach Jessica Rogers offers practical advice for maintaining financial health over this busy period.\n\nHer key tips include scheduling tax preparation before 20 December, prioritising challenging tasks, taking regular breaks, seeking professional support, and utilising technology to streamline administrative tasks.",

The best atmosphere,\u201d Simmons said.\n\n\u201cEverything Ballmer did, where there\u2019s no TVs in the lobbies, there\u2019s no TVs in the clubs, there\u2019s no TVs when you go and buy a hotdog, everything is built around, \u2018get back in your seats.\u2019 He wants people in there. He\u2019s got that whole section behind the court that really does [work]. They start chants, they do all kinds of things. There\u2019s more energy at those games than Laker games. They really have flipped this where the Lakers now look like they\u2019re the rinky-dink franchise with the Staples Center, which is just old now and doesn\u2019t have the same vibe as this Clippers thing. This is the first time the Clippers have ever turned the tables on the Lakers and made them feel like they are just kind of more modern and more on it.\u201d\n\nAsked by guest Kirk Goldsberry whether the energy at Intuit Dome could create to a real postseason advantage for the Clippers and finally make the Clippers feel like a home team, Simmons said yes.\n\nBecause it\u2019s Simmons, this take makes it hard to see where the Clippers praise starts and the Lakers hate ends. As a loyal Bostonian, Simmons will take a cheap shot at the Lakers any chance he gets.\n\nDo Angelinos agree that Intuit Dome is the real deal? That\u2019s hard to say, but Simmons is the first major sports voice to talk up Ballmer\u2019s passion project and start a fight between the fan bases.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the poll powered by Disqus.\n\n[Bill Simmons on YouTube]",

            "content": "TurboTax app offers way to file taxes for free, but what's the catch?\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption IRS unveils new income tax brackets and deductions for 2025 The IRS has announced key tax changes for 2025 due to inflation, including adjustments to income tax brackets, deductions, and capital gains. Straight Arrow News\n\nThe tax season hadn't even officially started in late December, but the TV ads already began tempting taxpayers with a free pitch to use the TurboTax app. Sure, some caveats apply.\n\nSo, I dug a little deeper into some of the fine print. What is the catch? Well, here's one you won't hear on TV: You'll pay \"regular pricing, which is based on the complexity of your tax return\" if you don't file via the mobile app by Feb. 18.\n\nYou'd need to download the TurboTax app and start and file your taxes yourself by Feb. 18 using the TurboTax app. \"Pay $0 when you file by 2/18,\" according to the TurboTax TV ad. You're eligible for this free offer if you did not use TurboTax to file last year.\n\nTurboTax notes on its website that someone who filed using TurboTax the year before last, but not last year, would still be eligible for this offer. The offer excludes TurboTax Live.\n\nFeb. 18 deadline is key to saving some money on a 'free' offer\n\nWhat happens if you don't have all your paperwork in order by February? Or your life gets so wildly busy that you end up filing after Feb. 18?\n\nThe TV ad doesn't go into such scenarios.\n\nBut the FAQ on the TurboTax website lets you know that you're on the hook for paying some fees if you don't meet that Feb. 18 deadline. The cutoff time to file is 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on Feb. 18. No prices are listed in the FAQ.\n\nAnd yes, you'd get hit with regular pricing if you switch to doing your taxes using a web browser instead of filing your tax return in the app.\n\nI fear that some tax filers might get confused and think they'd get free tax prep if they simply just start preparing that return before Feb. 18. But no, you need to file the return via the app by the Feb. 18 cutoff.\n\nThe promise: \u201cAll tax forms 100% free.\u201d\n\nKaren Nolan, a TurboTax spokesperson, said the complexity of your tax situation doesn't matter, neither does how many forms you are required to file with your return. It\u2019s free to file your federal and state returns, she said, if you file yourself in the TurboTax mobile app by Feb. 18.\n\nThe TurboTax free mobile app offer, she said, is \"the only free do-it-yourself federal and state filing option on the market available to filers of any tax complexity.\"\n\nTurboTax states online that the free app offer applies to \"any tax situation,\" not just simple returns such as what's covered by its TurboTax Free Edition. The Free Edition will not work for any schedules, except for the earned income tax credit, child tax credit and student loan interest. TurboTax notes online that some 37% of filers qualify for that option. That option can work for many with W-2 income and those taking the standard deduction.\n\nTax filers who qualify for TurboTax Free Edition, Nolan said, can file at no cost, well beyond the mobile app offer\u2019s Feb. 18 deadline.\n\nFree for many \u2014 but not all.\n\nIt's not surprising that we'd hear about a new app offer, especially when the Internal Revenue Service is expanding its new free online option called \"Direct File\" to millions of additional tax filers this tax season. Free is the new name of the game.\n\nWhat is the filing deadline for 2024 tax returns?\n\nMost people will be looking at an April 15 filing deadline in 2025. The IRS typically begins accepting and processing tax returns in late January. The official start date is expected to be announced the week of Jan. 6 or possibly later. Last year, the official kickoff date for the tax season was Jan. 29 for filing 2023 federal income tax returns.\n\nFiling a tax return is the very last thing many people want to think about when they're dealing with carb overload after the holidays.\n\nBut plenty of people rush to file tax returns in late January and early February to claim key tax credits, such as the earned income tax credit.\n\nA Feb. 18 deadline to get a free offer via the TurboTax app isn't totally unreasonable but meeting that deadline won't always be a slam-dunk.\n\nMost tax filers should have the common filing documents, such as W-2s and 1099s, that are required to be provided to the tax filer by Jan. 31 each year, according to Matt Hetherwick, chief program officer for the nonprofit Accounting Aid Society in Detroit.\n\nBut issues can crop up. What if your employer filed an incorrect W-2 and you need to get that fixed? What if the place you worked at last year went out of business and did not provide W-2 information? What if you thought you had all the paperwork you needed but somehow misplaced it at home? Maybe you can't dig through enough drawers to find it all by Feb. 18?\n\nHetherwick noted that in some cases former employees might also run into difficulty and some delays if they are not able to access a W-2 from a previous employer's payroll account.\n\nSome tax filers, he said, can face challenges when trying to obtain documents that could help them claim certain tax credits, such as the child and dependent care credit. Some day care centers, summer day camps, or other groups will need to provide you some paperwork.\n\nThese documents are not required to be reported to the IRS, but you need them to file an accurate return.\n\n\"There is not a deadline to provide these documents. Oftentimes, the onus is on the tax filer to request them, and they are at the mercy of the organization to provide them,\" Hetherwick said.\n\nWhen can you expect a federal income tax refund?\n\nFiling early does not guarantee that you'll have that refund cash in your pocket in a few weeks, either.\n\nThe IRS warns that you don't want to depend on receiving a tax refund by a specific date to cover a big purchase or major payments on your bills.\n\nSome tax returns take longer to process, the IRS states, if there are possible errors, missing information, or indications of identity theft or fraud.\n\nAnother key point: Under the law, the IRS cannot issue refunds before mid-February for tax returns claiming the earned income tax credit or the additional child tax credit. The IRS notes that it must hold the entire refund \u2014 not just the portion associated with these credits \u2014 until the review is complete.\n\nMore: IRS mileage rate for business goes up to 70 cents a mile in 2025\n\nMore: IRS warns about false promises of 'pennies on the dollar' tax settlements\n\nMore: IRS announces higher standard deduction, new tax brackets for 2025\n\nIs 'free' just another word?\n\nFree is a word that many consumers love to hear. Frankly, though, we all can hear what we want to hear and gloss over all the restrictions with some \"free\" offers. We've got to step back and ask: What's the catch?\n\nFree is overused in some ads and promotions \u2014 and sometimes consumer watchdogs warn some ads can be deceptive.\n\nIn 2022, for example, a $141 million multistate settlement was reached to cover about 4.4 million tax filers nationwide who, according to regulators, were tricked by TurboTax\u2019s owner Intuit into paying for free tax services in tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018. These taxpayers, regulators said, were told they had to pay to file even though they were eligible for the version of TurboTax offered as part of the IRS Free File program. Intuit admitted no wrongdoing. Consumers received money from the settlement in 2023.\n\nLast year, the Federal Trade Commission issued a final order finding that Intuit had engaged in a deceptive advertising campaign in 2022. The FTC stated that the \"vast majority of tax filers were not eligible for the 'free' version of the service. Instead, they were upgraded into costly deluxe and premium products.\"\n\nThe commission found that Intuit\u2019s \u201csimple returns only\" disclosure was not clear to most consumers.\n\nSamuel Levine, director of FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection, issued a statement last year that said Intuit must \"tell the truth about how many people are actually eligible for their supposed 'free' products.\"\n\nIntuit disputed the FTC's charges last year and filed an appeal of the decision with a federal court of appeals. As part of its statement last year, Intuit said: \"Intuit has always been clear, fair, and transparent with its customers and is committed to free tax preparation.\"\n\nThe 5th Circuit Court of Appeals heard Intuit\u2019s case on Nov. 4, 2024, and is reviewing the matter.\n\nDirect File has another free tax filing service that will help many\n\nA new free program offered through the IRS called \"Direct File\" will expand this year to cover more than 30 million taxpayers in 24 states, but tax filers in Michigan are not on that list.\n\nThe 24 states where the system that are expected to be up and running this year are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\nSome 140,803 taxpayers in just 12 states used Direct File to electronically prepare and file their income taxes in 2024, but government officials noted that the option wasn't available early in the tax season. This year, the numbers are expected to grow as more states are added and more tax situations will be covered.\n\nInformation will be added during the tax season at IRS.gov/DirectFile.\n\n\"Direct File will help enormously,\" said Nina Olson, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Taxpayer Rights, in an earlier interview with the Detroit Free Press.\n\nShe noted that low- to moderate-income families who qualify for the earned income tax credit face added challenges in covering the costs of getting their tax returns prepared or dealing with not having a regular bank account.\n\nOlson, who served as the National Taxpayer Advocate from March 2001 through July 2019, has long supported developing a way for taxpayers to file their taxes online directly through an IRS program to avoid high tax preparation costs.\n\nThe average U.S. taxpayer spends $270 and 13 hours filing their taxes, according to the federal government. Direct File, launched as very limited pilot program in 12 states in 2024, is designed to save do-it-yourselfers a buck and some time.\n\nBut Direct File has its limits. Direct File and the state tax authority work together to help a taxpayer file both their federal and state return. However, if someone has income from more than one state, and needs to file more than one state return, the person would not be able to use Direct File in 2025.\n\nIn addition, you cannot use the new Direct File system in 2025, if you have taxable income from the gig economy, rental income or business income. You also cannot use Direct File if you itemize deductions.\n\nThe IRS notes that you must report income earned from the gig economy on a tax return, even if the income is not reported on a form \u2014 like a Form 1099-K, 1099-MISC, 1099-NEC, W-2 or other income statement. Or even if you are paid with cash, property, or virtual currency.\n\nThe Direct File program is open to those with W-2 income, Social Security income, as well as unemployment compensation and some other sources of income. A long list of credits can be claimed by those who qualify and use Direct File as well, including the earned income tax credit, the child tax credit, the child and dependent care credit, and the retirement savings contributions credit.\n\nNo fees are charged. Direct File is available in English and Spanish. Tax officials say the program will work well on a smartphone, tablet or computer.\n\nOther options exist, too. Many low-income to moderate-income people qualify for free tax preparation assistance at Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites, including the Accounting Aid Society in Detroit, and Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs. In 2025, people who generally make $67,000 or less qualify for these services.\n\nMany do-it-yourself filers qualify for free tax software through the Free File Program at the IRS.gov website. The guided tax software is free in 2025 to those with adjusted gross incomes of $84,000 or less.\n\nThe IRS Free File Program is a partnership between the IRS and many tax preparation and filing software companies who provide their online tax preparation and filing for free.\n\nSaving a buck on your taxes is great in 2025, but you do want to figure out what \"free\" options might work best for you.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nLA Clippers star Kawhi Leonard was in the starting lineup for his season debut Saturday night against the Atlanta Hawks at the Intuit Dome\n\nCoach Tyronn Lue said Leonard is on a minutes restriction, but did not say how much playing time the six-time All-Star forward would get.\n\n\"This is like his preseason and training camp because he hasn't had that. Everybody who's playing tonight had a training camp and they played 30-35 games,\" Lue said. \"We're going to make sure we bring him back slowly. It's a great step in the right direction tonight, but we've got to make sure we're doing it the right way.\"\n\nLeonard has been sidelined all season because of inflammation in his right knee, and he and the Clippers have been extremely cautious with the injury. Last season, he sat out the final eight regular-season games and Game 1 of the Clippers' first-round series against the Dallas Mavericks. He returned to play in Games 2 and 3 but did not look like himself after contributing nine points and nine rebounds in Game 3 on April 26.\n\nLeonard was then shut down for the rest of the series, admitting that the inflammation was still troublesome. He hasn't played in a game since.\n\nLeonard was able to participate in USA Basketball's training camp in July before USA Basketball opted to replace him with Boston Celtics point guard Derrick White. Leonard did not practice with the Clippers throughout training camp and the preseason, taking an extra-cautious approach in hopes of helping the inflammation in his knee subside and trying to ensure it wouldn't return.\n\nThe Clippers have had surprising success this season without Leonard, going 19-15, second in the Pacific Division. Veteran forward Powell has stepped up for LA, leading the team with 23.6 points per game after averaging 13.9 last season.\n\nLeonard, 33, played 68 games last season, averaging 23.7 points, 6.1 rebounds and 3.6 assists.\n\nESPN's Ohm Youngmisuk and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "content": "World Wrestling Entertainment, better known as WWE, has survived scandal, controversy and seismic shifts in the media business. Next week, the pro wrestling franchise enters yet another new arena: Netflix.\n\nStarting Monday at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, WWE\u2019s popular weekly wrestling program \u201cRaw\u201d will stream exclusively on the streaming giant in the U.S., marking the first time in more than 30 years that it will not broadcast on linear TV.\n\nFor Netflix, it\u2019s the latest in a series of moves to grow the streamer\u2019s live TV business in an effort to increase viewership, subscribers and advertising dollars. For WWE, it\u2019s a chance to gain a massive global audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWWE Chief Content Officer Paul \u201cTriple H\u201d Levesque, himself a former pro wrestler, said the move to Netflix \u2014 with its 283 million global subscribers \u2014 is a \u201cgame changer\u201d for the franchise.\n\n\u201cThe reach and how much that can expand our base ... when you look at shows they do and the freedom that they have within that, it is a game changer for us,\u201d Levesque said at a media event last month in Hollywood. \u201cThis, at the end of it, is going to be called the Netflix era, because that\u2019s where the big change is.\u201d\n\nFirst launched in 1993 on cable TV\u2019s USA Network, \u201cRaw\u201d led to boom periods for the genre, said David Meltzer, a wrestling historian, the editor and publisher of Wrestling Observer Newsletter and longtime chronicler of the WWE.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRaw\u201d is known for promoting the careers of prominent wrestlers like the Rock (Dwayne Johnson), Triple H and \u201cStone Cold\u201d Steve Austin who launched to fame during the \u201cAttitude Era,\u201d which ran from the late \u201890s to early 2000s. Some of the biggest stars, such as Johnson and John Cena, found success outside of the ring in movies and TV.\n\nMeltzer called the deal with Netflix the \u201cnext evolution\u201d for WWE, and an important step as viewers \u2014 particularly younger audiences \u2014 have migrated from traditional television channels to streaming.\n\n\u201cWith the decline in TV, it\u2019s probably good to have eggs in the cable and streaming baskets,\u201d he said. \u201cThey reach somewhat different audiences, there are people who don\u2019t have Netflix and have USA Network, so it covers all the bases.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 10-year agreement with Netflix is valued at more than $5 billion, according to a regulatory filing. After five years, Netflix has the option to exit or extend the deal for another 10 years, according to the deal\u2019s terms. Netflix has the exclusive rights to \u201cRaw\u201d in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Latin America and will also be able to stream the show globally.\n\nIn 2023, WWE said it had signed a five-year broadcast rights deal for its other big weekly telecast, \u201cSmackDown,\u201d to air on the USA Network after its contract with Fox expired. Under the Netflix deal, the streamer will also be the home for other WWE programs and specials outside of the U.S. such as \u201cSmackDown,\u201d \u201cNXT,\u201d \u201cWrestleMania,\u201d \u201cSummerSlam\u201d and \u201cRoyal Rumble.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat it means is there\u2019s going to be a lot more eyeballs on WWE than there ever were in the past on a global basis,\u201d said Brandon Ross, an analyst at New York-based research firm LightShed Partners.\n\nRoss said putting \u201cRaw\u201d on Netflix provides stability in the streaming era and could spur more fandom and allow WWE to make more money from touring and sponsorships.\n\nNetflix executives said they were attracted by WWE\u2019s loyal, multigenerational audience. \u201cRaw\u201d also adds to Netflix\u2019s live offerings, which have included NFL games, boxing matches and comedy specials that can draw massive viewership and attract advertisers.\n\nThe move to Netflix is the latest in a string of changes for WWE in recent years.\n\nIn September 2023, talent agency owner Endeavor acquired the WWE and merged it with mixed martial arts league Ultimate Fighting Championship, or UFC, creating a $21.4-billion fighting sports and entertainment powerhouse, TKO Group Holdings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPublicly traded TKO is led by Endeavor chief Ari Emanuel, while UFC\u2019s president Dana White was named its chief executive. Wrestling impresario Vince McMahon, WWE\u2019s former CEO, was tapped to serve as TKO\u2019s executive chairman.\n\nMcMahon, who was credited with much of WWE\u2019s success, stepped down from the role in January 2024, one day after a former WWE employee, Janel Grant, sued the company, McMahon and former head of talent relations John Laurinaitis, alleging sexual assault, trafficking and emotional abuse. Grant claimed that McMahon agreed to pay her $3 million in exchange for her silence.\n\nAt the time of Grant\u2019s suit, a spokesperson for McMahon said in a statement to The Times that Grant\u2019s lawsuit was \u201creplete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and a vindictive distortion of the truth.\u201d\n\nTKO has said that McMahon is no longer involved in the company.\n\nMcMahon had previously stepped down as WWE\u2019s CEO in June 2022 following revelations that he paid millions in hush money to multiple women between 2006 and 2022 to silence allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nA WWE board investigation found that McMahon made at least $14.6 million in payments for \u201calleged misconduct,\u201d according to regulatory filings. McMahon denied the claims of sexual misconduct. He returned to the company\u2019s board in early 2023 as it explored strategic alternatives. (Linda McMahon, Vince\u2019s estranged wife, is now President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for Education secretary).\n\nDespite controversy, WWE has endured and continues to bring in money. Last year, WWE\u2019s revenue hit $1.3 billion, up 3%, according to the company\u2019s 2023 annual report. TKO\u2019s stock has risen 43% since it went public. Executives are counting on the Netflix deal to continue the momentum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWWE\u2019s President Nick Khan said a series of steps took place to enable the Netflix deal to happen, including Netflix\u2019s Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria, who was promoted to the role in 2023.\n\nBajaria called this a \u201cfull-circle moment\u201d for her. When her family moved from London to L.A. when she was a young girl, she would watch WWF (or World Wrestling Federation, the organization\u2019s earlier name) with her grandfather, who loved Andre the Giant.\n\nSo when TKO executives approached her about a year and half ago about WWE, she was interested.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, as a fan, all those early memories came flooding back,\u201d Bajaria said at a media event last month. \u201cThe more I learned about the business of wrestling, the more I felt like this could actually work.\u201d\n\n\u201cRaw\u201d could deliver a significant audience for Netflix. The series averages more than 1.7 million viewers in the U.S. on a weekly basis, according to LightShed Partners. The show has more than 1,600 episodes and has drawn celebrities like Bad Bunny to participate in matches.\n\n\u201cIn the WWE, you really have one of the most enduring and resilient programs out there,\u201d said Brandon Riegg, Netflix\u2019s vice president of nonfiction series and sports, at the media event. \u201cI think it fits in with a lot of the programming that we do, and it also expands the audience that maybe we don\u2019t have as much of an offering for right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it launches on Netflix, WWE \u201cRaw\u201d will still be a family-friendly, multigenerational program, Khan said. He said Netflix\u2019s international reach was a big draw. \u201cWe can\u2019t just be an American company, piping out American content, hoping that people will show up and tune in,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe have to be boots on the ground.\u201d\n\nWWE star Drew McIntyre said \u201cRaw\u201d going to Netflix could boost the careers of top pro wrestlers.\n\n\u201cOur product is so gigantic ... but I\u2019m kind of curious to see how much it\u2019s going to creep up in countries like America specifically, and just where you\u2019re going to start to see WWE superstars popping up, maybe on other Netflix shows,\u201d McIntyre said in an interview.\n\n\u201cI got a sneaking suspicion that my personal life outside my house is over,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we\u2019ll see, which is fine \u2014 just as long as wrestling gets as big as possible.\u201d\n\nNetflix delved into launching live events on its streaming service last year, first with a Chris Rock comedy special. Since then, it has livestreamed sports tournaments, a hot dog eating competition, Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Tom Brady roast and NFL games. The football games, which streamed on Christmas Day, drew an average of more than 30 million global viewers.\n\nNetflix drew criticism last month for buffering issues during its boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson. The streamer said it worked quickly to stabilize the viewing for the majority of its subscribers during the boxing event. The Tyson versus Paul match drew 65 million concurrent streams. Since then, Netflix has improved its systems to better handle live events.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Netflix executives discussed the issue last month at a media event, Levesque said it didn\u2019t bother him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just say, if it blinks a couple of times and we do 60 million, I\u2019m good with that,\u201d Levesque quipped.",

There are two Spanish-language spots and one French Canadian.

More than 10 million people who avail themselves of assisted tax preparation switch preparers every year, according to the company, and they continue to put up with pain points because they do not know there is a better way to do things.\n\n\u201c\u2018Now This Is Taxes\u2019 showcases the next generation of tax preparation, ushering in a new era of tax filing for both customers and accountants, that brings revolutionary, \u2018done-for-you,\u2019 solutions to the market,\u201d said Executive Vice President and General Manager of Intuit's Consumer Group, Mark Notarainni, in a release.\n\nThe campaign, from agency R/GA, made its first appearance during Netflix\u2019s streamcast of the NFL\u2019s Ravens vs. Texans game on Dec. 25. That spot promoted TurboTax\u2019s mobile filing offer and commitment to providing access to premium experiences for DIY filers who complete their taxes by Feb. 18.\n\nThe focus on its mobile app makes TurboTax the latest in a growing list of brands who are leveraging AI to enhance their mobile offerings, including Nordstrom and Burger King.\n\nThe official kick-off spot launched on Dec. 30, telling the story of a food influencer who ditches the waiting room of an accountant\u2019s office to use a TurboTax Expert through the app to get the work done on his time. The spot also promotes the availability of a $4,000 Tax Refund Advance loan.\n\nVirtual event / Free to access Assessing AI\u2019s Role in Marketing for 2025, from the editorial team at Marketing Dive.

Other storylines featured in the campaign include showing off the company\u2019s expertise for small-business owners and promoting the \u201cBeat Your Price Offer\u201d through which TurboTax will do the taxes of a filer who switches for 10% less than what they paid last year.\n\nThe campaign comes just after Intuit, which is the parent company of TurboTax, as well as Quickbooks, CreditKarma and MailChimp, announced the appointment of Thomas Ranese as its new chief marketing officer. Most recently CMO of Chobani, Ranese has also held positions at Google and Uber. He will report to Intuit\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer, Greg Johnson.\n\nLast year\u2019s tax season campaign from TurboTax was an appeal to Gen Z and millennials while showcasing some of the brand\u2019s initial AI-based tools.",

It\u2019s a sort of helping hand, offering guidance as to the best way to move forwards, which could be a real boon for anyone who struggles with managing personal money matters.\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve signed up for an account, you\u2019ll have your own log-in details, which will enable you to peruse personal credit scores from the leading names including TransUnion and Equifax. Being able to do this at your leisure and whenever it suits can be very handy as is the suggestions CreditKarma makes to help you navigate your money management chores.\n\nCreditKarma also offers lots of free advice even if you don't go on to become a subscriber. (Image credit: CreditKarma)\n\nCreditKarma: Performance\n\nMany of use lead such busy lives that staying on top of personal finances can be tricky. So aside from the desktop website, CreditKarma works best when it\u2019s used via the app. This means it\u2019s quick and easy to tap into the incredible array of help and guidance using Intuit\u2019s large-scale volumes of data. It also means that checking the latest deals of loans, credit cards and mortgages can be done on-the-go too.\n\n\n\nSuch is the level of information offered, both via the desktop website and through the app, Intuit has done a great job and users of CreditKarma might end up finding it their won one-stop shop when it comes to managing personal finances. It\u2019s all here, and everything seems to flow very nicely indeed too. So, it\u2019s a thumbs-up to CreditKarma on the operational front.\n\nCreditKarma: Ease of use\n\nAs expected, the slick CreditKarma website and app combination works every bit as easily as other products in the Intuit portfolio. This is a big company, with seemingly endless resources so it\u2019s little wonder that using the CreditKarma features and functions is a breeze. However, it\u2019s interesting that Intuit also owns budgeting app Mint, which was very popular with lots of people.\n\n\n\nSince the acquisition though, Intuit has closed down the apparently loss-making Mint and now points customers in the direction of CreditKarma. Some users who have done this report that it\u2019s not such plain sailing and another complaint is that there are less budgeting features and functions on offer compared to Mint. However, CreditKarma does make it immediately obvious that it is more concerned with offering advice on credit scores. And for that purpose, it seems to work well enough.\n\n(Image credit: CreditKarma)\n\nCreditKarma: Support\n\nThere\u2019s not too much to go wrong with CreditKarma as the areas where it gives you an overview of your credit scores and the information relating to how that is shaped proves straightforward. In that respect, it seems unlikely that help will be needed for users dipping in and making the most of the free service. Anyone who does come unstuck is pointed to the Help Center, which is, in essence, an online portal offering predetermined answers to questions. It is comprehensive, mind.\n\nCreditKarma: Final verdict\n\nOn initial inspection, CreditKarma is impressive enough with lots of tools that purport to help you better manage your personal finances. However, dig a little deeper and there are obviously lots of features and functions that have the potential to draw users deeper into the world of personal loans, offers of credit and other such schemes.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that per se, but anyone using CreditKarma who isn\u2019t confident with their own financial management processes will want to tread carefully. It doesn\u2019t cost anything to sign up, so CreditKarma is worth an experimental look. The comprehensive advice sections on the website could prove handy too, but there isn\u2019t anything here that can\u2019t be found elsewhere, as our best personal finance software guide attests only too well.",

Both superstars unleashed a barrage of verbal jabs, aiming to gain a psychological advantage before their highly anticipated one-on-one showdown on the red brand's Netflix premiere.\n\nSpeaking on a recent episode of Busted Open, Dolph Ziggler highlighted the importance of The Second City Saint and The Visionary to WWE's Netflix deal.

(Photo by Carmen Mandato/Getty Images)\n\nJamahal Hill and Jiri Prochazka, both former UFC light heavyweight champions, are slated to face off at UFC 311 on January 18, 2025, inside the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California. The bout pits two fighters looking to bounce back from crushing knockout losses at the hands of current champion, Alex Pereira. Hill fell to Pereira at UFC 300, while Prochazka found himself on the same losing end at UFC 303. The stakes are clear\u2014this fight could decide who gets back into title contention.\n\nRanked fourth in the division, Hill is technically chasing No. 2 Prochazka on paper. However, the odds have painted a more even picture.\n\nHow Odds Shift in High-Profile UFC Matchups\n\nBetting odds for UFC bouts often swing dramatically, especially in matchups like Jamahal Hill versus Jiri Prochazka. Hill opened as a slight favorite at -125, but shifts in public sentiment and wagers quickly moved him to -107 against Prochazka\u2019s -113. These fluctuations aren\u2019t uncommon in high-profile fights where fans and analysts constantly reassess their predictions.\n\nChanges like these can be influenced by external factors\u2014fighter interviews, training footage, or insights shared by experts. For example, platforms like Bet365 capture these changes in real time, reflecting how quickly odds can react to even minor updates in the lead-up to the fight.\n\nJon Jones Weighs In\n\nFormer light heavyweight champion Jon Jones has added his voice to the ongoing discussion about the matchup. Jones, known for his dominance in the division, believes Hill might have the edge.\n\n\u201cI think Jamahal Hill will win,\u201d Jones said. \u201cJiri has really unorthodox striking, but Jamahal seems like the more technical, more clean striker. I\u2019m a big fan of basic techniques, and Jamahal has a really strong, basic, clean kickboxing style.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019s endorsement is noteworthy, given Hill\u2019s recent struggles and the questions surrounding his ability to recover after a lopsided defeat to Pereira. Jones\u2019s comments also highlight Prochazka\u2019s eccentric yet potentially exploitable approach in the octagon.\n\nStakes for Both Fighters\n\nFor Hill, this fight is pivotal to reestablishing his standing in a highly competitive division. With fighters like Pereira and other contenders in the mix, another loss would likely push him further down the rankings. Hill\u2019s career momentum, briefly peaking when he claimed the belt, now hangs in the balance.\n\nOn the other hand, Prochazka faces pressure to avoid a second consecutive defeat. Known for his unpredictable striking and aggression, another loss could raise doubts about his ability to hold up against disciplined fighters like Hill or Pereira. Unlike Hill, who relies on a foundation of clean striking, Prochazka\u2019s success often stems from chaos inside the cage.\n\nIn a division as stacked as light heavyweight, this fight could decide one fighter\u2019s path forward while closing the door for the other. With the betting odds nearly even and the stakes undeniably high, it is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched bouts of UFC 311.\n\nSINGAPORE, SINGAPORE \u2013 JUNE 12: Jiri Prochazka of Czech Republic prepares to fight Glover Teixeira of Brazil in the UFC light heavyweight championship fight at Singapore Indoor Stadium on June 12, 2022 in Singapore.

Social Media Management\n\n\u201cGen Z grew up with social media, and they\u2019re good at identifying what\u2019s good and what\u2019s going to sell, which makes them especially adept at managing social media pages,\u201d said Melanie Musson, a finance expert with Clearsurance.com. \u201cMany businesses have expert employees who run and serve the business but lack someone to manage their social media pages effectively.\u201d\n\nSocial media management can be an excellent side gig for someone who enjoys creating content or spending time on various platforms. While building your own following can be time-consuming and exhausting, you could benefit from managing pages for a local business.\n\nIf you grew up on social media and work remotely, you may have some spare time to complete tasks that feel simple to you. For example, if you have a keen eye for spotting trends or enjoy storytelling, you could land a job as a social media manager. If you know how to build a following or have acquired graphic design skills, you could also offer this as a service in the social media management field.\n\nAccording to ZipRecruiter, you can earn $31 per hour for this role in your spare time. The work involved can vary from managing an Instagram presence for a local business to helping create content for a major account.\n\nTrending Now: Get Paid To Watch Videos \u2014 11 Easy Ways\n\n2. Pet Sitting and Dog Walking\n\n\u201cMany members of Gen Z are in the position to be flexible with where they stay, so they can be open to staying in or checking in on people\u2019s homes and/or pets while they\u2019re on vacation,\u201d noted Musson.\n\nGen Z should consider a house and pet-sitting side gig if they\u2019re looking for an easy side hustle to fit into a regular schedule. If you work remotely and have a flexible schedule, dog or house sitting is a relatively easy way to make extra money without a significant commitment.\n\nWhile the average hourly salary for house sitting is $17 per hour, the money can add up if you spend a few days or a weekend staying with someone. If you work remotely, you can use house sitting as a way to change up your scenery, as well, so that you\u2019re not always in the same environment.",

Fans will be eagerly awaiting what Cena has to say on January 6 about his aspirations for his final year in WWE.\n\nLogan Paul vs. John Cena Rumors: What\u2019s the Truth?\n\nRecent rumors have suggested a possible match between John Cena and Logan Paul at Raw\u2019s Netflix debut, but insider WrestleVotes has dismissed these claims. In a recent Live Q&A on Backstage Pass, WrestleVotes clarified that while WWE is interested in booking Cena vs. Paul, it\u2019s unlikely to happen at the Netflix Raw debut.

            "content": "The Champion is scheduled for her sixth title defense\n\nWWE Women\u2019s World champion Liv Morgan recently took to her Instagram handle to reveal her New Year\u2019s resolution outlining her goals in WWE for 2025. Morgan will defend her title for the sixth time next week.\n\nMorgan is scheduled to defend the title against her fierce rival Rhea Ripley at the Monday Night Raw debut episode on Netflix. The debut episode is scheduled for January 6 at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California.\n\nAhead of her title defense, Liv Morgan posted a story on her Instagram handle where she outlined her goals and ambitions for 2025. From a dominant title reign to the continuation of the revenge tour, Liv\u2019s resolution showcases her drive to stay on top.\n\nMorgan shared five resolutions in total, starting with defeating \u201cdiarrhea\u201d (Rhea Ripley) for the final time. Her second resolution is to remain on top as the greatest Women\u2019s World Champion. The third resolution simply reads \u201cDaddy Dom Daddy Dom,\u201d accompanied by two smiling faces and a heart emoji.\n\nLiv\u2019s fourth resolution is to continue the \u201cLiv Morgan World Tour,\u201d suggesting her ongoing title reign and dominance globally. Similar to her third resolution the fifth and final resolution simply reads \u201cLivDom LivDom\u201d with two black heart emoji.\n\nAfter an insane 2024, Liv Morgan has some resolutions for her Revenge Tour '25. \u2728 Get the latest Liv Morgan hoodie from the link below \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/bB9DFUhbne \u2014 Sportskeeda Wrestling (@SKWrestling_) January 1, 2025\n\nLiv Morgan and Rhea Ripley will face off in a last-woman standing match\n\nAs mentioned above, Morgan will defend the title against Rhea in a last-woman standing match at the debut show of the Red brand. Apart from this three more matches have been announced for the debut show next week.\n\nAlso Read: All matches confirmed for WWE RAW\u2019s Netflix debut in 2025\n\nMorgan and Ripley are engaged in a fierce feud that initially began in April and reached its peak when Dominik Mysterio betrayed Ripley and sided with Liv at SummerSlam 2024. Ripley was then kicked out of the Judgment Day faction, a stable that consisted of Ripley, Dirty Dom, Finn Balor & Damian Priest.\n\nThe two stars met for the second time at Bad Blood 2024 and Ripley was determined to get the title back, a title which she never lost. Ripley was attacked by a returning Raquel Rodriguez who joined hands with Morgan and attacked her causing the disqualification.\n\nThis meant Ripley won the match, but since the victory came via disqualification, Morgan retained her title. Now, the two rivals will meet at the Intuit Dome for the third time, where Morgan will aim to extend her 221-day title reign, while Rhea will look to exact her revenge and capture the title for the second time in her career.\n\nWho do you think will emerge victorious in the last Woman Standing clash? Do you think the Judgment Day will interfere in the match to help Liv Morgan?

            "content": "Ali Abdelaziz made a very bold statement about UFC lightweight champion Islam Makhachev.\n\nMakhachev (26-1 MMA, 15-1 UFC) runs things back with Arman Tsarukyan (22-3 MMA, 9-2 UFC) Jan. 18 in the UFC 311 main event from Intuit Dome in Inglewood, Calif., and airs on ESPN+ pay-per-view following prelims on ESPN and ESPN+.\n\nThe fight marks a rematch after Makhachev defeated Tsarukyan by unanimous decision in April 2019, in what was Tsarukyan\u2019s UFC debut.\n\nAbdelaziz, who like many others regards his client as the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter in the sport ahead of UFC 311, is so high on Makhachev, that he even sees him being a bad stylistic matchup for UFC light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira (12-2 MMA, 9-1 UFC).\n\n\u201cHe had a situation in the first fight (with Tsarukyan), I\u2019m not going to make excuses for him,\u201d Abdelaziz told MMA Junkie. \u201cArman is an absolute beast, he\u2019s very tough \u2013 I think Arman will be a champion, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s now. It\u2019s not his time. He\u2019s young. I don\u2019t think any man from 155 pounds to 185 pounds can beat Islam Makhachev. It doesn\u2019t exist. I believe 155, 170, 185, I think Islam can beat anybody at any given day.\n\n\u201cThis is what I believe in because what he\u2019s shown me, the development, the improvement. I think Islam will beat Alex Pereira at 205, I do. I swear to Allah. I think Islam Makhachev will beat Alex Pereira. He\u2019s just going to take him down and finish him, submit him. Alex Pereira can knock out anybody on the planet if he touches you, but I think Islam Makhachev is this good. \u2026Skill for skill, I think he\u2019s one of the best fighters, most complete fighters we\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s not Demetrious Johnson, it\u2019s nobody.\u201d\n\nAbdelaziz also disagrees with Dana White\u2019s statement that UFC heavyweight champion Jon Jones is the pound-for-pound No. 1 fighter. He thinks Makhachev\u2019s resume has been more impressive than \u201cBones,\u201d and he\u2019s deserving of his top spot in the official UFC rankings.\n\n\u201cThe man finished seven of his last eight opponents,\u201d Abdelaziz said of Makhachev. \u201cHe beat the pound-for-pound No. 1 ranked. The caliber of fighters he beat is not like who Jon Jones beat, and that\u2019s no disrespect to Jon Jones. He\u2019s amazing, but he\u2019s beaten Ciryl Gane, who can\u2019t wrestle. He beat Stipe (Miocic), who\u2019s a grandfather.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s old. He\u2019s a legend of course. Islam Makhachev didn\u2019t go to a split decision with Thiago Santos. It doesn\u2019t happen. He smashes people\u2019s faces. He makes them look like they don\u2019t even belong there, but we\u2019re going to see. Jan. 18, one more for Islam Makhachev, and I think he\u2019s going to make it look easy.\u201d\n\nFor more on the card, visit MMA Junkie\u2019s event hub for UFC 311.",

            "content": "When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stock is up an impressive 140% over the last five years.\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Intuit\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Intuit achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 19% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 61.24.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nNasdaqGS:INTU Earnings Per Share Growth December 30th 2024\n\nWe know that Intuit has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Intuit the TSR over the last 5 years was 148%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIntuit shareholders are up 2.8% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 20% over five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Intuit has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.",

            "content": "By design, filing taxes is painful. So much so that 56% of Americans dread doing it and 26% say they hate it, per Pew Research .\n\nTurboTax has built its business around this collective grumble, making it easier for people to submit to the IRS in a few clicks. Now, before the April 2025 tax filing deadline, it\u2019s reframing its brand with the launch of a media blitz that has Gen Z firmly in its sights.\n\nThe Intuit-owned brand has launched \u201cNow This Is Taxes,\u201d a new campaign developed by agency of record R/GA.\n\nThe push debuts with six hero spots that highlight the company\u2019s mobile AI-powered tech. TurboTax says these tools let tax filers access a qualified expert and complete the ordeal in as little as two hours.\n\nThe films focus on elements including ease of use, speed, user experience, business customers, and the fixed price of its full-service product.\n\n\u201cStorytelling through product can be difficult,\u201d Trevor Kelley, Intuit\u2019s, vp of consumer marketing told ADWEEK. But he believes the result is a campaign that balances functionality with purpose.\n\nCourting Gen Z\n\nTurboTax is in its second tax season working R/GA. The agency has helped it take a fresh approach to what can be a dry subject, launching campaigns including an R&B spot with Workaholics star Adam DeVine and its 2024 Super Bowl campaign, \u201cMake Your Moves Count.\u201d\n\nAs it faces increased competition from rivals including H&R Block and TaxSlayer, such lighter creative endeavors precede a 2025 plan for TubroTax to plant itself deeper into pop-culture moments. The aim? To engage younger consumers and capture what Kelley describes as \u201clow complexity\u201d filers.\n\nWith 25% of Gen Zers saying filing taxes makes them want to consult with a therapist, Kelley has the demographic firmly in his sights.\n\n\u201cPositive metrics around Gen Z would be a great outcome\u201d of the campaign, Kelly said, pointing to an opportunity to build loyalty among young people setting up their filing habits for life.\n\nA diversified media mix will support this goal. The brand already launched one of the hero spots for the campaign during Netflix\u2019s NFL Christmas games.\n\nThe campaign will see the brand through 2025, showing up at tentpole events including the Oscars, the Grammy\u2019s, and Netflix\u2019s WWE Raw premiere. TikTok and Snapchat will also play a key role in the media mix, while budget will also go into audio and podcasts, as well as local search.\n\n\u201cMass media will continue to be a part of what we do and how we reach consumers,\u201d said Kelley. \u201cBut we\u2019re also looking at different ways of marketing, so we\u2019ve begun to hone in a bit on how customers make their decisions on [picking] a filing solution. Many are doing so through more direct channels.\u201d\n\nTurboTax\u2019s Superbowl Swagger\n\nOne of the brand\u2019s largest commitments to mass media will come in February when it debuts its 12th consecutive Big Game spot in the second half of Super Bowl LIX.\n\nKelley is tight-lipped about what the big Big Game spot will hone in on, but confirms it will be part of the \u201cNow This Is Taxes\u201d platform. \u201cWe want some of that bold advertising swagger that comes with the Super Bowl, so this is a great opportunity for this campaign,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTiming-wise, it\u2019s a very pivotal point in the tax year,\u201d he continued.\n\nWith brands including Microsoft using last year\u2019s Super Bowl to amplify their gen-AI features, Kelley declines to elaborate on whether TurboTax will use the Big Game to spotlight tools including the AI-powered Intuit Assist.\n\nHowever, amid backlash from consumers over how brands such as Spotify, Google, and Apple promote and use gen-AI in their ads, Kelley believes that showcasing the advantages of the tech\u2014such as speed and lower pricing\u2014rather than shouting about its use is key.\n\n\u201cHow these things get to a customer is not as important as the actual benefits,\u201d he said.\n\nIn November, Intuit reported 10% year-over-year revenue growth to $3.3 billion for the most recent quarter. Changes at the top of the business, which also owns QuickBooks, MailChimp, and Credit Karma, will come in 2025.\n\nIn November, longtime CMO Lara Hood Balazs departed for Adobe. She will be replaced by Google veteran and former Chobani CMO Thomas Ranese.\n\nUnder Hood Balazs, Intuit began experimenting with a \u201cbranded house strategy,\u201d designed to push the Intuit name into consumer consciousness, alongside its roster of individual brands.\n\nThe \u201cNow This is Taxes\u201d campaign, which will include a tie-up with Credit Karma, will continue to push the Intuit brand overall.",

            "content": "Intuit INTU had a strong start in fiscal 2025, delivering 10% revenue growth to reach $3.3 billion in the first quarter. The company's transformation into an AI-driven expert platform is yielding results, particularly visible in its Global Business Solutions Group. Its Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 20% marked a two-percentage-point acceleration from the previous quarter, coupled with Credit Karma's 29% revenue surge, thus demonstrating the successful execution of the company's digital initiatives.\n\nCore Business Performance\n\nQuickBooks Online Accounting maintained strong momentum with 21% revenue growth, driven by customer expansion, higher effective pricing and favorable product mix-shift. The Online Services segment grew 19%, bolstered by money management, payroll, and Mailchimp offerings. A 17% increase in payment volume underscores healthy transaction activity, while the Money segment showed particular strength in personal loans, auto insurance and credit cards.\n\nStrategic Market Expansion\n\nIntuit's mid-market strategy is gaining significant traction, with QuickBooks Online Advanced and Intuit Enterprise Suite posting approximately 42% growth in Online Ecosystem revenues. The company has successfully built a base of 800,000 mid-market customers, targeting an addressable market of $89 billion. International expansion efforts are showing promise, with Online Ecosystem revenues growing 10% on a constant currency basis, supported by a differentiated approach in established and emerging markets.\n\nTransitions and Challenges\n\nThe Desktop Ecosystem segment faced headwinds with a 17% revenue decline as the company transitions to a recurring subscription model. However, management projects a return to growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, with low single-digit growth expected for the full fiscal year. Mailchimp encounters elevated churn rates among smaller customers, though the company is actively addressing this through product enhancements and improved feature adoption strategies.\n\nAI Innovation Leadership\n\nThe successful deployment of Intuit Assist, now available to all U.S. QuickBooks Online customers, showcases the company's commitment to AI innovation. The platform demonstrates tangible benefits, helping customers receive payments 45% faster and offering automated accounting features. This strategic integration of AI positions Intuit at the forefront of financial technology innovation.\n\nFinancial Position and Shareholder Returns\n\nIntuit maintains a solid financial position with approximately $3.4 billion in cash and investments, balanced against $6.1 billion in debt. The company's commitment to shareholder returns remains strong, as evident from its $570 million stock repurchases during the first quarter and a 16% increase in quarterly dividend to $1.04 per share. This reflects management's confidence in the company's financial outlook and cash flow generation capabilities.",
