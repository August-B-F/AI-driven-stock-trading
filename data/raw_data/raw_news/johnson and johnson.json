J&J rival Eli Lilly and Co. announced in late February that it planned to build four new factories in the U.S. Both Lilly and J&J cited tax cut legislation passed in 2017 as factors in their U.S. investments.\n\nJohnson & Johnson said Friday that it is a 25% increase in investment compared with the prior four years and estimates the U.S. economic impact will be more than $100 billion a year.\n\n\u201cOur increased U.S. investment begins with the ground-breaking of a high-tech facility in North Carolina that will not only add U.S.-based jobs but manufacture cutting edge medicines to treat patients in America and around the world,\u201d Chairman and CEO Joaquin Duato said in a statement.\n\nThe North Carolina plant is in Wilson, just east of Raleigh. The locations of the other three facilities were not disclosed.\n\nAside from building four new plants, Johnson & Johnson said that it will expand several existing sites. The company is also planning to make investments in research and development infrastructure and technology.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s efforts are among several companies pledging to enhance their manufacturing in the U.S. Earlier this month chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said that it plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S., on top of $65 billion in investments the company had previously announced.\n\nIn February Apple announced that it plans to invest more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, including plans to hire 20,000 people and build a new server factory in Texas.\n\nApple outlined several concrete moves in its announcement, the most significant of which is the construction of a new factory in Houston \u2014 slated to open in 2026 \u2014 that will produce servers to power Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI features.\n\n___\n\nAP Health Writer Tom Murphy contributed to this report.",

Symptoms vary, but often include abdominal pain and tenderness, frequent diarrhoea, rectal bleeding, weight loss and fever.\n\nOffering both subcutaneous and intravenous induction options for CD, Tremfya is designed to block IL-23, an important driver of immune-mediated diseases, while also binding to CD64, a receptor on cells that produce IL-23.\n\nChris Gasink, vice president, medical affairs, gastroenterology and autoantibody, J&J Innovative Medicine, outlined that Tremfya is \u201cthe first and only IL-23 inhibitor that offers a fully subcutaneous treatment option for moderately to severely active CD\u201d, adding that the approval makes it \u201cpossible to achieve meaningful improvements in clinical and endoscopic outcomes with the flexibility of self-administration from the start\u201d.\n\nTremfya is already approved in the US to treat ulcerative colitis, the other main type of IBD, as well as plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s latest decision on the drug was based on evidence from multiple phase 3 trials evaluating more than 1,300 patients with moderately to severely active CD who failed or were intolerant to conventional therapy or biologics.\n\nThis included results from late-stage GRAVITI programme, in which Tremfya was superior to J&J\u2019s Stelara (ustekinumab) across all pooled endoscopic endpoints.\n\nLead investigator of the phase 3 GRAVITI study Remo Panaccione, the University of Calgary, said: \u201cDespite the progress in the management of CD, many patients experience debilitating symptoms and are in need of new treatment options.\n\n\u201cThe approval of Tremfya offers an IL-23 inhibitor that has shown robust rates of endoscopic remission with both subcutaneous and intravenous induction regimens. Importantly, the fully subcutaneous regimen offers choice and flexibility for patients and providers that have not been available before.\u201d\n\nThe authorisation comes just two weeks after J&J\u2019s Lazcluze (lazertinib) was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency as part of a combination treatment for a subset of lung cancer patients.",

The stock's 50-day simple moving average crossed above its 200-day simple moving average, often seen as a sign of strengthening momentum.\n\nWhile the charts suggest optimism, Johnson & Johnson's latest breakthrough in lung cancer treatment could provide an additional catalyst for investors.\n\nChart created using Benzinga Pro\n\nJohnson & Johnson Stock: Bullish, But With Near-Term Hurdles\n\nAt $162.37, the Johnson & Johnson stock price shows signs of strength, but short-term moving averages present a mixed picture. The eight-day simple moving average at $163.37 and the 20-day simple moving average at $164.45 suggest slight selling pressure. However, the 50-day simple moving average at $156.24 and the 200-day simple moving average at $155.72 firmly support a bullish trend.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator at 1.74 reinforces the bullish outlook, while a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 52.33 indicates the stock is in neutral territory \u2014 not overbought or oversold.\n\nRead Also: FDA Grants Fast Track Review To Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Nipocalimab For Autoimmune Disorder That Affects Tears, Saliva\n\nCancer Breakthrough Could Fuel Long-Term Gains\n\nBeyond technicals, Johnson & Johnson announced a major milestone in lung cancer treatment.

The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

The company\u2019s strategic acquisitions and alliances are fostering long-term growth and consistently driving revenues. It expects net revenues to grow in low double-digits in fiscal 2025.\n\n\n\nVisa is fueled by persistent increases in payments, cross-border volumes and sustained investments in technology, and is witnessing significant profit growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.\n\n\n\nHowever, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. We expect the metric to rise 7.6% year over year in fiscal 2025. It is witnessing a volatile cash volume from the Asia Pacific and U.S. regions. Hence, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+13.4% vs. +7.7%). The company\u2019s Innovative Medicine unit is showing a growth trend, driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada and continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli.\n\n\n\nJ&J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and has been on an acquisition spree lately, which has strengthened its pipeline. J&J has also made strong progress toward resolving the talc litigation.\n\n\n\nHowever, sales in the MedTech segment have slowed down due to headwinds in Asia-Pacific markets like China and competitive pressure in some categories. The launch of Stelara generics is expected to significantly erode the drug\u2019s sales in 2025. The uncertainty around the talc lawsuits remains.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Johnson & Johnson here >>>)\n\n\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (-10.6% vs. -7.5%). Due to volatile macroeconomic conditions its operations can be dented. The continuous decline in COVID testing-related demand also adds to the worry. Nevertheless. Thermo Fisher is braving the ongoing tough economic conditions by utilizing the PPI Business System, resulting in strong financial performance.\n\n\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\u2019s growth strategy has been bolstered by several recent product launches, including a Thermo Scientific Iliad scanning transmission electron microscope and new additions to the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads platform in the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\nThermo Fisher\u2019s continuous efforts to prioritize its partnership with customers to drive innovation and improve patient care bode well. The Zacks analyst expects the company\u2019s revenues to witness a 7.3% CAGR during 2025-2027. Robust solvency is an added advantage.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of AMREP have underperformed the Zacks Real Estate - Development industry over the past year (-9.4% vs. -5.7%).

Read more\n\nA parade of people joined Brandon Graham on stage Tuesday afternoon at the NovaCare Complex for photos with the retiring Eagles defensive end and his two Lombardi Trophies.\n\nAt one point, Graham was flanked by Fletcher Cox and Lane Johnson, and there they were, the Eagles\u2019 first-round picks from 2010, 2012, and 2013, smiles on their faces. All three of them were crucial in winning one of those two trophies, and two of them, Graham and Johnson, helped secure the second one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn his way to the stage, Cox joked about not caring about what he wears anymore and not having to worry about his weight. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be fat anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nThe three players are all around the same age. Graham is 36, Cox and Johnson are 34 (Johnson turns 35 in May). But while Cox was ready to offer Graham some words of wisdom about life after the NFL, Johnson, a five-time All-Pro right tackle, apparently still has plenty of football ahead of him. Before last season, Johnson said he thought it was realistic to play two or three more seasons, which would have him calling it a career after the 2025 or 2026 seasons. On Monday, Johnson and the Eagles agreed to an extension that keeps him under contract through the 2027 season with the team that drafted him fourth overall in 2013.\n\nDoes he plan to fulfill the contract and play through 2027?\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Brandon Graham\u2019s retirement speech, annotated and explained\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s very possible,\u201d Johnson said Wednesday. \u201cI think when you get to this stage of your career, you take it year by year. Physically, I feel really good.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re about to turn 35, you tend to reflect a lot.\u201d\n\nJohnson didn\u2019t necessarily expect to be feeling this good at this stage. Two years ago, he thought his body was starting to break down. He had adductor surgery in his groin in February 2023. The game had taken its toll on Johnson, who has suffered multiple concussions and injuries to his ankles and knees, as well as mental health issues that kept him off the field for a stretch in 2021. But Johnson got through the next two seasons mostly healthy, and he doesn\u2019t want to think about stopping yet.\n\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m feeling good and feel I can contribute, I\u2019ll continue to play,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve really known. I love my football family. I\u2019m an only child. My brothers are here.\u201d\n\nOne fewer without Graham. With all due respect to kicker Jake Elliott, who isn\u2019t subject to the physical toll of the others, Johnson, now the longest-tenured Eagle, is the last nonspecialist standing from that 2017-18 Super Bowl team.\n\nJohnson has taken a liking to being the older guy in the locker room. He values his one-on-one time with younger players, he said. Jason Peters helped prepare Johnson for life in the NFL. He told Johnson about the city, the organization, and what he needed to focus on to be a great tackle in the league. Johnson eventually will do that for his successor, though this new contract extends that timeline a little bit.\n\n\u201cI think actions speak a lot louder than what words can,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI hope when I come in here every day, people see that I have a routine, that I\u2019m working, training, and hopefully I\u2019m elevating my teammates around me to get better and do the same thing.\u201d\n\nJohnson said he looks to older athletes like LeBron James and Cuban wrestler Mija\u00edn L\u00f3pez, who won a fifth Olympic gold medal at age 41, to know that he can still perform at a high level.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Brandon Graham\u2019s positivity will be his lasting legacy as an Eagles all-timer\n\n\u201cThere are people that are able to go past the barriers or perceived barriers,\u201d he said. \u201cI look to guys and athletes like that as inspiration, just to know that it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nNot that Johnson was ever going anywhere, but this contract all but solidifies that he\u2019ll finish his career in Philadelphia. Along with Elliott, he can become the first player to win three Super Bowls with the Eagles, and he will end his career with a strong case for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be an awesome experience,\u201d Johnson said of that possibility. \u201cI never wanted to go to another team. The Eagles have always been here for me, good and bad. They\u2019ve been pivotal for my development as a player and as a person off the field.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to play well throughout my middle to maybe my upper 30s. I love the challenge of being an older player and the routine you got to keep up with. I think that\u2019s what I love most about football, just the conflict and the constant trying to improve. I think the people that I\u2019m in the building with have a similar mindset. When you combine all these things, I think that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had success here the past 10 years and why they\u2019re going to have success long after I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\nFred Johnson joins Jaguars\n\nJohnson\u2019s backup, Fred Johnson, signed Wednesday with the Jacksonville Jaguars, ESPN reported.\n\nThe Eagles have internal options at backup swing tackle, including Darian Kinnard and Laekin Vakalahi.",

            "content": "experienced an 11% share price increase over the last quarter, coinciding with pivotal product-related milestones. The FDA's granting of Fast Track Designation for nipocalimab to treat Sjogren's disease marks a significant advancement, following its earlier Breakthrough Therapy Designation. This recognition could propel investor confidence, given the potential for accelerating therapeutic development addressing unmet needs. Additionally, Health Canada's approval for LAZCLUZE and the positive results from the ANTHEM-UC study contribute to the company's strengthened therapeutic portfolio. Despite broader market declines, with indices like the Dow Jones and Nasdaq experiencing downturns, Johnson & Johnson's recent regulatory wins and promising clinical data may anchor its investor appeal. The broader market trends include a minor 1.7% uptick over the past week and a 10% increase yearly, positioning JNJ's performance as a standout amid market challenges. This optimism reflects the company's resilience in achieving key development milestones, irrespective of broader economic uncertainties.\n\nNYSE:JNJ Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the last five years, Johnson & Johnson's total shareholder return reached 68.59%. This period featured regulatory and legal challenges but also significant advancements in product approvals and strategic maneuvers. Noteworthy is the January 2022 FDA approval for XARELTO\u00ae to treat pediatric venous thromboembolism, bolstering the company's pharmaceutical segment. Another key development was J&J's announcement in November 2021 about its plan to separate the Consumer Health division, signaling a business focus shift.\n\nThe fiscal landscape was marked by a large one-off $7.8 billion loss impacting the financial results to December 2024, yet J&J continued its tradition of dividend increases, exemplified by the early 2025 rise to $1.24 per share. Meanwhile, despite J&J's underperformance compared to the broader US market's 10% climb in the past year, the company's initiatives in pharmaceuticals and legal resolutions anchored the longer-term investor confidence in the firm's potential amidst industry challenges.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "Tuesday, March 18, 2025\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc. (V), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO), as well as a micro-cap stock AMREP Corpo. (AXR). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.\n\n\n\nYou can read today's AWS here >>> Housing Starts, Imports/Exports Better than Expected\n\n\n\nToday's Featured Research Reports\n\n\n\nVisa\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+17.3% vs. +14.3%). The company\u2019s strategic acquisitions and alliances are fostering long-term growth and consistently driving revenues. It expects net revenues to grow in low double-digits in fiscal 2025.\n\n\n\nVisa is fueled by persistent increases in payments, cross-border volumes and sustained investments in technology, and is witnessing significant profit growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.\n\n\n\nHowever, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. We expect the metric to rise 7.6% year over year in fiscal 2025. It is witnessing a volatile cash volume from the Asia Pacific and U.S. regions. Hence, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+13.4% vs. +7.7%). The company\u2019s Innovative Medicine unit is showing a growth trend, driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada and continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli.\n\n\n\nJ&J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and has been on an acquisition spree lately, which has strengthened its pipeline. J&J has also made strong progress toward resolving the talc litigation.\n\n\n\nHowever, sales in the MedTech segment have slowed down due to headwinds in Asia-Pacific markets like China and competitive pressure in some categories. The launch of Stelara generics is expected to significantly erode the drug\u2019s sales in 2025. The uncertainty around the talc lawsuits remains.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Johnson & Johnson here >>>)\n\n\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (-10.6% vs. -7.5%). Due to volatile macroeconomic conditions its operations can be dented. The continuous decline in COVID testing-related demand also adds to the worry. Nevertheless. Thermo Fisher is braving the ongoing tough economic conditions by utilizing the PPI Business System, resulting in strong financial performance.\n\n\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\u2019s growth strategy has been bolstered by several recent product launches, including a Thermo Scientific Iliad scanning transmission electron microscope and new additions to the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads platform in the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\nThermo Fisher\u2019s continuous efforts to prioritize its partnership with customers to drive innovation and improve patient care bode well. The Zacks analyst expects the company\u2019s revenues to witness a 7.3% CAGR during 2025-2027. Robust solvency is an added advantage.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of AMREP have underperformed the Zacks Real Estate - Development industry over the past year (-9.4% vs. -5.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $114.21 million has seen home sale margins fall to 20% for the nine months ended Jan. 31, 2024, from 27% for the nine months ended Jan. 31, 2025, due to rising construction costs. Elevated mortgage rates and affordability concerns may pressure future growth.\n\nAMREP faces risks from land sale concentration, project delays and declining investment asset sales, impacting growth sustainability. Nevertheless, AMREP's net income surged 246.5% to $8.8 million for the nine months ended Jan. 31, 2025, with earnings per diluted share rising from $0.48 to $1.64. Home sales revenue grew 93.3% to $18.4 million, supported by strong demand in New Mexico, with 101 homes in production.\n\n\n\nCash reserves increased to $36.9 million from $29.7 million as of April 30, 2024, while debt remains minimal at $29,000. Land sales rose 16.3% to $18.1 million, but third-quarter fiscal 2025 sales declined 27.9%.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on AMREP here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NextEra Energy, Inc.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson executives are scheduled to take the stand in a trial that started Monday.\n\nChemImage, a small biotech firm, sued the healthcare giant over a 2019 partnership that went south.\n\nJohnson & Johnson had signed a multibillion-dollar contract with the Pittsburgh-based company.\n\nIn 2019, Johnson & Johnson, hoping to compete in the growing surgical robotics field, signed a multibillion-dollar contract with a small biotech company called ChemImage.\n\nBased in Pittsburgh, ChemImage was pioneering AI-powered software that a surgeon could use to \"see\" and interpret what a robotic scalpel is doing. The images would help the surgeon form real-time assessments of damaged or cancerous tissue.\n\nOn Monday, these former partners \u2014 the small biotech company and the global healthcare giant \u2014 began facing off in federal court in Manhattan at a trial over a $1.5 billion breach of contract lawsuit ChemImage filed last spring.\n\nUS District Judge Jesse Furman, who is presiding over the weeklong bench trial, has trimmed the allowable damages. If ChemImage prevails, it could still win some $180 million in contract-termination penalties and other overdue payments.\n\nChemImage has also asked the judge to restore all patents and intellectual property it developed under its contract with Johnson & Johnson. This would let the plaintiffs resume developing and monetizing their imaging software.\n\n\"This is a case about J&J's decision to retreat from its failed play in surgical robotics, breaking the promises it made to ChemImage to develop its life-saving imaging technology,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\"J&J's decision ultimately killed this family-founded company and its technology that could have vastly improved surgical outcomes for millions of people.\"\n\nWhat's undisputed in the case is that two days after Christmas in 2019, ChemImage and the J&J subsidiary Ethicon entered into a 104-page \"Research, Development, License, and Commercialization Agreement.\"\n\nThe contract set a payment schedule \u2014 ChemImage received $7 million up front \u2014 and established milestones for future payments and as much as $1.5 billion in eventual royalties.\n\nAlso undisputed is that in April 2023 \u2014 with the effort to meld ChemImage's software and J&J's robotics mired in delay and no commercially viable product in sight \u2014 the contract blew up.\n\nThe judge is tasked with determining whether J&J pulled the contract for good reason \u2014 \"with cause.\" If so, ChemImage would be entitled to no damages at all.\n\nAlternately, if J&J pulled the contract for no valid reason \u2014 without cause \u2014 the healthcare company would have been required to give ChemImage a 120-day notice and a $40 million termination payment, neither of which happened.\n\nChemImage also alleges that an additional $140 million in incremental development \"milestone\" payments are due.\n\nMuch of the trial testimony will involve opposing accounts of why the partnership went south after three years.\n\nJ&J will present witnesses to show that the contract was terminated for cause, and so ChemImage does not deserve damages. In court papers, they allege that ChemImage failed to meet more than one developmental milestone after more than two years of work, and caused significant cost overruns.\n\n\"Plaintiff was harmed as a result of its own conduct,\" J&J's lawyers wrote in January.\n\nChemImage puts its founder on the stand\n\nOn Monday morning, ChemImage called the trial's first witness, Patrick Treado, who founded the imaging company in 1994. He testified that the imaging company was blindsided when reps of J&J subsidiary Ethicon announced two years ago that they were terminating the contract because development milestones had not been met.\n\n\"At no time were there concerns about the study designs that were not addressed,\" he said.\n\nEthicon had participated as partners every time its hardware was paired with ChemImage's AI-powered software in research surgeries on animals, Treado told the judge.\n\nThe surgeries were conducted in labs run by both ChemImage and J&J \"at great expense,\" Treado said during cross-examination, referring to what he described as the high cost of treating the test animals ethically by conducting \"non-survival surgeries.\"\n\n\"In my remarks, I indicated my opinion that there was no breach of the contract,\" he told the judge of a contentious April 7, 2023 meeting, during which J&J execs accused ChemImage of obscuring its failures through poor quality data.\n\nChemImage has said in court papers that development delays were caused by issues with J&J's own technology, employee turnover, and lack of engagement.\n\nNine current and former J&J executives are on the parties' witness lists, including Hani Abouhalka, the surgery chairman for the MedTech division, and Rocco De Bernardis, the global president of robotic and digital surgery. Peter Shen, the MedTech division's former global head of research, is also on the list.\n\nChemImage is also expected to call many of its own former executives, including its former CEO, Dr. Jeffrey Cohen, who, according to court documents, will be questioned about the imaging company's frequent requests to J&J for more funding and cash advances.\n\nCohen will testify that J&J \"knowingly and maliciously\" caused Ethicon to breach the contract, ChemImage's lawyers wrote in January.",

EDT / 1:30 P.M. CET\n\nPARIS and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO \u2013\u2013 NASDAQ: NBTX \u2013 the \u2018\u2018Company\u2019\u2019), a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive nanotherapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients, today announced the execution of another disciplined step in its financial strategy through the amendment of the Company\u2019s global licensing agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, a Johnson & Johnson company.\n\nThe amendment removes Nanobiotix\u2019s funding obligation for NANORAY-312 and releases Johnson & Johnson from select future potential milestone payments, while safeguarding Nanobiotix\u2019s path to sustainable cashflow through significant potential milestone payments.\n\nCore Components of the Amendment\n\nJohnson & Johnson to Cover NANORAY-312 Costs Through Completion: Johnson & Johnson will assume nearly all remaining costs for the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 trial through completion, less a small portion of costs that will remain covered by Nanobiotix.\n\n\n\nOverall Deal Value Adjusted from Approximately $2.7B to Approximately $2.6B : Revisions to potential future milestone payments in the amendment total $105M while maintaining first significant milestones and hundreds of millions in potential milestone payments related to the clinical programs for cisplatin-ineligible head and neck cancer and stage 3 unresectable non-small cell lung cancer expected by Nanobiotix in the coming years. The global licensing agreement, now valued up to approximately $2.6B , includes Nanobiotix eligibility for potential success-based payments that include: $1.77B , in the aggregate, in potential development, regulatory, and sales milestones related to the first programs including cisplatin-ineligible head and neck cancer and unresectable stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer. $650M , in the aggregate, in potential additional development, regulatory, and sales milestones related to five new indications that may be developed by Johnson & Johnson at its sole discretion. $165M , in the aggregate, in potential development, regulatory, and sales milestones for China, South Korea, Singapore, and Thailand. In addition to the approximately $2.6B in potential milestones outlined above, Nanobiotix remains eligible for $220M in potential development and regulatory milestones per new indication that may be developed by Nanobiotix, in alignment with Johnson & Johnson. Tiered double-digit potential royalties in the low 10s to low 20s remain unchanged.\n\nto Approximately :\n\nMeaningful Extension of Cash Runway and Reduction of Cash Burn: The amended agreement has enabled Nanobiotix to strengthen its financial position, extending cash visibility to mid-2026, while continuing to explore additional financing options\u2014preferably non-dilutive\u2014to further extend runway into 2027. Nanobiotix also expects a meaningful reduction of operational cash burn going forward, as the ongoing Phase 3 study previously represented a significant portion of the Company\u2019s operating costs.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur disciplined financial approach has provided an important step and continues our positive trend toward long-term stability and profitability,\u201d said Bart Van Rhijn, Nanobiotix Chief Financial and Business Officer. \u201cThe revised licensing terms with Johnson & Johnson ensure operational alignment given changes in NANORAY-312 responsibilities while preserving key milestone opportunities and extending Nanobiotix cash visibility into mid-2026. We are pleased by what we view as a favorable cost of capital resulting from this amendment. We are continuing to evaluate additional, preferably non-dilutive, financial solutions to further extend runway into 2027 and ensure our path to sustainable revenue through the hundreds of millions in potential milestone payments related to our lead programs expected in the coming years.\u201d\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nNanobiotix will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Tuesday, March 18, 2025, at 8:30 AM EDT / 1:30 PM CET, prior to the open of the U.S. market. During the call, Laurent Levy, chief executive officer, and Bart Van Rhijn, chief financial and business officer, will briefly review the amendment and its impact on the Company before taking questions from participants.\n\nRegistration and conference call link : click here\n\nDetails of the call are also available in the investors section of the Company\u2019s website at www.nanobiotix.com.

Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate\u2019s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy, subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA, Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nRadiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, including in NANORAY-312\u2014a global, randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy, with or without cetuximab, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy\u2014the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.\n\nGiven the Company\u2019s focus areas, and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3, Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy, in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad, comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023, Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, a Johnson & Johnson company.\n\nAbout NANOBIOTIX\n\nNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive, physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

Staff Video, USA TODAY\n\nAdam Johnson, also known as \"Podium Guy\" or \"Lectern Guy\" after stealing Nancy Pelosi's lectern during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, and recently pardoned by President Donald Trump, has filed an unrelated lawsuit against a Florida county.\n\nJohnson is suing Manatee County and six county commissioners for not collecting legal fees from former commissioner and The Bradenton Times publisher Joe McClash, stemming from a 2023 suit filed by McClash over repealed local wetlands protections.\n\nJohnson was arrested on Jan. 8, 2021, for his role in the Capitol breach and subsequent theft of Pelosi's lectern. He later entered a guilty plea to one misdemeanor count of entering or remaining in a restricted facility and was sentenced to 75 days imprisonment and a $5,000 fine.\n\nTrump pardoned more than 1,500 people charged in the attack, including Johnson, on Jan. 20, 2025, the day he took office.\n\nHere are 5 things to know about Adam Johnson and the Manatee County, Florida lawsuit:\n\n1. Who is Jan. 6 'Podium Guy' Adam Johnson?\n\nJohnson, 40, of Palmetto in Manatee County, Florida, went viral on social media as the \"Podium Guy\" after a photograph showed him grinning and carrying Nancy Pelosi's lectern during the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the Capitol building.\n\nHe was arrested two days later and charged with three felonies. Johnson later pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor charge and was sentenced to 75 days of imprisonment and a $5,000 fine.\n\nAt sentencing, Johnson told the judge that posing with the lectern was a \u201cvery stupid idea,\u201d the AP reported.\n\n\u201cI bear no ill will toward her or her office at all,\u201d Johnson said in court.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pardoned Johnson on Jan. 21, 2025.\n\n2. How was Adam Johnson caught in Florida after Jan. 6, 2021?\n\nAccording to previous Herald-Tribune reports, the FBI said Johnson illegally entered the Capitol building and removed Speaker Nancy Pelosi's lectern from where it had been stored on the House side of the building.\n\nHe was seen walking within the rotunda of the Capitol with the lectern.\n\nA search of open sources, including Getty Images, which took the viral photo, led law enforcement to Johnson.\n\nOn Jan. 6, an individual called the FBI\u2019s National Threat Operations Center to report that the man seen in the Getty Images photo was named Adam Johnson.\n\nThe caller claimed Johnson was a resident of Bradenton, and that he shared a mutual friend with Johnson.\n\nAn FBI inquiry on government databases revealed an individual named Adam Johnson associated with residences in two cities in Florida: Bradenton and Parrish.\n\nA search of the Florida Department of Motor Vehicles turned up Adam Johnson\u2019s license photograph. By comparing the image to the Getty Images photo, the FBI determined it was the same man.\n\nThe FBI consulted with members of Pelosi's staff and was told that before the forced entry, the lectern was stored in the Speaker\u2019s Suite under a staircase to the third floor on the House side of the Capitol building.\n\nThe lectern was found by a member of the Senate staff in the Red corridor of the Senate wing off the Rotunda in the Capitol building.\n\nJohnson was arrested and charged with three felonies:\n\nKnowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority\n\nTheft of government property\n\nViolent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds\n\nHe later pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of entering or remaining in a restricted facility.\n\n3. How did Adam Johnson react to Trump pardon?\n\nJohnson denied that he did anything wrong or that he was a part of efforts to storm the capital building, despite breaching a police perimeter and even calling on fellow rioters to use a bust of George Washington as a battering ram to open the doors to the House Chamber, according to documents from the United States District Court, according to previous Herald-Tribune reporting.\n\n\u201cIt was a misdemeanor trespassing charge. I don\u2019t understand why people are concerned about me being pardoned. This is a nothing burger,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been four years. I\u2019ve moved on. My life has gone on.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresidents pardon people all the time,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new thing\u2026they\u2019ve pardoned worse people before.\u201d\n\nJohnson said that he merely walked through the open doors, \u201cpeacefully\u201d assembled and protested within his First Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cI aired my grievances with the government, and I went home,\" he said.\n\n4. Where in Florida is 'Podium Guy' Adam Johnson from?\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Johnson was a resident of Parrish, Florida, an unincorporated community in northwestern Manatee County.\n\nHe now lives in Palmetto, about 12.5 miles southwest of Parrish.\n\nPalmetto is a waterfront community on the Gulf Coast of Florida, midway between Tampa/St. Petersburg to the north and Sarasota to the south, according to the city's website.\n\n5. What is Manatee County lawsuit brought by Adam Johnson about?\n\nJohnson claims that following the 2024 elections, Manatee County commissioners \"corruptly\" voted to benefit Joe McClash by not collecting attorney's fees related to a lawsuit he filed against a previous board for repealing all local wetlands protections \u2014 many of which were implemented during his tenure \u2014 that exceeded state-level policies, the Herald-Tribune reported.\n\nMcClash's lawsuit, filed in November 2023, was supported by many Manatee County residents who opposed the reduction of wetlands buffer requirements from 50 feet to 25 feet, the hiring of a consultant aligned with local developers, and spoke out on other issues like flooding during natural disasters \u2014 such as those later experienced during Hurricane Debby.\n\nJohnson claims that because of McClash's lawsuit dismissal, Manatee County is entitled to recover a combined $256,807.50 in attorney's fees and taxable costs related to the lawsuit under a 2023 Florida law aimed at decreasing frivolous lawsuits.\n\nHe requests the court grant an injunction against Manatee County and require that settlement fees associated with McClash's lawsuit are collected.\n\nCommissioners George Kruse, Tal Siddique, Carol Felts, and Rober McCann \"all received an endorsement from online publisher Joe McClash and in return they destroyed a public asset that solely benefitted Mr. McClash,\" Johnson said in a statement to the Herald-Tribune. \"Best case it\u2019s just bad optics, but in my opinion its corrupt political payback at the taxpayers\u2019 expense.\"\n\n\"Mr. McClash\u2019s frivolous and wasteful lawsuit against the county resulted in a judgment against him, owed to the taxpayers of Manatee County more than $250,000,\" he said. \"The taxpayers deserve their court-authorized collection.\"\n\nContributing: Melissa Pe\u0301rez-Carrillo, Gabriella Szymanowska, Sarasota Herald-Tribune; Savannah Berhmann, USA TODAY",

            "content": "Photo Credit: Fox\n\nIn Saturday\u2019s Big East Championship Game against Creighton, St. John\u2019s star RJ Luis Jr. stole the show with one of the best performances of his career on the biggest stage he has ever played on. But unfortunately, he was also involved in a bit of controversy that both Gus Johnson and Jim Jackson, who were on the call of the game, thought was a bit overblown.\n\nWith 8:42 left in the second half, Luis Jr. hit a three-point shot to extend St. John\u2019s lead to four points. But just moments later, he was issued a technical foul for a gesture he made with his hands as he celebrated getting back on defense.\n\nInitially, Johnson and Jackson didn\u2019t realize what had been called. But after quickly looking back at the play, both believed that the call was a bit of an overreaction.\n\n\u201cAh, he got a tech right there for what he did,\u201d said Jackson.\n\n\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d replied Johnson.\n\n\u201cWhen he came down and gave the signal after he made the three-point shot,\u201d added Jackson.\n\nRJ Luis Jr. received a technical foul for a gesture after the three pointer pic.twitter.com/9ZRbIrmArZ \u2014 FOX College Hoops (@CBBonFOX) March 16, 2025\n\nWhat the refs seemingly saw was Luis Jr. making what they believed to be a gun signal with his hands. Johnson and Jackson saw things differently, outlining how that exact same celebration is done by NBA players all the time.\n\n\u201cThe kids watch the NBA guys. The Knicks, Jalen Brunson does that after he hits every three,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the poll powered by Disqus.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, it\u2019s a gun sign,\u201d replied Jackson.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a gun, that\u2019s a three,\u201d said Johnson.\n\n\u201cI know, the kids do it a different way,\u201d added Jackson. \u201cI just\u2026 I don\u2019t like it. If he is actually parading and doing something, yes. But the signal itself, that\u2019s the three thing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly difficult to distinguish the difference between a gun sign and holding up three fingers the way that Luis Jr. did here. But as Johnson alluded to, why not issue Luis Jr. and the St. John\u2019s bench a warning when something like this happens instead of immediately jumping to a technical foul?\n\nTo issue a technical foul down the stretch of a competitive game with as much at stake as there was for both teams is obviously a bit premature in the eyes of both Johnson and Jackson. And, understandably, viewers largely concurred, ripping the officials for the call.\n\nAbsolutely embarrassing officiating \u2014 Adam Robert (@AdamBtweetin) March 16, 2025\n\n\u2026that\u2019s NOT a gun signal \ud83e\udd23 \u2014 Aaron (@_ayyDubs) March 16, 2025\n\nHorrific call \u2014 Adam Jones (@Jonesy_1989_) March 16, 2025\n\nFortunately, the call didn\u2019t cost St. John\u2019s all that much, as they would go on to win the game 82-66 en route to their first Big East Championship since 2000. But obviously, the questionable call very much would have been a talking point had St. John\u2019s gone on to lose the game.",

This was Trump's response to the very first question he faced with Martin in the Oval Office, before going on to lambast the European Union in general.Trump gave Miche\u00e1l Martin a warm welcome, then described the EU as an opponent of the US and accused Ireland of having the US pharmaceutical industry in its grip. Trump raised a \"massive\" trade imbalance with Ireland and accused the European Union of treating the US \"very badly\".Donald Trump added Ireland to the list of countries he says are taking advantage of his own as he welcomed Irish Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin to the White House. Trump has been engaging in war of words with US allies and adversaries alike over trade, slapping tariffs on imports from countries from Canada to China and beyond and creating major diplomatic rifts in the process.During an appearance with Martin in front of reporters, Trump repeated his claim that the European Union was created to take advantage of the US. Asked if Ireland was also taking advantage, Trump replied, \u201cof course they are\".\"I have great respect for Ireland and what they did and they should have done just what they did, but the United States shouldn\u2019t have let it happen,\" he complained.The 78-year-old president had a long list of grievances about the Emerald Isle. Trump said he had \"great respect\" for Ireland but in the same breath accused it of luring pharma and tech giants to its shores with low taxes.\"This is this beautiful island of five million people, it's got the entire US pharmaceutical industry in its grip,\" Trump said.The United States is Ireland's single biggest export market for pharmaceutical drugs and ingredients, mostly manufactured by American companies like Pfizer , Eli Lilly, and Johnson & Johnson.\"I'm not upset with you. I think I respect what you've done,\" said Trump. \"But the United States shouldn't have let it happen.\" The US president complained about \"tremendously bad\" treatment of tech titan Apple, which was ordered by Brussels to pay a multi-billion-euro tax settlement to Ireland.Trump finally returned to one of his favorite themes as he launched a broader attack on the 27-nation European Union. \"The EU was set up in order to take advantage of the United States,\" Trump said.Trump also doubled down on his threats to impose reciprocal tariffs on the European Union in April. \"So whatever they charge us, we're charging them.\"When Martin got a word in edgeways, he tried to strike a diplomatic tone. \"It's a two-way street,\" Martin said, adding that Ireland was stepping up investments in the United States.\"It's a relationship that we can develop and that will endure into the future.\" Trump agreed -- and then went back to speaking about the deficit.The Irish and US leaders also ended up talking past each other on the subject of the Israel-Hamas war. Non-NATO member Ireland is one of the most pro-Palestinian countries in Europe, in stark contrast to Trump who has called for the US to \"take over\" Gaza.\"It's been our view that a two-state solution is the ideal,\" Martin said.It was Trump's first Oval Office meeting with a foreign leader since his recent sit-down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which morphed into a shouting match as they jousted over ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The session ended with Zelenskyy being asked to leave the White House.Martin, who offered only gentle pushback to some of Trump's comments, returned to the White House in the evening and presented Trump with a bowl of shamrocks at an early St. Patrick's Day celebration. The duo also attended an annual luncheon at the Capitol.Former comedian Zelensky, at the White House to sign a deal on rare minerals and to keep Trump on side, kept things toned down as they sat in armchairs beside each other and fielded questions. Then, suddenly, things exploded.When Zelensky said that despite being an ocean away from Europe \"you will feel it in the future\" if you don't help Kyiv, Trump was incensed.\"Don't tell us what we are going to feel,\" Trump said, raising his voice. After that, the floodgates opened. \"You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to this country,\" Trump said.Red faced and furious, Trump wagged his finger at Zelensky as his voice rose higher. At one point he lightly shoved Zelensky's upper arm with his hand as he made his points. \"You're either going to make a deal or we're out,\" said Trump, making clear that this breach was real.Finally Trump called a halt and journalists were escorted out. An hour or so later, Zelensky abruptly left the White House and a minerals deal signing ceremony was canceled.(With inputs from AP)",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson executives are scheduled to take the stand in a trial starting Monday.\n\nChemImage, a small biotech firm, sued the healthcare giant over a 2019 partnership that went south.\n\nJohnson & Johnson had signed a multibillion-dollar contract with the Pittsburgh-based company.\n\nIn 2019, Johnson & Johnson, hoping to compete in the growing surgical robotics field, signed a multibillion-dollar contract with a small biotech company called ChemImage.\n\nBased in Pittsburgh, ChemImage was pioneering AI-powered software that a surgeon could use in order to \"see\" what a robotic scalpel is doing. The images would help the surgeon form real-time assessments of damaged or cancerous tissue.\n\nOn Monday, these former partners \u2014 the small biotech company and the global healthcare giant \u2014 are set to face off in federal court in Manhattan at a trial over a $1.5 billion breach of contract lawsuit ChemImage filed last spring.\n\nUS District Judge Jesse Furman, who will preside over the weeklong bench trial, has since trimmed the allowable damages. If ChemImage prevails, it could win some $180 million in contract-termination penalties and other overdue payments.\n\nChemImage has also asked the judge to restore all patents and intellectual property it developed under its contract with Johnson & Johnson. This would let the plaintiffs continue using and developing its imaging software.\n\n\"This is a case about J&J's decision to retreat from its failed play in surgical robotics, breaking the promises it made to ChemImage to develop its life-saving imaging technology,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\"J&J's decision ultimately killed this family-founded company and its technology that could have vastly improved surgical outcomes for millions of people.\"\n\nWhat's undisputed is that two days after Christmas in 2019, ChemImage and the J&J subsidiary Ethicon entered into a 104-page \"Research, Development, License, and Commercialization Agreement.\"\n\nThe contract set a payment schedule \u2014 ChemImage received $7 million up front \u2014 and established milestones for future payments and as much as $1.5 billion in eventual royalties.\n\nAlso undisputed is that in April 2023 \u2014 with the effort to meld ChemImage's software and J&J's robotics mired in delay and no commercially viable product in sight \u2014 the contract blew up.\n\nThe judge is tasked with determining whether J&J pulled the contract for good reason \u2014 \"with cause.\" If so, ChemImage would be entitled to no damages at all.\n\nAlternately, if J&J pulled the contract for no valid reason \u2014 without cause \u2014 the healthcare company would have been required to give ChemImage a 120-day notice and a $40 million termination payment, neither of which happened.\n\nChemImage also alleges that an additional $140 million in incremental development \"milestone\" payments are due.\n\nMuch of the testimony will involve opposing accounts of why the partnership went south after three years.\n\nJ&J will present witnesses to show that the contract was terminated for cause, and so ChemImage does not deserve damages. In court papers, they allege that ChemImage failed to meet more than one developmental milestone after more than two years of work, and caused significant cost overruns.\n\n\"Plaintiff was harmed as a result of its own conduct,\" J&J's lawyers wrote in January.\n\nChemImage counters in court papers that the delays were caused by issues with Ethicon's own technology, employee turnover, and lack of engagement.\n\nNine current and former J&J executives are on the parties' witness lists, including Hani Abouhalka, the surgery chairman for the MedTech division, and Rocco De Bernardis, the global president of robotic and digital surgery. Peter Shen, the MedTech division's former global head of research, is also on the list.\n\nChemImage is also expected to call many of its own former executives, including its former CEO, Dr. Jeffrey Cohen.",

(XNY/STAR MAX/IPx via AP) (XNY/STAR MAX/IPx)\n\nColleen Hoover\u2019s book Verity is being made into a movie \u2014 and it\u2019s going to be a killer.\n\nWhile the saga around the author\u2019s last film adaptation, It Ends With Us, continues to play out in lawsuits between actress Blake Lively and director Justin Baldoni, production on the psychological thriller Verity is underway in New York City with a star-studded cast.\n\nOn March 12, Dakota Johnson and Josh Hartnett, who play Lowen and Jeremy, respectively, were filming outside New York City\u2019s Grand Central Terminal. Photos showed Johnson covered with fake blood, which ran down her face onto her long overcoat and was smeared on her headphones.\n\nJohnson gets sprayed with fake blood on the set of Verity. (Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images via Getty Images) (GC Images)\n\nThe spatter was the result of a fatal pedestrian accident, which is the opening scene of Hoover\u2019s 2018 novel. The scene on set showed a cyclist on the hood of a car, Lowen being hit with the victim\u2019s blood and Jeremy sweeping in to help her.\n\nHartnett and Johnson shooting the opening scene of Hoover's book. (Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images via Getty Images) (GC Images)\n\nAnne Hathaway plays the title character \u2014 a famed thriller author who becomes incapacitated under suspicious circumstances \u2014 and was photographed shooting in Queens, N.Y., on March 10. The Oscar winner was wearing pink sweatpants and sneakers with a black blazer and sunglasses.\n\nVerity is being directed by Michael Showalter, who also helmed The Idea of You, released in 2024, starring Hathaway. The film \u2014 from Amazon MGM Studios \u2014 follows the box office success of It Ends With Us, which came out in August.\n\nHere\u2019s what else we know about it.\n\nWhat\u2019s the film about?\n\nBased on Hoover\u2019s New York Times bestseller, the dark psychosexual thriller tells the story of Lowen Ashleigh, a struggling writer who has a dream job fall into her lap. Jeremy Crawford, husband of thriller author Verity Crawford, hires Lowen to complete books that his wife couldn\u2019t after she was injured in a mysterious accident, according to Deadline.\n\nLowen goes to the couple\u2019s estate and finds Verity\u2019s unfinished autobiography manuscript \u2014 and it chillingly details the deaths of her twin daughters and other disturbing things. Lowen and Jeremy begin a relationship \u2014 while Verity is still alive. It\u2019s hard to know who, if any of them, you can trust.\n\nWho\u2019s making the film?\n\nJohnson, Hartnett and Hathaway make for a pretty impressive lead cast. Ismael Cruz Cord\u00f3va, Brady Wagner, Irina Dvorovenko, K.K. Moggie and Michael Abbott Jr. were recently added.\n\nIn February, Hartnett and Hathaway shot a scene on the streets of New York in happier times for their characters. They were decked out in formal attire and held hands.\n\nHathaway and Johnson are also producing the film along with Hoover and Showalter. The current script is written by Nick Antosca, according to Deadline.\n\nWhat has Hoover said about the film?\n\nThe author self-published Verity in 2018, and it became such a massive success that it was acquired by Grand Central Publishing in 2021. That year, she wrote on GoodReads that out of all her books, she \u201chad the most fun writing\u201d Verity.\n\nHoover at the It Ends With Us premiere on Aug. 6, 2024. (John Nacion/Variety via Getty Images) (John Nacion via Getty Images)\n\nIn August, Hoover said on Watch What Happens Live that she had just read the script and they were in the midst of casting. She had been sent a list of names but didn\u2019t divulge any of them. Brandon Sklenar, who starred in It Ends With Us, was on the show with her, and she said he would make a great Jeremy but couldn\u2019t put him in all of her films.\n\nWhen the casting of the three main characters was announced in December, Hoover wrote on Instagram, \u201cExcited is an understatement.\u201d\n\nVerity, self-published by Hoover in 2018, became a bestseller. (Grand Central Publishing)\n\nWhich other Hoover books are being adapted to film?\n\nRegretting You and Reminders of Him have been optioned for film adaptations.\n\nBaldoni\u2019s Wayfarer Studios bought the rights to It Starts With Us when it acquired It Ends With Us. The sequel is in an indefinite holding pattern due to the fallout between Lively and the studio.\n\nIn 2022, Hoover wrote on Goodreads: \u201cI did sell the film rights to Verity a while back, but that doesn't mean it will come to fruition. I've sold a lot of film rights that eventually reverted back to me if the producers couldn't get the project off the ground. I'm hoping this one works out, though! I think it would be fun to see Verity as a movie.\u201d\n\nAs for how she comes up with uncommon character names \u2014 Verity, Lowen, Atlas and Ryle \u2014 in her books, Hoover has said she \u201csteals names from readers\u201d when she does book signings.\n\n\u201cI always try to use unique names so when readers talk about the characters on social media, they aren't being confused with other characters from other books,\u201d she told Goodreads. \u201cI think it's important for authors to have names that stand out.\u201d\n\nHoover said she also gets her names from street signs and baby name websites.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with the \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 lawsuits?\n\nLively alleged in a complaint in December that she was subjected to sexual harassment by Baldoni on the set of It Ends With Us and was retaliated against when she spoke up. Baldoni denied the allegations and sued the New York Times for defamation over its story about an alleged smear campaign against Lively.\n\nLively sued Baldoni in December and he countersued in early January. A trial is set for 2026, and there have been a lot of allegations back and forth, which we are tracking in our live blog.",

            "content": "Anyone who knows me knows I always watch my morning news. So, I knew Candace Johnson\u2019s work before I knew Candace Johnson. For years, the West Philadelphia native was the producer behind Fox29\u2019s morning show (and other Fox series outside Philly), creating the same, successful formula Good Day Philadelphia still follows today. (She also worked on the set of Bad Boys II, where Willard Smith \u2014 Will\u2019s father \u2014 became her mentor.)\n\nLike when I was at Mitchell & Ness, Johnson\u2019s career filled up her life. All her innovation, those long hours took their toll. When she left the news in 2021, she needed a break. Once she stepped away, she found love \u2014 and, just hours after that, creative inspiration: The Touchy / Feely card game.\n\nShe tells the story this way:\n\n\n\nI was hanging out with a group of friends at a party. I met a guy, and he asked me if I wanted to hang out that night. I had a date with someone else that night, and so did he. We both canceled, went out with each other \u2014 and we ended up falling in love on that first date.\n\nThe evening was beautiful. It felt like an opera, a very romantic opera, the way the date laid out our conversation, the connectivity points. It was honest and true in every good way possible.\n\nAnd so when he left the next morning, I wasn\u2019t working. I had the morning. I felt calm \u2014 the way you feel the morning after you\u2019ve made love. And so with that energy, I wanted to create a project that gave the chemistry and the feeling of a good date experience when you get to walk away hopeful and reinvigorated and like and just giddy.\n\nEight hours later, Touchy / Feely, an intimacy card game, was done.\n\nTouchy / Feely has four levels of 20 questions each that you ask the person you\u2019re playing with. That person could be a new friend that you feel an instant connection with, or a lifelong partner, or even a youth (kids tend to master level one, Candace says). There\u2019s no winner or loser, only connections to make. Each question helps the players get to know each other better. The game\u2019s slogan is, \u201cEvery great conversation starts with a good question.\u201d\n\nOne year after Candace came up with it, Touchy / Feely was on the market. You can pick one up in select local boutique or online.\n\nI love the product, but I also love the story. It\u2019s proof you can reinvent yourself, be successful in more than one act. Candace says, \u201cI\u2019d been accomplished so early in life: I thought that was something to constantly run after \u2026 But then when you have everything, the question becomes: What does anything mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to create a project that gave the chemistry and the feeling of a good date, when you get to walk away hopeful and reinvigorated and just giddy,\u201d she says, \u201cthe UNO of intimacy.\u201d\n\nMORE FROM BIG RUBE\u2019S PHILLY\n\nCandace Johnson.

Ron Johnson of Wisconsin says Democrats will shoulder the blame if they don't produce votes to pass the spending bill.\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin said Democrats should broker a shorter term deal with bipartisan support.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 As Democrats grapple with whether to support a Republican measure to avert a government shutdown, Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin derided the proposal while her GOP counterpart said any shutdown would be the fault of her party.\n\nBaldwin on Wednesday referred to the Republican plan to avert a government shutdown, set for Friday night, as a \u201cslush fund\u201d for President Donald Trump, saying she would prefer a shorter-term, bipartisan funding patch.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ron Johnson, meanwhile, said any shutdown would fall on the shoulders of Democrats.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats decide to vote against this, they're the ones shutting down the government,\u201d Johnson told Newsmax. \u201cAnd they're the ones that should be paying the political price for doing so.\u201d\n\nSenate Democrats face a difficult decision after the House on a near party-line vote Tuesday passed a continuing resolution, or CR, that would fund the government through Sept. 30. The bill largely extends last year\u2019s level of spending but would increase defense spending by $6 billion while reducing non-defense spending by about $13 billion.\n\nCurrent federal funding expires at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, and 60 votes are needed to advance the resolution to continue the funding. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the chamber. Unlike regular appropriations bills, continuing resolutions do not include specific guidelines on how to spend the appropriated funds.\n\nSome Democrats have contended that helping to pass the measure would allow Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to continue his slashing of the federal government without consultation from Congress. Others have warned Democrats could take the brunt of the blame for a shutdown.\n\nMore: Already stretched thin, Wisconsin VA workers brace for impact of 80,000 U.S. layoffs\n\nBaldwin told the Journal Sentinel Wednesday that Democrats \u201cneed to figure out a way to force a vote on a short term CR to let us work in a bipartisan fashion.\u201d The House, however, adjourned for the week on Tuesday, leaving few other options before the shutdown deadline.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have a CR for the balance of the year, a slush fund for the President that was written by Speaker (Mike) Johnson,\u201d Baldwin said in a brief interview, though she did not explicitly say she would oppose the measure.\n\nJohnson, Wisconsin\u2019s GOP senator, at a WisPolitics.com event in Washington on Wednesday called the House-passed CR \u201cpretty darn clean.\u201d He said he and Republicans \u201cdon\u2019t like continuing resolutions. We don\u2019t like this level of spending. But I guess we hate government shutdowns even more. I\u2019ll support this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way they can blame Republicans,\u201d Johnson said, referencing the news media. \u201cIt\u2019ll be Democrats who shut the government down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how this plays out, but it is a ridiculous debate,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cFrom my standpoint, the dysfunction in government and in Washington, D.C., is profound, but 2025 is a lost cause.\u201d\n\nStill, the majority of Senate Democrats this week appeared unwilling to back the proposal. They largely framed their opposition as pushback against Trump and Musk\u2019s moves to dismantle the federal government.\n\nDelaware Sen. Chris Coons in a statement said the bill \u201cenables Trump\u2019s and Musk\u2019s devastating and unconstitutional cuts that have reduced our government\u2019s ability to protect public health and safety, made it harder for seniors to get their Social Security checks, and created an opening for China by dismantling our foreign aid partnerships.\"\n\n\u201cI think the Musk brigade is doing an enormous amount of damage to essential services like veterans and kids, and the like, and I am not going to be part of helping them in it,\u201d Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, told reporters Wednesday afternoon.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, said Republicans had an \u201cobligation\u201d to work with Democrats to come up with a \u201ccompromise product. And they refused to do that.\u201d He said the current bill was \u201cnot the right thing for the country.\u201d\n\nAsked about Democrats\u2019 strategy and pushback on Republican measures and the Trump administration, Murphy said: \u201cWhen we fight hard here, people fight harder around the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people notice when we take risks and when we stand up and fight for our values,\u201d Murphy told a group of reporters.\n\nUSA Today contributed to this report.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Was Jim Cramer Right About These 16 Stocks?. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago during his show on March 18, 2024.\n\nOn the most recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised his viewers against exiting the market entirely, despite the sharp sell-off. He also reminded viewers that, historically, the market has always found its bottom, and stocks can rebound over time. Cramer then addressed the idea of selling everything but he raised an important question saying:\n\n\u201cSure you can get out, but can you get back in? Selling everything right now feels great. We know that President Trump is now hanging with the bears\u2026 As he himself said you can\u2019t really watch the stock market, the stock market\u2019s the problems of the rich, and they don\u2019t matter as long as it, they can take a hit. And that\u2019s a zeitgeist from the Walmart White House where Trump\u2019s giving us everyday lower prices for stocks.\u201d\n\nCramer then pointed out the disparity between President Trump\u2019s approach and what long-term investors might believe is the right course of action. In the past, Cramer noted, figures like Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell were seen as stabilizers, or \u201cputs,\u201d that would help cushion the market\u2019s downward moves. However, no one seems to be talking about that kind of support lately. He added:\n\n\u201cPeople are capitulating because they want to get rid of the pain and they don\u2019t want to lose the game\u2026 See, there\u2019s just one problem. How do you get back in?\u201d\n\nCramer also highlighted a common pitfall: many investors get scared off during market downturns and fail to seize the opportunity to buy strong companies at lower prices. He pointed out that this fear leads people to miss out on significant future gains, leaving them on the sidelines while others take advantage of lower stock prices and reap substantial rewards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why you should be thinking of buying the great companies here, not selling them. To not get good merchandise as it starts being really cheap is a failure of imagination, to not have held them all the way could be a failure of recognition.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 16 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on March 18, 2024. We then calculated their performance from March 18th, 2024, market close to March 7th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\n\nNote: This article covers Jim Cramer\u2019s commentary from March 18, 2024, and does not account for any changes in his opinions regarding the stocks mentioned. Therefore, the commentary should not be mistaken for his latest opinions on any of the stocks that are mentioned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 98\n\nCramer had a bearish stance on Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) due to its legal overhang at the time. He strongly emphasized the reasons behind his decision to sell the stock. Despite believing in J&J\u2019s strong fundamentals, he argued that litigation risk made it uninvestable. Here\u2019s what he said back then:\n\n\u201cWe gave up on J&J at a small gain, mind you, because we were tired of being hostage to legal decisions that had little to do with the greatness of this storied company. What matters is that through this litigation, they were potentially on the hook for billions upon billions of dollars\u2014almost incalculable in losses.\u201d\n\nOne year later, the stock has been mostly flat, having gained just 2.26% since.\n\nIn more recent episodes, Cramer shared that Johnson & Johnson\u2019s shares tend to drive the entire sector up. Here are his latest comments from February 26:\n\n\u201cJNJ, which had just been, bedraggled down to 140s, has been a horse.\u201d\n\nOverall, JNJ ranks 16th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago. While we acknowledge the potential of JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JNJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson Faces Lawsuit Over Neutrogena Skin360 Service.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (J&J) is under fire in a proposed class action lawsuit over its Neutrogena Skin360 facial-scanning service. The lawsuit stems from claims that the company failed to properly inform users about the collection and use of their biometric data, specifically facial scans, which allegedly violates Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).\n\nWhat is Neutrogena Skin360?\n\nNeutrogena Skin360 is a technology that allows consumers to perform a personalized at-home skin assessment. By using their mobile devices to scan their faces, users receive detailed information about their skin health, along with recommendations for Neutrogena skincare products.\n\nThe technology relies on artificial intelligence (AI) to compare users' facial scans to a database of images, providing a customized skin health assessment. While convenient, the service has come under scrutiny for allegedly collecting and storing biometric data without proper disclosure.\n\nJudge Rules Against J&J's Healthcare Exemption Argument\n\nIn a court ruling on March 6, 2025, Federal Judge Michael A. Shipp dismissed J&J\u2019s defense that the Skin360 service should be exempt from BIPA due to its ties to healthcare. The company had argued that the service qualified under the healthcare exemption within BIPA, which applies to medical care provided by professionals.\n\nJudge Michael A. Shipp determined that Neutrogena Skin360 does not involve licensed medical professionals, making it a non-medical service under the law. The judge called the idea of categorizing the service as \"medical care\" a \"reach.\"\n\nPlaintiffs' Allegations: Privacy Violations and Lack of Consent\n\nThe plaintiffs, four Illinois residents, claim that when using the Skin360 app between 2020 and 2022, their biometric data\u2014including unique facial geometries\u2014was collected and stored without their consent.\n\nThey allege that J&J failed to inform them about the biometric data being captured, used, or shared. According to the lawsuit, this data was tied to personally identifiable information, such as names and birthdates, raising significant privacy concerns.\n\nThe Broader Impact of the Lawsuit on Biometric Data Use\n\nThe lawsuit is part of a broader trend focusing on the use of biometric data in consumer services. With growing concerns about data privacy, especially regarding sensitive information like facial scans, regulatory scrutiny on companies collecting such data is intensifying.\n\nIllinois' BIPA law is one of the strictest in the U.S., and this case could set a precedent for how other states approach the collection and use of biometric data. As companies continue to collect more sensitive data, ensuring transparency and obtaining clear consent from users will become increasingly important.\n\nWhat This Means for J&J and Consumer Privacy\n\nThe ruling against Johnson & Johnson over the Neutrogena Skin360 service marks an important moment in the ongoing debate over privacy, consumer rights, and biometric data. As more companies use AI and facial recognition technologies in their consumer products, it is likely that we will see more legal challenges and regulatory scrutiny on how companies handle biometric data.",

Sports Pulse\n\nFormer Detroit Lion and current Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford revealed former Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson had secret signals when they played together in Detroit.\n\nStafford threw to Johnson from 2009 to 2015 and the two became a powerful NFL offensive duo. In the 2011 season, Johnson led the league with 1,681 receiving yards and had 16 touchdown receptions, the second most that season, trailing only New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, who had 17. In 2012, Johnson set an NFL record with 1,964 receiving yards.\n\nStafford shared on the latest episode of Jason and Travis Kelce's \"New Heights\" podcast that he and Johnson had a cheat code.\n\nJohnson would use his hand to signal to Stafford whether he wanted a fade or glance route.\n\n\"He would just go open hand, closed hand on the inside hand,\" Stafford said. \"Closed hand was 'I'm running the fade.'\"\n\n\"It was crazy,\" Stafford continued.\n\nHe also shared his signature no-look pass started because everyone knew he was trying to throw Johnson the ball.\n\n\"So I was like, 'Alright, how do I get all these guys off my synth a little bit?' You know what I mean? And so I'm trying to move backers and when they're like just sending all the zone coverage right there and I'm trying to maneuver it. So, it kind of started then.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Like, alright. How do I still get this guy the ball? So, it obviously evolved into more tactical use of spreading it around a little bit, but I don't ever think about it. It just kind of happens organically.\"\n\nStafford also shared other details from his time in Detroit and return to the city as a Ram in the playoffs in January 2024.\n\n\"The playoff game was crazy,\" Stafford said.\n\n\"We ran out for pregame warmups and the the place was just packed and just booing the shit out of me, which is whatever,\" Stafford continued. \"But, yeah. That was a loud, loud game.\"\n\nThe Lions defeated the Rams, 24-23.\n\nStafford's appearance on the podcast comes shortly after agreeing to a one-year deal with the Ram to return for his 17th NFL season.\n\nYou can listen to the entire episode on Wondery, Apple or Spotify.",

Photo courtesy of SEEED.\n\nFounded in 2009, SEEED, which stands for Socially Equal Energy Efficient Development, is a nonprofit operating in East Knoxville, Tennessee. The organization\u2019s mission is to provide \u201cpathways out of poverty for young adults through career readiness training, environmental education and community engagement.\u201d\n\nIn February, Abby Hassler of Appalachian Voices spoke with SEEED\u2019s Executive Director and Founder Stan Johnson and Chief Operating Officer JD Jackson. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAbby Hassler: Our readers care deeply about investing in their communities and protecting their environment. For those unfamiliar with SEEED, what is your message to them about the work you all are doing?\n\nStan Johnson: We train inner-city young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 on green jobs. That\u2019s the gist of it. Those green jobs include environmental jobs as well as advocacy. We want to make sure that people are being able to knock on doors and talk to people about their utility bills. This environment did not get messed up in five minutes. We\u2019ve been dealing with this for a long time.\n\nI started out bashing the powers to be: the city, the county and the Knoxville Utilities Boards of the world, saying, \u201cY\u2019all ain\u2019t helping poor people. Y\u2019all ain\u2019t doing this. Y\u2019all ain\u2019t doing that. Blah, blah.\u201d But relationships are important.\n\nNow, most of those people are my partners. So, how do we teach people how to become good partners? I want to make sure that KUB and the city of Knoxville do well. But I want them to do it in a responsible way that considers the equity of others who are not as fortunate as they are. So that\u2019s where my passion is now: How do we make sure that we\u2019re socially equal?\n\nJD Jackson: Basically, it\u2019s pathways out of poverty. The future is holistic pathways out of poverty. You can give them a job or career, but what about their mental health, relationships and physical health?\n\nWe really dive into giving everyone the best chance to be the best person they can be. We have different avenues and partners. If you don\u2019t like what we do at SEEED as far as a job or career, we can get you into other careers. I don\u2019t want to be limited to what we can offer. We\u2019re going to offer them the best, give them the pathway towards it, and bring the community alongside them.\n\nHassler: What do you all love most about what you do?\n\nJohnson: It\u2019s the young people for me. I was the program director when I first started. I didn\u2019t know what an executive director was. I just wanted to be a mentor to these young people. That\u2019s where I get most of my energy and passion from. I started with three young men: Jerome Johnson, Joshua Outsey and Jarius Bus. All three of them were 21 years old. Now, they\u2019re all fathers and husbands taking care of their families. What more can you ask for? That\u2019s my passion.\n\nJackson: It\u2019s all about the young people. They\u2019re our future, and they need a voice. They need somebody to advocate for them. More importantly, they need somebody to meet them where they\u2019re at. You know, if you\u2019ve got a bucket and it\u2019s full of holes, before you pour something into it, you\u2019ve got to patch up the holes.\n\nSEEED\u2019s Career Readiness Training 2025 spring cohort at Alex Haley Heritage Square in Knoxville, Tenn. According to the nonprofit\u2019s 2024 Year in Review report, 28 students graduated the CRP last year. Following the completion of the CRP program, young adults can enter one of the nonprofit\u2019s bootcamps focused on green construction methods or community engagement. Photo courtesy of SEEED.\n\nHassler: Speaking of investing in young people, your foundational Career Readiness Program started a new cohort this month and runs for the next eight weeks. What do you have planned for these students, and what do you hope they will get out of the program?\n\nJackson: I want these young people to get a sense of authentic community within themselves. During the last two or three years, we started dealing with traumas, dramas and emotional scars. CRP Program Director Ronnisha Smith and CRP Coordinator Anise Banks are meeting these young people where they are and finding out what\u2019s going on first. If we can help them, we can, or if we\u2019ve got to get outside resources, we\u2019ll defer them or point them toward other organizations that can help them.\n\nBut for me, in particular, it\u2019s seeing the light come on, and they get it. The last two classes were filled with so many superstars who just wanted somebody to hear them and give them directions on where to go. You know, \u201cLet me pull the greatness inside of you and let you see it.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, I do have greatness in me.\u201d Okay, now take that greatness and do something with it.\n\nWe also tell them that they have to pay it forward, give it back and reinvest in the community so the whole community can thrive. It\u2019s that holistic approach to pathways out of poverty.\n\nHassler: Once students complete the CRP, they\u2019re eligible to enroll in one of your boot camps: Green Construction, Community Engagement and Edible Forest. Focusing on your Green Construction program, you all believe that \u201cnothing stops poverty like home ownership.\u201d You build energy-efficient homes and train CRP graduates in green construction skills. Tell me more about why you believe training young people for green jobs is important.\n\nJohnson: We\u2019ve got to save the damn planet. You know, we\u2019re kicking the can down the road. For instance, we did not have any housing standards until 1978. Guess when most of the houses in the \u201chood\u201d was built? If we\u2019re gonna fix that, weatherization has to happen. Who better to learn how to do weatherization than somebody who knows how to build a fully functioning zero-energy home?\n\nThe second part is that these young men, who are so amazing, had to pick their discipline before they went to the job site. The biggest thing is these young people get a chance to choose where their fertile ground is. We don\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019re good at math, so become a math teacher.\u201d We want to say, \u201cYou\u2019re good at this, but you love that. Here are some opportunities for you to go drive along or job shadow or look at it before you decide that this is what you want to do.\u201d\n\nFor example, this young man is now driving a concrete truck that weighs 80,000 pounds. That\u2019s because he went on a ride-along in the program and wanted to get his Commercial Driver\u2019s License to become a concrete truck driver. He would have never been able to think like that if he hadn\u2019t been exposed to these opportunities.\n\nJackson: We call it an extended job interview. As a matter of fact, on this last job, another of the boot campers got hired by the general contractor. He fell in love with this guy and wanted him on his team. So I said, \u201cGo out there, fly butterfly! Fly and be all that you can be.\u201d\n\nWe do something in the boot camp called \u201cHome Builders Institute\u201d training, where they can get on a pathway to certification. This guy said, \u201cI would like to come by and be the instructor for HBI.\u201d He\u2019s willing to circle back and help the other younger people because there\u2019s nothing better than a person that\u2019s close to your age saying, \u201cHey, look at me. I was part of the system. Now, I\u2019m coming back as a facilitator and teacher. Wow, if I could do it, you could do it.\u201d So they\u2019ll listen, and it becomes more attainable for them.\n\nSEEED has completed two energy-efficient homes equipped with solar panels in Knoxville, Tenn. The organization began its sustainable housing project program to create affordable, eco-friendly housing options for low-income families in the Knoxville region. Photo courtesy of SEEED.\n\nHassler: I would love to learn more about the energy-efficient homes these students are working on. In 2022, you unveiled your first energy-efficient solar home in Knoxville. You\u2019ve won some awards for that home and earned recognition from the Department of Energy. Any thoughts about that?\n\nJohnson: You know how you think you\u2019ve made it and arrived. Well, that made me know we had. The Department of Energy is not going to come to visit some little podunk nobodies. It took us from this little podunk mindset of, \u201cWe\u2019re just gonna make it along the way,\u201d to \u201cWe have won some awards for this house. We\u2019ve done some great work.\u201d All of this stuff is fantastic.\n\nWhen DOE came down and said they never see this much put into a home, that made me feel satisfied with the process. This has been 15, almost 16 years of work. These young people deserve it. The community deserves it.\n\nAt a ribbon-cutting ceremony, SEEED\u2019s CEO and Founder Stan Johnson hands over keys to the homeowner of the organization\u2019s second energy-efficient home on Fern Street in Knoxville, Tenn. Photo courtesy of SEEED.\n\nHassler: At the end of 2024, you handed over the keys to your second energy-efficient home and are gearing up to hand over the keys to your third this spring. These houses don\u2019t just feature solar panels and energy-efficient solutions, but you all also sell these homes below market value to low-income families for families to build generational wealth. What does this feel like?\n\nJackson: We are giving the best-built home to communities that normally have to settle for less. The family that moves into these houses, not only are they getting a leg up on generational wealth, but they also get the pride of home ownership. They\u2019re not renting anymore.\n\nNow, giving the keys to that first homeowner. Without this, they would have never, ever had the chance of homeownership. They were the only person in that family that ever owned a home. You want to talk about a first-time buyer; we\u2019re talking about a family where every member rents. It was transformative to them, and they were so great.\n\nWe gave these keys to this family. It\u2019s like the joy and a sense of relaxation and knowing, \u201cHey, we finally got a piece of the pie.\u201d It was bittersweet because about two months after that, the dad, who was the co-signer, passed away. But he had a chance to see his daughter get her own home.\n\nThe second home was the same thing \u2014 the first time someone in the family owned a home. We gave the keys to a family who were serial renters. We want to change these people into serial homeowners. That\u2019s our goal.\n\nWe have given people places and spaces they never thought they\u2019d be as far as owning their own homes. We\u2019re excited about this. What makes the third house more important is our partnership with UT-Battelle Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We\u2019ll be pushing the envelope to get a net-zero energy home.\n\nGroundbreaking ceremony at SEEED\u2019s \u201cNet-Zero Energy House of the Future.\u201d This project is made possible through a collaboration with UT-Battelle ORNL. Photo courtesy of SEEED.\n\nHassler: One of your more recent initiatives is the Sustainable Home Improvement Program, or SHIP. You partnered with the Solar and Energy Loan Fund, or SELF, to offer low-interest home improvement loans up to $25,000 with no minimum credit requirement. How did it get started, and what need is it serving?\n\nJackson: One reason SELF is doing this is because it\u2019s a pathway towards solar. I can\u2019t put a solar panel on the house with a bad roof. I can\u2019t put a solar panel on the house that needs weatherization. So, they fix the house and then get it ready for solar.\n\nWe are a Tennessee franchisee of SELF. The city of Knoxville, Knox County and KUB are our partners in this. They helped us start this franchise in Knoxville, and they\u2019ve been great partners.\n\nWe want to do energy retrofits to get homes ready for solar. We have done four projects so far, ranging from getting the windows fixed to HVAC to solar on someone\u2019s home. We really started about six or eight months ago, but it was a long build-up to it.\n\nJohnson: We realized there was this thing called the missing middle: The people who could afford to get their home weatherized and do solar were already doing it. Then, we had to educate the people that were low-income who could get this for free [Johnson is referencing the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s Home Uplift program, which provides an average of $10,000 in free home energy upgrades to income-eligible customers]. But for the people who were in the middle, there was nothing for them, so this loan program really is helping those people out.\n\nHassler: Is there anything you would like to add about how best to support organizations like SEEED right now?\n\nJohnson: We\u2019re in some different times. We\u2019re gonna need help from individual funders. If people believe what we\u2019re doing, this is definitely time for them to step up, right and start really pouring into organizations like SEEED that need the funding.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to be able to do it with the usual methods. We\u2019re going to have to double down, triple down and make sure that organizations make it through this terrible time.\n\nTo learn more about SEEED, visit https://www.seeedknox.org/.",

Dylan Suttles\n\nRose Gibson exemplifies the YWCA's mission by empowering women and girls, particularly those with disabilities. Over her 25-year career as the Vice Chairwoman of Challenge Unlimited Inc. and the Chairwoman of the Board for Residential Options and Project CU, Inc., she has dedicated herself to creating opportunities for individuals with disabilities to live, work, and actively engage in our community. Furthermore, she has successfully led initiatives that have empowered over 900 individuals, two-thirds of whom face disability challenges, to achieve their highest level of independence through meaningful long-term employment. Additionally, she has worked to educate companies and corporations about the benefits of providing long-term employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities, highlighting the positive impact on the entire community.\n\nHer dedication to building a better future for women with disabilities is evident through her support of programs specifically designed to meet their needs.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nGibson served as Co-Director for Junior Achievement in the Alton School District, where she played a role in empowering high school students with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively plan for their futures and make informed academic and economic choices. Her efforts in educating youth on how to start, run, and manage their own businesses fostered critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, production techniques, sales strategies, and leadership skills.

She has allocated more than $50,000 to financial education programs through schools, nonprofits, and employers.\n\nGibson's most significant achievement is her role in advancing opportunities for women in the historically male-dominated field of information technology (IT). When she joined Olin Corporation 40 years ago, she recognized that, as a woman, she needed to exert extra effort to maintain her position. With a strong commitment to merit, hard work, determination, and performance, she aimed to make a lasting impact regardless of her gender. Additionally, she understood the importance of challenging societal norms, and breaking barriers became a personal passion for her.

Johnson last year in May when authorities received a tip about him on the local Report a Drug Dealer website.\n\nThen, in June, a confidential informant told police that Johnson, 29, was dealing large amounts of pills from his residence on 3rd Street in Waynesboro.\n\nTwo days later that same month, on June 22, a repairman told police he found \"what he guessed to be $80,000 in cash\" hidden inside a vent in Johnson's HVAC system, along with a large bag of blue pills, according to an affidavit to a search warrant.\n\nPolice arrested Johnson that same day while serving the search warrant at his home. Waynesboro Chief Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Will Flory said $77,000 in cash was seized along with numerous pills.\n\n'They're awesome': Texas Roadhouse prepares to open. Get a look inside Waynesboro's newest restaurant\n\nWhile executing the warrant, as police entered the home they saw Johnson exiting a bathroom and heard a toilet flushing, Flory said. Police ran into the bathroom and scooped out a large amount of blue pills from the toilet, which they had to dislodge from the floor.\n\n\"Ultimately, they recovered 80 to a hundred fentanyl pills,\" Flory said.\n\nThe prosecutor also noted that at least 100 pieces of evidence were found on Johnson's cell phone, including a Cash App that he said showed more than $250,000 in transactions.\n\n\"This is somebody who had over $300,000 in illicit funds\" from drug transactions, Flory said.\n\nWest Augusta man pleads guilty to being an accessory after the fact in shooting\n\nLast week on March 7, Johnson pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of a Schedule I or II drug with intent to distribute, nixing a scheduled two-day jury trial. In a plea deal, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison with 10 suspended, giving him five years to serve. Johnson was also placed on two years of probation.\n\nJayla B. Tucker, 23, described as Johnson's girlfriend in the affidavit, pleaded guilty to possession of a Schedule I or II drug in connection with the case. She was given three months in jail.\n\nBoth Johnson and Tucker still face probation violations.\n\nIn 2017, Johnson was sentenced to seven years in prison on gun and drug charges following a police bust at a Waynesboro motel. His most recent arrest violated his probation in that case.\n\nIn 2015, Johnson was given two years in prison in Augusta County for being an accessory after the fact to a homicide. The charge stemmed from a 2014 slaying at a Fort Defiance party, where he helped the shooter flee the scene.\n\nDespite pleading guilty last week in Waynesboro, Johnson, who was represented by defense attorney Jonathan Simms, remains free. Flory said he will undergo leg surgery before being incarcerated. Johnson is scheduled to report to Middle River Regional Jail in Verona on May 2, and will eventually be transferred to the Virginia Department of Corrections to serve his sentence.\n\nMore: Staunton School Board, search firm meet to discuss timeline on hiring superintendent\n\nMore: Billy Opal relocates in downtown Staunton, planning grand opening celebration: BUSINESS BEAT\n\nBrad Zinn is the cops, courts and breaking news reporter at The News Leader.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 11 Stocks & Says Trump\u2019s \u2018Soft\u2019 On Tariffs Amidst $4 Trillion Wipeout. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to share his thoughts about the massive stock market crash on Monday. The tumble saw the flagship S&P index lose $4 trillion from its February peak to end up lower since President Trump\u2019s election win. Naturally, Cramer was full of thoughts about the President and how he might help markets. He started by outlining that the narrative surrounding tariffs could hurt President Trump, despite the fact that the US might very well need tariffs to balance the scales of global trade in its favor.\n\nCramer started out by sharing:\n\n\u201cBut, look let\u2019s just, we gotta come back to the President. You can\u2019t really watch the stock market when he said that tariffs are going to be the greatest thing we have ever done as a country. I call everyone\u2019s attention to the Washington Post piece this morning. Which says the base doesn\u2019t like tariffs. They\u2019re giving it thirty to thirty five percent people of the base who like tariffs. They have not been explained well.\u201d\n\nIn fact, despite the fact that the narrative surrounding tariffs has generated concerns about a recession, Cramer believes that the President is actually being too soft.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m looking at this and I\u2019m saying, and you know I support these tariffs, I\u2019m much harder on tariffs than he is,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think he [Trump] is being soft on tariffs. Because these, our partners, so-called partners have been ripping us up for ages. He\u2019s right about that,\u201d Cramer added.\n\nHowever, while the President might be right about tariffs, Cramer disagrees with him on the messaging. He believes that Trump\u2019s \u201cgotta be a little more like TR [Theodore Roosevelt]. You gotta speak softly and carry a big stick.\u201d On the flip side, the President\u2019s approach, which according to Cramer resembles \u201cspeak loud with no stick\u201d is \u201cwhat the bullies do.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC TV host also criticized Canada\u2019s approach in taking on Trump when it came to tariffs. \u201c[Y]ou don\u2019t want to do that. Now I wouldn\u2019t have done what Canada did, which is you know, fight back. You have to do it like Scheinbaum. But I just think that we\u2019re courting with a manufactured recession,\u201d he outlined.\n\nCramer cited former US Presidents and their approach to tariffs in his comments. President Trump repeatedly stated that he was a fan of President William McKinley, who held office from 1897 to 1901. However, Cramer believes that Trump should also consider Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s approach:\n\n\u201cIf the President were to be a little more like Theodore Roosevelt, little less like McKinley, by the way, who was really anti-working man, praising McKinley. . . I like these . But the President has to recognize that, maybe he should read the Washington Post, he probably doesn\u2019t like it. Or Citi [on] the pause in US exceptionalism today which thank you for doing nothing. But [inaudible] manufacturing recession, I guess it\u2019s the right time to do it. I think it\u2019s wrong. And when you come out and say there will be no recession, that\u2019s like 29, 30, when they were talking about don\u2019t worry about the. . .no, get away from that.\u201d\n\nAs to why Cramer wants President Trump to amplify his tariff strategy, here are the reasons:\n\n\u201cBeat these so called partners, by talking quietly and saying look, here\u2019s what awaits you if you don\u2019t lower. And then tell us. Like he doesn\u2019t explain why we\u2019re doing this. These countries have horrendous, I tried to buy a Deere tractor in Italy, like the tariff was like 50% on the. . .thing. There are thousands of tariffs against us. Have Peter Navarro, unemotionally, like he was when I was at Harvard, unemotionally, just explain what\u2019s really going on. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. He wrote Trump Time, that\u2019s a very good book. And it\u2019s very unemotional. I liked it a lot. But it\u2019s time for the President to be TR. A great president. Forget McKinley. Forget McKinley. That was like against William Jennings Brian, and he was like the cross of gold versus silver.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on March 11th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 98\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. It spent 2024 battling several headwinds, including a massive cancer lawsuit and regulations that targeted its products for Medicare benefits. In 2025, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\u2019s shares have gained 15% as the firm has benefited from market volatility. Investors prefer stocks like JNJ when they are uncertain about the future, as a stable and sizable business offers relief. Cramer\u2019s comments about Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) surrounded this theme:\n\n\u201cDavid Faber often asks me, what\u2019s the key to this market? I\u2019m gonna have to give three keys, I\u2019m sorry, lot of doers. SJ Smucker, SJM, Colgate, and JNJ. . . .JNJ has moved up mightily and it\u2019s right at the level where it can either break out or be repelled. Not sure about this. And, what I\u2019m saying is this these three have been bid up unnaturally by this program, which is out of the really good stocks of companies that are doing really well. And then to the companies, and I don\u2019t mean to slight JNJ, but it\u2019s been suboptimal. Well anyway, this is the breakout level for JNJ. If this market is going to bottom, JNJ has to be thrown back to the 160 level. . .Where they began these ascents. These companies are not doing well enough to be able to support the rallies that they\u2019ve had. It\u2019s entirely done by traders who don\u2019t seem to know how to trade by putting things on immediately. I wish I had worked these orders, you wouldn\u2019t see this action.\u201d \u201cAnd I have to tell you the one that has to, remember you need to see JNJ down, you need to see Smucker down, because that\u2019s where all the money went to. And that was ridiculous. That\u2019s just a program done, again, by incredibly sloppy traders who don\u2019t know how to trade.\u201d\n\nOverall, JNJ ranks 5th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "I recently spoke with Johnson & Johnson Executive Vice President and CIO Jim Swanson about the ways his company is deploying AI tools to help boost productivity and enhance core functions. Jim also spoke about the actions his team is taking to help cascade AI know-how across the organization and embed AI tools directly into staff workflows.\n\nMy conversation with Jim was the fourth installment in a series of interviews I\u2019ve been conducting with innovative CIOs at some of the world\u2019s top companies.\n\nAsheem Chandna: How are you using AI to drive improvement at J&J?\n\nJim Swanson: Today, technology is fundamental to how we deliver breakthroughs in our two sectors \u2013 Innovative Medicine and MedTech. AI tools are an important part of that technology solution set.\n\nWe have three main layers of AI deployment. The first layer is about improving productivity around our enterprise capabilities. The second layer is centered around enabling our end-to-end processes, whether it be drug discovery, clinical operations, getting a product to market, or engaging with customers. The third layer is about working to embed AI into the core of our products and services.\n\nCan you provide specific examples of how J&J is deploying AI tools to improve productivity?\n\nOne of the ways we\u2019re deploying AI is to help us to assess supply risks by product and detect supply risks before they can cause disruptions. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s a major fire that\u2019s creating issues with material suppliers. We need to know if that event will have any impact on our supplier manufacturing locations, materials, or products, so we can put contingency plans in place. We\u2019ve developed an AI-enabled platform that helps us predictively sense, monitor, and mitigate these types of risks. It gives us insights to quickly make decisions, leading to more resilient operations.\n\nAnother example is in our Global Services function. We now have AI-powered, automated agents that can answer employees\u2019 questions more directly. In the system that powers it, we\u2019ve ingested all the information employees might ask about \u2013 from benefits and time off to switching managers. When an employee calls or chats with our service desk, they get immediate responses to their questions and are sent links to relevant documents referenced in the call.\n\nGoing back to the second layer you\u2019d mentioned \u2013 how is J&J using AI to improve \u2018end-to-end capabilities?\n\nWe\u2019ve used AI tools for expediting and enhancing clinical trials, which are important for demonstrating safety and efficacy to regulatory and health authorities. If we are using sites that are slow to enroll patients, it takes much longer for us to get to the insights we need. So, we have started to use AI tools to improve our enrollment times. We\u2019ve seen an up to 2.6x increase in enrollment at the better performing, higher enrolling sites recommended through our AI models, which in turn is accelerating our time to insight.\n\nAs we operate all around the world and treat patients of every background, our clinical trial populations must also adequately reflect this diversity. But sometimes, we face difficulties in ensuring our trial pools are sufficiently sourced from the patient populations affected by the diseases we\u2019re aiming to treat. We are now applying AI models that allow us to better identify sites or patient segments to improve representation.\n\nThrough our biosignature platform, we are using AI-powered image analytics to better determine if a particular compound might have the potential to be a safe and effective medicine. AI allows us to make these determinations much faster than if we were to just wait for biological results. Our ability to use this treasure trove of information has helped us deliver novel molecular entities \u2013 or potential new drug candidates \u2013 faster than we would have been able to before embedding AI into our drug discovery processes.\n\nWe\u2019ve also taken all our curated, medically validated, legally reviewed content around our products and created an asset called AskJIA, which we are deploying to train our sales reps to improve their understanding of our products. Further, we\u2019ve consolidated all our provider interactions into a tool called Engagement.AI, which we are using to tailor insights to help inform healthcare providers as they consider treatment strategies for their patients in over 14 countries.\n\nCan you tell us more about how J&J is embedding AI into its core of products and services?\n\nWe are focused on use cases that matter and that allow us to continue to build our set of capabilities over time.\n\nFor example, with the issue of arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), we are using AI to help electrophysiologists determine which part of the heart should be targeted for ablation therapy, which is a procedure that can improve patient outcomes. In orthopedics, we\u2019re using AI to automate the analysis of patients\u2019 anatomy to help treat bony deformities of the foot and ankle. The software outputs a recommendation for the right instrument needed for the surgery and suggests a plan for correcting the deformity, simplifying the process for the surgeon.\n\nOn a practical level, how are you making sure AI tools are adopted and integrated throughout the organization?\n\nFirst, we have created two councils, an AI Council and a Data Management Council, which allow us to properly mature the technology stack and apply these tools to use cases that matter. These bodies help ensure we adhere to ethical standards and have a clear understanding of how to use these technologies in ways that are scalable.\n\nSecond, one of my core strategic pillars is to build the digital acumen of the entire company \u2013 in more than 130,000 employees. My basic thesis is that to fully benefit from these AI offerings, our people need to understand what they are, how they work and how they can be used to our advantage.\n\nWe\u2019ve created dedicated training curricula and coursework which provide employees an opportunity to experiment with AI tools. Across J&J, we\u2019ve seen more than 30,000 completions of courses in our \u201cdigital boot camp\u201d training, and 47,000 employees have taken a Generative AI course required anyone looking to use these tools.\n\nThird, we\u2019re placing a heavy emphasis on embedding AI tools directly into employees\u2019 workflows. For our sales representative, these capabilities are integrated directly into their CRM platform. When a representative prepares for a visit with a provider, they can get information on the kinds of patients the provider usually sees, the interactions we\u2019ve had with them previously, the types of advances or insights they might want to know about, the channel the provider prefers to be engaged on, etc. Similarly, with our drug safety teams, we have embedded these tools into their workflows so they can better identify and resolve cases.\n\nTo what extent are Gen AI tools cascaded across J&J?\n\nOver the past two years, much of our Gen AI work was in proofs of concept and pilots; we were more focused on learning. But now we are at the point where we are deploying Gen AI to our benefit.\n\nWe created a group to review the nearly 900 Gen AI use cases across our organization and flag any ethical, regulatory or compliance risks. Through this process, we\u2019ve been able to focus our efforts onto the highest impact, most scalable initiatives. In fact, we just launched a Gen AI-powered tool in our quality control space.\n\nWhen service representatives get a call from a customer about a particular product, they must very quickly determine if the product is ours, where it is located, whether it has been implemented in a specific patient area, what regulations apply to it and how we as an organization should be responding.\n\nBecause we do business in 150 countries around the world and serve millions of patients, we have hundreds of thousands of SKUs, making it difficult for representatives to rapidly make these decisions. But now, reps can quickly access all our product information and history instantly. Our team members can go from weeks of researching these questions to answering them in just minutes.\n\nAre you leading all these AI initiatives yourself, or do you also collaborate with startups?\n\nWe do not try to do everything ourselves. We understand there are more players outside our organization than within it, which is why we work with both large and small partners within the broader ecosystem.\n\nSmaller AI startups can sometimes have disruptive approaches to the types of problems we are trying to solve, but they do not always have the same volume of data that we have. If a startup is operating in a truly novel area, we invite them in, run through proofs of concept, and determine scalability. If we decide the project is a good fit, we\u2019ll pursue the partnership further; if not, we both walk away having learned something in the process.\n\nData is an area in which we sometimes partner with larger organizations, especially if we share a common goal \u2013 like finding new biomarkers or targets, strengthening real world evidence or improving drug safety and surveillance.\n\nOur approach is centered on identifying value and partnering with whoever can help us achieve our objectives. When things don\u2019t work out in a partnership, we try our best to apply lessons learned to the next set of collaborators.\n\nWith all these AI programs underway, you must have security concerns. What protocols is J&J putting in place to combat the growing risks associated with these types of threats?\n\nAs an organization, we watch out for all types of risks, which is why we spend so much time on governance. We don\u2019t view this as an afterthought \u2013 it is part of how we think and embedded up front in our approach.\n\nTo defend against threats, we\u2019ve created secure enclaves within the company for our large and small language models, and use vetted, curated data. Additionally, we created policies that educate our employees on the risks and restrictions around use of public Gen AI and direct them towards use of our internal generative AI application. We also review every proposed Gen AI use case through a process that includes security and architecture experts.\n\nHow does quantum computing fit into your future?\n\nWe are taking this emerging technology and trying to apply it to our specific business objectives, like enhancing and expediting our protein folding capabilities.\n\nToday, it is really difficult to understand how proteins fold and find molecules that will match to them. There is a whole set of chemical types we cannot even go after yet because we do not yet understand these underlying relationships.\n\nIf we can use quantum computing to think about folding in a different way, we could potentially unlock more chemical structures worth pursuing. To do this, we will need to work with third parties in the quantum computing space who understand both the sciences and our goals and objectives.\n\nThinking broadly, how else would you like to see AI or Gen AI technologies deployed in the coming years?\n\nAs the use of AI models increases, organizations will face greater challenges in the areas of data movement, costs, copyright and intellectual property. Therefore, within our company, I would most like to see improved observability to help mitigate threats in these areas.\n\nThere are also evolutions coming surrounding the types of data being used within these models. Today, we don\u2019t create our own large language models, but maybe down the road, if it gets really cost effective, we could. We do use small language models as well, and for both types, there is a heavy focus on prompt engineering and data curation to improve the efficacy of these models. I expect these capabilities to also evolve over time.\n\nFor us, it all comes down to outcomes. How can this technology benefit the patients and healthcare providers we serve around the world? When we pair amazing science with amazing technology, we can truly reimagine healthcare.",

Additionally, pivotal product developments like positive findings from the ANTHEM-UC Phase 2b study for ulcerative colitis and an FDA approval for SPRAVATO as a monotherapy for major depressive disorder contributed to boosting investor sentiment. These developments occurred amidst a broader market environment that has experienced fluctuations, with the S&P 500 dropping 9% from its record high, largely influenced by economic uncertainties, including potential tariff impacts under the current administration.\n\nAssess the potential risks impacting Johnson & Johnson's growth trajectory\u2014explore our risk evaluation report.\n\nNYSE:JNJ Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nSearching for a Fresh Perspective? Find companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value.\n\nOver the past five years, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) achieved a total shareholder return of 38.84%, highlighting the company's resilience despite challenges. This period has been marked by both significant developments and hurdles. JNJ's share performance can be partially attributed to product advancements such as the FDA approval of XARELTO for pediatric use in 2021 and ongoing innovations in treatments for conditions like ulcerative colitis and lung cancer. However, legal setbacks, including the US$8.9 billion talcum powder litigation settlement in October 2024, posed considerable challenges.\n\nThroughout this time, JNJ consistently maintained its dividend policy, enhancing shareholder value each year, exemplified by the 4.2% dividend increase in April 2024. Despite underperforming the US market over the past year, JNJ outpaced its pharmaceuticals industry peers, highlighting its durable market position. Leadership transitions, such as the CEO change to Joaquin Duato in January 2022, underscored JNJ's commitment to effective management and long-term strategy, further solidifying investor confidence.\n\nIs Johnson & Johnson part of your asset mix?

            "content": "'It is all love' when Akron's Seth Wilson, BG's Marcus Johnson meet in MAC Tournament\n\nCLEVELAND \u2014 Former St. Vincent-St. Mary teammates Seth Wilson and Marcus Johnson reconnected Thursday morning in the Mid-American Conference Men's Basketball Tournament at Rocket Arena.\n\nThe setting was a MAC quarterfinal between Wilson and top-seeded Akron and Johnson and No. 8 Bowling Green.\n\nThe game turned into a blowout as Akron (26-6) looked every bit the part of the MAC regular season champion and the reigning MAC Tournament champion in a 96-67 win over Bowling Green (14-18) to advance to a semifinal against Toledo on Friday.\n\nBoth players started and each made 5 of 7 shots from beyond the 3-point arc.\n\nJohnson, a 6-foot-7 and 265-pound senior, scored a game-high 23 points and also had seven rebounds, six turnovers, two assists, one steal and one block in just over 36 minutes.\n\nWilson, who is a 6-2 and 220-pound senior, finished with 15 points, two steals, two assists, two turnovers in just over 24 minutes.\n\n\"It was great to compete against him,\" Wilson said. \"To be high school teammates and to see each other on this stage at the highest level, it is a testament to each of us as far as work and trusting the process. To see us both out here and perform well, regardless of the outcome, was huge.\"\n\nJohnson played all four of his high school seasons at STVM form 2016-2020. He was a reserve on STVM's 2017 and 2018 teams that won Division II state championships and was a reserve on the 2019 team that finished as the Division I state runner-up.\n\nSTVM won a Division II district title during Johnson's senior season in 2020, but the rest of the season was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWilson played two seasons apiece at STVM (2017-2019) and Lorain (2019-2021). He started on STVM's 2018 team that won the Division II state championship and on the 2019 team that finished as the Division I state runner-up.\n\n\"When we see each other, it is all love and reminiscing because we won a ring together,\" Wilson said. \"Naturally, we reminisce about the good times, and when we are on the court we try to push each other to be the best.\"\n\nJohnson played at Spire Institute, Parkland College and Wheeling before transferring to Bowling Green before this season.\n\nWilson played the past three seasons at West Virginia before transferring to Akron.\n\n\"I thought Johnson was terrific with his shot making, unlimited range, high release with size,\" Akron coach John Groce said. \"I thought a couple times we did a poor job of getting to him, but give him credit \u2014 you got to make 'em, right? And he did today and I think he did efficiently \u2014 23 points on 17 shots [from the field].\n\n\"I thought he was a tough cover, 5 for 7 for 3 ironically, and so was Seth. Seth made big shots and big plays for us. He's done that all year. Seth's a great, what I call connectivity guy. He helps connect our team. He's always in a good mood. He gives you the same attitude and effort every single day. He keeps our guys loose. He's got some Ric Flair \u2014 you have to ask him \u2014 chant that he likes to use with the guys. That's comical. And so he's really in a good spot right now.\n\n\"I'm happy for him because early on when the season started, we're trying to figure out a rotation with all these guys. He got a DNP and didn't play, and at that point in time, obviously when you do that as a coach, you're saying to the player like, 'Hey, this is the rotation we're going with tonight and you're not going to be in that rotation tonight.'\n\n\"He did not pout. He just kept playing. He was about the team and he earned the right to be where he is at right now in terms of his starting position, and the value that he adds at both ends of the floor is tremendous. It's ... a great story of my old college coach, I don't think it's a word, but called it sticktoitiveness, and that's what he did. So, I'm happy for Seth.\"\n\nAkron fire away from 3-point range to top Bowling Green\n\nWilson certainly had the better supporting cast Thursday as Akron guard Bowen Hardman scored a team-high 17 points off the bench for Akron. The Zips had five other players score in double-digits \u2014 Wilson (15), Tavari Johnson (14), Shammah Scott (14), Sharron Young (12) and Isaiah Gray (11).\n\nAkron had 21 assists on 34 field goals, including 16 from 3-point range. BG had eight assists on 25 field goals, including all five 3s by Marcus Johnson.\n\n\"We played well,\" Wilson said. \"We definitely shared the ball and defensively we were in tune. I feel like that definitely was a strong point in us winning today, along with playing hard and playing for one another. That was a major thing, too.\"\n\nWilson also enjoyed playing on the Cleveland Cavaliers' home court for the second time after playing for West Virginia against Ohio State in a game on Dec. 30, 2023, won 78-75 in overtime by Buckeyes.\n\n\"It is amazing getting to play here,\" Wilson said. \"Naturally as a kid, you grow up wanting to play on the Cavs floor. To do that and be out there is a surreal moment. I am just blessed and grateful to be here.\"\n\nMichael Beaven can be reached by email at mbeaven@thebeaconjournal.com and is on Twitter at @MBeavenABJ.",

            "content": "Within dividend investing, companies with a consistent track record of dividend growth tend to attract greater investor interest. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted that firms with ample cash reserves are better positioned to sustain and expand their operations while continuing to pay stable or increasing dividends. To assess the sustainability of dividends, companies must evaluate whether their payouts are supported by cash generated from operating activities and the availability of free cash flow. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures\u2014such as spending on property, plants, and equipment (PP&E)\u2014from cash flow generated through operations. Excess cash can be allocated toward dividends, debt reduction, share buybacks, or business expansion.\n\nThe significance of dividend stocks is well established, with extensive research examining their long-term performance. A study by Robert Arnott found that over a period of more than 200 years, ending in 2002, the US stock market delivered an average annualized total return of 7.9%, with dividend reinvestment accounting for 5% of that growth. Beyond enhancing overall returns, dividends also provide a buffer during market downturns. Various studies have shown that companies paying dividends tend to experience lower downside risk and recover losses more quickly, ultimately leading to higher risk-adjusted returns over extended investment periods.\n\nThe Dobermans of the Dow strategy serves as an alternative to the well-known Dogs of the Dow approach, offering a more selective screening process. While the Dogs of the Dow ranks stocks solely based on dividend yield, the Dobermans method prioritizes high-quality companies trading at attractive valuations. The selection process involves two key steps: first, the 30 stocks in the Dow are ranked by Return on Equity (ROE), with the top 20 retained. Then, these 20 companies are further ranked by Free Cash Flow Yield, narrowing the selection to the final ten stocks, which form the Dobermans portfolio. Historically, a hypothetical portfolio following this approach and rebalanced annually has delivered superior performance compared to the Dow, the broader market, and the Dogs of the Dow strategy, according to a report by Forbes. The report further mentioned that since 2000, this methodology has generated a cumulative return of 810%, more than doubling the long-term performance of these benchmarks.\n\nWe recently published a list of Dobermans of the Dow: 10 Stocks to Consider . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other Dobermans of the Dow to buy.\n\nStory Continues\n\nA positive or growing free cash flow often signals stable or increasing profitability. Since strong free cash flow may indicate a healthy balance sheet, S&P Dow Jones conducted an analysis to determine whether free cash flow yield\u2014measured as annual free cash flow per share divided by stock price\u2014provides valuable insights into investment returns. The underlying investment thesis suggested that all else being equal, companies with a higher free cash flow yield are preferable, as they generate greater free cash income for each dollar invested.\n\nAn analysis of the broader market universe, divided into quintiles based on free cash flow yield, revealed that the top-quintile stocks delivered an annualized return of 15.7% between December 1990 and June 2017. This performance exceeded the returns of all other quintiles and outpaced the broader market by an average of 3.6%. While the bottom two quintiles also achieved respectable returns of 11.0% and 8.6% annually, respectively, both underperformed relative to the overall equity market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we filtered the Dow stocks by Return on Equity, narrowing the list to the top 20. These are then ranked by Free Cash Flow Yield, with the top 10 earning the title \u201cDobermans of the Dow.\u201d The stocks are ranked according to their free cash flow yield. In cases where multiple stocks had the same free cash flow yield, the number of hedge fund investors was used as a deciding factor. Data on hedge funds was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database, which tracks over 1,000 hedge funds as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ): Among Dobermans of the Dow to Buy\n\nA smiling baby with an array of baby care products in the foreground.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nFree Cash Flow Yield: 0.04\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 98\n\nAn American pharmaceutical company, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) ranks eighth on our list of the Dobermans of the Dow. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 4% and has returned over 16% since the start of 2025. Over the past 15 years, the company has strengthened its market position by shifting its focus toward brand-name drug development. Since spinning off its consumer health business, Kenvue, in 2023, its innovative medicine segment now generates nearly two-thirds of total revenue. While brand-name drugs have a limited period of market exclusivity, their strong pricing power and high margins remain key profitability drivers.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported revenue of $22.5 billion, marking a 5.2% increase from the previous year. As a major player in the healthcare industry, the company continues to focus on addressing critical medical needs, including multiple myeloma, lung cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and heart failure.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s (NYSE:JNJ) MedTech division recorded 6.2% operational sales growth worldwide, with acquisitions and divestitures contributing 1.5% to this increase. The Cardiovascular segment benefited from strong demand for electrophysiology products and Abiomed, while higher sales of wound closure products supported growth in the General Surgery division.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) offers a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share for a dividend yield of 2.96%, as of March 10. The company has one of the strongest dividend policies in the market as it has raised its payouts for 62 consecutive years.\n\nOverall, JNJ ranks 8th on our list of Dobermans of the Dow to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JNJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

Johnson & Johnson MedTech submitted this technology to the FDA for 510(k) clearance last fall.\n\nMonarch, the first robotic-assisted bronchoscopy system to market, offers minimally invasive access to and visualization of airways. It helps clinicians biopsy suspicious lung nodules. The platform helps deliver early, definitive diagnoses in lung cancer cases to get patients on the treatment pathway faster.\n\n[For more on the wide world of surgical robotics, see our special report on the space.]\n\nThe Monarch Quest platform builds on the system\u2019s stable reach and precision with a unique scope-in-sheath design and continuous vision, according to J&J MedTech. This software also integrates enhanced navigation with intraprocedural 3D imaging data, potentially improving accuracy in targeting lung nodules.\n\nAdditionally, Monarch Quest\u2019s AI-powered navigation leverages the full-stack Nvidia accelerated computing platform. This increases its real-time computational power by 260%, allowing it to run complex algorithms to enhance accuracy and confidence. The company struck a deal with Nvidia around using AI in surgical robotics about a year ago.

Wolk\u2019s pay included a $1.2 million salary, stock awards of $5.8 million, option awards of $2.6 million, cash bonuses of $1.8 million, a $1.1 million change in pension value and non-qualified deferred compensation earnings, and other compensation of $98,624.\n\nJ&J EVP and MedTech Worldwide Chair Tim Schmid was paid $11.9 million in 2024, including a salary of $896,308, $3 million in stock awards, option awards of $1.4 million, cash bonuses of $1.4 million, and a $1.1 million change in pension value and non-qualified deferred compensation earnings.\n\nSchmid \u2014 the former group chair of J&J MedTech Asia Pacific who replaced Ashley McEvoy as leader of the medtech business in 2023 \u2014 also received nearly $4.1 million in other compensation, mostly for costs to move from Singapore to the U.S.\n\nThat other compensation included $3.8 million in tax assistance related to his move to the U.S., with J&J saying Schmid was \u201ctaxed on the full value of all of his outstanding unvested options, RSU, and PSU awards, as well as his unexercised options that had already vested\u201d when he left Singapore.\n\nJ&J disclosed an additional $198,649 for relocation expenses, which J&J described as \u201cour standard international executive relocation package, which included airfare between Singapore and the company\u2019s offices, a corporate apartment, dependent tuition, and relocation expenses.\u201d\n\nJ&J did not disclose Schmid\u2019s pay for 2023, but said his base salary increased from $900,000 in 2024 to $950,000 in 2025.\n\nJ&J EVP and Innovative Medicine Worldwide Chair Jennifer Taubert received $11.2 million in total compensation for 2024, down 2% from $11 million the year before. Taubert\u2019s 2024 compensation included a $1.2 million salary, stock awards of $4.7 million, option awards of $2.1 million, cash bonuses of $1.9 million, a $1.2 million change in pension value and non-qualified deferred compensation earnings, and other compensation of $62,568.\n\nJ&J EVP of Innovative Medicine and R&D Dr. John Reed received $9.3 million in total compensation, down 55% from $20.6 million the year before (which included a $5.7 million signing bonus and stock awards of $11.7 million).

Specifically, whether they achieved the results consistent with the values embodied in Our Credo.\u201d\n\nJohnson & Johnson median worker pay and CEO pay ratio\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires publicly traded companies like J&J to calculate the gap between CEO compensation and pay for its median employee.\n\nJ&J estimated its median employee wage at $83,000, down from $84,000 the year before. J&J said part of that decline was due to the \u201cnet effect of changes in currency exchange rates,\u201d and without those changes, the median pay would have been $87,000.\n\nThat median wage and Duato\u2019s $24.3 million pay package puts J&J\u2019s CEO pay at 293 times more than the median worker, compared to a 338:1 ratio the year before.\n\nJ&J said that ratio is likely a conservative estimate and that the true pay gap between the CEO and median worker may be narrower.\n\nAt other medtech companies that offer more details about their median workers than required by the SEC pay disclosure rules, those median medtech workers often hold technical roles such as device design or engineering.\n\nMore medtech compensation analysis for CEOs, top-paid executives and median workers",

Two weeks ago, the men's and women's team continued their dominance in the BIG EAST, with both programs winning their fourth indoor championship in a row. Thirty-seven Huskies were named to the all-BIG EAST team, with strong performances across the board. This weekend, two Huskies will continue their standout individual seasons at the NCAA Indoor Track & Field Championships at Virginia Beach.\n\nMarc Morrison (Orlando, Fla.) and Kyle Johnson (Montverde, Fla.) have both made history for UConn this season. In his senior season, Morrison has shined in the long jump, setting a program record in the event with an impressive performance of 7.86m at the Penn 10 Elite Meet in January that pushed him to the NCAA Championships. Morrison excelled at the BIG EAST Championships, taking the crown in the long jump at 7.69m, and securing the silver medal in the triple jump at 14.82m., behind Johnson. The senior has been a prime time performer throughout his UConn career, qualifying for the 2023 Outdoor Championships in the long jump, taking his talents to Eugene and finishing 19th in the country with a jump of 7.52m. After securing his spot in the 2024 NCAA East First Round last outdoor season, Morrison is back on the national stage in his senior season for the indoor championships, ready to continue the historic run in Virginia Beach.\n\n\"Like Kyle [Johnson] and I have been saying, we're viewing this as just another meet,\" Morrison said. \"We're going to have fun, compete, and do what we do best.\"\n\nWhile Morrison makes his return to the NCAA Championships, Johnson will make his NCAA Championships debut in the triple jump. The sophomore has put together several breakout performances in the 2024-2025 indoor track & field season, setting the UConn indoor program record in the triple jump at 16.07m at the Coach Greg Roy-al Rumble in Storrs at the beginning of February. Johnson took home hardware of his own in Chicago at the BIG EAST Championships, securing the triple jump championship with a jump of 15.60m. Johnson's first season in Storrs proved to be a sign of things to come, winning the triple jump at both the BIG EAST Indoor and Outdoor Championships, joining Morrison in the NCAA East First Round last season as well.\n\n\"It feels pretty good to qualify and get on the national stage and compete with some of the top dogs and make a name for myself and the programs,\" said Johnson.\n\nBoth Johnson and Morrison have been key contributors to a jumping squad that has received national prominence throughout the season, being ranked in the event squad top 10 in the long jump and triple jump. While the results of the season are shining through now, both jumpers have made it clear that the foundation has been set for a while.\n\n\"It all starts in the summer [in Orlando]. We've been working since the summer, working on Thanksgiving Break and December Break,\" Morrison emphasized. \"That's what separates us from everyone else.\"\n\n\"It all starts in the summer, and building yourself up,\" Johnson echoed. \"It starts with your mentality, doing the little things when everybody else isn't.\"\n\nAs both record breakers gear up for their trip to Virginia Beach, they have gained perspective on what their NCAA appearances mean to the UConn track & field program.\n\n\"Not many of us go to NCAAs, so it's a pretty big deal to represent UConn and ourselves, to compete and put us on the map,\" said Morrison.\n\n\"I feel like it's an honor to represent UConn on a national stage,\" Johnson emphasized. \"Not many people get the chance to make a name not just for ourselves, but for the chance to put the program on the map.\"\n\nQuote from Director of Track & Field Beth Alford-Sullivan:\n\n\"What a great accomplishment for Marc and Kyle. Both setting school records and both making the Indoor NCAA meet. This is the first time in a long time UConn has had 2 men at the indoor championships and I am extremely proud of these guys. I am excited to see them compete the best of the best this weekend and see where they land!\"\n\nMorrison and Johnson will both have their chance to put UConn track & field on the national stage this weekend in Virginia Beach, with Morrison competing in the long jump on Friday at 7:00pm, and Johnson in the triple jump on Saturday at 5:20pm. The NCAA Division I Track & Field Indoor Championships will be streaming on ESPN+ throughout the weekend.",

Huh) AP\n\nBears general manager Ryan Poles and coach Ben Johnson met with reporters Wednesday at Halas Hall on the first day of the new NFL year and the official start of free agency.\n\nThe Bears announced a couple of trades and free-agent signings Poles agreed to over the past week. The team made their trades for offensive linemen Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson and the free-agent signings of defensive tackle Grady Jarrett and tight end Durham Smythe official as the new league started at 3 p.m.\n\nPoles and Johnson will look to make roster additions as free agency continues this week and the draft takes place next month. Here are four of the most interesting things Poles and Johnson said Wednesday.\n\nOn the decision to trade for guards\n\nOver the past couple of seasons, Poles said he\u2019s learned to be on his toes and ready to move in case something pops up. He used those lessons when he decided to replace both of his starting guard spots through trades instead of free agency.\n\nWhen Poles learned that Thuney and Jackson were available to acquire through trades, the Bears did their research and relied on their familiarity to move quickly.\n\n\u201cThere were two guys who we were really familiar with, that we know can help us not only from a leadership perspective, but also on the field,\u201d Poles said. \u201cWhen that popped open, we were able to jump on it.\u201d\n\nThe Bears acquired Thuney from the Kansas City Chiefs for a 2026 fourth-round pick and Jackson from the Los Angeles Rams for a 2025 sixth-round pick. Poles and Thuney spent time together in Kansas City. Johnson and Jackson were together with the Lions.\n\nAlthough the Bears were set to hit free agency with ample spending money, Poles said he didn\u2019t want to bet on money being the sole factor in a free agent\u2019s decision. In his view, sometimes a player values a location or a team\u2019s situation more than who can throw the largest amount of money at them.\n\nWith known commodities in Thuney and Jackson, Poles didn\u2019t feel like it was worth the wait.\n\nOn the process of acquiring Thuney, Jackson\n\nPoles and Johnson looked for a lot of different characteristics when choosing whom to bring into the offensive line room. As Johnson described it, they wanted linemen who were \u201ctough, gritty and dirty.\u201d\n\nBut there was one characteristic that Poles and Johnson both looked for and felt Thuney and Jackson both exemplified: intelligence.\n\nJohnson plans to run an offense that will require its players to be versatile and knowledgeable in running different fronts and schemes. He considers the interior of the offensive line an essential part of making that work.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to have some versatility with our scheme, some multiplicity if you will,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple guys in the building now that we feel can strongly handle a variety of different concepts and schemes that we might want to employ each and every week.\u201d\n\nThuney and Jackson will bring different levels of intelligence through experience. Thuney is a four-time All-Pro who won four Super Bowls with the Patriots and Chiefs. He\u2019ll make a major impact in quarterback Caleb Williams\u2019 growth during his second year.\n\nJackson was someone Johnson believes can be a Pro Bowl-caliber player with the Bears after watching him play right guard with the Lions. Johnson felt Jackson was out of position with the Rams last season when he moved around between guard and center.\n\nLeadership matters\n\nThe Bears added veteran leadership with all four of their moves Wednesday. Each player has been in the league since at least 2020, and Jarrett, Thuney and Smythe have played in the NFL since 2018.\n\nThat experience was something Poles and Johnson wanted to add to the locker room after a season during which players repeatedly asked to be held accountable. Johnson felt the group that met with reporters Wednesday, Jarrett, Thuney and Jackson, would provide valuable leadership and experience.\n\n\u201cAll three of these guys, they\u2019ve been in the playoffs, they\u2019ve won playoff games,\u201d Johnson said. \u201c[Thuney] in particular has won Super Bowls. That does rub off on the rest of the locker room.\u201d\n\nThuney\u2019s leadership is something Poles and Johnson pointed out Wednesday. Thuney was a major leader for the Chiefs last season, and his teammates voted him as the team\u2019s most valuable player last year.\n\nPoles expects Thuney\u2019s impact to stretch beyond the offensive line room.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s seen a lot of different things, played with a lot of different players,\u201d Poles said. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of maturity and leadership that is going to enhance not just the offensive line room but our entire roster.\u201d\n\nImpact on the Bears\u2019 draft strategy\n\nThe Bears' roster looks different compared with how it did at the end of last season.\n\nPoles turned over the interior of the offensive line with the trades for Thuney and Jackson and the reported signing of center Drew Dalman. They also added to the defensive line with Jarrett\u2019s signing and the reported addition of defensive end Dayo Odeyingbo.\n\nThose moves will change the way the Bears will approach the draft next month in Green Bay.\n\n\u201cThis really opens the whole board for us,\u201d Poles said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to sit back and do what\u2019s the best thing to do for the Chicago Bears and who\u2019s the best player who can make an impact.\u201d\n\nThe Bears will have four top-100 picks in the draft: No. 10 , No. 39, No. 41 and No. 72.\n\nPoles could choose to add depth to both lines. Or he could make a splash for a top running back with the picks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some decisions,\u201d Poles said, \u201cand a lot of film to watch between now and the draft.\u201d\n\nChicago Bears new head coach Ben Johnson talks to media during a news conference at Halas Hall in Lake Forest, Ill., Wednesday, March 12, 2025.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson has been fighting lawsuits related to its talcum powder tooth and nail for the better part of two decades. A key decision looms that could finally allow the healthcare giant\u2014and potentially the thousands of victims who brought the lawsuits\u2014to move on.\n\nTalc, for short, was discovered by a J&J scientist in the 1890s and has been used to absorb odor and oil, reduce rashes and skin irritations, coat surgical gloves and even dust condoms, among many more uses over its history. Talc is a mined mineral made up of magnesium, silicon and oxygen and closely associated with asbestos, another naturally occurring mineral that was declared a carcinogen in 1973. Studies have been murky on whether asbestos-free talc is any safer. Manufacturers began separating talc and asbestos in the 1970s.\n\nThe product was first linked to human harm as early as the 1930s and has since been tied to ovarian and cervical tumors. Talc was officially deemed a carcinogen in 1993 by the U.S. National Toxicology Program. But J&J continued marketing its products. The World Health Organization in 2010 warned of a 30% to 60% increase in the risk of ovarian cancer among people who used baby powder that contained talc.\n\nThe first lawsuit was filed in 2009 by a 49-year-old South Dakota woman named Deane Berg who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2006. J&J offered her a $1.3 million confidential settlement, but she declined and took the matter to court. In 2013, she won her case but received no compensation from J&J.\n\nAfter the verdict, two class action cases were filed. In February 2016, J&J was ordered to pay $72 million to the family of a Missouri woman who died of ovarian cancer that was linked to her baby powder use. This was the first time that J&J was ordered to pay over the talc disputes, but months later, a verdict handed down in St. Louis ordered the company to pay $55 million to a different South Dakota woman. In this case, the jurors agreed that J&J\u2019s product was to blame for the woman\u2019s cancer.\n\nSince then, thousands of individual and class action lawsuits have been filed against J&J. One ruling in July 2018 put J&J on the hook to pay $4.69 billion to 22 cancer victims, which in turn spurred more people to come forward.\n\nJ&J eventually bowed to the pressure and took its talc products off the market in North America in May 2020.\n\nThen came the Texas two-step.\n\nThird Time\u2019s the Charm\n\nIn October 2021, J&J created a new subsidiary called LTL Management, shifting its consumer goods into one unit and the talc liabilities into the new one. The new subsidiary then filed for bankruptcy. This is known as a Texas two-step, a maneuver that can allow larger companies to shield themselves from current or future litigation by essentially spinning out the liabilities. J&J funded the unit with $61.5 billion to cover the talc claims and any bankruptcy expenses.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing created an uproar in Congress, with multiple Democratic senators denouncing J&J\u2019s brazen move and calling for an end to the legal loophole. J&J\u2019s bankruptcy filing was rejected by an appeals court in January 2023. J&J tried again later that year, but was rejected once more.\n\nBut third time\u2019s the charm. J&J executed yet another Texas two-step in September 2024, creating a new subsidiary called Red River Talc LLC. This time, the company managed to gather the support of 83% of the current claimants to the litigation. J&J said the goal was \u201cto fully and finally resolve all current and future claims related to ovarian cancer arising from cosmetic talc litigation against the Company and its affiliates in the U.S.\u201d\n\nHow much claimants might ultimately get under the Red River offer is a bit murky. J&J originally offered $13.7 billion total to be paid out over 25 years, or $6.5 billion in today\u2019s currency. The offer was later boosted to $8 billion in today\u2019s value. A judge in 2023 said this would be the largest settlement in any asbestos-related bankruptcy case and the largest personal injury claim settlement in U.S. history.\n\nA hearing to consider the bankruptcy plan for Red River Talc finished up on Feb. 28. Now, the industry awaits the decision from the Texas Bankruptcy Court.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping for a decision in favor of JNJ, which would be positive for investor perception, but we cannot predict the outcome,\u201d Leerink Partners wrote in a March 5 note to clients. \u201cIf the ruling favors JNJ, we would expect JNJ to move swiftly to make payments in order to try to put the litigation in the rear-view mirror.\u201d\n\nEither party to the lawsuit could appeal yet again if they lose and the matter could make its way to the Supreme Court if there\u2019s no resolution. One of the law firms representing talc victims, Beasley Allen, has objected strongly to J&J\u2019s plans, arguing that the compensation would not be enough to cover the medical bills of the people with ovarian cancer. The average cost of treatment is around $220,000 total, the firm said .\n\nBeasley Allen also called into question the voting process used to get the 83% of claimants on board. While more than 99% of those suing J&J have ovarian cancer, Beasley Allen said that people with other types of cancer were included in the voting.\n\nPrior to the hearing, J&J called out Beasley Allen for continuing to fight the bankruptcy plan while not securing any funds for its clients. The Big Pharma also defended its latest Texas two-step approach. \u201cThe plan constitutes one of the largest settlements ever reached in a mass tort bankruptcy case and far exceeds the 75% approval threshold required by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,\u201d J&J said in a statement.",

            "content": "A Decade Of Data Sharing: Insights From J&J And Yale's YODA Project\n\nA conversation with Joseph S. Ross, MD, MHS, and Karla Childers, MS\n\nSharing clinical trial data is critical to advancing science, medicine, and public health. Every year, vast amounts of participant-level data are generated. However, when unpublished or unshared, the potential for those data to inform clinical practice is lost, limiting the valuable contributions of research participants. To unlock the full impact of clinical trial data, sharing that data is essential to drive innovation and accelerate meaningful discoveries.\n\nOver the past decade, the rise in data sharing has underscored the importance of openness within the industry. Since 2014, Johnson & Johnson has partnered with the Yale University Open Data Access (YODA) Project to create a consistent framework for independently assessing external research proposals that request access to Johnson & Johnson and other companies\u2019 clinical trial data. This partnership has strengthened transparency, expanded scientific knowledge, uncovered new insights, and spurred innovation.\n\nIn this Q&A, Joseph S. Ross, MD, MHS, Professor of Medicine (General Medicine) and of Public Health (Health Policy and Management) at Yale University and a member of the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CORE) at Yale-New Haven Hospital, and Karla Childers, MS, head of bioethics-based science and technology policy at Johnson & Johnson, reflect on a decade of data sharing and the lasting impact of the YODA Project on the field.\n\nWhy is sharing clinical trial data important, and how does the YODA Project contribute to this effort?\n\nChilders: Sharing clinical trial data is essential for advancing our understanding of diseases, expanding the knowledge needed to develop new treatments, and uncovering insights that lead to more informed healthcare decisions. By responsibly sharing clinical trial data, we aim to establish better healthcare data-sharing practices that help enable the generation of new insights and informed decision-making that ultimately improve patient care.\n\nYale University and Johnson & Johnson established the YODA Project with that goal in mind. As of January 1, 2025, the YODA Project has received, reviewed, and approved 431 complete research proposals, resulting in 157 publications in prominent medical journals such as JAMA Neurology, World Psychiatry, Lancet Psychiatry, and the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.\n\nHow has clinical trial data sharing evolved over the past decade?\n\nChilders: Over the past decade, collaboration among sponsors, academia, patient groups, and governments has helped develop solutions that propel science, medicine, and public health forward. This collective effort has helped establish policies and programs that make valuable research data accessible to the broader scientific community, fostering innovation and discovery.\n\nAs an example, in 2015, the NIH reinforced the importance of data accessibility by announcing its intention to make digital data from its funded studies publicly available. The launch of the Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy in January 2023 further reinforced this commitment. Under this policy, researchers receiving NIH support must share data from their studies. New proposals and competitive grant renewals must include a DMS outlining the expected data, associated metadata, timelines for preservation and access, distribution and reuse factors, oversight arrangements, and budget for allowable costs. After years of stakeholder engagement, this policy reflects a unified effort to maximize the public\u2019s investment in research and promote transparency.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry also has embraced data sharing, with sponsors partnering with multi-sponsor data-sharing platforms like Vivli to make their data accessible. Regulatory agencies, such as the European Medicines Agency and Health Canada, have introduced more progressive data-sharing requirements for companies seeking drug approvals. Additionally, organizations like the World Health Organization and the National Academy of Medicine have published positions emphasizing the need for responsible data sharing. For example, the Gates Foundation requires that data underlying published research be made immediately available and openly accessible.\n\nWhat challenges has the YODA Project encountered over the years? What changes were made as a result?\n\nRoss: Early on, one of the main issues was the limited number of \u201cseats\u201d available on the secure data-sharing platform and the restricted storage space for analyses, unless additional capacity was secured. By changing the underlying data-sharing platform, we can now accommodate all researchers, which is a significant improvement. Despite this progress, there has been a growing demand for specific software, additional storage space, and access to different types of data, highlighting the need for ongoing platform enhancements.\n\nAnother challenge in the project\u2019s early days was the lack of prioritization by some investigators who requested data access. Many researchers treated the data as an \"extra\" project, often failing to complete the analysis. To address this issue, the YODA Project clarified its expectations, emphasizing the requirement that researchers report the results of their analysis. Additionally, the project implemented an annual review process to assess whether investigators were actively working on their projects and still needed access to the data platform.\n\nThese changes have allowed the YODA Project to manage its resources more effectively and ensure the efficient use of the data-sharing platform.\n\nWhat best practices should industry experts know when evaluating research proposals?\n\nRoss: When evaluating research proposals, industry experts should adhere to several best practices to ensure research integrity and effectiveness. One critical practice is pre-specification, which involves asking investigators to clearly outline their research plans in advance. This ensures that the investigators have thoughtfully designed their studies, that the data are suitable for the intended purpose (i.e., the necessary variables are available), and that peer reviewers can verify adherence to the proposed plan when results are published.\n\nFor example, the YODA Project evaluates all requests from researchers seeking access to anonymized clinical trial data from Johnson & Johnson. The YODA Project operates on key tenets, including:\n\nProtecting patient privacy and honoring the commitments made to clinical trial participants\n\nApproving only scientifically sound proposals\n\nGoverning access through data use agreements\n\nRequiring researchers to report their findings\n\nProviding transparency in decision-making\n\nThese principles uphold the integrity of the research process and promote the responsible and effective use of data.\n\nBy adhering to these best practices, industry experts can foster high-quality research that advances science and medicine while maintaining ethical standards and protecting the interests of all stakeholders involved.\n\nWhat do you believe is the future of clinical data sharing?\n\nRoss and Childers: The future of clinical data sharing will likely be shaped by emerging technologies such as AI and ML. These tools are expected to revolutionize the efficiency and reliability of data-sharing processes. For instance, AI and ML can automate and streamline data management processes, reducing the time and effort required for data cleaning and analysis, which enables more efficient and accurate sharing of clinical data. Additionally, AI-driven security measures can enhance the protection of sensitive clinical trial data, ensuring that it is shared securely and complies with regulatory requirements.\n\nAs the volume of available data increases, AI and ML offer a tremendous opportunity to extract insights, particularly from underutilized data types such as imaging data or videos from procedures. These advanced technologies can uncover patterns and relationships that were previously inaccessible, thereby accelerating medical research and innovation.\n\nFurthermore, opportunities will likely emerge to link clinical trial data with other data sources. This integration could provide additional insights around prognosis and diagnosis, particularly when data from multiple trials are aggregated. This holistic approach would enable researchers to gain a more comprehensive understanding of diseases and treatments, ultimately improving patient care and advancing medical science.\n\nAbout The Experts:\n\nJoseph S.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other low risk stocks.\n\nRisk is a key consideration in investing and portfolio management, as investors generally aim to achieve the maximum return per minimum unit of risk. The true risk of a stock is impossible to measure or quantify, but there are several metrics, such as the volatility of returns or equity beta, that can gauge the magnitude of risk relative to other companies. The equity beta of a stock represents the sensitivity, or correlation, between the returns of the stock and the returns of the broad market. An equity beta below one means that the stock does not respond as much as the broad market to different events, such as macroeconomic developments, monetary policy changes, etc. When a stock with low risk (low beta) is introduced into a portfolio, the overall expected risk of the portfolio is significantly reduced, while the expected return is usually not significantly compromised, leading to a better risk/return profile.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Long Term Low Risk Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nThere are times when the risk profile of a portfolio becomes a more important consideration than maximizing returns, such as during periods of economic uncertainty, market downturns, or when an investor nears retirement and prioritizes capital preservation over growth. In these situations, investors often shift their focus from aggressive returns, such as growth stocks, to minimizing potential losses, adjusting their portfolios to include more low-beta stocks, bonds, or other defensive assets.\n\nMarket volatility, geopolitical tensions, and changes in monetary policy can also drive investors toward safer investments to protect their capital. Understanding and managing risk, particularly through measures like equity beta, allows investors to navigate uncertain times without exposing themselves to unnecessary losses. While low beta stocks are usually more mature and low growth businesses, they can deliver strong returns during bear markets, as capital actively starts flowing into them and inflates their market valuation. Consequently, by rotating into low risk stocks at the right time, investors can achieve two goals at once \u2013 not only reduce the risk of the portfolio, but also significantly improve the potential return profile.\n\nWe believe the broad stock market is currently at a crossroads and has just entered a new \u201cTrump 2.0 regime,\u201d which will be dominated by unprecedented actions and measures. Not only does the new US administration employ tools such as tariffs that were not used on a large scale for decades, but it has also started some strategic political shifts that could threaten decade-long alliances (such as the US-Europe alliance). All of this, coupled with aggressive cost-cutting in federal budgets and spending, has introduced a lot of uncertainty and difficult-to-digest news for investors.",

            "content": "A microscopic view of inflammation of the digestive lining due to Crohn\u2019s disease\n\nUp toworldwide live with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which refers to two chronic conditions that cause inflammation in the digestive tract: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease. Both diseases cause the immune system to attack the digestive lining, resulting in chronic inflammation that can lead to lasting damage in the gut if left untreated.Getting a diagnosis of IBD can be challenging. Symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal cramping, bloody stools, fatigue and bowel urgency can be mistaken for having other causes. Because no single test can diagnose the condition, patients typically undergo a battery of tests, including endoscopy, scans, blood tests and tests that look for blood in stool. Besides confirming an IBD diagnosis, these tests help physicians pinpoint the type of IBD a patient has.Despite the difficulty in receiving a diagnosis and the complexity of the disease, people living with IBD have reason to feel hopeful. Johnson & Johnson has long been committed to developing treatments for IBD, including therapies that can suppress the immune system, reduce inflammation and decrease the severity of flare-ups. In the 1990s, the company pioneered the first biologic treatment to manage IBD symptoms. Since then, Johnson & Johnson has continued researching and developing therapies that improve patients\u2019 health.\u201cWe have more treatments available now,\u201d says Esi Lamous\u00e9, M.D., Ph.D., Vice President, Gastroenterology Disease Area Lead, Immunology, Johnson & Johnson, \u201cand more are in the pipeline across the industry.\u201dPart of the challenge is that IBD, like all immune-mediated conditions, is a multipathway disease. \u201cMany things combine to trigger and drive inflammation in the gut,\u201d says Dr. Lamous\u00e9. While genes may play a part, so does a person\u2019s gut microbiome and environmental factors, such as the foods they eat and their exposure to pollutants.\u201cWe still have a way to go to get closer to truly curing IBD,\u201d says Dr. Lamous\u00e9. \u201cBut the spectacular pace of drug development and deeper knowledge of the disease promise that we\u2019ll continue to build on the IBD therapies we\u2019ve already developed.\u201dThat promise wouldn\u2019t be possible without the doctors who first identified IBD more than a century ago, as well as the researchers who laid the groundwork for a clearer understanding of the disease and how to approach treatment.

While the initial HexaBody-CD38 clinical data is promising and showed robust clinical efficacy, following a thorough evaluation of the data, the market landscape, and Genmab\u2019s rigorous portfolio prioritization, Genmab will not pursue further clinical development of HexaBody-CD38.\n\n\u201cWhile we are disappointed that J&J has decided not to advance HexaBody-CD38, the data confirms the clinical potential of the HexaBody platform, reinforcing its value for future applications,\u201d said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab. \u201cWith EPKINLY\u00ae (epcoritamab) moving from strength to strength and two wholly owned assets, rinatabart sesutecan (Rina-S\u2122) and acasunlimab in Phase 3 development, we are confident in the potential of our existing pipeline of innovative antibody therapeutics. Genmab intends to maintain its laser sharp focus on and disciplined investments in our promising late-stage proprietary clinical pipeline and continues to execute against our capital allocation framework ensuring future growth.\u201d\n\nAs stipulated by the development and option agreement between Genmab and J&J for HexaBody-CD38, Genmab provided J&J with data from a clinical proof-of-concept study in multiple myeloma, including a head-to-head comparison with DARZALEX FASPRO\u00ae (daratumumab and hyaluronidase fihj).\n\nThe Phase 2 expansion Part B of the study assessed the objective response rate (primary endpoint) of intravenous HexaBody-CD38 versus subcutaneous daratumumab in patients with anti-CD38 antibody- na\u00efve relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.\n\nPreliminary data submitted by Genmab to J&J, inclusive of 88 patients who received a study treatment and 84 patients who were response evaluable (42 in each arm), demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 55% (95% CI: 39%, 70%) in the HexaBoby-CD38 IV arm vs. 52% in the daratumumab SC arm (95% CI: 36%, 68%); very good partial response (VGPR) or better rate was 29% vs. 17%; and complete response (CR) or better rate was 7% vs. 2%.\n\nDue to the relatively short follow-up time, secondary efficacy endpoints including duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were not mature yet. Treatment emergent Adverse events (TEAEs) above 20% in the Hexabody-CD38 arm were neutropenia, infusion related reactions, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. No new safety findings were observed in the daratumumab arm of the study. TEAEs leading to death included one patient in the HexaBody-CD38 IV arm and two patients in the daratumumab SC arm; none of these deaths was related to the study treatment. Follow-up is ongoing and more mature data will be presented at a future medical conference.\n\nThis news does not impact Genmab\u2019s 2025 Financial Guidance.\n\nConference Call Details\n\nGenmab will host a conference call to discuss this event today at 5:00 PM CET / 4:00 PM GMT / 12:00 PM EDT.

The trial consists of three parts: a dose-escalation phase (Phase 1) and an expansion phase (Part A and Part B). The primary objective of Phase 1 is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose and the maximum tolerated dose as well as establish the safety profile of HexaBody-CD38 monotherapy. The purpose of Phase 2 Expansion Part A is to assess the objective response rate of HexaBody-CD38 for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and other blood cancers. The purpose of Phase 2 Expansion Part B is to assess the objective response rate of HexaBody-CD38 versus subcutaneous daratumumab in patients with CD38 antibody na\u00efve relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. More information on this trial can be found at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04824794).\n\nAbout Genmab\n\nGenmab is an international biotechnology company with a core purpose of guiding its unstoppable team to strive toward improving the lives of patients with innovative and differentiated antibody therapeutics.

While the initial HexaBody-CD38 clinical data is promising and showed robust clinical efficacy, following a thorough evaluation of the data, the market landscape, and Genmab\u2019s rigorous portfolio prioritization, Genmab will not pursue further clinical development of HexaBody-CD38.\n\n\u201cWhile we are disappointed that J&J has decided not to advance HexaBody-CD38, the data confirms the clinical potential of the HexaBody platform, reinforcing its value for future applications,\u201d said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab. \u201cWith EPKINLY\u00ae (epcoritamab) moving from strength to strength and two wholly owned assets, rinatabart sesutecan (Rina-S\u2122) and acasunlimab in Phase 3 development, we are confident in the potential of our existing pipeline of innovative antibody therapeutics. Genmab intends to maintain its laser sharp focus on and disciplined investments in our promising late-stage proprietary clinical pipeline and continues to execute against our capital allocation framework ensuring future growth.\u201d\n\nAs stipulated by the development and option agreement between Genmab and J&J for HexaBody-CD38, Genmab provided J&J with data from a clinical proof-of-concept study in multiple myeloma, including a head-to-head comparison with DARZALEX FASPRO\u00ae (daratumumab and hyaluronidase fihj).\n\nThe Phase 2 expansion Part B of the study assessed the objective response rate (primary endpoint) of intravenous HexaBody-CD38 versus subcutaneous daratumumab in patients with anti-CD38 antibody- na\u00efve relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.\n\nPreliminary data submitted by Genmab to J&J, inclusive of 88 patients who received a study treatment and 84 patients who were response evaluable (42 in each arm), demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 55% ( 95% CI: 39% , 70% ) in the HexaBoby-CD38 IV arm vs. 52% in the daratumumab SC arm ( 95% CI: 36% , 68% ); very good partial response (VGPR) or better rate was 29% vs. 17% ; and complete response (CR) or better rate was 7% vs. 2% .\n\nDue to the relatively short follow-up time, secondary efficacy endpoints including duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were not mature yet. Treatment emergent Adverse events (TEAEs) above 20% in the Hexabody-CD38 arm were neutropenia, infusion related reactions, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. No new safety findings were observed in the daratumumab arm of the study. TEAEs leading to death included one patient in the HexaBody-CD38 IV arm and two patients in the daratumumab SC arm; none of these deaths was related to the study treatment. Follow-up is ongoing and more mature data will be presented at a future medical conference.\n\nThis news does not impact Genmab\u2019s 2025 Financial Guidance.\n\nConference Call Details\n\nGenmab will host a conference call to discuss this event today at 5:00 PM CET / 4:00 PM GMT / 12:00 PM EDT.

The trial consists of three parts: a dose-escalation phase (Phase 1) and an expansion phase (Part A and Part B). The primary objective of Phase 1 is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose and the maximum tolerated dose as well as establish the safety profile of HexaBody-CD38 monotherapy. The purpose of Phase 2 Expansion Part A is to assess the objective response rate of HexaBody-CD38 for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and other blood cancers. The purpose of Phase 2 Expansion Part B is to assess the objective response rate of HexaBody-CD38 versus subcutaneous daratumumab in patients with CD38 antibody na\u00efve relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. More information on this trial can be found at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04824794).\n\nAbout Genmab\n\nGenmab is an international biotechnology company with a core purpose of guiding its unstoppable team to strive toward improving the lives of patients with innovative and differentiated antibody therapeutics.

According to Ameriprise Financial, the S&P index is widely regarded as one of the most significant benchmarks for global equity markets. Over the past decade, dividend growth and share buybacks have become defining characteristics of the index, which includes numerous global dividend-paying companies. Dividend growth saw a sharp slowdown in the final quarter of 2024, largely attributed to the election and uncertainty surrounding potential policy changes. With these concerns now in the past, Ameriprise Financial expects a resurgence in dividend growth within the broader market. For 2025, projections indicate a potential 8% increase in dividend payouts, following growth rates of 6% in 2024 and 5% in 2023.\n\nThe report further mentioned that The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 also played a significant role in boosting dividends and share buybacks in 2018. By lowering the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, the legislation contributed to a surge in shareholder returns, with buybacks and dividend payouts reaching multi-year highs the following year. As the TCJA approaches its expiration in 2025, discussions around corporate tax reductions have resurfaced. While the proposed decrease from 21% to 15% is not as substantial as the previous cut, it could still provide an upside for shareholder returns within the broader market once a final decision is reached.\n\nCompanies with a history of regular dividend payments are generally seen as stable investments, reflecting their strong cash flow and financial resilience. These businesses are often found in defensive sectors such as consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, which tend to be less affected by economic fluctuations. As a result, they help investors manage portfolio risks more effectively. At the beginning of 2025, growing concerns over rising inflation and sluggish economic growth led investors to increase their exposure to defensive stocks. This shift in strategy was intended to protect portfolios from potential market volatility linked to these economic uncertainties.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team shared their perspective on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned the list of companies that have delivered positive returns in 2025. From that group, we identified dividend companies with strong dividend policies and stable cash positions. We began with a pool of fifty companies, narrowed it down by considering their share price increases, and ultimately selected the top 14 dividend stocks with the highest share price gains as of March 7, arranging them in ascending order of performance.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nYear-to-Date Return as of March 7: 16.06%\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is an American pharmaceutical company that operates through its subsidiaries to develop, manufacture, and market a wide range of healthcare products. The company is one of the strongest dividend payers in the market, having raised its payouts for 62 consecutive years. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.98%, as of March 7.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) posted $22.5 billion in revenue, reflecting a 5.2% increase from the prior year. As a leading healthcare company, it remains focused on addressing diseases with significant unmet medical needs, including multiple myeloma, lung cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and heart failure.\n\nThe MedTech division saw 6.2% operational sales growth globally, with acquisitions and divestitures contributing 1.5% to this increase. Growth in the Cardiovascular segment was driven by strong demand for electrophysiology products and Abiomed, while robust sales of wound closure products supported the General Surgery division.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has strengthened its position through a strategic shift toward brand-name drug development. Following the 2023 spinoff of its consumer health segment, Kenvue, the company\u2019s innovative medicine segment now accounts for nearly two-thirds of its total sales. While brand-name drugs have a limited window of exclusivity, their strong pricing power and high margins make them a key driver of profitability. JNJ has surged by over 16% in 2025 so far, which makes it one of the best performing stocks on our list.\n\nOverall JNJ ranks 5th on our list of the best performing dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JNJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "How George E. Johnson made millions in the hair care industry while following the Golden Rule\n\nChicago \u2014 George E. Johnson, at 97, is a rich man. He\u2019s been a rich man since the 1960s. He\u2019s owned yachts, cattle ranches and a home in France. Years ago, he took a French lover; they divorced after a short marriage. He lived in Glencoe much of his life. He had a tennis court and swimming pool, and when his first wife came home from Neiman Marcus carrying thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of designer clothes, he blinked and showed concern, but Joan, his wife, said they had money, what was the worry? Johnson was a rich man.\n\nHis mother nicknamed him \u201cThe Rich Man\u201d before he actually was a rich man. He acted like one. His mother left Mississippi at 18 and arrived in Chicago as part of the Great Migration. He grew up near Bronzeville and took small jobs as early as age 6. He waited tables, washed cars, swept floors, shined shoes. After he made a little cash, he took horseback riding lessons around Hyde Park. He bought wide-legged jodhpurs and liked to walk around wearing them. He would also carry a riding crop, just because.\n\n\u201cI worked my butt off and did things a young Black man didn\u2019t do then,\u201d he said recently. \u201cI took my riding lessons in Washington Park. I went to the theater. I went to the opera. I dressed up for school every day. And I made money. I was never unemployed.\u201d\n\nThe other morning he looked out across Chicago, from his apartment on the 64th floor of Water Tower Place. It wraps around a corner of the skyscraper. From here you can see the West Side; turn and watch steam curling out of rooftops along Michigan Avenue. Jeanne Gang\u2019s long, skeletal St. Regis stands tall in one window, though it\u2019s actually a mile way.\n\nBehind him was one of the Picassos he owns.\n\nBeside him was a grand piano topped with a white bust, Schroeder-like. Around him were sculptures and vases and elegant cream-colored furniture he\u2019s been collecting for decades, mingled with the paintings brought in by his third wife, renowned art consultant Madeline Murphy Rabb. They were married three years ago, when Johnson was 94.\n\nIt\u2019s been a life.\n\nAnd yet Johnson, as he insists in his new memoir, \u201cAfro Sheen: How I Revolutionized an Industry with the Golden Rule, from \u2018Soul Train\u2019 to Wall Street,\u201d never thought of himself as a capitalist. Being a capitalist meant greed, an accumulation of wealth, and Johnson accumulated plenty, but he lived by a question you don\u2019t hear often in 2025:\n\nHow much money does one man need?\n\nHe decided recently that his story, and the lessons of his career, might be useful now.\n\nJohnson made his money selling hair care products designed for Black communities. Afro Sheen, Ultra Sheen, Classy Curl, Gentle Treatment, along with Black Tie cologne. He made those. He created Johnson Products Co., which had a warehouse beside the Dan Ryan for decades. (Today, it\u2019s home to Perspectives Leadership Academy, at Lafayette Avenue and 85th Street.) In the 1970s, Johnson Products became the first Black-owned business traded on Wall Street. Johnson used the money from that success to bankroll a Chicago TV show with national aspirations, \u201cSoul Train.\u201d\n\nThroughout his four-decade long control of Johnson Products, he had a profit-sharing policy with employees. He had hundreds of employees and provided full health care, an on-site nurse, six sick days annually, four-day (paid) weekends every holiday, family leave, college tuition reimbursement (a decade before it was common) and a subsidized employee cafeteria.\n\nHe is proof a company can trickle down profits, when the will is there.\n\n\u201cI had spent the money that I made early on educating (barbers and hair stylists) how to use my project and it worked out well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut listen, when the stockbrokers told me I had to discontinue profit sharing, saying investors would not stand for giving away 25 percent of profits, before taxes, to employees, I said: \u2018Well, that\u2019s a deal breaker.\u2019 They thought I was crazy. I was not crazy. I was determined to keep profit sharing. My company started in \u201954. By 1960, I was profit sharing. My feeling was, look, these people helped make my money, why not share it?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m going to pause a moment to peek outside and see if the universe imploded.\n\nNope, looks good.\n\nOn the wall of his office are photos you might expect someone with this kind of success. Johnson with Barack Obama. Johnson with the Clintons. Johnson with Jesse Jackson (a close friend). Johnson with Muhammad Ali. Johnson with Oprah Winfrey. Beneath those, a note from Martin Luther King Jr., who toured the Johnson factory and proclaimed: \u201cNow this is Black power!\u201d About 90% of the staff were Black. King announced the creation of Operation Breadbasket in the cafeteria. Within seven years of business, the company was pulling in $7 million (adjusted for 2025 dollars) and hosting hairdresser dinners. In 1961, Louis Armstrong was the entertainment.\n\nAll of which emerged from Johnson\u2019s signature hair straightener for men, Ultra Wave, then his Ultra Sheen relaxer for women, which reduced the heat and grease needed for straightening. The products themselves, said Hilary Beard, who helped Johnson write his memoir, contributed in its own way to the growth of a Black middle class in America.\n\n\u201cHis relaxer meant your hair would be permanently straight, or straighter,\u201d she said, \u201cand that meant Black people could access work \u2014 so they could be seen as human. It\u2019s hard for people to understand that now, but George was practicing and helping diversity and inclusion before the rest of mainstream Chicago businesses even considered it.\n\n\u201cI grew up in a world George created.\u201d\n\nJohnson looks tired, and happy. He has a wide, ingratiating smile. He remembers exactly why he decided to write a memoir at 97: \u201cIt was Nov. 21, 2021. A Sunday morning. I was sitting in the family room in my chair and all of a sudden the room got bright and I heard five words: \u2018YOU MUST TELL YOUR STORY.\u2019 I never intended to do a book. When I retired people asked, but I had no intention. My grandkids asked how I started the company, I\u2019d think about the lessons the Lord bestowed and start to cry. I didn\u2019t like talking about myself. I could never get through a story.\n\n\u201cI also considered that the way I met Orville Nelson was God\u2019s plan.\u201d\n\nNelson was a hotshot Chicago barber to Black celebrities, and Nat King Cole\u2019s personal barber. Johnson and Nelson met at Fuller Products Co., a Black-owned cosmetics business, where Johnson was the head production chemist. Nelson wanted Fuller to make a better straightener. When Fuller passed on the idea, Johnson started working on solutions. He partnered for a time with Nelson.\n\nBut soon Johnson learned that Nelson was selling his own variation on their straightener, using some of Johnson\u2019s work, but without Johnson\u2019s knowledge. Their partnership dissolved soon after, and Johnson remained an acolyte of his former boss, S.B. Fuller, who was one of the richest Black men in America in the mid-1950s. Like Fuller, he saw his new company not as a way to get rich but to create generational wealth on the South Side.\n\nJohnson\u2019s memoir, then, plays like an alternate history, as seen through hair. As Black Power grows popular in the 1960s and people begin wearing their hair more natural, Johnson pivots to Afro Sheen. As Jheri curls take off and curly perms show few signs of being a fad, Johnson feels squeezed by competition, including Revlon.\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, he resigns from the company and as part of a divorce settlement, he turns over a controlling stake to his first wife, Joan, who eventually sells to the Ivax pharmaceutical corporation, which is swallowed by L\u2019Oreal, which divests itself of several Johnson brands, and Johnson Products Co. eventually peters out around 2009.\n\nBack at his apartment, Rabb comes into the room.\n\n\u201cYou said you were never afraid of failure,\u201d she tells her husband.\n\nJohnson nods.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t. I really wasn\u2019t. I spent 10 years with Fuller, and his philosophy was the Golden Rule, and I absorbed it.\u201d The Golden Rule, in case you\u2019ve forgotten, is quite old school: Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself.",

            "content": "Johnson grew up in Freeport, Illinois, the 9th of 10 children. He majored in history at the University of Illinois (B.A., 1968) and, after studying public affairs at Princeton University (M.A., 1972), moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Urban League. He began cultivating valuable political and business connections that later helped him bankroll his vision of creating a Black-owned cable television company. As a lobbyist for the nascent cable industry from 1976 to 1979, he noticed that the large African American TV audience was going unrecognized and untapped. Johnson built BET from a tiny cable outlet, airing only two hours of programming a week in 1980, to a broadcasting giant that claimed an audience of more than 70 million households.\n\nIn 1991 BET became the first Black-controlled company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. BET thrived in the 1990s, adding more cable channels and expanding its reach through new film and publishing divisions, music channels, and a website. Viewership expanded along with the product line, while major media companies began to invest in the growing network. After taking BET private again in 1998, Johnson and his partners sold BET Holdings to the giant media group Viacom in 2001 for some $3 billion, though he remained at BET as its chief executive officer until 2005. The sale made him the first African American billionaire. Johnson then formed the umbrella group RLJ Companies, which operated widely in the media, sports, gaming, real estate, and hospitality industries.\n\nAfter attempting to purchase a National Basketball Association franchise throughout the 1990s, Johnson was approved as the owner of an expansion team in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2003 (the city\u2019s former team, the Hornets, had just moved to New Orleans, Louisiana). The new team, called the Bobcats, began competition in 2004. Johnson\u2019s purchase of the franchise, estimated at $300 million, also included the Sting, the Women\u2019s National Basketball Association team in Charlotte. Johnson launched C-SET (Carolinas Sports Entertainment Network), a regional sports and entertainment cable TV network, in October 2004. The channel struggled, however, and it ceased operations the following year. The two basketball teams also lost money. In 2006 Johnson transferred ownership of the Sting to the WNBA, and the team folded in 2007. In 2010 he sold a majority stake in the Bobcats to Michael Jordan.\n\nJohnson\u2019s other ventures included Our Stories Films, which he founded in 2006 with the film producers Harvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein. The company developed family-oriented movies aimed at African American audiences. In 2007 RLJ Companies, international development and humanitarian aid organization CHF International, and the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation\u2014an independent government agency created in 1971 to aid overseas investments and promote economic development in newly emerging markets\u2014established the Liberian Enterprise Development Finance Company to promote investment and project development in Liberia.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Saturday unveiled a short-term funding bill that would avert a shutdown at the end of next week and keep the government running through the end of September.\n\nJohnson has said he will bring the funding bill to the floor for a vote early next week, likely Tuesday, before money runs out late Friday night. It\u2019s unclear whether it has the votes to pass either chamber, as it was not negotiated with Democrats, making it an important test for the new Republican trifecta on a must-pass bill that requires bipartisan backing to become law.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has backed Johnson\u2019s approach and said he\u2019ll sign the bill if it reaches his desk, which would avoid a shutdown less than two months into his term.\n\n\u201cAll Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post shortly after the bill was released. \u201cI am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country\u2019s \u2018financial house\u2019 in order. Democrats will do anything they can to shut down our Government, and we can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson speaks at a press conference about the House Republicans\u2019 proposed budget on Feb. 25. Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe continuing resolution, or CR, includes an increase in defense spending while reducing nondefense discretionary spending. It does not expand the budget for additional emergency funding, disaster designations or community project funding, also known as earmarks.\u201cThere\u2019s no Christmas tree effect here,\u201d a House Republican leadership staffer said. \u201cIt\u2019s just what we need to fund the government and to allow that to happen.\u201d\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, slammed the legislation within moments of its release Saturday.\n\n\u201cI strongly oppose this full-year continuing resolution, which is a power grab for the White House and further allows unchecked billionaire Elon Musk and President Trump to steal from the American people,\u201d she said. \u201cBy essentially closing the book on negotiations for full-year funding bills that help the middle class and protect our national security, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have handed their power to an unelected billionaire.\u201d\n\nEven prior to the bill\u2019s release, House Democratic leaders came out in opposition to Johnson\u2019s plan, warning that the emerging legislation could result in spending cuts to areas like health care, nutritional assistance and veterans benefits.\n\nThe gulf between the two parties on the continuing resolution raises the chances of a shutdown. If House Democrats unify against the bill, it\u2019s unclear if Johnson and the Republicans would be able to muscle it through the chamber on a party-line vote, like they did with the budget resolution last month.\n\nWith a wafer-thin 218-214 majority, just two Republican defections could derail the measure. And Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a vocal Johnson critic, has already vowed to vote no.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a challenge for us,\u201d Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, told reporters this week after he hosted a meeting on funding with key House and Senate Republicans.\n\nIf Johnson can push the stopgap bill through his chamber next week, all eyes would be on Senate Democrats. Republicans have a 53-47 advantage there, so Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., would need to secure seven Democratic votes to reach the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee, torched the bill, calling it a \u201cslush fund continuing resolution that would give Donald Trump and Elon Musk more power over federal spending \u2014 and more power to pick winners and losers, which threatens families in blue and red states alike.\u201d\n\nNeither party is pushing for a shutdown, but they continue to differ on how to avoid one. For Republicans, it could distract and delay them from passing a reconciliation package needed to tackle Trump\u2019s agenda on border security, energy and tax cuts. And Democrats have demanded guardrails on the president\u2019s power over spending directed by Congress, which the GOP opposes.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats have been blasting Trump, his billionaire adviser Musk and congressional Republicans for slashing federal spending and firing thousands of federal workers. And in a letter to colleagues Friday, Democratic leaders warned that a CR could impose more cuts that they called \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d\n\nBut a shutdown would furlough millions of remaining federal workers in every part of the country.",

The company also announced the initiation of a groundbreaking head-to-head study to evaluate its superiority over the injectable biologic ustekinumab.\n\nKey findings from the Phase 3 ICONIC-LEAD study, presented at the 2025 American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting, demonstrate the efficacy of once-daily icotrokinra. By Week 16, 65% of patients achieved clear or nearly clear skin (IGA 0/1), and 50% reached a PASI 90 response. By Week 24, these numbers rose to 74% and 65%, respectively, with nearly half achieving complete skin clearance. The safety profile remained favorable, with comparable adverse event rates between icotrokinra and the placebo group (49% each).\n\n\u201cPeople living with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis are seeking options that balance efficacy, safety, and ease of use,\u201d said Dr. Robert Bissonnette, ICONIC-LEAD study investigator. \u201cThese study results are promising, and show the potential for treatment with icotrokinra to offer patients the unique combination of complete skin clearance and a favorable safety profile in a once-daily pill.\u201d\n\nFurther reinforcing these results, the ICONIC-ADVANCE 1&2 studies revealed icotrokinra\u2019s superiority over deucravacitinib while achieving all co-primary and key secondary endpoints. These successes form the basis for the ICONIC-ASCEND trial, the first clinical study to compare an oral treatment against an injectable biologic in PsO.\n\n\u201cThe robust results seen to date underscore the potential for icotrokinra to shift treatment expectations in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis,\u201d said Liza O\u2019Dowd, Vice President, Immunodermatology Disease Area Lead at Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. \u201cAs part of our ongoing commitment to pioneer innovations for patients, we are proud to advance this first-in-class investigational targeted oral peptide.\u201d\n\nIf successful in the ASCEND study, icotrokinra could pave the way for a treatment paradigm shift, potentially becoming a first-line option for PsO patients prioritizing efficacy, safety, and convenience.\n\nFor the latest news on everything happening in Chester County and the surrounding area, be sure to follow MyChesCo on Google News and MSN.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson formally unveiled plans on Saturday for a government funding stopgap through September 30 \u2014 a measure intended to stave off a potential March 14 shutdown and buy time for Donald Trump and GOP leaders to steer key pieces of the president\u2019s agenda through Congress this summer.\n\nBut Democratic leaders quickly slammed the door on supporting the measure, raising the specter of a high-stakes clash next week.\n\nThe president himself on Saturday endorsed the measure, which includes some cuts to domestic spending programs that Democrats will likely oppose. GOP leadership aides said Saturday that it would increase defense spending by about $6 billion while domestic spending would drop by about $13 billion.\n\nAnd while GOP leadership aides stressed that the plan includes no partisan policy add-ons, it does include certain White House funding requests, such as some new money intended to help carry out additional deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nBut in an ominous sign for Congress\u2019 ability to stave off a shutdown next week, House Democratic leaders said they plan to vote against the bill, arguing it \u201crecklessly cuts\u201d domestic spending programs.\n\n\u201cThe legislation does nothing to protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, while exposing the American people to further pain throughout this fiscal year. We are voting No,\u201d Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said in a joint statement Saturday evening.\n\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington, Senate Democrats\u2019 top spending negotiator, also criticized the plan, saying in a statement Saturday that \u201cSpeaker Johnson has rolled out a slush fund continuing resolution that would give Donald Trump and Elon Musk more power over federal spending.\u201d Murray\u2019s counterpart in the House, Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, was even more blunt, writing in a statement: \u201cI strongly oppose this\u201d bill.\n\nHouse GOP leaders believe the plan is on track to pass the chamber, arguing that Trump\u2019s backing will help them win robust support among House Republicans on the floor this week, even as many ultraconservatives typically loathe such stopgap measures. Johnson hopes to hold the vote Tuesday on the 99-page bill, according to people familiar with the plans.\n\nBut it remains unclear how strongly Democrats \u2014 whose voters back home are furious over Trump\u2019s cuts to federal programs \u2014 are willing to turn next week\u2019s funding deadline into a showdown with the president, if it risks a government shutdown that could hurt even more federal workers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough choice now for Democrats to decide if they want to be the ones to shut down the government,\u201d a House GOP leadership aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, told reporters Saturday. \u201cIt is quite literally as clean a CR as you can draft.\u201d\n\nIf the short-term funding measure passes the House next week as Johnson expects, it will put immense pressure on Senate Democrats to go along with the same plan.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his leadership team have, too, said they want negotiations to continue instead of pursuing a long-term stopgap. But it\u2019s not clear how forcefully Schumer and his team will push their Senate Democrats to oppose the bill if it makes it to the chamber.\n\nAsked last week whether enough Democrats would support the bill to allow it to pass the Senate, Murray told CNN: \u201cI am not going to speculate.\u201d\n\nBefore its release, Jeffries strongly opposed the plan \u2014 preferring a long-term negotiated deal \u2014 and said Johnson and his GOP will need to pass it on their own. But a small number of House Democrats have privately discussed in recent days whether they should support the bill.\n\nJohnson and Trump have described the bill as a \u201cclean\u201d stopgap bill \u2014 noting that it doesn\u2019t include language to enshrine certain Trump priorities, such as DOGE cuts. But Democrats argue this kind of long-term stopgap bill lacks critical language that is contained in full-year negotiated bills that would make it easier for their party to put a check on Trump in court, if needed.\n\nRepublicans acknowledged the stopgap would give the White House more authority to spend as it chooses \u2014 a flexibility that GOP leadership aides described as necessary when Congress\u2019 spending is put on autopilot for another seven months.\n\n\u201cThe House and Senate have put together, under the circumstances, a very good funding Bill (\u201cCR\u201d)! All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week,\u201d Trump said in a post to social media on Saturday, in a direct push for his party to back the bill.\n\n\u201cGreat things are coming for America, and I am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country\u2019s \u2018financial house\u2019 in order,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Betsy Klein and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

The convenience of an oral pill over injectable treatments may appeal to patients and healthcare providers, potentially increasing market share for Johnson & Johnson. The ongoing head-to-head study will be crucial in determining the drug's competitive edge.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ: What is icotrokinra?\n\nA: Icotrokinra (JNJ-2113) is an investigational targeted oral peptide designed to selectively block the IL-23 receptor, used for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.\n\nQ: What were the key findings from the Phase 3 trials?\n\nA: The trials showed that nearly half of the patients achieved completely clear skin at Week 24, with a favorable safety profile and superiority to deucravacitinib.\n\nQ: What is the significance of the head-to-head study?\n\nA: It is the first-ever study comparing an oral pill to an injectable biologic, potentially setting a new standard in psoriasis treatment.\n\nRead the original press release here.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The pharmaceutical giant said this drug was safe and well-tolerated by patients, and no new safety signals were identified. No other details about the trial results were disclosed.\n\nThe open-label clinical trial\u2019s targeted enrollment was 840 adults ages 18 to 74. Participants received aticaprant once daily as an adjunct to depression drugs they were already taking. Efficacy goals for the 54-week study include measuring the percentage of patients with suicidal thoughts or behaviors as well as the change in score over time according to a scale used to assess depression symptoms.\n\nThe trial also measured for weight gain and sexual dysfunction, adverse effects that are common with currently available depression medications and lead many patients to stop taking them. Aticaprant was hoped to avoid or at least reduce these side effects. Better efficacy and improved safety and tolerability would be key advantages over the current slate of antidepressants. Analysts had projected aticaprant would become a blockbuster product.\n\nJ&J said analysis of the failed study is underway and more details will be presented at a future medical meeting. But even though this Phase 3 trial is ending, J&J isn\u2019t giving up on aticaprant. Based on the potential of the drug\u2019s mechanism, the company said it will explore future development opportunities in other areas of high unmet need.\n\nAticaprant is a small molecule designed to target and block kappa opioid receptors, an approach intended to modulate pathways that regulate mood and behavior. It\u2019s the same target hit by Neumora Therapeutics\u2019 lead drug candidate, navacaprant. In January, Neumora reported this daily pill did not beat a placebo on the main efficacy goal of a Phase 3 clinical trial.\n\nEarlier this week, Neumora said it will end the failed Phase 3 study, one of three late-stage tests for navacaprant. But the company also said it will apply learnings from the failed test to the two other Phase 3 studies, which have been paused for now. Changes include optimizing site selection and enhancing medical monitoring to ensure appropriate patients are enrolled. Neumora plans to resume the two studies later this month; preliminary data are expected in 2026. Neumora also stopped a Phase 2 test of navacaprant in bipolar depression in order to devote its resources to its major depressive disorder clinical research.\n\nSponsored Post How to Improve Employee Benefits While Reducing Insurance Costs Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.\n\n[Paragraph added with analyst comments.] In a note sent to investors Friday, William Blair analyst Myles Minter acknowledged Neumora\u2019s explanations for the trial failure and the planned adjustments to the two other Phase 3 tests. But he added that the back-to-back Phase 3 misses for Neumora and J&J against the kappa opioid receptor diminishes confidence in this target as a mechanism for treating major depressive disorder. The firm has reduced the Neumora study\u2019s probability of success to 5% and also downgraded the biotech\u2019s shares.\n\nAs for J&J, the company\u2019s neuroscience portfolio includes the blockbuster schizophrenia drug Invega and the nasal spray depression drug Spravato. The pharma giant is bringing a depression drug prospect into the fold via the $14 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies announced in January. Intra-Cellular\u2019s main asset is Caplyta, which has approvals in schizophrenia and bipolar depression. The drug is currently under FDA review for major depressive disorder, an indication that could make the once-daily pill a blockbuster seller. J&J expects to complete the Intra-Cellular acquisition later this year.\n\nPhoto: Mario Tama, Getty Images",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is terminating some research for an experimental drug that the company previously predicted could be a multibillion-dollar product.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday afternoon, J&J said it will stop developing the drug, called aticaprant, as an add-on therapy for patients with major depressive disorder. Over the past few years, a series of large, late-stage clinical trials tested aticaprant in adults who have hard-to-treat MDD and moderate-to-severe cases of a defining symptom of the disorder, anhedonia, which presents as a loss of interest or an inability to experience joy.\n\nWhile the drug continues to look safe and well-tolerated, the program has shown \u201cinsufficient efficacy in the target patient population,\u201d according to J&J. Aticaprant may still have potential, however, so the company plans to \u201cexplore future development opportunities\u201d in other \u201careas of high unmet need.\u201d\n\nJ&J says it remains committed to the neuroscience space, as evidenced by its recent agreement to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies \u2014 maker of the mind-stabilizing therapy Caplyta \u2014 for nearly $15 billion. The pharmaceutical giant noted, too, that it still expects its medicines division to hit a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7%. That division recorded $57 billion in sales last year, an increase of 4% from 2023.\n\nFor now, though, prospects appear dimmer for one of J&J\u2019s more closely followed projects. David Risinger, an analyst at Leerink Partners, wrote in a note to clients that Wall Street has been penciling about $1 billion in annual sales from aticaprant by 2032.\n\nJ&J had outlined an even rosier forecast in late 2023, when it projected peak annual sales could fall anywhere between $1 billion and $5 billion.\n\nThe setback will almost certainly dent those estimates, and could make J&J\u2019s goal of becoming the top neuroscience company by 2030 more difficult. Yet for a behemoth like J&J, aticaprant was just one of nearly 20 novel drug programs across its pipeline that it had said could eventually reach blockbuster status.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why J&J\u2019s stock was little affected Friday, rising more than 1%. Meanwhile, shares of Neumora Therapeutics, a biotechnology startup working on a similar drug, were down close to 5%.\n\nNeumora debuted in late 2021, armed with half a billion dollars in funding from some of the industry\u2019s most prolific venture capital firms, including Arch Venture Partners and Polaris Partners, as well as Amgen. The biotech continued to raise money and, in the summer of 2023, raked in another $250 million by going public.\n\nNeumora\u2019s stock took a sharp dive early this year, though, when a late-stage study found its drug navacaprant to be no better than a placebo at treating moderate-to-severe MDD. J&J\u2019s and Neumora\u2019s are both designed to block \u201ckappa opioid receptors,\u201d a type of protein that regulates various parts of the nervous system. Research indicates these proteins affect mood, stress and pain perception.\n\nBrian Abrahams, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, suspects the discontinued J&J trials could erode \u201cany residual hope\u201d these drugs might be useful in depression. It may also \u201ccast further doubt\u201d on the likelihood of success for Neumora\u2019s ongoing studies.\n\nStifel analyst Paul Matteis echoed those sentiments, writing in a note to clients that the news is a \u201cbig blow\u201d to the thesis around kappa opioid receptor drugs. Matteis downgraded his rating on Neumora stock to \u201cHold,\u201d arguing the stock \u201cbecomes much harder to defend\u201d following J&J\u2019s decision.\n\nNeumora shares are down more than 90% since the company\u2019s initial public offering, and, as of late Friday morning, they traded at roughly $1.45 apiece.\n\nAbbVie is also developing a kappa opioid antagonist it acquired via its Cerevel Therapeutics acquisition last year. According to the company\u2019s pipeline chart, the drug is in Phase 1 testing.",

Image credit: Shutterstock / josefkubes.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (J&J) is dropping its Phase III major depressive disorder (MDD) programme for aticaprant due to \u2018insufficient efficacy in the target population\u2019.\n\nThe VENTURA programme, evaluating the experimental drug as an adjunctive treatment for MDD, included five Phase III trials.\n\nThe company said that despite the efficacy failure, aticaprant remained safe and well-tolerated in the programme. Full data from the VENTURA programme will be presented at a future medical meeting.\n\nJ&J said it plans to \u201cexplore future development opportunities for aticaprant in other areas of high unmet need\u201d.\n\nA statement accompanying the announcement read: \u201cJohnson & Johnson continues to build on its leadership in neuroscience, as demonstrated by the company\u2019s significant investments in its current pipeline and the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies. The company remains focused on driving innovation in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.\u201d\n\nThere had been a lot of hope for aticaprant, with GlobalData previously touting it as the most promising pipeline product for MDD due to its novel MOA and focus on anhedonia, a hard-to-treat symptom.\n\nGlobalData analysis previously projected that aticaprant could generate global sales of approximately $670.63m in MDD by 2029 subject to approval. J&J\u2019s high hopes for the drug were also reflected, with the company saying the therapy had the potential to make $1bn to $5bn.\n\nReacting to J&J\u2019s news, Phillipa Salter, neurology analyst at GlobalData said: \u201cIt is surprising to see the announcement from J&J. Aticaprant had been effective in Phase II trials and the company had only recently initiated further Phase III trials within the VENTURA programme. VENTURA-5 initiated in September 2024 and VENTURA-7 initiated in June 2024 so it is surprising that the VENTURA programme is being discontinued so soon after this. J&J were targeting adults with MDD with moderate-to-severe anhedonia which is a hard to treat symptom of severe MDD.\u201d\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.\n\nNeumora\u2019s KOR antagonist also failed in Phase III trial\n\nAticaprant is a kappa-type opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist that should modulate dopamine and reward processing pathways. This is the second drug with this mechanism of action (MOA) to take a hit in MDD after Neumora\u2019s navacaprant failed to meet the the primary endpoint in the Phase III KOASTAL-1 (NCT06029426) study. Earlier this week, the US-based company announced it was halting two other studies of the drug to change the trial design of the KOASTAL-2 and KOASTAL-3 studies (NCT06058039 and NCT06058013).\n\nNeumora\u2019s stock, listed on the Nasdaq exchange, dipped on J&J\u2019s announcement, dropping by 13.15% from a market close of $1.52 yesterday (6 March) to a market open of $1.32 today. J&J\u2019s stock, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), has remained stable despite the announcement.\n\n\u201cThis news follows the recent news that Neumora Therapeutics\u2019 navacaprant, a drug with the same mechanism of action as aticaprant, failed a Phase III trial in MDD so there was prior information that this mechanism of action may not be effective for MDD,\u201d Salter added\n\nLast year, J&J had success in a Phase III trial of its therapy seltorexant, which helped MDD patients with insomnia, with the study meeting all its endpoints.\n\nThe MDD market across the eight major markets (8MM: US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, Japan, and Canada) is poised to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4% from $4.7bn in 2019 to $9.6bn in 2029.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to warn users to not trust billionaires. His remarks built on an earlier show, where he had shared that \u201cyou can\u2019t make money listening to a billionaire because they already have made money.\u201d\n\nThis time around, Cramer outlined that billionaires often share the sentiment that it\u2019s hard for others to become as rich as they are. \u201cThey close the door,\u201d he commented and added: \u201cWell they\u2019re always negative.\u201d Cramer also believes that luck might play a large role in making someone a billionaire. According to him: \u201cWe never, we never grade them because if they\u2019re billionaires we think that they have to be genius. We never think about luck. We just think, well they might have had really great trade.\u201d\n\nIn response, co-host David Faber pointed out that the one key trait that he has observed in most billionaires is their relentless drive. Cramer responded by sharing that billionaires are \u201ctiresome.\u201d He also felt that President Biden\u2019s goodbye speech about oligarchs was \u201ccompletely ignored.\u201d\n\nDuring the show, Cramer also commented on how using ChatGPT was proving troublesome. He outlined:\n\n\u201cI use ChatGPT like, probably maybe fifty times a day. I do it text and I\u2019m continually let down by the lack of rigor of what I get. I mean I\u2019ll say tell me everything I need to know about [a pharma company \u2013 BMY]. And it won\u2019t even have the patent cliff. Doesn\u2019t mention the patent. . . I mean it just doesn\u2019t get the story at all.\u201d \u201cWell no, you have to know, the key thing about I think about all these sites is you have to know how to put the question. Give me the pluses and minuses of [BMY], was the actual inquiry. And I just find that, it\u2019s just not rigorous. I mean you can\u2019t rely on it. You have to go to all the different sites. You know I go to. Claude-3 a lot. I\u2019d rather go to Claude Rains than Claude-3.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 26th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other best holding company stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe Treasury Yield Market\n\nThe treasury yield has been moving towards its lowest point in a month following a comment from the Treasury Secretary, Scott Besson. The secretary suggested that the new administration is focused on the 10-year treasury and its yield, rather than the Fed cutting interest rates. On February 6, Ed Mills, Managing Director at Raymond James, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on the market amid new economic, political, and tax policies.\n\nMills reiterated a very important factor raised in the Secretary\u2019s speech the day before, suggesting that the Trump tax cuts from 2017 were to be made permanent, adding $4 trillion to debt and deficit over the coming 10 years. He added that the policies also desire to cut tips and social security taxes, now bringing the total debt and deficit to $5 trillion. Mills suggested that the debt and deficit were so huge that it would be extremely challenging for the government to keep the \u201clong end of the curve down.\u201d\n\nWhy Value Investing is the Way to Go\n\nIn another interview on March 5 on Yahoo Finance, Michael Sonnenfeldt, founder and chairman at TIGER 21, shared his market thesis amid changing macroeconomic and political trends. He shared that while turmoil and confusion are encapsulating the market, his clients remain very strong, emphasizing his inclination towards value investing. He also added that his members are finding significant value in private equity and the private real estate industry.\n\nHe suggested that while a lot of indicators in the market point towards a possible rotation from growth into value, he remains cautious about the changing conditions, reiterating that it is currently very challenging to find value in the market environment. Sonnenfeldt added that focusing on the fundamentals of equities is of crucial importance at the moment, rather than company momentum, amid volatile economic and political conditions. He shed light on his member\u2019s buying strategy, which happens to be entirely focused on the basics of a stock, emphasizing that others should follow suit.\n\nWhile some stocks pose a risk due to the current market conditions, some stocks, especially those with strong fundamentals and long-standing businesses, offer greater protection and certainty.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 14 best holding company stocks to buy right now, we went over similar rankings on the internet and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment around every stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge funds, as of Q4 2024.",

Biden Jr. and does not account for the cuts being made by the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. But the president and speaker are embracing it as a way to avoid a politically damaging shutdown fight among Republicans while still affording Mr. Trump wide latitude to slash spending on his own in defiance of Congress.\n\n\u201cI am working with the GREAT House Republicans on a Continuing Resolution to fund the Government until September to give us some needed time to work on our Agenda,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote Wednesday on social media. \u201cConservatives will love this Bill, because it sets us up to cut Taxes and Spending in Reconciliation, all while effectively FREEZING Spending this year.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether the plan could pass by midnight on March 14 and avert a shutdown.

            "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both.\n\nThe popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.\n\nZacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nDeveloped alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nEach stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum investors, who live by the saying \"the trend is your friend,\" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.\n\nVGM Score\n\nIf you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nA proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.\n\nInvestors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nBut it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.\n\nHere's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s biggest strength is its diversified business model. It operates through pharmaceuticals and medical devices divisions. It has more than 275 subsidiaries, which clearly means that the business is extremely well diversified. Its diversification helps it to withstand economic cycles more effectively. J&J has 26 platforms with more than $1 billion in annual sales. Meanwhile, J&J has one of the largest R&D budgets among pharma companies.\n\nJNJ is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\n\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 15.63; value investors should take notice.\n\nFour analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.03 to $10.58 per share. JNJ boasts an average earnings surprise of 4.4%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, JNJ should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)?\n\nBefore you invest in Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

            "content": "According to data from Abrdn, it was noted that between December 2002 and December 2022, companies that either increased or initiated dividends achieved a compounded return of 10.68%. In contrast, firms that reduced or discontinued their dividends saw a significantly lower return of 2.70%. In addition, it was highlighted that companies not paying dividends also lagged behind dividend growers, generating a return of 9.25% over the same timeframe.\n\nDividends are a key component of the investment market, with nearly 80% of companies in the broader market distributing payments to shareholders. However, maintaining steady dividend increases is a difficult achievement. Only about 13% of companies in the index qualify for the Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes corporations that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Investors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks, as they have demonstrated strong long-term performance, especially during times of elevated interest rates.\n\nThe report mentioned that one possible scenario for 2025 is that earnings-per-share growth outpaces market gains, leading to a decline in overall price-to-earnings valuations. Factors such as prolonged high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainties could contribute to a lackluster year, causing some of the recent optimism to fade. However, if this happens, the market could regain momentum in 2026, making 2025 more of a temporary pause rather than a deeper downturn.\n\nAnalysts do not expect the market\u2019s strong run to persist this year. A report from Morgan Stanley points out that while the third year of a bull market tends to deliver only modest returns on average, it is usually not negative.\n\nStock market investors have enjoyed strong annual returns over the past two years, but analysts caution that 2025 may not deliver a repeat performance. In 2024, the broader market posted a 23% gain, following a 24% increase in 2023. When factoring in dividends, total returns for those years reached 25% and 26%, respectively. However, such sustained high returns are uncommon. According to Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, US stocks have only recorded three consecutive years of 20%-plus total returns once since 1928, during the late 1990s.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 15 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhen assessing the reliability of dividend stocks, analysts suggest that investors should emphasize dividend growth rather than being lured by high yields that may not be sustainable. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar\u2019s Index team, underscored the significance of dividend growth as a strategy distinct from high-yield investing. He pointed out that companies with consistent dividend growth often have strong competitive advantages and promising future outlooks. A portfolio focused on dividend growth generally mirrors the broader market in terms of sector allocation and the balance between growth and value characteristics, including price-to-earnings ratios. While it leans toward a value-driven approach, it remains more balanced and core-oriented compared to portfolios concentrated on high-yield stocks.\n\nAlthough dividend stocks did not experience the same level of gains as tech stocks in 2024, they still delivered impressive returns. That year, companies across the broader market that distributed dividends returned approximately 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, according to Bloomberg. On average, these companies had a dividend yield of around 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield was about 1.5%. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the broader market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned the list of the companies in the broader market and picked dividend stocks with dividend yields of about 2%, as of February 27. From that list, we picked 15 dividend stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of Q4 20234. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) the Best Retirement Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA smiling baby with an array of baby care products in the foreground.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 98\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company that operates through its subsidiaries to develop, manufacture, and market a wide range of healthcare products.

Together, with results from the PERSEUS study, this demonstrates the potential of daratumumab-based regimens as a foundational frontline therapy for all patient types.\u201d\n\nThe CHMP recommendation is supported by data from the Phase 3 CEPHEUS (NCT03652064) study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of daratumumab-VRd compared to VRd for patients with NDMM who are transplant ineligible or for whom autologous stem-cell transplant (ASCT) was not planned as initial therapy (transplant ineligible or deferred). Data from the study were previously presented at the 2024 International Myeloma Society (IMS) Annual Meeting and the 2024 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting.\n\n\u201cFor almost a decade, daratumumab has transformed the standard of care in multiple myeloma, and we have remained steadfast in our commitment to continue improving outcomes for all patients with this complex disease,\" said Jordan Schecter, M.D., Vice President, Disease Area Leader, Multiple Myeloma, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. \u201cAs our first registrational study in multiple myeloma with a primary endpoint of MRD-negativity, CEPHEUS underscores our dedication to innovate with purpose, as we unleash the full potential of our portfolio and build on our goal of delivering a cure.\u201d\n\nDaratumumab is currently approved in eight indications for multiple myeloma, four of which are in the frontline setting, including as part of treatment regimens for newly diagnosed patients who are eligible or ineligible for ASCT. On 23 October 2024, an indication extension for daratumumab-VRd was approved for newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma who are eligible for ASCT, following the results from the Phase 3 PERSEUS study that evaluated this daratumumab SC-based quadruplet regimen for induction and consolidation therapy.",

            "content": "Markets have continued to sell off this week as investors digest ensuing tariff implications and rising geopolitical tensions. That said, one stock that continues to stand out is Johnson & Johnson JNJ.\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant's stock hit new 52-week highs of nearly $170 on Tuesday, with JNJ now up +16% year to date. Seemingly acting as a defensive hedge against recent market volatility, let's see if it's time to buy JNJ shares for higher highs.\n\nJ&J\u2019s Diversification\n\nOf course, medical stocks are often sought during broader economic uncertainty as the essentiality of healthcare doesn\u2019t waver.\n\nWhat strengthens Johnson & Johnson\u2019s defensive capabilities is the company\u2019s diversification within the medical sector. Johnson & Johnson provides a wide range of pharmaceuticals across several therapeutic areas including oncology, immunology, and neuroscience among others.\n\nIn addition to this, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s medical device division offers solutions and operational equipment for orthopedics, advanced surgical procedures, and vision care. Bringing in $88.82 billion in 2024, Johnson & Johnson's top line is expected to rise 1% this year and is projected to increase another 3% in fiscal 2026 to $92.8 billion.\n\nEPS Growth\n\nMore intriguing, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s annual earnings are slated to rise 6% this year to $10.58 per share, compared to EPS of $9.98 in 2024. Plus, FY26 EPS is projected to increase another 4%.\n\nMonitoring J&J\u2019s Valuation\n\nAt current levels, JNJ still trades at a very reasonable 15.8X forward earnings multiple. This is a noticeable discount to the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s 22X and its Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry average of 18.1X, with some other notable names in the space being AbbVie ABBV, Eli Lilly LLY and Pfizer PFE.\n\nJNJ also trades beneath its decade-long median of 16.4X forward earnings with a high of 20.1X over the last 10 years. Less prone to major fluctuations in its valuation, it\u2019s noteworthy that JNJ has a beta ratio under 1.0 (0.47) which suggests this stock should be less volatile than the benchmark when considering market risk.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAfter such a sharp YTD rally, Johnson & Johnson stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Near 52-week peaks there could be better buying opportunities for JNJ shares but higher highs wouldn\u2019t be surprising.\n\nTo that point, investors may be compelled to hold JNJ as a hedge against recent market volatility, especially considering Johnson & Johnson\u2019s steady growth and reasonable valuation.\n\nThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).\n\nZacks Investment Research",

[It\u2019s] also the coaches and the support system and the teachers here.\u201d\n\nIn reflection of his time as an Eagle, Johnson\u2019s favorite moments came around his teammates.\n\n\u201cThe bus rides with teammates,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe bus rides back from games, the environment was really good.\u201d\n\nAs Johnson finishes his senior season before heading to Gaffney, S.C to join the Saints., he shared how he is a player that is working toward a goal while still focused on the tasks at hand.\n\n\u201c[I am] a player who looks forward to the future but is also stuck in the present,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBen Weaver \u2014 Newberry College\n\nSenior Ben Weaver signed to continue his soccer career at Newberry College. - photo by Garrett Pitts\n\n\n\nIt was an exciting and emotional day for Weaver as he put pen to paper to continue his soccer career at Newberry College.\n\nThroughout the excitement of the signing ceremony, Weaver shared the emotion he had to see his family in the crowd.\n\n\u201cIt is an exciting time,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cI thought I could handle it, but seeing my parents and my brother out there in the crowd, it was just a wave [of emotion] that hits you all at once. I have so much gratitude for so many things over the years.\u201d\n\nWeaver also gave thanks to all coaches, who he credited with helping him get an opportunity to play at the next level.\n\n\u201cI have been blessed,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThese coaches just pour in all this time and effort in us getting to the next level.

Shipp in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. A federal judge in Houston is set to decide on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $8.2 billion settlement offer in 2025. This ruling could potentially conclude thousands of cancer lawsuits related to J&J\u2019s baby powder. On May 1, 2024, Johnson & Johnson proposed a $6.48 billion settlement that would be paid out over 25 years. The settlement would address the lawsuits claiming its talcum powder caused ovarian cancer. This would cover 99.75% of the pending cases, but only if at least 75% of plaintiffs approve it. In September, J&J raised the offer by $1.75 billion after negotiating with attorneys who initially opposed the settlement. The J&J subsidiary Red River Talc filed for bankruptcy in Texas to facilitate the now-$8 billion settlement. This is the third time J&J has attempted to use Chapter 11 bankruptcy to finance a settlement, but courts ruled against previous attempts.\n\nStatus of Talcum Powder Lawsuits October 2024: On October 15, 2024, a Connecticut jury awarded $15 million to Evan Plotkin. Plotkin claimed he developed mesothelioma after using Johnson & Johnson's talcum powder products for decades. The jury also determined that Plotkin is entitled to additional punitive damages, which a judge will decide later.\n\nThe U.S. Trustee Program filed a new motion to dismiss the bankruptcy case that would allow J&J to complete the talc settlement. The program stated that the case was \u201ca textbook example of bad faith\u201d and J&J \u201chas no need for bankruptcy relief.\u201d\n\nHowever, earlier this month, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez allowed Red River Talc's bankruptcy case to remain in Texas. This is despite calls to move the case to New Jersey, where past J&J settlement attempts have failed. Lopez interpreted the case to be sufficiently different from J&J\u2019s previous bids for bankruptcy, thus justifying it being held in Texas this time.\n\nOn October 15, 2024, a Connecticut jury awarded $15 million to Evan Plotkin.

Asbestos and talc are minerals that commonly occur together underground, increasing the risk of cross-contamination. Talcum powder lawsuits can be for both consumer and industrial product use.\n\nTrent B. Miracle | 0:58 Why is it important to file a talcum powder lawsuit immediately? Attorney Trent Miracle explains statutes of limitations and why you should talk to a lawyer immediately about your talcum powder claim.\n\nInjuries Named in Talc Lawsuits\n\nMesothelioma is one of the cancers named in these suits. It can affect the lining of the lungs and abdomen after inhaling asbestos fibers, but it can also occur around the linings of other organs. Asbestos also causes ovarian cancer. The three most common injuries named in talc lawsuits are:\n\nOvarian cancer\n\nPleural mesothelioma (based in the lungs)\n\nPeritoneal mesothelioma (based in the abdomen)\n\nCosmetic and industrial talc contaminated with asbestos can lead to cancer with long-term use. Use may be personal \u2014 such as when diapering a baby or using powder products after a shower \u2014 or in an occupational setting, such as working on a contaminated construction site.\n\nTalcum powder used for perineal dusting has been linked to ovarian cancer.\n\nAsbestos-related illnesses are serious and often deadly, and some people develop cancer from talcum powder.\n\nWho Qualifies for a Talcum Powder Lawsuit?\n\nPeople who developed an asbestos-related illness after exposure to talcum powder may be eligible to sue. The first criterion is a diagnosis of an asbestos-related disease. A biopsy is the most effective way to confirm mesothelioma. A bronchoscopy may also identify asbestos fibers and differentiate mesothelioma from similar lung cancers. Exposure to talcum powder at home or in an occupational setting is another criterion. If someone suspects an asbestos-related disease is because of talc exposure, it\u2019s important to consult with a lawyer. A lawyer experienced in talc and asbestos cases will help collect necessary documents, file the lawsuit and argue on the plaintiff\u2019s behalf.\n\nDid You Know? Each year, doctors in the U.S. diagnose around 21,000 women with ovarian cancer, and nearly 13,000 women die from the disease. Source: American Cancer Society\n\nCompanies Named in Talcum Powder Lawsuits\n\nThe defendants in lawsuits involving industrial talcum powder are generally suppliers. In consumer-related lawsuits, the defendants are suppliers and manufacturers \u2014 some are well-known brands, such as Johnson & Johnson. Some suits have also named national retailers as defendants.\n\nDefendants named in various talc lawsuits include: Avon\n\nChanel\n\nColgate-Palmolive\n\nCVS\n\nEstee Lauder\n\nGold Bond\n\nImerys Talc North America\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nOld Spice\n\nMennen\n\nRevlon\n\nTarget\n\nVanderbilt Minerals\n\nWalgreens\n\nWalmart\n\nLawsuits for asbestos-containing talc products allege that the products caused a serious illness. They also allege and offer evidence that the companies knew about the issue and did nothing to resolve it or deliberately hid information.\n\nJohnson & Johnson Response to Talcum Powder Claims\n\nJ&J continues to insist that its talcum powder did not and does not contain cancer-causing asbestos. However, a lawsuit in Missouri against the company used unsealed emails as evidence that it was aware of the dangers. The emails revealed that scientists wrote a report in 2009 that highlighted potential health risks, but J&J told them to change the information. This ultimately led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration not adding cancer warnings to the talcum powder.\n\n\"[Johnson & Johnson] knew of the presence of asbestos in products that they knowingly targeted for sale to mothers and babies, knew of the damage their products caused and misrepresented the safety of these products for decades.\"\n\nBurlison made that comment when overseeing the lawsuit involving 22 women with ovarian cancer. Because the company knew about the health risks, the initial verdict of the case was $4.7 billion.\n\nInquiries Into Talc Contamination",

            "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Johnson & Johnson ( ) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\n\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.\n\nHow Much Debt Does Johnson & Johnson Carry?\n\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2024 Johnson & Johnson had debt of US$36.6b, up from US$29.3b in one year. However, it does have US$24.5b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$12.1b.\n\nHow Strong Is Johnson & Johnson's Balance Sheet?\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Johnson & Johnson had liabilities of US$50.3b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$58.3b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$24.5b in cash and US$14.8b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$69.3b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nSince publicly traded Johnson & Johnson shares are worth a very impressive total of US$397.3b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has a low debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.40. And remarkably, despite having net debt, it actually received more in interest over the last twelve months than it had to pay. So it's fair to say it can handle debt like a hotshot teppanyaki chef handles cooking. But the other side of the story is that Johnson & Johnson saw its EBIT decline by 5.3% over the last year. If earnings continue to decline at that rate the company may have increasing difficulty managing its debt load. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Johnson & Johnson can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find to be interesting.\n\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Johnson & Johnson recorded free cash flow worth 77% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.\n\nOur View\n\nJohnson & Johnson's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its EBIT growth rate. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that Johnson & Johnson takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson MedTech said it identified several factors that could lead to strokes like the ones that triggered a recall of the Biosense Webster division\u2019s Varipulse pulse field ablation ( PFA ) catheters.\n\nJ&J has updated its device instructions for use (IFU) in a correction that the FDA has labeled as a Class I recall, which means using the Varipulse catheter without following the updated instructions may cause serious injury or death. The recall does not require cardiac electrophysiologists to return or stop using the devices.\n\nInstead, the FDA and J&J (the world\u2019s second-largest medical device company, according to Medical Design & Outsourcing\u2019s Medtech Big 100 ranking) have directed physicians to familiarize themselves with the new instructions and review the findings from J&J\u2019s investigation. Those findings could also help other minimally invasive device developers as they design next-generation PFA systems.\n\nFirst look: Boston Scientific\u2019s next-gen Faraflex PFA and mapping catheter\n\n\u201cThe investigation into workflows used worldwide concludes that a greater number of ablations, stacking ablations and/or ablation outside of pulmonary veins may increases the risk of neurovascular event,\u201d Biosense Webster Senior Director of Quality & Compliance Maria Jose Arana wrote in a field safety notice to customers.\n\nJ&J Varipulse PFA catheter recall background\n\nPFA is a nonthermal method of cardiac ablation, designed to kill cardiomyocytes in the heart tissue to disrupt the errant electrical signals that cause atrial fibrillation (AFib) without damaging nearby nerves.\n\nJ&J\u2019s Varipulse won a CE mark for treating AFib in February 2024, followed by FDA approval in November 2024. In January 2025, J&J announced a pause in the use of Varipulse to investigate adverse neurovascular events in patients.\n\nIn February 2025, the company said the devices \u201coperate as intended\u201d and resumed cases, but offered an updated IFU and released details from its investigation (more on that below).\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first recall for J&J\u2019s Varipulse catheter. In April 2024, J&J recalled catheters due to a manufacturing issue that could increase the risk of cerebrovascular events like strokes.\n\nSpecifically, the polyurethane used to bind the Varipulse catheter to the electrodes overran the electrodes, which J&J said could increase the risk of irrigation hole blockage or electrode surface area reduction, which in turn could lead to a cerebrovascular event.\n\nAnother potential problem from that polyurethane overrun is polyurethane extending beyond the electrode\u2019s outside diameter, which J&J said \u201cmay cause interference with the sheath and variability in catheter performance or procedural delays.\u201d\n\nAt the time, J&J disclosed five reports of patients with symptoms after their ablation procedures, but said all procedures were successfully completed and the patients sent home.\n\nFor the more recent recall, J&J said four Varipulse cardiac ablation patients had a periprocedural stroke or transient ischemic attack (a TIA, also known as a mini-stroke). These patients were part of a limited group of 132 patients treated at U.S. hospitals between Dec. 10, 2024 and Jan. 3, 2025 for early feedback after FDA approval.\n\nThe patients with stroke or mini-stroke represented 3% of those limited cases, which was at least three times the expected rate for this kind of surgery. Less than 1% of all AFib ablation patients are expected to have a stroke or TIA, J&J said, noting that the worldwide rate of stroke and TIA for Varipulse patients is 0.5%\n\nThe FDA said J&J\u2019s investigation \u201cfound some differences between how the device was used and the recommendations in the use instructions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese differences could explain the higher risk of stroke or mini stroke and include treatment of patients with a more advanced form of irregular heart rhythm, more energy deliveries to the heart, repeated energy deliveries to the same location in the heart, and energy deliveries to locations not studied in clinical trials,\u201d the agency said.\n\nFactors that may contribute to strokes in J&J Varipulse PFA patients\n\nJ&J said its investigation found a potential for greater risk of stroke or TIA \u201cif a high number of ablations, the stacking of ablations, and/or ablations outside of the pulmonary veins are delivered.\u201d\n\nLooking into all reported cases of strokes or TIAs in Varipulse patients worldwide, J&J said 90% of the patients received more ablations than the median delivered in the InspIRE study (16), 60% of the patients received more ablations than the median delivered in the AdmIRE study (23), and 50% of the patients received more than 28 ablations.\n\nAnd in 70% of the global reports of Varipulse strokes or TIAs, J&J said the patients received ablations outside of their pulmonary veins. But J&J warned that the safety and efficacy of Varipulse outside of the pulmonary veins for AFib \u201chas not been clinically established and may increase the risk of patient injury.\u201d\n\nJ&J also warned of \u201cablation stacking.\u201d At least 35% of the patients who had strokes received stacked ablations, which J&J defined as \u201cwhen at least five electrodes are placed within a 3 mm distance of one another during consecutive complete ablations sessions.\u201d\n\nAblation stacking and/or a high number of ablations can contribute to heating that could increase the likelihood of char formation, J&J said. Char formation is burnt tissue on the electrodes or the heart tissue itself, which can cause a blood clot in the heart that could travel to the brain and cause a stroke. Low blood flow in a patient can also contribute to char.\n\nFinally, J&J warned that the Varipulse catheter and Varipulse generator were studied in the AdmIRE and InspIRE trials for patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but the safety and efficacy of their use to treat other arrhythmias have not been established.\n\nRead more: What is minimally invasive medtech?

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson told a judge its $9 billion proposal to settle baby powder cancer claims in bankruptcy court is the only viable way to end more than 15 years of litigation, while opponents assailed the company\u2019s efforts to line up support for its plan as deeply flawed.\n\n\u201cTime is off the essence,\u201d J&J\u2019s lawyer, Alli Brown, said Friday in her closing argument to win approval of the plan that would resolve tens of thousands of lawsuits alleging that asbestos-tainted talc in its iconic product has sickened users.\n\nWomen suffering from ovarian and other cancers are dying daily, Brown said. Conventional personal-injury mass litigation \u201chas shown us it\u2019s not a way to get a timely resolution.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for opponents of the plan said cancer victims \u201cweren\u2019t treated fairly and impartially\u201d in a pre-bankruptcy vote held last year to gauge support for J&J\u2019s settlement offer.\n\n\u201cThere were serious lapses here that justify having a re-vote,\u201d attorney Adam Silverstein told US Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez at the close of a trial in Houston. \u201cIt was a chaotic process that should not be endorsed.\u201d\n\nJohnson & Johnson is trying to use the bankruptcy process to close out the vast baby powder litigation after two earlier efforts failed in other courts. Lopez is navigating the intricacies of the law to determine whether J&J\u2019s efforts are proper.\n\nLopez heard about two weeks of testimony about whether J&J manipulated the pre-bankruptcy vote on the settlement and whether the company, which is profitable, is wrongly trying to benefit from Chapter 11 rules that should be reserved for financially distressed businesses.\n\nObjectors contend J&J made false and misleading statements in disclosures of the bankruptcy plan about whether J&J\u2019s talc-based baby powder was ever tainted with asbestos. Brown contested that during the trial, saying the company had \u201cnever wavered in the opinion that this product is safe and doesn\u2019t contain asbestos.\u201d\n\nJ&J says more than 80% of claimants voted to back the settlement and the company based its Red River Talc unit\u2019s fast-track bankruptcy case on that support. The company\u2019s lawyers said J&J clearly laid out the terms of its offers to current and future claimants and properly conducted the vote last summer.\n\nThe company\u2019s bankruptcy plan would pay an average of $120,000 to ovarian cancer claimants. Supporters of the offer say that\u2019s more than women have gotten through cases in the regular tort system.\n\nObjectors\u2019 complaints about the vote \u201csimply aren\u2019t credible\u201d reasons to invalidate the balloting, Brown said. J&J maintains that it would take 6,000 years to try all pending baby powder cases. The company pulled the talc-based version of the product worldwide in 2023.\n\nWhile most prominent mass-tort lawyers handling more than 60,000 baby powder suits filed so far favor the deal, a handful want Lopez to reject it. Opponents say J&J is improperly trying once again to use Chapter 11 to resolve the cases and improperly engineered the vote to push its settlement plan.\n\nSilverstein told the judge J&J\u2019s handling of the vote \u201cwasn\u2019t kosher.\u201d Foes of the plan say there were a series of miscues by the company hired to handle the balloting, including switching votes opposing the plan to the supporting column.\n\nFor his part, Lopez \u2013 who has handled several cases involving pre-bankruptcy votes \u2013 said he\u2019d \u201cnever seen a switch of votes\u201d in pre-packaged bankruptcies, but wasn\u2019t ready to sanction J&J over it.\n\nThe bankruptcy case is Red River Talc LLC, 24-90505, US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston).\n\nPhoto: Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nCopyright 2025 Bloomberg.",

            "content": "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson shared his thoughts on President Trump's heated Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in an interview with NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday. Moderator Kristen Welker asked Johnson what he thought about comments by Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2014a once staunch supporter of Ukraine on the Republican side\u2014in which he said that for Ukraine-Russia peace agreements to occur, Zelensky may need to resign.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWhat I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful and I don\u2019t know if we can ever do business with Zelensky again,\u201d Graham said on Friday. \"He [Zelensky] either needs to resign, and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\" Johnson seemed to agree that \u201csomething has to change\u201d in order for peace to occur. \u201cEither he [Zelensky] needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d Johnson told Welker. At the same time, Johnson maintained that Republicans do \u201cunderstand\u201d that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a \u201cdangerous adversary\u201d to the U.S., and that the U.S. is \u201cnot abandoning Ukraine.\u201d He also remained firm on his position that the potential U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal\u2014the discussion of which was the original intent of Trump and Zelensky\u2019s Oval Office meeting on Friday\u2014would be \u201ca win for everyone.\u201d\n\nJohnson continued: \u201cIt will give us access to rare earth minerals that we need, and it will provide a level of security for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson at the U.S. Capitol on Feb. 25, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Ricky Carioti/The Washington\u2014Getty Images\n\nThe discussion about Zelensky\u2019s leadership coincided with the Ukrainian leader's trip to London. After touching down on Saturday, he and other European leaders gathered for a summit on Sunday to discuss a path toward peace for Ukraine. On Sunday evening, Zelensky sat down with reporters at London Stansted Airport before leaving the U.K. He was asked by Sky News what he thought of Graham and Johnson's comments about him perhaps resigning. In response, Zelensky said Graham is a \"good guy,\" but went on to add: \"I can give [Graham] citizenship of Ukraine and he will become a citizen of our country. And then his voice will start to gain weight, and I will hear him as a citizen of Ukraine on the topic of who must be the President.\"\n\nHe added: \"The President of Ukraine will have to be chosen not in Lindsay Graham's home but in Ukraine.\" On the wider topic of resignation, Zelensky echoed comments he made at a press conference on Feb. 23\u2014prior to his and Trump\u2019s pivotal meeting, but amid rising tensions \u2014when he said he would be ready to resign if it guaranteed peace for Ukraine and he could do it in exchange for NATO. Reiterating that stance on Sunday, he said: \"I have said that I am exchanging for NATO membership, then it means I have fulfilled my mission. NATO means I have fulfilled my mission.\" Read More: World Leaders React to Zelensky and Trump\u2019s Oval Office Showdown In contrast to Graham and Johnson, some Republicans are uninterested in mentions of Zelensky resigning. Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford appeared separately on Meet The Press on Sunday, and said if Zelensky were to resign it would \u201cspiral Ukraine into chaos.\u201d He also showed an understanding of Zelensky\u2019s viewpoint, stating he was \u201crightfully concerned\u201d about Russian negotiations.\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not turning our back on Ukraine, nor should we,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cPutin is a murderous KGB thug that murders his political enemies and is a dictator.\u201d Other U.S. lawmakers to speak out against the mention of Zelensky resigning include Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who\u2014also on Meet the Press\u2014called Johnson\u2019s comments a \u201chorrific suggestion.\u201d \u201cZelensky is leading a country, trying to defend democracy against an authoritarian dictator, Putin, who invaded his country,\u201d Sanders said. In the aftermath of Trump\u2019s meeting with Zelensky, many European leaders have rallied behind Zelensky. Sunday's European leaders summit, led by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, considered short and long-term security plans for the country. \u201cI hope you know that we are all with you and the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes, everyone around this table,\u201d Starmer said to Zelensky at the summit, which was also attended by Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, during his opening remarks.\n\nStarmer went on to share that he and other European leaders will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting amid Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, and will then present that to the U.S.",

What Dawn Staley said about the decision\n\nCOLUMBIA \u2014 As the crowd honored South Carolina women's basketball redshirt junior Raven Johnson on Sunday, it began chanting three words.\n\n\"One more year,\" Colonial Life Arena roared.\n\nJohnson, who is part of the 2021 recruiting class with Bree Hall and Sania Feagin, tore an ACL in November of her freshman season and was given a redshirt year as a result. She's been with the program for four years but has played only three seasons, which gives her the option to return next year.\n\nCoach Dawn Staley said after the 78-66 win against No. 14 Kentucky (22-6, 11-5) that Johnson hasn't made a decision.\n\n\"It was a moment of joy, just hearing the people say 'one more year' but you never know, we'll have to wait and see,\" Johnson said when directly asked.\n\nThe No. 6 Gamecocks (26-3, 15-1 SEC) honor every senior each year during the last regular-season home game. Last season, Te-Hina Paopao walked out with her family and was honored but returned for her fifth season. Former starting center Kamilla Cardoso had the choice to return for this season but opted to declare for the WNBA draft and ended up being the No. 3 overall pick.\n\n\"Classy touch by the fams (nickname for South Carolina's fan),\" Staley said of the chants. \"For me, it's a personal choice, so I'm not going to push her either way. I'm just going to let her and her family decide what they want to do. Obviously Raven make us a better basketball team. Raven is a winner. She comes back, it increases our chances of winning a lot more basketball games.

            "content": "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Sunday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country\u201d for Ukraine to continue pursuing a peace deal negotiated by the United States.\n\nHis comments come just two days after President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Zelenskyy publicly sparred in the Oval Office while the Ukrainian president visited Washington to finish negotiations on a deal over Ukraine\u2019s mineral wealth.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is trying to get these two parties to a point of peace,\u201d Johnson said during an interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d adding: \u201cWhat President Zelenskyy did in the White House was effectively signal to us that he\u2019s not ready for that yet, and I think that\u2019s a great disappointment.\u201d\n\nJohnson emphasized that Trump \u201chas been very clear about this \u2014 that if [Zelenskyy] is ready for peace, then we can negotiate a deal.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy has repeatedly said he was seeking to include security guarantees \u2014 or assurances that the United States would come to Ukraine\u2019s aid if Russia violates a ceasefire deal \u2014 in the mineral rights agreement.\n\nIn the Oval Office spat, Trump told Zelenskyy that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the cards\u201d to negotiate and joined Vance in asking him to be more grateful for U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\nFollowing the contentious meeting, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called on Zelenskyy to resign, telling reporters at the White House that the meeting was a \"complete, utter disaster.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again,\" Graham said, adding that he \"either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d\n\nJohnson on Sunday echoed the president and the vice president, telling \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker that Zelenskyy \u201cberated and interrupted his host, instead of expressing gratitude for the extraordinary help that the U.S. has provided his country.\u201d\n\nJohnson also argued that security guarantees were inherent in the mineral rights deal, telling Welker, \u201cThis mineral rights deal is a win, a win for everyone. It will give us access to rare earth minerals that we need, and it will provide a level of security for Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will effectively be in an economic partnership with us after that point, and we will definitely always defend our interests and our investments,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cRussia knows that. China knows that. Iran, North Korea know that, and that\u2019s a very important message for us.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Putin was the \"winner\" in the fallout from the tense Oval Office exchange, Johnson said, \"No, he wasn't.\"\n\nIn an interview later on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., pushed back on GOP officials\u2019 calls for Zelenskyy to resign, telling Welker, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in calling on the resignation of other world leaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrankly, I think that would spiral Ukraine into chaos right now, trying to find who is the negotiator\u201d for a peace deal, Lankford added.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also pushed back against the call for Zelenskyy to resign, calling it a \"horrific suggestion\" on \"Meet the Press\" later Sunday.\n\n\"Zelenskyy is leading a country trying to defend democracy against an authoritarian dictator \u2014 Putin \u2014 who invaded his country,\" Sanders said.\n\nJohnson also spoke about the massive budget reconciliation bill that House Republicans passed last week, which now heads to a group of House and Senate GOP leaders as they seek to reconcile the differences between the House and Senate versions on the bill.\n\nHouse Republicans\u2019 bill includes $2 trillion in spending cuts, which some opponents of the measure say could affect Medicaid funding, affecting health care and insurance for millions of low-income and disabled people.\n\nJohnson said Sunday that House Republicans did not intend to touch Medicaid funding in the budget bill, telling Welker, \u201cDon\u2019t take my word for it, Kristen. Go do a word search of the budget resolution that we passed on Tuesday. There is not one mention of Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people want us to review the expenditures of the country and get our fiscal house in order, and that\u2019s what we must do,\u201d Johnson said, adding that House Republicans also want to extend Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts measure, which expires this year.\n\n\u201cWe can do both of those things simultaneously and not affect benefits for anyone who relies upon those and is eligible to receive them,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nOn Friday, Trump adviser and tech mogul Elon Musk made several false claims about Social Security, signaling that he would seek to evaluate the agency for cuts in the future.\n\nAsked whether Social Security is Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s next target, Johnson told Welker, \u201cI\u2019ve met with Elon about this multiple times. We meet late into the night in his office, and we\u2019ve looked at that. What he\u2019s finding with his algorithms crawling through the data of Social Security system is enormous amounts of fraud, waste and abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a moral responsibility to ensure that those programs are conducted in a way that does not allow for this, this massive fraud and abuse, and that\u2019s what he is finding,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nSanders said in an interview on \u201cMeet the Press, \"I think what Musk, the wealthiest guy in the world, just said is totally outrageous.\"\n\n\"That's a hell of a 'Ponzi scheme,'\" Sanders said, referring to what Musk called Social Security on Friday, \"when for the last 80 years, Social Security has paid out every nickel owed to every eligible American.\"",

            "content": "On Saturday, February 22, one of America\u2019s great civil rights and labor activists was laid to rest in Greensboro, North Carolina. It\u2019s possible you haven\u2019t heard of Reverend Nelson Johnson, though Reverend Dr. William Barber II, the dynamic founder of Repairers of the Breach, the \u201cco-anchor\u201d of the new Poor People\u2019s Campaign, and professor of the practice of public theology and public policy, places him (and his wife Joyce Johnson) in the rank of \u201cHarriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, Mother Jones and Martin Luther King Jr.\u201d It\u2019s salient in this moment, too, that the social, racial, and economic rifts that sparked the 1979 Greensboro Massacre and claimed the lives of five of Reverend Johnson\u2019s fellow activists\u2014scarring him for life\u2014continue to divide our country today.\n\nHis clarifying insistence on truth telling will be sorely missed during a time when people are being threatened, demonized, and fired for telling American history\u2019s multiple truths. Given this, it\u2019s imperative to correct the historical errors and omissions in a recent New York Times obituary for Reverend Johnson.\n\nThe obituary reports that when, just prior to the November 3, 1979 murders, a caravan of Ku Klux Klansmen and American Nazis arrived at the start of a march Nelson Johnson and his fellow communists were mounting against racism, the police were \u201cstanding nearby.\u201d This isn\u2019t true. The police were, by official order, absent and out of sight and therefore unable to stop the approaching violence. What makes this particularly alarming is that at least three law enforcement agencies\u2014the Greensboro Police Department, the FBI, and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms\u2014had elicited enough information from informants and infiltrators to stop the white supremacist attack before it happened. Every serious investigation of the November 3, 1979 events over the last quarter century acknowledges this.\n\nWhen the facts of the Greensboro Massacre are presented clearly, it\u2019s easy to see how the white power politics, law enforcement bias, and political opportunism that led to that tragedy illuminate the time we are in.\n\nKlansmen and Nazis inflicting violence on African Americans, Jews, Catholics, Latinos, Native Americans and left activists is a horrific though unsurprising fact of American history. However, we must not omit from this history the responsibility of the public officials charged with protecting and serving all our citizens. The very foundation of our democratic system rests on the implicit and explicit trust we place in state officials and institutions to protect us in situations like the one that led to the Greensboro Massacre.\n\nThe Greensboro Massacre reminds us, as we are being reminded again today, that the only way to preserve that trust is to hold officials accountable when they betray it and commit crimes. Sadly, our justice system did not find the vigilante white supremacists or complicit officers of the law criminally responsible for the November 3, 1979 murders. Only a federal civil suit brought a sliver of justice to the tragedy. The New York Times obituary notes the civil judgement that found eight defendants liable for death but does not tell readers who they were: Five were Klansmen and Nazis, one was a police informant (and former FBI informant), and two were Greensboro police officers. This judgement reminds us that we must continuously resist the influence of reactionary white supremacist politics in our law enforcement agencies and justice system.\n\nThe obituary concludes with the installation of the 2015 North Carolina state historical marker commemorating the massacre. Left unreported, however, is the tenacious and hopeful work, not only by Reverend Johnson, but by Greensboro\u2019s civil society, to set their history right. Thanks to these groundbreaking efforts, which included a two-year Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the City of Greensboro offered two apologies for the massacre: one in 2017, following the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, and another in 2020, in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder. This second apology explicitly acknowledged that the Greensboro Police Department could have prevented the violence on November 3, 1979. Movingly, the city established a scholarship fund in the names of the five slain activists.\n\nWhen the facts of the Greensboro Massacre are presented clearly, it\u2019s easy to see how the white power politics, law enforcement bias, and political opportunism that led to that tragedy illuminate the time we are in.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember, however, that Reverend Johnson\u2019s historical significance is far greater than the trauma of November 3, 1979. His 60 years of racial and economic justice activism may be seen as an essential bridge, spanning from the revolutionary visions of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X to Dr. William Barber\u2019s current mobilizations on behalf of our nation\u2019s poor. Like both these leaders, Johnson saw race and economics as inextricably linked. And like them, he never stopped trying to fix the root causes of inequality in America for all people suffering predatory capitalism. He came to consider demonizing others, even one\u2019s enemies, as a mistake. That revelation would lead him away from communism to liberation theology and the idea of revolutionary, Christian love. This philosophical shift, however, didn\u2019t transform Johnson from radical to reformer; he never stopped believing that true equality and justice in the United States will only come with fundamental changes to our values, our institutions, and our economy.\n\nReverend Johnson\u2019s community-based work has inspired labor and racial justice leaders all around the country. Though his name might not, until now, have been known widely, his work with unions and churches and social justice organizations has been buttressing grassroots democracy for decades.\n\nThe life of this big-hearted farm kid from the Airlie, North Carolina expands the geography, timeline, and scope of the conventional civil rights story. Getting his story right broadens our understanding of American history\u2019s lessons, affirms a powerful faith in equal justice and democracy, embraces the power of community, and rejects the repression of our country\u2019s truths.",

J&J\u2019s internal testing confirmed this in the 1970s, but the company chose to hide this information from the public to protect its profits.\n\nAs a result, consumers across the country may have been exposed to asbestos and put at risk of developing cancer.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other psychedelic stocks.\n\nThe Therapeutic Potential and Investment Boom in Psychedelic Medicine\n\nIn contrast to drugs like cocaine or marijuana, psychedelics are strong and give users access to a kind of \"alternate reality.\" One class of hallucinogenic substances that can produce unusual states of consciousness is psychedelics. LSD and chemicals originating from plants are among the many chemical substances included in this class. Psychedelics have the power to change or heighten feelings, thoughts, and energy levels, which frequently leads to spiritual experiences. They are divided into two primary categories: serotonergic chemicals (like LSD) and empathogens and dissociative drugs (like PCP). These medications are being investigated for therapeutic uses in addition to recreational ones, and they have shown promise in the treatment of several illnesses, including opiate addiction, severe depressive disorders, treatment-resistant depression, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nThe revival of interest in psychedelics has been greatly aided by venture capital investors. Startups in this sector saw a spike in investor interest around the beginning of 2020, which was dubbed the \"psychedelic renaissance.\" On February 16, 2023, Clara Burtenshaw, a partner at Neo Kuma Ventures, the biggest European venture capital fund specializing in psychedelic investments, shared her excitement about psychedelic healthcare, saying:\n\n\u201cPsychedelic healthcare is a very exciting area because it\u2019s this apex of drugs, clinics, and experimental treatments.\u201d\n\nGrowth and Promise of the Psychedelic Drugs Market\n\nMany psychedelic-focused pharmaceutical businesses are working to have their medications approved by the government. Psilocybin and other hallucinogens are showing great promise in treating disorders including schizophrenia and depression. The US psychedelic drugs market is projected to grow from $4.51 billion in 2025 to $15.62 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of 16.8%. This growth is part of a larger global trend, with the worldwide market expected to reach $11.93 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 16.9%.\n\nPsilocybin (magic mushrooms) is the most widely used psychedelic drug in the United States, with an estimated 8 million American adults using it in 2023, according to a survey conducted by RAND Corporation. Around 12% of respondents reported lifetime use, and 3.1% used it in the past year. LSD use has also risen significantly, particularly among individuals aged 18-25, with usage increasing from 0.9% in 2002 to 4% in 2019. The LSD market is projected to grow from $145.9 million in 2024 to $265.7 million by 2034. MDMA, although not providing specific usage data, remains popular, especially in research for PTSD treatment. Ketamine has gained attention for its depression treatment potential, particularly with the FDA approval of Spravato nasal spray.",

            "content": "I found myself in the Ray Johnson archive by accident. Last December, I attended a screening of How to Draw a Bunny (2002), Andrew L. Moore and John Walter\u2019s haunting, fascinating documentary about the elusive figure once described as \u201cNew York\u2019s most famous unknown artist\u201d (the titular proposition, Johnson explains with characteristic deadpan, is \u201cbasically very simple. You draw a circle and add some ears\u201d). I was still thinking about Ray the next afternoon, as I wandered down Sixty-Ninth Street. So it felt like one of his own trademark coincidences when\u2014having entered David Zwirner Gallery to see a selection of Noah Davis\u2019s collages\u2014I spotted a brass plaque directing me up another flight of stairs to the floor where Johnson\u2019s estate headquarters. Shelves are filled with his books; his cut-ups and collages crowd the walls; a bust, half its face covered with Johnson\u2019s signature bunny head, perches precariously in a corner. I couldn\u2019t help but remember a scene at the end of How to Draw a Bunny, in which Johnson\u2019s friends enter his home shortly after his body was discovered off the coast of Sag Harbor, Long Island (he had been spotted, on January 13, 1995, diving off a bridge and backstroking out to sea). They move slowly through a forest of cardboard boxes, neatly arranged in a grid-like maze. Deep among the thickets of archival ephemera\u2014the only artwork left visible\u2014is an enormous photo of a smiling Johnson, propped outwards in greeting, as if to say, \u201cYou found me.\u201d\n\nJohnson reveled in chance, in jokes, in surprise, in disappearance. He evaded personal questions, and preferred his work to be discovered by serendipity than by design: perhaps by bumping into him on the street with a box of collages under one arm, or receiving a grubby envelope through the post, name Sharpied under the line \u201cPlease send to.\u201d Ellen Levy\u2019s A Book about Ray\u2014in her words, less a \u201clife story\u201d than an \u201cart story\u201d\u2014 takes its cue from Johnson\u2019s intuitive way of working, unfolding through association instead of strict chronology. The approach is ideally fitted to her subject: this is not an attempt to pin Johnson down, but a rich portrait shaped by his own repeated self-reinventions.\n\nBorn in Detroit, Michigan, in 1927, Johnson studied with Josef Albers at Black Mountain College, and moved to New York in 1949. He focused on abstract painting until 1958, when he took his canvases to his friend Cy Twombly\u2019s home and destroyed them all. Over the rest of his life, destruction became a powerful mode and theme for Johnson: a self-negating impulse which, paradoxically, was vital to his sense of identity. He showed in various exhibitions over the years, but withdrew from the commercial gallery scene altogether in 1980, becoming increasingly, stubbornly reclusive. More than once, he publicly announced his own death\u2014an ambiguous act, like much of his work, revealing a simultaneous desire for publicity and obliteration.\n\nAfter 1958, Johnson\u2019s media leaned to the ephemeral. His main form was \u201cmoticos\u201d (a word he invented): small missives, usually formed of collage and drawings\u2014often featuring cartoon figures, brand advertisements, shapes, pin-ups, puns, and gags\u2014which he posted to friends, sometimes with instructions to embellish or pass on. \u201cRay Johnson plays the US mail like a harp,\u201d said a friend: the post, to Johnson, was both system and medium, as integral a holding structure for his collages as the box was for Joseph Cornell\u2019s assemblages. He called his network the \u201cNew York Correspondance School,\u201d elegantly positing letter-exchange as a choreographed motion. The idea of a network, expanding across time and place, was key to both the form and distribution of Johnson\u2019s work: a favorite style was the grid filled with names, creating visual and social associations between friends (Robert Rauschenberg, John Cage), influences (Gertrude Stein, the Nancy comic strip), and icons (Shelley Duvall, Joan Crawford, Marilyn Monroe). He was fascinated by celebrity, but also by names in the phone book. \u201cSince I cut everything up,\u201d he explained, \u201cthey\u2019re all people in a kaleidoscope.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s methods were ad hoc\u2014he enlisted friends with access to mailrooms and photocopiers\u2014and his work, writes Levy, was \u201cat once the output of a systematized network and a satire on such systematization.\u201d He would post small pieces to the MoMA librarians, aware that all correspondence was deposited in the museum\u2019s archive, yet continually thwarted the efforts of dealers who tried to court him. When the curators of a 1970 group exhibition at the Whitney asked how he would like his work installed, Johnson replied that he rather liked how they were packed in the storage room, encased in crates and boxes. \u201cWe\u2019ll have Nothing in the show,\u201d he told a prospective gallerist. Ruth Asawa, a fellow student at Black Mountain, once told him about \u201cthe Taoist philosophy of nothingness being everything-ness,\u201d an idea which captured Johnson\u2019s imagination. Levy situates his work\u2014which also encompassed enigmatic performances, called \u201cNothings,\u201d held in spaces around the city\u2014in dialogue with Rauschenberg\u2019s series of \u201cWhite Paintings\u201d (1951) or Cage\u2019s 4\u201933 (1952), pieces which embraced the idea of nothing-ness, as well as Andy Warhol\u2019s Brillo Boxes (1964), work which constantly questioned its own status as art.\n\nIt\u2019s an ambivalence that characterized Johnson\u2019s outlook, his way of moving through the world, and his legacy. Johnson was both an insider and an outsider: supremely well-connected in New York\u2019s avant-garde scene, he preferred to keep his audience at a distance; eager for fame, but fiercely private and (after leaving the city for Long Island in 1968) increasingly reclusive; maker of infinitely reproducible work for a broad public, who conspired to keep his pieces out of view; sought-after by collectors, but unwilling to compromise for the market. When one buyer asked for a discount on a collage, he received the piece with the same percentage chopped off. On another occasion, Johnson threatened a collector whose silhouette he had traced that if he didn\u2019t pay up he would add an image of Paloma Picasso to the portrait. \u201cHer head will appear next to yours, or as a larger head containing your head.\u201d\n\nRay Johnson\u2019s version of the art world, Levy writes, was \u201can always unstable mix of public sphere and private enterprise.\u201d Problems ensued when those worlds merged. Yet for Johnson, who coined the phrase \u201cflop art,\u201d failure\u2014which is to say, failure to assimilate into the conventional structures of art production, display, or sale\u2014was a kind of success. One friend described him as a \u201cliving sculpture\u201d: constantly in motion, alive, witty, contradictory, containing multitudes. Beautifully and copiously illustrated, Levy\u2019s book serves not only as a narrative of this intriguing, still mysterious life but also as a kind of archive of Johnson\u2019s body of work: a treasure trove as surprising, multi-layered and erudite as its trickster subject.\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen Levy\u2019s A Book about Ray was published by MIT Press in October 2024.",

Everyone from Mr. Trump on down was pleading with Ms. Greene not to do it, but there was no political downside to her forging ahead.\n\nSo Mr. Johnson needed to make Ms. Greene feel heard. He would vent to donors and colleagues that he spent half his days as speaker and the other half as a mental health counselor. Because of his tiny majority, he explained, he could not afford to be at odds with anyone. So he spent countless hours \u201con the couch\u201d with restive Republicans, listening and gently encouraging them to get back on the team.\n\nMr. Johnson viewed Ms. Greene, in particular, as more sympathetic to Mr. Putin than anyone he knew. He felt strongly that what he was trying to do was right and some days, he would come home and joke with his wife: \u201cSure, you\u2019re supposed to bless those who persecute you, but every hour of every day?\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson wanted to convince Ms. Greene and other Republican holdouts that the briefings he sat through were accurate. Mr. Putin was a threat who could potentially steamroll across Europe after taking Ukraine and threaten one of America\u2019s NATO allies. To those who did not agree, he offered briefings on the intelligence that had persuaded him that Ukraine needed American help. No one ever showed up to receive them.\n\nMr. Johnson ultimately moved the bill and survived politically, thanks to Democrats\u2019 blocking of Ms. Greene\u2019s motion to oust him. He was elected again as speaker in January, with a hefty assist from Mr. Trump.",

            "content": "It can be difficult to decide which dividend stocks to buy. After all, more than 5,700 of them trade on U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nHowever, three Motley Fool contributors think they can make the decisions easier. They believe that three dividend stocks are no-brainer buys right now -- and all three are big healthcare stocks. Here's why they picked Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.34%), Novartis (NVS -0.06%), and Pfizer (PFE 0.37%).\n\nLook beyond the legal and regulatory troubles\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Johnson & Johnson): There is no denying that Johnson & Johnson has an incredible dividend record. The company has raised its payouts for 62 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King. However, some might argue the stock is no longer a good pick for income investors. Johnson & Johnson has encountered legal troubles in the form of thousands of lawsuits regarding its talc-based products, which, some plaintiffs allege, gave them cancer.\n\nThat's on top of the U.S. government's newly acquired regulatory authority to negotiate the prices of certain drugs. Some of Johnson & Johnson's medicines have already been targeted, and it will result in lower revenue for the company from these products.\n\nHowever, Johnson & Johnson remains a no-brainer dividend stock. Despite its legal issues, it has maintained its AAA rating from Standard & Poor, the highest credit rating available, and a sign of the strength of its balance sheet. Johnson & Johnson can take care of its financial obligations. That's the clear message. Further, the drugmaker has moved closer to solving its legal issues with a proposed solution via a subsidiary that will put more than 99% of these lawsuits to bed.\n\nMost plaintiffs are already on board, so even if it isn't a done deal, it's moving in that direction. Lastly, Johnson & Johnson should succeed in navigating the new regulatory regime in the U.S. For one, the company has a strong medical device unit that grants it some diversification. It isn't solely dependent on its pharmaceutical business. Second, Johnson & Johnson has survived and thrived through many regulatory changes that directly affected its business over 100 years of history.\n\nExpect the company to find ways to get around this issue in the long run. In short, Johnson & Johnson's underlying business remains strong -- and its dividend program about as safe as they come -- despite its recent headwinds. The stock is still an excellent pick for income-oriented investors.\n\nNovartis is a dependable, high-yielding stock to own for years\n\nDavid Jagielski (Novartis): Swiss pharma stock Novartis pays a high yield, offers steady growth, and is priced reasonably, making it a potential ideal option for income-seeking investors. At 3.5%, its dividend yield is more than twice the S&P 500 average of 1.3%. The company has increased its payout for 28 straight years and with a payout ratio of around 64%, there's still room for even more rate hikes in the future, especially as Novartis' growth continues.\n\nWhat's appealing about the business is that it's going after sustainable and modest single-digit growth of around 5% per year, through to 2029 (at constant exchange rates); it isn't taking on big risks and swinging for the fences. The company has a robust pipeline with more than 100 projects ongoing, spanning multiple therapeutic areas, including oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and others. Meanwhile, the business already has many high-growth products in its portfolio, including heart medication Entresto, which generated 31% revenue growth last year.\n\nNovartis may not be the flashiest stock, but that can make it an underrated buy as it trades at just 13 times its projected future earnings (based on analyst forecasts). With a modest valuation, investors are getting a good margin of safety with the stock while locking in a fairly high yield. If you're a dividend investor in search of a high payout that's safe and growing, Novartis looks like a no-brainer buy right now.\n\nAn ultra-high-yield dividend stock that's a bargain\n\nKeith Speights (Pfizer): You won't find many dividend stocks in the healthcare sector with a juicier dividend than Pfizer. The big drugmaker's forward dividend yield is an ultra-high 6.5%. Is this dividend in jeopardy of being cut? Nope. Pfizer's management plans to maintain and grow the dividend payout.\n\nI think Pfizer will be able to deliver on this commitment. The company already has a solid track record of dividends -- 345 consecutive quarterly dividend payments and 16 years in a row of increasing the dividend.\n\nMore importantly, Pfizer should have the products needed to generate sufficient free cash flow to keep the dividends flowing and growing. Sure, the company's COVID-19 sales have plunged. And, yes, Pfizer faces a looming patent cliff with several top-selling products losing exclusivity. However, the big drugmaker also has multiple strong growth drivers, notably including cancer drugs Adcetris and Padcev and migraine therapy Nurtec ODT.\n\nThere's another reason to buy Pfizer stock in addition to its fantastic dividend, though: valuation. Pfizer's shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.07. Its price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a super-low 0.18, according to LSEG. If Pfizer can deliver only modest growth (which I think it can), this ultra-high-yield dividend stock is a bona fide bargain.",

            "content": "This article originally ran on Feb. 15, 2025. It was updated on Feb. 28 with additional information from the FDA about the Class I recall.\n\nJohnson & Johnson MedTech (NYSE: JNJ) + announced that it intends to resume the rollout of its Varipulse platform in the U.S. after a temporary pause.\n\nLast month, the medtech giant said it temporarily halted all U.S. cases using its Varipulse pulsed field ablation (PFA) system. It attributed the pause to an investigation of the root cause of four reported neurovascular events in a U.S. External Evaluation. A special configuration of the U.S. platform meant the issue did not extend to commercial Varipulse activity outside the U.S.\n\nAnalysts said the company \u201cpaused sales of its Varipulse PFA system due to reports of strokes with the device.\u201d They cited a report of a stroke in the FDA\u2019s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. That indicated that a patient experienced a stroke following Varipulse treatment. The analysts said at least two additional patients had strokes following Varipulse procedures in Europe.\n\nLate Feb. 14, the company said it planned to resume its limited U.S. Varipulse rollout after an investigation \u201cfound the devices operate as intended.\u201d Johnson & Johnson MedTech plans to update the Varipulse catheter\u2019s instructions for use globally to include enhanced guidance.\n\nThe investigation looked at potential device-, procedure- and patient-related factors. It found no difference in performance of the available Varipulse configurations globally. The company said it found the potential for neurovascular events to increase as a result of the delivery of a high number of ablations, the stacking of ablations, and/or ablations outside of the pulmonary veins.\n\nJohnson & Johnson MedTech said it continues communications with healthcare professionals to recommend they review and adhere to the updated instructions and share the information with patients.\n\n\u201cVaripulse is an important treatment option for patients with atrial fibrillation and remains available in all markets where commercially launched,\u201d the company concluded.\n\nFDA releases more details about the issues that led to the initial pause\n\nIn a Feb. 28 notice, the FDA outlined updated instructions for use released by Johnson & Johnson related to the Varipulse system. The instructions direct users to determine whether the balance of risk and benefits support using the device, considering the patient\u2019s individual situation, with the known and inherent risk of neurovascular events.\n\nJohnson & Johnson updated the instructions due to a high rate of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA or \u201cmini stroke), the FDA said. These risks were seen in the first 132 procedures after FDA approval in November 2024. The FDA said the company limited its distribution to a few U.S. hospitals to get more feedback.\n\nOf the 132 patients treated during this limited evaluation, four patients (approximately 3%) had a stroke or mini stroke shortly after surgery. This exceeded the frequency expected for this type of surgery (typically 1% or less) according to the FDA.\n\nThe company investigated the surgeries that resulted in these events and found some differences between how the device was used and the recommendations in the use instructions. These differences could explain the higher risk of stroke or mini stroke and include treatment of patients with a more advanced form of irregular heart rhythm, more energy deliveries to the heart, repeated energy deliveries to the same location in the heart, and energy deliveries to locations not studied in clinical trials.\n\nBased on the available data that may link these differences to stroke or mini stroke, the company recommends using the device only as studied, which is reflected in the updated use instructions.\n\nJohnson & Johnson also plans to conduct a U.S. Post-Approval Study. This will further investigate the benefits and risks associated with the use of the Varipulse ablation catheter for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\n\nRead more: J&J MedTech\u2019s Varipulse PFA recall investigation finds potential stroke factors\n\nMore about the Johnson & Johnson MedTech Varipulse system\n\nThe Varipulse platform treats AFib with a single device that combines PFA with the Carto 3 mapping system. Its variable-loop, multi-electrode Varipulse catheter uses laser-cut nitinol tubing for its loop shape. The platform also includes TruPulse generator and the Carto 3 3D cardiac mapping system.\n\nJ&J joined Medtronic and Boston Scientific as companies with PFA technologies approved for treating AFib when it received an FDA nod in November.\n\nThe company reported more than 130 cases with Varipulse in the U.S. since it began external evaluation. Those took place across 14 sites and 40 operators. Globally, it reported more than 3,000 commercial cases with Varipulse.\n\nMedtronic\u2019s PulseSelect PFA system became the first to win FDA approval for AFib in 2023. Boston Scientific followed with its Farapulse system in January. Medtronic added to its offerings in October with an FDA nod for its Affera mapping and ablation system with the Sphere-9 catheter.\n\nAt the time of the Varipulse pause, analysts said they expected Boston Scientific and Medtronic to benefit if their systems don\u2019t have similar issues.\n\n\u201cThis news makes us more positive on [Boston Scientific] since our recent downgrade mainly centered on the competitive risk posed by both the [Medtronic] and [Johnson & Johnson] PFA product launches.\u201d\n\nThey also suggested potential issues even when Varipulse sales resume.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear how long the Varipulse sales will remain paused, but even if [Johnson & Johnson] allows sales to be resumed, we believe that the product is now likely to be tainted and that electrophysiologists are likely to be wary of using it,\u201d the analysts wrote.",

            "content": "The Capitol Hill townhouse is owned by a major Republican donor. It\u2019s the headquarters of a little-known political influence project that has reached a number of powerful Republican politicians.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published.\n\nIn 2021, Steve Berger, an evangelical pastor who has attacked the separation of church and state as \u201ca delusional lie\u201d and called multinational institutions \u201cdemonic,\u201d set off on an ambitious project. His stated goal: minister to members of Congress so that what \u201cthey learn is then translated into policy.\u201d His base of operations would be a six-bedroom, $3.7 million townhouse blocks from the U.S. Capitol.\n\nRecently, the pastor scored a remarkable coup for a political influence project that has until now managed to avoid public scrutiny. He got a new roommate.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has been staying at the home since around the beginning of this year, according to interviews and videos obtained by ProPublica.\n\nThe house is owned by a major Republican donor and Tennessee car magnate who has joined Berger in advocating for and against multiple bills before Congress.\n\nPastor Steve Berger, left, with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Johnson\u2019s wife, Kelly, in what appears to be the Capitol Hill home the two men have been sharing Credit: via Facebook\n\nOver the past four years, Berger and his wife, Sarah Berger, have dedicated themselves to what they call their D.C. \u201cministry center.\u201d In addition to Johnson, who is an evangelical conservative, the pastor has built close relationships with several other influential conservative politicians. Dan Bishop, now nominated for a powerful post in the Trump White House, seems to have also lived in the home last year while he was still a congressman, according to three people.\n\nA spokesperson for Johnson said that the speaker \u201cpays fair market value in monthly rent for the portion of the Washington, D.C. townhome that he occupies.\u201d He did not answer a question about how much Johnson is paying. House ethics rules allow members of Congress to live anywhere, as long as they are paying fair-market rent.\n\nThe spokesperson added that Johnson \u201chas never once spoken to Mr. Berger about any piece of legislation or any matter of public policy.\u201d Berger and Bishop did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Bergers have described their mission as galvanizing political allies to take action. \u201cIt\u2019s just iron sharpening iron,\u201d Sarah Berger said on a podcast last summer, explaining the couple\u2019s approach to political influence. \u201cLike, \u2018Oh yeah, that\u2019s why I\u2019m standing firm on this policy.\u2019\u201d\n\nSteve Berger claims to have personally spurred legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s a humbling thing,\u201d he said in a sermon in late 2022. \u201cYou get a text message from a senator that says: \u2018Thank you for your inspiration. Because it has caused me now to create a bill that is going to further righteousness in this country.\u2019\u201d\n\nBerger\u2019s interests extend beyond his staunch social conservatism. He and the donor who owns the house, Lee Beaman, have publicly advocated together for numerous specific policy changes, including a bill that would make it easier to fire federal employees and a regulation that would reduce fuel efficiency standards for the automotive industry. After the 2020 election, they both signed a letter declaring that President Donald Trump was the rightful winner and calling for Congress to overturn the results.\n\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, did not respond to questions about how he ended up staying at the home. Beaman did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe earliest date ProPublica was able to confirm Johnson being at the Berger house was in mid-December. A video reviewed by ProPublica shows Johnson visiting the home on Dec. 15 with two women who appear to be his wife and daughter. They lingered outside before entering, while Johnson pointed around the building and down to the basement entrance as if he was giving a tour. Two days later, Berger sent a note to his supporters on social media: \u201cI so wish I could tell you all the massive doors that broke open this week.\u201d\n\nSince the beginning of the year, videos and interviews show, Johnson has regularly left the house in the morning and returned in the evening. One day that Johnson was there recently, Berger was also at the home, opening the front door barefoot in pajama bottoms. (It appears Johnson may primarily be staying in the home\u2019s two-bedroom basement.)\n\nWashington pieds-\u00e0-terre can prove a significant expense for members of Congress as they split time between the capital and their home districts. Johnson is less wealthy than many other lawmakers. He worked at conservative nonprofits before he entered public service, and on his most recent financial disclosure form he did not declare a single asset. When Johnson was elevated to the speakership in 2023, news reports indicated that rather than renting an apartment, he might be sleeping in his office. (Lawmakers must report debts, income and many financial holdings on disclosure forms but aren\u2019t required to list living expenses like rent.)\n\nThe Berger home is in an upscale D.C. neighborhood full of lobbyists and corporate attorneys. Though it\u2019s not clear what the home\u2019s basement would fetch on the open market, it\u2019s not unusual for two-bedrooms in the area to rent for as much as $7,000 a month. Discounts on rent are generally prohibited by House ethics rules as improper gifts, experts said.\n\nIn sermons and on social media, Berger has mentioned some of the topics he\u2019s discussed with Johnson and other members of Congress. Last year, Berger, a passionate supporter of the Israeli right-wing, said he\u2019d had \u201ca great conversation\u201d with the speaker about Israel.\n\nAn Instagram post from Pastor Steve Berger Credit: via Instagram\n\nRecently, Johnson has described his conversations with Trump to the pastor, according to Berger. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Berger said in a sermon that he\u2019d advised \u201csome congressmen\u201d to see the conflict through the lens of Ezekiel 38 and 39, parts of the Bible some see as prophesying a great war before the Second Coming. He did not specify what that meant from a policy perspective.\n\nAn energetic 60-year-old with a white goatee and penchant for preaching in sneakers and jeans, Berger has strong views on a wide range of issues, including economic policy and public health. He is vehemently opposed to the World Health Organization, which Trump moved to withdraw the U.S. from last month, and recently predicted that COVID-19 vaccines will result in \u201cyoung people dropping dead all over the place.\u201d He attacked the World Economic Forum at length in a recent sermon, accusing it of \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of COVID-19 \u201cto implement their satanic plot.\u201d\n\nBerger is also against same-sex marriage, saying \u201cit opens the door to all manner of sexual depravity and wickedness\u201d \u2014 though he has said he has \u201cfriends who are practicing homosexuals, people I care about.\u201d He opposes homosexuality and \u201cheterosexual sin\u201d in equal measures, he\u2019s said, referring to acts like watching pornography and sex between unmarried adults.\n\nBerger\u2019s operation is organized as a nonprofit called Ambassador Services International, which runs on a budget of around $1 million per year, according to tax filings. The home where it is registered in Washington \u2014 and where Johnson has been staying \u2014 was purchased in early 2021. Once the home of abolitionist Frederick Douglass and later housing the Smithsonian Museum of African Art, it was advertised at the time as a \u201cfour-level Second Empire-style townhouse of impeccable elegance and exceptional scale,\u201d offering \u201cbespoke tranquility in a coveted location.\u201d\n\nThe buyer was Crockett Ventures LLC. Corporate filings show its sole owner is Beaman, the donor and businessman, who built a fortune on a chain of car dealerships started by his father. He has given millions to Republican political groups, including large donations to the Trump campaign and political committees for the Heritage Foundation and the House Freedom Caucus. He\u2019s also served as the treasurer of a congressional campaign.\n\nBeaman was once so fed up with the restrictions that came with owning a home on a \u201cgovernment-controlled lake\u201d that he bought a sprawling property with a 50-acre private lake of its own, according to a profile in an architecture book. He became a fixture of Nashville media in recent years because of sordid allegations made by his fourth wife during their divorce, including that he made her watch what he called \u201ctraining films\u201d of him having sex with a prostitute. Beaman\u2019s lawyers wrote at the time that his wife\u2019s filing contained \u201cimpertinent and scandalous matter only meant to harass Mr. Beaman.\u201d\n\nBeaman has attended a Tennessee church that Berger founded, but it\u2019s not clear what role, if any, he plays in the pastor\u2019s influence project in Washington. It\u2019s also unclear whether the pastor\u2019s nonprofit pays for the use of the Capitol Hill townhouse.\n\nBerger came to prominence in his home state as the longtime pastor of Grace Chapel, a large church outside Nashville whose members have included the current governor of the state. In 2021, Berger left the church and he and his wife launched their project in Washington.\n\nHe soon began Bible study sessions with senators, representatives and congressional aides, according to the Bergers. Meanwhile, Sarah Berger spent her time \u201cin relationship with and pouring into the lives of congressional wives,\u201d tax filings say.\n\n\u201cIron Sharpening Iron\u201d Pastor Steve Berger and his wife spoke about their project to influence politicians in a podcast last year. Credit: via Youtube\n\nSteve Berger quickly made connections at the highest levels of the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cListen, I have confessed things to Steve that I wouldn't normally confess to anyone else,\u201d Mark Meadows, a White House chief of staff in the first Trump administration who remains an important ally of the president, said at a 2023 event with Berger. \u201cWe have been praying together, having a Bible study each and every week. Not just me, but several members of Congress.\u201d\n\nA group of congressmen gathered on stage together to speak at the pastor\u2019s 60th-birthday party in October, including Bishop, Rep. Barry Moore, Rep. Andy Ogles and Rep. Warren Davidson. All four are current or former members of the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus. (None of the four responded to requests for comment.)\n\nEvidence suggests that Bishop also recently lived at the Capitol Hill townhouse. Three neighbors told ProPublica that the FBI visited them this month asking about Bishop, seemingly as part of the background check for his White House job. \u201cThey said that address,\u201d said one neighbor, adding that the agent showed a photo of Bishop. \u201cThey said: \u2018He lived there up to a couple months ago. Do you know him?\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump has nominated Bishop to be deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, the powerful White House office that recently moved to freeze funding streams across the federal government. Berger celebrated the nomination on Instagram: \u201cI want to congratulate my dear friend and brother, Congressman Dan Bishop, for accepting this incredible opportunity.\u201d",

            "content": "Some of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s fiercest former foes are stepping up to help him prepare for what\u2019s expected to be an aggressive attack at a U.S. House Oversight Committee hearing on the city\u2019s sanctuary status in Washington, D.C., next week.\n\nFormer Mayors Rahm Emanuel and Lori Lightfoot are among those advising Johnson on how to handle questioning from some of Congress\u2019s most outspoken, far-right representatives at the hearing that many view as political theater in a crusade against Democratic policies.\n\nJohnson has pulled no punches against Lightfoot or Emanuel in the past, nor Lightfoot against Johnson. All three of them represent different points on the Democratic political spectrum.\n\nBut everyone involved appears to be putting local rivalries aside to strike a supportive tone as the city prepares for the main stage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very small club of mayors, and all of them, no matter their disagreements, all of them love this city,\u201d Johnson senior adviser Jason Lee said in an interview with WBEZ Friday. \u201cAnd when the city is under the microscope or under attack in any way, it\u2019s not a surprise that they would respond when called upon to support that.\u201d\n\nLightfoot, who is meeting with Johnson on Saturday, echoed that sentiment in a statement to WBEZ.\n\n\u201cWhen Chicago leaders are given a national platform, it\u2019s important to combat the cynical and false narratives about our city,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything I can do to help push back against the Trump Republicans and right wing media to tell the true story of this great city, I will do. I look forward to talking with Mayor Johnson.\u201d\n\nJohnson is set to appear March 5 before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to defend the city\u2019s law that, in part, restricts police from detaining people solely based on their immigration status \u2014 a policy that has been in place, first by executive order, since 1985 .\n\nThe hearing will feature five-minute opening statements from the chair, ranking member and each witness, followed by five-minute rounds of questioning from each of the members present, according to a spokesperson of a committee member.\n\nThe committee \u2014 made up of 26 Republicans and 21 Democrats \u2014 features some of the House of Representatives\u2019 most well-known and controversial firebrands, from Republican Reps. Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert to Democratic Reps. Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib and Jasmine Crockett.\n\nThe call between Emanuel and Johnson this week was one-on-one and lasted about 30 to 45 minutes, Lee said. He did not share what advice Emanuel gave to Johnson but noted Emanuel has significant experience on Capitol Hill, having served in Congress and as chief of staff to former President Barack Obama before becoming mayor in 2011.\n\n\u201cHe has a lot of experience navigating D.C. and understands the goals and orientation of the Republicans on the Oversight Committee and what they\u2019re attempting to do, and so, he\u2019s got some ideas on how to navigate those challenges,\u201d Lee said.\n\nAs for Lightfoot, Lee called Johnson\u2019s former mayoral opponent and ire of the Chicago Teachers Union, the union that helped elect him, a \u201cbrilliant legal mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cLori Lightfoot obviously, in addition to being mayor, is an extraordinary lawyer \u2014 brilliant legal mind \u2014 who has argued many cases and has inside wisdom into how to deal with aggressive panels,\u201d Lee said.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Johnson has spoken to his predecessors since taking office. He met with Emanuel in the summer of 2023 in a meeting that featured advice on how and when to use profanity. He met with Lightfoot during the transition of power on the fifth floor of City Hall, when he took office. But this may be the first time Johnson has reached out for specific advice on how to navigate a great responsibility of his mayorship.\n\nJohnson also plans to meet with Arne Duncan, a civic leader in Chicago, former CEO of Chicago Public Schools and former U.S. Secretary of Education, who has also been a pointed target of the CTU in the past.\n\nDuncan\u2019s adviser, Peter Cunningham, said Duncan \u201calways believes in highlighting where our interests converge instead of where they diverge,\u201d and that Duncan and the mayor speak regularly.\n\n\u201cWe want to see the mayor succeed and represent the city well,\u201d Cunningham said. Duncan has testified before Congress on multiple occasions and will advise Johnson on how to handle that pressure, Cunningham said.\n\nJohnson also sought advice Thursday evening from a group of community organizers, including civil rights attorneys and immigration advocates. Lee did not name the groups involved but said they want to see Johnson fight for federal resources while defending against attacks.\n\nThe unlikely cast of characters banding together to support Johnson could be one indicator of how the hearing might be a political boon. In the face of personal attacks, Johnson may appear sympathetic to his critics, and a strong performance may score him points back home.\n\nBut Delmarie Cobb, a veteran Democratic political strategist, said the risk is that if he isn\u2019t well-prepared, \u201che could lose a lot of ground and credibility,\u201d and that future mayoral contenders will be watching with a close eye.\n\n\u201cIf he blows his nose, they\u2019re gonna be watching him to see how he did it, because they\u2019re looking for any opening they can get,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in that season right now that now everybody is trying to figure out their next steps and what they can do to make Johnson look bad.\u201d\n\nCobb advised Johnson to be calm and on message, to not engage in a shouting match and to come prepared with facts.\n\nLee said to expect just that. Johnson\u2019s demeanor will be \u201cdignified, respectful, calm,\u201d he said. He argued Chicago mayors are \u201cuniquely equipped\u201d to deal with personal attacks, given the city\u2019s rough-and-tumble political landscape.\n\n\u201cThe tenor and tone of Chicago politics is legendary,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI think it was Harold Washington who said, \u2018Politics ain\u2019t beanbag.\u2019 So, I think Brandon Johnson is certainly more than prepared to deal with what may come.\u201d\n\nLee said while Republican governors who\u2019ve made Chicago a target have worked to sow \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d about Chicago\u2019s sanctuary laws, the hearing is an opportunity to reshape public opinion about what the policy does and doesn\u2019t do.\n\nFor instance, while the city\u2019s sanctuary law prevents Chicago police from asking someone for their immigration status or holding someone beyond their release date without a warrant to give ICE time to arrive, it does not allow police officers to impede enforcement officials from carrying out an arrest warrant.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department speaks regularly with Immigration and Customs Enforcement when they are carrying out deportations here, Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said at a news conference in January.\n\nJohnson will work to highlight these nuances in his testimony, Lee said.\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether a current lawsuit by the Trump administration against the city will limit what Johnson or the city\u2019s attorney, Mary Richardson-Lowry, believe he can say at the hearing.\n\nThe lawsuit aims to invalidate portions of both local and state protections and argues that the laws are \u201cdeliberately impeding\u201d federal immigration enforcement.\n\n\u201cCertainly it\u2019s a consideration,\u201d Lee said. \u201cOf the four mayors, he\u2019s the only one being sued by the Department of Justice over these same issues. There\u2019s also legislation being proposed in Congress that would recall funding from sanctuary cities so there are certain legal and policy implications around the subject matter that factors into this testimony.\u201d\n\nJohnson is expected to appear alongside Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, New York City Mayor Eric Adams and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston. Adams has worked to curry favor with Trump and refrain from criticizing him ; after meeting with border czar Tom Homan, Adams said he would roll back New York City\u2019s sanctuary city law to allow ICE agents on Rikers Island, a jail facility. Earlier this month, Trump\u2019s Department of Justice ordered federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against Adams.\n\nMariah Woelfel and Tessa Weinberg cover Chicago politics and government at WBEZ.",

The duel between Rafer Johnson and Yang Chuan-kwang at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome exemplified this in dramatic fashion. The two came from very different backgrounds\u2014Rafer Johnson was a young African American from California, while Yang Chuan-kwang was from Taiwan\u2014but their paths crossed at UCLA, where the two became friends and training partners. In 1960, however, the two athletes met in Rome as fierce rivals for the gold.\n\nAfter a long first day Johnson led Yang by 55 points, despite the fact that Yang had finished ahead in four of the five competitions. The second day started poorly for Johnson; he hit the first hurdle in the 110-metre hurdles. His finishing time of 15.3 seconds was well behind Yang\u2019s time of 14.6, and he fell from the lead. The two traded positions in the standings again after the discus throw, and Johnson increased his lead with a career-best performance in the pole vault and better throw than Yang in the javelin. Yet victory for Johnson was far from certain at the start of the final event, the 1,500 metres. He led by only 67 points. Yang was favoured in this event, having previously run it in 4:36, while Johnson\u2019s personal best was 4:54.2. Yang needed to beat Johnson by 10 seconds to win the decathlon and become the first Taiwanese to win a gold medal. Yang did win the race, but Johnson came in only 1.2 seconds behind him, running a personal best of 4:49.7. Although Italian fans chanted \u201cgive them both the gold,\u201d Johnson took home the championship and Yang took the silver, the first medal of any kind won by a Taiwanese athlete.",

            "content": "AJ Johnson needed only two minutes of playing time to make a positive first impression on his new team, the Washington Wizards. On Feb. 7 against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Johnson caught a pass in the right corner, drove along the baseline and elevated for an emphatic dunk. His new teammates catapulted off their seats on the bench.\n\nThat sequence offered a tantalizing glimpse of why Wizards executives insisted that Johnson, a 20-year-old guard, be included in the trade-deadline deal that also brought Khris Middleton, a 2028 first-round pick swap and cash from the Milwaukee Bucks for Kyle Kuzma and a 2025 second-round pick.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a great feeling being somewhere that I\u2019m wanted and looked at as valuable,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI just want to just work super hard and become everything I want to become in this game.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, Johnson remains a bit of a mystery to Wizards fans, because he has played a total of only 26 minutes across three NBA games.\n\nAnother mystery is Colby Jones, a 22-year-old guard the Wizards acquired from the Sacramento Kings in the three-team trade that, among other people, also included Marcus Smart arriving from Memphis. Jones, a second-year player who is 6 foot 6, hasn\u2019t made his Wizards debut yet, but he has logged minutes for the Capital City Go-Go.\n\n\u201cI just play with a ton of energy on defense,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI feel like my energy on the defensive side of the ball is nonstop. I feel like I play really hard. I have a high motor, and (I\u2019m) just a winner. I just want to win. I want to make all the winning plays. I think that\u2019s the first thing they\u2019ll see about me.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about what Johnson and Jones will bring to the Wizards, The Athletic brought together NBA Draft analyst Sam Vecenie and Wizards beat writer Josh Robbins for a discussion. Vecenie scouted Johnson and Jones heavily before the last two drafts.\n\nJosh Robbins: Sam, would you please fill us in on Johnson\u2019s basketball background?\n\nSam Vecenie: Johnson took a circuitous route to the NBA and is something of a late-bloomer physically. He grew about six inches over the pandemic to get up to around 6-foot-4 and was ranked outside of the top 100 of his recruiting class until a strong junior season and then a killer summer between his junior and senior seasons.\n\nUnfortunately, I think the people around Johnson made some poor decisions for him, and he moved around a ton and never got a chance to really get settled. He switched high schools several times throughout California and even had a brief commitment to Donda Academy, the private school that was founded by Ye (formerly Kanye West). Even the commitment process was all over the map. He was originally set to attend Texas but then decommitted six months later and decided to turn pro and join the Next Stars program in the NBL in Australia, playing for the Illawarra Hawks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, he struggled with the translation physically as he was under 170 pounds when he got to Australia and wasn\u2019t ready to play professional basketball. Illawarra also fired its coach midseason, so that created even more upheaval. He still decided to turn pro and was highly impressive in his pre-draft evaluation with the Bucks, one of the few private workouts he did. They took him at No. 23, a decision that I felt didn\u2019t make all that much sense given that they are a team that is contending and he is a pretty serious project from a physical standpoint. Johnson has a ton of talent as a scorer. He has an immense number of natural gifts, including real explosiveness and suddenness blended with balance and coordination. He has real touch as a scorer. But he also doesn\u2019t have the physical strength yet to actually absorb contact all over the court and be able to get the most out of his tools.\n\nRobbins: What are your impressions of his limited playing time with the Bucks and his extensive time in the G League with the Wisconsin Herd?\n\nVecenie: Well, Johnson didn\u2019t have much time with the Bucks, so it\u2019s probably worth ignoring that. In the G League, it felt the same as what we saw in the NBL. Mainly, it\u2019s just a lot of flashes. Johnson still isn\u2019t quite physically ready yet to play professional basketball. I\u2019ve always felt like he needed a couple of years of college, playing against talent his age and where his strength issues might be a bit less pronounced. That would give him a chance to get reps at a high level, and not be as bothered by the physicality that he faces night after night in pro hoops.\n\nThe flashes of scoring still come through, and I\u2019m a believer in him being able to shoot the ball. His passing has also been impressive in moments this season. But the big thing here is that Johnson was always a project. How he performed this year was never really going to matter all that much. Seeing how he grew from this season to next season and then from his second season to his third season was always going to be the key. He really just needs to allow his body to fill out, and we\u2019ll see where he stands by the start of Year 3.\n\nRobbins: Bottom line, what does he need to improve? At his best, what kind of player can he become?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVecenie: The idea isn\u2019t all that dissimilar from someone like Anfernee Simons in Portland. Johnson has real potential to be an extremely high-level scorer with explosive moments around the rim when he has a runway, but more than that, it\u2019s the ease with which he has potential to get to his shots. That blend of balance and explosiveness allows him to really separate to get to stepbacks. He can really shoot the ball effectively in those moments. But again, it\u2019s all going to come back to what he becomes physically. Simons feels like the right point of comparison because he wasn\u2019t able to play at all in his rookie year either before coming on a bit more in the second half of his sophomore year, continuing to make strides as a third-year player, then really coming into his own as a fourth-year guy.\n\nBecause of how long I think it\u2019s going to take Johnson to actually reach his potential as a late-bloomer who is still only 20 years old, I\u2019m much more interested in him as a member of this Wizards rebuild than I was when he was on the Bucks. The Bucks didn\u2019t have a long runway to give him to allow him to reach his potential. The Wizards, however, are near the start of a multi-year rebuild. They can give Johnson the space and time he needs to develop into his frame, and see where his skill set sits after that. I think I would bet on Johnson being a solid NBA player by the time he\u2019s 24 or so. But that\u2019s a long time away, still. The question for the Wizards now is whether or not they can help him reach that level quicker, and thus get some value out of his rookie-scale deal.\n\nColby Jones (left) played in 54 regular-season games in two seasons for Sacramento before being traded to the Wizards. (Darren Yamashita / Imagn Images)\n\nRobbins: Tell us, please, about Colby Jones.\n\nVecenie: Jones was an early second-round pick in the 2023 NBA Draft. He was a multi-year player at Xavier, where he made the All-Big East team in 2023. When he was younger, he was seen as a potential bigger guard who could play some point, but I think that has largely passed now and he\u2019s more of a two-guard who can be a secondary initiator.\n\nJones, despite now being in his fifth season post-high school, is still only 22. He is one of those players who should be considered a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. He\u2019s a solid shooter and had made 35.4 percent of his 3-point attempts in the G League before his trade to the Wizards. He passes well, is a good finisher and makes good decisions, but he\u2019s not a monster athlete who is going to be able to live in the lane and get paint touches to take immense advantage of those skills, either. Defensively, he\u2019s aggressive and is capable of taking on tough assignments with his physicality on the perimeter, but I wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s been a huge playmaker or difference-maker on that end yet, either.\n\nJones is just a good, solid, young basketball player. But he doesn\u2019t have anything to hang his hat on yet.\n\nRobbins: What does Jones need to improve, and if he develops properly, what kind of player would he be?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVecenie: I\u2019d love to see him become a defensive specialist by getting stronger and continuing to work on his footwork long term. If he can add some strength and keep adding to his quickness, he should be able to grow into being a tough player who can take on a variety of assignments. But he also really needs to keep confirming that he can knock down shots from distance, since that was his big question entering the NBA. He was always a bit inconsistent at Xavier. So far, so good. But if he ends up not being an NBA player, I bet that it\u2019ll be because it\u2019s a combination of him being a solid defender, but not a great defender, and only being a solid shooter, and not a great one.\n\nAgain, Jones just needs to find that skill set that allows him to officially make his mark on the NBA. He doesn\u2019t quite have that one thing yet.\n\n(Top photo of AJ Johnson: Reggie Hildred / Imagn Images)",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other best vaccine stocks to buy now.\n\nWhat Will Trump\u2019s Tariffs Mean for the Pharma Industry?\n\nOn February 24, CNBC reported that President Trump declared that sweeping US tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada \u201cwill go forward\u201d in a statement before the expiry of their month-long delay on their implementation. When asked about the postponed tariffs at a White House press conference, President Trump said:\n\n\u201cThe tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that foreign nations have been taking advantage of the US in \u201cjust about everything,\u201d reiterating his plans to impose \u201creciprocal tariffs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the tariffs will go forward, yes, and we\u2019re going to make up a lot of territory,\u201d Trump said.\n\nOn February 21, Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities America\u2019s healthcare sector strategist, appeared on CNBC to talk about these tariffs and the ways they could affect the US pharmaceutical sector. Although he was unclear about the exact intention behind these tariffs, he said that he did not consider the pharmaceutical industry to be all that special with respect to other verticals, including technology and industrials, such that President Trump would intend to enlarge its presence in the US.\n\nTo him, the tariffs are not just about the generics or branded but are rather more about how the biotech or pharmaceutical industry fits into the grander plans around scaling up domestic manufacturing. Most biotech and pharma companies have a significant presence in the US. However, questions of whether they will hire more people in the US compared to Europe or Asia and whether they will bring back more business to America still stand without answers.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Performing Pharma Stocks So Far in 2025 and 10 Oversold Pharma Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\n\nTariffs and On-Shore Capacity in the US\n\nAlthough Holz was unclear about the answers to such questions, he did say that anything coming out of Europe or China would obviously be fair game. The pharmaceutical companies would say that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as part of the Biden administration is incredibly crippling, and the business that needs to be tied up to make the earnings based on that is very challenging for the sector. Adding Trump\u2019s tariffs to the list would complicate the sector possibly more than others, with the tariffs acting as a \u201cthird strike\u201d against the US pharma sector.\n\nDelving deeper into the topic, Holz said that building up manufacturing capacities and facilities from scratch is not as easy as it sounds and requires multiple years to reach a point where companies can produce at a high rate. Therefore, he is unclear about the impact of tariffs on the production capacity and on-shoring of pharma companies.\n\nWe recently discussed what Trump\u2019s tariffs could mean for the healthcare industry and looked at another analyst\u2019s perspective on the topic in a recently published article on 12 Most Oversold Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\n\u201cSince more and more companies in the US are looking towards China for deals regarding the next promising molecule, whether in the obesity or cancer space, the impact of tariffs on this ongoing trend has become a subject of significant discussion in the healthcare industry. On February 7, Carlo Rizzuto, Versant Ventures managing director, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Fast Money\u2019 to discuss the impact of tariffs on healthcare. Rizzuto believed that there are two ways in which tariffs could impact the industry. The first would be products innovated in China and brought over to the US or other markets. To understand how the tariffs would affect such trade processes, the industry would have to see how the tariffs are actually structured in the market. Secondly and more tangibly, China is a massive center for contract research and manufacturing for the US healthcare industry. Therefore, anything that increases that cost is likely to make the market conditions more challenging. The healthcare industry is already under pressure in terms of investor sentiment, and an increase in cost is not going to help its functioning.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 20 vaccine stocks. We then selected the top 10 most popular stocks among elite hedge funds as of Q4 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Photograph: Nigel Stripe\n\nA former Limerick senior hurler is taking a High Court action against his old employer, Johnson & Johnson, following an incident where he went to the aid of a coworker who had his arm caught inside some factory machinery but who suffered long-term injuries in his efforts to help his colleague.\n\nMark Keane, of Raheen, Ballyneety, Co Limerick, was an employee at Johnson & Johnson Vision Care (Ireland) at its plant in the National Technological Park, Plassey, Co Limerick, when the incident occurred in September 2018.\n\nMr Keane won three consecutive All-Irelands with the Limerick under-21s between 2000 and 2002 and was in the seniors from 2000 to 2006.\n\nThe 43-year-old is alleging Johnson & Johnson was negligent and breached its duty towards him on September 10th, 2018, while he was working as a technician, making contact lenses, when the incident occurred.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nMr Keane says he was on the factory floor when a colleague caught his hand in a machine on the line next to him and started roaring in pain. Mr Keane said he ran to help his colleague but because the colleague could not free his arm his body formed a barrier between the plaintiff and a release lever which could have freed the arm.\n\nThe plaintiff told Mr Justice Paul Coffey he tried to reach into the machine but got his own hand caught on some internal gridding or railing and his little finger on his right hand was bent backwards.\n\nHe then took the weight of the lid, top and plate of the machine and managed to hold it ajar for 30-60 seconds until co-workers arrived with a crowbar and freed the coworker.\n\nHis lawyers, Holmes O\u2019Malley Sexton LLP, submit that it was this incident that caused the plaintiff to suffer sustained, continuous and severe personal injury, loss, damage, inconvenience and expense.\n\nMichael McMahon SC, for Mr Keane, said his client could not find work because of the injury that affected the nerves in his hand and damaged his elbow and back.\n\nHis lawyers claim Johnson & Johnson failed to provide Mr Keane with a safe place of work and safe system of work.\n\nIn his opening speech, Mr McMahon said his client had been a \u201crescuer\u201d on the date but instead suffered \u201ca very serious injury\u201d that caused \u201cextensive damage\u201d.\n\nCounsel said the \u201cnet result\u201d of the incident was that his client, who had been a \u201cvery fine hurler\u201d, was left with a painful, frozen shoulder, suffered pain up and down his arm and that the damage to his hand had created a loss of grip.\n\nMr McMahon said the injury had huge implications for his client, adding that Mr Keane could not get a job and that he would have been earning \u20ac1,300 a week net if he was still working at Johnson & Johnson.\n\nMr Keane told Mr Justice Coffey that his right arm and shoulder took the weight of the machine when he lifted it for the crowbar to be used because his finger was already \u201cvery badly damaged\u201d.\n\nThe plaintiff said there was \u201croaring and panic\u201d at the scene.\n\n\u201cAll of that pressure was down on my right arm, my right shoulder. If you asked me to do it this second, I don\u2019t think I could budge it,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +7.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson & Johnson falls in, has gained 9.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Johnson & Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.59 per share, indicating a change of -4.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.58 points to a change of +6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.07 indicates a change of +4.6% from what Johnson & Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Johnson & Johnson is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

Jared Goff is not.\n\nHe might\u2019ve said all sorts of things that didn\u2019t sound so blunt. He might have used more tact.\n\nBen Johnson was trending Wednesday.\n\nOf course he was \u2014 he spoke the truth during the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis: Caleb Williams is mobile. Jared Goff is not.\n\nThat was the gist of Johnson\u2019s words, anyway. And if you\u2019re honest \u2014 a hard thing to do in fandom \u2014 you\u2019d agree with the former Lions\u2019 offensive coordinator\u2019s assessment. Williams makes plays outside the pocket, or \u201cout-of-structure,\u201d to use Johnson\u2019s phrase. Goff does not. At least not nearly as frequently.\n\nJohnson said he was excited about the possibilities of working with such a quarterback. He said he\u2019d never worked with such a quarterback. He said when such a quarterback makes plays when the pocket collapses, it demoralizes the defense.\n\nAROUND THE NFC NORTH: Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell still 'loves' Ben Johnson; what's next for J.J. McCarthy?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on the other side,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cand I have experienced it, and it\u2019s demoralizing when you\u2019re on the other side, and you\u2019re watching that happen to your defense.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t straight bring up Jayden Daniels, or the playoff loss to Washington's young quarterback last month. He didn\u2019t need to. Everyone knew who he was referring to \u2014 though Daniels wasn\u2019t the only mobile quarterback to shred the Lions defense. (See: Josh Allen.)\n\nWhat Johnson could\u2019ve said is that the Lions defense was compromised. And that the Eagles just showed what a good defensive line can do to a mobile quarterback in the Super Bowl \u2014 and to Daniels, for that matter, as Philadelphia took down the Commanders handily the week after the Commanders beat the Lions.\n\nHe might\u2019ve said all sorts of things that didn\u2019t sound so blunt. He might have used more tact. (Can you imagine Aaron Glenn causing a similar stir? No? I can\u2019t either.)\n\nTact is something Johnson is working on, and communication in general. He\u2019s, um, getting there?\n\nWitness his interview on Pro Football Talk this week. Hosts Mike Florio and Chris Simms were talking about Johnson\u2019s deep bag of tricks. Penei Sewell came up.\n\n\u201c(Sewell) looked like he was ready to throw a pass,\u201d Florio said to Johnson. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very rare for an offensive lineman to throw a pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best part of that was he threw a dime every single time in practice,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was better than some ... other ... people ... Jared Goff?\u201d\n\nHe smiled, sort of. He was joking. Maybe. Possibly. Or was he?\n\nThen he said this: \u201c(Sewell) was pretty darn good throwing on the move.\u201d\n\nTranslation: Sewell throws on the run better than Goff. Haha, right?\n\nClearly, Johnson was talking about what a unicorn Sewell is. Goff took a stray in the joke. Just as Goff took a stray when Johnson talked about Williams.\n\nPart of being a (good) head coach is knowing when to be blunt and when to be politic. It should also be knowing how to joke. Then again, maybe Johnson\u2019s schemes and dreams and teaching techniques are so sublime it won\u2019t matter.\n\nBut I doubt it.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t need to be Dan Campbell \u2014 few have the Lions coach's sense of humor nor his emotional sensitivity. He will, however, need to connect with the room, and with the front office, and, to a certain degree, the public; caustic jerks don\u2019t get the benefit of the doubt when the losses pile up in the beginning.\n\nOf course, Johnson is neither caustic nor a jerk. He\u2019s pointed, and there is plenty of room for that in the NFL, as there is in life.\n\nIf we remove the pointedness of his comments about his new quarterback, and his awkward attempt to be funny regarding Sewell, then it\u2019s much easier to hear his words. And those words were true.\n\nWhich means he wasn\u2019t talking trash about Goff or the Lions. He was asked a question about Williams. He answered.\n\nTurns out his answer wasn\u2019t the truth some Lions fans wanted to hear. Nor, apparently, was it what a couple of Lions players wanted to hear.\n\nKerby Joseph and Amik Robertson both posted amusing retorts to posts of Johnson\u2019s clips from the combine. Both were along the lines of ... I see you. And: we\u2019ll see you next season.\n\nAll of which is amusing to Chicago Bears fans, who took to social media to laugh out loud at the \u201cMotor City crybabies.\u201d\n\nOh, there were more colorful descriptions of those freaking out over Johnson\u2019s comments. But this isn\u2019t the place to print them.\n\nWell, except for this one: \u201cShut the (expletive) up!\u201d\n\nSome Lions fans are salty, no doubt, posting good riddance and anyone could\u2019ve led an offense with these players. Bears fans loved the tears. That\u2019s how it should be. That\u2019s how it will be when these teams meet up in the fall.\n\nIf Johnson rebuilds Chicago and passes Detroit in the divisional pecking order? Then that\u2019ll remind us yet again why Johnson\u2019s combine comments trended in the first place:\n\nThe Lions still haven\u2019t won a Super Bowl. Had they done so, especially with Johnson as the coordinator, no one would care that Williams can run and Goff cannot, and no one would care that Johnson pointed that out.\n\nTurns out we\u2019re still sensitive around here.\n\nAnd while winning the last couple seasons has been fun, winning it all is the only way to remove the trauma that forever lurks under the surface.\n\nContact Shawn Windsor: swindsor@freepress.com.

            "content": "Edit via Liam McGuire.\n\nIt had been awhile since Cam\u2019Ron and the It Is What It Is podcast started a beef, but just in the nick of time the hip-hop mogul turned sports media host found a new target in Chad \u201cOchocinco\u201d Johnson.\n\nAfter a segment reacting to Johnson\u2019s odd recent comments to Stephen A. Smith about undergoing an enlargement procedure downstairs, Cam\u2019Ron proceeded to air dirty laundry about his professional history with Johnson on Tuesday\u2019s episode of IIWII.\n\nCam\u2019Ron referenced a tweet from multiple years back when Johnson allegedly wrote that he was \u201ccoming for\u201d Cam\u2019s spot after the early success of IIWII. Around that same time, Cam apparently offered Johnson a recurring role on the show \u2014 a natural fit as they both were based in Miami.\n\n\u201cI tried to give him a job,\u201d Cam said, to which Johnson replied that he does business through his agent.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so dumb, you can\u2019t even speak for yourself, stupid motherf***er,\u201d Cam added.\n\nThat\u2019s when Cam landed the punch that seemingly hit Johnson hardest, claiming he could pay Johnson more than he\u2019s getting for Nightcap with Shannon Sharpe. As a point of comparison, Cam referenced deals with Michael Irvin, a weekly NFL guest, and Mark Jackson, who hosts his own podcast for the network.\n\n\u201cI tried to offer you more paper than you\u2019re probably getting now,\u201d Cam said. \u201cI bet you ain\u2019t getting paid the money that Mark Jackson and Mike Irvin got paid with us. I don\u2019t know this for a fact \u2026 but this is why you\u2019re doing the s*** you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nWednesday night on Nightcap, Johnson responded in an emotional 15-minute segment alongside Sharpe.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the poll powered by Disqus.\n\nJohnson corrected the record on his initial \u201ccoming for your spot\u201d post, clarifying that he meant it as a compliment rather than a threat.\n\n\u201cIf you check the numbers, what I said I was going to do, I\u2019ve already done and surpassed that,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBuddy I ain\u2019t no guest feature. I\u2019m the main attraction. What is you talking about? I\u2019ve always been the main attraction. In your lane, you do what you do. I\u2019m in completely different lanes and completely different rooms from you.\u201d\n\nJohnson went on to say that despite Cam\u2019s claims, the Harlem rap legend would not have been able to afford him. As Johnson continued, it was clear the idea that he plays second fiddle to Sharpe or is a sideshow got to him. So he shot back at Cam\u2019Ron and cohost Mase by saying their show isn\u2019t exactly the most serious thing in sports media, either.\n\n\u201cI think because I do everything in an entertaining, fun, laughing way, you kind of forget and don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s being done over here and how special what we have is,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cTheir views, they got some high ones. But it\u2019s mainly about going at people \u2026 over here, it\u2019s about having fun, entertaining, and the stories.\u201d\n\nLike most media beefs, this one doesn\u2019t seem to have gristle \u2014 at least for now. Cam is a poet and an eloquent speaker; he can talk smack and throw shade with the best. Chad Johnson has it made working with Shannon Sharpe and Colin Cowherd\u2019s The Volume. Cam likely noticed every single hater as a rapper starting a sports show, and felt disrespected by Johnson at some point along the way. Johnson, from his NFL career to now, doesn\u2019t appreciate being patronized or not taken seriously.\n\nIt\u2019s all colliding right now, the way all beefs do in 2025: taking shots via social media or podcast from afar.",

            "content": "Credit: Getty Images\n\nChicago Bears: A New Era Begins with Caleb Williams and Ben Johnson\n\n\n\nRyan Poles on combine, free agency outlook | Chicago Bears\n\nPoles: Ben Johnson will take Caleb Williams to the \u2018next level\u2019 | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC\n\nThe Chicago Bears made headlines last year by selecting Caleb Williams as their franchise quarterback with the first overall pick. General Manager Ryan Poles faced immense pressure as the team passed on other high-profile prospects to secure the dynamic USC product. However, Williams\u2019 rookie season did not go as planned. The Bears struggled on the field, head coach Matt Eberflus was fired in November, and the team missed the playoffs while Jayden Daniels, the second overall pick, led the Washington Commanders to the NFC Championship Game.Determined to turn things around, Poles hired Ben Johnson , the former offensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions, as the Bears\u2019 new head coach. During a recent appearance on PFT Live, Poles expressed confidence in Johnson\u2019s ability to unlock Williams\u2019 potential, stating that Johnson\u2019s strategic approach and offensive creativity could be the key to Williams making a significant leap in his sophomore season.When Caleb Williams met Ben Johnson at his introductory press conference, it was evident that mutual respect was already established between the two. However, NFL rules require a mandatory dead period, preventing them from working together until the Bears\u2019 offseason program begins on April 7. Despite this delay, the Bears are focused on setting Williams up for success in the upcoming season.Poles emphasized the importance of building a solid foundation of trust between Johnson and Williams. In an exclusive interview with Marquee Sports Network, Poles stated, \u201cWe have to wait until the door opens and they can start working together and get off and running. That relationship is going to be special, but it\u2019s going to be critical for them to build that trust and be able to have honest conversations with each other in terms of what the expectations are. If they can get that done, we\u2019ll be in a good spot.\u201dJohnson\u2019s coaching philosophy centers around mastering the fundamentals. He plans to break everything down \u201cto the studs\u201d and focus on the basics with Williams and the rest of the roster. Johnson aims to establish a culture that emphasizes technique, discipline, and precision, which he believes will create a strong foundation for long-term success.Ben Johnson is determined to mold Caleb Williams into a top-tier NFL quarterback by prioritizing the essentials of the position. He detailed his approach at the NFL Scouting Combine, explaining, \u201cFor Caleb, what are the important things about playing the quarterback position at the NFL level? It\u2019s as simple as the procedure, the huddle, breaking the huddle, using cadence, motion, shifts, all those things that, that can help attack a defense, that we feel like can take another here in Chicago.\u201d Johnson\u2019s goal is to build a system tailored to Williams\u2019 strengths while surrounding him with the necessary talent and support staff.Despite the struggles of his rookie season, Williams now has the opportunity to start fresh under Johnson\u2019s guidance. The Bears are optimistic that this partnership will lead to sustained success, with Johnson\u2019s strategic mind and Williams\u2019 remarkable physical talents combining to create a formidable offensive force. Johnson\u2019s excitement for this potential is palpable, as he recognizes Williams\u2019 unique athleticism and the possibilities it presents.Also Read: How Bengals' all-defense 4-round NFL mock draft make them as serious contender The Chicago Bears are entering a new chapter, driven by the promising collaboration between Caleb Williams and Ben Johnson. If this relationship blossoms as Poles anticipates, the Bears could finally break through their struggles and emerge as a competitive force in the NFL.",

            "content": "Cell therapy, a treatment that uses a patient\u2019s own immune cells or the immune cells from another person to fight disease, has revolutionized options for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers. Johnson & Johnson has been changing the trajectory of this innovative form of personalized medicine and has led pharmaceuticals within multiple myeloma treatments for more than 20 years. The company currently has one cell therapy treatment for blood cancer on the market and a robust pipeline of diverse cell therapies to treat various cancers in development.\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting time for scientists and researchers, who hope that harnessing the power of the immune system can dramatically improve outcomes for people diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\u201cThe capabilities it takes to get these therapies to market because of the infrastructure required around manufacturing, development and commercialization is significant,\u201d says Rebecca Poehnelt, Vice President for Global Lymphoma, Leukemia and Cell Therapy Commercial Strategy, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. \u201cJohnson & Johnson is unique because we have the proven capabilities, experience and resources to do it.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the cell therapies Johnson & Johnson is innovating and the cancers they target, plus how the company is making sure these lifesaving treatments reach patients in need around the world.\n\nFulfilling the promise of CAR-T\n\nPut simply, cell therapy is the transfer of intact, live cells into a patient to help fight disease. Since 2017, Johnson & Johnson has focused on the development of a type of cell therapy called chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, known as CAR-T.\n\nCAR-T therapy involves collecting a patient\u2019s T cells (a type of immune-system cell) at a treatment site (such as a hospital), transporting the cells to a manufacturing site, reprogramming the genetic material of the T cells so they recognize and target the cancer, transporting the cells back to the treatment site and infusing the modified cells into the patient to attack the cancer cells.\n\n\u201cThese engineered T cells can surveil and traffic all over the body to identify the cancer wherever it may be and kill the cancerous cells,\u201d says Molly Perkins, Vice President, Head of Cell and Genetic Medicines Discovery at Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine.\n\nAn illustration of the CAR-T process: A patient\u2019s T cells (in blue) are reprogrammed so they can recognize and target cancer.\n\nAnother advantage of cell therapy: T cells can persist, so they can keep killing new cancer cells that arise\u2014which means a patient could potentially stay disease-free for a longer period.\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Johnson & Johnson\u2019s first CAR-T cell therapy treatment to treat multiple myeloma, or cancer of the bone marrow, in patients for whom other treatments have proven unsuccessful. An estimated 36,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2024, and more than 12,500 Americans will die of the disease.\n\n\u201cMultiple myeloma patients have an extraordinary response to CAR-T cell therapy,\u201d says Perkins. \u201cAfter a single infusion of these cells, the cells can then persist\u2014we call it a living drug\u2014and keep going until they find and kill the cancer cells.\u201d\n\nAmong the other CAR-T therapies currently in development at Johnson & Johnson are treatments that would treat patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Johnson & Johnson researchers are evaluating cell therapy as a treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which is the most common type of NHL. This cell therapy engineers cells to recognize and attack targets found on the surface of these cancer cells.\n\nMore than 18,000 people are diagnosed with DLBCL each year in the U.S., and between 30% to 40% can relapse or eventually become resistant to first-line treatment and require additional treatment options.\n\nThe complexity of accessing and delivering cell therapy\n\nAs revolutionary as cell therapy is, getting it to patients requires working through the logistical complexities.\n\n\u201cA patient\u2019s cells are removed at the treatment site, shipped out for manufacturing and then transported back to the original treatment facility where the engineered cells are infused into the patient,\u201d says Perkins.\n\n\u201cBecause cells extracted from patients must be delivered to the treatment facilities and back to the patients within a limited time frame, transportation considerations are very important,\u201d says Dominique De Jaeger, Vice President, CAR-T Global Supply Chain, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. \u201cOur facilities need to be within easy reach of very good air and road transportation.\u201d\n\nOnce patient cells reach a manufacturing facility, the next step of the highly individualized manufacturing process begins. \u201cThis is a truly personalized supply chain that requires us to protect and control the chain of identity and chain of custody of each patient\u2019s cells throughout the entire process,\u201d says De Jaeger.\n\nImproving the availability of CAR-T therapies by increasing manufacturing capacity is a company priority.\n\nGetting cell therapy to patients\n\nJohnson & Johnson is driven by a strong sense of urgency to broaden access to cell therapy for patients around the globe. The company\u2019s commitment to innovation and collaboration to simplify processes fuels efforts to ensure more patients can benefit from these transformative treatments as quickly and responsibly as possible.\n\nBringing CAR-T to a larger global market is also a priority. \u201cIn addition to being available in the U.S., we have launched our cell therapy to treat patients with blood cancer in Germany, Austria, Brazil, Switzerland and the UK,\u201d says Poehnelt. \u201cWe are proud to have treated over 5,000 patients globally with this treatment and are working to accelerate the launch in additional markets around the world, with plans to expand in the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d\n\nImproving the availability of CAR-T therapies in the community setting is a topic that Johnson & Johnson cares deeply about. \u201cWe know that many patients with multiple myeloma could potentially benefit from cell therapy, but they may not live close to a large academic medical center with expertise in administering these treatments,\u201d says Poehnelt.\n\nIn addition to its in-house capabilities, Johnson & Johnson is further growing its manufacturing footprint by partnering with other manufacturing organizations.\n\n\u201cWe have already more than quadrupled our manufacturing capacity since we launched and are on track to significantly expand our patient reach around the world in the coming years,\u201d says De Jaeger.\n\nOur goal with blood cancers is to turn incurable diseases into curable diseases. Rebecca Poehnelt Vice President for Global Lymphoma, Leukemia and Cell Therapy Commercial Strategy, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine\n\nThe future of cell therapy\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s ongoing innovation in cell therapy plays a critical role in helping to transform outcomes for patients with blood cancers like multiple myeloma. \u201cCell therapy is among the most efficacious platforms in blood cancers,\u201d says Poehnelt. \u201cOur goal with blood cancers is to turn incurable diseases into curable diseases.\u201d\n\nIn the future, cell therapy may have the potential to take on a more expanded role. \u201cRight now, all of our products in the clinical development and commercial stage are for hematologic malignancies,\u201d says Perkins. \u201cBut there is commitment to make CAR-T cells work for solid tumors and be able to treat patients with cancer who right now don\u2019t have good cell therapy options.\u201d\n\nJohnson & Johnson is one of a few companies that can point to several examples of industry-leading excellence in its cell therapy pipeline and on-market portfolio, where it is poised to advance the next generation of cancer care.\n\nThe possibilities are energizing the company\u2019s scientists and researchers, who are inspired by the idea of using cell therapy to tackle diseases beyond the blood cancer space. Ultimately, the goal is to create a world where chronic or incurable conditions can be treated or cured with a single treatment\u2014one that patients all over the world will be able to access.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other best retirement stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nAfter much suspense, the US Federal Reserve finally began cutting interest rates in late 2024, dropping the federal funds rate by 75 basis points in two cuts in September and November, with the market expecting further cuts this year. The Fed\u2019s decision came in reaction to falling US inflation and employment market statistics, which suggested that the elusive soft landing was still within reach. However, as February comes to a close, things appear to have changed. For the time being, the Federal Open Market Committee is projected to leave interest rates unchanged on March 19. That\u2019s because the labor market looks to be strong, and inflation is still over goal and slightly increasing. The FOMC\u2019s most recent meeting in January also said that \u201crespondents generally judged that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed,\u201d implying that any reduction (if at all) will occur sometime later in 2025.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, the 65-and-older population in the United States will grow from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million by 2050, when it is expected to account for more than a quarter of the total population. The World Economic Forum further predicts that half of kids born in the United States in 2007 would survive to the age of 103. As such, wages seem to be falling behind inflation as people live longer lives. That\u2019s especially true now that businesses have moved the burden of retirement savings to employees, giving 401(k)s instead of pensions that promise a fixed income each month.\n\nOne dilemma many face as they approach retirement is how much money they will need to live comfortably when they stop working. According to Consumer Expenditure Surveys, the average retiree household in the United States spends around $5,000 per month. With a median 401(k) balance of $210,724 for those aged 60 to 69, implementing the 4% withdrawal rule yields around $702 per month\u2014which, when combined with the average monthly Social Security payment of $1,976, still falls short of meeting basic needs. According to Dan Doonan, executive director of the National Institute on Retirement Security, non-wealthy workers still have insufficient retirement coverage, forcing them to save on their own:",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson pulled off a stunning turnaround Tuesday night to rescue a critical vote to advance President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda that had seemed doomed just moments earlier.\n\nSurprising even some of his critics, Johnson and his leadership team capped hours of drama in the Capitol by successfully flipping multiple Republican holdouts to pass a budget blueprint that will mark the first step toward moving Trump\u2019s ambitious agenda forward. With help from last-minute phone calls from Trump, GOP leaders spent all of Tuesday in a furious pressure campaign to win backing for their plan.\n\n\u201cThe world didn\u2019t end today. But I do see the edge,\u201d Rep. Pat Fallon, a Texas Republican, said of the whiplash in the House.\n\nRepublicans had punted the vote Tuesday night only to turn around minutes later to call fleeing members back to the floor to muscle through the plan.\n\nIn the end, Johnson lost just a single vote \u2014 fiscal hawk Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 which was all he could afford. The Democrats\u2019 whip team scrambled to get near-full attendance on their side: Rep. Brittany Pettersen flew with her 4-week-old baby to make it in time for the vote and Rep. Kevin Mullin, who is recovering from complications from knee surgery, flew with an IV from California.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Democratic lawmaker brought her newborn son to vote against GOP proposal 01:13 - Source: CNN Democratic lawmaker brought her newborn son to vote against GOP proposal 01:13\n\nBut the drama won\u2019t end there: Johnson and his allies acknowledge that what comes next will be much more difficult. Tuesday night\u2019s vote itself was procedural and GOP leaders from the House and Senate will need to agree on how exactly to move ahead with Trump\u2019s sprawling legislative package now that they have adopted divergent plans. The days-long saga over the House budget blueprint laid bare bitter divisions among Republicans that will make it extraordinarily difficult to pass that package in both chambers.\n\nStill, the win comes at a critical time for Trump and Johnson as their party faces crushing deadlines ahead, including avoiding a government shutdown next month and the threat of an economic default later this spring. As with Tuesday night\u2019s vote, navigating those political landmines will require near total unity from the GOP.\n\nGOP leaders will now get to work on exactly what will make it into Trump\u2019s first legislative package. The newly passed House GOP plan calls for sweeping tax cuts, steep spending cuts and a two-year debt limit hike, as well as new money for border security and energy production. The Senate\u2019s plan, however, contains only national security and energy money, while punting on the more contentious items for later.\n\nThe stakes are high for GOP leaders: Trump is eager to pass his agenda as quickly as possible, even as party leaders must comply with the extremely strict constraints of the budget powers that allow their party to pass a package without Democratic votes. And Republicans will need to tread carefully on reforms to popular programs like Medicaid, food assistance and Pell grants \u2014 concerns that nearly sunk the budget plan this week.\n\nThe successful vote capped a dramatic 12 hours for Johnson. In the morning, he held a tense meeting with House Republicans to convince his members to back the budget blueprint or risk forgoing key parts of Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nBut by the afternoon, House GOP leaders were still struggling to lock down the votes, and even the relentlessly upbeat Johnson acknowledged he may need to pull it.\n\nThe votes weren\u2019t there around 7:30 p.m., when the speaker moved to scrap plans to hold the vote at all. But then his leadership team \u2014 with help from a Trump call to Rep. Victoria Spartz \u2014 was able to win over the last holdouts. So, just moments after dismissing members, Johnson called them back to vote and passed the GOP\u2019s budget blueprint.\n\nRep. Warren Davidson, an Ohio Republican, said he decided to change his vote after he received \u201cassurances\u201d of a future plan that could survive the Senate to trim discretionary spending, though he offered no specifics.\n\nAnd Spartz added that she spoke with Trump on health care issues, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s on board to get some great things done on health care. \u2026 I trust his word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the last few weeks are showing us how difficult it is to move any package through the House,\u201d Rep. Dusty Johnson, a leadership ally, acknowledged earlier Tuesday. \u201cThis is a motley crew.\u201d\n\nHours before the scheduled vote, hardline conservatives insisted there weren\u2019t enough spending cuts in the plan, even as centrist-leaning Republicans remained uneasy about the size of those cuts and whether they could impact popular programs like Medicaid. And Johnson\u2019s efforts to win support even backfired in some corners. Massie said he left a meeting Tuesday morning even more dug in against the budget than before.\n\n\u201cThey convinced me in there, I\u2019m a no,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said, holding up a thick packet of leadership talking points and railing against their plans line by line. By the time of the vote, Massie remained the only GOP \u201cno.\u201d\n\nJohnson and his whip team had spent the last several days trying to win over their more moderate members, many of whom had raised concerns that the budget plan could ultimately lead to cuts to the low-income health program Medicaid.\n\nAhead of the vote, Republicans from northeastern states were particularly wary of plans to cut $880 billion over a decade from federal health and energy programs, which they fear cannot be achieved without cutting Medicaid, the hugely expensive health program, since Trump has vowed not to touch Medicare.\n\nGOP leaders have strongly pushed back against the idea that benefits would be cut, noting that the budget plan is only a framework and not specific policy. They argue there are ways to cut hundreds of billions in wasted money on federal health programs without slashing Medicaid benefits, though it remains unclear where those cuts would come from.\n\n\u201cThis is a procedural vote. You tell me what the cuts are,\u201d House Majority Whip Tom Emmer told CNN when asked about swing seat lawmakers\u2019 concerns about Medicaid cuts.\n\nIn the end, Johnson only recorded a single Republican defection.\n\n\u201cWe will get there, as we always do,\u201d the speaker predicted earlier in the day, when he was still lacking at least a half-dozen votes.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Alison Main, Morgan Rimmer, Veronica Stracqualursi and Aileen Graef contributed to this report.",

            "content": "Books & the Arts / Ronald Johnson\u2019s American Romanticism An inheritor of a distinct tradition that stretched back to Coleridge and Emerson, Johnson\u2019s naturalistic poetry was immersive and intimate all at once.\n\nRonald Johnson.\n\n(Photo by Ralph Eugene Meatyard)\n\nEven those of us who enjoy Ralph Waldo Emerson will apologize for his poetry. His essays\u2014most of which began as lectures\u2014are erudite but predominantly concerned with honesty and connection. The poems, however, feel like they\u2019ve been written to be overheard by the adults in the next room. They are so sanctimonious that there\u2019s a perverse pleasure in seeing the many ways this brilliant thinker found to write awkwardly: with archaisms (\u201cI, in my pleached garden, watched the pomp\u201d); with pedantry (\u201cWho shall nerve heroic boys / To hazard all in Freedom\u2019s fight\u201d); with inept metaphors strung across rhymes so joyless and meter so clumsy that they seem like punishments:\n\nThey brought me rubies from the mine,\n\nAnd held them to the sun;\n\nI said, they are drops of frozen wine\n\nFrom Eden\u2019s vats that run.\n\nReviewing May-Day and Other Pieces (1867), from which I\u2019ve drawn my examples, William Dean Howells gave one of the better backhanded compliments in American literary history: \u201cMr. Emerson, perhaps, more than any other modern poet, gives the notion of inspiration; so that one doubts, in reading him, how much to praise or blame.\u201d But more than derivative or maladroit, Emerson\u2019s poems crucially omit the fragility visible within his famous self-reliance. We rarely meet the philosopher who broke down after the death of his son: \u201cI grieve that grief can teach me nothing, nor carry me one step into real nature.\u201d\n\nBooks in review Valley of the Many-Colored Grasses Buy this book\n\n\u201cWaldeinsamkeit\u201d is something else. A minor ballad in May-Day, its title is one of those German untranslatables whose literal sense, \u201cforest solitude,\u201d does not adequately convey the mutual compounding of isolation and belonging that the term connotes. It is more like: \u201cThe further that a traveler ventures into the woods, the less lonely they feel.\u201d Emerson understood this acutely:\n\nThere the great Planter plants\n\nOf fruitful worlds the grain,\n\nAnd with a million spells enchants\n\nThe souls that walk in pain.\n\nHere, he finds his proper tempo and subject, and uses that patience to give us a divine tautology (\u201cthe great Planter plants\u201d) at once commonsensical and deep. The Puritans called their colonies \u201cplantations\u201d in the sense of putting down roots, but the plural \u201cworlds\u201d implies that we live in just one possibility and should take care to help others to grow.\n\nThe poem first appeared in The Atlantic in October 1858, inspired by a visit to an island in Buzzards Bay during the previous summer. But between then and the book\u2019s appearance, Emerson suffered another terrible loss\u2014that of his unruly pupil Henry David Thoreau. Thoreau had, in fact, visited the Bay twice that same summer, seeking relief from the tuberculosis that would finally kill him in 1862. This poem feels like anticipatory mourning as well as words of comfort for his friend\u2019s lonely journey.\n\nI talked about \u201cWaldeinsamkeit\u201d with poet Stu Waton, the editor of Prelude magazine and a scholar of 19th-century poetry, who said, \u201cIt is possible to read the title and imagine Emerson had his disciple in mind, with the \u2018Wald-\u2019 invoking the site of Thoreau\u2019s \u2018experiment\u2019 on his own land at Walden Pond. But the poem also looks further back, to Wordsworth, particularly to his early lyrical ballad, \u2018Expostulation and Reply,\u2019 which makes a similar argument for the epistemological value to be found in an unadorned appreciation of nature.\u201d In this poem, the ecological operates as a refuge and a philosophical provocation\u2014bringing across the Atlantic the strain of Romantic thought that Coleridge had brought into the English language\u2014and also as a space where questioning the nature of knowledge can emerge from social specificity. Joining these registers is as old as the classical pastoral, but where Virgil\u2019s Eclogues took fictional shepherds idling in fields as the staging ground for philosophical commentary, Emerson smuggles the legacy of a particular friendship into a poem investigating how it is that human beings can feel more at home in the wild.\n\nIt was this version of American Romanticism that captivated a subset of gay avant-garde poets in the 1960s. Jonathan Williams\u2014mostly remembered for publishing Robert Creeley, Charles Olson, Mina Loy, and Denise Levertov\u2014referenced \u201cWaldeinsamkeit\u201d in his poem \u201cA Week From the Big Pigeon to the Little Tennessee River,\u201d which he wrote on the Appalachian Trail in late 1961. He was joined on the trail by his younger lover Ronald Johnson, who became the more prominent poet and assiduous inheritor of the American Romantic tradition, and whose earliest poetry was recently reissued by Song Cave, after being out of print for 63 years. One of the stand-outs in Valley of the Many-Colored Grasses ends by lineating the second paragraph of Emerson\u2019s essay on Goethe from Representative Men (1850), in which he compares writers to gardeners in terms of caring for the small while ever mindful of broader concerns like diversity, balance, and climate:\n\nNATURE WILL BE\n\n\n\nreported. All things\n\nare engaged in writing their history.\n\nThe air is\n\n\n\nfull of sounds;\n\nthe sky, of tokens\u2026\n\nAlthough nothing is added or taken away, Emerson\u2019s prose has been distilled in such a way that it\u2019s easy to understand why Williams called Johnson\u2019s style \u201cconcentrated seeing.\u201d It\u2019s not just that we can understand Emerson more clearly by slowing down, but that we have time to envision the air \u201cfull of sounds,\u201d imagining ourselves surrounded by the figures of speech. There\u2019s a counterintuitive correlative here, with the negative space of the page standing in for the cacophony that the poem reports on but stands apart from, allowing it to be contained by the book and the page but outside of language.\n\nJohnson wasn\u2019t the first to undertake such an experiment, though it was not yet a popular experiment either. When W.B. Yeats lineated a bit of Walter Pater, Robert Hillyer called it \u201ca pathetic instance of this attempt to be modern.\u201d Hillyer\u2019s frustration goes beyond taste\u2014it\u2019s not just about how a poem is made and how it looks, but about what it does and expects from us. Brazen intertextuality of the kind practiced by Yeats and Johnson takes the idea that poetry is \u201cthe scholar\u2019s art\u201d to a parodic extreme and troubles the expected relationship between originality and subjectivity. Such a poem is neither unoriginal nor disengaged from the poet\u2019s experience of the world, but we have to seek out these qualities and can\u2019t fall back on the influence-hunting of conventional literary-historical interpretation. The poet and critic Brian Kim Stefans has argued that \u201ceven an exhaustive tally of the intertextual qualities of a poem\u2026will never approach the event that should, and does, lie at its core,\u201d and we might imagine that Yeats and Johnson have taken care to exhaust the poem in advance, thus bringing us closer to that event.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other cheap global stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe geopolitical landscape has drastically changed since the beginning of the decade, with the COVID-19 pandemic followed by worldwide spikes in inflation leading to completely different economic tendencies if compared to the previous decade. The conflict in Ukraine brought even more geopolitical turmoil, with many analysts believing that this war represents the end of several political and economic alliances, notably between Europe and Russia on the one hand, and between the USA and China on the other hand. The first so-called alliance of the past led to strong economic growth in both the EU and Russia, as the former used cheap energy and commodities from Russia to fuel its industrial sector (particularly that of Germany), while Russia itself had the freedom to export its capital and source the technology and talent it needed for development. The second so-called alliance, between the USA and China, fueled unprecedented growth in China, in a journey to secure the American market and industry with cheap electronics, components, consumer products, and everything the country needed to grow its technological leadership.\n\nALSO READ: 10 Cheap New Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nAs the Ukraine conflict unfolded in Eastern Europe, some tendencies from the times of the Cold War proliferated again, with the East and the West isolating each other, as the USA and Europe aligned to support Ukraine, while China had the back of Russia. The aforementioned \u201cold\u201d alliances were shattered, and each region started to face new problems \u2013 the EU\u2019s energy security faced unprecedented risks, with energy prices skyrocketing across central and eastern Europe, leading to a slowdown in economic growth and tremendous pressure on the regular consumer. The US and China escalated the trade wars that had their roots in the previous decade \u2013 in an attempt to protect its technological leadership, particularly in the AI field, the US imposed restrictions to export semiconductor equipment used in the production of state-of-the-art chips, such as powerful GPUs to train AI models. China imposed some retaliatory restrictions regarding several strategic commodities sourced by the US. Even though the trade wars are still not fully enforced by both parties, the tensions persist and have deep implications for the financial markets and the global economy.\n\nAs geographic markets became more disconnected, the stock markets in the USA, Europe, and APAC had quite different performances, with the former leading by a wide margin in 2023-2024. For reference, the 5-year performance of the German stock market lagged that of the US by 57%, China lagged the US by 94%, and Japan lagged the US by 58%. In light of the proliferating geopolitical challenges, which still persist as the new Trump 2.0 administration threatens tariffs on its supposed allies as well as China again, we believe that global companies that are diversified across geographies will be the most favored in the years to come, due to stronger potential to diversify idiosyncratic risk. Furthermore, as the US stock market is currently near all-time highs after a stellar 2023-2024 period, cheap companies trading under 15.0x forward P/E might be the only viable option to buy in the current expensive market. Successful investors like Warren Buffet acknowledged that an overstretched valuation could hinder the subsequent performance of a stock. Here\u2019s precisely what he said during his 1998 letter to shareholders:\n\n\u201cFor the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used a Finviz screener to filter the largest stocks trading at under 15x forward P/E and analyzed the companies\u2019 filings in order to identify 7 promising global companies that generated at least 40% of revenue in the last financial year from outside the US. For each company, we also include the number of hedge funds that own the company as of Q4 2024 and rank them in ascending order.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nForward P/E ratio as of February 24th: 14.81x\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 98\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a global healthcare giant with a diversified portfolio spanning pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health products. Known for its strong brand presence and research-driven approach, JNJ has built a reputation for innovation in areas like immunology, oncology, and surgical technology. The company recently restructured by spinning off its consumer health division, Kenvue, to sharpen its focus on higher-margin pharmaceutical and medtech businesses. With a robust pipeline of new therapies and a defensive business model, JNJ remains a key player in the healthcare sector, benefiting from stable demand and long-term demographic trends. It is one of the best cheap global stocks to monitor.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) maintains confidence in achieving 3% growth in 2025 and 5-7% compound average growth from 2025 to 2030, which is above the historical average. The company\u2019s success is built on two foundational elements: a clear purpose through its credo and a broadly diversified healthcare model. The acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, announced in January, is expected to lift sales growth through the rest of the decade, with CAPLYTA projected to become a $5 billion asset. In the pharmaceutical segment, management expects to have 10 assets with peak year sales exceeding $5 billion by decade\u2019s end, with 70% of pipeline assets already in Phase III. The MedTech business is positioned for growth, with 50% of sales now in markets growing more than 5%, and by 2027, one-third of sales are expected to come from new products.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\u2019s multiple myeloma franchise is anticipated to become a $25 billion franchise by the end of the decade, with approximately 50% share of Johnson & Johnson regimens. The company maintains financial strength to pursue deals while addressing other capital allocation priorities like dividends, though larger deals are considered outliers with the majority of value creation coming through smaller, tuck-in acquisitions. Despite the optimistic long-term outlook and guidance, JNJ still trades at a cheap 14.81x forward P/E.\n\nOverall, JNJ ranks 2nd on our list of cheap global stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JNJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The biosimilar, dubbed Pyzchiva, launched Monday.\n\nJ&J did not name the third-party provider in its complaint, only revealing that it is subsidiary of a \u201cvertically integrated health conglomerate\u201d that includes one of the largest insurers and providers in the U.S. The conglomerate also counts among its members one of the biggest pharmacy chains in the country and a pharmacy benefit manager.\n\nThe pharma stated that Samsung Bioepis\u2019 agreement with this conglomerate was a \u201csurreptitious and deliberate breach\u201d of the contract, one that \u201cthreatens irreparable harm\u201d to J&J, including the \u201csignificant diminution\u201d of Stelara\u2019s market share.

J&J is seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction against the deal between Samsung and its external partner, plus compensatory damages.\n\nMonday\u2019s lawsuit comes as J&J contends with the growing number of Stelara biosimilars entering the U.S. market, threatening to erode the blockbuster drug\u2019s market dominance. Also on Monday\u2014alongside Samsung\u2019s Pyzchiva\u2014Biocon Biologics launched its Stelara biosimilar Yesintek. Ahead of the curve is Amgen, whose Wezlana launched last month and has the FDA\u2019s interchangeability designation, meaning it can be swapped in for the reference product without needing to change the prescription.\n\nThere are several others, including Accord BioPharma\u2019s Imuldosa, Teva and Alvotech\u2019s Selarsdi and Celltrion\u2019s Steqeyma.\n\nAnticipating a decline in Stelara sales, J&J has started leaning on its other assets, including the anti-IL23 and anti-CD64 therapy Tremfya, which in September 2024 won the FDA\u2019s approval for severe active ulcerative colitis.",

            "content": "The rift between Mayor Brandon Johnson and the inspector general he inherited got wider Tuesday over efforts to remove what chief watchdog Deborah Witzburg views as roadblocks impeding her internal investigations.\n\nCorporation Counsel Mary Richardson-Lowry fired back two weeks after Witzburg accused Johnson and his predecessor Lori Lightfoot of withholding documents, selectively enforcing subpoenas and demanding to have the Law Department sit in on interviews that \u201crisk embarrassment\u201d to the mayor.\n\nIt happened after Richardson-Lowry was asked to explain why she and Johnson are holding up an ordinance introduced by Ald. Matt Martin (47th), the mayor\u2019s hand-picked Ethics Committee chairman. That proposal is tailor-made to remove the investigative impediments Witzburg cited by implementing every change she asked the City Council to make.\n\nNo longer would the Law Department be free to invoke attorney-client privilege or pick and choose which subpoenas from the inspector general are complied with. There would be \u201cno room for discretion\u201d concerning IG subpoenas, just as there isn\u2019t with subpoenas issued by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability.\n\nAnd the mayor\u2019s lawyers could no longer intimidate witnesses in cases involving employees of the mayor\u2019s office by demanding to sit in on their interviews with the inspector general\u2019s office.\n\nRichardson-Lowry argued Martin\u2019s ordinance is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with state law and the municipal code. It also violates an Illinois Supreme Court decision and removes \u201c30 years of guardrails\u201d that have provided \u201cprotections afforded every city worker.\u201d\n\nIt also \u201cundermines a fundamental principle that is sacrosanct\u201d for city attorneys who are \u201cpublic servants \u2014 not political animals.\u201d\n\nRequests for subpoenas are analyzed to determine whether \u201cevidentiary standards\u201d are met, the corporation counsel said. When the inspector general\u2019s request does not meet that standard, it \u201cgets sent back to the department\u201d for more evidence by attorneys with \u201clicenses to protect,\u201d she said.\n\nJust because the inspector general \u201cadvances an item for our review or prosecution\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the request should be granted without \u201clegal analysis,\u201d Richardson-Lowry said. To do so would be \u201cinconsident with the attorney-client privilege we\u2019re obligated to uphold,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complete departure from every head of that office from my memory. ... It reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the law and of the obligations of that office. But mostly, it would dismantle guardrails so that the person charged with looking at fraud waste and abuse would become an abuser. That can\u2019t be allowed,\u201d she said.\n\nStill from a video released by the office of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson showing the room at City Hall where gifts to the mayor are stored. Investigators from the office of the inspector general were denied access to the room by the mayor\u2019s staff during an IG investigation. City of Chicago\n\n\u201cIf what comes over is deficient, what that means is there is a person that would be prosecuted inappropriately. We can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s inconsistent with how every other federal body operates \u2014 and I see them all. No one \u2026 has taken that posture.\u201d\n\nWitzburg stood her ground.\n\nShe said she has been working to remove impediments to her internal investigations for years and raised the issue with Johnson\u2019s transition team and in her first meeting with Richardson-Lowry.\n\nWitzburg agreed she is requesting a trailblazing change, but only because \u201cnone of us is here to do our jobs the same way our predecessors did them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNo one should look out at the government accountability landscape in Chicago and in Illinois right now and think that the status-quo is good enough.\u201d\n\nWitzburg also argued there is \u201cnothing radical\u201d about her proposed changes, which simply \u201cbring Chicago into line with national standards and federal law.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we have done so far isn\u2019t good enough. We live in a city where the `Chicago Way\u2019 is a proper noun. We live in a city where the government operates at a tremendous deficit of legitimacy. We\u2019re not gonna change that by wishing it away,\u201d the inspector general said.\n\n\u201cWhat goes on now means that the mayor\u2019s lawyers choose who is subject to investigation and who isn\u2019t. What records are subject to oversight and which aren\u2019t. We can\u2019t do it that way. Oversight cannot be limited by political interests.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s heated debate fanned the flames of tensions between the mayor and his internal watchdog that exist, no matter who is sitting on the fifth floor of City Hall. Inspectors general serve four-year terms. Witzburg\u2019s is up in April 2026.\n\nJoe Ferguson, a former federal prosecutor, served together with former Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office. When he was appointed by former Mayor Richard M. Daley in 2009 to replace departing Inspector General David Hoffman, Lightfoot was among those who recommended him.\n\nThat close relationship initially raised questions about just how independent Ferguson would be in a Lightfoot administration. But it wasn\u2019t long before Ferguson\u2019s aggressive investigations alienated Lightfoot. The two clashed openly and repeatedly, and she ultimately forced him out.\n\n",

            "content": "In December, Jake Johnson and Gareth Reynolds announced that their advice podcast, We\u2019re Here to Help, would be coming to a temporary end. The duo had released more than 140 episodes, sometimes devoting five hours a day to recording, and it became unsustainable. Reynolds, a touring comedian, was often Zooming in from the road and Johnson was in the midst of producing a new movie. It made sense to hit pause.\n\n\u201cIt kept growing and it got way bigger than I expected,\u201d Johnson says, speaking from his home studio in Los Angeles. \u201cIt got better, bigger, and we kept changing it.\u201d\n\nReynolds, on the call while in his parked car, also in Los Angeles, adds, \u201cSuddenly we were doing two a week, instead of one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt became way more of a job than I originally thought it was,\u201d Johnson continues. \u201cWe felt like the energy we had to put in the show, because we both really care about the material, was just not as great. We thought, \u2018If we don\u2019t have the time to do this right and if we\u2019re not going to do it right, let\u2019s not do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re Here to Help launched in August of 2023 as a casual advice podcast with Johnson and Reynolds as co-hosts. The duo took questions from callers and offered potential solutions, although, as Reynolds noted in the premiere, \u201cWe really make no guarantees.\u201d It aired twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays, and it quickly evolved to include guest hosts, like Johnson\u2019s New Girl co-stars Lamorne Morris and Zooey Deschanel, and accompanying video versions on YouTube filmed in a studio. Soon, there were more than 100 episodes.\n\nBefore the 2024 holidays, Johnson announced the culmination of Season One, telling listeners they intended to bring the podcast back at some point in the future, but were unclear when. Typically, that would be that. Instead, the show\u2019s fans sent in thousands of emails, begging Johnson and Reynolds to reevaluate.\n\n\u201cThere were so many going like, \u2018Come on you assholes, you can\u2019t do one a month?\u2019\u201d Johnson says, laughing. \u201c[It was] a staggering response to a couple of 40-year-old babies saying \u2018We can\u2019t do this.\u2019\u201d Editor\u2019s picks\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re better at the show, which makes it more fun\u201d\n\nThe solution came surprisingly easily. Podcast network Headgum called and offered a 52-episode deal for 2025. The show would run as one episode per week on Mondays (although Johnson and Reynolds say they might air bonus episodes on occasional Thursdays). There would be no YouTube component, although fans can still subscribe to the podcast\u2019s Patreon for video. For Season Two, the hosts brought in \u201cnew blood\u201d behind the scenes and shifted the format of the show back to its roots: Johnson and Reynolds offering advice to callers together, with only the occasional guest (so far Michael Cera has shown up in Season Two). It\u2019s far fewer hours recording and, as they are quick to admit, much more enjoyable.\n\n\u201cNow that we\u2019re doing Season Two, it does not feel like the [same] level of work doing one a week,\u201d Reynolds explains. \u201cAnd it feels like we\u2019re a little bit better at doing the show, which makes it more fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I love about this is it can keep changing and growing, and there\u2019s no rules to it,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThere\u2019s no real studio behind us. We don\u2019t control our ads, but we do control the creative output.\u201d\n\nThe hosts were generally aware of the community they\u2019d built with We\u2019re Here to Help since it launched in the fall of 2023. But Johnson was more surprised by the intense reaction than Reynolds, who regularly comes face to face with the fans while doing stand-up. Related Content\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like the candidate out on the road shaking hands,\u201d Reynolds says. \u201cThe thing with podcasts is that para-social relationship really is so vastly different than anything else. Jake obviously was on one of the biggest TV shows of the last 15 years, and that is enormous fame. But the podcast fans are different. You listened to me for 1,000 hours? That is ungodly.\u201d\n\nReynolds, a writer for TV shows like Arrested Development and You\u2019re the Worst, came up with the idea for We\u2019re Here to Help during the 2023 SAG and WGA strikes, when many in the entertainment industry were forced to pivot. He and Johnson had been friends for more than 15 years after meeting at the Los Angeles dive bar Ye Rustic Inn, and spent a lot of time sharing advice with each other about their careers. At the time, Johnson, best known for playing Nick Miller on New Girl, had recently transitioned into directing \u2014 his directorial feature debut, Self Reliance, arrived in early 2024 \u2014 and was also waiting out the strikes.\n\n\u201cI texted Jake and I was like, \u2018If you ever wanted to, we could do this show together,\u2019\u201d Reynolds remembers. \u201cI said, \u2018It would fit our strengths in a way that a podcast favors.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe debut episode, \u201cThe Quest of Wilhelmina,\u201d set the tone for what was to come. It featured fans calling in with problems, similar to many advice shows, but the approach was refreshingly off-kilter. Their first query: How could a caller give her Dungeons and Dragons character more \u201cnerd clout\u201d? Not only did Johnson and Reynolds take their roles seriously, talking to the caller for the entire 30-minute episode, but they gave her actionable advice: Improve her German accent to make the character more memorable. As the episodes continued, the pair\u2019s producer only selected questions that were unserious \u2014 and hilarious.\n\n\u201cIn earnest, we are trying to solve the problem\u201d\n\nSince the podcast launched, Johnson and Reynolds have talked to callers about everything from horrible wedgies, to getting caught masturbating on a security camera while cat sitting, to a coworker who won\u2019t wear shoes. Reynold\u2019s solution to the latter? Pour a jar of parmesan cheese on the floor under her colleague\u2019s desk so it would get on her bare feet and, hopefully, encourage her to wear shoes.\n\n\u201cIn earnest, we are trying to solve the problem,\u201d Reynolds insists. \u201cWe might make fun of the other one\u2019s ideas. We might even poke fun at why someone is passing on an idea, but our heart truly is in the right place.\u201d\n\nJohnson adds, \u201cI don\u2019t think either of us ever want to make fun of the caller because we have too much fun making fun of each other. The whole fun for me is seeing if we can solve the problem. I think that push pull between me and [Gareth] is fun. Sometimes he\u2019ll pitch something as if he\u2019s being serious, but I know he\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nHe pauses, reluctantly adding, \u201cThat\u2019s how we get to parmesan-ing the floor.\u201d\n\nIn the infamous parmesan episode, \u201cSeeing Past the Piggies,\u201d both hosts\u2019 ideas became increasingly weird. Reynolds first suggested the caller claim to have seen spiders on the floor and maybe been bitten by one. That led Johnson to chime in, \u201cWhat about releasing a rat?\u201d (Not possible due to security cameras in the office.) Other thoughts from Reynolds: the caller could clip her toenails to \u201cout weird\u201d her coworker.\n\n\u201cParmesan-ing the floor resonated with America because it was a good pitch,\u201d Reynolds says, insistently. (He says that fans frequently show up to his stand-up shows with actual cans of parmesan cheese.) \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s good to give them the worst pitch so they know how good the other ones are. Sometimes we throw out a dog shit pitch and then the person will be like, \u2018Yeah, you know, I am going put the \u2018fuck you\u2019 Post-It note on their door. Godspeed.\u201d\n\nNow with nearly 150 episodes released, We\u2019re Here to Help has not only established a loyal following, but also an extended universe. There are jokes and characters that recur, sometimes months later, and certain callers, like the infamous Connor, who is always in a different bizarre living situation, pop back in every once in a while. Recently, a caller recorded a song, \u201cThe Ballad of Mrs. Gingerbread,\u201d specifically for the podcast after having her problem solved. The hosts have played the song at the end of multiple recent episodes.\n\n\u201cThat world building was a huge component of the fun,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThere\u2019s a selfish part to that because we enjoy it. And if something becomes less fun, it fades away.\u201d\n\nReynolds adds, \u201cThe world building was there right away. It was very good for the show to have returning callers and to keep hearing back from people.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re Here to Help receives around 40 emails per week asking for advice, which a producer then goes through to select people who will be asked to call in; Johnson and Reynolds don\u2019t know the question ahead of recording. Although the hosts are on camera, the caller is not. The pair usually ask callers for their name, location, and age before getting into the issue. Recently, Johnson has enjoyed asking about the caller\u2019s favorite jungle animal \u2014 an ice-breaker to make them more comfortable.\n\n\u201cI try to slow it down and get to know everybody,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s like the beginning of a date. Because a lot of times you\u2019re really trying to find out the \u2018why\u2019 behind a call.\u201d\n\nOccasionally, things have gone sideways \u2014 like the time Reynolds spent an episode hitting on Johnson\u2019s mom, or when comedian Steve Berg interrupted a serious moment from a caller when his roast chicken caught fire in the oven. These derailments are partly why Season Two has re-focused on the dynamic between Johnson and Reynolds instead of relying too much on guests.\n\n\u201cThe caller should be the main person, but if there\u2019s a guest we\u2019re honoring the guest,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cWe understand you\u2019re Sarah from Maine, but Jimmy Kimmel is here!\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s pretty straight down the middle and then other times it\u2019s totally bananas,\u201d Reynolds admits. \u201cThere have been ones where we are like, \u2018Yep, that was out of control.\u2019\u201d\n\nOne of those episodes occurred when the hosts and their guest Morris, who played Winston on New Girl, were asked for help with a wedding speech. Morris recorded multiple takes of a video of a completely unhinged speech for the caller to play at the wedding, one of which they actually did. Among his sage pieces of wisdom: \u201cNow I\u2019ve been married, I wanna say 10 times, all successful marriages. And the one thing that I learned that you gotta do to keep that thing spicy in the bedroom is don\u2019t brush your teeth. So if you don\u2019t brush your teeth, you know what real love is.\u201d It did not go over well.\n\n\u201cWe are aware \u2014 and we weren\u2019t at the beginning \u2014 that these are people\u2019s real lives,\u201d Johnson says.\n\nSometimes, listening to the podcast feels like being in on an inside joke. The audience becomes a part of recurring bits and guest hosts like Morris, Berg, and Eric Edelstein are friends with Johnson and Reynolds outside the show, leading to a familiar dynamic. The hosts\u2019 actual friendship helps too.\n\n\u201cPart of it with Gareth and I is that we have known each other now for over 20 years and there are so many inside jokes between us via text,\u201d Johnson continues. \u201cAnd for Gareth and I, the game is like: How do we keep changing so that we\u2019re making each other laugh? As long as we\u2019re loving it and the audience is loving it, why wouldn\u2019t you keep going? It seems like a perfect game.\u201d Trending Stories Tesla Owners Are Desperately Trying to Disguise Their Cars Justin Bieber Admits He Feels 'Unqualified and Unequipped' in Candid Post Amid Concerns About His Health Gutting the Department of Education Is as Cruel as It Is Stupid Can Trump Arbitrarily Take Money From Anyone\u2019s Bank Account?\n\nGoing forward, the hosts are certain We\u2019re Here to Help will continue to evolve. They\u2019ve developed a solid base (Reynolds\u2019 favorite joke is to call the show \u201cAmerica\u2019s number one podcast, don\u2019t look it up\u201d), but there\u2019s room to grow. Co-stars from Johnson\u2019s undisclosed forthcoming movie might show up. But regardless, the duo feel good about how the podcast has developed.\n\n\u201cWhen people listen to our show, they mostly dig it,\u201d Reynolds says, confidently. \u201cMostly.\u201d",

Tim Burchett, Warren Davidson and Victoria Spartz, three of four holdouts. The other, Rep. Thomas Massie, was the only Republican who voted against the resolution. Republicans could afford to lose only one vote.\n\n\"A lot of work yet to be done, but we're going to celebrate tonight, and we'll roll up our sleeves and get right back at it in the morning,\" Johnson said to reporters after the vote.\n\nIt was not clear whether Republicans would have the votes to pass the measure on Tuesday afternoon and into the evening. At least four Republicans members had said they would vote no on the plan and Johnson could afford only one defection.\n\nHouse Republicans held open their first vote Tuesday night for more than an hour as leadership tried to wrangle votes for the funding resolution and Democrats protested.\n\nGOP leaders then briefly pulled the budget resolution -- the next vote in a series -- from the schedule and rescheduled it a few minutes later and called the entire House back to the chamber.\n\nDemocratic leaders were able to get more of their members to attend the critical vote. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, who is on maternity leave, showed up to vote with her son. Rep. Kevin Mullin, who has a medical condition, showed up with a walker. House Democratic leaders complained in a message to Democrats that Johnson was trying to \u201cjam\u201d the budget resolution through after assuring them there would be no further votes in the House for the night.\n\nBefore the vote, Johnson told reporters, \"We are trying to work through concerns and issues. A lot of people want to make sure we are cutting an appropriate amount \u2026 it's a very complicated negotiation \u2026 we will get there.\"\n\nThe resolution now heads to the Senate, where it is an open question as to what leadership will do with the blueprint. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has a different approach in the upper chamber -- focusing one bill on defense and border security spending and a later one that would deal with tax cuts and the debt ceiling, although the president has wholly endorsed the House Republican blueprint.\n\nRepublicans plan to use reconciliation, a tactic that requires only a simple majority to pass. But under reconciliation, both chambers must adopt the exact same resolution.\n\n\"This is the first important step in opening up the reconciliation process. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us,\" Johnson said after the vote. \"We are going to deliver the America First agenda. We're going to deliver all of it, not just parts of it, and this is the first step of that process.\"\n\nRepublicans leaned on Trump to pressure the holdouts and other GOP members who were undecided.\n\n\"The president has talked to a number of members. He's made his intentions well known and he wants them to vote for this and move it along so we can start the process,\" Johnson said.\n\nBut later Tuesday, while signing executive orders in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm not involved in that. They know what I want.\"\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) delivers remarks after the House passed the Republican's budget resolution on the spending bill on Feb. 25, 2025 at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n\nBurchett told ABC News that he spoke to Trump, but declined to divulge details on the conversation.\n\nJohnson earlier was uncertain if the vote would happen Tuesday, suggesting it could get pushed.\n\n\"There may be a vote tonight. There may not be. Stay tuned. That's why you get paid. Hang around here,\" he said to reporters.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise defended the budget -- contending that Democrats were \"lying\" when they asserted that Republicans are primed to make deep cuts to Medicaid.\n\n\"This bill doesn't even mention the word 'Medicaid' a single time, and yet, all Democrats are doing is lying about what's in the budget because they don't want to talk about the truth,\" Scalise said. \"Instead of just sitting back and licking their wounds that they're completely out of touch with the American people, their only choice is to resort to lying about what's in this vote today. There is no Medicaid in this bill. There are no Medicaid cuts in this bill. Yet that's all they're saying.\"\n\nWhile the blueprint itself does not mention Medicaid directly, it sets a goal of at least $2 trillion in cuts to mandatory federal spending, which includes funding for entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.\n\nUS House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, holds a copy of the House Republican's budget bill during a press conference following the Republican Conference meeting, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on Feb. 25, 2025. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nJohnson and his leadership team worked for weeks to mollify concerns.\n\nFollowing a closed-door conference meeting Tuesday, Massie quipped that GOP leaders have \"convinced him\" to vote no -- predicting the measure would actually increase the deficit by billions of dollars.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie speaks to reporters as she arrives for a House Republican caucus meeting at the U.S. Capitol, on Feb. 25, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nNevertheless, Johnson defended the blueprint.\n\n\"The objective and our commitment has always been deficit neutrality. That's the goal here. If we can reduce the deficit, even better,\" Johnson said responding to accusations that the plan would increase the deficit.\n\nSome additional Republicans were undecided, including New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, stressing she was acting on behalf of her aging constituency.\n\n\"I'm still undecided, but I'm leaning more towards yes because I've gotten some clarity and assurances that make me feel comfortable allowing this process to move forward,\" she said. \"We have to make sure that leadership includes those of us who have large Medicaid populations in that process.\"\n\nSelf-proclaimed \"budget hawk\" Georgia Rep. Rich McCormick said earlier he was still \"in discussions\" on whether or not to back the resolution.\n\n\"I'd like us to be more aggressive on spending cuts so we can save on things like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,\" he said.\n\n\"I am trying to figure out exactly what this entails\u2026 how this bill is going to affect the actual hard numbers, and that's what I'm interested in,\" he said.\n\nHouse Democrats gathered on the Capitol steps Tuesday afternoon to protest an \"assault\" on democracy and the \"reckless Republican budget.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries led the group of lawmakers, declaring that Democrats have unified their opposition against the measure.\n\n\"So let me be clear, House Democrats will not provide a single vote to this reckless Republican budget, not one, not one, not one. They will not get a single Democratic vote. Why? Because we're voting with the American people,\" he said.\n\nJeffries said the GOP budget plan \"represents the largest Medicaid cut in American history,\" adding that \"children will be devastated. Families will be devastated. People with disabilities will be devastated. Seniors will be devastated. Hospitals will be devastated; nursing homes will be devastated.\"\n\n\"Everything we care about is under assault. The economy is under assault. The safety net is under assault. Our very way of life as a country is under assault. Democracy itself is under assault.

            "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday muscled a multitrillion-dollar budget blueprint through the House by the narrowest of margins \u2014 a crucial step for Republicans as they embark on advancing President Donald Trump\u2019s legislative agenda.\n\nThe vote was 217-215, with Republicans casting all of the votes in favor of the budget resolution. Just one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., joined all Democrats in voting against it.\n\nThe vote came after a dramatic day of arm-twisting in the House, with Johnson hosting multiple meetings in his office to win over GOP holdouts and Trump personally calling many of those same individuals.\n\nMike Johnson at the U.S. Capitol on Feb. 24, 2025. Kent Nishimura / Getty Images\n\n\"We got it done,\" Johnson said after the vote. \"This is the first important step in opening up the reconciliation process. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us. We are going to deliver the America First agenda.\"The budget measure calls for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and a goal of $2 trillion in spending cuts. It includes more than $100 billion in new spending on immigration enforcement and the military.\n\nIt also requires the House Energy and Commerce Committee to find $880 billion in cuts to federal programs, and Republicans say some of that will come from reducing spending on Medicaid. And it raises the debt limit by $4 trillion.\n\nThree conservative rebels who had been publicly opposed to the budget framework \u2014 Reps. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Victoria Spartz of Indiana, and Warren Davidson of Ohio \u2014 ultimately flipped and voted in favor of it.\n\n\"There's no quid pro quo but the president assured me that he would work toward cuts and he's never lied to me,\" Burchett, who had expressed concern over the level of spending cuts the resolution would allow for, said after the vote. \"He's always been honest about it.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday evening, in a chaotic moment, House Republican leaders appeared to briefly cancel the budget vote and send members home for the night, only to abruptly call up the vote and bring lawmakers back to the floor minutes later.\n\nAfter the vote, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., described how Trump had played an instrumental role in flipping some of the last-minute holdouts.\n\n\u201cTrump helped us with a number of members. Look, Trump has been an incredible ally in this whole process. Talking to anybody that we asked that really needed to clarify things,\u201d Scalise told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about who Trump talked to and what they talked about. I wasn\u2019t privy to those conversations.\u201d\n\nScalise also explained what happened during a bizarre episode that left even veteran observers of the House scratching their heads.\n\nGOP leaders had spent nearly an hour on the floor trying to wrangle votes, and at one point brought holdouts into the private cloakroom for further conversations. With those rebels refusing to budge, the leaders decided to skip the budget resolution in a series of three votes that were scheduled Tuesday evening, then told lawmakers there were no more votes for the night. But as they streamed out of the Capitol, lawmakers began receiving email notifications, texts and calls that the vote was back on.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t ready yet so we went on to the third bill,\" Scalise said, \"and then still had to make sure we were there before we made the decision to call everybody back and then bring up the budget.\u201d\n\nThe successful vote puts the ball back in the Senate\u2019s court. Because Trump has endorsed the House budget plan, the Senate will be under pressure to take up and pass that blueprint, even though the upper chamber adopted its own version last week.\n\nUnder reconciliation, the process Republicans are using to attempt to enact Trump's policy priorities on a party-line basis, both chambers need to pass the same budget resolution before committees can officially draft the legislative package.\n\nThe fate of the House's resolution was uncertain for much of the day. In addition to the small band of conservatives who cited concerns over spending levels, more moderate Republicans expressed worry over potential cuts to Medicaid. But after a full day of meetings with Johnson and after Trump himself began calling holdouts, some of them began to soften their opposition.\n\n\u201cHe was a big help, as always,\u201d a smiling Johnson said of Trump as he left the House floor.\n\nDemocrats unified in opposition to the GOP budget plan, slamming it as a tax cut for the wealthy that will hurt working-class families by cutting Medicaid. They have coalesced around that political message intended to drive a wedge between Trump and swing voters, as well as his own voters who rely on federal benefits.\n\n\u201cThe House Republican budget resolution will set in motion the largest Medicaid cut in American history,\u201d House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters after the vote.\n\nEarly Tuesday afternoon, the House advanced the budget resolution on a procedural vote of 217-211, which set up the final vote Tuesday evening. Four Democrats and one Republican did not vote, giving Johnson some extra breathing room.\n\nBut three of the Democrats who had missed that vote and others \u2014 Reps. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado, Kevin Mullin of California and Frederica Wilson of Florida \u2014 unexpectedly showed up for the final budget vote, adding an extra wrinkle for Johnson and the Republicans.\n\nPettersen gave birth to her second child last month, while Mullin recently had knee surgery. Wilson said she had been attending to \"family matters.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, Republican Leadership denied my ability to vote remotely after giving birth to my son, Sam, but that\u2019s not stopping us from showing up to vote NO on this disastrous budget proposal,\" Pettersen posted on X, along with a photo of her with her baby.\n\n\"After 3 surgeries, a blood clot, an infection, & being hospitalized for over a week \u2014 the moment I was discharged from the hospital, I immediately rushed to the airport so I could fly to D.C. and vote NO on Republicans\u2019 disastrous budget plan,\" Mullin added on X.\n\nThe House's vote Tuesday to adopt a budget blueprint is merely one step of a complicated process Republican lawmakers are undertaking to advance Trump's agenda. Both the House and Senate must adopt the same resolution before committees can craft a massive party-line bill. The Senate voted for a different budget resolution that dealt with the border, defense and energy, while leaving taxes for a separate measure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a first step in the process,\u201d the House's tax-writing Ways & Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., told NBC News. \u201cWe did something that people didn\u2019t think we could do. We passed a budget resolution.\u201c",

It is also very expensive. How I Didn\u2019t Die: My Day at Bryan Johnson\u2019s Immortality Summit It turns out that optimizing yourself like artificial intelligence not only won\u2019t ensure that you live forever. It is also very expensive.\n\nBryan Johnson, founder and chief executive officer of Kernel Holding SA.\n\n(Kyle Grillot / Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s 9:30 am, and I am doing calisthenics on the lower level of the Javits Center. I am at New York City\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Die\u201d Summit, a conference focusing on anti-aging and life extension organized by tech millionaire Bryan Johnson. A 48-year-old ex-Mormon, Johnson has spent years proselytizing his $2 million-a-year diet, exercise, and medical testing regimen as the key to living long enough to enjoy \u201cour shared future with AI.\u201d Now, like a circuit rider, he\u2019s taking his show on the road, preaching the gospel of living forever in Los Angeles, New York, and Miami. Johnson and his longevity business represent how tech money, scientific half-truths, and optimization culture all converge into a new religion for those wealthy enough to worship at its altar.\n\nThe day\u2019s agenda promises many pleasures. We will begin with a lecture titled \u201cLife System and Habits to Build your Future Self\u201d led by Johnson and a medical doctor named Mike Mallin. Next is a lunch provided by Blueprint, Johnson\u2019s proprietary health protocol, which offers supplements, meal plans, and fitness guidance. Then comes a session called \u201cRoast My Protocol,\u201d in which attendees can get expert feedback on their personal health routines, followed by a singalong and dance party. Between 3 and 3:30 pm, according to the schedule, we are supposed to \u201cmake new friends.\u201d All of this for the low, low price of $249\u2014the cost of a general admission ticket at the early-bird rate. (But don\u2019t fret, you can pay up to $1,799 for an ultra-premium ticket, which gets you a gift bag and an unspecified \u201cExclusive Don\u2019t Die Experience\u201d with Johnson himself.)\n\nFor now, I focus on \u201cFitness Bioage Testing,\u201d a series of self-administered physical challenges said to reveal our biological (as opposed to chronological) age. I sit in a sea of black yoga mats, each equipped with a pink tape measure, a wooden ruler, and a grip-strength testing apparatus. An energetic young woman, shouting over a generic techno track, cues us through seven fitness challenges designed to test our strength, balance, reaction time, and flexibility. We are not to rest or modify the exercises in any way\u2014though with only one instructor and probably over a hundred of us, who would know? The participants\u2014among them, many gorgeous women clad head to toe in Lululemon\u2014earnestly perform push-up after push-up. After each exercise, we dutifully record our results on the \u201cDon\u2019t Die\u201d placards we received when we checked in upstairs using a tiny Sharpie. This numerical data, once entered into the Don\u2019t Die phone app, will allow it to calculate our body\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d age.\n\nMy results are disappointing. Not only am I out of shape\u2014I am reluctant to compromise my journalistic mission by becoming repugnantly sweaty an hour into the day\u2019s events. I do only two push-ups before giving up, then illegally use my hands to support myself during the \u201csit-rise\u201d test. The Don\u2019t Die app tells me my biological age is 53.3, even though, in real life, I am only 38. Some individual test results are even more worrying, implying that I am an \u201cadult in [my] 70s,\u201d even as what the placard whimsically calls my \u201cwaste-to-height ratio\u201d likens me to a \u201cfemale in [my] teens.\u201d As a 29-year-old graduate student in Germany, I was once tempted by a novelty T-shirt reading, \u201cSo gut kann man mit 60 aussehen!\u201d (Here\u2019s how good you can look at 60!), with a red arrow pointing to the wearer\u2019s face. The results of the Don\u2019t Die Bioage Test are making me wish I\u2019d bought it after all.\n\nEngrossed in detangling the tape measure that is supposed to help assess my flexibility, I miss the moment when Bryan Johnson himself enters the room. He is shorter than I imagined, but even more waxen-looking. Smiling beatifically, he works the crowd, followed at every step by a glowering man in a skinny black tie. After administering a few high fives, he departs, wishing us luck (\u201chope you\u2019re all young!\u201d) and promising to see us again at the dance partyscheduled for the afternoon. As we toil on our mats, the workout leader reminds us that, appearances to the contrary, \u201cBryan is here. Bryan is watching.\u201d\n\nWe see Johnson again shortly, at the day\u2019s first lecture. He is onstage, beaming, in front of a thousand-odd people, all eager to learn how to live forever. From where I sit, behind rows of $600-and-up Premium seats, he is a speck. He wears a T-shirt emblazoned with the name of his movement, \u201cDon\u2019t Die,\u201d and baggy black pants that would be right at home in a Delia*s catalogue from 1996. Next to Johnson is a very fit man in his early 50s. He also wears a \u201cDon\u2019t Die\u201d T-shirt and has the blank, unsmiling blue eyes and faux-casual cadence of an experienced salesman. This is Johnson\u2019s \u201clead doctor,\u201d Mike Mallin\u2014Dr. Mike for short. Once an emergency room physician, he \u201cleft academics for private practice in 2017\u201d and now runs a concierge medical service called Wild Health.\n\nToday, Dr. Mike has something he must urgently confess to us, his thousand closest friends: he has a love-hate relationship with Extra Toasty Cheez-Its\u2122. After a recent work trip, his overtired brain made him buy an entire bag of this product and consume half of it at once. Luckily, he soon realized what he was doing, and tossed the remaining Extra Toasty Cheez-Its\u2122 into the trash, where they belong. Johnson is magnanimous. Dr. Mike is not in the throes of an eating disorder; he has just suffered a temporary setback. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, Dr. Mike,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cWe accept you. It\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nTaking their cues from Johnson and Mallin, audience members now take the mic and confess to their own food-related \u201cdebaucheries,\u201d as Johnson calls them. One man worries that an upcoming trip to Vegas will provide him with too many opportunities to imbibe. \u201cMy weakness isn\u2019t alcohol,\u201d he reveals. \u201cIt\u2019s free stuff.\u201d Another man, who calls himself \u201cBoston Jim,\u201d tells the group his father died 10 days ago, and as a result, he ate a \u201chalf of a half-gallon of ice cream\u201d\u2014even though, normally, he follows a strict protocol that has helped him lose 47 pounds. A third man, who identifies himself as Alex Morozov, has trouble staying on topic. He congratulates Johnson on his work, and then, apropos of nothing, boasts that he recently went to a MAHA press conference and \u201ceven asked a question.\u201d But where, Johnson probes, is the debauchery in that? Morozov hedges, then discloses that he has made his apartment a \u201csugar-free zone,\u201d affixing stickers to this effect to many household surfaces. With further prompting, he admits he once had high triglycerides. \u201cWell, what led to the high triglycerides?\u201d Johnson asks. Morozov finally admits that his weakness is \u201call kinds of delicious cookies, bars, [and] chocolate.\u201d But even this is not enough for Johnson, who presses him to reveal the number of indulgences per day. \u201cFive, six, seven, eight,\u201d Morozov says. The room roars with laughter. \u201cYeah, well, we accept you. We love you. Good job. It\u2019s OK,\u201d Johnson tells him.\n\nThis public display of vulnerability acts as Johnson\u2019s segue into an extended sales pitch for Blueprint, a lifestyle brand he founded in 2021 after earning $800 million from the sale of his payment-processing company, Braintree Venmo, to PayPal. He reassures us that all humans are fragile and fallible, and at the mercy of what his website calls our \u201crascal self\u201d\u2014the part of our mind that tempts us to eat immoderately, drink to excess, and stay up until the wee hours. \u201cYou never want to put yourself in a situation where you have to make a decision,\u201d Johnson warns. \u201cYou want this decision to be made ahead of time. You want life habits and life systems that run automatically.\u201d When we\u2019re as tired as Dr. Mike was when he bought the Cheez-Its, Johnson believes, there\u2019s no chance our brains will keep us on the straight and narrow. The purpose of Blueprint is to remove the possibility of error by outsourcing all decision-making to a customized algorithm. A slide projected onto the auditorium\u2019s screens reads: NEVER LET YOUR MIND DECIDE.\n\nData is paramount for Blueprint, which relies on a tight feedback loop between meticulously tracked biometric measurements and the interventions they dictate. Johnson says one of his goals is to move the world of health and wellness \u201caway from storytelling,\u201d toward \u201cbiomarker and data measures.\u201d Only data will allow humanity to move beyond listening to our minds and bodies, transforming us into optimized meatbots. Dr. Mike agrees: A given diet or sleep regimen may leave you feeling great, but that\u2019s not what \u201ccounts,\u201d literally. \u201c \u2018I feel great.\u2019 But are you great?\u201d he asks rhetorically. \u201cLike, are you testing the things that matter?\u201d Our sensations are framed as untrustworthy manifestations of \u201cRascal Brain\u201d that only cramp our algorithmic style. It is the body\u2019s data, not its subjective impressions, that actually reflect our state of being.",

            "content": "Just consider how big of a week this is for Congress. Or more specifically, House Republicans.\n\n\u2013 Speaker Mike Johnson and the House GOP leadership are planning on putting their multi-trillion dollar budget resolution on the floor on Tuesday. That leaves less than one day in session for Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer to get their rank-and-file members in line before the high-stakes vote.\n\nIf this vote goes forward \u2013 and we\u2019re not entirely confident it\u2019ll take place on Tuesday \u2013 it\u2019ll be after 6 p.m., sources tell us. As always, the timing of any vote could easily shift. The other big issue here is attendance. Leadership on both sides is working to make sure everyone shows up.\n\n\u2013 It\u2019s getting into crunch time for funding the government. There are just 18 days until federal agencies \u2013 already under extraordinary pressure thanks to the DOGE initiative \u2013 run out of money. GOP and Democratic appropriators don\u2019t have a topline spending deal yet. As we\u2019ve told you repeatedly, Democrats are insisting on restrictions on President Donald Trump\u2019s authority to spend funds as Congress mandates. Republicans say they\u2019re not interested in limiting what Trump can do.\n\n\u2013 House Republicans are coming back into town after some lawmakers heard an earful about Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE effort. This was, in part, drummed up by Democratic allies looking to pressure House Republicans on Musk\u2019s slash-and-burn efforts. More on DOGE below.\n\nThe budget resolution. Just before the House left for the weeklong Presidents\u2019 Day recess, the House Budget Committee advanced a spending blueprint that would, in theory, allow passage of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda to get through Congress in one massive reconciliation package.\n\nJohnson and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) spent a lot of political capital convincing Trump to side with the House over the Senate, which is aiming for two reconciliation bills. The theory here being that if Trump wanted permanent extension of the 2017 tax cuts, he\u2019d need to have it passed in one package.\n\nTrump endorsed the House GOP plan, which doesn\u2019t allow the budgetary room to permanently extend the 2017 tax cuts plus enact the president\u2019s other priorities, including eliminating taxes on tips, Social Security and overtime and the SALT cap. Permanent extension of the 2017 cuts has a $4.7 trillion price tag. This resolution, at most, has $4 trillion in space for tax cuts.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about timing. Scheduling a Tuesday vote is, of course, a risk. Before the announcement, we assumed that House GOP leaders would want to take all week to whip members before bringing the resolution up for a vote.\n\nThe GOP leadership is trying to create some urgency for lawmakers to get on board quickly. This would give the House the upper hand in negotiations with Senate Republicans. A vote for the House GOP resolution is a vote to proceed with the president\u2019s \u201cfull agenda,\u201d they argue.\n\nRemember: Johnson can lose just one vote on the floor if all members are present. And plenty of House Republicans are scared about what it means to vote for $880 billion in cuts to programs under the House Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s purview, cuts that will almost certainly include Medicaid.\n\nHere\u2019s one no: Rep. Victoria Spartz (R-Ind.) said on X Sunday night that she\u2019s \u201ca no on the current version\u201d of the budget resolution.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) has said she\u2019s a \u201clean no.\u201d Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas), the chair of the Hispanic Conference who represents a large district on the U.S.-Mexico border, sent Johnson a letter raising concerns about cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and Pell Grants. That letter was co-signed by Malliotakis, Reps. Monica De La Cruz (R-Texas), David Valadao (R-Calif.), Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.) and Rob Bresnahan (R-Pa.). Gonzales and members of the GOP Hispanic Conference will meet with Johnson this evening.\n\nThen there are swing district members like Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who also told us he\u2019s concerned about Medicaid cuts.\n\nOf course, the resolution doesn\u2019t actually stipulate which cuts Republicans have to make. But Democrats are going to say Republicans are slashing Medicaid, food stamps and other social safety net programs.\n\nGovernment funding. Today is Feb. 24. On March 14, the federal government will run out of money. There\u2019s no top-line funding deal. The two sides claim they\u2019re not at an impasse, but the truth is that they are.\n\nJohnson needs Democrats to get a funding bill through the House. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune needs Democrats to get it through the Senate.\n\nBut if you look at the incentive structure right now, it is not in any way in Democrats\u2019 interest to help Republicans on anything. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday that \u201cRepublicans have the House, the Senate and the presidency. It is their responsibility to govern.\u201d\n\nDemocrats want new restrictions on how Trump and his administration spend government money. Republicans aren\u2019t going anywhere near this.\n\nBut some Republicans think the House can pass a clean CR through the end of the year. We\u2019ll see if they can.\n\nSpeaker office news. AJ Sugarman is joining Johnson\u2019s staff as deputy policy director. Sugarman was a policy adviser to Scalise and worked in Trump\u2019s first administration in legislative affairs and OMB. Johnson said he is \u201cexcited\u201d Sugarman is joining. He will handle the appropriations and budget portfolio.",

            "content": "The Columbus Blue Jackets are boosted by several prolific high-scoring talents.\n\nOne of those is winger Kent Johnson.\n\nIn parts of four NHL seasons, the 22-year-old is enjoying a career year as he's back and healthy following an injury-shortened season a year ago.\n\nNearly one calendar year ago, Johnson's turbulent 2023-24 campaign came to an early close after suffering a labrum tear in his left shoulder in the closing seconds of a 4-1 loss to the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden.\n\nJohnson's season got off to a bumpy start under one-and-done head coach Pascal Vincent as the forward was healthy scratched for their season opener. Then Johnson was sent down to the AHL in early November, where he scored 15 points (five goals, 10 assists) in 10 games before coming back to the NHL in early December.\n\nThe statistical numbers for Johnson were off. He didn't quite resemble the guy who scored 40 points (16 goals, 24 assists) a season prior and then the injury sealed his season.\n\nTurn The Page\n\nWhen the Jackets finally finished an ugly season and made wholesale changes from the front office to the coaching staff, including bringing in veteran head coach Dean Evason, the franchise turned the page and Johnson has as well.\n\nSince training camp, we've heard Evason compliment Johnson and his game in various ways, giving him perhaps the ultimate compliment of being a \"rink rat.\"\n\nI heard prior to coming here what a rink rat he was.\u2013 Dean Evason\n\n\"What we really liked about him this camp is the pace that he's playing the game at. He's got tremendous stick skills obviously. He's playing the game at a fast pace.\"\n\nThis season, Johnson has displayed the offensive fireworks.\n\nIn 43 games, he has 38 points (19 goals, 19 assists), having already set career highs in goals, and is going to blow by his career bests in assists and points. Johnson's 19 goals place him tied for second on the club with Dmitri Voronkov as they trail Kirill Marchenko (21).\n\nHe got off to a good start with Saturday's two-goal game in the 5-1 win over the Chicago Blackhawks, which gave him three goals in his last two games. He has 12 points (seven goals, five assists) in 10 of his last 11 games.\n\n#CBJ are up 1-0 after the opening period thanks to this Kent Johnson goal, his 18th of the season. Cole Sillinger gets the primary assist (his 19th), with Zach Werenski extending his home point streak to 22 games on the other assist, his 43rd.pic.twitter.com/Rrv1WLsmkG \u2014 1st Ohio Battery (@1stOhioBattery) February 23, 2025\n\nHere's KJ's second of the night (with anotheeeerrrrr assist from Z) that extended the #CBJ lead to 2-0.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other best DRIP stocks to own now.\n\nDividend investing is often regarded as a strategy that rewards patience, as it tends to generate stronger returns over the long term. Those who commit to holding their investments for extended periods are typically the ones who reap the greatest benefits. A major factor behind the success of this approach is the power of compounding. By reinvesting dividends\u2014using those payouts to purchase additional shares\u2014investors can enhance the growth of their portfolios. Rather than taking the dividends as cash, reinvesting them allows for a steady increase in share ownership, amplifying potential returns. Over time, this method has proven to be highly effective. In fact, a report from Hartford Funds highlights that since 1960, reinvested dividends and compounding have accounted for 69% of the broader market\u2019s total return.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Dividend Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nOver the years, analysts have closely monitored the impact of dividend reinvestment and have expressed favorable opinions about its benefits. Steven Greiner, Managing Director of Schwab Equity Ratings at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, supports this approach. He shares the following insight:\n\n\u201cReinvesting dividends is nearly effortless. Once you set it up\u2014which generally involves simply ticking a box\u2014there\u2019s nothing more to do but sit back and let compounding work its magic. Be aware, however, that companies can reduce or stop paying dividends.\u201d\n\nSteven Greiner\u2019s final point touches on a key concern for dividend investors\u2014the risk of a company suddenly cutting or suspending its dividend payments. No investor wants to be caught in that situation. While many tend to measure success primarily by stock price appreciation, a deeper analysis offers a broader perspective. A study of major global indexes over a 25-year period, ending in March 2018, found that reinvested dividends contributed nearly 3% in additional growth, as reported by Forbes. This underscores the vital role that dividends play in enhancing investment returns beyond just price gains. It serves as a strong reminder that evaluating an investment solely based on stock price movements may offer an incomplete picture. By incorporating dividend reinvestment into the assessment, investors gain a more comprehensive and accurate view of overall performance.\n\nA separate analysis from T. Rowe Price found that over the three decades leading up to 2022, reinvested dividends played a crucial role in market returns, contributing a notable 42.5% to overall gains. The report also emphasized that dividend reinvestment had an even greater impact on a select group of high-performing companies\u2014those that consistently increase their dividends at a rate exceeding the broader market. This effect becomes more powerful over time, as reinvesting a steadily growing dividend further accelerates long-term investment returns.\n\nFor long-term investors looking for steady returns, focusing on stocks with strong dividend growth can be a strategic approach. Reinvesting dividends from these stocks allows investors to gradually increase their holdings, leveraging the power of compounding to boost overall returns and steadily grow their wealth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile this list, we looked through Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds as of Q4 2024.

The true test, according to Reuters , will be the anticipated Feb. 25, 2025 ruling on the company's third attempt to settle through bankruptcy.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (J&J) is still at it \u2014 battling lawsuits alleging its talcum baby powder caused ovarian cancer. The company\u2019s latest $10 billion bankruptcy settlement proposal ($8 million in today's dollars) has reignited controversies surrounding claim validity, the use of subsidiary bankruptcies and the fairness of compensation. The true test, according to Reuters, will be the anticipated Feb. 25, 2025 ruling on the company's third attempt to settle through bankruptcy.\n\nHow This Chapter 11 Attempt Differs\n\nJ&J\u2019s third attempt to settle more than 62,000 lawsuits differs not only in its being held in a different court, but also because it leverages support from the plaintiffs, subsidiary Red River Talc reported in Reuters. \u201cWe have the vote,\u201d said Allison Brown, Red River Talc's attorney, asserting that the bankruptcy plan has \u201cenormous support\u201d based on claimant voting.\n\nHowever, objections remain strong. Critics, such as the opposing plaintiffs' attorney, Adam Silverstein, claim voting was manipulated, with \u201cno\u201d votes being challenged while some \u201cyes\u201d votes lacked proper documentation. A federal judge in Houston, Christopher Lopez, will decide whether this third plan differs sufficiently from J&J\u2019s past failures, previously rejected for lacking financial distress.\n\nThe company continues to assert that the settlement offers a faster and fairer compensation method than a lengthy trial process.\n\nGovernment Challenges the J&J Settlement\n\nJ&J\u2019s bankruptcy strategy faces opposition not just from plaintiffs, but also from U.S. agencies. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs argue the plan violates bankruptcy laws and impacts government reimbursement rights for care provided under Medicare and Medicaid, Fierce Pharma reported. Citing the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act, the agencies assert that the settlement undermines federal recovery statutes.\n\nDespite these objections, J&J's litigation chief Erik Haas defended the plan, calling it one of the \u201clargest settlements in mass tort bankruptcy history\u201d with the support of over 80% of claimants, per Fierce Pharma.\n\nHigh Stakes Decision Looms\n\nThe outcome of this case holds significant implications. Approval could resolve nearly all talc-related lawsuits and prevent future claims, Asbestos.com stated. Critics argue the lawsuits \u2014 linking talcum powder to cancer and asbestos contamination \u2014 merit jury trials and higher compensation. J&J continues to deny asbestos contamination in its products, pointing to its shift toward cornstarch-based baby powder in recent years.\n\nJudge Lopez will evaluate evidence, including challenges to the voting process and whether such a financially robust company should use bankruptcy protections. A decision is expected after hearings conclude in February, Reuters reported.",

            "content": "The bankruptcy hearing for Johnson & Johnson has started, and it may last a few weeks before a judge in Texas rules either in favor of the healthcare giant or with the victims of the company\u2019s harmful approach to business.\n\nAccording to numerous reports, including Reuters, the bankruptcy proposal of more than $8 billion to settle tens of thousands of cancer lawsuits hangs in the balance. The hearing to determine the validity of the bankruptcy plan, along with the opposition to it, began last week in Houston, Texas.\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez will preside over the hearing and decide on the Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan, which Johnson & Johnson is using to sidestep pending and future lawsuits. The company faces approximately 60,000 pending legal claims from people who developed cancer after using Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder.\n\nThe bankruptcy settlement applies to people, specifically women, with ovarian cancer who blame their cancer diagnosis on past use of Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder. Ovarian cancer makes up the majority of cancer cases connected to Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder.\n\nThe remaining small minority of cases are mesothelioma, which is a rare cancer that forms in the lining of the lungs, abdominal cavity and heart. This bankruptcy settlement proposal excludes mesothelioma cases.\n\nBackstory of Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder and Cancer Lawsuits\n\nJohnson & Johnson Baby Powder was made with the ingredient talc, which is a mineral capable of absorbing moisture and keeping skin healthy. Talc can be contaminated with asbestos, which is another mineral once prized for industrial use. Asbestos causes cancers like mesothelioma, lung cancer and ovarian cancer.\n\nThe presence of tiny asbestos particles in talcum powder used for Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder was overlooked or ignored for decades, which led to many consumers being exposed to asbestos and developing a deadly cancer.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has created a subsidiary company, Red River Talc, to shoulder the legal liabilities associated with the company\u2019s baby powder brand, which is no longer manufactured or sold. The subsidiary is filing for bankruptcy, which allows it to avoid facing lawsuits individually in the usual legal process and instead settles the claims in a bulk payment to victims.\n\nAdditionally, all future claims from victims will be paid from what\u2019s called an asbestos trust fund. These trust funds pay victims a much smaller compensation amount than what they would receive from an individual lawsuit settlement, or a lawsuit verdict.\n\nThis maneuver of creating a subsidiary to then file for bankruptcy is called the Texas Two-Step. It\u2019s a favorable tactic in Texas, which is why Johnson & Johnson filed the bankruptcy in the state after two previous attempts in other states were denied by judges.\n\nLooking Ahead to Johnson & Johnson Bankruptcy Hearing\n\nJohnson & Johnson representatives state the company has the necessary number of votes from plaintiffs in pending lawsuits to proceed with the bankruptcy plan. However, some attorneys opposing the plan believe the process was \u201crigged.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Reuters article, an attorney representing opposing plaintiffs said Johnson & Johnson challenged every vote of \u201cno\u201d for the bankruptcy while accepting votes in favor. Johnson & Johnson also allegedly allowed votes to change from \u201cno\u201d (opposing) to \u201cyes\u201d (in favor) yet ignored changing votes from \u201cyes\u201d to \u201cno.\u201d\n\nSome groups, including federal government agencies, heavily oppose the plan. For instance, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs spoke out against Johnson & Johnson\u2019s bankruptcy. The VA provides benefits to veterans with diseases such as mesothelioma and lung cancer.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the hearing will last until the end of February. The judge will consider the validity of the voting process and whether a wealth company like Johnson & Johnson should even be allowed to use a bankrupt subsidiary as a shield from lawsuits.\n\nFollow Mesothelioma Guide\u2019s website for updates on the Johnson & Johnson hearing.",

            "content": "With just under six minutes remaining in Sunday\u2019s contest, the Cavalier faithful in John Paul Jones Arena moved to the edge of their seats as the video board displayed that sophomore guard Kymora Johnson was just two points away from reaching 1,000 career points. Fans did not have to wait long to jump out of their seats, as just 30 seconds later, Johnson knived her way to the basket and laid it in to etch her name in the Virginia women\u2019s basketball history books.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I didn't even know that I was close to my 1,000th point,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI was like, whatever, we got a game to play.\u201d\n\nJohnson had 18 points through three quarters, and it appeared as if she would not hit the milestone Sunday. However, a sequence early in the fourth quarter changed things. Johnson hit a three-point shot, stole a Stanford pass and pulled up to hit another triple in 12 seconds to put her electric playstyle on full display. Suddenly, she had a shot at the monumental career mark.\n\nJohnson\u2019s 33 total points in the game were a season-high and just two points shy of her career best that she achieved during her freshman year. On top of the scoring, Johnson poured in 12 assists and eight rebounds \u2014 giving her an incredible stat line that has not been achieved in women\u2019s college basketball since 2018, which was done by Iowa superstar Caitlin Clark.\n\nJohnson was not the only Cavalier to put on a show, though, as the entire team looked cohesive and helped contribute to the dominant 89-69 win over Stanford.\n\n\u201cThis was probably our best game all season on both sides of the ball,\u201d Coach Amaka Agugua-Hamilton said. \u201cI think we were just locked in.\u201d\n\nJust four minutes into the first quarter, senior forward Latasha Lattimore drained a three-point shot to put Virginia up 13-1 \u2014 giving the Cavaliers (14-14, 6-10 ACC) a double digit lead that they would hold onto for the remainder of the contest. The Cardinal (14-13, 6-10 ACC) had no answer for the red hot Virginia offense, which connected on a season-high 14 three-point shots.\n\nJunior guard Paris Clark, who entered the game shooting just 17 percent from deep, hit two long balls as a part of her 18 points. Despite her woes this season, Clark shot the ball with confidence, making the Stanford defense pay for sagging off all game.\n\n\u201cI know I can shoot the ball,\u201d Clark said. \u201cI'm in the gym all the time, before practice, after practice, just with the coaches, just putting up extra shots and on my own.\u201d\n\nWhile Clark and Johnson tore up the Cardinal defense from the perimeter, senior forward Latasha Lattimore dominated the paint \u2014 putting up 21 points and 12 rebounds for her 10th double-double of the season.\n\nHer play down low, especially early in the game, forced Stanford to either play two-three zone or play man defense and crash the paint with their perimeter defenders. Both situations freed up Johnson and Clark for jumpshots, creating an unstoppable offense for Virginia. This performance from Lattimore follows up an uncharacteristically disappointing outing against California last Thursday.\n\n\u201cI was actually pretty disappointed in her performance in the Cal game, and it had nothing to do with points or anything like that, just competing and doing the things that she knows how to do,\u201d Coach Agugua-Hamilton said. \u201c[She was] just playing free, playing free, playing with energy and joy and all that \u2026 she really responded.\u201d\n\nPlaying free was the story of Sunday\u2019s contest, as the entire Virginia team could be smiling, dancing, and celebrating either on the court or bench throughout the whole game. If the Cavaliers are able to play as loose as they were able to Sunday, they could be a tough out and potentially even bust some brackets in the ACC tournament.\n\nThis level of intention from the Cavaliers is essential if they hope to make a postseason run. Virginia looks to carry this momentum on the road into their final two regular season games. The first leg of the road trip is against Southern Methodist, Thursday at 8 p.m., when Johnson will lead her squad into Texas with tons of momentum.\n\nHowever, if there were any issues shown during the victory, it was the bench \u2014 as the starters totaled for 87 of Virginia\u2019s 89 points. The three-headed monster of Johnson, Clark and Lattimore have proven it can carry a heavy workload, but extra help is needed against stiffer competition.\n\nEven so, the video-game numbers from the Cavaliers were freshing \u2014 and the team keeps their focus on winning.\n\n\u201cWe've been talking a lot about playing to win and not playing not to lose,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI think that playing to win means you got to take every possession the same and it matters.\u201d\n\nIt seems, for now, that Virginia has gotten back on track. When these Cavaliers are at their best, anything can happen.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 11 Best Performing Dow Stocks So Far in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other best performing Dow stocks so far in 2025.\n\nThe Dow is a renowned and significant stock market index that measures the performance of 30 publicly traded businesses listed on US stock exchanges, representing a diverse variety of industries.\n\nAs of 20 February 2025, the index has steadily increased, rising 14.41% in the last 12 months and 4.21% year to date in 2025. It rose 8.04% over the last six months, mirroring its 8.04% gain in the previous month. Over the long term, it has risen 52.37% in the last five years and has returned an astounding 3,362.55% since 1985.\n\nIn comparison, the broader market has outpaced the Dow, gaining 22% in the last year and 4% year to date in 2025. The wider market has risen 8.84% during the last six months, with a 1.13% increase in the last month. Its long-term performance has been favorable, with a five-year gain of 83.28% and a remarkable 3,717.09% increase since 1996. Its superior performance is largely due to the strength of technology and high-growth stocks.\n\nNonetheless, the Nasdaq has led the market, climbing 28.12% in the last 12 months and 3.53% year to date in 2025. Over the last six months, the Nasdaq has gone up by 11.40%, with 1.04% growth in the last month. Over the last five years, it has surged by 108.45%, proving its dominance in high-growth sectors.\n\nWhile the Dow has fallen behind the other two markets in recent years, its consistency and solid historical returns underline its long-term investment appeal. The index typically has reduced volatility and concentrates on established blue-chip companies.\n\nAccording to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dow is still a dependable benchmark for US market performance, following 30 blue-chip businesses with strong reputations and consistent growth. Its price-weighted system ensures stability, typically reducing losses during downturns. The index has a historical association with broader markets, but it is less volatile than the broader market due to its emphasis on well-established firms. Despite its small size, the index has shown resilience in bear markets, such as 2009, while also reaping gains during bullish cycles. Its longstanding reputation and exposure to important industries make it a reliable predictor of economic strength.\n\nHowever, the Dow lost 0.6% on Thursday, February 20, 2025, as U.S. jobless claims surged faster than expected, heightening concerns about the labor market and the overall economic outlook. The wider market fell 0.5%, while the Nasdaq fell 0.7% in early trading, signaling broader market weakness. Investors reacted to economic data and shifting market sentiment as bond yields edged lower, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 4.52%.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe began with a pool of 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and identified stocks that have delivered positive returns in 2025 so far. We then picked the top 11 stocks with the highest Year-to-Date return as of February 14. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their year-to-date performance.\n\n\u201cWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\u201d\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nYear-to-date return as of February 14: 8.42%\n\nOne of the Best Performing Stocks, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the biggest and most varied healthcare company in the world. Medical gadgets and pharmaceuticals make up its two divisions. After Kenvue, the company\u2019s consumer division, was sold off in 2023, these currently account for all of the company\u2019s sales. The therapeutic areas that the drug division focuses on are immunology, neurology, cardiology, cancer, pulmonary, and metabolic diseases. Geographically, the United States accounts for slightly more than half of overall revenue.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the exclusive leader in all of the main healthcare sectors. It sustains a broad economic moat through outstanding cash flow generation, a growing research pipeline, and multiple revenue sources.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) declared on January 13 that it will pay $14.6 billion to purchase Intra-Cellular, a biopharmaceutical business that specializes in the development and marketing of treatments for disorders of the central nervous system, along with its medication Caplyta, which treats depression and schizophrenia.\n\nOn February 3, Guggenheim analyst Vamil Divan boosted Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\u2019s price target to $166 from $162 and maintained a Neutral rating on the stock after upgrading the firm\u2019s company model following Q4 results that mostly matched or slightly exceeded analyst and investor expectations. To determine whether J&J can maintain its mid-single-digit growth goals while it waits to see how it handles its near-term challenges and completes its Innovative Medicine pipeline, the company says it will be keeping an eye on pipeline readouts and execution in the fields of oncology, immunology, and neuroscience.\n\nOverall, JNJ ranks 9th on our list of Best Performing Dow Stocks So Far in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential for JNJ to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The square pizzas in Detroit are cool, but sometimes too thick.\u201d\n\nJohnson then gets handed a pizza box with one slice and presents it to Jackson, who says \u201cI\u2019m on a diet,\u201d causing both to crack up. Johnson then says \u201cIf it was Detroit pizza, you\u2019d eat it! Right here!\u201d Jackson responds \u201cIf it was Detroit pizza, it would be like 12,000 squares.\u201d They then have a bit of an exchange with Johnson saying \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to eat that, hold that for me,\u201d and Jackson saying \u201cPeople don\u2019t know how greedy you are. Seriously, bro, like everything, not chose, remember that, not chose.\u201d\n\nAn amusing part of this is that despite this question coming from the Illinois coach, there was almost no discussion of Chicago-style pizza here, with Johnson and Jackson instead advocating for Detroit and New York-style. (And that\u2019s about how this game went for the unranked Illini, who experienced the most lopsided loss in program history, falling 110-67 to the No. 3 Blue Devils.)\n\nBut it was also funny to see the back-and-forth between Johnson and Jackson, who have worked together for more than a decade across BTN and Fox\u2019s networks and clearly have some fun poking each other. And in a basketball game this lopsided (it was 85-51 Duke early in the second half when this discussion came up), the pizza debate was a good fit, similar to some great moments we\u2019ve seen in baseball and football blowouts.\n\nThe pizza discussion here made a bit of sense as a way to emphasize this game being in New York, too. But the interplay between the announcers made it much funnier than it might have been otherwise.",

The statement \"Geaux Time\" leads the story about how all three made their way to Baton Rouge.\n\nThe cover, dropped ahead of LSU's final three SEC regular season games, highlights \"that southern flair\" displayed by the trio as they look to lead the Tigers to the second national championship of the head coach Kim Mulkey era.\n\nThe story opens with Williams and Johnson on a visit to campus and admiring the landscape inside the PMAC. Both decided they would take their talents to LSU and committed in the summer of 2022. Johnson won SEC Freshman of the Year and started on the national title team in the 2022-23 season.\n\n\"Anything less than a Final Four, I'm not gonna be happy about because I know what this team is capable of,\" Johnson said of the 2024-25 team. \"Once you get a taste of that national championship, that's the standard we have here now. We're not going for anything less at all.\"\n\nWilliams and Morrow both arrived to Baton Rouge in time for the 2023-24 season. Morrow who transferred from DePaul, brought \"experience and veteran leadership\" to a group of young stars.\n\nAfter leading the nation in rebounds and double-doubles, Morrow cemented herself as a future first round pick in the WNBA. The star forward prioritizes her teammates' unique qualities and helping them shine.\n\n\"I just wanted to make sure that all my teammates felt open, that they all had a voice [and] they could speak up on things whenever they wanted to,\" Morrow said.\n\nThe story goes on to detail Williams' rise to stardom as a mix between a perimeter and paint presence. A native of Bossier City, LA, Williams elaborated on what it means to represent her home state school.\n\n\"I want to show all the little girls coming behind me that it's possible to be from Louisiana, stay at home and do something big,\" Williams said. \"I want them to see that with hard work and sacrifice, they can make it to the biggest stage of their lives.\"",

            "content": "Most readers would already be aware that Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) stock increased significantly by 11% over the past month. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Johnson & Johnson's ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Johnson & Johnson\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Johnson & Johnson is:\n\n20% = US$14b \u00f7 US$71b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.20 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nJohnson & Johnson's Earnings Growth And 20% ROE\n\nTo start with, Johnson & Johnson's ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 19%. For this reason, Johnson & Johnson's five year net income decline of 3.0% raises the question as to why the decent ROE didn't translate into growth. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.\n\nHowever, when we compared Johnson & Johnson's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 1.8% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.",

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh/AP)\n\nThe NFL Scouting Combine begins Tuesday in Indianapolis. Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Poles and first-year head coach Ben Johnson are both expected to meet with members of the media during the combine.\n\nThis is a crucial week for their draft preparation. Poles and Johnson will have a chance to meet with many of the 329 prospects who the NFL invited to the event.\n\nWhat exactly can they accomplish at the combine? Here are three things they can do this week.\n\n1. Set offseason expectations\n\nRyan Poles Bears general manager Ryan Poles, right, listens to reporters during a news conference Jan. 7 at Halas Hall in Lake Forest. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh/AP)\n\nThis will mark the first time either Poles or Johnson has spoken with the media since Johnson\u2019s opening news conference on Jan. 22.\n\nNot a single head coach or GM across the league is going to telegraph his team\u2019s offseason intentions at such an early stage. Still, these media sessions will set the stage for what\u2019s to come during free agency in March and the draft in April.\n\nThe Bears are in a favorable spot. The NFL just revised the salary cap number for 2025. Teams will be allowed to spend at least $277.5 million on player salaries (potentially as high as $281.5 million). With a projected $69 million in available cap space to play with, per OverTheCap.com, the Bears have the sixth-most money to spend among 32 teams.\n\nThe Bears also hold three draft selections among the top 41 picks (the 10th, 39th and 41st picks), and eight draft selections overall.\n\nWith that much cap flexibility and several premium draft picks, the Bears can approach this offseason in any number of ways.\n\n2. Begin rebuilding the offensive line\n\nColeman Shelton, Caleb Williams, Darnell Wright, Matt Pryor Bears center Coleman Shelton (65) waits to snap the ball to quarterback Caleb Williams (18) as right tackle Darnell Wright (58) and right guard Matt Pryor (79) line up against the Los Angeles Rams on Sept. 29 in Chicago. (AP Photo/Kamil Krzaczynski/AP)\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the one position group that needs the most work on the Bears' roster in 2025 is the offensive line. It\u2019s possible only one or two starters from 2024 will return in 2025.\n\nIf Johnson and Poles want it to be, the O-line could essentially be a blank slate.\n\nNobody would be surprised, then, if the Bears spend a lot of their interview time next week meeting with some of the draft\u2019s top offensive line prospects. With the No. 10 overall pick, the team is in position to grab one of the draft\u2019s best offensive linemen, if Poles and Johnson decide to go that direction.\n\nKey prospect names to watch include LSU tackle Will Campbell, Ohio State tackle Josh Simmons, Texas tackle Kelvin Banks Jr., Alabama guard Tyler Booker and versatile Missouri lineman Armand Membou, to name a few.\n\nWhat they ultimately decide to do in the draft, though, will have to work in tandem with what they do in free agency first.\n\nThe negotiating window for free agency opens March 10 and teams can officially begin signing players on March 12.\n\n3. Don\u2019t forget about the other line\n\nBears defensive tackle Gervon Dexter Sr. celebrates after sacking Tennessee Titans quarterback Will Levis on Sept. 8 at Soldier Field in Chicago. (Mark Busch)\n\nEverything about the coming years will be about maximizing quarterback Caleb Williams' potential. That\u2019s why rebuilding the offensive line is so important.\n\nBut a thriving defense will be any quarterback\u2019s best friend. This offseason could \u2013 and maybe should \u2013 focus on the trenches. Certainly, the biggest contracts and the highest draft picks feel destined for the offensive and defensive lines.\n\nThe Bears' defensive line in 2024 was too top-heavy. When defensive end Montez Sweat and defensive tackles Gervon Dexter and Andrew Billings were all healthy and playing together early in the season, that group looked formidable.\n\nBut when Billings went down with a season-ending injury midway through the year, it exposed the lack of depth behind those three front-line starters.\n\nIf the offensive line is priority No. 1, the defensive line certainly looks like priority No. 2. The Bears need to find a consistent pass rushing threat to play opposite Sweat, who struggled down the stretch in 2024.\n\nIn three drafts in charge of the Bears, Poles hasn\u2019t taken a big swing on an edge rusher. The highest the Bears have selected an edge rusher under Poles is the fifth round. That could change this year if the Bears target one with any of those three picks in the top 41.",

That led to much criticism about the Bears selection of Williams, but now with Johnson, one of the best offensive minds in football, leading the way as head coach, the young quarterback could be taken to the next level.\n\nQuarterback guru and NFL veteran Jordan Palmer is someone who knows the position and the game very well. This week, Palmer was a guest on The Rich Eisen Show and was asked about the Johnson and Williams pairing, and he's extremely optimistic. Not only is Palmer a fan of the two working together, but he believes Williams will become a superstar in the NFL.\n\n\"Caleb's gonna be a superstar. However you wanna chalk up his rookie year, on his standard, this is the first failure year,\" Palmer said of the quarterback he's known since high school. \"You look at the stats and I don't think it was as nearly bad as everybody thought. This was the first year it didn't go awesome for him since he was a kid. Some times when guys have a bad rookie year, high picks, I worry about them...I don't have that with Caleb.\"\n\nAfter seeing the work that Johnson did in Detroit, and the resurrection of Jared Goff's career, Palmer believes the Williams' talent makes it that much more intriguing for the duo.\n\n\"We haven't seen a Ben Johnson offense with a quarterback that is mobile,\" Palmer said. \"I'm going to be fascinated to study what Ben Johnson is going to do. In terms of the marriage between those two, I'm going to be fascinated to watch how good the Chicago Bears can get and how quickly.\"\n\nJohnson has arrived in Chicago to bring back winning football and develop Williams, and there's no other narratives of importance going into next season. If Johnson and Williams can achieve those goals together, they will be a duo well worth watching for years to come with the Bears.",

            "content": "Flau'jae Johnson conceded last year that she and Angel Reese have drifted apart since going their separate ways after sharing the court together at LSU.\n\nThe dynamic duo of Johnson and Reese was a force to be reckoned with under head coach Kim Mulkey, leading the Tigers to an NCAA championship victory against Caitlin Clark's Iowa in 2023 and reaching the Elite Eight the following year.\n\nOn the heels of their decorated time together at LSU, however, the once inseparable pair seems to have lost the close bond they shared - both on the basketball court and off. Johnson is averaging nearly 20 points per game while shooting just under 50% from the field in her junior year with the Tigers, while Reese is dominating at the professional level for Unrivaled's Rose BC and the WNBA's Chicago Sky.\n\nIn a conversation with the New York Post last September, Johnson admitted: \u201cYeah, me and Angel, we aren\u2019t as close as we used to be. But I still support her 1,000 percent. I was proud of her, just being in the W[NBA] and breaking records.\n\n\u201cA lot of people said that she wouldn\u2019t go to the W[NBA] and do all those things and they kinda hated on her. But I kinda knew that because I\u2019d see it everyday in practice and I see the mentality that she has. So, it\u2019s been dope [to watch her].\u201d\n\nWhile opening up about her connection with Johnson during the 'Unapologetically Angel' podcast, Reese mirrored these thoughts. \u201cI still support Flau\u2019jae. We aren\u2019t as close as we used to be,\u201d lamented the star forward.\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s no hard feelings or anything, but we aren\u2019t as close as we used to be. That\u2019s why people always expect us to still posting each other but we aren\u2019t as close. It happens. You don\u2019t have the best relationships with everybody and don\u2019t always continue relationships with people. So, I wish her the best always. I\u2019m always going to support her.\u201d\n\nThe recent admissions from Reese and Johnson come rather unexpectedly, given their previously tight-knit bond evident as recently as April of 2024. Following LSU's Elite Eight defeat to Iowa, the guard and rapper fiercely defended her teammate from negative criticism during an impassioned news conference.\n\n\"Everybody can have their opinion on Angel Reese, but y'all don't know her,\" Johnson told reporters during a fiery postgame press conference. \"Y'all don't know Angel Reese. I know Angel Reese. I know the real Angel Reese and the person I see every day is a strong person, is a caring, loving person.\"\n\n\"The crown she wears is heavy. She's the type of teammate that's going to make you believe in yourself. The leap that I took from my freshman to my sophomore year, Angel gave me that confidence to go be a dog.\"",

Higher sales of key products such as Darzalex, Tremfya, Uptravi, and Erleada drove the segment\u2019s growth. New drugs like Carvykti, Tecvayli and Spravato also contributed to growth. Xarelto and Simponi/Simponi Aria sales also improved in the quarter. The sales growth was partially dampened by lower sales of Stelara, Imbruvica and generic/biosimilar competition to drugs like Zytiga and Remicade.\n\nJ&J\u2019s fourth-quarter 2024 earnings came in at $2.04 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.00. Earnings declined 10.9% from the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings exclude intangible amortization expense and special items, including which, reported earnings were $1.41 per share, down 17.1% year over year. Both adjusted and reported earnings included a 22 cents acquired IPR&D charge related to the V-Wave acquisition. Sales came in at $22.52 billion, which marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.51 billion. Sales rose 5.3% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 6.7% and a negative currency impact of 1.4%. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and currency, sales rose 5.7% on an operational basis. The Stelara loss of exclusivity (\u201cLOE\u201d) hurt revenue growth by 290 basis points in the quarter. Fourth-quarter sales in the domestic market rose 10% to $13.2 billion. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures on an adjusted operational basis, domestic sales rose 8.6% in the quarter. International sales declined 0.7% on a reported basis to $9.32 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 2.5% and a negative currency impact of 3.2%. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures on an adjusted operational basis, international sales rose 2.0% in the quarter.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Johnson & Johnson due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nStelara LOE negatively impacted growth by 490 basis points.\n\n\n\nIn the Innovative Medicines segment, sales in the United States rose 11.4%, while outside U.S. sales declined 1% on an operational basis.\n\n\n\nDarzalex sales rose 20.9% year over year to $3.08 billion in the quarter, driven by continued share gains across all lines of therapy, particularly the front-line setting, as well as market growth. Sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 billion and our model estimate of $3.06 billion.\n\n\n\nStelara declined 14.7% to $2.35 billion in the quarter due to the impact of current and potential biosimilar competition. While U.S. sales of Stelara declined 4.9%, international sales declined 32.7% in the quarter. However, Stelara sales slightly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.34 billion as well as our model estimate of $2.21 billion.\n\n\n\nA biosimilar version of Stelara was launched in certain European markets for certain indications in July 2024.\n\n\n\nSeveral biosimilar versions of Stelara are expected to be launched in the United States in 2025. Amgen launched the first Stelara biosimilar, Wezlana, in January 2025.\n\n\n\nImbruvica sales declined 7.2% to $731.0 million due to rising competitive pressure in the United States due to new oral competition. However, Imbruvica sales were better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $729.0 million and our estimate of $710.1.\n\n\n\nErleada generated sales of $784.0 million in the quarter, up 20.9% year over year, driven by share gains and market growth. Erleada sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $805.0 million as well as our model estimate of $793.8 million.\n\n\n\nTremfya recorded sales of $949.0 million in the quarter, up 4.2% year over year, driven by strong market growth. Share gains were partially offset by an unfavorable patient mix and inventory issues. Tremfya sales also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 billion as well as our model estimate of $1.09 billion.\n\n\n\nNew drug Carvykti recorded sales of $334 million compared with $286 million in the previous quarter, driven by share gains and continued capacity expansion. Another new drug, Tecvayli, recorded sales of $146 million in the quarter, up 15.8% year over year, driven by demand growth despite continued adoption of recently approved longer-duration dosing intervals.\n\n\n\nSpravato recorded sales of $297.0 million, up 44.6% year over year, driven by the ongoing launch and increased physician and patient demand.\n\n\n\nPAH drug Uptravi recorded sales of $465.0 million, up 11.2% year over year, driven by market growth, patient mix and share gains. Another PAH drug, Opsumit, recorded sales of $545 million, up 1.7% year over year.\n\n\n\nXarelto sales rose 28.5% in the quarter to $676.0 million due to favorable patient mix. Invega Sustenna/Xeplion/Invega Trinza/Trevicta sales rose 5.1% to $1.06 billion in the quarter. Simponi/Simponi Aria sales rose 16.2% to $583.0 million, while Prezista sales declined 7.4% to $407.0 million.\n\n\n\nZytiga sales declined 32.4% to $135.0 million in the quarter due to generic competition. Sales of Remicade were down 16.5% in the quarter to $359.0 million.\n\n\n\nDistribution rights for Remicade and Simponi in Europe were returned in the fourth quarter, which benefited their sales in the quarter.\n\n\n\nJ&J will begin disclosing separate sales of Talvey, Opsynvi and Rybrevant from the first quarter of 2025.\n\nMedTech Segment\n\nMedTech segment sales came in at $8.19 billion, up 6.7% from the year-ago period, as an operational increase of 7.6% was offset by a negative currency movement of 0.9%. MedTech segment sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.25 billion as well as our model estimate of $8.23 billion.\n\n\n\nExcluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, and currency, on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales rose 4.6%.\n\n\n\nIn the MedTech segment, sales rose 7.6% in the United States as well as outside of the United States on an operational basis.\n\n\n\nSales in the MedTech business were driven by new product uptake and commercial execution, which were partially offset by continued headwinds in Asia Pacific, specifically in China and increased competitive pressure in U.S. electrophysiology for PFA ablation catheter. Sales in China were hurt by the impact of the volume-based procurement (VBP) program. VBP is a government-driven cost containment effort in China.\n\n\n\nCardiovascular (previously Interventional Solutions) sales grew 23.6%, driven by the growth of electrophysiology products and higher sales of Abiomed. The acquisition of Shockwave contributed $228 million to Cardiovascular sales in the fourth quarter. Worldwide Surgery declined 0.9% due to competitive pressure in energy and endocutters, VBP issues in China and Acclarent divestiture, partially offset by the strength of new products and continued price increases. Worldwide orthopedics rose 2.1%, driven by growth in new products and commercial execution, partially offset by VBP issues in China, competitive pressure and revenue disruption from the previously announced Orthopedics transformation. Worldwide Vision rose 7.9% as a decent performance in Contact Lenses due to commercial execution was partially offset by competitive pressure in the U.S market in Surgical Vision.\n\n2024 Results\n\nFull-year 2024 sales rose 4.3% to $88.82 billion, marginally missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $88.84 billion. Sales were slightly ahead of the guidance range of $88.4 billion-$88.8 billion.\n\n\n\nAdjusted earnings for 2024 were $9.98 per share, up 0.6% year over year. Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.95 per share. Earnings matched the higher end of the guidance range of $9.88-$9.98 per share.\n\n2025 Guidance\n\nIn 2025, the company expects sales in the range of $89.2 billion-$90.0 billion. The sales range indicates growth in the range of 0.5%-1.5%. Operational sales growth is expected in the range of 2.5%-3.5%.\n\n\n\nThe adjusted operational sales (excluding currency impact, acquisitions/divestitures) growth is expected in the range of 2.0%-3.0%.\n\n\n\nThe revenue figures exclude revenues from COVID-19 vaccine sales.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, J&J expects growth in the Innovative Medicine segment despite the loss of exclusivity Stelara, approximately $2 billion negative impact of the Part D redesign and heavier impact from Fx. The growth is expected to be driven by its key products, such as Darzalex, Tremfya, Spravato and Erleada as well as new drugs like Carvykti, Tecvayli and Talvey and new indications, including Tremfya in IBD and Rybrevant in non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n\n\nIn the MedTech segment, recent acquisitions of Shockwave and Abiomed, as well as continued uptake of its new products, are likely to drive growth. However, China will continue to remain a headwind in 2025. The MedTech segment faces difficult year-over-year comparisons in the first quarter. Sales are expected to be higher in the second half than the first half as the business moves past tougher first-quarter comps and new products gain momentum throughout 2025.\n\n\n\nJ&J expects operational sales growth in both the Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments to be higher in the second half than the first.\n\n\n\nAdjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $10.50-$10.70. The earnings range implies growth in the range of 5.2% to 7.2%.\n\n\n\nOn an operational, constant-currency basis, adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase in the range of 7.7% to 9.7%.\n\n\n\nJ&J expects higher earnings per share growth in the second half of the year versus the first half.\n\n\n\nThe sales and earnings guidance excludes the impact of the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies. The pending acquisition of ITCI is expected to have a dilutive impact on adjusted EPS of approximately 30 cents to 35 cents per share in 2025.\n\n\n\nJ&J expects a negative currency impact of around $1.7 billion or 2.0% on sales and around 25 cents on earnings.\n\n\n\nAdjusted pretax operating margin is expected to improve by approximately 300 basis points to be driven by cost savings and reduced acquired IPR&D costs.\n\n\n\nOther income is expected to be in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion.\n\n\n\nNet interest income is expected to be between $0 million and $100 million due to higher interest expenses as J&J plans to fund the ITCI deal mainly with debt.\n\n\n\nThe adjusted tax rate guidance was maintained in the range of 16.5%-17.0%.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Johnson & Johnson has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Johnson & Johnson has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Credit: Shutterstock / BlurryMe.\n\nJohnson and Johnson\u2019s (J&J) fully subcutaneous Tremfya (guselkumab) has shown a second round of success in ulcerative colitis (UC), with 27.6% of patients achieving clinical remission in a Phase III trial.\n\nThe randomised double-blind Phase III Astro trial (NCT05528510) study examined a subcutaneous injectable version of J&J\u2019s blockbuster Tremfya for both induction and maintenance dosing in 418 adults with moderately to severely active UC, a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and an inadequate response to conventional therapies.\n\nInitial 12-week results found patients in the treatment arm seeing a clinical remission rate of 27.6% versus 6.5% for those in the placebo arm. At the same time, 65% of patients saw clinical response to the monoclonal antibody treatment, against 34% in the placebo arm. Additionally, 37.3% saw endoscopic improvement.\n\nEsi Lamous\u00e9-Smith, gastroenterology disease area lead at J&J, said: \u201cWe aim to offer treatment options for patients with IBD that allow them to effectively manage their disease while also meeting the daily demands of life. These results further underscore the potential of Tremfya to transform the UC treatment paradigm.\n\n\u201cPending approval, Tremfya would be the first IL-23 inhibitor with a fully subcutaneous induction and maintenance regimen, increasing options for both patients and healthcare providers.\u201d\n\nTremfya is a fully human antibody created to neutralise inflammation by blocking IL-23, a cytokine that plays a part in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. It is currently approved in the US for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and UC. Currently, the company is seeking approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for both UC and Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nThe announcement prompted a small jump in the company\u2019s stock price, going from $157 per share to $159 per share at the time of publication. Research by GlobalData estimates that Tremfya brought in $3.8bn in 2024, with that figure expected to climb to $9.7bn by the end of 2030. Within the same time frame, the overall market for UC therapies is expected to rise from $7.1bn, up to $16bn.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.\n\nIn terms of competition, there are currently only two other IL-23 inhibitors approved in the US besides Tremfya \u2013 Eli Lilly\u2019s Omvoh (mirikizumab) and AbbVie\u2019s Skyrizi (risankizumab). Both drugs brought in $132m and $11bn respectively, however, both currently rely on an initial intravenous infusion.\n\nJ&J\u2019s competition does have the edge in certain IBD indications, however, with both Omvoh and Skyrizi having been granted approval for Crohn\u2019s disease while Tremfya lacks the indication on its label. The Phase III GALAXI 2 & 3 studies however showed Tremfya to be efficacious in treating Crohn\u2019s.\n\nThe Astro trial follows alongside the company\u2019s Phase IIb/III Quasar study (NCT04033445), a dose-ranging induction study examining the therapy through intravenous infusion.\n\nLaurent Peyrin-Biroulet, head of the IBD unit at Nancy University Hospital and study investigator, said: \u201cThe week 12 results from the Astro study build on data from the Quasar study demonstrating that both Tremfya subcutaneous and intravenous induction achieved clinically differentiated results in patients with moderately to severely active UC. The flexibility of a fully subcutaneous treatment regimen would be a welcome option for many patients, especially those with busy and active lifestyles.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the field of UC therapies, Palisade Bio has begun the multiple-ascending dose (MAD) cohorts of its ongoing Phase Ia/Ib trial of PALI-2108. Meanwhile, Cristcot has announced results from its Phase III trial examining its hydrocortisone suppository and applicator.",

It was a bloody battle, the kind of terrain Scorsese covered in both Goodfellas and The Departed. In 1960s and 70s Hawaii, this formidable and charismatic mob boss rises to build the islands\u2019 most powerful criminal empire, waging a brutal war against mainland corporations and rival syndicates while fighting to preserve his ancestral land. It\u2019s based on the untold true story of a man who fought to preserve his homeland through a ruthless quest for absolute power \u2014 igniting the last great American mob saga, where the war for cultural survival takes place in the unlikeliest of places: paradise.\n\nProducers include Scorsese, Johnson, Blunt, DiCaprio, Bilton, Dany Garcia, Lisa Frechette and Rick Yorn.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThis would mean another big collaboration in an historic run for DiCaprio and Scorsese, who just recently worked together on Best Picture nominee Killers of Flower Moon, to go with highlights including The Aviator, The Departed, Gangs of New York, and The Wolf of Wall Street, This also marks a reunion for Blunt and Johnson, who worked together on Jungle Cruise for Disney. It is an especially big opportunity for Johnson, who has roots in Hawaii and long wanted to make a movie there. He has kicked around a movie about King Kamehameha, who in a much different way used his strength and persuasiveness to unite the islands to improve the dealing with the explorers that were finding their way to the island shores.\n\nJohnson is paired with Blunt on the Benny Safdi-directed Smashing Machine for A24, coming later this year. It was Blunt and Johnson who brought the idea to Scorsese and DiCaprio, and they all enlisted Bilton, who\u2019ll start writing when this gets set up.\n\nEven though these principals are engaged in other projects, the town quickly sparked to the pitch, and we hear multiple bids are either on the table or are fast mobilizing. This is poised to be a big one. Stay tuned.",

I\u2019ve also led a global supplier sustainability initiative, and I\u2019m currently serving as the global strategy lead for our analytics and data science initiative.\n\nWhat\u2019s a lesson from Yale SOM that has helped you on your career path since graduation?\n\nThe leadership classes, combined with the MAM capstone project, provided me with valuable exposure and insights, as well as practical experience collaborating with global teams across diverse cultures. This foundational training prepared me for the global role I currently hold.\n\nHave there been unexpected benefits from your SOM education?\n\nI was surprised by the exceptional support provided by the Career Development Office, which helped me navigate the job market and land my first position. The level of support from the SOM community overall\u2014students, faculty, and staff\u2014was also remarkable. This nurturing culture can be traced back to the Yale president during my time at SOM, Peter Salovey, who ensured that cost would not be a barrier for any Yale student. As an international student who received partial scholarships, I greatly benefited from this commitment.\n\nLastly, having the Yale brand on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has proven to be a significant asset in my career.\n\nWhat are you passionate about in your work?\n\nI\u2019m passionate about two aspects of my work. First is the commitment we have to putting patients, doctors, and nurses at the center of our efforts. There\u2019s a profound sense of urgency and importance in what we do for patient care. Second, my role in procurement involves managing relationships with key suppliers and designing strategies regarding what we buy, from whom, and at what price. For me, this is not a zero-sum game. It\u2019s essential that we allow our partners to achieve a fair profit. I focus on cultivating mutually beneficial relationships that promote growth for my company and our suppliers. I find it particularly rewarding to navigate these negotiations as someone who understands both sides.",

Feel free to contact Angela Gabriel at angela.gabriel@biospace.com.\n\nGRO Biosciences\n\nMarch 14\n\nGRO Biosciences began exploring strategic alternatives about six months after raising a Series B funding round and recently cut an undisclosed number of employees, including research staff, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nThe Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based synthetic biology company founded in 2016 also no longer lists two key executives on its leadership page, Fierce noted: Daniel Mandell, the founding CEO, and Christopher Gregg, the chief scientific officer.\n\nBorn out of genetics professor George Church\u2019s lab at Harvard University, GRO Biosciences closed its Series B round in July 2024, raising $60.3 million to help advance its pipeline and further develop its platform. The company planned to use the money mostly to start a Phase I clinical trial for its lead program ProGly-Uricase, an investigational enzyme-based therapy that had been proposed for severe and refractory gout. GRO is now exploring strategic alternatives to advance that program, Fierce reported.\n\nAtea Pharmaceuticals\n\nMarch 7\n\nAtea Pharmaceuticals let go about 25% of its workforce this quarter, a cost-cutting move that\u2019s expected to save roughly $15 million through 2027, the company announced March 6. The Boston-based clinical-stage biotech had 56 employees, including 39 in research and development, on March 4 according to an SEC filing on that date, suggesting that\u2019s how many employees will remain post-layoffs.\n\nWith its leaner staff, Atea is preparing for a Phase III trial of nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor bemnifosbuvir and NS5A inhibitor ruzasvir for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patient enrollment is expected to start in April. In a March 7 investor\u2019s note, William Blair analysts said they have an optimistic view on the trial\u2019s outcome, noting that midstage HCV trials have historically translated well to late-stage pivotal studies, specifically the sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment endpoint.\n\nAtea had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $454.7 million on Dec. 31, 2024, compared to $578.1 million on Dec. 31, 2023, according to its announcement. The company reported an accumulated deficit of $364.2 million as of Dec. 31, 2024, in its March 4 SEC filing but noted it expects to fund activities into 2028.\n\nALX Oncology\n\nMarch 6\n\nALX Oncology is letting go of 30% of its workers as part of \u201ca strategic prioritization and resource optimization exercise,\u201d the South San Francisco\u2013based company announced Wednesday. As of September 30, 2024, ALX had 89 employees, according to an SEC filing.\n\nMost of the laid-off employees worked on preclinical research, according to ALX, and the company will now prioritize continued development of the CD47-blocker evorpacept in breast and colorectal cancer, as well as its EGFR-targeted ADC candidate ALX2004. Due to its preclinical cost-cutting, ALX now expects its cash runway to extend into the fourth quarter of next year.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nMarch 6\n\nBristol Myers Squibb will lay off 57 workers from its Redwood City, California facility next month, according to a WARN notice filed on February 26. The latest layoff, first reported by Fierce Pharma, is part of a billion-plus-dollar cost-cutting program announced last year and expanded last month. BMS laid off more than two thousand employees in 2024 in total. According to BMS\u2019 website, its Redwood City R&D campus is focused on the tumor microenvironment.\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics\n\nMarch 5\n\nFor the second time this year and following its decision to pause two CAR T programs, Atara Biotherapeutics has divulged a roughly 50% workforce reduction, according to a March 3 SEC filing. The Thousand Oaks, California\u2013based biotech disclosed in January it would let go the same percentage of employees.\n\nAtara could have around 40 people left once both rounds of cuts\u2014expected to be mostly complete by June\u2014are done, given it had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12 SEC filing. The biotech did not specify which locations the latest workforce reduction will affect. In addition to its headquarters in Thousand Oaks, it also has an Aurora, Colorado, location.\n\nIn its latest SEC filing, Atara disclosed it\u2019s discontinuing development activities for and pausing its ATA3219 and ATA3431 programs. The move will include ending all clinical studies evaluating ATA3219, an allogeneic anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor CAR T cell therapy the company had been testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics\n\nMarch 3\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics is laying off an undisclosed number of employees, Endpoints News and Fierce Biotech reported. A company spokesperson would not tell Endpoints or Fierce how many staffers are affected.\n\nThe biotech, a wholly owned subsidiary of Switzerland-based CRISPR Therapeutics AG, has its research and development headquarters in Boston and an R&D hub in San Francisco. It also has a manufacturing facility in Framingham, Massachusetts.\n\nCRISPR in January announced it was starting the year with a strong balance sheet, citing about $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The company also noted its 2025 priorities will include the ongoing launch of Casgevy, a gene editing therapy it developed with Vertex Pharmaceuticals. The drug has seen strong global patient demand, and Vertex has made significant progress in activating authorized treatment centers and securing payer access, according to the announcement.\n\nCytiva\n\nMarch 3\n\nCytiva, a U.K.-based life sciences technologies and services company, will let go 85 people in Westborough, Massachusetts, starting March 7, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The layoffs will continue through at least March 31. The company has not formally announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nCytiva\u2019s recent news includes a January announcement that it is partnering with U.K-based Cellular Origins to provide automated robotic manufacturing capabilities for cell and gene therapies. By combining Cytiva\u2019s manufacturing technologies with Cellular\u2019s robotic manufacturing platform, the companies aim to help cell and gene therapy manufacturers scale up production to industrial levels without changing the process used during discovery phases or clinical trials.\n\nEisai\n\nMarch 3\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring, Tokyo-based Eisai is cutting 6.8% of its U.S. workforce, primarily in its commercial, medical and corporate functions, a company spokesperson on Feb. 27 told BioSpace via email. The move, which will affect 121 employees, is part of the pharma\u2019s strategy to improve operations and ensure long-term sustainability, according to the spokesperson.\n\nEisai\u2019s cuts include letting go 57 employees from its U.S. headquarters in Nutley, New Jersey, with those layoffs effective starting March 31 and wrapping up May 30, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The company spokesperson did not specify which other locations the workforce reduction will affect, but U.S. operations include sites in Baltimore; Exton, Pennsylvania; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nRegarding its U.S. business moving forward, the spokesperson said that \u201cEisai remains fully committed to the U.S. market and will continue to serve the needs of patients and their families, particularly in addressing unmet medical needs in areas such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and other neurological conditions.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 28\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is continuing to slim down its Lawrenceville, New Jersey, workforce, this time by 223 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. This brings the total number of those let go this year in that city to 290, as the pharma earlier this month disclosed it would lay off 67 people there.\n\nThe latest round of cuts will be effective starting May 22 and wrapping up Aug. 1. While BMS has two sites in Lawrenceville, It\u2019s unclear if the layoffs will affect one or both of those. A spokesperson for the Princeton, New Jersey\u2013based company had not confirmed details of the layoff to BioSpace as of press time.\n\nRegarding the latest layoffs, the spokesperson told BioSpace via email that \u201cWe are optimizing operations across the company while prioritizing investments in innovative and transformational medicines where we can deliver the highest value for patients and shareholders. Unfortunately, there have been impacts to some of our employees as a result of these changes.\u201d\n\nBMS in April 2024 announced it would eliminate about 2,200 jobs by the end of last year as part of a bid to generate approximately $1.5 billion in costs savings through 2025. Some cuts were effective in 2024 and others are effective this year. Lawrenceville\u2019s reported layoffs from those job eliminations totaled over 1,300 people.\n\nBMS announced earlier this month that the strategic reorganization that began last year will go even deeper. The company is aiming for $2 billion in savings through 2027. Those savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency, according to a fourth quarter earnings release.\n\nLava Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nWith just one product in clinical development, Lava Therapeutics is considering strategic options that could include a sale, merger or acquisition and will cut 30% of its staff, the biotech announced Feb. 25. The clinical-stage immuno-oncology company did not specify if the workforce reduction will affect both its Utrecht, The Netherlands, headquarters and its Philadelphia office.\n\nLava expects to complete the cuts by July 31 and to incur about $500,00 in related costs, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The company had 37 employees, mostly in Europe, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March 2024 SEC filing, meaning the cuts could leave the biotech with about 25 people.\n\nAs it considers its strategic options, Lava will continue enrolling patients in its Phase I clinical study evaluating LAVA-1266 in hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, according to the announcement. It will also still support its pharma partnerships with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, which involve its Gammabody platform of bispecific gamma delta T cell engagers.\n\nLava recently adjusted its pipeline, announcing in December that it would discontinue development of prostate cancer asset LAVA-1207. At that time, the company said it had extended its cash runway into 2027 based on a cash balance of $78.9 million as of Sept. 30. Lava had $76.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of Dec. 31, according to the Feb. 25 announcement.\n\nRyvu Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nAs part of a strategic reorganization that will extend its cash runway into the second half of 2026, Ryvu Therapeutics will cut about 30% of its workforce, the Krak\u00f3w, Poland\u2013based biotech announced Feb. 25. The move will leave the clinical-stage drug discovery and development company with approximately 200 employees as it focuses on advancing its blood cancer program RVU120 and early-stage assets.\n\nThree Phase II studies of RVU120 are in progress: RIVER-81, a combination study with venetoclax for acute myeloid leukemia (AML); POTAMI-61, a monotherapy/combination study with ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis; and REMARK, a monotherapy study for lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ryvu is suspending new patient enrollment in its Phase II RIVER-52 study of RVU120 monotherapy for AML or higher-risk MDS. The biotech expects its next data update for RVU120 in the second quarter.\n\nRyvu had about 46 million euros ($48.3 million) in cash and other financial assets as of Feb. 23, according to the announcement. It\u2019s also secured approximately 22 million euros ($23.1 million) in nondilutive grant funding.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nLess than a year after cutting about 25% of its workforce, Repare Therapeutics has divulged it will axe approximately 75% of its staff, including its chief medical officer, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The Montreal-based biotech had 179 employees as of Feb. 24, 2024, according to an April SEC filing, meaning that once the latest layoffs are complete, it may have fewer than 35 people remaining.\n\nIn addition to its corporate headquarters in Montreal, Repare has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company did not specify in the SEC filing if the layoffs will affect one or both sites. Repare informed affected employees Feb. 24 and expects to mostly complete the reorganization by the fourth quarter.\n\nMaria Koehler, executive vice president and chief medical officer, will depart on March 31. Repare intends to keep her on in a consulting capacity for three months after her separation date, according to the Feb. 25 SEC filing.\n\nThe latest layoffs were expected, as the company in January announced planned headcount reductions, although without offering details about the cuts. Repare also shared then that it had reprioritized its pipeline to focus on advancing its Phase I clinical programs: PLK4 inhibitor RP-1664 and Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor RP-3467.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 20\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics has shut down its operations, according to several media reports on Wednesday. The biotech had over 40 staff at its peak, according to Endpoints News.\n\nSpotlight was built around an in vivo gene editing platform called Targeted Active Gene Editor, or TAGE, which resembles an antibody-drug conjugate but instead carries a CRISPR-Cas payload. The biotech was established in 2018 with expertise from some of the biggest names in CRISPR\u2014including U.C. Berkeley\u2019s Patrick Hsu\u2014and with support from Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm GV (previously Google Ventures).\n\nThe promise of Spotlight\u2019s approach attracted $30 million in Series A funding in 2020 to help leverage TAGE against immuno-oncology indications and blood disorders. But the approach failed to pan out in the laboratory. A preprint published in bioRxiv in late December 2024 showed that TAGE had underwhelming editing efficiency in mice, reaching an average of 7% even when delivered directly into their eyes.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 20\n\nCharles River Laboratories is trimming the workforce at its Memphis, Tennessee, cell and gene therapy facility, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson for the Wilmington, Massachusetts\u2013based company told Fierce the layoffs came \u201cafter careful consideration of all options\u201d and would not specify how many employees are affected.\n\nThe workforce cut won\u2019t be the only one this year at Charles River, which provides products and services to biopharma companies. The company is closing its Durham County, North Carolina, facility and letting go 31 employees there, according to a Jan. 27 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nCharles River has recently had a series of staff cuts. In November, Endpoints News reported following an earnings call that the company had let go more than 6% of its employees, representing over 1,300 people, since 2023. The business noted during the call it had begun to close or consolidate 15 smaller sites given lower demands for its products and services.\n\nThe company had about 20,100 employees as of Dec. 28, according to a Feb. 19 SEC filing.\n\nKojin Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 17\n\nDue to funding challenges, Boston-based Kojin Therapeutics will soon shut down, affecting 25 employees, Endpoints News reported Feb. 14. Kojin CEO Harvey Berger told Endpoints the biotech was months away from selecting a development candidate for its lead small molecule.\n\nThe company shared its plans to wind down in the coming months in a Feb. 13 LinkedIn post. In that post, Kojin noted it had made progress in developing first-in-class small molecule ferroptosis inducers for potential use in patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, it added, it\u2019s been difficult to obtain sufficient funding to move programs forward into Investigational New Drug\u2013enabling studies and clinical trials.\n\nKojin launched in 2021 with a $60 million Series A round. The company has been focused on discoveries in cell-state and ferroptosis biology to develop treatments for use in patients with various forms of cancer as well as cardiovascular, immunologic, hepatic and degenerative diseases. Ferroptosis-modulating medicines can either induce or inhibit regulated cell death, creating opportunities to intervene in human ferroptosis pathways, according to Kojin\u2019s website.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the biotech noted, \u201cWe are very proud of what we have accomplished scientifically in the past year and hope that ferroptosis-specific medicines will reach patients in need of better treatment options soon.\u201d\n\nModerna\n\nFeb. 17\n\nModerna is cutting 10% of roles\u2014about 50 employees\u2014within two digital departments, Fierce Pharma reported Feb. 13, the day before the biotech detailed higher-than-expected losses for the fourth quarter of 2024. The layoffs are part of Moderna\u2019s ongoing cost efficiency efforts, according to a company spokesperson\u2019s statement to Fierce.\n\nThe company on Feb. 14 reported total revenue of $966 million for Q4 2024, down from $2.81 billion in Q4 2023. Full-year revenue also declined, dropping from $6.8 billion in 2023 to $2.81 billion last year.\n\nIn a Jan. 6 shareholder letter, Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel wrote that by the end of 2024, the company had reduced its cash operating cost by nearly 25% compared to the prior year. He also said the biotech expects to \u201ccontinuously reduce annual research and development costs, through portfolio prioritization and cost efficiencies, such that by 2027 we will plan to spend approximately $1.1 billion less per year compared to 2024.\u201d\n\nEncoded Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 14\n\nTo extend its cash runway and help advance its pipeline, Encoded Therapeutics has let go 29% of its workforce, primarily within its technology and early-stage research and development functions, the company announced Feb. 13. The move will allow the San Francisco\u2013based clinical-stage genetic medicines biotech to keep operating through the third quarter of 2026.\n\nThe company has around 200 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the workforce reduction could affect around 60 people and leave Encoded with about 140 staffers. The biotech did not say if the cuts affect only the San Francisco location or also its Research Triangle Park facility in Morrisville, N.C.\n\nExtending its runway will help the company achieve several key milestones, including preliminary clinical safety and efficacy for ETX101, according to the announcement. ETX101 is Encoded\u2019s lead program, designed to address the underlying cause of Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. The company expects to complete dosing and share preliminary safety and efficacy data in the second half of the year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nThird Harmonic Bio\n\nFeb. 12\n\nThird Harmonic Bio on Tuesday announced a strategic corporate realignment initiative that will include a 50% reduction of its workforce.\n\nThe move comes as the biotech prepares to push its oral KIT inhibitor THB335 into Phase II development. Third Harmonic is suspending all R&D work not related to THB335 and is currently weighing options to \u201cmaximize shareholder value,\u201d including \u201cthrough a strategic transaction and/or business combination.\u201d\n\nThird Harmonic had around $285 million in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of 2024, enough to support its operations through June 2024, after accounting for expenses related to THB335\u2019s Phase II preparations and costs associated with the restructuring.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Third Harmonic unveiled Phase I clinical data for THB335 demonstrating a dose-dependent reduction in serum tryptase levels, a biomarker of mast cell activation. The candidate was also safe and tolerable, with side effects that were manageable or resolved through follow-up. Third Harmonic is testing THB335 for chronic spontaneous urticaria.\n\nQ32\n\nFeb. 12\n\nQ32 Bio will cut an undisclosed number of employees as part of a strategic restructuring that includes focusing on advancing its bempikibart clinical development program for the treatment of patients with alopecia areata. The Waltham, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech expects the move will help extend its cash runway to the second half of 2026, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nAs part of the restructuring, the company is also discontinuing its Phase II renal basket clinical trial of ADX-097 and evaluating strategic options for its tissue-targeted complement inhibitor platform, including its ADX-097 and early-stage assets.\n\nTo further advance bempikibart, Q32 plans to extend dosing of eligible patients from Part A of its Phase II clinical trial and start dosing patients in Part B in the first half of 2025. The company expects to have Part B topline data in the first half of 2026.\n\nInventiva\n\nFeb. 12\n\nAs it moves to focus exclusively on developing lanifibranor for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, French biotech Inventiva is laying off half its employees. The company expects to implement the workforce reduction in the second quarter, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nInventiva had about 115 employees on Feb. 11, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the layoffs could affect less than 60 people.\n\nAs part of its pipeline shift, the biotech will stop all preclinical research activities except those that support the lanifibranor program. That includes ending work on its primary oncology program meant to disrupt the interaction between YAP and TEAD that occurs along the Hippo signaling pathway.\n\nInventiva in early January finished patient screening in a Phase III clinical trial testing lanifibranor in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). More than 95% of participants have been randomized, and enrollment should be complete within the first half of this year, with top-line results in the second half of 2026, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nViracta Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 7\n\nViracta Therapeutics announced Feb. 5 that it would shut down its operations and lay off all remaining employees, which may have been under 20 people after recent workforce cuts. The closure and terminations, approved by the biotech\u2019s board of directors Feb. 3, took effect at 5 p.m. PST on Feb. 5.\n\nThe news marked the end of what had been a tough few months for Cardiff, California\u2013based Viracta. In August 2024, the biotech announced a resource realignment initiative that involved a 23% reduction in its headcount. At the time, the company also decided to pause work on Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) solid tumors and instead focus on EBV+ lymphomas.\n\nA few months later, in November 2024, Viracta announced it had laid off 42% of remaining staff in an attempt to divert even more resources into its lymphoma program. In December, the company was forced to terminate the program for EBV+ lymphoma in an effort \u201cto maximize its cash runway\u201d as the board searched for another route to solvency. Then, last month, Viracta was delisted from Nasdaq for failing to comply with the minimum share price requirement.\n\nBased on a recent SEC filing that put the number of employees at 26 prior to the cuts announced in November, the company may have had around 15 people on staff prior to the company\u2019s closure.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals\n\nFeb. 7\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals announced Feb. 6 it is laying off 43 people, about 30% of its employees worldwide. The move will leave the company with around 100 staff members.\n\nThe Boston-based business is closing a \u201cresearch center of excellence\u201d in Vienna, Austria, and pausing all preclinical drug candidates, according to a statement. The layoffs and scale-back of operations will save the company between $30 million and $35 million.\n\nThe news comes less than a year after X4 got FDA approval for mavorixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist now marketed as Xolremdi, for the treatment of an immunodeficiency syndrome known as WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and myelokathexis) syndrome. At the time, the company stated that it was the first FDA approval specifically targeted for the disorder.\n\nLast month, X4 signed a licensing deal with Norgine, a European pharma company, to commercialize mavorixafor in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. That deal netted X4 \u20ac28.5 million ($29.55 million) up front and up to \u20ac226 million ($234.29 million) in regulatory and commercial milestones.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 7\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\u2019s strategic reorganization rolls on with an additional $2 billion in savings planned through 2027 on top of an ongoing program that had targeted $1.5 billion in cost cuts by the end of 2025. The dramatic upheaval of the BMS business, spurred when CEO Chris Boerner took the helm in 2023, has been painful, with layoffs and program discontinuations.\n\nThe New Jersey pharma explained in its fourth quarter earnings release that the new savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency. The goal is to become a \u201cleaner, more efficient company while investing behind growth brands and promising areas of science,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nWorkforce cuts will include contract positions, open roles and attrition, Endpoints News reported.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nFrontier Medicines\n\nFeb. 6\n\nTo focus resources where they\u2019ll have the greatest impact, Frontier Medicines, a clinical-stage precision medicine company, will cut an unknown number of employees, Fierce Biotech reported Feb. 5.\n\nThe San Francisco-based biotech, which also has a location in Boston, is streamlining operations to ensure it can \u201cremain positioned and well-capitalized\u201d to deliver on the potential of its pipeline, a spokesperson told Fierce via email. The company has not formally announced the layoffs, which locations they\u2019ll affect or when they\u2019ll be effective.\n\nFrontier\u2019s lead program is FMC-376, a KRAS G12C dual inhibitor. The company in February 2024 announced it had closed an oversubscribed $80 million Series C funding round to advance FMC-376. Frontier noted at that time that it had dosed its first patient in the Phase I/II PROSPER trial, testing the inhibitor in patients with G12C-mutated KRAS cancers. The company expects interim clinical data for FMC-376 in the second half of this year, according to a Jan. 9 press release.\n\nKyowa Kirin\n\nFeb. 5\n\nJapanese pharma Kyowa Kirin will cut 52 employees at its Princeton, New Jersey, location effective May 1, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The site houses commercial and corporate functions, clinical development and operations, supply chain and quality teams.\n\nThe company, which has not announced the cuts or reasons behind them, restructured its workforce last year as well. In August, Kyowa offered voluntary early retirement to employees in connection with its transition to becoming a global research organization that will support its focus on advanced antibody technologies and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. That transition included significantly reducing the pharma\u2019s in-house small molecule drug discovery research activities and decreasing chemistry, manufacturing and controls research and quality-related activities.\n\nIn other recent organizational news, Kyowa in October announced it was setting up a new leadership structure that will be effective in March. The company is promoting Masashi Miyamoto from president to chairman and CEO, and Abdul Mullick from chief international business officer to president and chief operating officer. The CEO-COO team is meant to help support the company\u2019s continued growth, according to the announcement.\n\nOmega Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 5\n\nDespite a 2024 collaboration with obesity giant Novo Nordisk, Omega Therapeutics appears to have reached the end of its rope, with bankruptcy looming just ahead and staff cuts already happening. As its cash runway fizzles, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based epigenomic medicines company has entered into a restructuring support agreement with its founder, Flagship Pioneering.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated Jan. 29, Omega has until Feb. 10 to commence bankruptcy proceedings and go through a sale process with Pioneering Medicines, an affiliate of Flagship Pioneering, to potentially wind down operations. The company will provide a bridge loan of about $1.4 million upon the signing of the agreement.\n\nOmega had previously warned investors of its cash concerns in a November SEC filing, which stated the company had only enough capital to take it into the second quarter of 2025. Omega attempted to cut costs last March when it laid off 35% of its workforce, representing more than 30 staffers based on its headcount at the end of 2023. The most recent layoffs could leave the company with around 40 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 4\n\nAs its sweeping cost-cutting initiative rolls on, Bristol Myers Squibb revealed that it will downsize its New Jersey headcount by 67, as per a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday.\n\nThe layoffs will take effect from April through December of the year.\n\nBMS first unveiled its \u201cstrategic productivity initiative\u201d alongside its first-quarter 2024 earnings report in April that year, targeting to save approximately $1.5 billion through 2025. Through the realignment program, the pharma plans to minimize management layers and prioritize key growth brands while lowering third-party expenditures. Around 2,200 jobs are on the chopping block.\n\nLast month, BMS turned its back on two development partners\u2014Immatics and Century Therapeutics. The pharma was supposed to work with Immatics on allogeneic T cell receptor and/or CAR T therapies, while its partnership with Century was focused on stem cell-derived natural killer cell or T cell therapies for hematologic malignancies. Both biotechs reported that BMS terminated the partnerships as part of a \u201cportfolio prioritization\u201d push.\n\nTurnstone Biologics\n\nFeb. 4\n\nTurnstone Biologics is making major moves, cutting an undisclosed number of staff as it explores strategic alternatives and halts further development of its TIDAL-01 program, the clinical-stage biotech announced Feb. 4. The strategic alternatives could include an acquisition, merger, business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other transactions. Turnstone indicated it intends to retain employees \u201cessential for supporting value-realization as part of its strategic review.\u201d\n\nThis marks the second recent shakeup at the La Jolla, California\u2013based company. In October, Turnstone announced it would cut about 60% of its employees, leaving the biotech with 30 people, according to a November SEC filing. It also disclosed it was adjusting its leadership team and shifting its pipeline to focus on clinical advancement of its selected tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy via TIDAL-01. The biotech was evaluating TIDAL-01 in multiple Phase I trials including in colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and uveal melanoma.\n\nTurnstone had indicated it would provide a clinical update in the first half of 2025. Now, the company has announced it\u2019s discontinuing all clinical studies evaluating TIDAL-01. It\u2019s also implementing further cost-containment and cash conservation measures, according to the Feb. 4 announcement.\n\nThe company had an accumulated deficit of $234.7 million and $45.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of Sept. 30, according to the November SEC filing.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 4\n\nCharles River Laboratories will be closing down its site in Durham County, North Carolina, leading to the termination of 31 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday. In a statement to Endpoints News, a company representative said that the facility was no longer \u201ca strategic fit\u201d for the organization.\n\nThe layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Charles River reported a revenue of $1.01 billion, down 1.6.% from the same period the year prior. The dip was driven by the lower performance of its Discovery and Safety Assessment unit, the company noted at the time.\n\nCharles River is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings report on Feb. 19.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n\nFeb. 3\n\nJust months after disclosing it would cut employees at its Cambridge and Plainville, Massachusetts, locations, Thermo Fisher Scientific has announced a fresh round of layoffs at those viral vector sites. The Waltham-based tools and services company will let go 300 people across the two facilities, according to a Jan. 31 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those cuts will be effective March 30.\n\nIn November, Thermo Fisher disclosed via WARN notices it would lay off 160 people across its Cambridge, Lexington and Plainville sites, effective between Jan. 6, 2025, and Nov. 6, 2026. At that time, the Boston Business Journal reported the company will close the Lexington facility, transferring programs from there to Plainville. The 290,000-square-foot Plainville location provides comprehensive viral vector services, including commercial manufacturing.\n\nThe Cambridge and Plainville cuts were disclosed at about the same time Thermo Fisher announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results. The company shared that while fourth-quarter revenue grew 5% year over year, full-year revenue was flat at $42.8 billion.\n\nFractyl Health\n\nFeb. 3\n\nMetabolic therapeutics company Fractyl Health announced Jan. 31 it will prioritize a pivotal clinical trial aimed at weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal while shuttering another trial and laying off 17% of its workforce.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing, the layoffs amount to 22 people, indicating Fractyl had 129 employees prior to the layoffs. The savings, following $1.8 million paid out in severance and other related fees, will extend the company\u2019s runway into 2026, according to the news release.\n\nFractyl has two main products in development\u2014an endoscopy treatment called Revita designed to resurface the lining of the duodenum, and an AAV gene therapy called Rejuva, which aims to modify pancreatic cells to restore GLP-1 pathway function in islet cells. The company cites Revita as an \u201coff-ramp\u201d to injectable GLP-1 treatments for obesity and diabetes.\n\nFractyl\u2019s shift in priorities means it is pausing development of Revita and its associated REVITALIZE-1 trial in type 2 diabetes and focusing on Revita\u2019s pivotal REMAIN-1 trial in weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal, along with Rejuva, which is set to initiate first-in-human studies in this first half of this year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nImmunityBio\n\nFeb. 3\n\nImmunityBio\u2019s layoffs are continuing into 2025, with the San Diego\u2013based biotech cutting 10 employees in California effective March 25, according to Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notices. The company has not announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nThe biotech had 672 employees as of Sept. 30, according to a Nov. 12 SEC filing. Given ImmunityBio let go 31 people over the course of October and November, this means the new cuts\u2014nine in El Segundo and one in Culver City\u2014 could leave the company with around 630 staffers.\n\nAt the same time that ImmunityBio is trimming its workforce, it\u2019s also moving forward with a new collaboration involving Anktiva, its FDA-approved immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, according to a Jan. 29 announcement. The company has entered into a collaboration and supply agreement with BeiGene, a global oncology company, to conduct a confirmatory randomized Phase III clinical trial combining BeiGene\u2019s a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) tislelizumab and Anktiva in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nRentschler Biopharma\n\nJan. 31\n\nAs part of its exit from the cell and gene therapy space, contract development and manufacturing organization Rentschler Biopharma will cease operations at its Stevenage, U.K., site, affecting employees there, the company announced Jan. 30. A Rentschler spokesperson told Endpoints News via email that the move could affect up to 30 people, and the Laupheim, Germany\u2013based company will provide resources to help them find other opportunities.\n\nThe CDMO is withdrawing from cell and gene therapy as part of a long-term strategic shift so it can focus on biologics, according to the announcement.\n\nIn that press release, CEO Benedikt von Braunm\u00fchl stated, \u201cThe cell and gene therapy market has experienced slower-than-expected growth, with demand across the industry not meeting our expectations. Following a comprehensive strategic review, we are focusing our efforts on areas where we see the greatest demand and potential to create value sustainably.\u201d\n\nCargo Therapeutics\n\nJan. 31\n\nCargo Therapeutics is a little lighter\u2014on both the pipeline and workforce front\u2014as the CAR T\u2013focused biotech announced Jan. 29 that it is discontinuing a mid-stage study of its lead candidate and parting with approximately half of its employees. The company is letting go 81 people effective April 1, according to a Jan. 30 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice.\n\nJefferies analysts in an investor note Jan. 30 called the news a \u201csurprise disappointment\u201d as the Phase I study had showed a 50% complete response rate and long multi-year durability of firicabtagene autoleucel (firi-cel)\u2014an autologous CD22 CAR T cell therapy.\n\nCargo had 170 employees as of Sept. 30, 2024, according to a Nov. 13 SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave the company with about 85 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCorrection (Feb. 4): This entry was updated to change the number of employees let go to 81 and add the effective date based on a WARN notice published today.\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 31\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals on Wednesday announced a steep workforce reduction initiative that will allow it to lower its spending and \u201cis intended to position the company for long-term growth.\u201d\n\nThe news of the layoffs comes as Boston-based Ironwood unveiled its 2025 revenue guidance, expecting to make between $260 million to $290 million\u2014a range that falls far below the $340 million consensus by analysts, according to SeekingAlpha. Ironwood dipped around 7% in after-hours trading Wednesday.\n\nApproximately 50% of the company\u2019s employees will be affected by the layoffs, mostly those working in its field force, the biotech revealed in its news release. The workforce reduction should be mostly complete by the end of June, leaving Ironwood with about 120 employees, according to a Jan. 29 SEC filing.\n\nWhile the company has operations in Basel, Switzerland, it did not specify if the cuts will affect staff there.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 30\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals announced Jan. 28 it is cutting about 40% of its workforce in what it called a \u201cstrategic restructuring\u201d as the biotech goes all in on bringing its lead candidate to the market.\n\nAccording to Zentalis, the move aims to extend the company\u2019s cash runway until late 2027, with the hope of getting beyond a Phase II data readout for azenosertib in ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer.\n\nThe company had 168 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a Feb. 27, 2024, SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave it with about 100 employees.\n\nAlong with the restructuring, Zentalis reported mid-trial data from azenosertib from the MAMMOTH and DENALI studies on Jan. 29, showing a 5.5 month median duration of response and \u201cno new safety signals.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nI-Mab\n\nJan. 30\n\nI-Mab will cut 27% of staff weeks after announcing a reprioritization of its pipeline to focus on a Phase I bispecific antibody.\n\nThe move will cost the Maryland-based immuno-oncology company about $300,000 but is estimated to save about $3 million overall. I-Mab expects the realignment to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2025, it noted in its Jan. 28 SEC filing. According to 2023 filings, I-Mab had 220 total employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, though most worked at a divested China operation.\n\nThe company had just under 135 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 29, meaning the cuts could leave it with fewer than 100 employees.\n\nThe layoffs follow an announcement in early January that I-Mab will re-prioritize resources to focus on advancing lead molecule givastomig, a CLDN18.2 and 4-1BB bispecific antibody for certain metastatic gastric cancers. The candidate is currently in Phase Ib trials in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo and chemotherapy, with data readouts expected in the second half of 2025. Other trials featuring givastomig are expected to readout in 2026.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics let go an undisclosed number of employees last week, Endpoints News reported.

However, about a dozen had \u201copen to work\u201d designations on their profile photos.\n\nAffini-T is developing T cell receptor (TCR)\u2013based immunotherapies for solid tumors. It has two autologous TCR T cell therapy programs in the clinical stage and two in the preclinical stage, according to its website. Three bispecific T cell engagers are in the discovery stage.\n\nEndpoints noted that Knowles had previously told the publication that the biotech\u2019s launch-round funding would take it through December 2024.

Two months later, it announced it had raised $175 million in initial financing.\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nFollowing the FDA\u2019s rejection of Atara Biotherapeutics\u2019 T cell therapy for a transplant-related blood cancer and a related clinical hold, the company divulged that it will cut about 50% of its workforce. The biotech expects to mostly complete the layoffs by June, according to a Jan. 27 SEC filing.\n\nAtara had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12, 2024, SEC filing, which means the layoffs could leave the company with around 80 employees.

About a week later, the FDA took the additional step of placing a clinical hold on the biotech\u2019s active Investigational New Drug applications due to the same manufacturing concerns that led to Ebvallo\u2019s rejection. In addition to Ebvallo, the hold also affected the company\u2019s allogeneic CD19 CAR T therapy ATA3219, which it\u2019s testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase 1 results. The move will leave the San Carlos, California\u2013based biotech with about 15 employees as it explores strategic alternatives and winds down the trial, according to the Jan. 27 announcement.\n\nAlthough AK006 was well tolerated, preclinical inhibitory effects observed did not translate to clinical benefit in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), a skin condition that causes hives, according to a statement by Chin Lee, Allakos chief medical officer, in the press release. In the Phase 1 trial, patients taking AK006 did not show significant improvement in their symptoms as compared with the placebo group.\n\nThis is not the first time Allakos has ditched a CSU candidate. In January 2024, the company announced it would halt its humanized IgG1 antibody lirentelimab. It also noted it would cut about 50% of its employees and focus its efforts and resources on AK006 and additional preclinical programs.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase I results.

The staff cuts, first reported by Endpoints News, come as Biogen\u2019s stock languishes in a five-year low.\n\nThe company is looking to \u201creinvigorate\u201d its drug discovery machinery, according to the spokesperson. \u201cThe aim is to be more agile, efficient, and effective to deliver more viable drug candidates to the clinic.\u201d\n\nThe workforce reduction is among the first sweeping strategic moves by new research head Jane Grogan, who took charge of the department in October 2023.\n\nGrogan, who was previously chief scientific officer at Graphite Bio, was appointed amid Biogen\u2019s aggressive cost-cutting program announced in July 2023, which put around 1,000 jobs\u2014or approximately 11% of the company\u2019s headcount\u2014on the chopping block. The layoffs are expected to continue this year, with an eye toward saving $1 billion in operating expenses.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNotch Therapeutics\n\nJan. 17\n\nTo preserve cash and \u201cexplore alternate paths forward,\u201d Notch Therapeutics will significantly reduce its workforce, the Vancouver, British Columbia\u2013based company announced on LinkedIn Jan. 16. Fierce Biotech first reported the news.\n\nNotch, which is developing T cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune conditions, has three locations, including one in Seattle and another in Toronto. It did not specify how many people it will let go or which sites the cuts will affect. There are 67 LinkedIn members who list Notch as their employer as of the morning of Jan. 17.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the company wrote, \u201cThe biotech market has faced significant challenges over the last few years, with early-stage cell therapy companies being significantly affected. Unfortunately, Notch is not immune from this environment. While we have made considerable progress, securing additional investment and/or additional partners to take our research forward remains challenging.\u201d\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 14\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals on Monday announced that it was letting go of 40 employees. The workforce reduction is part of the biotech\u2019s effort to prioritize its commercial efforts in the U.S.\u2014meaning that the layoffs will affect employees located overseas.\n\nAlongside the layoffs, Apellis also announced that its chief operating officer Adam Townsend will step down from his role effective Feb. 21 to pursue a new opportunity. Townsend has been with Apellis since 2018 and has helped \u201cestablish a world-class commercial organization,\u201d CEO Cedric Francois said in a statement.\n\nApellis disclosed these organizational changes during a preview of its fourth-quarter results at the 2025 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. The company reported $709 million in preliminary full-year U.S. net product revenues, of which $611 million came from its geographic atrophy therapy Syfovre while the remaining $98 million were contributed by Empaveli, which is indicated for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\nBy early 2025, Apellis plans to file for the label expansion of Empvali into two rare kidney diseases, complement 3 glomerulopathy and primary immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.\n\nBarinthus Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo cut costs as it prioritizes immunology and inflammation indications, Barinthus Biotherapeutics plans to axe 65% of its employees across its U.K. and Germantown, Maryland, locations, the clinical-stage biopharma announced Jan. 10. The cuts, which include two C-Suite members, are expected to help the company extend its cash runway to the start of 2027.\n\nBarinthus had 130 employees\u201495 of them in the U.K.\u2014as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing. However, it let go of 25% of its workforce in mid-2024, meaning the latest planned layoffs may affect about 64 people, leaving the company with fewer than 35 employees.\n\nAlongside the expected staff cuts, Barinthus is also postponing further development of VTP-300 in chronic hepatitis B until it identifies a partner, according to the announcement. It therefore won\u2019t invest in the drug candidate beyond completion of an ongoing Phase IIb HBV003 clinical trial.\n\nThe layoffs, which would mostly affect the U.K. workforce and should be completed during the first half of 2025, are subject to consultation with U.K. employee representatives, according to a Jan. 10 SEC filing.

It wasn\u2019t clear when the layoffs will be complete.\n\nRepare, which also has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had 179 employees as of Feb. 16, 2024, according to an SEC filing. However, in August, it announced it was letting go of 25% of its workforce, which may have left it with fewer than 135 people prior to these latest cuts.\n\nRepare is reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on continued advancement of its Phase I clinical programs: RP-1664, a PLK4 inhibitor, and RP-3467, a Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor. The company is evaluating RP-1664 as a monotherapy and RP-3467 alone and in combination with olaparib, a poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. Repare is also exploring partnerships for continued development of assets across its portfolio, including lunresertib and camonsertib, used in combination in patients with endometrial cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nPassage Bio\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo help extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2027, Passage Bio will slash its workforce by about 55%, the clinical-stage genetic medicines company announced Jan. 10. In an SEC filing, the Philadelphia-based company noted it expects to incur associated severance and exit costs of about $2 million primarily during the second quarter, indicating the staff cuts will happen quickly.\n\nPassage had 58 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing, meaning the cuts could affect about 32 people, leaving the company with 26 employees. The business has two locations, one in Philadelphia and another in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. It did not say whether the workforce reduction will affect both sites.\n\nThe company\u2019s other business moves include transitioning to an outsourced analytical testing model following an assessment of its operating needs to support advancement of its PBFT02 program, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nY-mAbs Therapeutics\n\nJan. 13\n\nAs part of a realignment that includes establishing two business units, Y-mAbs Therapeutics expects to cut about 13% of its workforce, dependent on whether some employees accept newly created positions, the company announced Jan. 10. The New York\u2013based commercial-stage biopharma had 100 employees, including 63 people in research and development roles, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. That means the layoffs could affect about 13 staffers, leaving the company with 87 employees.\n\nY-mAbs, which has locations in Nutley, New Jersey, and in Denmark, intends to move some roles from Denmark to the U.S. to more efficiently coordinate advancing its radiopharmaceutical platform, according to the announcement. It will also make a \u201csmall adjustment\u201d to the commercial team for Danyelza, its monoclonal antibody for high-risk neuroblastoma in the bone or bone marrow.\n\nRegarding its realignment, the biopharma, which is developing and commercializing novel radioimmunotherapy and antibody-based therapeutic products to treat cancer, will split into radiopharmaceuticals and Danyelza business units. This will help optimize resources and advance Y-mAbs\u2019 novel self-assembly disassembly pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (SADA PRIT) platform programs through clinical development while also driving Danyelza\u2019s commercial growth, according to the announcement. The company designed the SADA PRIT platform in part to improve upon traditional radioimmunotherapy by delivering high therapeutic dose while minimizing off-target exposure.\n\nGeneration Bio\n\nJan. 13\n\nTo support clinical development of its T cell\u2013directed medicines, Generation Bio is reorganizing, a move that includes C-suite changes, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The company will cut staff in Cambridge by 20% and expects to complete that workforce reduction by the second quarter of 2025, according to a Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nGeneration Bio had 174 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. However, it let go about 40% of its staff during the second quarter of 2024, as reported in multiple SEC filings earlier this year, including one in November. Therefore, with the latest cuts, the company may be laying off another 21 people, leaving it with 83 employees.\n\nIn its Jan. 6 announcement, Generation Bio shared it\u2019s moving toward the clinic by deploying its cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle (ctLNP) to develop siRNA therapeutics with the goal of silencing disease-driving targets in T cells. The biotech hopes that by precisely modulating T cell activity in vivo, it can address high-value, undruggable targets involved in the inflammation and tissue damage associated with T cell\u2013driven autoimmune diseases. It plans to submit its first Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the second half of 2026.\n\nAs part of its staff cuts, Generation Bio is parting ways with Matthew Stanton as chief science officer and Matthew Norkunas as chief financial officer. Stanton will exit midway through the year and become a scientific advisory board member, according to the announcement. Norkunas\u2019 last day was Jan. 10, according to the Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nIGM Biosciences\n\nJan. 13\n\nIGM Biosciences is cutting 73% of its workforce and stopping development of two autoimmune drug candidates, the biotech announced Jan. 9. Following the news, BMO Capital Markets downgraded the Mountain View, California\u2013based company\u2019s shares from outperform to market perform.\n\nThe layoffs will affect 100 employees effective March 10, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice processed Jan. 14. That means the cuts will leave the business with 37 employees.\n\nRegarding its pipeline, IGM is halting work on imvotamab and IGM-2644, bispecific antibody T cell engagers for autoimmune diseases. The biotech is also considering its next business move so it can maximize shareholder value, in part by evaluating \u201cinternal options as well as potential strategic alternatives,\u201d according to the release.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nUpdate (Jan. 17): This entry was updated to specify the number of employees being laid off, when the cuts are effective and how many people will remain with the company based on a WARN notice processed after the tracker\u2019s publication.\n\nIntellia\n\nJan. 10\n\nIntellia Therapeutics is reducing its workforce by around 27% as part of a reorganization program announced on Thursday. The company said it will focus its efforts and resources on high-value programs, specifically its investigational gene editors NTLA-2002 for hereditary angioedema and nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) for transthyretin amyloidosis. Intellia had 526 full-time employees as of mid-February 2024, according to an SEC filing.\n\nAs part of this strategic pivot, Intellia will discontinue the development of its investigational therapy NTLA-3001, which was originally being tested for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease. The biotech expects to implement the announced layoffs \u201cover the course of 2025,\u201d as per its news release.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, Intellia still had around $862 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Thursday\u2019s realignment will cost the company $8 million in one-time expenses, but will help extend its runway into the first half of 2027.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, Intellia expects to dose the first patients in the respective Phase III studies for NTLA-2002 and nex-z, with an eye toward becoming a \u201ccommercial-ready organization by the end of 2026,\u201d according to its Thursday announcement.\n\nShoreline\n\nJan. 10\n\nShoreline Biosciences is laying off a yet-undisclosed number of employees in connection with a cell therapy partnership with Gilead subsidiary Kite, Endpoints News reported on Thursday.\n\nCEO Kleanthis Xanthopoulos confirmed the workforce reduction in a phone interview with Endpoints, but declined to specify how many staffers would be affected. Regarding the partnership with Kite, Xanthopoulos said that its fate was still \u201cto be determined.\u201d\n\nKite and Shoreline partnered in June 2021, with the pharma subsidiary putting $2.3 billion on the line in upfront and milestone payments to use the biotech\u2019s induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation and reprogramming platform. According to the news release at the time, the partners would initially focus their efforts on CAR natural killer cell targets, though Kite will have the option to expand the collaboration to include a macrophage program.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Shoreline is also eligible to royalties.\n\nCalifornia-based Shoreline focuses on using what it calls \u201cintelligent engineering\u201d to produce next-generation iPSC-derived natural killer cells and macrophages, which in turn can be harnessed for gene editing.\n\nScribe\n\nJan. 9\n\nAs it gears up for clinical studies, Scribe Therapeutics on Wednesday confirmed that it will downsize by around 20%, Endpoints News reported.\n\nThe layoffs come as Scribe prepares to initiate clinical trials, CEO Ben Oakes told Endpoints. The company has yet to announce a timeline for its entry into the clinic, but Oakes noted that \u201cthe technologies we\u2019ve built have continued to prove themselves to be so strong that we can really go quite rapidly from idea to a developable drug.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2020, Scribe was co-founded by Nobel Laureate Jennifer Doudna and leverages proprietary CRISPR-based drug design and development platforms, including those that can be used to produce genetic and epigenetic editors. Its pipeline includes STX1100, which targets the PCSK9 gene to lower elevated LDL-C levels, and STX1400, designed against APOC3 and being tested for severe hypertriglyceridemia and familial chylomicronemia syndrome.\n\nScribe is also partnered with Lilly subsidiary Prevail to develop CRISPR-based therapies for neurological and neuromuscular diseases and with Sanofi to advance ex-vivo cell therapies for cancer indications.\n\nResilience\n\nJan. 9\n\nSan Diego\u2013based Resilience will lay off 120 employees at its Research Triangle Park gene therapy facility in Durham, North Carolina, effective Dec. 15, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) is cutting staff based on demand in the gene therapy sector, which requires reducing headcount in some parts of its network, a company spokesperson told Endpoints News.\n\nThe Durham layoffs aren\u2019t the only ones Resilience is making this year. The CDMO is also letting go 105 employees from its Alachua, Florida, site beginning in February and continuing through June, according to a December WARN notice.\n\nResilience bought the Durham facility from bluebird bio in 2021 and added the Alachua location after acquiring Ology Bioservices that same year.\n\nGalapagos\n\nJan. 9\n\nBy mid-2025, Galapagos will split into two entities and cut 40% of its workforce, which is expected to affect about 300 employees across its Europe operations, the Belgium-based biotech announced Jan. 8. As a result of the reorganization, the business plans to close its site in France and decrease staff in Belgium.\n\nThe new entities will be a yet-to-be-named innovative medicines specialist and a cell therapy company that will inherit the Galapagos name. The Belgian biotech will also take back the rights to its pipeline from Gilead and discontinue its small molecules program, according to the announcement.\n\nIn the press release, Galapagos CEO Paul Stoffels called the separation into two entities a \u201ccritical step\u201d for unlocking significant shareholder value, one that will position the company for sustainable growth and future success in its renewed focus on cell therapies.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCassava\n\nJan. 8\n\nCassava Sciences on Tuesday announced that it will lay off 10 employees\u2014accounting for around 33% of its headcount\u2014in an attempt to cut costs. The terminations will take place in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAside from the layoffs, Cassava will also employ \u201ccontinuing strategic expense management efforts,\u201d including halting previously planned biomarker analyses of plasma samples from prior trials. The biotech expects to absorb around $400,000 in one-time costs related to the layoffs. As of December 31, 2024, Cassava had $128.6 million in unaudited cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement comes after Cassava\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug candidate simufilam failed the Phase III RETHINK-ALZ trial in November 2024. At the time, the biotech disclosed that simufilam was unable to significantly lower cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, as compared with placebo. RETHINK-ALZ also failed its secondary and exploratory biomarker endpoints.\n\nThe readout triggered a massive selloff, sending Cassava\u2019s shares crashing 85% in the aftermath of the failure.\n\nCytomX Therapeutics\n\nJan. 8\n\nTo direct capital resources to its clinical programs and create flexibility in its cost structure, CytomX Therapeutics will cut about 40% of its employees, the San Francisco\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The exact number of people affected is 46, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice, likely leaving the biotech with fewer than 70 employees.\n\nCytomX\u2019s top strategic objective for 2025 is development of CX-2051, an antibody-drug conjugate being developed initially in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, according to the Jan. 6 announcement. Meanwhile, the biotech has noted some hesitation about CX-904, a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody it\u2019s working on with Amgen. Plans for Phase Ia completion and potential advancement to Phase Ib are \u201cpending ongoing consideration of 2025 program resourcing given CytomX current capital constraints and discussions with our partner Amgen,\u201d according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nVelia\n\nJan. 7\n\nVelia, a San Diego\u2013based biotech founded in 2021, is shutting down and eliminating its workforce, Endpoints News reported. The company has 47 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page and PitchBook.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Endpoints Jan. 6, Velia CEO John McHutchison said, \u201cWe are disappointed with this outcome, and also to have to let go of our outstanding team, and we appreciate their valuable contributions at Velia. The decision is unrelated to the therapeutic potential of microproteins, our platform and our scientific progress.\u201d\n\nEndpoints did not report when Velia\u2019s wind-down will be complete.\n\nOxular\n\nJan. 3\n\nFollowing Regeneron\u2019s acquisition of U.K.-based biotech Oxular, which develops retinal treatments, an undetermined number of Oxular employees are losing their jobs, Fierce Biotech reported Jan. 2. A Regeneron spokesperson told Fierce that no Oxular employees will join the New York\u2013based biotech, although some will provide short-term consulting help with tech transfer and transition work.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many Oxular employees the deal affected. While the biotech\u2019s LinkedIn People page shows 13 \u201cassociated members\u201d as of Jan. 3, Fierce reported the company had 20 employees upon acquisition, based on LinkedIn data at that time. The deal closed at the end of 2024, according to Fierce.\n\nRegeneron and Oxular had not announced the acquisition as of early morning Jan. 3. However, Mark Gaffney, a former Oxular board member whose role as CEO ended in June 2024, shared the news Jan. 2 on LinkedIn. In his post, he wrote, \u201cThe ophthalmology team at Regeneron is uniquely positioned to maximize the use of Oxular\u2019s proprietary technologies.\u201d\n\n2024 Layoffs Hit Multiple Companies and Thousands of Employees\n\nJavara\n\nDec. 23\n\nJavara, a North Carolina\u2013based clinical research organization, is laying off staff as the company restructures, according to Fierce Biotech. Details about the number of employees being let go was not reported.\n\n\u201cAs we look towards the future of Javara, we are focused on becoming even more agile and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of our patients, sites, healthcare partners and sponsor clients,\u201d a Javara spokesperson wrote in an email to the publication. \u201cTo reach these goals, we made the decision to reduce operational complexities and simplify select workflows.\u201d\n\nRing Therapeutics\n\nDec. 18\n\nRing Therapeutics has parted ways with \u201cjust under 50%\u201d of its employees, a spokesperson told Endpoints News on Wednesday. Ring, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass.\u2013based Flagship startup focused on gene therapy, now has about 40 staff members left.\n\n\u201cWe recently made the decision to focus on Anellobricks, Ring\u2019s proprietary genetic medicine vector platform, which affords exceptional scalability and has the potential to transform genetic medicine,\u201d the spokesperson wrote to Endpoints. \u201cAs a result, we have reduced our current staff to ensure we have the right mix of skills and capabilities to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses and we advance toward the clinic.\u201d\n\nOutlook Therapeutics\n\nDec. 17\n\nJust weeks after announcing disappointing clinical trial results for its ophthalmic drug, Outlook Therapeutics announced it\u2019s cut 23% of its workforce to help reduce costs, extend its cash runway and secure FDA approval of bevacizumab. The Iselin, New Jersey\u2013based biopharma expects the move will save $1.4 million annually, excluding workforce reduction expenses.\n\nFive employees were let go, according to a Dec. 16 SEC filing. The cuts likely leave Outlook with 16 employees.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the company announced its NORSE EIGHT clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients had failed to meet the FDA\u2019s prespecified non-inferiority endpoint at week eight. However, Outlook noted that preliminary data showed an improvement in vision, the presence of biologic activity and a continued favorable safety profile.\n\nThe company expects to announce additional trial data in January and plans to resubmit a biologics license application in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile the FDA in 2023 nixed approval for bevacizumab to treat wet AMD, the drug has European Commission marketing authorization. Outlook plans to launch bevacizumab in the European Union and the U.K. in the first half of 2025.\n\nEditas\n\nDec. 16\n\nUnable to find a development sponsor for its sickle cell disease therapy renizgamglogene autogedtemcel, Editas announced Dec. 12 it will terminate work on the ex vivo therapy and cut about 65% of its employees over the next six months. The move will affect several members of the company\u2019s management team, including Chief Medical Officer Baisong Mei.\n\nThe biotech expects these adjustments will extend its runway into the second quarter of 2027.\n\nMoving forward, Editas will focus its resources and expertise on developing in vivo CRISPR-editing assets. This pivot will capitalize on recent preclinical findings in various tissues.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBavarian Nordic\n\nDec. 12\n\nDenmark-based vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic will close its San Diego research and development (R&D) site and lay off 48 employees there, according to a Dec. 9 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. There\u2019ll be two rounds of layoffs\u2014with the first effective Dec. 13 and the second on or about March 31\u2014and the site will close on or about April 1.\n\nBavarian acquired the San Diego facility from Emergent BioSolutions in 2023 as part of a deal that gave the vaccine maker Emergent\u2019s travel health business. In addition to the R&D site, Bavarian received the rights to Vivotif, a typhoid vaccine; Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine; and CHIKV VLP, a chikungunya vaccine candidate that\u2019s now in Phase III clinical development.\n\nThe company also announced this week that it plans to buy back up to 150 million Danish kroner ($21 million) of its shares. Bavarian stated the decision should be viewed in the context of \u201cimproved visibility\u201d around its travel health business, citing events including the near-term completion of the integration of assets from Emergent. That integration, Bavarian stated, includes a \u201cfinal restructuring\u201d of the R&D organization, which it expects will generate annual savings of 50 million to 75 million Danish kroner ($7 million to $10.5 million).\n\nOnce the San Diego site closes, Bavarian\u2019s remaining U.S. presence will be its U.S. subsidiary in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBenevolentAI\n\nDec. 12\n\nBenevolentAI will cut its workforce as part of a strategic overhaul aimed at streamlining operations, reducing costs and returning to its core mission of technology in service of science, the company announced Dec. 11. The London-based business did not share how many people the workforce reduction will affect.\n\nThe layoffs are not BenevolentAI\u2019s first employee cuts. In May 2023, the company announced it would let go about 180 people as part of a reorganization designed to optimize its pipeline and technology platforms to reduce costs and maximize value for stakeholders. In April 2024, BenevolentAI announced it would cut 30% of staff. It also closed its U.S. office.\n\nMoving forward, the company will focus on creating standalone products that meet its partners\u2019 drug development needs, Kenneth Mulvany, executive chairman, founder and activist shareholder, said in the announcement. He noted that BenevolentAI\u2019s new strategic direction \u201cbuilds on our strengths, empowering the biopharma industry with cutting-edge AI technologies backed by our compelling industry and patient proof points.\u201d\n\nBased on anticipated savings from streamlined operational efforts, the company expects to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\nChroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\n\nDec. 12\n\nAs part of Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\u2019 merger, an unspecified number of employees will be laid off due to areas of redundancies and overlap, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nBoston-based Chroma and Cambridge-based Nvelop announced their merger Dec. 11. The combined entity, nChroma Bio, has secured $75 million in new financing. That money, in addition to the cash on hand for both companies at the time of the deal, will provide multiple years of runway, according to the announcement.\n\nThe funds will also aid continued development of nChroma\u2019s epigenetic editing platform and advance lead candidate CRMA-1001 into the clinic and to key data readouts. CRMA-1001 is a liver-targeted epigenetic editing therapy intended to treat chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection.\n\nCellectar Biosciences\n\nDec. 11\n\nCellectar Biosciences on Tuesday kicked off a strategic reprioritization initiative that will involve an \u201cimmediate reduction in headcount\u201d of 60%. The biotech expects to complete the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe move follows the biotech\u2019s communications with FDA regarding its cancer drug candidate iopofosine I 131. The regulator had indicated in early 2024 that Cellectar could seek accelerated approval for iopofosine I 131 using the company\u2019s ongoing CLOVER WaM trial. Now, however, the FDA has said the biotech will need to run an additional randomized and controlled confirmatory study to support a regulatory application.\n\nIn light of this change in requirements, Cellectar has decided to pursue strategic opportunities to support the further development and commercialization of iopofosine I 131. \u201cWe have determined that such a program may best be brought to market by a larger organization with greater resources,\u201d CEO James Caruso said in a statement.\n\nCellectar expects the restructuring effort to extend its cash runway into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nCarisma Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring that includes reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on fibrosis, oncology and autoimmune disease therapies, Carisma Therapeutics will lay off 34% of its employees, the Philadelphia-based biopharma announced Dec. 9. The cuts includes 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff, according to a Dec. 9 SEC filing.\n\nThe company also underwent a workforce reduction earlier this year. In April, Carisma announced it would cut staff by about 37% during the second quarter. According to an April 1 SEC filing, the company had 107 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. This would likely leave Carisma with 44 full-time employees once the latest cuts are complete.\n\nIn addition to its workforce reduction, Carisma\u2019s strategic restructuring includes ending development of CT-0525, a gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-M) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) metastasis.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBelharra Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nBelharra Therapeutics, a San Diego\u2013based startup working on small molecule oncology and immunology drugs, has cut 21 employees, leaving it with 30 people, down from 52 in June, Endpoints News reported on Dec. 9.\n\nThe employee cuts are expected to allow Belharra to extend its runway to achieve \u201ckey inflection points\u201d while alleviating capital raise pressures, according to a spokesperson\u2019s emailed statement to Endpoints. That spokesperson also wrote that the biotech will continue advancing its lead programs and working with partners Genentech and Sanofi.\n\nBelharra announced its partnership with Sanofi in June, stating that the collaboration would leverage Belharra\u2019s non-covalent chemoproteomics platform to identify and advance small molecules against undisclosed Sanofi-designated immunology targets. BioSpace named the move one of the top immunology and inflammation deals of 2024 at that time. Belharra is eligible to receive up to nearly $700 million in aggregate research, development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\n\nBelharra launched in January 2023 with $130 million in total funding that included $80 million upfront from Genentech, with whom it had inked a multiyear partnership. The biotech also received $50 million in Series A financing from Versant Ventures. In January, BioSpace named Belharra to its NextGen Bio Class of 2024 list, which recognized the hottest new life sciences companies in the U.S.\n\nDecember 9\n\nNational Resilience on Friday announced that it is laying off 105 employees from its site in Alachua, Florida, as part of a strategic refocusing initiative.\n\nThe affected employees will start being let go in February 2025, with terminations to continue through June of next year. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a Resilience spokesperson said that the CDMO is downsizing its Florida presence \u201cto focus more strategically on commercial development and manufacturing to meet customers\u2019 demands and patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nResilience will continue to fulfill its contract obligations with the customers of the Florida site, according to the spokesperson.\n\nResilience came to own the Alachua facility after it bought Ology Bioservices in April 2021. The site primarily produces drugs and biologics for commercial clients as well as the U.S. government. At the time of the acquisition deal, it had won more than $1.8 billion in government contracts.\n\nAlso on Friday, Resilience named William Marth as its new CEO.\n\nDecember 9\n\nAmplifyBio is closing up shop in South San Francisco as it lays off an unspecified number of employees in the region and terminates its R&D and characterization services, according to a report from Fierce Biotech on Friday.\n\nSome of the work in the shuttered site will move to the manufacturer\u2019s new facility in Ohio, a company spokesperson told Fierce, adding that these changes will allow AmplifyBio to \u201cintegrate early drug discovery and characterization more seamlessly\u201d with its manufacturing activities. The reorganization will also help the CDMO lower overhead costs and provide its services \u201cat more market-competitive prices,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\n\nAmplifyBio is a preclinical contract research organization and manufacturing service provider that provides discovery, characterization and optimization services, as well as in vitro and in vivo safety studies. Its work includes several treatment modalities, such as small molecule drugs, mRNA therapies and cell and gene treatments.\n\nDecember 5\n\nA week after announcing a strategic operational alignment that includes shifting two California manufacturing facilities\u2019 focus to contract biologics manufacturing, Agenus has announced employee cuts are on the way. The Lexington, Massachusetts\u2013based immuno-oncology company did not offer details on the layoffs, such as how many people they\u2019ll affect or which locations they\u2019ll involve.\n\nAccording to a March SEC filing, Agenus had 389 employees as of the beginning of that month. In addition to its Lexington headquarters, the company also has sites in Berkeley, Emeryville and Vacaville, California, and in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn its Dec. 5 announcement, Agenus noted it will concentrate resources on its lead botensilimab/balstilimab (BOT/BAL) program, which has \u201cdemonstrated robust clinical activity\u201d in several types of cancer, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). That regimen made the news earlier this year, when the FDA advised against the company applying for accelerated approval for BOT/BAL to treat relapsed/refractory MSS CRC without active liver metastases.\n\nAs Agenus moves forward with advancing BOT/BAL through clinical development and preparing for global regulatory submissions, it\u2019s also working on significant cost reductions, as noted in its Dec. 5 announcement. The company is targeting a 60% cut in annual expenditures and hopes to lower its fiscal year 2025 cash burn to about $100 million. Agenus also recently secured a $22 million mortgage to boost its cash reserves.\n\nDecember 3\n\nSwedish biotech Alligator Bioscience on Dec. 2 announced that it will lay off 70% of its employees in a sweeping strategic re-evaluation campaign.\n\nAfter the workforce reduction, the company will be down to 15 full-time staff. The layoffs, which are still subject to negotiation with trade unions, will mainly affect employees working in discovery and other nonclinical posts. Alligator expects the restructuring to lower its operating expenses by around $5.9 million annually.\n\nIn its press release, the biotech cited its \u201ccurrent capital constraints\u201d as the reason for the strategic restructuring. Alligator also noted that all but one of its assets are now \u201cunder strategic evaluation.\u201d The company will focus all of its resources on its lead asset mitazalimab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody being assessed for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nDecember 2\n\nAs part of cost-cutting measures while it looks to sell the global rights to hypertension drug aprocitentan, Idorsia Pharmaceuticals is considering cutting up to 270 positions globally, the company announced last week. The biotech expects those cuts to mainly affect its research and development and support functions at its headquarters near Basel, Switzerland. The company has one U.S. site, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nRegarding the global rights to aprocitentan, sold in the U.S. as Tryvio, Idorsia has entered into exclusive negotiations with an undisclosed company. As part of those discussions, the biotech noted it will receive a $35 million exclusivity fee that will extend its cash runway into 2025.\n\nAccording to Idorsia, the agreement under discussion could include an upfront payment, milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales in return for the transfer of global rights to the drug and some company employees. The biotech hopes to sign the agreement before the end of this year and close the deal in early 2025.\n\nIdorsia spun out of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of Actelion in 2017. In March, the company received FDA approval for Tryvio, an asset J&J gave back to the biotech in September 2023.\n\nNovember 27\n\nKronos Bio on Wednesday announced that it will trim its headcount by approximately 83% by the end of the year, as part of a previously announced cost-cutting campaign.\n\nKronos had 62 full-time employees\u2014and one part-time staff member\u2014as of March 11, 2024, according to an SEC filing. After the layoffs, the California-based biotech will have around 10 staff left. President and CEO Norbert Bischofberger is also stepping down from his role, effective Dec. 3, and will be succeeded by current COO and CFO Deborah Knobelman. Bischofberger will stay on Kronos\u2019 Board of Directors.\n\nThe company first announced its corporate overhaul earlier this month, alongside its third-quarter 2024 business report. At the time, Kronos said that it was exploring strategic alternatives moving forward, which could include a merger or reverse merger, an acquisition or other business combination, sales of its assets or other strategic transactions.\n\nKronos also at the time terminated the development of its CDK9 inhibitor istisociclib after disappointing Phase I/II data in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer.\n\nNovember 27\n\nAmidst a years-long restructuring effort, Novartis on Tuesday announced it will lay off nearly 140 more employees from in its New Jersey site, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) update.\n\nThe layoffs will start in February 2025 and run through August. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a company spokesperson confirmed the cuts and said that it will primarily affect commercial field sales teams for Xolair, Tafinlar and Mekinist. The spokesperson nevertheless maintained that these medicines will remain available to patients.\n\nNovartis in April 2022 announced a massive business transformation initiative, with an eye toward saving around $1 billion in operations costs through 2024. This effort included thousands of layoffs\u2014in June 2022, the pharma announced that up to 8,000 jobs were on the chopping block. In September 2023, Novartis also confirmed plans to spin off its generics unit Sandoz.\n\nThe layoffs come as Novartis ramps up its pipeline investments, including the potentially $1.1 billion acquisition of gene therapy specialist Kate Therapeutics to deepen its neuromuscular expertise, and the a radiopharma deal with Ratio Therapeutics, which could reach up to $745 million.\n\nNovember 27\n\nJust months after revealing its merger with fellow AI leader Exscientia, Recursion Therapeutics on Tuesday announced that it will lay off dozens of employees to minimize redundancies, according to a STAT News report.\n\nCiting a source who had been terminated, STAT noted that cuts were made across both Recursion and Exscientia. Spokesperson Ryan Kelly confirmed the workforce reduction, disclosing that less than 20% of employees were affected. Together, Recursion and Exscientia had a headcount of around 800, according to a press release last week announcing the completion of the acquisition agreement.\n\n\u201cWith any merger, there are bound to be some redundancies and leadership changes,\u201d Kelly told STAT.\n\nRecursion and Exscientia first announced the merger in August 2024, which created a combined company carrying Recursion\u2019s name with around $850 million in cash and cash equivalents\u2014plus $100 million in annual synergies\u2014which could support the combined entity into 2027. Both companies also have outstanding contracts that could yield additional milestone payments from powerhouse partners, including Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Roche and Bayer.\n\nIn total, the combined company is looking at more than 10 clinical and preclinical pipeline programs, on top of 10 advanced discovery programs and over 10 partnered programs. Many trials of its clinical candidates are expected to read out in the next 18 months.\n\nNovember 26\n\nMedigene on Tuesday kicked off a broad organizational realignment campaign as it struggles to find the resources to support its operations into 2026.\n\nPart of this program is a steep workforce reduction. Around 40% of the German biotech\u2019s employees will be let go in 2025\u2014a \u201cdifficult decision to make,\u201d according to CEO Selwyn Ho, who nevertheless noted that the layoffs are \u201ca necessary step to ensure the long-term success of Medigene.\u201d\n\nThe company will retain employees whose roles are critical for its new direction of focusing on R&D activities with the greatest potential for return on investment, as per the biotech\u2019s news release.\n\nMedigene on Tuesday also maintained its full-year 2024 guidance, including its prior estimation that its current cash runway will keep it afloat into July 2025. \u201cThe Company continues to evaluate all appropriate financing and strategic options to advance its cash runway into 2026 and beyond,\u201d according to the news release.\n\nIn 2025, Medigene will focus its resources on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided therapies, optimized for sensitivity, specificity and safety, designed specifically for use in off-the-shelf modalities. The biotech will also prioritize its TCR-guided T cell engager MDG3010 in partnership with WuXi Biologics.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAlector will let go of 41 employees\u2014or around 17% of its total headcount\u2014after revealing disappointing Phase II findings for its Alzheimer\u2019s disease antibody AL002 on Monday.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a sweeping realignment initiative, which Alector will implement to better align its resources with its new strategic priorities. Moving forward, the biotech will focus on its progranulin programs latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, which are being developed for frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the workforce reduction, Alector expects to absorb a one-time cost of $3.9 million, associated mostly with severance payments and other related expenses. According to an SEC filing on Monday, the layoffs will take place in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector had $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the biotech expects will give it enough runway through 2026.\n\nAlector was down 31% in after-hours trading on Monday, in reaction to its Alzheimer\u2019s readout.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAs part of its drive to lower expenditure by around $1.5 billion through 2025, Bristol Myers Squibb announced plans to lay off around 195 more employees from its Lawrenceville, New Jersey sites.\n\nThe terminations will start on Feb. 13, 2025 and run through the end of next year, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification record. This latest round of workforce reductions brings BMS\u2019s layoff total to nearly 1,330 this year. The job cuts started in March 2024, with 75 employees terminated. The pharma\u2019s largest layoff round came in May 2024 and affected nearly 780 members of its staff.\n\nBMS first announced its sweeping strategic initiative alongside its first-quarter earnings report in April 2024, noting that it plans to reduce management layers and streamline decision-making throughout the company. Core to this push is a headcount reduction of around 2,200 by the end of the year.\n\nThe pharma then intends to use its savings to prioritize R&D programs with the greatest return-on-investment potential, as well as those that could set it up for long-term growth. CEO Chris Boerner said at the time that these business adjustments will help BMS become \u201cmore agile\u201d and \u201cdrive efficiency across the company.\u201d\n\nThe cost cuts appear to be working. In both Q2 and Q3, the pharma beat analyst expectations, with revenues buoyed by the strong sales of products such as Eliquis and Opdivo. The pharma has also consistently raised its full-year earnings guidance\u2014further evidence of the business\u2019 robust performance.\n\nNovember 22\n\nTo streamline its organization around its most immediate priorities, Sonata Therapeutics is parting with about 20 employees, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson at the Watertown, Massachusetts, biotech told Fierce that in addition to the layoffs, founding team member Volker Herrmann is no longer leading the company. Chairman David Khougazian is now acting CEO.\n\nSonata did not tell Fierce whether it would deprioritize any of its programs. The company has been developing a new class of therapeutics\u2014which it calls network medicines\u2014meant to reprogram diseased cells to release therapeutic signals. In March, Sonata announced a research collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation to develop SNT-3012, the biotech\u2019s novel network medicine intended to treat pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, Sonata has 54 employees and five investors, including Flagship Pioneering and Altitude Life Science Ventures. The company launched in 2022 after two Flagship companies, Inzen Therapeutics and Cygnal Therapeutics, combined.\n\nNovember 22\n\nShortly after announcing it\u2019s laying off more than 200 employees, 23andMe filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices indicating it\u2019s letting go 153 employees in California and closing its South San Francisco location. The staff cuts are likely part of the previously announced workforce reduction.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 19 WARN notices, the genetic testing company will trim its workforce by 122 employees in Sunnyvale and 31 employees in South San Francisco, effective Jan. 10. The 65,340-square-foot South San Francisco location, listed as 23andMe\u2019s headquarters in a May SEC filing, will close.\n\n23andMe announced it\u2019s letting go more than 200 people Nov. 11, when it also shared that it is discontinuing development of new therapies to focus on genetic testing services and products. The company is exploring strategic opportunities for its therapeutic pipeline that could include licensing agreements, asset sales or other transactions.\n\nNovember 21\n\nDue to growing competition from rivals in China, Johnson & Johnson and Merck are letting go employees in that country, BNN Bloomberg reported, crediting Chinese media outlets as the first to cover the cuts. The J&J layoffs mainly affect a division that sells products used in surgery, while Merck is trimming its diabetes unit, sources told BNN Bloomberg.\n\nChinese media outlets reported the J&J cuts will affect as much as a fifth of the pharma\u2019s mainland workforce. A company spokesperson told BNN Bloomberg that J&J \u201chas recently implemented organizational changes to optimise our business operations.\u201d BNN Bloomberg did not report the number of employees affected at Merck.\n\nThe layoffs in China are not the only ones affecting the J&J workforce as 2024 winds down. The company is also letting go 231 employees at its New Brunswick, New Jersey, headquarters. Those cuts are effective Dec. 27.\n\nNovember 18\n\nGilead Sciences will let go 104 employees at its Foster City, California, headquarters effective March 14, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The cuts are likely part of an unspecified number of layoffs the company confirmed to BioSpace Nov. 14 that involve the company and its subsidiary, Kite Pharma. A Gilead spokesperson attributed the workforce reductions to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nGilead\u2019s layoffs that will be effective in 2025 are now known to involve at least two states, as a Washington WARN notice revealed that 72 employees in Seattle will be let go starting Jan. 17. That site, which focuses on the company\u2019s research and clinical development activities, is closing. Kite Pharma, meanwhile, will shut down its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025, Fierce Biotech reported last week.\n\nFor more details about the Gilead and Kite layoffs, read the article.\n\nNovember 18\n\nAs it redefines itself into what CEO Adrian Rawcliffe last week called a \u201csarcoma-focused business,\u201d Adaptimmune is reducing its workforce by approximately 33% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a wider cost-cutting program that the biotech expects will lower its total operating expenses by around 25% in the first year of implementation. Under this savings initiative, Adaptimmune will also end enrollment in the Phase II SURPASS-3 trial of uza-cel, its next-generation investigational TCR T cell therapy being trialed for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nAdaptimmune\u2019s business realignment comes after it last week announced a pivotal win for its TCR T cell therapy lete-cel in advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In the IGNYTE-ESO study, 42% of the 64 treated patients responded to lete-cel, including six who achieved complete response. Median duration of response reached 18.3 months in synovial sarcoma patients.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2028, Adaptimmune expects its aggregate savings to reach around $300 million, excluding one-time costs associated with the terminations. This money will allow the biotech to focus on its synovial sarcoma business, including the launch of Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel) and the development of lete-cel. Adaptimmune projects combined U.S. peak year sales of $400 million for both assets.\n\nAdaptimmune employed 449 staffers by the end of 2023, according to its year-end report.\n\nNovember 15\n\nGilead Sciences and subsidiary Kite Pharma are laying off employees, including 72 people effective Jan. 17 at Gilead\u2019s Seattle location, which will close, according to a Nov. 13 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. That site focuses on the Foster City, Calif.\u2013based biopharma\u2019s research and clinical development activities.\n\nIn addition, Fierce Biotech reported that Santa Monica, California\u2013based Kite Pharma, which focuses on cell therapy to treat and cure cancer, will close its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025.\n\nA Gilead spokesperson confirmed Gilead and Kite\u2019s layoffs to BioSpace Nov. 14 but did not specify the number of employees affected. The spokesperson attributed the layoffs to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 14\n\nTo focus its resources on advancing clinical development of SNS-101, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Sensei Biotherapeutics will cut 46% of its workforce, the clinical-stage biotech announced Nov. 14. The Rockville, Maryland\u2013based company will also close its research site in Rockville. The moves are expected to extend Sensei\u2019s cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.\n\nAccording to the announcement, most of Sensei\u2019s employee cuts will come in its preclinical research and development group. A Nov. 14 SEC filing stated the company should mostly complete the workforce reduction by the end of 2024. Once the layoffs are complete, the biotech could have about 15 employees given it had 27 full-time employees and one part-time staff member as of Feb. 23, according to a Feb. 22 SEC filing.\n\nSensei\u2019s SNS-101 inhibitor is a conditionally active antibody designed to selectively target the immune checkpoint VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell Activation) within the tumor microenvironment. The company is conducting a multicenter Phase I/II clinical trial of SNS-101 as a monotherapy and in combination with Regeneron\u2019s PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\nSensei noted in the Nov. 14 announcement that it received preliminary guidance from the FDA on the dose optimization strategy for SNS-101 and plans to re-engage with the agency following additional data from the dose expansion portion of the Phase I/II clinical trial.\n\nNovember 14\n\nJust weeks after sharing disappointing Phase III results for ganaxolone to treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, Marinus Pharmaceuticals has let go about 45% of its employees, the company announced Nov. 12.\n\nIt\u2019s the second known layoff this year for the commercial-stage pharma in Radnor, Pennsylvania. In May, Marinus revealed it would trim its workforce by about 20%. In October, it stated it would cut an unspecified number of employees. The November layoffs appear to be the culmination of that cut.\n\nMarinus had 165 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, according to a March SEC filing. As a result of the May and November cuts, the company could have about 73 employees remaining.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 13\n\nFor the second time in a year and in conjunction with a refocused pipeline, Orna Therapeutics has laid off employees, STAT News reported. The biotech based in Watertown, Massachusetts, confirmed the layoffs to STAT but did not",

            "content": "Our lawyers are handling baby powder lawsuits in all 50 states. The talcum powder lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson have been ongoing for years. The lawsuits allege that prolonged use of talcum powder (or \u201ctalc\u201d), the active ingredient in products such as Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, can cause ovarian cancer in some women.\n\nThis page provides a J&J talc power litigation update and discusses what the settlement amounts in these ovarian cancer lawsuits will be for victims.\n\nBelow are the latest talc powder lawsuit news updates and information on how to bring a claim in 2024.\n\nHas the deadline passed for you to file a talcum powder lawsuit? Many who assume the statute of limitations has passed to sue Johnson & Johnson may be wrong. But as we write this in September 2024, this settlement is about to close out. We are still signing up new clients but this may not last much longer. Call us today at 800-553-8082 or get a free and quick case review online.\n\nLatest News on J&J Talc Powder Lawsuit Update 2025\n\nOur legal team is committed to keeping you informed about the ongoing developments in the Johnson & Johnson talc litigation, a case filled with enough high-stakes twists and turns that will make for a good movie one day. Here, we provide the latest updates, ensuring you stay up to date on this legal battle in which many of you have a real stake:\n\nMarch 5, 2025:\n\nThe Talcum powder MDL remained at a standstill in February, with no new cases added. The total number of pending cases in the MDL remains at 58,206.\n\nFebruary 19, 2025:\n\nThe moment is here. This week, a critical trial began in Texas to determine the fate of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s third talcum powder bankruptcy. The two-week proceeding, overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez, will feature up to 40 witnesses and focus on allegations that the Chapter 11 filing was made in bad faith and that voting irregularities influenced the approval of a $10 billion settlement plan. The crazy part is for all that effort, there is a good chance that Judge Lopez has long made up his mind. This is really a philosophical question: you are either for this nonsense or you are not.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are of two minds on this. Some oppose the bankruptcy, arguing that client votes were improperly switched after additional compensation was negotiated. Others, citing years of litigation without client payouts as a reason to move forward with a settlement. Our position? Both sides have points but the bankruptcy is utter nonsense.\n\nFebruary 4, 2025: MDL at Standstill\n\nThe talcum powder MDL has reached a standstill, with only one new case added in January, following just four new lawsuits in December. The total number of pending cases now stands at 58,206. The bankruptcy is putting a hold in things for now as we go into the big hearing in a two weeks.\n\nJanuary 28, 2025: Settlement Holdouts\n\nSome plaintiffs are pushing back against this settlement. They argue the $8 billion settlement plan unjustly denies victims their right to pursue claims in court and challenges the legitimacy of J&J\u2019s claim that the settlement is (arguably) supported by over 80% of claimants.\n\nUnder the plan, J&J\u2019s bankrupt subsidiary, Red River Talc, would establish a trust to compensate victims based on pre-set criteria, halting all related lawsuits. The holdouts, known as the Coalition of Counsel for Justice, criticize the proposal for lacking proof that funds are sufficient, not meeting bankruptcy standards for asbestos-related cases, and alleging flaws in the voting process. J&J contends that the settlement offers more compensation than trials could and accuses opponents of acting out of financial self-interest.\n\nWe will know more next month when all of this comes to a head.\n\nJanuary 24, 2025: Why Is J&J So Desperate to Do the Settlement Via Bankruptcy?\n\nWhy is Johnson & Johnson\u2019s so obsessed to resolve the talc litigation through bankruptcy court if they are just settling the cases anyway?\n\nThe answer is rooted in a desire for control and predictability. Bankruptcy allows J&J to cap its financial liability, halting the flood of lawsuits and ensuring all current and future claims are handled through a single, centralized process. This streamlined approach eliminates the unpredictability of jury trials and opt-outs, where verdicts have ranged from modest awards to staggering punitive damages. By establishing a trust with pre-defined criteria for payouts, J&J creates uniformity in compensation while avoiding the risk of runaway verdicts that could escalate costs or set damaging legal precedents.\n\nJanuary 7, 2025: Strange Defense Verdict in Pittsburgh\n\nA talc trial in Pittsburgh concluded with a defense verdict for Johnson & Johnson but left a striking message from the jury that cannot be ignored. While the jury determined that the company\u2019s talc products did not cause the plaintiff\u2019s mesothelioma, it simultaneously awarded $22 million in punitive damages. What was the jury trying to do? Who knows? But this contradiction seemingly underscores a clear sentiment from the jury: they believed Johnson & Johnson\u2019s actions warranted punishment, regardless of the ultimate causation finding. The jury found Johnson & Johnson negligent and agreed that the company misrepresented the safety of its talc products. Although they did not link these actions to the plaintiff\u2019s illness, the decision to award punitive damages speaks volumes about the jury\u2019s perception of the company\u2019s conduct. Despite instructions not to consider punitive damages without causation, the jury\u2019s actions suggest a strong desire to hold Johnson & Johnson accountable.\n\nJanuary 3, 2025: MDL Case Count Update\n\nJust four new talc powder lawsuits were filed in the MDL last month. There are now 58,205 total pending cases.\n\nDecember 29, 2024: Where We Are Going into 2025?\n\nThe next big thing in this litigation will be the bankrupcty hearing on February 18th. This hearing will determine whether the company\u2019s proposed $10 billion bankruptcy plan can move forward and whether its Chapter 11 case will survive dismissal. For tens of thousands of cancer victims, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\n\nAt the center of the trial is J&J\u2019s controversial use of the Texas two-step bankruptcy strategy. We all know this maneuver is designed to shield the company from full accountability while limiting victims\u2019 recoveries. Some plaintiffs are fine with this. They want their money sooner rather than later. But other plaintiffs claim the plan unfairly prioritizes corporate interests over justice for those harmed by asbestos-contaminated talc products.\n\nAdding to the complexity, the trial comes on the heels of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Purdue Pharma\u2019s bankruptcy, which struck down similar third-party liability protections. This decision casts doubt on the legality of J&J\u2019s plan, particularly as allegations of voting irregularities persist. Any ruling is likely to face appeals, potentially all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nFor plaintiffs, this trial could mark a step toward justice\u2014or yet another delay in their long fight.\n\nDecember 5, 2024: Taking Down the Texas Two-Step\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren has reintroduced the Nondebtor Release Prohibition Act of 2024 to combat controversial bankruptcy strategies that allow wealthy individuals and corporations to sidestep liability. The legislation seeks to end nonconsensual litigation shields for nonbankrupt entities and codify the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling in Harrington v. Purdue Pharma, which rejected liability releases for the Sackler family in Purdue\u2019s bankruptcy. Warren also targets the \u201cTexas Two-Step\u201d maneuver, a tactic used by companies like Johnson & Johnson to isolate liabilities in a subsidiary and place it into bankruptcy, shielding the parent company from lawsuits. The bill\u2019s provisions aim to close loopholes that have allowed corporations to misuse the bankruptcy system to avoid accountability for widespread harm, such as public health crises and mass tort claims.\n\nThis legislation, while previously seen as a partisan effort by progressive Democrats, is increasingly attracting bipartisan interest. The Harrington v. Purdue Pharma decision and public outrage over corporate misuse of bankruptcy have galvanized lawmakers across party lines. Notably, a bipartisan group introduced the Ending Corporate Bankruptcy Abuse Act earlier this year to address similar issues. Republicans traditionally aligned with pro-business interests may now find common ground with Democrats on this issue, provided they can resist lobbying pressure from powerful corporate interests. As both parties face growing voter discontent over corporate accountability, this could become a rare opportunity for bipartisan reform. The Nondebtor Release Prohibition Act of 2024\u2014which could also fairly be called the Stop Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Nonsense Act\u2014would have a significant impact on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talc bankruptcy strategy, particularly its use of the Texas Two-Step maneuver. By invalidating bankruptcy filings from companies that engaged in divisional mergers to isolate liabilities within the past ten years, the bill would directly challenge J&J\u2019s effort to separate its talc liabilities into a subsidiary and shield the parent company from lawsuits. Additionally, the legislation\u2019s restriction on nonconsensual litigation shields and its requirement for explicit creditor consent would further weaken J&J\u2019s ability to impose settlements on plaintiffs without their agreement. If this law had been in place, J&J\u2019s controversial bankruptcy strategy would have never gotten off the ground.\n\nDecember 3, 2024: Wait Until March\n\nThe bankruptcy judge has ruled that baby powder lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson will remain on hold until mid-March. The pause allows J&J to pursue its bankruptcy strategy aimed at permanently resolving tens of thousands of injury claims.\n\nDuring a hearing yesterday, the judge declined to either broaden the litigation freeze to include other entities allegedly involved or lift the block to allow some cases to proceed. J&J is proposing to pay over $8 billion to settle the claims through a corporate entity it created to absorb the lawsuits and file for bankruptcy. A trial is scheduled for late January to determine whether Judge Lopez will approve J&J\u2019s bankruptcy plan. Th\n\nDecember 2, 2024: Slow Growth in MDL\n\nThe talcum powder MDL added only three new lawsuits in November, marking its slowest month in over a year. The total number of pending cases now stands at 58,201. Lawyers are focused more on settlement of existing claims at this point although our firm is still taking new cases.\n\nNovember 14, 2024: DOJ Pushback\n\nThe Department of Justice, through its bankruptcy monitor, the U.S. Trustee, is objecting to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s choice of Jones Day as counsel for its subsidiary, Red River Talc LLC, in its bankruptcy case. The U.S. Trustee objected, citing a conflict of interest, as Jones Day previously devised the \u201cTexas Two-Step\u201d tactic allowing companies to create a subsidiary burdened with liabilities to file for bankruptcy, shielding parent assets from mass tort claims. It will be interesting to see if a Trump administration will provide similar oversight, given the potential shift in regulatory focus that might deprioritize aggressive intervention in corporate restructuring cases like this one.\n\nOctober 29, 2024: January Hearing on Bankruptcy\n\nIn January 2025, a federal judge in Houston will decide whether to approve J&J\u2019s plan, which aims to resolve these claims efficiently after prior failed bankruptcy attempts in New Jersey. Most plaintiffs are really frustrated at how long this is taking.\n\nOctober 15, 2024: Connecticut Meso Verdict\n\nJohnson & Johnson, along with several subsidiaries, was recently ordered to pay $15 million in damages in a mesothelioma lawsuit involving a real estate developer in Connecticut. The lawsuit held the company accountable for the plaintiff\u2019s asbestos exposure, which led to the mesothelioma diagnosis.\n\nOctober 12, 2024: Connecticut Mesothelioma Trial\n\nThe jury will deliberate in a Connecticut mesothelioma trial involving a Massachusetts real estate developer diagnosed with mesothelioma. His lawyers requested $30 million in damages from Johnson & Johnson; J&J suggested $4 million.\n\nJ&J\u2019s defense denied liability, suggesting that his illness resulted from a genetic mutation rather than asbestos exposure. But J&J\u2019s attorneys argued that if they were found responsible, the number should be more like $4 million. Let me tell you, a defense lawyer that offers a verdict amount in closing statements is a defense lawyer that does not expect to win.\n\nOctober 9, 2024: J&J Bankruptcy to Stay in\n\nA federal judge somehow in Texas somehow ruled that Johnson & Johnson (J&J) did not improperly manipulate bankruptcy laws by filing its insolvency case in Texas instead of its home state, New Jersey. This decision allows J&J to continue its efforts to settle thousands of lawsuits alleging its baby powder caused cancer. J&J has created a new separate bankruptcy subsidiary, Red River Talc, to take on the liability from these lawsuits and then filed for bankruptcy. It is the same old thing, the third time around.\n\nThe ruling is a significant victory for J&J. It wants to get this $8 billion or so settlement done that is said to be supported by around 83% of plaintiffs. This is a win for you if you, too, if you are a victim and just ready to get this over with.\n\nSeptember 30, 2024: U.S. Trustee Accuses J&J Of \u201cForum Shopping\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Trustee is a government official who oversees bankruptcy cases to ensure they are conducted fairly and according to the law, acting as a watchdog against misuse of the bankruptcy system. The Trustee gets involved in any bankruptcy to ensure that the bankruptcy process is fair and transparent. They act as a watchdog to make sure that companies are not using bankruptcy just to escape legal liabilities or unfairly disadvantage creditors.\n\nThe U.S. Trustee for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s third talc bankruptcy has put their thumbs on the scale of the bankruptcy debate. In a motion to transfer the case from the Southern District of Texas to New Jersey, the attorney for the U.S. Trustee accuses J&J of \u201cforum shopping,\u201d or choosing a favorable court, by filing the third bankruptcy in Texas through its subsidiary Red River Talc LLC. The Trustee argues that Red River is essentially the same company as the previous LTL Management, with the same liabilities and assets, and claims that J&J is trying to avoid the unfavorable rulings it received in New Jersey. The U.S. Trustee believes that the case should return to New Jersey to maintain the integrity of the bankruptcy system.\n\nSeptember 25, 2024: Texas Bankruptcy Judge Temporarily Halts Some Lawsuits Against J&J\n\nA Texas bankruptcy judge has temporarily halted some talc lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson to address jurisdictional questions in the Chapter 11 case of its spinoff, Red River Talc LLC.\n\nRed River was created to handle these claims, offering a $9 billion settlement plan to victims. The big issue is whether J&J will be allowed to do this in Texas.\n\nSeptember 23, 2024: J&J Announced Pre-Packaged Plan For $8 Billion Settlement Fund\n\nThis time, as a part of a \u201csort of\u201d agreed upon settlement plant, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talc unit, Red River Talc LLC, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This is the third time J&J has tried the bankruptcy route to resolve its talc-related liability claims.\n\nThe company announced a pre-packaged plan supposedly supported by 83% of current talc injury plaintiffs, proposing an $8 billion settlement fund to cover both current and future ovarian cancer claims. This plan would resolve 99.75% of existing claims, with remaining mesothelioma lawsuits being addressed separately.\n\nSeptember 20, 2024: Vacuum Of Information Surrounding Details Of Settlement Payouts\n\nThe last settlement rumors were $9.1 billion. Now, J&J is leaking the number $8.2 to the media.\n\nPlaintiffs also need more information on how the payouts will work. There is just a vacuum of information on the details.\n\nThis litigation has been a circus on every level.\n\nSeptember 16, 2024: Oregon State Judge Overturns $260 Million Verdict Against J&J\n\nA state judge in Oregon has overturned a $260 million jury verdict against Johnson & Johnson (J&J) in a case involving a woman who claimed she developed mesothelioma, a cancer linked to asbestos exposure, from using the company\u2019s talc powder. The judge granted J&J\u2019s request for a new trial, with a written explanation of the ruling to come. J&J argued that legal errors led to the original verdict, while the plaintiff\u2019s legal team plans to appeal the decision.\n\nSeptember 12, 2024: New Talcum Powder Mesothelioma Trial Underway In Connecticut\n\nA new talc meso trial has begun in Connecticut. A 64-year-old plaintiff diagnosed with mesothelioma sued J&J claiming the disease was caused by his lifetime use of J&J\u2019s talcum powder products. The plaintiff says he used J&J baby powder during childhood to treat rashes and later as an athlete in college.\n\nSeptember 9, 2024: Total Settlement To Reach Over $9 Billion\n\nJ&J reportedly plans to pay an additional $1.1 billion to complete this deal. This would bring the total settlement to over $9 billion\u2026paid out over 25 years.\n\nAugust 22, 2024: J&J Requests Judge Dismiss Proposed Class Action Aimed At Providing Medical Monitoring For Users Of Talc-Based Products\n\nJohnson & Johnson has requested that a federal judge dismiss a proposed national class action aimed at providing medical monitoring for users of its talc-based products.\n\nThe medical monitoring compensation refers to the financial compensation sought to cover the cost of ongoing surveillance and health assessments for individuals who have been exposed to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talc products but may not yet have been diagnosed with a related illness. This type of damage claim is premised on the need for periodic medical evaluations to detect early signs of diseases, such as ovarian or gynecological cancers.\n\nI have mixed feelings about these lawsuits. The actual compensation for individual plaintiffs is small and it takes the focus off victims who have suffered real injury from this product.\n\nAugust 16, 2024: South Carolina Jury Awards $63 Million To Terminal Lung Cancer Patient\n\nIt is hard to imagine the thinking that lets these mesothelioma lawsuits go to trial. Why J&J does not make sure it settles them all is beyond me.\n\nIn another case in point, a South Carolina jury awarded over $63 million to Michael Perry, a cancer patient who developed terminal lung cancer, specifically mesothelioma, from inhaling asbestos in J&J\u2019s talc-based baby powder. The verdict found both Johnson & Johnson and American International Industries (AII) negligent, attributing their products as the proximate cause of Perry\u2019s condition.\n\nWhile J&J was cleared of fraudulent misrepresentation, AII was found culpable. The jury determined their actions as \u201cwillful, wanton, or reckless,\u201d awarding Perry economic and other damages exceeding $23 million, and his spouse, Lonnie Long, received over $9.6 million for loss of consortium. Additionally, punitive damages amounted to $30 million against J&J and $760,000 against AII, totaling $63.4 million owed to Perry and Long.\n\nAugust 12, 2024: Early Rumors Suggest More Than 75% Of Claimants Voted In Favor Of Settlement Plan\n\nAt the end of July, the talc claimants voted to approve the latest settlement plan. Although the official results of that vote have not yet been released, the early rumors are that more than the required 75% of claimants voted in favor of the plan.\n\nJuly 26, 2024: 3rd Circuit Upholds Dismissal Order Stating J&J Subsidiary Bankruptcy Was Not Made In Good Faith\n\nThe talc powder bankruptcy is as foolish as I have been telling you, the 3rd Circuit said yesterday. It upheld the dismissal order stating that LTL Management, a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary set up to take all of the talc liability, was not financially distressed, and thus, its bankruptcy filing was not made in good faith.\n\nThe court found that the potential for future insolvency does not justify a Chapter 11 filing.\n\nJ&J wants to appeal to the Supreme Court. Give me a break already.\n\nJuly 25, 2024: Voting On Proposed Settlement Plan Ends Tomorrow Afternoon\n\nClaimants must vote to accept or reject the settlement plan by 4:00 p.m. (Central Time) tomorrow. Information on voting is provided in a solicitation package sent to claimants or their attorneys.\n\nThe plan commits J&J and its make-believe companies to pay ovarian cancer claimants a present value of approximately $6.475 billion over 25 years, creating a multi-billion-dollar trust to compensate current and future talc claims related to ovarian cancer.\n\nBecause this whole thing is so convoluted if accepted by at least 75% of voters, the plan will lead to a bankruptcy filing under the case name \u201cIn re: Red River Talc LLC\u201d in bankruptcy court. A hearing would be scheduled to confirm the plan, with further notifications issued if the court sets an objection deadline.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the vote plays out. My assumption is that many plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers changed gears over time and that more will recommend their clients take the settlement. But it remains to be seen.\n\nJuly 9, 2024: New Study From WHO Finds Exposure To J&J Talcum Power Increases Risk Of Cancer\n\nThe house of cards J&J has built to argue its talc powder did not cause cancer is collapsing. Exposure to talc in Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder is likely to increase the risk of cancer, particularly ovarian cancer, according to a recent assessment by the World Health Organization.\n\nThis litigation started with people dismissing the connection between talc and baby powder as the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers\u2019 manufactured tale. It will end with it being a pretty much-accepted fact.\n\nJuly 3, 2024: Claimants To Vote On Proposed $6.5 Billion Settlement To Resolve Talcum Power Lawsuits\n\nA big decision is coming up on settlement in these lawsuits. J&J proposed a $6.5 billion settlement to resolve baby powder ovarian cancer lawsuits, contingent on a supermajority agreement (75%) from claimants at the end of this month. This is a big deal.\n\nMedia coverage has been more focused on J&J\u2019s legal dispute with a firm involved in long-standing talcum powder mass tort litigation. J&J wants to disqualify the firm from the litigation, alleging many ethical violations they seem to be bringing out of pure spite, just like the failed lawsuit it brought against a plaintiff\u2019s expert we discussed yesterday.\n\nWe are getting closer to the end. The focus should turn to what really matters: getting these women compensated for the harm done to them.\n\nJuly 2, 2024: J&J\u2019s Lawsuit Against Expert Witness Fails\n\nJ&J\u2019s plan to gain an advantage in the talc litigation by filing frivolous lawsuits against the plaintiffs\u2019 experts failed as expected yesterday. It lost its case against a prominent doctor, Jacqueline Moline, whom it accused of not disclosing alternative asbestos exposure evidence and making false statements regarding J&J\u2019s baby powder.\n\nThis doomed-to-fail-but-sure-to-harass lawsuit centered around a 2019 article by Moline stating that 33 plaintiffs who used J&J talc products and developed mesothelioma had no other potential exposures to asbestos.\n\nThe New Jersey federal court judge ruled that Moline\u2019s statements are protected by the First Amendment.\n\nJune 30, 2024: Court Expected To Allow J&J To Settle In Bankruptcy\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s love affair with bankruptcy court continues, and it looks like the court will allow J&J to settle these claims in bankruptcy if the deal works out.\n\nOn Friday, the MDL judge denied the claimants\u2019 motion \u2013 should say for some claimants, not others \u2013 for a temporary restraining order, stating that they failed to demonstrate actual harm that would justify an injunction.\n\nThe judge dismissed the argument that the settlement proposal would improperly limit the funds available to claimants, finding the claimants\u2019 concerns about future harm speculative and insufficient for a preliminary injunction. He noted that the alleged harm depended on future events that might never happen.\n\nSo the stage is set for the settlement vote at the end of the month.\n\nJune 26, 2024: Expected Results Of Proposed Settlement Package\n\nI\u2019ve been going back and forth on my predictions on whether this talc powder settlement goes through. I\u2019m certainly leaning towards thinking the settlement will be completed from talking to people over the last few weeks. It is by no means a done deal, however. There are still pockets of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers who are dead set against it and will have their clients vote that way next month.\n\nJune 13, 2024: Plaintiff\u2019s Lawyers Split On Stance Towards J&J\u2019s Settlement Offer\n\nWhere are we on the talc powder settlement? Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are split on whether to recommend J&J\u2019s settlement offer to their clients. In terms of which way the wind is blowing today, it is toward settlement.\n\nJune 10, 2024: J&J Reaches $700 Million Settlement With 43 States And DC\n\nJ&J reached a $700 million settlement with 43 states and the District of Columbia over the marketing of its talcum powder and agreed to stop marketing and manufacturing baby powder with talc. J&J is clearly looking to put talc powder-related litigation in its rearview mirror.\n\nJune 7, 2024: New Talcum Power Cancer Trail Underway In Texas\n\nA new talcum powder cancer trial against J&J got underway this week in Dallas, Texas. Opening statements were presented on Wednesday, and the trial is expected to take two to three weeks to complete. This is the first talc trial we have seen in a while, and it is the first in Texas. [Update: this case settled.]\n\nJune 4, 2024: Oregon Jury Orders $260 Million Verdict\n\nJohnson & Johnson keeps letting asbestos lawsuit go to trial. It never works. The latest message to them was sent by an Oregon jury that ordered the company to pay $260 million to a woman who attributed her cancer to the lifelong use of the company\u2019s baby powder. The jury found J&J liable for Kyung Lee\u2019s mesothelioma and awarded her $200 million in compensatory damages along with $60 million in punitive damages. Lee, diagnosed with cancer last year at age 48, argued that the talc-based baby powder contained asbestos.\n\nMay 21, 2024: New Journal Of Clinical Oncology Research Favors Talcum Powder Plaintiffs\n\nNew research published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology supports over 50,000 lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson, claiming that its talc-based baby powder causes ovarian cancer. The study, conducted by researchers from the National Institutes of Health, found a significant association between genital application of talc powder and ovarian cancer, especially with frequent or long-term use.\n\nThese findings are a death knell to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s defense that its talc products are safe and asbestos-free. It also has the potential to stop this talc powder settlement going through.\n\nMay 1, 2024: J&J Agrees To $6.5 Billion Global Settlement Through Subsidiary\u2019s Bankruptcy\n\nThis morning, it was announced that J&J (through its talcum spinoff subsidiary) has agreed to a $6.5 billion global settlement deal to resolve the majority of the talcum powder ovarian cancer claims.\n\nAs part of the deal, the talcum plaintiffs will allow J&J\u2019s subsidiary to file a third bankruptcy proceeding. The prior two bankruptcies faced strong opposition by the talc plaintiffs and were eventually dismissed. This settlement deal only covers the talcum powder claims involving ovarian cancer. J&J has already settled 95% of the talcum powder claims involving mesothelioma. Will the plaintiffs approve the deal? The vote is on July 26, 2024.\n\nApril 30, 2024: Plaintiffs\u2019 Attorneys Contest MDL Judge\u2019s Mandate For Full Refilling Of Daubert Motions\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 attorneys representing clients in the talc powder litigation are contesting the MDL judge\u2019s mandate for a full refiling of Daubert motions. They argue that this requirement, issued without an accompanying detailed opinion or legal rationale, is unwarranted and lacks support from legal precedent.\n\nThe lawyers assert that the justifications provided for this directive\u2014recent amendments to Federal Rule of Evidence 702, emergent scientific insights, and the language used in a previous Daubert opinion by Chief Judge Wolfson\u2014do not sufficiently substantiate the need for such a comprehensive procedural measure, especially since it was not solicited by any involved party nor was it subject to prior discussion. They correctly contend that changes to Rule 702 are unlikely to affect the ruling in this case. These prior decisions have stood unchallenged upon appeal, thereby affirming their appropriateness, and diminishing the justification for a total refiling.\n\nWhat is the point of all this? Would this new judge really flip Judge Woflson\u2019s ruling even though it would likely get overturned by the appeals court? I think putting some fear in plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers \u2013 oh, no, would he really do this? \u2013 might be an intentional strategy to pressure plaintiffs into settling.\n\nApril 22, 2024: J&J Ordered To Pay $45 Million To Family Of Illinois Woman Who Died From Mesothelioma\n\nJohnson & Johnson and its spinoff Kenvue Inc. were ordered to pay $45 million to the family of Theresa Garcia, an Illinois woman who died in 2020 from mesothelioma, a cancer linked to asbestos exposure. Jurors in Chicago found Kenvue 70% responsible for Garcia\u2019s death, attributing the remaining 30% to J&J. The family alleged the companies knew their talcum-based baby powder was contaminated with asbestos. This case marks one of the first significant verdicts against J&J and its affiliates since a judge dismissed a bankruptcy filing by a J&J unit last year, intended to settle ongoing talc cases.\n\nThis is a great win and takes some of the pain out of the verdict in Florida last week.\n\nApril 18, 2024: Florida Jury Rules J&J Was Not Responsible For Ovarian Cancer Of Sarasota County Woman\n\nTough loss today. A Florida state court jury ruled that Johnson & Johnson\u2019s baby powder talc product was not responsible for the ovarian cancer that led to the death of a Sarasota County woman. Her family\u2019s lawsuit claimed that she used the powder daily from 1965 until her cancer diagnosis in 2016.\n\nApril 2, 2024: New Talcum Powder Lawsuit Underway In Florida\n\nIn Sarasota, Florida, a new talc powder lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson is underway. This is a wrongful death claim brought by the widower of a woman who used J&J\u2019s baby powder for decades and later died from ovarian cancer.\n\nThis is the second post-bankruptcy ovarian cancer trial. The first case, as we detail in updates below, starting with the February 14th update, was declared due to a deadlocked Miami jury over the causal link between J&J\u2019s baby powder and the death of an anesthesiologist.\n\nMarch 27, 2024: MDL Judge Orders Complete Resubmission Of Daubert Motions\n\nMDL Judge Michael A. Shipp has determined that updates to Federal Rule of Evidence 702, new scientific developments, and the considerations highlighted in Chief Judge Wolfson\u2019s prior Daubert Opinion justify a complete re-submission of Daubert motions. As a result, parties are directed to file their Daubert motions by July 23, 2024, with any counterarguments to be submitted by August 22, 2024. The court will not, for reasons unclear, allow any reply submissions.\n\nIf Judge Shipp were to reverse the previous order from 2020 or Daubert, the chances of prevailing on appeal would be very high. But that would drag this litigation on even further.\n\nIt is hard to make sense of this ruling. This is hardly a case where the slight Rule 702 changes should change things one iota. Is this to pressure plaintiffs into a settlement? That is the only reason that comes to mind.\n\nMarch 19, 2024: Plaintiff\u2019s Lawyers Fight J&J\u2019s Efforts To Quash Subpoena Served On PwC\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are fighting J&J\u2019s efforts to quash a subpoena served on PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC). The subpoena seeks all communications related to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s contingent liability for its talcum powder products, specifically concerning the process of removing said liability from its balance sheets. J&J challenged the subpoena\u2019s relevance and argued that the requested communications are protected under the attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine.\n\nBut plaintiffs argue these objections by asserting the relevance of the requested information, particularly in light of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s public threats to file a third bankruptcy case to resolve its talcum powder lawsuits, which could bring ongoing litigation to a standstill. Victim\u2019s talc attorneys argue that the information sought is crucial to understanding the defendants\u2019 ability to resolve talc liabilities. It is similar to information previously sought by the defendants in related subpoenas.\n\nMarch 6, 2024: Florida State Judge Declares Mistrial After Jurors\u2019 Deadlock\n\nA Florida state judge declared a mistrial after jurors couldn\u2019t reach a verdict on whether Johnson & Johnson\u2019s baby powder caused the cancer that killed a Miami anesthesiologist. The jury twice told the court they were deadlocked \u2013 \u201chopelessly deadlocked\u201d after a day and a half of deliberations.\n\nThe deceased\u2019s widower \u2013 a well-known Miami lawyer \u2013 argued that the baby powder caused his wife\u2019s cancer. The plaintiff used the powder for decades before being diagnosed with cancer in 2016 and died in 2019. He asked for $14 million in damages.\n\nMarch 1, 2024: Chief Medical Officer Of J&J Claims No Evidence Linking Talcum Powder To Ovarian Cancer\n\nThe Miami ovarian cancer talc powder trial is now in the defense case. (See the February 14 update below.) Dr. Edwin Kuffner, the Chief Medical Officer of Johnson & Johnson, told the jury that an extensive examination of scientific studies by his department revealed no evidence linking the use of baby powder to ovarian cancer.\n\nHe said J&J would not have issued a warning but would have immediately removed it from the market if any evidence of such a link had been discovered. Of course, J&J did pull talc powder off the market in 2020 for a \u201cbusiness reason.\u201d The business reason was that many people disagreed with Dr. Kuffner.\n\nFebruary 14, 2024: New Talcum Powder Trial Unfolds In Miami\n\nJ&J surprised me by letting another case go to trial: In a new trial unfolding in Miami, a jury heard allegations that J&J has been aware for decades that its baby powder could potentially cause cancer. The lawsuit \u2013 filed by the surviving spouse, a Miami lawyer \u2013 aims to hold the company responsible for the 2019 death of an anesthesiologist who used talcum powder daily over 50 years.\n\nFebruary 10, 2024: New MDL Deadlines\n\nNew deadlines in the MDL:\n\nAction Deadline Completion of Plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness depositions April 9, 2024 Defendants\u2019 designation and report service of all experts May 21, 2024 Completion of Defendants\u2019 expert witness depositions July 2, 2024 Filing of Dispositive motions, including Daubert motions July 23, 2024 Filing of Oppositions to Dispositive/Daubert motions August 22, 2024 Filing of Replies in support of Dispositive/Daubert motions September 12, 2024\n\nSo we are looking at the end of the year at best for the subsequent talc powder trial in the MDL.\n\nFebruary 5, 2024: J&J Continues To Go After Experts And Lawyers\n\nJ&J continues to try to attack plaintiffs\u2019 experts and lawyers. It will stop at nothing, and it will still fail.\n\nThe company is issuing new subpoenas to challenge the plaintiffs\u2019 preparations. One subpoena targets Northwell Health Inc., seeking research participant names from Dr. Jacqueline Moline\u2019s studies that link cosmetic talcum powder use to mesothelioma, despite her research focusing on a different type of cancer than the ovarian cancer claims in the litigation.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has also subpoenaed KCIC, a products liability consultant, in a goofy effort to disqualify a plaintiffs\u2019 attorney and his firm from leading the litigation.\n\nJanuary 23, 2024: J&J Offers $6.9 Billion Settlement\n\nJ&J has offered $6.9 billion to settle more than 50,000 ovarian cancer claims. So the average talc settlement under this proposal would be around $130,000.\n\nWait, wasn\u2019t the offer just $8.9 billion? It was. But J&J is handling the mesothelioma cancer claims separately now.\n\nEveryone knows J&J needs to pay more. The question is how much more they will pay and how long it will take for the talc powder lawsuits to settle.\n\nJanuary 11, 2024: J&J Agrees To $700 Million Settlement In Lawsuits Regarding Deceptive Marketing Tactics\n\nJohnson & Johnson has agreed to a $700 million settlement in talc powder lawsuits from numerous U.S. states regarding the company\u2019s deceptive marketing tactics.\n\nThe gist of the lawsuit was that Johnson & Johnson failed to reveal asbestos contamination in its talcum powder products \u2013 a factor increasing the risk of ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. This agreement, involving over 40 states, will settle all existing and potential state-level lawsuits accusing the company of hiding or not disclosing the cancer risks associated with its talcum powder products.\n\nWhat does this news mean to you if you are one of the 50,000 talc powder victims who have filed a lawsuit? That\u2019s a good question. Our lawyers think this is good news for you because it clears out distractions. We need everyone\u2019s attention focused on reaching a global talc powder settlement in 2024. This helps.\n\nJanuary 3, 2024: J&J Investors File Class Action Against The Company\n\nJ&J investors have filed a class action lawsuit that echoes the personal injury and wrongful death plaintiffs in the talc baby powder class action lawsuit. A federal court judge in New Jersey has certified the class action.\n\nWhat is the gist of this new class action? The lawsuit also contends that Johnson & Johnson made misleading statements regarding its product safety and research commitments. Specifically, the investors claim that while the company publicly touted the safety of its talc products, it was internally aware of concerns raised by an external laboratory about the inadequacy of testing methods for detecting asbestos in its products.\n\nLatest News on J&J Talcum Powder Lawsuit in 2023\n\nDecember 23, 2023: Update On J&J\u2019s Allegations Of Lawyer\u2019s Unethical Conduct\n\nAs we told you on Tuesday, J&J filed a motion that alleged that a plaintiffs\u2019 talc powder law firm formed an inappropriate relationship with a former attorney who had worked with J&J, accusing them of using confidential information for their advantage. This former attorney, after leaving his previous firm, was alleged to have collaborated with the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney in the talc litigation, which would be unethical.\n\nThe law firm responded yesterday, refuting claims of acquiring privileged information. They argued that J&J\u2019s motion was an attempt to deflect from its own failures in addressing talc injury claims. Well, we all know there is ample evidence of this.\n\nIs any of this important to you? Not really. We are just keeping you on a minor issue during a quiet time in the talc litigation after a number of settlements and the holidays on deck. Hopefully, as we head in 2024, our updates will be more about the path to a global talc powder settlement that finally compensates all victims.\n\nDecember 19, 2023: J&J Seeks To Disqualify Plaintiff Attorney And Law Firm From Talcum Powder MDL\n\nJohnson & Johnson (J&J) seeks to disqualify a plaintiffs\u2019 attorney and their law firm from the talcum powder multidistrict litigation. J&J cites concerns over the attorney\u2019s recent partnership with a former lawyer who previously worked on the opposite side of the talcum powder litigation. Together, they are involved in negotiating a $19 billion settlement for ovarian cancer cases related to J&J\u2019s talcum powder products. J&J argues that this partnership poses a conflict of interest and potential exposure to confidential information. This dispute revolves around the resolution of numerous talcum powder cases.\n\nDecember 8, 2023: Interesting Bloomberg Article Surrounding Attorney Who Proposed $19 Billion Settlement\n\nBloomberg has an interesting article about an attorney who has proposed a $19 billion settlement for all present and future talc powder lawsuits.\n\nThe lawyer\u2019s plan is for his company would buy J&J units to deal with the talc cases and figure out how to divide up the settlement proceeds. The lawyer used to defend baby powder lawsuits for J&J, who is renouncing the plan. The conflicts of interest, the idea of a company getting paid to take on the sole responsibility for settlement\u2026 the whole thing is convoluted.\n\nStill, the article is interesting for two reasons. First, $19 billion is a concrete number that would seemingly lead to a talc powder lawsuit settlement average of $200,000. You always pay attention when you see numbers and can roughly equate them to average settlement payouts.\n\nThe suggestion that a settlement that covers future payments is interesting. That is the problem for J&J, right? These claims will continue to go on even if there is a global settlement of the 50,000 claims against it. Estimating the number of future claims and their potential costs would be extremely difficult and potentially wildly unfair to future plaintiffs.\n\nThe question most victims have now is how long it will take for the talc powder lawsuit to settle. The real truth is that if plaintiffs want to hold out for $19 billion \u2013 and it is not an unreasonable position \u2013 it will take a lot more time, and it is unlikely that a deal will get done in 2024. The more likely scenario is a settlement in 2024 that is between $8.9 billion and $19 billion\n\nDecember 5, 2023: J&J Seeks To Settle Lawsuits Regarding Asbestos Related Cancer\n\nJohnson & Johnson is actively seeking to settle a number of lawsuits claiming that its talc-based Baby Powder is linked to cancer caused by asbestos. This move is intended to circumvent upcoming jury trials in 2024. These are tough cases of J&J, and the company now finally seems to accept that it needs to pay a lot of money to resolve these asbestos lawsuits.\n\nThis effort is aimed at avoiding jury trials scheduled for next year. There are a lot of trials scheduled. Of course, J&J is looking down the barrel of more than just asbestos claims. The company faces over 50,000 talc powder lawsuits, almost all alleging their ovarian cancer was caused by the use of baby powder. J&J still dreams of a third bankruptcy filing to comprehensively resolve the talc litigation. It will not work.\n\nNovember 17, 2023: J&J Settles Two Talcum Powder Trials For Confidential Amounts\n\nJ&J has wisely decided to catch its breath and settle two talc trials heading for trial. The first case was settled in the middle of trial on Wednesday. A second case settled after a jury was picked. A third lawsuit scheduled in Seattle has been postponed to February 2024.\n\nHow much were these talc powder settlements? As you probably guessed, the settlement amounts are confidential.\n\nNovember 7, 2023: J&J Seeks Third Attempt At Filing Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\n\nJ&J is making rumblings about a third attempt at filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for its LTL unit as a strategy to resolve lawsuits claiming its talc products cause cancer. Having failed twice in New Jersey courts due to the Third Circuit\u2019s ruling that the LTL unit lacked immediate financial distress and could not file in good faith, J&J is contemplating filing in the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Southern District of Texas because they think this forum might be more favorable.\n\nSneak preview of the outcome: it does not work, and J&J wastes even more money.\n\nNovember 1, 2023: MDL Judge Seeks To Get Litigation Back On Track With New Scheduling Order\n\nForward progress in the talcum powder class action MDL has been stalled for nearly two years due to J&J\u2019s two failed efforts to pull the litigation into bankruptcy. Now that this delay is finally over (for now at least), the MDL judge recently sought to get things back on track by issuing a new scheduling order for six cases previously selected for bellwether trials. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that they developed cancer from asbestos in the J&J talc product Shower-to-Shower.\n\nOctober 3, 2023: Appeals Court Nullifies $233 Million Jury Award\n\nJ&J got a win yesterday when an appeals court nullified a $223 million jury award to baby powder users who attributed their cancer to asbestos in the product. The court determined that improper scientific testimony had swayed the original decision. This case will get tried again, and the verdict may be even higher.\n\nSeptember 21, 2023: New MDL Judge Signals Need For Another Science Day\n\nNew MDL judge means another Science Day. What is a Science Day? The primary purpose of a Science Day is to provide the judge with a comprehensive understanding of the scientific, medical, and technical issues central to the litigation.\n\nThis is especially important in cases like the talc lawsuits, where the underlying facts and scientific evidence are complex and may significantly impact the outcome of the cases.\n\nBoth parties, plaintiffs and defendants, are usually allowed to make presentations. These presentations may include expert witnesses, scientific studies, research findings, and other evidence related to the case. The presentations aim to clarify complex scientific concepts and give the judge a balanced view of the scientific evidence.\n\nScience Days are supposed to be non-adversarial in nature. The goal is to educate the judge rather than argue the case. Of course, lawyers are always trying to advance the interests of their clients. So it is subtle adversarial. This event is anticipated to take place in either November or December\n\nSeptember 1, 2023: J&J Continues To Delay Litigation\n\nJ&J has delay tactics down to an art form. The latest? J&J wants to reargue expert witness challenges that were already decided by the previous MDL judge, who has since retired. It is a silly argument and likely to go nowhere. But it costs everyone time.\n\nAugust 14, 2023: New Jersey Bankruptcy Judge Dismisses J&J\u2019s Subsidiary Bankruptcy Case\n\nOn Friday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan in Trenton, New Jersey, officially dismissed Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talc subsidiary\u2019s second bankruptcy case.\n\nBut as our August 3rd update below foreshadowed, the judge did not accede to the request of plaintiffs\u2019 talc powder lawyers for a six-month prohibition on future bankruptcy filings by the company.\n\nSo presumably, J&J can file for bankruptcy a third time, which is completely insane. But J&J may not even try at this point.\n\nAugust 15, 2023: J&J Will Not Be Barred From Attempting Third Bankruptcy Filing\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan ruled this week that J&J and its talcum powder subsidiary, LTL Management, will not be barred from attempting a third bankruptcy filing. After the second LTL bankruptcy filing was rejected earlier this month, lawyers for the talcum plaintiffs asked the Judge to issue an order preventing J&J and LTL from filing any more bankruptcies for the next 6-months. That request was denied. J&J has not commented on whether it intends to file again.\n\nAugust 4, 2023: Judge Dismisses Motion To Bar Attorney From Acting As Representative For Future Meso Claims\n\nThe New Jersey bankruptcy judge overseeing Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Chapter 11 efforts to resolve talc claims dismissed a motion by a law firm to bar attorney Randi S. Ellis from acting as the representative for future mesothelioma claims, sharply stating that the request \u201clacks any legal or factual basis.\u201d\n\nAugust 1, 2023: J&J Expected To Pivot Strategy\n\nAfter its second bankruptcy application was dismissed, J&J is starting to realize bankruptcy is not a path and is assessing other legal options to address the thousands of cancer claims linked to its talc-based products. So what is the plan? Possible courses of action include settling individual claims, negotiating with law firms representing plaintiffs, or pursuing a global settlement. A global settlement would really be hard to pull off, and J&J knows there are likely law firms out there who are willing to take smaller settlement amounts to get this done now. Our lawyers think the most likely scenario is that J&J looks to settle cases with individual law firms. Cutting back on the number of claims would be a relief for J&J stockholders.\n\nJuly 29, 2023: J&J\u2019s Second Attempt At Chapter 11 Dismissed\n\nBig news yesterday. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talc unit\u2019s second attempt to address thousands of talc injury claims through Chapter 11 bankruptcy was dismissed by a New Jersey bankruptcy judge.\n\nThe judge ruled that the company did not meet the standards for financial distress required for the bankruptcy case to proceed. The first Chapter 11 filing of J&J\u2019s subsidiary debtor, LTL Management LLC, was also dismissed on the same financial distress grounds in a January ruling by the Second Circuit.\n\nThis gives the plaintiffs more leverage in settlement negotiations. J&J just needs to put up more billions. It is as simple as that.\n\nJuly 21, 2023: J&J Proposed Global Settlement Of $8.9 Billion\n\nJ&J recently proposed a global settlement of the talcum powder lawsuits for a total payout of $8.9 billion. That proposal currently has the support of a large segment of talc plaintiffs and their lawyers, pushing other plaintiffs to sign off also.\n\nThe $18.8 million awarded in the California talc trial earlier this week could undermine the push to win approval of the $8.9 settlement deal. Why? Because victims are more likely to seek just compensation \u2013 which our lawyers do not think this deal does \u2013 when they see a significant verdict. The verdict marks yet another big win for a talc plaintiff at trial, and it will likely reinforce the view held by many plaintiffs that $8.9 billion is a lowball offer for the resolution of nearly 38,000 claims.\n\nJuly 19, 2023: California Jury Awards $18.8 Million In Damages\n\nEarlier this week, a jury in California awarded $18.8 million in damages to a 24-year-old man who claimed that his long-time use of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder caused him to develop a deadly mesothelioma cancer. This marks the verdict in a talcum powder case since J&J tried to spin its talc liabilities off into bankruptcy.\n\nJuly 16, 2023: Law Firm Requests Disqualification Of Attorney From Representing Future Claimants\n\nA law firm representing mesothelioma patients has requested the disqualification of attorney Randi S. Ellis from representing future claimants in the bankruptcy case of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talc liability unit. Ms. Ellis makes $1,015 an hour representing the interests of potential victims who have not yet brought a claim.\n\nThe request is based on allegations that Ellis was photographed having a meal \u2013 a stake dinner, apparently \u2013 with J&J\u2019s chief negotiator and two ad hoc committee members supporting the bankruptcy plan. The law firm argues this raises concerns about impropriety and Ellis\u2019 ability to fulfill her fiduciary duties.\n\nJuly 11, 2023: Closing Statements Completed In California\u2019s Baby Powder Lawsuit\n\nClosing statements are completed in California\u2019s baby powder asbestos lawsuit. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney argues that J&J ignored medical data as early as 1998, when the plaintiff was born, showing a potential threat of asbestos in its talc products. They argue that J&J\u2019s failure to act at that point led to Hernandez\u2019s exposure and eventual illness. The plaintiff is seeking between $40 million and $50 million in compensatory damages plus another $450 million in punitive damages. Outlandish damages in many cases. Not this one.\n\nJuly 10, 2023: J&J Subsidiary Lodged Lawsuit Against Three Doctors\n\nLTL Management LLC, a bankrupt talc unit of Johnson & Johnson, has lodged a lawsuit against three doctors \u2013 plaintiff\u2019s experts in talc lawsuits \u2013 claiming they hurt its business by publishing articles asserting a connection between talc use and mesothelioma, using what LTL refers to as \u201cjunk science.\u201d\n\nThis follows a similar pattern of lawsuits by LTL in its initial bankruptcy proceedings, all dismissed following the dismissal of the bankruptcy itself. LTL was established to manage the influx of claims against J&J\u2019s talc products, believed to contain asbestos and linked to diseases such as ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.\n\nJ&J is sending a message to plaintiffs\u2019 experts everywhere it will sue if it does not like your scientific conclusions. The unfortunate thing is these doctors have to mount a legal defense, which means they lose even when they ultimately win. But the bigger problem is the chilling effect J&J seems to be looking for that tells doctors to tread lightly when taking positions big companies will not like. We all have an interest in as much science as possible coming to the marketplace of ideas.\n\nJune 28, 2023: J&J\u2019s Talc Unit Goes To Trial On Motions To Dismiss Chapter 11 Case\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s bankrupt talc unit recently went to trial on motions to dismiss its Chapter 11 case. During the trial, executives of the unit testified about the financial support provided by J&J.\n\nThe unit signed a new funding agreement with J&J because the first agreement was no longer enforceable. The new funding agreement provides financial support for an $8.9 billion settlement proposal. This is a little like asking the barber how often you should get a haircut. If we continue with jury trials, the real liability risk is more than double that settlement offer.\n\nThe trial is ongoing, and it is unclear whether the court will dismiss the case. It should. The 3rd Circuit was clear this is not a proper use of bankruptcy, no matter how J&J keeps repackaging it.\n\nJune 27, 2023: California Mesothelioma Plaintiff Provides Testimony On Consequences Of Cancer Diagnosis\n\nIn the ongoing Alameda County, California J&J baby powder mesothelioma trial, the plaintiff provided poignant testimony about the horrific consequences of his cancer diagnosis, which he attributes to his lifelong use of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (JNJ.N) baby powder. The 24-year-old emotionally conveyed to the jury of the unimaginable horror of being diagnosed with mesothelioma at such a young age. Regardless of where you stand on the case\u2019s merits, what this man has endured is genuinely awful. His critical point is that if he had known the risks of using talc powder, he would not have used it.\n\nPlaintiffs have established strong scientific evidence of the link between mesothelioma and talc powder. J&J will now have its chance to put on its case. This is a tough case for J&J and such a crucial juncture in this litigation. It is hard to understand why they have not made a reasonable settlement offer in this case given the implications on its $8.9 billion settlement offer.\n\nJune 14, 2023: New Jersey Bankruptcy Judge Postpones Key Decisions\n\nA New Jersey bankruptcy judge postponed key decisions in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s bankrupt talc subsidiary, LTL Management LLC\u2019s Chapter 11 case. The judge awaits an upcoming trial before ruling on ending LTL\u2019s exclusive right to propose a Chapter 11 plan. After their first case was dismissed, LTL refiled for Chapter 11, proposing an $8.9 billion settlement fund for cancer and mesothelioma claimants alleging asbestos exposure from talc products that we think is unlikely to get approval from enough victims. The hope is that Judge Kaplan follows the spirit of the 3rd Circuit\u2019s opinion and dismisses the bankruptcy, which is exactly what just happened in the 3M MDL when 3M tried the same stunt.\n\nJune 2, 2023: Technical Glitches Interrupt Opening Statements In Asbestos Talc Trial\n\nDuring the asbestos talc trial in California yesterday, some technical glitches interrupted the opening statement by the defense attorneys. The jurors, attending from home on Zoom, did hear Johnson & Johnson\u2019s lawyer expressing skepticism about the 70s science asserting the presence of asbestos in their product before the opening was abruptly ended.\n\nMeanwhile, the plaintiff was able to present their first witness, Arthur Langer. Langer explained that the occurrence of other minerals alongside talc is inevitable. He testified that his team informed J&J in 1971 about the presence of chrysotile asbestos in the company\u2019s talc, albeit at less than 0.1 percent. He also discovered more asbestos in 1976.\n\nJune 1, 2023: New Mesothelioma Trial Underway\n\nThe first trial since J&J decided to spin off its talc division and declare bankruptcy marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing talc litigation saga. The trial began yesterday in the poignant case of a young 24-year-old plaintiff, diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of mesothelioma last year, a diagnosis lawyers on both sides agree is a grave tragedy.\n\nOpening statements laid bare stark differences in each side\u2019s narrative. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney took aim at Johnson & Johnson, alleging the use of deceptive tactics in research practices and throughout the litigation process. According to the attorney, the company tried to manipulate the definition of asbestos, despite internal documents from 1978 and 1994 showing that fibers discovered in the plaintiff\u2019s tissue were included.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s precarious $8.9 billion settlement offer hangs in the balance with the progression of this trial. Despite the unique nature of this mesothelioma case and its distinct issues compared to most talcum powder lawsuits, a verdict favoring the plaintiff could inflict a serious setback to J&J\u2019s hopes for broad acceptance of their proposed settlement among plaintiffs.\n\nMay 31, 2023: J&J Subsidiary Defends Second Chapter 11 Filing\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s bankrupt talc unit vigorously defended its second Chapter 11 filing in the face of challenges from talc injury claimants. In an objection submitted to the New Jersey bankruptcy court, the subsidiary argued that the case was fundamentally different from the previous filing. It emphasized the unprecedented commitment of $8.9 billion from J&J, the largest settlement ever in a mass tort bankruptcy case. Not mentioned: how the size of the settlement means it is a fair settlement. J&J also claimed support from numerous plaintiffs\u2019 law firms representing over 60,000 claimants. This is hard to verify but likely incorrect.\n\nMay 24, 2023: California Mesothelioma Trial Set To Start Jury Selection\n\nSince Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 2021 bankruptcy filing, the first trial concerning its cosmetic talc products allegedly containing asbestos is set to start jury selection on Monday in California in Alameda County Superior Court, a historically good jurisdiction for plaintiffs. The plaintiff claims that his mesothelioma was caused by asbestos exposure from J&J\u2019s products, an allegation the company denies. The trial also involves six retailers accused of selling talc-containing products.\n\nMay 22, 2023: Future Claims Representative Appointment\n\nLawyers in the 2nd J&J talc bankruptcy are now battling over who should be appointed to the position of future claims representative, a role that is critically important to resolving the talc claims. Randi Ellis, a lawyer who frequently appears in MDLs across the country, was appointed as the claims representative in the first bankruptcy. J&J\u2019s defense team wants Ellis to be appointed to that role again, but lawyers for the talc plaintiffs are objecting on the grounds that Ellis has a conflict of interest that should prevent her from assuming that position again. The conflict stems from the fact that Ellis was apparently involved in drafting the hotly contested second bankruptcy, which raises concerns about her ability to be neutral. The reality is this bankruptcy is likely to get dismissed anyway.\n\nMay 17, 2023: J&J Continues Efforts To Settle Through Bankruptcy\n\nThe pretend company that J&J made up for the talc litigation bankruptcy told a New Jersey bankruptcy court that they have designated $400 million to settle the claims made by states accusing the company of deceptive advertising for its talc products. So that makes it an $8.5 billion settlement for cancer victims. It is hard to imagine a scenario where J&J can push these baby powder settlements through at these numbers. While J&J\u2019s proposed $8.5 billion offer sounds like a lot of money at first, it does not look great when you do the math. This settlement proposal \u2013 by our rough calculations \u2013 would not pay victims much more than an average settlement $100,000 per case. That is not enough.\n\nMay 15, 2023: J&J Faces Potential New Lawsuit From Cancer Victims Advocacy Group\n\nJ&J is potentially facing a lawsuit from an advocacy group representing cancer victims. The group contends that J&J intentionally withdrew a $61.5 billion funding agreement with its subsidiary, LTL Management LLC, to simulate financial distress and validate the unit\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The group asserts this action is equivalent to a fraudulent transfer of the victims\u2019 compensation rights. They plan to explore J&J\u2019s actions in the wake of the dismissal of LTL\u2019s first bankruptcy case.\n\nMay 10, 2023: New Order Requiring Attempt At Settlement Mediation\n\nNext week, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey will hear oral arguments on a motion to dismiss the second bankruptcy filing by J&J subsidiary LTL Management. In the meantime, however, the bankruptcy has issued an Order requiring both sides to take part in a new settlement mediation in the hope that a global settlement deal can brokered.\n\nMay 5, 2023: Talc Suppliers File For Bankruptcy\n\nTalc supplier Whittaker, Clark & Daniels filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to numerous lawsuits alleging its talc products caused cancer from asbestos exposure. Over 2,700 individuals have sued the company, and it was spending $1 million a month on legal defense. The company\u2019s recent $29 million verdict in South Carolina forced it to seek bankruptcy protection, arguing for equitable distribution of assets among talc claimants instead of being seized by the receiver. Other talc suppliers have also filed for bankruptcy due to litigation.\n\nMay 4, 2023: Bankruptcy Judge Directs J&J To Restart Settlement Discussions\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan has directed Johnson & Johnson to restart settlement discussions with lawyers who turned down the company\u2019s proposed $8.9 billion settlement offer. In Trenton, New Jersey yesterday, the parties appeared in court to discuss the next steps for the second bankruptcy case, and Judge Kaplan pushed more settlement talks.\n\nThis is the answer to resolve these claims for J&J. A baby powder settlement can get done. But it will require more money \u2013 more billions of dollars \u2013 from Johnson & Johnson.\n\nLawyers are split on whether to accept the proposal and not every client sees the issue the same way their attorney does. The second bankruptcy case is bound to go nowhere, and Judge Kaplan has scheduled a hearing in June to determine whether to dismiss the bankruptcy for the second time.\n\nMay 1, 2023: Relative Size Of $8.9 Billion Settlement\n\nOne question people keep asking is how could plaintiffs and their lawyers turn down $8.9 billion. Of course, that is a lot of money. But there are a lot of victims. And these are really good cases for plaintiffs. We were reminded of this recently with two talc trials resulting in big verdicts for the plaintiffs. In February, a talcum powder mesothelioma trial in Oregon resulted in a verdict of $18.1 million. A month later, another talc mesothelioma case went to trial in South Carolina and resulted in a verdict of $29 million for the plaintiff. The defendant in both cases was Whittaker, Clark & Daniels Inc., one of the leading suppliers of talc in the U.S.\n\nApril 30, 2023: J&J Increases Offer To $8.9 Billion\n\nWhen J&J initially attempted to pull the talcum powder litigation into bankruptcy, it came with an offer to set aside $2 billion for settlements. The amount was absurdly low. None of the talc plaintiffs supported it. This time around, however, J&J has increased the offer to $8.9 if the talc plaintiffs will allow a bankruptcy settlement and they also have the support of a large segment of the talc plaintiffs and their lawyers. But 75% of the talc plaintiffs, which is required for bankruptcy plan approval, is a tough road with so many lawyers with large inventories of baby powder lawsuits opposed to the settlement.\n\nWhat could solve the impasse? More billions.\n\nApril 25, 2023: Plaintiffs\u2019 Lawyers And Victims Divided Over Settlement Offer\n\nTalc cancer claimants have asked a judge to dismiss the Chapter 11 case filed by LTL Management LLC, a ridiculously made-up Johnson & Johnson subsidiary, saying the company is not financially distressed. LTL filed for Chapter 11 to settle tens of thousands of claims that J&J\u2019s baby powders caused cancer. The 3rd Circuit dismissed its first Chapter 11 case in January, saying the company was not eligible for bankruptcy relief as it failed to show financial distress.\n\nThe claimants argue that LTL\u2019s second Chapter 11 case is an abuse of the bankruptcy system and that it is being pursued in bad faith. J&J claims the bankruptcy settlement has \u201csignificant support\u201d from firms representing an estimated 60,000 claimants. It is fair to say plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and victims are divided over the $8.9 billion settlement offer.\n\nApril 21, 2023: Judge Rules J&J Must Face New Lawsuits\n\nA bankruptcy judge ruled that Johnson & Johnson must face new lawsuits alleging that the company sold tainted baby powder causing cancer. Although trials for talc lawsuits are paused for at least 60 days, new lawsuits can be filed, and lawyers can begin preparing their cases. The judge expressed skepticism over J&J\u2019s ridiculous effort to revive its strategy with a second bankruptcy case.\n\nApril 13, 2023: Split Opinions On How To Respond To $8.9 Billion Offer\n\nThe big news is the $8.9 billion over 25 years settlement offer. Lawyers representing cancer victims in the MDL class action have vowed to fight the settlement with talc claimants. Why? They think it is not enough money for 70,000 victims who have cancer. These lawyers argue that J&J should negotiate a larger settlement or litigate individual claims if the latest bankruptcy is dismissed.\n\nBut there is another group of lawyers outside of the leadership in the class action. These lawyers have collectively amassed tens of thousands of cases. This group wants to settle now for what many argue is less than these victims deserve. Their argument seems to be twofold. First, they argue the settlement \u2013 about an average of $100,000 per plaintiff \u2013 is fair.\n\nThat is a hard argument to make. But their second argument has more teeth: victims can no longer wait and want their money now.\n\nApril 12, 2023: J&J Second Attempt At Bankruptcy Explained\n\nPeople are asking how J&J can file for bankruptcy again. The answer is complex and convoluted. But let\u2019s try to explain it simply.\n\nJohnson & Johnson asserts that bankruptcy is the only means to address both present and future talc lawsuits conclusively. In other words, it thinks it will pay less if there is a bankruptcy component that applies pressure for a settlement. Driving past 400 years of American history, the company argues that bankruptcy benefits all parties by distributing settlement payments more equitably and efficiently than trial courts, where some litigants receive significant awards while others receive nothing.\n\nThe gist of the 3rd Circuit decision was this is not a case \u2013 a profitable company making a subsidiary to take the legal liability and declare bankruptcy \u2013 Congress contemplated when drafting the Bankruptcy Code. But it also said that the subsidiary was not in financial distress because J&J promised unlimited funding.\n\nSo J&J jumped on the unlimited funding part of the holding and did not promise to provide unlimited funding for litigation. The company claims that its revised financing arrangements with its subsidiary address the appeals court\u2019s concerns while still supplying funds for claim payments. As if offering victims less money would solve the overarching problem.\n\nAttorneys representing cancer victims who oppose the agreement counter this with what you conclude is countering legal nonsense with legal nonsense: J&J fraudulently transferred $50 billion in assets away from LTL Management to circumvent the appeals court\u2019s previous ruling. Hyperbole was not spared: victims\u2019 lawyers call it the largest \u201cfraudulent transfer in United States history.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the legal mumbo jumbo, J&J does not really think this bankruptcy will survive. But it is a way of trying to push this $8.9 billion settlement and keep pressure on plaintiffs.\n\nApril 10, 2023: New Bloomberg Article Concerning New Law In New Jersey\n\nBloomberg has an interesting article on a new law in New Jersey that is shedding new light on litigation funding in the baby powder class action lawsuit. Litigation funders Virage Capital Management and TRGP Capital invested in hundreds of claims against Johnson & Johnson (J&J) over talc products in exchange for a portion of any winnings. J&J is now offering to pay $8.9 billion to settle all lawsuits.\n\nThe funders\u2019 involvement is public information due to a New Jersey court rule requiring the disclosure of certain information about outside funding backers. The rule aims to address the growing calls for regulation of litigation funders. J&J faces over 60,000 claims when you add up state and federal baby powder lawsuits. Third-party funding in mass tort claims has pros and cons. But there is no question that we are seeing how third-party funding can level the playing field between individuals and large corporations in court.\n\nApril 4, 2023: Third Circuit Denies J&J\u2019s Request To Continue Automatic Stay\n\nIt is enjoyable to see the worm turn in this litigation. J&J took another hit this week when the Third Circuit denied J&J\u2019s request to continue the automatic stay while J&J appeals a bankruptcy ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. The automatic stay has frozen thousands of talcum powder cases and prevented new lawsuits from getting filed ever since J&J initiated the controversial effort to spin the talc liabilities off into a bankrupt subsidiary over a year ago. When the 3rd Circuit ruled that this bankruptcy was not valid a few months ago, the stay was removed. J&J was hoping to have it continued pending the SCOTUS appeal. But the answer was no.\n\nApril 1, 2023: J&J To Appeal To The Supreme Court\n\nJohnson & Johnson announced it will appeal its 3rd Circuit bankruptcy loss to the U.S. Supreme Court last week. Any chance the Supreme Court is even willing to hear the appeal? Not really.\n\nFebruary 25, 2023: Tennessee Congressman Urges Investigation Into Cost Of J&J Talc Products For U.S. Government\n\nA congressman from Tennessee is now demanding that the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) launch an investigation into how much J&J talc products have cost the government over the years.\n\nIn a recent letter to the GAO, Rep. Steven Cohen (D-Ten.) accused J&J of ignoring the dangers of its talc products for years while tax dollars were spent treating those injured by exposure to the products. The demand comes just weeks after J&J\u2019s significant loss in the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nJ&J needs to start making reasonable settlement offers to victims to begin to put all of this behind it. It is a stain on one of the world\u2019s greatest companies.\n\nFebruary 14, 2023: Bankruptcy Judge Announces Intention To Dismiss J&J Case\n\nAt a hearing today in New Jersey, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan announced his intention in light of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling to dismiss the bankruptcy case.\n\nFebruary 8, 2023: New Judge In Talcum Powder MDL\n\nIn the latest MDL 2738 update, we report a new beginning in the talc powder litigation: a new judge. Following the retirement of Judge Freda L. Wolfson, who had presided over the baby powder litigation, the JPML Panel appointed U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp to preside over the second act of this litigation. It seems fitting to have a new judge as we restart the baby powder class action lawsuit. Judger Wolfson controlled the talc MDL for seven years.\n\nJanuary 31, 2023: Post Concerning 3rd Circuit Baby Powder Bankruptcy Ruling\n\nOur post on the 3rd Circuit baby powder bankruptcy ruling.\n\nJanuary 30, 2023: Third Circuit Rejects J&J\u2019s Attempt At Bankruptcy\n\nThe Third Circuit rejected J&J\u2019s attempt to dump off its mounting talcum powder liability into bankruptcy. In an opinion issued today, the court dismissed the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filed by a subsidiary of J&J created to offload its growing talc liabilities. J&J\u2019s stock dropped 3% on the news, the most significant single-day dip in over two years. J&J has already vowed to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nJanuary 2, 2023: Prediction Concerning 3rd Circuit Court\u2019s Decision On J&J Bankruptcy\n\nLess of an update than a prediction. The 3rd Circuit will reject J&J\u2019s bankruptcy gambit in February. J&J will appeal to the Supreme Court but settle these lawsuits in massive numbers before the claims are resolved. (Arguably, this is more of a hope than a prediction. But we are excited about the possibility of progress in 2023 in this litigation after years of quicksand.)\n\nDecember 25, 2022: 3rd Circuit Oral Arguments\n\nRewatching the 3rd Circuit oral arguments today. It is worth a watch. It is well-argued on both sides, and this is a strong panel of judges. You don\u2019t get the impression that this panel of judges will allow this \u201cbankruptcy to avoid bankruptcy\u201d to stand. But that could be my bias talking.\n\nDecember 22, 2022: Hair Relaxer Lawsuits In Regard To Ovarian Cancer\n\nHair relaxer lawsuits are being filed around the country by women who claim injuries from chemical hair straighteners. One injury that interests women in the talcum powder litigation is relaxer-induced ovarian cancer. There is good science to support these claims.\n\nOctober 1, 2022: New Yorker Article\n\nThis New Yorker article on J&J is a great read.\n\nSeptember 27, 2022: Mediator Told To Report To Judge Before Weather Gets Cold\n\nAlso, the mediator hoping to facilitate a resolution to get settlement payouts to victims was told to report to the judge before \u201cthe weather gets cold.\u201d\n\nI was cold today.\n\nSeptember 20, 2022 Update: Judges\u2019 Skeptical Litigation Advantage Is Not Motivating J&J\n\nYesterday, a 3-judge panel at the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia heard oral arguments in the appeal challenging the validity of J&J\u2019s controversial effort to spin off its talcum powder liabilities into bankruptcy. J&J created a new corporate entity called LTL Management, transferred all the talc liabilities to it, and then LTL promptly filed bankruptcy.\n\nThe issue on appeal is whether this was permissible or whether the bankruptcy spin-off was filed in bad faith and should be dismissed. The panel of judges hit J&J\u2019s attorney with many challenging questions.\n\nOne of those questions was whether the bankruptcy was for an advantage in the litigation. How could J&J lawyers pretend that was not the impetus for the bankruptcy filing? Somehow, they did, arguing that the advantage is a byproduct of a more overarching goal.\n\nThe judges seemed skeptical and raised many mass tort lawyers\u2019 concerns that allowing this bankruptcy would spark a wave of similar bankruptcy filings (like the 3M earplug claims) by financially solvent companies looking to shed litigation liabilities.\n\nThe results of this ruling will have a tangible impact on talcum powder settlement amounts. If the bankruptcy holds, victims will still get settlement compensation payouts. But they are likely to be lower if the risk of colossal jury awards is not hanging over J&J\u2019s head and they can resolve these claims in bankruptcy court.\n\nOur baby powder lawyers are hoping the 3rd Circuit gets this right. The purpose of our bankruptcy laws for a company seeking insolvency \u2013 is to protect creditors. Instead, J&J is trying to use the Bankruptcy Code as a litigation management device for a company worth nearly $500 billion. That cannot be the purpose of bankruptcy.\n\nWhen will J&J Settle the Remaining Talcum Powder Lawsuits?\n\nContact Miller & Zois to File a Talcum Powder Lawsuit\n\nIt is NOT too late to file your talcum powder lawsuit \u2013 at least not for many of you. If you used a talcum powder product for an extended period and were subsequently diagnosed with ovarian cancer, call our talcum powder lawsuit attorneys at 800-553-8082 or contact us online.",

            "content": "Many of us think of a surgical scalpel as a tool with only one function: to cut. Candice Otrembiak\u2019s job is to show that its possibilities are infinite. As a research and development design engineer at Johnson & Johnson MedTech since 2014, Otrembiak uses energy technology\u2014which involves harnessing pressure, heat and time\u2014to create multipurpose surgical instruments.\n\n\n\nThe innovative tools that she\u2019s developed do far more than cut tissue. They can transect vascular structures while also using the building blocks of biological structures\u2014such as collagens, elastins and other proteins in the tissue\u2014to refuse these components in a way that creates a seal to prevent bleeding after the transection has occurred. This allows surgeons to quickly reach and mobilize targeted anatomy while reducing the risk of bleeding.\n\n\n\nOne advanced ultrasonic device that Otrembiak and her team created relies on mechanical energy: Its titanium blade vibrates back and forth extremely quickly\u201455,000 times per second\u2014generating enough heat from friction to seal the tissue. This device is most commonly used in ear, neck and throat procedures as well as in gynecological and general surgery.\n\n\n\nOtrembiak has also worked on advanced bipolar devices, which use electrical energy to heat up tissue while a cutting edge is deployed. These are typically used in laparoscopic surgery, including bariatric, colorectal and gynecological procedures.\n\n\n\nNext-generation instruments like these allow surgeons to work more efficiently, quickly and safely, giving them more options to fit the needs of each patient and procedure. \u201cThey can choose a device that meets their specific needs for the specific procedures within their specialty,\u201d says Otrembiak.\n\n\n\nIt can take years to go from coming up with the idea for a new surgical instrument to making sure it holds up against rigorous testing and is ready to be used in operating rooms across the world. That long timeline doesn\u2019t bother Otrembiak. The end result\u2014delivering a product that enhances health and healing\u2014\u201cis always a very significant moment for me,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nRead on to learn how Otrembiak got her start in medtech engineering, the unmet needs that inspire her creativity and the new device she\u2019s in the early stages of innovating.\n\nQ: Growing up, what were the earliest clues that you would one day be developing medtech tools? A: I\u2019ve always been adventurous and curious and wanting to explore the world, which as a kid was my neighborhood in Kentucky. It was a new development where lots of construction was happening, which fascinated me\u2014I wanted to know how things worked. In school, I loved science classes. I loved asking questions and getting really hands-on, like doing the classic volcano with baking soda and vinegar. I always enjoyed working with my hands, not only from the science perspective but also with art. A natural-born engineer, Otrembiak has always loved working and creating with her hands.\n\nQ: Did a particular person in your life inspire you to go into medtech engineering\u2014like a parent, teacher or mentor? A: I was born an engineer, so no one had to convince me to be one. But my parents were instrumental in recognizing this and knowing what to call the thing I already was. I was lucky enough to have parents who just knew very early on, when I was taking things apart\u2014like my sister\u2019s brand-new sewing machine\u2014and trying to put them back together for fun, \u201cthat\u2019s an engineer.\u201d When I was in high school, they were like, \u201cThis is what you love to do. These are your skills. Here\u2019s the career path that uses all of those things that you already love doing.\u201d\n\nQ: What\u2019s a typical workday for you? A: No two days have ever been the same! I think that speaks to the nature of engineering, at least in medtech research and development. There\u2019s just so much going on, from taking a project from concept to honing out the design to long-term manufacturing. Some days, I\u2019m generating evidence about an unmet need in surgery and coming up with new ideas. Or I\u2019m hands-on in the lab doing mechanical testing or testing on tissue. Other days, I\u2019m in meetings, trying to make decisions about a product with lots of different teams. Sometimes I\u2019m at a hospital watching surgeons as they use a new tool in the operating room, answering questions and troubleshooting any issues.\n\nQ: Do you have a specific area of expertise or type of device you work on? A: During my 10 years with Johnson & Johnson, I\u2019ve specialized in bipolar vessel sealers and ultrasonic vessel sealers for laparoscopic procedures. That\u2019s kind of where I grew up, if you will. But I\u2019ve recently transitioned into supporting some of the stapling technology used in general, thoracic, colorectal and bariatric procedures. That\u2019s been really cool and fun to learn about, especially as a mechanical engineer. I\u2019m currently working on a product for colorectal procedures. Very severe complications can occur during colorectal surgery, and there is still a real need for reducing them. I\u2019m hoping to help with that.\n\nQ: What about your work makes you proudest? A: Seeing a product that I\u2019ve worked on succeed. I want the surgeon and surgical staff to be very happy with it and for everything to go according to plan. My goal is to make devices that get the patient off the table as fast as possible with the surgeon\u2019s utmost confidence. That person has a life to live and a family to go home to, and there\u2019s just nothing like knowing that you aided in that positive outcome.\n\nQ: What\u2019s one thing you want people to know about your work? A: That it takes a long time to launch a product in the medical device space. From the initial conception to the final product launch, it can take three or four years. But there are patients waiting for solutions. Launching these products with utmost confidence that they will improve lives is the number-one goal.\n\nQ: What are your passions or interests outside of your work? A: My wife and I really love traveling. I guess this goes back to my roots and how I love exploring and learning and experiencing new things\u2014including getting lost sometimes in a place that I don\u2019t know. Otrembiak\u2019s curiosity about the world inspired a trip exploring New Zealand. I also have a lot of artistic hobbies: drawing, painting, crafting and creating things. I recently got into laser cutting and engraving, which I like because it blends both engineering and art. I make custom game pieces and tokens and 3D art that you can hang on the wall. I started an Etsy store to sell all the pieces I make.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nJohnson & Johnson said Friday it has resumed the use of its Varipulse pulsed field ablation (PFA) device in the U.S. after finding the technology works as intended.\n\nThe company paused cases in January, two months after winning approval in the U.S., to review four reported neurovascular events. J&J found the devices operate as intended but the risk of neurovascular events may increase in certain circumstances.\n\nWith J&J updating its instructions for use to reflect the risk, J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note to investors that Boston Scientific\u2019s and Medtronic\u2019s rival PFA devices have cleaner labels with less restrictive language. The analysts expect Boston Scientific to benefit from J&J\u2019s challenges.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nJ&J in November became the third device maker to win Food and Drug Administration approval for a PFA system, positioning the company to market Varipulse as a treatment for atrial fibrillation. The company had completed more than 130 cases across 14 sites by early January but then paused the rollout in response to neurovascular events. J&J continued the overseas rollout, where the company uses a different platform configuration.\n\nThe investigation found Varipulse operates as intended and there is no difference in the performance of the available system configurations globally. J&J responded to the finding by resuming the limited market release of the PFA device in the U.S.\n\nRBC Capital Markets analysts said the resumption is \u201ca positive step\u201d for Varipulse that will allow J&J to expand into the \u201cfast evolving\u201d U.S. PFA market. However, the RBC analysts and their counterparts at J.P. Morgan said J&J has work to do to regain momentum.\n\nJ&J said it found \u201cneurovascular events may increase if a high number of ablations, the stacking of ablations, and/or ablations outside of the pulmonary veins are delivered.\u201d The finding led the company to update the instructions for use. J&J is asking healthcare professionals who use Varipulse to review the updated instructions and share information with patients.\n\nRBC analysts\u2019 interactions with doctors suggest the pause \u201cimpacted their enthusiasm for device uptake.\u201d The analysts said J&J will have \u201cto take meaningful steps to educate healthcare professionals,\u201d but they continue to believe the company \u201cshould be able to drive Varipulse adoption.\u201d\n\nJ.P. Morgan analysts were more downbeat. Physician feedback on Varipulse is \u201calready mixed\u201d based on their channel checks, the analysts said, and the findings of the investigation \u201ccould significantly hinder the product\u2019s rollout in the U.S. and globally\u201d and lead doctors to \u201cde-prioritize Varipulse.\u201d That prediction reflects the belief safety is the main draw of PFA, and J&J\u2019s rivals have a cleaner profile.\n\nBoston Scientific\u2019s Farapulse, which has made an explosive launch, could be \u201cthe biggest beneficiary of Varipulse\u2019s challenges,\u201d the J.P. Morgan analysts said. The analysts said J&J\u2019s problems also simplify the rollout of Medtronic\u2019s Affera and PulseSelect devices and, once it comes to market, Abbott\u2019s Volt.",

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 73% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Johnson & Johnson.\n\nView our latest analysis for Johnson & Johnson\n\nNYSE:JNJ Ownership Breakdown February 18th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Johnson & Johnson?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that Johnson & Johnson does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Johnson & Johnson's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nNYSE:JNJ Earnings and Revenue Growth February 18th 2025\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Johnson & Johnson. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.7% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.6% of the company stock.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.",

The case to be heard in Houston over the coming days constitutes one of the largest settlements ever reached in a mass tort bankruptcy case, JNJ said. The settlement represents a value of approximately $10 billion over 25 years, or about $8 billion in today\u2019s terms.\n\nSpecifically the case relates to over 62,000 plaintiffs who say JNJ\u2019s baby powder and other talc products were contaminated with asbestos, which led to cancers.\n\nBloomberg reported in December that the case was to be delayed until March, however Reuters and the Wall Street Journal report the hearing is beginning today. A website administered by the claims agent for Red River Talc LLC, the JNJ subsidiary, shows a combined hearing due to begin Tuesday, February 18th.\n\nJNJ Says It Has the Votes\n\nErik Haas, JNJ\u2019s Worldwide Vice President of Litigation, said the plan had \u201coverwhelming support\u201d from victims. In September JNJ said it had won backing from approximately 83% of current claimants for the proposed bankruptcy plan.\n\nJNJ says the plan \u201caffords claimants a far better recovery than they stand to recover at trial.\u201d Opponents say it forces victims to accept lower payments than they otherwise might secure at trial.\n\nThe company said in a statement last year that the plan would resolve 99.75% of all pending talc lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson and its affiliates in the United States.\n\nReuters notes that U.S. bankruptcy law allows this kind of settlement to bind those claimants who would prefer to litigate their cases, while also preventing new talc lawsuits from being filed against the company in future.\n\nIt comes as lawyers in the UK representing 3,500 claimants prepare to sue JNJ for links between its talc powder and cancer. The U.S. company is alleged to have been aware that its talc powder contained asbestos as early as the 1970s.\n\nA study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology last May found that applying talc powder was associated with ovarian cancer. JNJ continues to say that none of the talc-related claims against it have merit.\n\nIs JNJ a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on JNJ stock, based on six Buys and eight Holds. The average JNJ price target of $167.50 implies around 7% upside from current levels.\n\nSee more JNJ analyst ratings\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

It says the third effort can succeed where the others faltered because it now has votes showing a broad level of support for its settlement proposal.\n\nopen image in gallery Supreme Court Talc Lawsuit ( Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu )\n\nThe judge will listen to supporters and opponents of J&J\u2019s bankruptcy proposal in a marathon court hearing that will last until the end of February.\n\nLopez will consider evidence on a wide range of topics, including the validity of the votes that J&J gathered last year and whether such a wealthy company should be able to use a subsidiary\u2019s bankruptcy to protect itself from lawsuits.\n\nJ&J argues that bankruptcy offers a faster and fairer way to put money into the hands of cancer victims, who would otherwise face lengthy legal battles in a \u2018lottery-like\u2019 court system that results in large verdicts for some plaintiffs and nothing for others.\n\nErik Haas, J&J\u2019s vice president for litigation, said in a statement that the bankruptcy proposal has \u201coverwhelming support\u201d from cancer victims and \u201caffords claimants a far better recovery than they stand to recover at trial.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the deal argue that the bankruptcy settlement should not bind those who do not like the terms and would prefer to take their chances in court.\n\nBy pushing the deal through a subsidiary\u2019s bankruptcy, J&J is trying to force women with ovarian cancer to accept lower settlement payments based on a deeply flawed vote, according to opponents.\n\nThe key witnesses in the hearing will include plaintiffs lawyers who support and oppose the deal.\n\nJ&J has turned to bankruptcy to end the litigation, because U.S. bankruptcy law allows such a deal to bind claimants who would prefer to litigate their cases.

Credit: Orawan Pattarawimonchai / Shutterstock.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is set to resume the limited market release of the Varipulse Catheter, a treatment option for atrial fibrillation (AFib), in the US.\n\nThe temporary suspension of the device\u2019s US rollout began on 5 January 2025, following reports of four stroke events. This suspension affected the US External Evaluation and all Varipulse cases in the country.\n\nHowever, the latest decision to resume the market release follows a comprehensive investigation that confirmed the device\u2019s function as intended.\n\nThe investigation, which looked into device, procedure, and patient-related factors, concluded that there is no difference in the performance of the Varipulse system configurations available worldwide.\n\nHowever, it was found that the risk of neurovascular events may increase with a high number of ablations, stacking of ablations, or ablations performed outside of the pulmonary veins.\n\nIn a press statement, Johnson & Johnson said: \u201cWe will continue to educate healthcare professionals with guidance around recommended practices aligned to our clinical studies.\u201d\n\nThe device will be available in all markets where it is launched commercially.\n\nThe company also plans to update Varipulse\u2019s instructions for use to provide enhanced guidance.\n\nHealthcare providers are required to examine and comply with the revised IFU and share this information with patients.\n\nThe system, which integrates pulsed field ablation (PFA) therapy with advanced mapping capabilities, is designed to deliver precise ablations to increase safety.\n\nThe catheter\u2019s full integration is expected to minimise the need for multiple visualisation methods used in a single procedure, thereby creating a streamlined workflow.\n\nIn November 2024, it received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of drug-refractory paroxysmal AFib.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other best drug stocks to buy now.\n\nIs China the Next Big Thing in the Pharmaceutical Industry?\n\nLarge American pharmaceutical companies are showing a distinct trend never seen before: they are increasingly looking for medicines in China. According to data from DealForma, as reported by CNBC, around 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million upfront in 2024 included Chinese companies. This was up from 20% the year before and almost 0% only five years prior. The surge in China deals is materializing when US policymakers and President Donald Trump are pursuing protectionist policies in technology, such as semiconductors and AI.\n\nVarious reasons are being attributed to this trend. Experts believe that Chinese companies are developing more effective molecules than ever before, that too in large quantities. They are in a position to begin testing these molecules on human subjects quicker and at a lower price than the US. Buyers have devised a business model allowing them to essentially import the medicines through licensing deals, according to CNBC. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China.\n\nDespite varying opinions among experts, there is an industry-wide consensus that this unique trend is here to stay. How this trend might affect the US biotech sector remains unclear at the moment. While some people believe it could potentially ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at low price, others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry. Either way, this trend is anticipated to metamorphose the landscape of the American biopharma sector. CNBC reported that Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel\u2019s global healthcare group, said the following about the situation:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a watershed moment where the pharma industry is like, \u2018We don\u2019t really need to buy U.S. biotechs necessarily. We will if it makes sense, but we can buy perfectly good biotech assets through licensing deals with Chinese companies.\u201d\n\nWhat Does the Future of the Pharmaceutical Sector Look Like?\n\nEY believes the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity in 2025 compared to 2024, especially if interest rates remain low. Although the industry may see an increase in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, smaller strategic deals are expected to persist throughout the year. The policy environment in the US is undergoing changes due to political impacts on business, such as re-regulation, lower corporate taxes, continued drug pricing reforms, and the possibility of higher tariffs. Other factors that may affect the biotech and pharmaceutical industries include changes in leadership within health agencies and immigration.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is in the midst of attempting to finalize a historic settlement of thousands of cancer-related lawsuits through the bankruptcy of its subsidiary: Red River Talc. However, two U.S. federal health agencies \u2013 the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) \u2013 are challenging the proposal, raising concerns about the potential impact on the government\u2019s ability to recover health care costs.\n\nJ&J\u2019s talcum powder products \u2013 most notably Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder, which allegedly contained asbestos \u2013 have been linked to ovarian cancer and mesothelioma in numerous lawsuits.\n\nAsbestos exposure is the only cause of mesothelioma, a rare but deadly form of cancer that affects the lining of the lungs, heart or abdomen.\n\nWhile mesothelioma is less frequently discussed in Johnson & Johnson talc litigation, the presence of asbestos in talc is a serious concern.\n\nGovernment Concerns Over Health Care Costs\n\nJohnson & Johnson is using a bankruptcy strategy of creating a subsidiary company to shoulder legal liabilities and having that subsidiary file for bankruptcy. Filing for bankruptcy would shield the subsidiary from future lawsuits related to Johnson & Johnson talcum powder products, which the health care conglomerate no longer makes.\n\nThe VA and HHS are concerned that the proposed $8 billion bankruptcy settlement could prevent federal health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid \u2013 which have covered the costs of treating cancer patients harmed by J&J\u2019s talc \u2013 from seeking reimbursement.\n\nAsbestos-related diseases, including mesothelioma, can lead to costly long-term care, which is often covered by these programs. The agencies argue that the current bankruptcy plan lacks clarity on whether the government would retain its right to recover these expenses.\n\nThe VA also represents veterans with asbestos-related diseases. In the United States, approximately one-third (33%) of people with mesothelioma are military veterans.\n\nIn their objections, the agencies point out that the plan appears contradictory. In some sections, the bankruptcy plan suggests government rights will remain intact, while in others, it implies J&J\u2019s liability will be erased.\n\nGiven the significant costs involved in treating asbestos-related cancers like mesothelioma, clarity on this issue is crucial for protecting federal interests.\n\nAsbestos, Mesothelioma, and the Broader Talc Litigation\n\nThe dangers of asbestos have been well-documented for decades, and the idea that J&J\u2019s talc products may have contained asbestos has raised alarm among those affected by both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.\n\nMesothelioma, often associated with asbestos exposure from working in industrial or construction occupations, can also develop from contact with asbestos-contaminated talc.\n\nTalc and asbestos are both naturally occurring minerals. They can mix together during mining, and asbestos can contaminate talc during manufacturing. Talc can absorb moisture and keep skin healthy, which is why companies like Johnson & Johnson used it in skincare and cosmetic products for decades. However, the presence of asbestos makes talc a dangerous ingredient.\n\nThe latency period for mesothelioma is long, meaning that people exposed to asbestos from using Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder decades ago may only now be developing symptoms, adding further complexity to the potential future claims against J&J.\n\nLegal Challenges and the Path Forward\n\nJanuary 2025 marked a key deadline for objections to J&J\u2019s bankruptcy plan. In addition to the VA and HHS, the U.S. Trustee, attorneys for cancer victims, and insurers also filed objections, arguing that the plan unfairly limits the rights of those harmed by asbestos exposure.\n\nMany victims argue that they should be allowed to pursue their lawsuits individually rather than being forced into a settlement that may not fully compensate them for their suffering. In most cases, mesothelioma lawsuits that lead to individual settlements or verdicts give victims far more compensation than group settlements or asbestos trust fund payments.\n\nJ&J, which faces more than 58,000 ongoing talc-related lawsuits, including claims related to both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, insists its proposed settlement is a fair and efficient resolution. The company claims more than 80% of the plaintiffs support the settlement.\n\nThe court is set to hear J&J\u2019s defense of its bankruptcy plan later in 2025. Johnson & Johnson has already attempted this bankruptcy route twice, and both times judges blocked the maneuver. Now, the company is pushing it through the Texas bankruptcy court system, which is often more favorable to these tactics.\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez is scheduled to preside over a multi-day hearing in Houston, TX, where the competing demands of the government, cancer victims and J&J will be weighed.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other forever stocks.\n\nState of The Market in The Wake of The CPI Report\n\nThe first month of 2025 was an interesting one, with inflation rising faster than expected, giving another motivation for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged. The consumer price index, a comprehensive measure of expenses in goods and services throughout the US economy, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% for January, bringing the annual inflation rate to 3%. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the CPI increased 0.4%, bringing the 12-month inflation rate to 3.3%, higher than the projections of 0.3% and 3.1%, respectively. According to Josh Jamner, investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge Investments, the report spells the end of the Fed\u2019s rate-cutting cycles:\n\n\u201cThe \u2018wait and see\u2019 Fed is going to be waiting longer than anticipated after a red-hot January CPI inflation report. This report puts the final nail in the coffin for the rate cut cycle, which we believe is over.\u201d\n\nIn addition, policymakers are also keeping a watch on the White House in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s advocacy for high tariffs, which might boost prices and make it more difficult for the Fed to reach its goal. Speaking on this, James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said the following:\n\n\u201cThere is no getting away from the fact that this is a hot report and with the sense that potential tariffs run upside risk for inflation the market is understandably of the view the Federal Reserve is going to find it challenging to justify rate cuts in the near future,\u201d\n\nWhile the consumer price index release is a widely cited inflation gauge, it isn\u2019t the principal metric the Federal Reserve uses. Rather, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure is the personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish later this month, although it also monitors the CPI and other comparable pricing indices. In his remarks before the House Financial Services Committee on February 12, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the Fed\u2019s increased emphasis on the PCE measure but acknowledged that \u201cwe\u2019re not quite there yet\u201d on inflation, despite the \u201cgreat progress\u201d that has been done so far.\n\nIn such a macroeconomic environment, the notion of acquiring the best \u201cforever stocks\u201d might appear challenging. That said, although investors may gravitate toward riskier options with bigger potential returns, it is crucial to recognize that long-term stock investments have their worth and importance.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWhen it comes to long-term investing, who better to emulate than Warren Buffett, arguably the most well-known investor on Wall Street? To come up with our list of the best forever stocks, we began by evaluating Buffett\u2019s stock portfolio, focusing on stock holdings that had been in his portfolio for at least 5 years. Next, we looked at the number of hedge fund investors linked with each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 funds in the third quarter of 2024. The following names are ranked according to hedge fund sentiments around them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a leading player in the healthcare sector, including sub-sectors such as medicines, Medtech equipment, and consumer health goods. The company is renowned for creating medications to treat a variety of ailments and diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also has several other potential development prospects, including the robotic-assisted surgical business.\n\nOn February 3, Guggenheim increased its price target for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) from $162 to $166 while reaffirming its Neutral rating on the company\u2019s shares. The adjustment followed JNJ\u2019s Q4 2024 results, which showed $22.5 billion in revenue and $2.04 in profits per share. Guggenheim praised Johnson & Johnson\u2019s performance, including the initial forecast for 2025, despite increased competition from Stelara biosimilars in the US market. The recent acquisition of ITCI is also intended to increase Johnson & Johnson\u2019s foothold in the mental health industry, with the transaction slated to be completed in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nOn January 13, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) announced the $14.6 billion acquisition of IntraCellular, a neurological pharmaceutical.

While we acknowledge the potential of JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Johnson scored eight of those points in an impressive closing effort.\n\nAs the game started, Texas head coach Rodney Terry was forced to call a timeout at the 16:33 mark as Kentucky took a 9-3 lead on an open three by Travis Perry for a 7-0 run as the Horns went more than two minutes without scoring, missing a number of quality looks in a 1-of-7 shooting start. In fact, the ball hadn\u2019t even gone through the basket for Texas because the score credited to Johnson was knocked off the rim by a Kentucky player.\n\nAfter the timeout, the Longhorns responded with Mark hitting a floater and Johnson taking advantage of a mismatch for soft, driving layup to cut the deficit to three points at the first media timeout.\n\nIt was the start of a 6-of-9 stretch for Texas that included the team\u2019s first made three by junior guard Jordan Pope more than eight minutes into the game, heading into under-12 timeout trailing 17-15 with a free throw for Kentucky pending on a potential three-point play.\n\nThe Wildcats couldn\u2019t convert, but Mark did on the other end, scoring five straight points for the Longhorns to take the lead. Texas turned offense into defense to extend it as a steal by Pope led to a layup by senior forward Jayson Kent and Johnson jumped a passing lane to create a transition layup for himself, forcing Kentucky to call a timeout at the 8:45 mark with the Horns up 24-19.\n\nA made basket by the Cats ended a stretch of five missed shots over two minutes to cut into the deficit at the third media timeout, but Kentucky bounced back to take a 33-32 lead on a Trent Noah three before the under-four break.\n\nJohnson hit a step-back three, his first after missing his first four, and Mark made a tough, driving layup to stop a 10-2 run by the Wildcats, but Kentucky responded with the final four points of the first half to take a 41-37 lead into halftime.\n\nNeither team shot well from three in the first half \u2014 Texas went 3-of-14 shooting (21.4 percent) and Kentucky was 3-of-13 shooting (23.1 percent) with the Horns holding a 9-2 edge in fast-break points the Wildcats made up for by hitting 8-of-11 free throws as the home team only attempted two, making both.\n\nThe three-point struggles for the Wildcats continued in the second half, hitting 3-of-11 shots from beyond the arc, and the Longhorns were able to defend the off-ball cuts by Kentucky well enough to limit the visitors to 41.9-percent shooting overall, including 37.9 percent in the second half.\n\nTexas struggled to secure defensive rebounds after halftime, allowing Kentucky to come up with half of their 18 misses, but the Wildcats couldn\u2019t convert enough of those opportunities with six second-chance points. For the game, Kentucky turned 18 offensive rebounds into 14 second-chance points.\n\nA break in the conference schedule means that Texas doesn\u2019t play again until next Saturday on the road against South Carolina against the last-place Gamecocks, winless in 12 conference games.",

Johnson scored his 32 points on 11-for-26 shooting and a 9-for-10 night from the line. Johnson made just one three-pointer in eight attempts. He scored 17 points in the second half and played all 20 minutes of the final period.\n\nMark posted his best point total in a Texas uniform. He had 26 points on 9-for-14 shooting, including a 3-for-5 night from three and a 5-for-6 night at the charity stripe.\n\nJordan Pope was the only other Longhorn who approached double figures with nine points.\n\nTexas was down 70-67 with 3:11 left after UK\u2019s Otega Oweh made a free throw attempt. From there, Mark scored the next four points to take the lead. Johnson then hit a free throw, Kadin Shedrick tapped a ball in for two, and Johnson had his own four-point flurry to give Texas a 78-70 lead with 34 seconds left.\n\nUK cut the lead down to five with 18 seconds left, but the Longhorns broke the Wildcat press and Shedrick slammed home a dunk to excite the Moody Center crowd for an important SEC win.\n\nJayson Kent earned his second start as a Longhorn and notched six points. Shedrick added five. Ze\u2019Rik Onyema scored four points and committed four fouls in 12 minutes.\n\nFor Kentucky, they were not at full force. Lamont Butler, Jaxson Robinson, and Kerr Kriisa were all out, leaving the Wildcats without a point guard. That guard trio also regularly combines to average over 30 points per game.\n\nUK received 20 points from Oweh and 11 points from Amari Williams.\n\nTexas shot 45 percent from the field, 22 percent from three, and 83 percent from the line. Kentucky was 42 percent from the field, 25 percent from three, and 71 percent at the line. Texas outrebounded Kentucky 41-40, and also recorded six steals.\n\nThe win is an important resume booster for Texas, who had lost three consecutive Quadrant 1 games.

            "content": "This article originally ran on Feb. 15, 2025. It was updated on Feb. 28 with additional information from the FDA about the Class I recall.\n\nJohnson & Johnson MedTech (NYSE: JNJ) + announced that it intends to resume the rollout of its Varipulse platform in the U.S. after a temporary pause.\n\nLast month, the medtech giant said it temporarily halted all U.S. cases using its Varipulse pulsed field ablation (PFA) system. It attributed the pause to an investigation of the root cause of four reported neurovascular events in a U.S. External Evaluation. A special configuration of the U.S. platform meant the issue did not extend to commercial Varipulse activity outside the U.S.\n\nAnalysts said the company \u201cpaused sales of its Varipulse PFA system due to reports of strokes with the device.\u201d They cited a report of a stroke in the FDA\u2019s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. That indicated that a patient experienced a stroke following Varipulse treatment. The analysts said at least two additional patients had strokes following Varipulse procedures in Europe.\n\nLate Feb. 14, the company said it planned to resume its limited U.S. Varipulse rollout after an investigation \u201cfound the devices operate as intended.\u201d Johnson & Johnson MedTech plans to update the Varipulse catheter\u2019s instructions for use globally to include enhanced guidance.\n\nThe investigation looked at potential device-, procedure- and patient-related factors. It found no difference in performance of the available Varipulse configurations globally. The company said it found the potential for neurovascular events to increase as a result of the delivery of a high number of ablations, the stacking of ablations, and/or ablations outside of the pulmonary veins.\n\nJohnson & Johnson MedTech said it continues communications with healthcare professionals to recommend they review and adhere to the updated instructions and share the information with patients.\n\n\u201cVaripulse is an important treatment option for patients with atrial fibrillation and remains available in all markets where commercially launched,\u201d the company concluded.\n\nFDA releases more details about the issues that led to the initial pause\n\nIn a Feb. 28 notice, the FDA outlined updated instructions for use released by Johnson & Johnson related to the Varipulse system. The instructions direct users to determine whether the balance of risk and benefits support using the device, considering the patient\u2019s individual situation, with the known and inherent risk of neurovascular events.\n\nJohnson & Johnson updated the instructions due to a high rate of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA or \u201cmini stroke), the FDA said. These risks were seen in the first 132 procedures after FDA approval in November 2024. The FDA said the company limited its distribution to a few U.S. hospitals to get more feedback.\n\nOf the 132 patients treated during this limited evaluation, four patients (approximately 3%) had a stroke or mini stroke shortly after surgery. This exceeded the frequency expected for this type of surgery (typically 1% or less) according to the FDA.\n\nThe company investigated the surgeries that resulted in these events and found some differences between how the device was used and the recommendations in the use instructions. These differences could explain the higher risk of stroke or mini stroke and include treatment of patients with a more advanced form of irregular heart rhythm, more energy deliveries to the heart, repeated energy deliveries to the same location in the heart, and energy deliveries to locations not studied in clinical trials.\n\nBased on the available data that may link these differences to stroke or mini stroke, the company recommends using the device only as studied, which is reflected in the updated use instructions.\n\nJohnson & Johnson also plans to conduct a U.S. Post-Approval Study. This will further investigate the benefits and risks associated with the use of the Varipulse ablation catheter for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\n\nRead more: J&J MedTech\u2019s Varipulse PFA recall investigation finds potential stroke factors\n\nMore about the Johnson & Johnson MedTech Varipulse system\n\nThe Varipulse platform treats AFib with a single device that combines PFA with the Carto 3 mapping system. Its variable-loop, multi-electrode Varipulse catheter uses laser-cut nitinol tubing for its loop shape. The platform also includes TruPulse generator and the Carto 3 3D cardiac mapping system.\n\nJ&J joined Medtronic and Boston Scientific as companies with PFA technologies approved for treating AFib when it received an FDA nod in November.\n\nThe company reported more than 130 cases with Varipulse in the U.S. since it began external evaluation. Those took place across 14 sites and 40 operators. Globally, it reported more than 3,000 commercial cases with Varipulse.\n\nMedtronic\u2019s PulseSelect PFA system became the first to win FDA approval for AFib in 2023. Boston Scientific followed with its Farapulse system in January. Medtronic added to its offerings in October with an FDA nod for its Affera mapping and ablation system with the Sphere-9 catheter.\n\nAt the time of the Varipulse pause, analysts said they expected Boston Scientific and Medtronic to benefit if their systems don\u2019t have similar issues.\n\n\u201cThis news makes us more positive on [Boston Scientific] since our recent downgrade mainly centered on the competitive risk posed by both the [Medtronic] and [Johnson & Johnson] PFA product launches.\u201d\n\nThey also suggested potential issues even when Varipulse sales resume.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear how long the Varipulse sales will remain paused, but even if [Johnson & Johnson] allows sales to be resumed, we believe that the product is now likely to be tainted and that electrophysiologists are likely to be wary of using it,\u201d the analysts wrote.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, cautioned viewers on Wednesday about the risks of blindly following the crowd in the stock market. He emphasized that it is essential to avoid expecting the same outcome as everyone else, as there is a significant chance things will not play out as expected. This, he explained, is because many expectations are often already \"priced in\" to the market.\n\n\u201c... And that's why you need to be extra wary of the IPO cycle. Let's go over this. We've seen the pattern over and over again. We get this deluge of new deals, at first, many of them explode higher, but at the same time they're flooding the market with new stock supply and that supply ultimately drags us down. I've said it a million times, the stock market is like any other market. It's all about supply and demand.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Shed Light on These 10 Stocks and 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar\n\nWhen supply increases too rapidly, prices are likely to fall. He stressed that the enthusiasm surrounding IPOs, particularly when they make early investors substantial profits, creates an environment of palpable excitement. Cramer noted that when interest in these IPOs wanes, that initial exuberance quickly turns to frustration, which can cause broader market declines, not just in IPOs but across the board.\n\nSuch a cycle, Cramer noted, is nothing new. He pointed to 2020 and 2021 as prime examples of how a flood of IPOs and SPAC mergers, fueled by stimulus checks, led many people to invest in trendy stocks. He added:\n\n\u201c2020, we also had a ton of electric vehicle and charging station-related IPOs and SPAC mergers. At first, these stocks were unstoppable, although most of that was because this was a period of high-risk speculation where people were willing to give anything with the right buzzwords.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 12. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).",

            "content": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nWhen Rev. Nelson Johnson died Monday at 81, everyone from local Greensboro activists to the city\u2019s highest elected leaders praised the Civil Rights icon who stayed rooted in the city despite his national profile.\n\nFrom his days as a young radical at N.C. A&T University to surviving the Greensboro Massacre in 1979 and beyond, Johnson earned a reputation as an uncompromising crusader for workers\u2019 rights, the city\u2019s poor, and fighting racism. That often put him at odds with the police, business leaders, and the political establishment.\n\nJim Melvin, mayor of Greensboro for much of the 1970s, once called him\u201dthe most dangerous man in Greensboro.\u201d That reputation lingered long after Johnson became pastor of Faith Community Church and founding co-executive director of The Beloved Community Center of Greensboro.\n\n\u201cIt is somewhat rare for me to be in a setting where I\u2019m not under attack or under suspicion,\u201d Johnson told a crowd at the Bethel AME church in 2015. The line drew knowing laughter, but Johnson wasn\u2019t kidding.\n\nThis week, area leaders and community activists alike\u2014Black and white, Democrat and Republican\u2014paid tribute to his legacy.\n\n\u201cHe came to Greensboro to come to N.C. A&T, to be an Aggie, and this became his chosen home,\u201d said Melvin \u201cSkip\u201d Alston, chair of the Guilford County Board of Commissioners. \u201cThat never changed, because he had a heart for the community. We didn\u2019t always agree, but we could disagree without being disagreeable. I never doubted where his heart was.\u201d\n\nGreensboro Mayor Nancy Vaughan agreed.\n\n\u201cPeople will remember the Greensboro Massacre, of course,\u201d said Vaughan. \u201cBut Rev. Johnson and [his wife] Joyce Johnson continued their work and continued to build future activists, right until a couple months ago. I think that there are a lot of people, not only in this community but throughout the country, who they\u2019ve had a very deep impact on.\u201d\n\nBeing the subject of Johnson\u2019s criticism could be uncomfortable, Vaughan said. But she found Johnson willing to work with city leaders on common goals while remaining firm in his principles. Rev. Nelson Johnson and his wife, Joyce, stand beside a photo of the \u201cGreensboro Massacre\u201d at the Faith Community Church in August 2017. (AP Photo/Allen G. Breed)\n\nRobbie Perkins, a former mayor and current mayoral candidate, said he and Johnson could always keep open lines of communication on city issues, despite their political and cultural differences.\n\n\u201cWe looked for the things we had in common, trying to help folks who needed a leg up, which he was always focused on,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about the past a lot, because we were looking at things in the present moment and concentrating on the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a number of people out there who were impacted by him and his work who are trying to make Greensboro a better place,\u201d Perkins said.\n\nAmong them are current Greensboro City Council hopefuls April Parker and Irving Allen, who both call Johnson a mentor. So does Lamar Gibson, a fundraiser and political adviser now working with the Hip Hop Caucus. He started as an intern with the Beloved Community Center in high school and college and went on to become an organizer and fundraiser.\n\n\n\n\u201cReally everything I\u2019m up to now in my fundraising career is all because of the formative years there,\u201d Gibson said.\n\n\u201cRev was one of the few adults in my life, at that age, who could have a debate with an activist and get back to work,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cAnd I was a pain in the ass. I would argue about strategy. He was patient and the learning for me was transformative.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was also a lightning rod in Greensboro,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThat\u2019s always been the case. It still is.\u201d\n\nA&T, Activism, and Uprising\n\nNelson Johnson was born in Airlie, North Carolina, in 1943. He came of age in a society where segregation and racist violence were like bad weather\u2014a reality for which to prepare, but something few believed they could change.\n\nJohnson joined the Air Force and served as a military policeman before moving to Greensboro in 1965 to attend N.C. A&T. The school, now the largest historically black college or university in America, had been a hub of racial justice activism and social change for generations. In 1960, four of its students had set off a national sit-in movement for desegregation with their demonstration at the downtown Woolworth\u2019s lunch counter.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a history and legacy in Greensboro that we take pride in,\u201d said Alston. \u201cWhen you look at what people were fighting against, the racism and the tactics that were used, it\u2019s ridiculous that then people wanted to blame them for the violence and still blame them today.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got a number of people out there who were impacted by him and his work who are trying to make Greensboro a better place.\u201d Robbie Perkins, former Greensboro mayor\n\nJohnson\u2019s youthful activism targeted injustice on campus as well as off. He rallied other Aggies to support a cafeteria worker strike for better wages, setting up a makeshift eating space in the student union as part of a boycott to pressure the university. He also urged students to act in solidarity with the poor, Black residents of East Greensboro more broadly and worked to build bridges among activist movements across the city.\n\nIn 1969, when a Dudley High School student supportive of the Black Power movement won a landslide victory for student body president, the all-white city school board prevented him from taking office. Johnson helped unite Dudley and A&T students in protests that would come to be called the \u201cGreensboro Uprising.\u201d Clashes between students and police escalated to tear gas and gunfire. The National Guard was called in with a tank, airplane, and helicopter, and hundreds of students were detained or arrested. One A&T student, 22-year-old Willie Grimes, was shot and killed, while a number of police and students suffered serious injuries. The campus was shut down and a state of emergency declared in the city.\n\nJohnson\u2019s college activism solidified a radical reputation that would follow him for the rest of his life.\n\nThe Long Shadow of Tragedy\n\nIn 1970, Johnson helped organize a tenant strike against the city\u2019s largest landlord to improve living conditions. The same year, he helped organize workers at Industries of the Blind, on what was then Lee Street, to strike for better working conditions. He would expand on that work in factories and textile mills throughout the Triad and beyond, putting him on the radar of local police, the State Bureau of Investigation, and the FBI.\n\n\u201cI had relatives growing up in Greensboro who worked in those textile mills,\u201d said Gibson. \u201cEven within my family, there were mixed views of Rev. Johnson. Some people felt he was trying to do party building as much as labor organizing.\u201d\n\nBy the late \u201870s Johnson\u2019s multi-racial group of activists, the Workers Viewpoint Organization, had become the Communist Workers Party. The shift divided and alienated even some of his allies. It incensed local Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups, who were as rabidly anti-communist as they were racist. Johnson\u2019s group confronted and clashed with them, setting up the conflict that would follow him throughout his life.\n\nOn November 3, 1979, Johnson and other members of the Communist Workers Party met at the largely Black Morningside Homes public housing project for what they billed as a \u201cDeath to the Klan\u201d rally. Members of the Klan and the American Nazi Party arrived with a cache of guns, killing five protesters and injuring at least 10 more, Johnson among them.\n\nSigne Waller leads marchers on what would become a fateful day in Greensboro, N.C. (Jim Stratford /News & Record via AP) Nelson Johnson kneels by victim in aftermath of the shooting on Nov. 3, 1979. (Jim Stratford /News & Record via AP)\n\nThe tragedy garnered national attention, upended the lives of its survivors, and led to years of investigations, court cases, and a Truth and Reconciliation process.\n\nLast year, writer Aran Shetterly published a book reexamining the history and context of the event, Morningside: The 1979 Greensboro Massacre and the Struggle for an American City\u2019s Soul. It was important, the author said, to also shine a light on the work Johnson did in the many years after.\n\n\u201cThe thing about Nelson Johnson is, his legacy is so much more than that event,\u201d Shetterly said in an interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s really the people in Greensboro, it seems to me, because of that event, who don\u2019t understand the huge impact he\u2019s had on movement work all around the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust go down and start to think of the people who have considered him a mentor,\u201d Shetterly said, listing notables like Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow; Ai-jen Poo, the president of the National Domestic Workers Alliance; and William Barber, the former head of the state NAACP and co-founder of the Poor Peoples\u2019 Campaign. \u201cThe thing about Nelson Johnson is, his legacy is so much more than that event.\u201d Aran Shetterly, author of a book on the Greensboro Massacre\n\nThough many of those he mentored or inspired would go on to larger platforms, Johnson remained focused on Greensboro. In the 1980s, two all-white juries acquitted the men accused of the Greensboro Massacre killings. But a civil jury found six members of the Klan and American Nazi party liable for wrongful deaths, and found two Greensboro police officers had foreknowledge of the attack but failed to prevent it.\n\nJohnson eventually finished his undergraduate studies at A&T in 1986 and, after earning a master of divinity at Virginia Union School of Theology, returned to the Gate City to preach at Faith Community Church. He later founded the Beloved Community Center, from which he continued his activism and trained generations of organizers. His work continued to focus on the poor and on racial justice, including rallying local faith leaders to support workers trying to unionize a Kmart distribution center in Greensboro in the early 1990s.\n\n\u201cNelson\u2019s big ambition was, in his words, to make Greensboro a model,\u201d Shetterly said. \u201cAnd he believed that Greensboro could be a model for other cities around the country in terms of how it organized itself and how it treated its citizens. And if that could happen, that would be big.\u201d\n\n\u2018He Found a Way\u2019\n\nGreensboro Mayor Pro Tem Marikay Abuzuaiter said she saw firsthand how Johnson, in his later years, married the fiery activism of his youth with the wisdom of hard-won lessons.\n\n\u201cHe always had that passion, you could see it and that never changed,\u201d Abuzuaiter said. \u201cWhen he was focused on something, you knew he was going to continue to pursue it, even if he didn\u2019t succeed at first. And I admired that. He found a way to work with people, he found a way to succeed.\u201d\n\nThat included pushing the city government to officially acknowledge and apologize for its part in the events of the Greensboro Massacre in a series of statements from 2017 to 2020. He also worked tirelessly to get an accurate historical marker in a city still very much divided over who was to blame and how to characterize the tragedy. Joyce and Nelson Johnson stand beside the historical marker for the Greensboro Massacre in August 2017. (AP Photo/Allen G. Breed)\n\nIn the mid-2000s, when Black police officers in the city alleged a pattern of harassment and unfounded investigations leading all the way to the police chief, they came to Johnson for advice and support. It was a gut-check moment, many of his friends and allies said, given the department\u2019s historic resistance to accepting any responsibility for the Greensboro Massacre.\n\n\u201cI was pissed when the Black officers came to Reverend Johnson for support,\u201d said Gibson. \u201cI had no idea, with what he\u2019d experienced, how he could be an advocate for anybody in the Greensboro Police Department. I didn\u2019t understand then that the same sense of obligation that led him to defend the legacies of his friends and the people lost on November 3 was the same obligation he was carrying when those officers came to him to seek his counsel and support.\u201d\n\nIt still bothers Gibson so many people still think only of the events of 1979 when Johnson\u2019s name is mentioned. The reverend lived with that and stayed anyway, Gibson said.\n\n\u201cHe still chose this city, and he still chose to do the work here,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThat was part of his love and his faith that I could use more of myself. We all could.\u201d\n\nJohnson is survived by his wife, Joyce; daughters Akua Johnson-Matherson and Ayo Johnson; as well as granddaughters Alise, Imani, and Nia and grandson Nelson Josiah.\n\n\n\nInformation on public viewing and funeral arrangements, along with details on how to contribute to the Nelson N. Johnson Legacy Fund, can he found here.\n\nJoe Killian is The Assembly\u2019s Greensboro editor. He joined us from NC Newsline, where he was senior investigative reporter.\n\nMore by this author",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Johnson & Johnson's shares before the 18th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 4th of March.\n\nThe company's upcoming dividend is US$1.24 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$4.96 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Johnson & Johnson has a trailing yield of 3.2% on the current share price of US$155.26. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Johnson & Johnson can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Johnson & Johnson\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. It paid out 85% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. It could become a concern if earnings started to decline.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nNYSE:JNJ Historic Dividend February 13th 2025\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks with flat earnings can still be attractive dividend payers, but it is important to be more conservative with your approach and demand a greater margin for safety when it comes to dividend sustainability. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're not enthused to see that Johnson & Johnson's earnings per share have remained effectively flat over the past five years. We'd take that over an earnings decline any day, but in the long run, the best dividend stocks all grow their earnings per share. A high payout ratio of 85% generally happens when a company can't find better uses for the cash. Combined with slim earnings growth in the past few years, Johnson & Johnson could be signalling that its future growth prospects are thin.",

Credit: Shutterstock / Saiful52.\n\nJohnson and Johnson (J&J) has announced the cancellation of its Phase III E.mbrace study examining Sanofi\u2019s investigational vaccine for extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. Coli) after results were found to be underwhelming.\n\nThe multinational healthcare giant put a stop to the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT04899336) after an independent interim analysis found that the vaccine, known as ExPEC, failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy in preventing the invasive disease compared to placebo.\n\nIn October of 2023, Sanofi and J&J entered an agreement that saw Sanofi pay out $250m upfront. Originally initiated in 2021, the trial enrolled nearly 20,000 participants at 250 sites across five continents, with J&J subsidiary Janssen Research & Development heading up the process. The trial specifically sought to recruit patients aged 60 and above with a recent history of urinary tract infection.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Toussaint, global head of research and development in vaccines at Sanofi, said: \u201cWe are disappointed to see that the vaccine was not associated with sufficient efficacy to support the trial continuation, and we will work tirelessly to understand the factors behind the IDMC\u2019s finding and to share further analysis once available.\n\n\u201cWhile disappointed by this outcome, we remain steadfast in our commitment to drive innovation in R&D by developing first and best-in-class vaccines in areas of high unmet need.\u201d\n\nFollowing the announcement, Sanofi recorded an impairment charge before tax of $250m, but stated there had been no resulting impact to its net income.\n\nResearch by GlobalData estimates that if the drug had been successful, it would have generated sales of around $464m by the end of 2030. Of that, more than half was forecast to come from the US market.\n\nE. Coli typically manifests as food poisoning that stemmed from undercooked or poorly stored food. While some strains of E. Coli can generally be tolerated, the infection can, in severe cases, result in death.\n\nThe US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that the O157:H7 strain E. Coli causes 73,000 illnesses across the US annually.\n\nElsewhere in the E. Coli space, the US Army has awarded a contract to develop bacteriophages to treat uropathogenic E.

The two companies were co-funding research and development and planned to share profits in major markets including the U.S. Sanofi had high hopes for the vaccine, at one point telling investors it could bring in between 2 billion and 5 billion euros, or as much as about $5.2 billion, in peak sales.\n\nAs part of the October 2023 deal, Sanofi paid J&J $175 million up front and agreed to future payments based on development and commercial milestones.

SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nThe trial, which began in June 2021, recruited older adults aged 60 and above who had a recent history of urinary tract infections and were otherwise in stable health.\n\nIt was conducted across more than 250 sites spanning five continents.\n\nDespite rigorous testing and monitoring, the vaccine did not produce the desired immune response to move forward.\n\nJ&J confirmed that an independent review of the data found no safety issues, and the company is now conducting follow-ups with participants who had already received the vaccine.\n\nShares of J&J were unchanged in pre-market trading on Thursday.\n\nSanofi, which partnered with J&J\u2019s Janssen unit in the development of the vaccine, disclosed that it had recorded a $250 million charge related to the halted trial in its fourth-quarter earnings report.\n\n3 The experimental vaccine, known as ExPEC9V, was designed to protect against bloodstream infections and sepsis caused by E.coli bacteria. Getty Images\n\nHowever, the company reassured investors that the financial setback would not affect its 2025 revenue forecast, which was issued in January.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Toussaint, head of vaccine research and development at Sanofi, stated that the companies would analyze the trial results to understand why the vaccine failed to achieve its intended efficacy.\n\n\u201cWe will share further insights once we complete a comprehensive review of the data,\u201d he added.\n\nThe failure of ExPEC9V represents a setback in the ongoing battle against E.coli infections, which pose significant public health risks.\n\nWhile most strains of the bacteria are harmless and commonly found in the intestines of humans and animals, some can cause severe illnesses.\n\nThe more dangerous strains of E.coli can lead to foodborne outbreaks, resulting in symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and, in severe cases, kidney failure.\n\n3 Despite rigorous testing and monitoring, the vaccine did not produce the desired immune response to move forward. Getty Images\n\nOne recent example of the risks posed by E.coli occurred last year when an outbreak linked to McDonald\u2019s Quarter Pounder hamburgers sickened 104 people and hospitalized 34.\n\nThat outbreak was caused by the O157:H7 strain, which is known for producing a dangerous toxin that can lead to severe complications.\n\nThe setback in vaccine development underscores the challenges scientists face in creating effective immunizations against bacterial infections.\n\nUnlike viral diseases, which often have more predictable immune responses, bacterial infections can be more complex, requiring a deeper understanding of how to stimulate long-lasting immunity.\n\nWhile the discontinuation of the ExPEC9V trial is a disappointment, experts believe the insights gained from this study could inform future vaccine development efforts.\n\nBoth J&J and Sanofi said they remain committed to advancing research in infectious disease prevention and will continue to explore alternative solutions to combat E.coli-related illnesses.\n\nFor now, healthcare professionals emphasize the importance of preventive measures, including proper food handling, hygiene, and early treatment of urinary tract infections, to reduce the risks associated with E.coli infections.",

It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

According to her, this cancer is one of the leading causes of death in men and is often missed during the early stages due to a lack of proper testing.\n\nPharmaceutical Executive: Can you discuss the Blue Jacket Fashion Show?\n\nBiljana Naumovic: We have been involved in the Blue Jacket Fashion Show now for almost a decade. It is part of our dedication to the prostate cancer community and is a very unique program that brings forward the discussion around prostate cancer and the need to diagnose early in an unconventional way, but way that is necessary in order for us to freely talk and to normalize the discussion around the needs to diagnose and to treat prostate cancer. It is also something that we strive to do. We have been committed to get in front of cancer at Johnson & Johnson, where we have an ambition to transform the way cancer is treated. The vision we have set for ourselves is to ultimately eliminate cancer, one cancer type at a time. One of the ways that we can attack that is to get in front of cancer very early on, while also supporting the communities that are more gravely affected by prostate cancer, like African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latino communities, and supporting them in diagnosis. That\u2019s what Blue Jacket Fashion Show is all about.\n\nPE: Do you think that the pharma industry needs to take more unconventional steps to reach underserved communities?\n\nNaumovic: For some things, absolutely yes. Especially around support for early diagnosis and helping people talk about how they can get tested and diagnosed on time. The biggest problem that we have in general is that people get diagnosed too late. There is a stigma that exists in prostate cancer, especially around discussing prostate cancer and getting the tests that are needed early on. I think being unconventional about this supports people in understanding that this really has to be normalized, and we have to take care of our health before it becomes disease.\n\nPE: Which communities are most underserved in prostate cancer?\n\nNaumovic: When you look at prostate cancer overall, it is the second highest incidence of cancer in men. It is also one of the cancer types with increasing incidence in the United States. Within the African American community, the incidence of prostate cancer is about 70% higher in black men versus white men. In the Hispanic community, this is the most common cancer diagnosis among Hispanic men with around 23,000 patients in this community being diagnosed per year in the United States. For Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, the diagnosis rates are not as early as they should be. These are some of the things that are relevant to be understood so that we can address every community in the way that they need to be addressed.",

(AP) \u2014 Chase Briscoe led a banner night for Toyota in qualifying for the Daytona 500 by winning the pole for NASCAR\u2019s \u201cGreat American Race.\u201d\n\nIt is the first Daytona 500 pole for Briscoe, who moved to Joe Gibbs Racing this season when Stewart-Haas Racing closed at the end of 2024. His move to the No. 19 gave Toyota its first pole in NASCAR\u2019s biggest race of the season.\n\n\u201cA great way to start our season. Unbelievable way to start off the year. Unbelievable way to start off with Toyota,\u201d said Briscoe. \u201cTo be able to be the guy to deliver them the first anything when they\u2019ve already accomplished so much is pretty cool. To think I\u2019m going to start on the front row or on the pole of the \u2018Great American Race\u2019 with ultimately the great American brand of (sponsor) Bass Pro Shops is unbelievable. Can\u2019t thank Coach Gibbs enough, the entire Joe Gibbs Racing organization.\u201d\n\nBriscoe\u2019s lap of 182.745 mph held off a slew of Ford challengers. Former Daytona 500 winner Austin Cindric qualified second in a Ford for Team Penske, which started from the pole last year with Joey Logano, who closed the year as NASCAR Cup Series champion.\n\nFord drivers claimed four of the top five spots in time trials, but only Briscoe and Cindric as the front row starters were locked in Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cA lot of fast Fords,\u201d said Cindric. \u201cPretty good to start on the front row with one of my good friends. All in all, a great box checked for the start of this week. I think every single part of this weekend is important to setting up with an opportunity to win this race on Sunday.\u201d\n\nThe only other drivers locked in during time trials were Toyota drivers Jimmie Johnson and Martin Truex Jr., who were not guaranteed entry but posted speeds fast enough to claim two of the four \u201copen\u201d spots in the race.\n\nThe remainder of the starting order is set Thursday night in a pair of qualifying races.\n\nThere are nine drivers entered for four open spots and Truex and Johnson claimed two of them in time trials. Johnson is a seven-time NASCAR champion, two-time Daytona 500 winner and member of the Hall of Fame. Truex is the 2017 Cup champion and in his first year of not racing NASCAR full-time.\n\n\u201cBoth Jimmie and I were beneficiaries of their (Toyota\u2019s) hard work on their engines,\u201d Truex said.\n\nBoth would have been eligible to request the \u201cworld-class driver\u201d provisional that guarantees entry as a 41st car to one driver who does not compete full-time in NASCAR and brings marketability and visibility to the biggest race of the season.\n\nThe provisional will go to four-time Indianapolis 500 winner Helio Castroneves if he fails to race his way in Thursday night. If he takes the provisional, Trackhouse Racing will not receive any points or purse money, and the field will be 41 cars \u2014 the largest field since 43 cars was the standard in 2015.\n\nJohnson said his Legacy Motor Club was unaware of the provisional until it was announced earlier this year \u2014 even though it was a new rule included in the charter agreement teams signed in September. The rule required a team to request the provisional 90 days before the event, and the rule was not publicly announced until after the deadline for the Daytona 500 had passed.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know about it until the rule came out. Evidently, it was buried in the charter agreement that came out,\u201d Johnson said earlier Wednesday. \u201cBut when the rule came out, I forget the time of the morning, three minutes later, we were on the phone with NASCAR and recognized it wasn\u2019t within the 90 day-window and we weren\u2019t eligible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of talks with everyone at NASCAR and I have a better understanding of the intent of the rule, and I would anticipate some changes following (Daytona) to better define and clarify that. When first read, our reaction wasn\u2019t great, but it is what it is and hopefully, we have a fast-enough car to get in.\u201d\n\nHe did, just off the speed of Truex, but it was enough to ensure the two former champions will race Sunday.\n\nThe drivers who must race their way in Thursday, seeking the two remaining spots, are Anthony Alfredo, Justin Allgaier, Corey LaJoie, B.J. McLeod, Chandler Smith and J.J. Yeley. If Castroneves races his way in, there will only be one open spot available.\n\n___\n\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Associated Press.

This subsidiary of J&J has filed for Chapter 11 as a key part of completing the settlement.\n\nIf approved, the approximately $8 billion settlement would resolve tens of thousands of talc lawsuits. These lawsuits come from plaintiffs who claim the company\u2019s talcum powder is linked to ovarian cancer.\n\nSee if You Qualify for a Lawsuit Our Partners Our Trusted Legal Partners Drugwatch partners with trusted law firms to help you take legal action. After submitting the form, one of Drugwatch's partners will contact you for a free case review.\n\nBut there is plenty of resistance to the proposed plan. The issues range from medical reimbursements to the controversial bankruptcy method J&J is using to complete the settlement.\n\nHere are the main parties fighting against the settlement\u2019s completion and why they believe it should not be approved.\n\nGovernment Departments Seek Reimbursement for Medical Costs\n\nTwo major government departments are among the latest to enter the battle to halt J&J\u2019s settlement. In late January, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) both filed an objection to Red River Talc\u2019s bankruptcy, citing their right to reimbursement.\n\nThese departments covered the medical expenses for some patients allegedly harmed by J&J\u2019s talcum powder. Therefore, the departments argue they should be eligible for reimbursement for those costs.\n\nMedicare and Medicaid are housed under the HHS department, while Veterans Affairs provides health care to veterans. Currently, there are nearly 60,000 pending lawsuits claiming that J&J\u2019s baby powder caused ovarian cancer.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the HHS department alone may seek up to $1.1 billion from J&J over these claims.\n\nThe company\u2019s settlement plan has been receiving resistance almost as soon as it was announced. Now, the opposition of two major government departments against its completion could further impact the upcoming hearing.\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Watchdog Continues to Fight Against J&J Settlement\n\nWhile the objection from Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs is significant, it is not the first time a government department has fought against J&J\u2019s settlement plan.\n\nThe U.S. Trustee has repeatedly attempted to halt the settlement. This group is part of the Department of Justice and serves as the U.S. Government\u2019s bankruptcy watchdog.\n\nIt filed a motion to dismiss Red River Talc\u2019s bankruptcy in October and has now filed a new objection against the plan as well.\n\n\u201cThis is a case that was filed in bad faith by a shell entity that has no valid restructuring purpose or need for bankruptcy relief,\u201d the U.S. Trustee\u2019s objection stated. \u201cRather, the principal objective of these proceedings is to obtain a nonconsensual discharge of tort liabilities.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Trustee\u2019s issues with the settlement plan stem from J&J\u2019s use of the controversial Texas Two-Step Bankruptcy to complete it.\n\nIn this style of bankruptcy, a subsidiary takes on the primary company\u2019s liabilities and files for Chapter 11 in place of that company. J&J has tried this style of bankruptcy twice before and has not yet seen success.\n\nSettlement Holdouts Object to J&J\u2019s Plan\n\nWhile J&J has said it has significant support from talc plaintiffs in favor of completing the settlement, not all are on board.\n\nThe Coalition of Counsel for Justice for Talc Claimants, which represents settlement holdouts, continues to fight against the settlement. They have joined the long list of parties who have filed objections over the last few weeks.\n\nWhen J&J announced its settlement plan, it said that it had the support of about 83% of talc claimants. This easily exceeded the 75% approval rate required by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nBut, the holdouts\u2019 newly filed objection points out that the settlement would resolve tens of thousands of impacted lawsuits \u201cwithout the consent of all affected claimants.\u201d\n\nThe objection also references J&J\u2019s past failed attempts to settle its talc liabilities through this style of bankruptcy. J&J hopes to have more success in a new venue, with Red River Talc\u2019s case placed in front of a federal judge in Houston.\n\n\u201cTwo bankruptcies orchestrated by J&J to resolve the same liabilities \u2026 were found by the Third Circuit to have been filed in bad faith,\u201d the holdouts\u2019 objection stated. \u201cThe Debtor came to Texas to avoid the rulings that governed it and its predecessor.\u201d\n\nEditor Lindsay Donaldson contributed to this article.",

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ, Financial) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-02-11, Johnson & Johnson's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $127.10. It's currently trading at a price of $154.24. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -21.35%. The company is fair valued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Johnson & Johnson's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $9.99 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.52%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 6.50%\n\nYears of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4%\n\nYears of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 80.13 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 46.97 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 127.10\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $90.43. This valuation indicates that the Johnson & Johnson is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -70.56%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.\n\nHere are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\n\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\n\nThe DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\n\nGrowth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\n\nThe model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance.

Instead of Trump-proofing Illinois, maybe we need to Pritzker- and Johnson-proof it.\n\nIn Illinois and Chicago, Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson consistently make statements bemoaning President Donald Trump\u2019s return.\n\nThe governor is vowing to stand up for those with \u201cnew uncertainty about their future, scared that their rights will no longer be protected, and unsure whether this nation still stands with them.\u201d The mayor is promising to protect \u201cvulnerable communities\u201d from the new president\u2019s \u201chate\u201d and \u201cattacks.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Pritzker and Johnson see Trump as a political bogeyman they can use to leverage their own political fortunes. But their rhetoric is political fearmongering at its finest. Both the state and city are well equipped to protect people\u2019s \u201cfundamental rights\u201d and have policies in place to protect against government overreach, real or imagined.\n\nIllinois residents must not forget the conditions Pritzker and Johnson have brought upon the state of Illinois and city of Chicago. These conditions adversely impact the quality of life people wake up to every day. No amount of Trump bashing will hide the fact Chicago\u2019s and Illinois\u2019 governments are failing taxpayers.\n\nConsider the following\u2026\n\nChicago and Illinois are in financial crisis\n\nDespite almost $6 billion in federal COVID relief for the city, schools and transit system and having raised property taxes almost $1 billion, Chicago and Chicago Public Schools are each facing budget deficits approaching $1 billion next year. Not to be outdone, the state of Illinois also faces a $3.1 billion budget deficit next year and a projected $22 billion shortfall during the next five years \u2013 even after receiving over $54 billion in federal COVID funds and despite raising taxes by over $1 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Chicago\u2019s pension debt exceeds that of 43 states and Illinois leads the nation in debt. With the state facing serious financial challenges, Pritzker may want to consider what he says about his own practices.\n\nIllinois is among the highest-taxed states in the nation\n\nIllinois consistently ranks among the least tax-friendly states for middle-class families. The state has the second-highest property taxes in the nation, eighth-highest combined sales tax and above-average income taxes. WalletHub reported Illinois\u2019 low- to middle-income earners see the highest tax burden in the U.S. Yet, residents may face another round of taxes and fee hikes as Pritzker rushes to fill a significant budget shortfall during the next five years.\n\nChicago, the economic engine of the Prairie State, mandates residents pay among the highest property taxes, sales taxes, fees and fines in the country \u2013 with property taxes expected to soon rise substantially. The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy found Chicago businesses are burdened with the highest commercial property taxes among large cities.\n\nDespite boasting a progressive agenda, the state ranks last in equity\n\nA 2024 study by WalletHub ranked Illinois last in equity using eight basic economic measures of prosperity, including poverty rate, homelessness, labor force participation, homeownership, median annual household income and unemployment rate.\n\nIllinois\u2019 post-pandemic economic recovery has lagged the nation\n\nDespite Pritzker\u2019s upbeat outlook for the state economy, Illinois has experienced the slowest recovery from the pandemic and continues to lag in comparison to its Midwestern neighbors. Illinois has been near the bottom for state job growth for the past decade and what job growth there was came largely from government employment. The state has only 15,400 more jobs on net than were available in January 2020 before COVID-19 hit. All but 500 of the jobs came from the government.\n\nCrime is on the rise across Illinois and Chicago\n\nIllinois has the third-highest rate of robbery among all states, the highest in the Midwest and ranks second in the region for its murder rate. Chicago remains one of the most violent cities, leading the nation in murders and mass shootings. If Chicago were a state, it would be second only to California in mass shootings.\n\nIn 2023, Illinois implemented the SAFE-T Act, the first ever statewide pre-trail release program. With nebulous and confusing or hard-to-implement language, the SAFE-T Act could be improved by amending it to make it easier to detain anyone who attacks, threatens or intimidates victims, witnesses or first responders.\n\nIllinois spends the most yet gets the least from its public schools\n\nAccording to recent Nation\u2019s Report Card results, fewer than one-third of Illinois public school children are proficient in reading and math. This despite spending $43.6 billion on education in 2024, up from $35 billion in 2019, and employing some of the highest-paid teachers in the U.S.\n\nPeople are voting with their feet\n\nIllinois is experiencing the largest exodus of residents in the nation, behind only California and New York. Illinois was one of only three states to see its population shrink from 2010 to 2020. Chicago\u2019s population is the same as it was 100 years ago in 1920, with a large spike in departures by Chicago\u2019s Black residents \u2013 overwhelmingly middle-income families with children. While there was a 14% decline in the city\u2019s Black population from 2000 to 2020, the number of Black children, age 17 and younger, fell by 49%. The main reasons people move are lower cost of living and better jobs.\n\nUnlimited illegal migration seems to be the state and city solution for population loss\n\nPritzker, Johnson and The Far Left see unlimited illegal migration as the solution to Illinois\u2019 and Chicago\u2019s historic population exodus, going as far as refusing to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to arrest known criminals. The Center for Immigration Studies reports 530,000 illegal migrants have come to the state through Illinois\u2019 sanctuary state status and Chicago\u2019s sanctuary city policies. Chicago has spent more than $400 million on the migrant crisis since 2022, with Illinois spending at least $478 million.\n\nPritzker and Johnson would rather pay billions to attract migrants than change policies that lead to the high crime, high taxes and bad schools that caused over 1 million residents to leave in the first place.\n\nPritzker and Johnson can keep trying to make the new Trump Administration the villain, but they certainly won\u2019t see a federal government willing to send another $54 billion to temporarily rescue them from their fiscal mismanagement. Illinois residents should expect state and local taxes, which went up during the pandemic despite the massive federal bailout, to rise even more under the state and city finger-pointers-in-chief.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company that started in the early 1870s. Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

According to her, this cancer is one of the leading causes of death in men and is often missed during the early stages due to a lack of proper testing.\n\nPharmaceutical Executive: Can you discuss the Blue Jacket Fashion Show?\n\nBiljana Naumovic: We have been involved in the Blue Jacket Fashion Show now for almost a decade. It is part of our dedication to the prostate cancer community and is a very unique program that brings forward the discussion around prostate cancer and the need to diagnose early in an unconventional way, but way that is necessary in order for us to freely talk and to normalize the discussion around the needs to diagnose and to treat prostate cancer. It is also something that we strive to do. We have been committed to get in front of cancer at Johnson & Johnson, where we have an ambition to transform the way cancer is treated. The vision we have set for ourselves is to ultimately eliminate cancer, one cancer type at a time. One of the ways that we can attack that is to get in front of cancer very early on, while also supporting the communities that are more gravely affected by prostate cancer, like African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latino communities, and supporting them in diagnosis. That\u2019s what Blue Jacket Fashion Show is all about.\n\nPE: Do you think that the pharma industry needs to take more unconventional steps to reach underserved communities?\n\nNaumovic: For some things, absolutely yes. Especially around support for early diagnosis and helping people talk about how they can get tested and diagnosed on time. The biggest problem that we have in general is that people get diagnosed too late. There is a stigma that exists in prostate cancer, especially around discussing prostate cancer and getting the tests that are needed early on. I think being unconventional about this supports people in understanding that this really has to be normalized, and we have to take care of our health before it becomes disease.\n\nPE: Which communities are most underserved in prostate cancer?\n\nNaumovic: When you look at prostate cancer overall, it is the second highest incidence of cancer in men. It is also one of the cancer types with increasing incidence in the United States. Within the African American community, the incidence of prostate cancer is about 70% higher in black men versus white men. In the Hispanic community, this is the most common cancer diagnosis among Hispanic men with around 23,000 patients in this community being diagnosed per year in the United States. For Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, the diagnosis rates are not as early as they should be. These are some of the things that are relevant to be understood so that we can address every community in the way that they need to be addressed.",

Download the app.\n\nAt first glance, they might not have been considered a dream team. Breezy Johnson is on the comeback from a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency whereabouts violation, and Shiffrin is working through the mental challenges of a crash on November 30. A puncture wound in that violent crash came within millimeters of a devastating injury. Just last week, Shiffrin had no plans to compete in the team combined.\n\nBut Johnson and Shiffrin worked like a dream in the FIS Alpine World Championship\u2019s debut team combined race. Skiing consistently, the Americans held off Switzerland\u2019s Wendy Holdener, who brought the Swiss team to the silver-medal position after Lara Gut-Behrami finished twelfth in downhill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired by this event actually, which is something a little bit unanticipated,\u201d Shiffrin said after the win. \u201cThe vibe around it, teaming up and feeling like we\u2019re doing it together was so cool.\u201d\n\nA Bond Formed As Kids\n\nWhile the coaches made the team combined pairings just two days ago\u2014matching the top downhill skier with the top slalom skier based on season-best results\u2014Shiffrin and Johnson began working as a team over 15 years ago.\n\nThey first met as middle schoolers at the Whistler Cup in the late 2000s (a top international race for youth skiers). The kids ski individually, but their results help their nations win the team trophy (the Whistler Cup). Then in 2010, Shiffrin and Johnson were two of only three American girls competing at the 2010 Trofeo Topolino in Italy (renamed the Alpecimbra FIS Children\u2019s Cup in 2016). It was Shiffrin\u2019s first time competing in Europe; exactly a year later, she would make her World Cup debut.\n\nAfter Johnson won the 2025 downhill world championship title last week, she told Shiffrin: \u201cIf you want to do the TC, I would be honored to pair with you, not because of the medal, but because this sport is crazy fun, and it would be fun to bring it full circle after all these years,\u201d Shiffrin posted on social media. She also posted a photo of the two women riding a chairlift together.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been roommates, competitors, friends,\u201d Shiffrin continued. \u201cAnd she\u2019s right\u2026it will be so so cool to bring this full circle.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s Downhill\n\nShiffrin praised Johnson for her comeback\u2014and downhill world title\u2014after several challenging years. A medal favorite going into the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games, Johnson had to miss those Games with a knee injury. Then, last May, she received a 14-month suspension from USADA for missing three drug tests in 2022 and 2023. Her suspension ended right before the 2024 Beaver Creek World Cup in December. Before that race, she had to train for months on her own.\n\n\u201cBreezy\u2019s had to take on a lot on her own,\u201d said Shiffrin. \u201cThen she won the downhill [on Saturday] and then to go out and do it today, again, after everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won gold and you could have said, \u2018Yeah, like, I\u2019m good. Peace out,\u2019\u201d Shiffrin said to her friend. \u201cBut you\u2019re like, \u2018No, let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey would be Team USA1.\n\nJohnson was fourth in the team combined downhill, just over a half-second behind teammate Lauren Macuga (USA2), who handily won that portion of the team combined (fresh from a bronze medal in the world championship super-G five days ago). Would one of these two teams win?\n\nShiffrin\u2019s Seventh World Championship\n\nLast week, Shiffrin did not see the team combined in her future. She used every moment to regain form in both slalom and giant slalom. But the latter was not there yet.\n\n\u201cI feel like my skiing, technically is good, but I\u2019m blocked, like mentally blocked in being able to get to the next level of pace and speed and putting power into the turns [in GS],\u201d Shiffrin said the night before the team combined. \u201cThat mental, psychological-like, PTSD-esque struggle is more than I anticipated.\u201d\n\nShe dropped the GS from her world championship schedule and decided to compete in the team combined. She would not be \u201cfiring on all cylinders yet,\u201d she said. But she hoped that competing in the team combined might give her \u201cthis little glimmer of hope that we can do this, and this could be fun, this might not be so scary, must maybe this is going to be fun,\u201d she realized. \u201cHearing Breezy talk about it too has convinced me that we really have potential to have a good time on our little Team Atomic USA.\u201d\n\nSkiing fourth from last\u2014in reverse order of the morning\u2019s downhill results\u2014Shiffrin skied more like herself, rock steady, consistent, quick on her edges, just not moving down the hill at her normal Mach 1. But her time (third fastest in slalom) bumped USA1 up to first place.\n\nAnd there they stayed, watching the Austrians and the Germans falter. Then, crushingly, Paula Moltzan skied a conservative run and put USA2 into fourth place, just off the podium.\n\nAsked if they ever envisioned winning a world championship together when they were kids, Johnson laughed.\n\n\u201cWe probably were young and dumb enough to believe that we would be Olympic champions or something,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cBut you don\u2019t really know what that takes until you get into it. But yeah, to be world champions together is pretty crazy.\u201d\n\nThe team of Jackie Wiles and Katie Hensien finished tenth (with Hensien skiing the fourth fastest slalom), and Lindsey Vonn and AJ Hurt came in 16th.\n\nShiffrin\u2019s Historic Medal Count\n\nWith the team\u2019s combined win, Shiffrin now has eight world championship gold medals\u2014a record in the modern era (defined as post-World War II, with world championships held every other year). With 15 total world championship medals, Shiffrin is tied with Cristl Cranz for the most ever.\n\nCranz won 15 world championship medals in slalom, downhill, and combined events from 1934 to 1939. The world championships were held annually from 1931 to 1939.\n\nShiffrin will compete in women\u2019s slalom on Saturday and, even not \u201cfiring on all cylinders,\u201d is a strong favorite to earn a 16th world championship medal.\n\nAs For The Team Combined \u2026\n\nAs for the team combined, it\u2019s the latest iteration of Alpine\u2019s original Olympic medal event\u2014a combination of results in a downhill and slalom. But now, instead of one skier competing in both races, it allows a speed specialist to team up with a tech guru\u2014key in an age where racers are becoming more specialized. The combined total at the 2022 Olympics was only 27 men and 26 women participants, down from 65 men and 32 women at the 2018 Games.\n\nIn 2023, the IOC announced that a team combined \u2014 with one racer competing in downhill and another doing one run of slalom \u2014 would be on the 2026 Olympic program. The event had trial runs at the 2023 and 2024 junior world championships, then made its senior world championship debut in Saalbach this year.\n\nThe skiers reveled in the camaraderie of the new event. Taking a cue from cross-country skiing\u2019s Jessie Diggins, the U.S. women had red, white, and blue glitter on their cheeks. Other teams sported leis and headbands with their country\u2019s colors.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d said Katie Hensien. \u201cI think we should have done it a long time ago. I went to college, so know what it\u2019s like skiing for a team. It\u2019s fun to bring it to a world championship.\u201d\n\n\u2026And an Olympics next year.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company that started in the early 1870s. Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks To Buy For Financial Stability. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other best stocks to buy for financial stability.\n\nInvesting in stocks is one of the most effective ways to build long-term financial stability. While stocks can be volatile in the short term, history has shown that they generate higher returns over time compared to other asset classes. With the right strategy, investing in stocks can help individuals accumulate wealth, hedge against inflation, and secure a comfortable retirement. Stocks have historically outperformed other investment vehicles, such as bonds and savings accounts. According to data from the S&P 500, the stock market has delivered an average annual return of about 10% before inflation over the past century. In contrast, bonds have yielded around 5\u20136%, while traditional savings accounts provide returns of less than 1% annually. Recent studies reinforce this trend. A 2024 report from JP Morgan Asset Management found that over any 20-year period, the likelihood of losing money in the stock market is close to zero. Even with market downturns, those who stay invested tend to see significant growth.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe power of compounding is a key reason why investing in stocks enhances financial stability. The earlier an individual starts investing, the greater the impact of compounding. For example, if an investor puts $5,000 annually into an index fund earning 8% per year, they would accumulate approximately $1.3 million over 40 years. This long-term growth potential allows individuals to plan for major life events, such as purchasing a home, funding education, or retiring comfortably. The US Federal Reserve reports that individuals with investment portfolios of at least $100,000 are significantly more likely to achieve financial security than those relying solely on savings. While stocks can be volatile, diversification helps reduce risk. A well-balanced portfolio containing stocks from different sectors, as well as international investments, can mitigate losses during market downturns.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we scoured investing forums, analyst reports, and advice from money managers and billionaires to compile a list of stock options that can provide financial stability to investors. These stocks belong to defensive sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and energy. Many of these companies have solid dividend histories and enjoy a stable market position. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).",

Courtesy/Analine Johnson\n\nIn an emotional event, Analine Johnson, LBJ 9th Grade School library media specialist, was recently surprised by students, administrators, teachers and community members who gathered to congratulate her on recently receiving the I Love My Librarian award from the American Library Association.\n\nJohnson was brought into the school lobby last week, where some students held signs that read \"We Love Our Librarian.\" Cheerleaders formed a barrier for her to walk through, the band played drums, and teachers handed her flowers.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe I Love My Librarian award invites library users to recognize the accomplishments of exceptional public, school, college, community college or university librarians.\n\nEach year, up to 10 librarians are selected. Johnson beat out more than 1,000 nominations nationwide for the coveted award.\n\nVeronica Garza, LBJ 9th Grade School associate principal, said they were there to celebrate an exceptional individual \u2014 Analine Johnson, recipient of the prestigious I Love My Librarian award.\n\n\u201cThis award is a testament to your dedication, passion and the profound impact you've had on our Wolf Pack community,\u201d she said. \u201cYour tireless commitment to fostering a love of reading, your unwavering support for students and staff and the way you've transformed our library into a space of discovery and inspiration have not gone unnoticed.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cIt's no surprise that your excellence has been recognized on such a grand scale.\u201d\n\nGarza said this award not only honors Johnson\u2019s incredible contributions but also serves as an inspiration to others in the field.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of all of us, congratulations on this well-deserved honor. We celebrate you today and look forward to seeing the continued impact you have in the years to come. Wishing you all the best today and always,\u201d she said.\n\nReconnecting with Johnson\n\nJohnson, who was not expecting this form of celebration, was also surprised by a former Centeno Elementary School student, Priscilla Saray Garibay, who said Johnson was a very important person during a difficult time in her life.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nGaribay said she recently tried to reconnect with Johnson through social media.\n\n\u201cIf anyone, ANYONE, knows who I'm talking about, please let me know if I can maybe get in contact with her. I\u2019d love to personally thank her for her help. She doesn't know what I was going through at that time. She showed me love, she showed me books and more books. \u2026 She showed me the kindness I really needed,\u201d reads a post in the Facebook group Mommy and Me.\n\nGaribay said she wanted to locate Johnson and wondered what had happened to her because she had truly made a difference in her life.\n\n\u201cAnd I'll never forget when she gave me like a whole bunch of books. I think I was moving from fifth grade to sixth grade, but she gave me so many books. It was so great, and I even have some of those books to this day.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nGaribay said she was living in Kentucky when her father was first imprisoned and then deported and that she and her family lived in Mexico for some time to be near him.\n\n\u201cMy mother was barely in her 20s with a bunch of little kids, and we followed him and lived in Mexico for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cThen, because we were waiting to get Section 8 and food stamps, we came back, but we were homeless. The first house we lived in in Laredo, with the help of Section 8, was the one near Centeno Elementary, where Johnson was the librarian.\u201d\n\nGaribay said that because of her situation, she had a hard time socializing, so she spent all day in the library.\n\n\u201cI would spend all of my time in the library, like any off time that the teachers would let me have to the library,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I loved just hanging out with Johnson. She was so helpful, especially when I was into book series. She would go above and beyond, even reaching out to other schools to see if they had a specific book or ordering it herself. And it was just my favorite thing.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cOf all the schools I've been to and all the teachers I've met, she's always had a special place in my heart.\u201d\n\nGaribay said Johnson truly deserves this award.\n\n\u201cI am really happy to be here. Congratulations, Ms. Johnson,\u201d she said.\n\nRita Moreno, another former student and now Johnson\u2019s coworker, was also there to congratulate her.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cOne of my earliest memories of Johnson was probably in kindergarten,\u201d she said. \u201cShe read me \u2018The Very Hungry Caterpillar\u2019 for my birthday. And she read it in front of my whole class. I didn't have as much happiness going into the libraries at other schools because she made it so fun to just be in the library all the time.\u201d\n\nMoreno said she reconnected with Johnson last year when she started working at the Alexander 9th Grade Campus library.\n\n\u201cIt's been such a blessing to work with Johnson again,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has inspired me so much, and I now want to pursue a certification in education, specifically because of Johnson.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to affect someone just like Johnson affected me from a young age. She really changed my life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nJohnson still keeps photos of Garibay and Moreno as students visiting her in the library.\n\nLibrarians: an extension of the classroom\n\nCelia Taboada, UISD director of staff development and library services, said Johnson represents all librarians in the city and the region.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely proud of all the efforts she has made throughout the years, and this national recognition is a recognition of all her hard work and everything that she does for our community.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cHer dedication goes beyond the four walls of a school. She has been a great mentor to many students and has worked for a long time in support of the community.\u201d\n\nTaboada said librarians are an extension of the classroom in the library, working together with teachers and providing more resources to support student learning.\n\n\u201cThe librarians also instill the love of reading, not only for their studies but so that they learn about other subjects and have a broader perspective of the world,\u201d she said. \u201cAgain, congratulations to Miss Johnson because wherever she has been, she has left her mark.\u201d\n\nJohnson said she has spent the last 25 years with United ISD, and they have always been very supportive of all library initiatives and campaigns.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cWe've got to keep our library assistants, which are so important right now. Libraries provide so many resources for our students,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's beyond books. We do so much more. We're extensions of the classroom, so I'm extremely grateful to be with you.\u201d\n\nShe said she had just returned from the I Love My Librarian award ceremony and was very grateful to receive the award.\n\n\u201cI came back with a new commitment to do more for my community,\u201d she said. \u201cIt impacted me so much, and I want to make sure other librarians see that their work is valued as well. We may not all be recognized, but we all do this work every day, and it doesn't just stop when we go home.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad",

All three of the Bears' divisional rivals finished with at least 11 wins on the season, with the Lions taking the top seed in the NFC and O'Connell leading Minnesota to the playoffs with veteran Sam Darnold enjoying a resurgent year.\n\nIn New Orleans for Super Bowl LIX week, O'Connell took time to speak with CHGO on the Bears' hiring of Johnson, and revealed that, even as opponents, the two coaches would text each other about specific plays.\n\n\"It's not even a secret anymore, we're all watching each other, I remember getting a text from him [Johnson] about a play, I'd text him about a play, whatever it was,\" O'Connell said. \"But I'll tell you this, what they did offensively, I know Jared Goff really well, he's a fantastic quarterback, but what they did [in Detroit] and just how well it was put together. It's fundamentally sound, it's systematically sound, but it's also the next level now. They're challenging the barriers of what people thought could be possible to do, with really good players, Ben is fantastic.\"\n\nGiving credit to his own defensive coordinator Brian Flores, O'Connell said the battle between Flores and Johnson was fascinating to watch, not only because of the players, but the talent of both coaches.\n\nThe NFC North is certainly going to be an even more exciting division with Johnson's arrival in Chicago, and each game in the division could be a brilliant battle of the minds.",

The pregame show aired an AI video of the former Dallas Cowboys' head coach and Pro Football Hall of Famer.\n\nIt sent the internet into a tailspin, wondering if Johnson would be joining his colleague, Terry Bradshaw, in retirement after Super Bowl 59.\n\nA clearly emotional Johnson was seen crying on the set towards the end of the segment, one that lacked plenty of context. With Johnson's future suddenly facing plenty of uncertainty, it'll soon become a major talking point heading into the offseason.\n\nHere's what to know about Johnson and his future.\n\nIs Jimmy Johnson retiring?\n\nAs of now, there has been no word on Johnson's potential retirement. It's also unclear if he is battling some sort of illness, leaving more questions than answers after the bizarre Super Bowl pregame segment.\n\nThe crew almost eulogized a living Johnson during the broadcast, reminiscing about previous moments they had with the coach.\n\nHowever, when asked if this was goodbye for Johnson, he replied to host Curt Menefee, \"One day at a time, Curt.\"\n\nThe broadcast went to commercial without incident, meaning fans will be searching for answers heading into the offseason.\n\nJohnson has been a fixture for the NFL on Fox since joining the network in 1994.",

            "content": "At least half a dozen customers who purchased Band-Aid products have filed a class-action lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson and global consumer health company Kenvue for selling bandages that contain harmful PFAS chemicals.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Jersey, claims that while Band-Aid products are marketed as having better ingredients and better processes, PFAS \u2014 or forever chemicals \u2014 are present in unsafe amounts in Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages.\n\nMoreover, the lawsuit alleges that a disproportionate number of Band-Aid OURTONE products specifically marketed to people of color contain PFAS chemicals, raising questions about disparity.\n\nThe lead plaintiff in the case, a Georgia resident, \u201cwould not have purchased the bandages, or would have paid less for them, had she known that they contained and/or had a material risk of containing dangerous PFAS,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\n\n\u201cThese companies spent time positioning it as a step toward empowering people of color, but in reality it puts these communities at risk,\u201d said Seeger Weiss attorney Chris Ayers, co-lead class counsel in the suit.\n\n\u201cIf these communities are being exposed to PFAS, it really adds to the burden of health inequities that already exist,\u201d said Ayers.\n\nKenvue, which started as a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson but became fully independent in 2023, defended the safety of Band-Aid products in a company statement sent Friday to NJ Advance Media.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the filing and will respond further to the claims as part of the legal process,\u201d the statement begins. \u201cBAND-AID\u00ae Brand Adhesive Bandages are safe, and consumers can continue to use the products as directed.\u201d\n\nJohnson & Johnson, a leading U.S. drugmaker and one of the world\u2019s largest corporations, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBoth companies maintain global headquarters in New Jersey. Both companies stand accused of knowingly concealing the presence of PFAS in certain Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages.\n\nPFAS are widely-used, long-lasting chemicals which break down very slowly over time. In regard to bandages, the PFAS chemicals are used for their waterproof qualities, according to the suit.\n\nHowever, scientific studies have shown that exposure to some PFAS in the environment may be linked to harmful health effects in humans and animals, according to the United States Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nPFAS have been linked to cancer, immune system issues and other health effects, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn recent years, consumers have become more concerned about products containing PFAS chemicals, such as nonstick cookware and stain resistant fabrics. Now, PFAS contaminants have been found in bandages, the lawsuit claims.\n\nThe class-action lawsuit alleges an independent study conducted by the watchdog group Mamavation on indications of PFAS in popular bandages marketed to consumers found 63% of bandages marketed to people of color with black and brown skin tones had indications of PFAS.\n\nOf the four bandage products manufactured by Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the three OURTONE products of the Band-Aid brand are marketed to people of color with black and brown skin tones, the suit states.\n\n\u201cMillions of Americans have trusted Band-Aid products to help them heal and they never imagined that they contained these harmful, toxic chemicals,\u201d said Ayers.\n\nSince litigation is just getting underway, Ayers said, there\u2019s still time for eligible customers to contact their attorney or Seeger Weiss directly to join the class-action lawsuit.\n\nThe number of plaintiffs is likely to rise, said Ayers.\n\nThis is not the first time Johnson & Johnson has been accused of marketing a dangerous product as completely safe. In June, the company agreed to pay $700 million spread across 43 states to settle allegations it deceptively marketed talcum powder products as safe for women.\n\nNew Jersey was part of the lawsuit that alleged Johnson & Johnson marketed Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder as safe for daily use, including around the genitals, while knowing that studies and other information showed that the products were occasionally tainted with asbestos.\n\nJohnson & Johnson was also part of a landmark $26 billion nationwide settlement for its role in the opioid addiction crisis.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

Multiple jury verdicts against Johnson & Johnson suggest the average settlement for talcum powder lawsuits could be substantial.\n\nOur talcum powder lawsuit lawyers have access to volumes of scientific studies aimed at answering, \u201cDoes talc cause cancer?\u201d We are fighting to get fair compensation for women who developed ovarian cancer or mesothelioma after using Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder, Shower to Shower, and other talc-based products.\n\nWhy Use Our Law Firm for Your Talc Powder Lawsuit?\n\nOur firm has been involved in the talcum powder lawsuits since day one. Levin Papantonio Attorney Chris Tisi was appointed to serve as a member of the Plaintiffs\u2019 Steering Committee (PSC) in the national talc multidistrict litigation.

We are considered an authority in mass tort lawsuits. Our law firm has secured over 150 jury verdicts of $1 million or more and achieved verdicts and settlements totaling more than $80 billion.

Check back on a monthly basis for Johnson & Johnson lawsuit update 2023.\n\nMarch 2025 Talcum Powder Lawsuits Updates\n\nClosing arguments were presented in a Houston bankruptcy trial regarding Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talc litigation, with U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez presiding. Both sides made their case on whether the company\u2019s bankruptcy plan should be approved. Read more about the trial here.\n\nFebruary 2025 Talcum Powder Lawsuits Updates\n\nThe talcum powder multidistrict litigation (MDL) has stalled, with only one new case filed in January. This follows a similar slowdown in December, which saw just four new filings. The total number of pending cases now stands at 58,206. The current bankruptcy proceedings have put a stop to litigation. All focus is now on a major hearing in mid-February. This hearing could decide the next steps in the case.\n\nJanuary 2025 Talcum Powder Lawsuits Updates\n\nA Pittsburgh jury delivered a mixed verdict in a recent talc trial against Johnson & Johnson (J&J). While jurors ruled that the plaintiff\u2019s mesothelioma was not caused by J&J\u2019s talc products, they still awarded $22 million in punitive damages\u2014a highly unusual outcome.\n\nThe jury found J&J negligent and misleading in its safety claims. However, they did not prove a direct link between talc and the plaintiff\u2019s illness. The decision to impose punitive damages despite no liability for the illness itself suggests that jurors were troubled by J&J\u2019s corporate conduct. Although the award may not stand under procedural rules, this verdict signals significant skepticism toward J&J\u2019s defense strategy as talc litigation continues.\n\nDecember 2024 Talcum Powder Lawsuits Updates\n\nIn December 2024, Senator Elizabeth Warren brought back the Nondebtor Release Prohibition Act. This act aims to stop controversial bankruptcy tactics. One tactic is the \u201cTexas Two-Step,\u201d which companies like Johnson & Johnson use to protect themselves from liabilities. The bill also seeks to undo Purdue Pharma\u2019s bankruptcy decision, aiming to prevent companies from avoiding accountability for harm. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s baby powder lawsuits are on hold until March 2025. The company is looking for a bankruptcy solution. Progress on the related MDL has slowed down. Only three new cases were filed in November.\n\nNovember 2024 Talcum Powder Lawsuits Updates\n\nIn November 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice objected to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s choice of Jones Day as counsel for its subsidiary in a bankruptcy case, citing a conflict of interest related to the \u201cTexas Two-Step\u201d tactic. This tactic involves creating a subsidiary to handle liabilities, shielding the parent company from lawsuits. Additionally, the Talcum Powder MDL added 146 new cases in October, bringing the total number of pending cases to 58,198.\n\nOctober 2024 Talcum Powder Lawsuits Updates\n\nIn October 2024, Johnson & Johnson faced legal challenges over its bankruptcy strategy and mesothelioma cases. A judge will decide in January 2025 whether to approve J&J\u2019s bankruptcy plan to resolve lawsuits. In Connecticut, J&J was ordered to pay $15 million in a mesothelioma case, while a jury deliberated on a similar case seeking $30 million. The talcum powder MDL added 115 new cases, bringing the total to over 58,000. J&J won a ruling to continue its bankruptcy efforts in Texas, despite controversy over the venue choice.\n\nSeptember 2024 Talcumn Powder Lawsuits Updates\n\nIn September 2024, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s bankruptcy strategy faced several challenges. The U.S. Trustee accused J&J of \u201cforum shopping\u201d by filing its bankruptcy in Texas instead of New Jersey, arguing it was trying to avoid unfavorable rulings. A Texas judge temporarily halted some lawsuits to address jurisdictional issues. J&J\u2019s talc subsidiary, Red River Talc, filed for bankruptcy with an $8 billion settlement plan, but there were concerns over a lack of information about payouts. The talc litigation continues, with new trials and cases added.\n\nAugust 2024 Talcum Powder Lawsuits Updates\n\nIn August 2024, Johnson & Johnson requested that a judge dismiss a proposed class action for medical monitoring for users of its talc-based products. Meanwhile, a South Carolina jury awarded $63 million in damages to a terminal lung cancer patient who claimed exposure to J&J\u2019s talc caused his mesothelioma. ote results were still pending for the latest talc settlement plan.\n\nJuly 2024 Talcum Powder Lawsuits Updates\n\nThis month, the International Agency for Resarch on Cancer (IARC)\u2013an agency affiliated with the World Health Organization\u2013announced it had reclassified talc as a probable cause of ovarian cancer. The decision validated what talc cancer plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys have been arguing for years.\n\nOn July 19, 2024, Reuters reported that a New Jersey judge on Friday rejected Johnson & Johnson\u2019s attempt to disqualify the law firm Beasley Allen from representing plaintiffs who claim they got cancer from the company\u2019s talc products. Judge John Porto of the New Jersey Superior Court ruled that J&J had not provided \u201cany credible basis\u201d for its claims that Beasley Allen partner Andy Birchfield had an unethical alliance with one of the company\u2019s former lawyers.\n\nJune 2024 Talcum Powder Lawsuits Updates\n\nOn June 11, 2024, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in the talc cancer MDL issued a statement cautioning other plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys to thoroughly review documents and digest the science before recommending their clients accept J&J\u2019s prepackaged Chapter 11 plan.\n\nOn June 20, 2024, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys published a list of more than 60 law firms that oppose the J&J prepack plan.\n\nMay 2024 Talcum Powder Lawsuits Updates\n\nOn May 22, 2024, plaintiffs initiated a class action lawsuit (Murphy et al. v. LTL Management Inc. et al., Case No. 3:24-CV-06320 (D. N.J.)) on behalf of women and families whose talc-cancer cases were delayed due to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (J&J) alleged manipulation of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nThe complaint asserts that the defendants fraudulently engaged in a scheme to transfer assets through two bad faith bankruptcy filings, aiming to limit their liability for talc claims. This maneuvering, according to the suit, caused a two-year delay in scheduled trials and other forms of resolution.\n\nEarlier in May, a groundbreaking study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology revealed a significant connection between the use of genital talc and an increased risk of ovarian cancer. The research indicates that this risk is higher for individuals who used talc powder frequently or over extended periods.\n\nOn May 1, 2024, mass tort firms Levin Papantonio and Beasley Allen Law Firm issued a letter to the legal community warning about Johnson & Johnson\u2019s \u201cprepackaged\u201d Chapter 11 proposal. Following two failed bankruptcy attempts, J&J is now directly seeking settlements from law firms for talc powder ovarian cancer lawsuits at reduced values.\n\nFor the settlement to be approved, 75% of plaintiffs, who developed mesothelioma or ovarian cancer from J&J\u2019s talc powder, must agree to the terms. LP Attorney Mike Papantonio and Beasley Allen Law Firm Attorney Andy Birchfield cautioned in a letter that J&J is attempting a \u201cballot-stuffing\u201d tactic to secure this supermajority vote. They claim J&J is trying to include weaker claims to sway the vote, avoiding a fair decision by those genuinely affected.\n\nNovember 2023 Talcum Powder Lawsuits Updates\n\nWith at least 18 talc-ovarian cancer trials scheduled in state courts for the upcoming year, the initiative seeks to empower lawyers to effectively navigate these legal proceedings. This talc litigation bootcamp is strategically timed ahead of an anticipated third bankruptcy filing by J&J\u2019s LTL Management subsidiary.\n\nThis move by the pharmaceutical giant is intended to further postpone ongoing and future talc trials related to talcum powder products liability litigation. Presently, over 50,000 plaintiffs involved in the multidistrict litigation (MDL) claim that J&J\u2019s talc products are responsible for the development of ovarian cancer among the claimants.\n\nJuly 2023 Talcum Powder Lawsuits Updates\n\nU.S. Chief Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan in the United States has rejected the second bankruptcy petition (Case No.: 23-12825) filed by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (J&J) subsidiary, LTL Management LLC. This decision has foiled J&J\u2019s strategy of utilizing Chapter 11 as a method to address approximately 50,000 lawsuits that assert the company\u2019s talc products were responsible for causing ovarian cancer among the claimants.\n\nThis legal action from J&J occurred shortly before a jury ruled in favor of a man who alleged developing mesothelioma due to prolonged use of Johnson\u2019s talc-based baby powder. Emory Hernandez Valadez, the plaintiff, testified during the trial that he would have refrained from using J&J\u2019s baby powder had the company informed him of asbestos contamination. Valadez was awarded $18.8 million in California, but the collection of the judgment is postponed due to J&J\u2019s bankruptcy defense strategy.\n\nWhat Do We Know About the Johnson & Johnson Talc Lawsuit?\n\nThe talc multidistrict litigation (MDL) against Johnson & Johnson (J&J) involves thousands of lawsuits related to their talcum powder products. As of June 2024, over 57,365 talcum powder lawsuits have been filed against J&J and consolidated in an MDL in New Jersey. These lawsuits allege that J&J\u2019s talc-based baby powder was contaminated with asbestos and caused consumers to develop cancer.\n\nAccording to the talcum powder lawsuits, J&J knew about the health risks of talc for over 40 years. The company chose not to tell women that the powder could cause cancer if it got into the lungs or vagina.\n\nJury Awards and Settlements in Talc Cancer Lawsuits\n\nSince 2014, at least 12 juries have awarded over $6.5 billion in damages to consumers who filed lawsuits against J&J, claiming its talc-based powders caused their cancers, according to data from Bloomberg News.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has experienced significant losses in jury trials like the Missouri verdict for ovarian cancer victims that ended up costing the company $2.1 billion. In June 2024, a person with mesothelioma\u2014a deadly cancer that affects a thin layer of tissue covering many internal organs\u2014won $260 million from an Oregon jury.\n\nIn May 2024, J&J proposed using a bankruptcy settlement plan to resolve talc-related ovarian cancer claims. This settlement plan would deprive victims to their right to a jury trial. The settlement plan would also seriously undercut claims for women who suffered significant damages from ovarian cancer.\n\nAdditionally, in January 2024, J&J tentatively agreed to a $700 million settlement with over 40 U.S. states regarding its talcum powder marketing.\n\nAsbestos in Talc Prompted Recall\n\nIn October 2019, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) recalled 33,000 bottles of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found small amounts of asbestos in a tested sample. Asbestos is a known cancer-causing substance, which led to the recall.\n\nDoes Baby Powder Cause Cancer?\n\nIARC, an international authority on cancer-causing substances, upgraded its classification of talc from a \u201cpossible\u201d ovarian carcinogen in 2006 to a \u201cprobable\u201d ovarian carcinogen in its 2024 review.\n\nThe debate over talc started many years ago. In the 1970s, scientists found talc particles in ovarian tumors. By 1982, Harvard researcher Daniel Cramer linked talcum powder to ovarian cancer, and he suggested that Johnson & Johnson should warn about these risks. Cramer has often served as an expert witness in cases against the company.\n\nCramer\u2019s research, along with other studies, showed that regular use of talcum powder might increase the risk of ovarian cancer. These studies typically compared women with ovarian cancer to those without it, asking them to recall their past use of talcum powder and other activities.\n\nResearchers concluded that regular perineal use of talc-containing products can increase a woman\u2019s risk of ovarian cancer by approximately 30%. The more often a woman uses talc powder, the more likely she will experience cancer.\n\nHow Does Talcum Powder Cause Ovarian Cancer?\n\nThe American Cancer Society suggests talcum powder might cause chronic inflammation in the genital area. This could happen if talc particles move up from the vagina through the uterus and into the fallopian tubes and ovaries. Besides coming into direct contact with the tissues, the powder might also reduce the effectiveness of some antibodies that help protect against cancer, which could increase the risk.\n\nIn 1999, the American Cancer Society recommended women use cornstarch-based products, and not talc-based products, for the genital area.\n\nThe Cost of Ovarian Cancer\n\nThe average cost of ovarian cancer treatment during the first year alone is nearly $100,000, according to WebMD. In the first month of treatment, about a third of these expenses occur, with most of the remaining costs happening in the next five months. This includes outpatient services like:\n\nChemotherapy ($52,700)\n\nInpatient services such as surgery and hospitalization after surgery ($30,708)\n\nPharmacy costs ($1,814)\n\nPatients also need to consider indirect costs that go beyond medical care. For example, patients may miss work due to treatment. Research shows that people undergoing cancer treatments like chemotherapy miss around 22 more workdays per year than those without cancer. If you can\u2019t work, you may lose income and work-based health insurance, meaning you have to pay your own premium.\n\nPlaintiffs in talcum powder lawsuits seek recovery of these costs, as well as other damages.\n\nAverage Settlement for Talcum Powder Lawsuits\n\nLawyers are often asked, \u201cHas anyone received money from talcum powder lawsuits?\u201d\n\nThe answer is, yes. Over the years, many juries have awarded substantial amounts in talc powder lawsuits.

The total award was $72 million, including $62 million in punitive damages.\n\nWhat Is Talc, and How Is It Used?\n\nTalc is a naturally occurring mineral used in many industries, like cosmetics, medicine, and food processing. Because it is found in so many products, people are worried about its potential health risks, especially its link to ovarian cancer.\n\nTalcum powder is a soft, white powder made from refined magnesium silicate. It\u2019s often used to absorb moisture and as a lubricant, and it\u2019s the main ingredient in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder and similar personal hygiene products for adults.\n\nPeople like using talcum powder because it can absorb bad smells and keep the skin dry. Many have used it on underwear, shoes, and after changing baby diapers. It\u2019s also used in condoms and diaphragms to reduce friction. Additionally, talc is found in many medical powders.\n\nWho Makes Talc Hygiene Products?\n\nWomen who use talcum powder on a frequent basis for personal hygiene have a 30% higher chance of getting cancer. The main talc products used for personal hygiene are:\n\nJohnson\u2019s Baby Powder by Johnson & Johnson\n\nShower to Shower by Valeant Pharmaceuticals\n\nBaby Magic Baby Powder\n\nIn August 2022, Johnson & Johnson said they would stop making talc-based baby powder in 2023 and use cornstarch instead. J&J stopped selling talc powder in the U.S. and Canada in 2020.\n\nScientific Studies Link Talc to Ovarian Cancer\n\nMultiple scientific studies have aimed to answer the question, \u201cDoes talc cause cancer?\u201d Here are some of the published findings:\n\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)\n\nIARC, a prominent international authority on carcinogenic substances, changed its 2006 classification of talc from a \u201cpossible\u201d ovarian carcinogen (Group 2B) to a more worrisome \u201cprobable\u201d ovarian carcinogen (Group 2A). The IARC\u2019s 2024 review of talc, which was last looked at in 2006, highlights serious concerns.\n\nJournal of Clinical Oncology\n\nIn early May 2024, this groundbreaking study revealed a strong link between the use of genital talc and an increased risk of ovarian cancer. The research shows that this risk is higher for individuals who used talc powder frequently or over long periods.\n\nInternational Journal of Gynecological Cancer \u2013 Talc Ovarian Cancer Exposure\n\nUsing talc increased the risk of ovarian cancer by 30\u201360% in almost all well-designed studies. The Attributable Risk was 29%. This means that stopping the use of talc could protect more than a quarter of women who might develop ovarian cancer. Studies that looked at how often and how long women used talc found that those who used it more had a higher risk.\n\nLive Science \u2013 Potential Talcum Powder Cancer Link\n\nDr. Daniel Cramer, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School and director of the OB/GYN Epidemiology Center at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, conducted one of the earliest studies to suggest a link between genital talc use in women and cancer of the ovaries. In his opinion, there is evidence from about two-dozen epidemiological studies for a significant association between genital talc use and ovarian cancer.\n\nEuropean Journal for Cancer Prevention \u2013 Critical Review of Talc & Cancer\n\nTalc, like asbestos, is a silicate that has been studied for its cancer risk. Over the past 25 years, many studies have found a link between talc powders used in the perineal area and ovarian cancer. The overall risk is about 1.3 times higher (with confidence intervals of 1.2-1.5), and these findings suggest that talc could cause cancer.\n\nAmerican Cancer Society \u2013 Risk Factors for Ovarian Cancer\n\nSome studies suggest a very slight increase in risk of ovarian cancer in women who used talc on the genital area.\n\nObstetrics and Gynecology \u2013 Talc Use & Ovarian Cancer\n\nA life-time pattern of perineal talc use may increase the risk for epithelial ovarian cancer.\n\nInternational Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology \u2013 Talc and Carcinoma\n\nResearchers examined tissue from patients with ovarian and cervical tumours. In both conditions, talc particles were found deeply embedded within the tumour tissue.\n\nLet Us Fight to Get You Compensation for Your Talcum-Powder-Caused Cancer\n\nOur law firm has served people who suffered injuries from corporate negligence since 1955.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company that started in the early 1870s. Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "There were a lot of hot contenders for the title of Downhill World Champion this Saturday, February 8, but it was an underdog who took the victory on the Zw\u00f6lferkogel course in Saalbach, Austria. USA\u2019s Breezy Johnson claimed victory ahead of home favorite Mirjam Puchner in second place and Czechia\u2019s Ester Ledecka in third place.\n\nU.S. Breezy Johnson had the honor of opening the Downhill race in bib,1 and the American, who had also shown strong results in the training runs, coming second twice and sixth once, leading up to the competition, set a fast pace\u2014as it turns out the fastest for the day. At a record speed of 138.5 kilometers per hour (86.5 miles per hour), Johsnons also managed to beat her own best training runs. The American crossed the finish line in 1:41.29 minutes, which was a time that proved to be impossible to beat.\n\nGermany\u2019s Kira Weidle-Winkelmann in bib 2 could not match the American\u2019s pace, crossing 1.64 seconds behind Johnson, leaving a big gap for other subsequent racers to slot into. Italy\u2019s Nicol Delago in bib 3 was the first such skier to squeeze into the gap, 0.76 seconds behind Johnson. While the Italian was faster on the top section, she did not quite get the maximum speed the American had achieved. Meanwhile, France\u2019s Laura Gauche finished almost a second behind Weidle-Winkelmann in what was ultimately 20th place.\n\nNext up was Czechia\u2019s Ester Ledecka in bib 5, who had been fastest in yesterday\u2019s training. The 2018 Olympic Super-G Champion was one of the wildcards for today. The Czech has the ability to rally at big events, and Ledecka was half a second ahead of Johnson on the top section, looking like she could take her first World Championship title. However, Ledecka lost time on the mid-section and skied across the finish line 0.21 seconds behind the American, in what was ultimately third place but second place at the time.\n\nSlovakia\u2019s Ilka Stuhec could not get close to Ledecka or Johnson, finishing 1.31 seconds behind the leader, while Austria\u2019s Cornelia H\u00fctter looked dangerously close with more than half a second lead on the top. Like Ledecka before her, however, the Austrian in bib 7 could not master the mid-section at the same pace as Johnson and finished 0.34 seconds behind Johnson in what was third at the time. However, her teammate Mirjam Puchner in bib 9 demoted her to what was ultimately fourth place with the second-fastest run of the day. Puchner, who had been strong in training, crossed the finish line just 0.15 seconds behind Johnson in second place. Puchner managed to stay low on the entire course, delivering her an aerodynamic and smooth run. The Austrian had a 0.16-second lead on Johnson on the top section but, like all the other skiers before her, could not quite carry the momentum into the bottom section.\n\nEagle-eyed readers might be wondering about bib 8: Lara Gut-Behrami recorded a DNF after the Swiss skier had looked strong on the top of the course. She made a mistake after a smaller roller on the course that ended her bid for Downhill glory on the mid-section. Norway\u2019s Kajsa Lie in bib 10, who had claimed an equal third place with Lauren Macuga in the Super-G, failed to endanger the top rankings, finishing behind Weidle-Winkelmann. The other Super-G medallists from Thursday, Federica Brignone in bib 14, Stephanie Venier in bib 15, and Lauren Macuga in bib 18, failed to shake up the top three ranking, despite strong runs on the Zw\u00f6lferkogel course. Other strong contenders for a podium, like Italy\u2019s Sofia Goggia in bib 12 or Switzerland\u2019s Corinne Suter, also failed to unseat Johnson.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Macuga deserves a special mention, as Thursday\u2019s Bronze medallist showed incredible form, taking the lead on the top section by 0.29 seconds. While she could not quite carry that speed into the mid-section, with the fifth fastest time on the high-speed section at 137.4 kilometers per hour (85.9 miles per hour), the 22-year-old finished the race a mere 0.38 seconds behind Johnson, cementing her reputation as a top podium contender in the speed disciplines this season. Teammate Jacqui Wiles, unfortunately, recorded a DNF, while Lindsey Vonn in bib 21 finished the World Championship in 15th place, just 0.01 seconds ahead of her good friend Goggia. Vonn had been struggling with the flu and skipped the course inspection today, however, still showed top form.\n\nWith most of the top podium contenders out of the way, Johnson\u2019s smile in the leader\u2019s seat in the finish area was growing wider and wider. The last wildcard to shake up things was Germany\u2019s Emma Aicher in bib 30, who was the only skier out of the last 12 skiers to come close to endangering Johnson\u2019s victory. The 21-year-old was leading by 0.34 seconds on the top section. She carried the top speed down into the jump but could not quite maintain the momentum into the bottom section, finishing 0.48 seconds behind Johnson in what was sixth place, 0.10 seconds behind Macuga.\n\nAs the last skier crossed the finish line, the incredible news sank in for Johnson, who started crying in the leader\u2019s seat in the finish area. While they were tears of joy, they showed the overwhelming emotions the 29-year-old was going through as the reality set in that she had just won her first-ever international race. With 104 World Cup and World Championship starts to her name and not a single victory, a slew of injuries, and a missed season due to a 14-month ban, Johnson\u2019s day had finally arrived. \u201cI came to Cortina for my second World Championships. I hip-checked and I won three splits, but that was not gonna work with a hip check, so I didn\u2019t walk away with a medal,\u201d Johnson said in an interview. \u201cThen I came into Meribel with the green light, and I fell, so it\u2019s been a long time coming. But if you keep trying, then maybe one day you\u2019ll get it.\u201d\n\nJohnson credited her team with her victory, emphasizing the strong team spirit in the U.S. Alpine team. \u201cWe try to build each other up, and we try to help each other, and I think that that typically breeds a fast ski environment,\u201d Johnson stressed, \u201cIt definitely breeds a happy ski environment,\u201d she added. Johnson\u2019s victory is the crowning moment thus far on a successful U.S. World Championship campagin, following Lauren Macuga\u2019s third place in the Super-G on Thursday, February 6, and Team USA\u2019s fourth place in the Team Parallel event on the opening day on Tuesday, February 4.",

            "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 1.42%) may be the most elite club in the stock market.\n\nThe vaunted index holds only 30 blue chip stocks, making it a great source if you're looking for reliable industry leaders that pay dividends. In fact, one time-tested investment strategy known as the Dogs of the Dow calls for buying stock in the 10 highest dividend-yielding Dow Jones stocks and rebalancing annually.\n\nLet's take a look at the three top Dow Jones Industrial Average dividend stocks to see if any are worth buying.\n\n1. Verizon: 6.9% dividend yield\n\nVerizon (VZ -1.04%) has long been the top dividend payer on the Dow and is a popular choice among dividend investors as it competes in a telecom triopoly with AT&T and T-Mobile in an industry with high barriers to entry.\n\nVerizon currently offers a dividend yield of 6.9%. However, the business has struggled to grow as T-Mobile has gobbled up market share, and Verizon's stock performance has been underwhelming. Over the last four years, the stock price is down 33%, though it has bounced off its low in 2023.\n\nThe company made a bad bet on C-band and millimeter wave spectrum that doesn't serve its 5G network well. It spent $52 billion on C-band network infrastructure, a move that allowed T-Mobile to grab market share.\n\nGrowth has been sluggish as operating revenue rose just 0.6% in 2024 to $134.8 billion, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) fell from $4.71 to $4.59.\n\nVerizon is acquiring Frontier Communications in order to improve its position in the broadband market and expand its fiber optic network, but it will come at a cost, and the company already has $118 billion in debt.\n\nGiven the company's lack of growth, market share losses, and debt burden, investors can find better dividend stocks elsewhere despite Verizon's high yield.\n\n2. Chevron: 4.6% dividend yield\n\nFollowing ExxonMobil's removal from the Dow in 2020, Chevron (CVX 1.84%) is the only oil major in the index.\n\nEnergy stocks are known for paying juicy dividends, and Chevron is no slouch in that department with a 4.6% dividend yield. However, the stock has also underperformed as oil and gas companies face declining oil consumption in much of the world due to environmental and fuel economy standards and the rise of alternatives like electric cars. Additionally, investors generally perceive it as a declining industry. Chevron stock is up 39% over the last five years, significantly underperforming the S&P 500, which is up 86%. Even with dividends reinvested, Chevron still loses.\n\nChevron continues to generate billions in free cash flow, though its adjusted EPS fell from $11.36 to $9.72. The company had a record year for production, but its profits are tied to the market price of oil over which it has little control.\n\nFor investors willing to stomach the cyclicality of the oil and gas industry, Chevron isn't a bad choice, but there are income stocks with better long-term prospects.\n\n3. Johnson & Johnson: 3.4% dividend yield\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.26%) is the safest of these three stocks. In fact, it's one of the safest stocks on the market, even after spinning off its consumer-products business, built around products like Tylenol and Band-Aid, into Kenvue.\n\nIt's one of only two U.S. stocks with a AAA credit rating from S&P Global -- the other being Microsoft. It's now focused on medical devices and pharmaceuticals following the Kenvue spin-off, and has made several acquisitions, including Shockwave Medical, Protelogix, and V-Wave.\n\nRevenue for 2024 rose 4.3% to $88.8 billion, and adjusted EPS rose 11% to $5.79. The company also touted significant progress in pipeline drugs Rybrevant and Lazcluze.\n\nLooking ahead, Johnson & Johnson called for 2025 operational sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and 8.7% growth in the adjusted EPS at the midpoint of its guidance of $10.75 to $10.95.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has the best growth opportunities of these three stocks, especially as it focuses on acquisitions, and it's the most recession-proof of the group as healthcare spending isn't generally sensitive to the overall economy.\n\nIf you're looking for a safe, stable dividend stock to own, Johnson & Johnson looks like a good choice.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company that started in the early 1870s. Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

J&J\u2019s internal testing confirmed this in the 1970s, but the company chose to hide this information from the public to protect its profits.\n\nAs a result, consumers across the country may have been exposed to asbestos and put at risk of developing cancer.

This mineral can become contaminated with asbestos fibers during the mining process, putting talcum powder users at risk.\n\n\u201cTalc used regularly in the genital area was associated with a 33% increase in ovarian cancer risk overall.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Journal of Epidemiology\n\nAt least three separate laboratories found asbestos in J&J\u2019s baby powder products throughout the 1970s \u2014 including one that reported \u201crather high\u201d levels of the carcinogen.\n\nDespite these findings and additional studies linking talcum powder to ovarian cancer, Johnson & Johnson refused to add warning labels to its products.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +7.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.9% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Johnson & Johnson belongs, has gained 6.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Johnson & Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.60 per share, indicating a change of -4.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.58 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.07 indicates a change of +4.6% from what Johnson & Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson & Johnson.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company that started in the early 1870s. Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He\u2019s the man behind the psychedelic stylings of the bands Wooden Shjips and Moon Duo.\n\nNow, Johnson\u2019s explorations have led him to form his newest group out of Portland, Oregon: Rose City Band. The music is influenced by Johnson\u2019s love of albums from the 1970s. Think Neil Young with reverberating echoes of the Grateful Dead and Gram Parsons.\n\nJohnson sat down with WPR\u2019s \u201cBETA\u201d resident musicologist Steve Gotcher to talk about the group\u2019s newly released fifth album, \u201cSol Y Sombra,\u201d the collective unconscious, and Johnson\u2019s ability to lean in to his influences to create something new.\n\nStay informed on the latest news Sign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter. Email Name This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nThe following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nRipley Johnson: I grew up on classic rock. My dad had a huge record collection that he mysteriously never seemed to listen to. Like, I have no memory of him ever putting a record on, but he must have had a thousand records.\n\nRadio, at the time when I was growing up, was a lot of classic rock, a lot of oldies. So that\u2019s something that I absorbed at a formative age. When I was in high school, I got more into psychedelic classic rock \u2014 stuff that was easily accessible at the time \u2014 Pink Floyd and the Grateful Dead and Neil Young.\n\nAnd so that\u2019s just sort of my foundation of my love for music. I got into denser, heavy droning kind of stuff in my 20s and that informed my early bands. And then as I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve just come back full circle to the music of my youth. And that\u2019s what I associate the Rose City Band stuff with more.\n\nRipley Johnson. Photo courtesy of Sanae Yamada\n\nSteve Gotcher: Were there any non-musical influences for this particular record?\n\nRJ: Yeah, I would say Carl Jung, of all things. (LAUGHS).\n\nI\u2019ve been doing Jung-ian psychotherapy in the last couple of years and I\u2019ve gotten sort of obsessed with his philosophy of the psyche and the unconscious. I have a dream journal and I do a lot of dream analysis. So the title \u201cSol Y Sombra\u201d \u2014 sun and shadow \u2014 sort of alludes to that. Our conscious mind, what we go through every day, our ego. And then there\u2019s the shadow. There\u2019s this big part of us that we only really glimpse in dreams. And so that has been something that\u2019s been preoccupying me for the last couple of years.\n\nAlbum cover for Rose City Band\u2019s \u201cSol Y Sombra.\u201d Image courtesy of Thrill Jockey Records\n\nSG: That\u2019s interesting. And the concept of the record certainly has that vibe to it. There\u2019s a lot of light and dark, and it just seems to be on the edge of falling apart totally. Yet it\u2019s so tight and clean. It\u2019s an amazing thing that you pulled off.\n\nRJ: Thank you. In my early bands, there was a lot of density, like you said. There\u2019s a lot of fuzz or distortion, which as a guitar players is wonderful because it\u2019s like surfing a sea. It supports you. And for this band, for some reason, I wanted to remove a lot of that and find a clarity. But it also leaves you very exposed. So it is a challenge for me as a musician.\n\nSG: And when I say falling apart, I mean in the sense that it would evolve into a psychedelic cacophony at some point, but it doesn\u2019t do that. Which is a cool thing because you\u2019re waiting for it to happen and it doesn\u2019t.\n\nRJ: Live, we have a lot of improvisational sections in our set. And there\u2019s always the possibility that things will fall apart. I think leaving room for that possibility is what enables you to create something potentially special on that night.\n\nOf course, you would never leave that on the record. You would excise that if it happens during the recordings.\n\nSG: Right. Otherwise, it\u2019d be a 10-volume set. So let\u2019s talk about the songs a little bit. And we spoke about the Grateful Dead a little bit ago. \u201cLights On the Way\u201d definitely has a Grateful Dead-feel. What were you going for with that track?\n\nRJ: I just try to open up and just let things come to me. That\u2019s sort of how I work as a songwriter. While we were recording it, I noticed these things. Like, this is sounds a little bit like this, a little bit like that. And you can\u2019t really run away from your influences. Sometimes I lean in and sometimes I lean back, you know?\n\nLou Reed somehow has gotten into my bones. And so the way I play rhythm is just very similar, I think, to things that he did. I hear the little bit of Grateful Dead stuff in it, but usually when I\u2019m creating, I don\u2019t notice those things. It\u2019s usually when I\u2019m recording, in retrospect.\n\nSG: You don\u2019t sound like the kind of person who\u2019s really trying to create your own particular sound. You\u2019re very willing to just lean into whatever is appealing to you at that time. Is that right?\n\nRJ: Yeah, and that\u2019s come to me later in life as I\u2019ve matured a bit. When I was younger, I think I was very contrary in general, and I think my music was always sort of a reaction to the culture, a reaction to things. And now I\u2019m trying to accept things as they are. I mean, everyone has their own unique things that they like. Even if we all share so many common things.\n\nAnd music is a language. That\u2019s why it means something to people. But I think if you just stay true to your little eccentricities, you end up coming up with something unique.\n\nSG: A few weeks ago, I talked with Joe Boyd. He\u2019s written a book recently about world music. And he was saying that there is no pure music. All music is a hybrid.\n\nRJ: Yeah. It\u2019s sort of like Jung would say, the collective unconscious. We\u2019re all pulling from the same things. This is why sometimes in scientific breakthroughs, people will invent the same thing on different parts of the globe.\n\nAt the same time, the same thing will be invented. You know, we\u2019re pulling things from this well of knowledge and culture that\u2019s thousands of years old. And you kind of have to just let it happen for the magic to be there.\n\nSG: The songs on the record move from melancholy to joyful. And you\u2019ve said that \u201cRose City Band\u201d tries to keep things light, but the darkness has crept in a little bit more this time. How do you feel about that?\n\nRJ: I feel really good about it, actually, because I think when I first started this project, it was in some ways a reaction to my other bands. It was all pretty heavy and dark. I needed to do something light for myself. And a balance has come in with this project, which I think is healthy.\n\nSG: The first \u201cRose City Band\u201d album was a bit of an enigma. It took you a while to even come forward as the guy behind the project. And it wasn\u2019t until after your third album arrived that the band performed anywhere live. Why is that?\n\nRJ: Part of it is the pandemic. When I made the second album, I actually made the record thinking about playing live. So a lot of the songs were geared toward that. And then the pandemic hit when it came out, so that put a pause on that. But the initial record, I wanted it to just exist in the world without being considered in the context of me and my past work.\n\nRose City Band. Photo courtesy of Thrill Jockey Records\n\nSG: This album is laid out in a very intentional way. Did you spend a lot of time thinking about how to sequence the songs on this record?\n\nRJ: Yes, always. I\u2019m a vinyl person, so I think about that. Like, what\u2019s the first song you\u2019re going to hear when you put the needle down on both sides? And also, I\u2019m a big side-B guy. I think it\u2019s fascinating when you look at the second side of LPs, because a lot of times it\u2019s the weirder songs. Often times for me, that\u2019s the most interesting, cooler stuff. We had some weirder songs for this record that weren\u2019t straightforward country rock or whatever. So I immediately thought, these songs are going to be on the second side and ease people into it.\n\nSG: You know, a lot of people who have a musical career start out a certain way and may move away. Like, Joni Mitchell moved away from folk music more into jazz and some other experimental things. Are you doing that or are you doing it simultaneously with all three bands?\n\nRJ: The \u201cRose City Band\u201d stuff is my main preoccupation right now. The other bands aren\u2019t really active, so I guess I am moving away from that stuff. I\u2019m on some kind of journey. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going, but yeah, there\u2019s definitely some sort of trajectory.",

According to her, this cancer is one of the leading causes of death in men and is often missed during the early stages due to a lack of proper testing.\n\nPharmaceutical Executive: Can you discuss the Blue Jacket Fashion Show?\n\nBiljana Naumovic: We have been involved in the Blue Jacket Fashion Show now for almost a decade. It is part of our dedication to the prostate cancer community and is a very unique program that brings forward the discussion around prostate cancer and the need to diagnose early in an unconventional way, but way that is necessary in order for us to freely talk and to normalize the discussion around the needs to diagnose and to treat prostate cancer. It is also something that we strive to do. We have been committed to get in front of cancer at Johnson & Johnson, where we have an ambition to transform the way cancer is treated. The vision we have set for ourselves is to ultimately eliminate cancer, one cancer type at a time. One of the ways that we can attack that is to get in front of cancer very early on, while also supporting the communities that are more gravely affected by prostate cancer, like African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latino communities, and supporting them in diagnosis. That\u2019s what Blue Jacket Fashion Show is all about.\n\nPE: Do you think that the pharma industry needs to take more unconventional steps to reach underserved communities?\n\nNaumovic: For some things, absolutely yes. Especially around support for early diagnosis and helping people talk about how they can get tested and diagnosed on time. The biggest problem that we have in general is that people get diagnosed too late. There is a stigma that exists in prostate cancer, especially around discussing prostate cancer and getting the tests that are needed early on. I think being unconventional about this supports people in understanding that this really has to be normalized, and we have to take care of our health before it becomes disease.\n\nPE: Which communities are most underserved in prostate cancer?\n\nNaumovic: When you look at prostate cancer overall, it is the second highest incidence of cancer in men. It is also one of the cancer types with increasing incidence in the United States. Within the African American community, the incidence of prostate cancer is about 70% higher in black men versus white men. In the Hispanic community, this is the most common cancer diagnosis among Hispanic men with around 23,000 patients in this community being diagnosed per year in the United States. For Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, the diagnosis rates are not as early as they should be. These are some of the things that are relevant to be understood so that we can address every community in the way that they need to be addressed.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) stock is up by a considerable 7.7% over the past month. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Johnson & Johnson is:\n\n20% = US$14b \u00f7 US$70b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.20 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Johnson & Johnson's Earnings Growth And 20% ROE\n\nTo start with, Johnson & Johnson's ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 19%. However, while Johnson & Johnson has a pretty respectable ROE, its five year net income decline rate was 3.0% . Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.\n\nSo, as a next step, we compared Johnson & Johnson's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 1.8% over the last few years.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Johnson & Johnson's's valuation, check out , as compared to its industry.\n\nIs Johnson & Johnson Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nJohnson & Johnson has a high three-year median payout ratio of 72% (that is, it is retaining 28% of its profits). This suggests that the company is paying most of its profits as dividends to its shareholders. This goes some way in explaining why its earnings have been shrinking. The business is only left with a small pool of capital to reinvest - A vicious cycle that doesn't benefit the company in the long-run.\n\nAdditionally, Johnson & Johnson has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 48% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 35% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we feel that Johnson & Johnson certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE. Bear in mind, the company reinvests a small portion of its profits, which means that investors aren't reaping the benefits of the high rate of return. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?\n\nIf you're looking to trade Johnson & Johnson , open an account with the lowest-cost platform trusted by professionals, Interactive Brokers.

Wendell Cruz-Imagn Images\n\nThe deadline came and went at 3 p.m. Thursday, and Johnson was still a Net. Starting center Nic Claxton and backup Day\u2019Ron Sharpe are, too, despite Sharpe drawing interest over the past week.\n\nOther front offices reached out to general manager Sean Marks, but none came up with a concrete offer to convince the Nets to move Johnson.\n\n\u201cIf I felt the need to go speak to him about something, or I catch wind of something that I want to bring up to [Marks], then I will,\u201d Johnson had told The Post. \u201cHe has a job to do. I have a job to do. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on right now.\n\n\u201cAnd right now, my job is to play for this team and to contribute to this team and to try to do all those things.

And [I\u2019m] going from there.\u201d\n\nJohnson isn\u2019t going anywhere \u2026 at least not this season.\n\nCHECK OUT THE LATEST NBA STANDINGS AND NETS STATS\n\nThe forward is enjoying a mid-career breakthrough, averaging 19.3 points on sterling .488/.417/.902 shooting splits.\n\nOn a team-friendly descending contract that will count just 13 percent against the salary cap the next two seasons, the Nets certainly could revisit moving Johnson on draft night or in the summer.\n\nNets GM Sean Marks stood pat at the NBA trade deadline. Noah K. Murray for New York Post\n\nAnd at just 28 years old, he\u2019s still young enough that he could be part of their team should they aim for a shorter rebuild.\n\nWhile some tank-happy fans wanted to see Johnson moved simply on the hopes of moving up in the lottery standings, Toronto\u2019s trade for Brandon Ingram could help the Nets catch the Raptors for fifth in the lottery odds.\n\nBut the Nets weren\u2019t shopping Johnson and were going to have to be offered a significant return to change their minds.\n\nThree second-round picks appeared to be the going rate for solid veterans, a point that was driven home several times at this deadline.\n\nClearly, Johnson has more value than that to the Nets.\n\nMarks \u2014 who has never picked inside the top 20 \u2014 spent Wednesday at Rutgers scouting three potential lottery picks.\n\nDylan Harper returned from injury with 28 points, and Ace Bailey added 18 points and 11 rebounds in RU\u2019s 82-73 win over Illinois.\n\nHarper helped hold Kasparas Jakucionis to just seven points and two assists on 2-for-8 shooting with three turnovers.\n\nIt was at least Marks\u2019 fifth trip to Piscataway.

Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "From what we can see, insiders were net sellers in Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ ) during the past 12 months. That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Johnson & Johnson\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Johnson & Johnson\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Global Corporate Affairs, Vanessa Broadhurst, for US$1.4m worth of shares, at about US$162 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$153. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern. Vanessa Broadhurst was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.\n\nThe chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nNYSE:JNJ Insider Trading Volume February 5th 2025\n\nI will like Johnson & Johnson better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nJohnson & Johnson Insiders Bought Stock Recently\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Johnson & Johnson. Independent Director Mark Weinberger spent US$147k on stock, and there wasn't any selling. That shows some optimism about the company's future.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Johnson & Johnson insiders own 0.04% of the company, worth about US$152m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Johnson & Johnson Insiders?\n\nThe recent insider purchase is heartening. But we can't say the same for the transactions over the last 12 months. The recent buying by an insider , along with high insider ownership, suggest that Johnson & Johnson insiders are fairly aligned, and optimistic. Of course, the future is what matters most.

            "content": "Biljana Naumovic, president of US Oncology Solid Tumor at Johnson & Johnson, spoke with Pharmaceutical Executive about her work with Johnson & Johnson to spread awareness around the importance of early diagnosis for prostate cancer. According to her, this cancer is one of the leading causes of death in men and is often missed during the early stages due to a lack of proper testing.\n\nPharmaceutical Executive: Can you discuss the Blue Jacket Fashion Show?\n\nBiljana Naumovic: We have been involved in the Blue Jacket Fashion Show now for almost a decade. It is part of our dedication to the prostate cancer community and is a very unique program that brings forward the discussion around prostate cancer and the need to diagnose early in an unconventional way, but way that is necessary in order for us to freely talk and to normalize the discussion around the needs to diagnose and to treat prostate cancer. It is also something that we strive to do. We have been committed to get in front of cancer at Johnson & Johnson, where we have an ambition to transform the way cancer is treated. The vision we have set for ourselves is to ultimately eliminate cancer, one cancer type at a time. One of the ways that we can attack that is to get in front of cancer very early on, while also supporting the communities that are more gravely affected by prostate cancer, like African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latino communities, and supporting them in diagnosis. That\u2019s what Blue Jacket Fashion Show is all about.\n\nPE: Do you think that the pharma industry needs to take more unconventional steps to reach underserved communities?\n\nNaumovic: For some things, absolutely yes. Especially around support for early diagnosis and helping people talk about how they can get tested and diagnosed on time. The biggest problem that we have in general is that people get diagnosed too late. There is a stigma that exists in prostate cancer, especially around discussing prostate cancer and getting the tests that are needed early on. I think being unconventional about this supports people in understanding that this really has to be normalized, and we have to take care of our health before it becomes disease.\n\nPE: Which communities are most underserved in prostate cancer?\n\nNaumovic: When you look at prostate cancer overall, it is the second highest incidence of cancer in men. It is also one of the cancer types with increasing incidence in the United States. Within the African American community, the incidence of prostate cancer is about 70% higher in black men versus white men. In the Hispanic community, this is the most common cancer diagnosis among Hispanic men with around 23,000 patients in this community being diagnosed per year in the United States. For Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, the diagnosis rates are not as early as they should be. These are some of the things that are relevant to be understood so that we can address every community in the way that they need to be addressed.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company that started in the early 1870s. Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The firm plans to file papers later this month at the High Court in London.\n\nJ&J has faced similar lawsuits in the US, where it has proposed multi-billion-dollar settlements while maintaining that its products do not cause cancer.

It is clear that lawyers are now seeking to exploit cancer patients and their families in the UK by spreading this same fear.\n\n\u201cDecades of testing by medical experts in the UK and around the world \u2026 demonstrates that the product is safe, does not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.\u201d",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson Under Fire Again as Legal Action Over Alleged Talc-Cancer Link Moves to the UK\n\nby Bernice Lottering Share To\n\nIn a major legal challenge, 3,500 claimants are preparing to sue Johnson & Johnson (J&J) in the UK over allegations that its talcum powder products caused cancer due to asbestos contamination. The lawsuit, set to be one of the largest pharmaceutical group actions in English and Welsh legal history, claims that J&J knowingly sold hazardous talc-based products, putting consumers at serious risk.\n\nBringing the Talc Lawsuit to the UK After Years of US Litigation\n\nThe legal firm KP Law, leading the case, asserts that J&J became aware as early as the 1970s that its talc contained asbestos but failed to issue warnings. Despite these concerns, the company continued selling the products in the UK until 2022. Lawyers expect to file the claim this month at the high court in London.\n\nThe number of UK claimants has grown rapidly from 1,900 in November to 3,500, with most cases involving ovarian cancer, while others involve mesothelioma and peritoneal cancer. J&J has long faced similar lawsuits in the US, where it denies any link between talc and cancer. While the company has offered billions of dollars to settle nearly 60,000 US cases, it maintains that its products are safe. This lawsuit marks the first time the company will confront these allegations in a British court.\n\n\u201cAll our clients have suffered devastating consequences after using J&J\u2019s talcum powder products,\u201d said Tom Longstaff, a partner at KP Law. \u201cSome have tragically lost their lives, leaving families grieving their loss. They all deserve accountability and justice.\u201d He added, \u201cThere has already been substantial US litigation over the past several years, and we are now bringing the claim in the UK for the first time.\u201d\n\nWHO Labels Mineral Talc \u2018Probably Carcinogenic,\u2019 Whilst J&J Defends Product as Asbestos-Free and Cancer-Free\n\nKenvue, the J&J spin-off now handling talc-related claims outside the US and Canada, responded to the legal action by reaffirming its position. \u201cWe deeply sympathise with individuals affected by cancer and understand their search for answers,\u201d a company spokesperson said. \u201cHowever, rigorous scientific research consistently demonstrates that our talc-based powder does not cause cancer.\u201d\n\nThe company also accused lawyers of capitalising on fear. \u201cFor years, legal teams in the US have spread misinformation about talc, despite its long-standing safe use in food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other consumer goods. It is clear that similar tactics are now being employed in the UK to exploit vulnerable patients and their families.\u201d\n\nJ&J continues to stand behind the safety of its talc-based products. \u201cDecades of research by leading medical institutions in the UK and globally, using the most advanced testing methods, confirm that our product is asbestos-free and does not cause cancer,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nHowever, in July last year, the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that mineral talc is \u201cprobably carcinogenic for humans,\u201d shifting the focus of group action from asbestos contamination to the talc itself.\n\nTalc, widely used in cosmetics, often contains asbestos due to natural mineral formations. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies asbestos-contaminated talc as carcinogenic. J&J talc lawsuits allege the company\u2019s products caused mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, stomach cancer, and uterine cancer.\n\nJ&J has settled 95% of mesothelioma cases, with payouts ranging from $1 million to $1.4 million per claim. The company denies any health risks but discontinued its talc-based baby powder in 2023, switching to cornstarch alternatives.\n\nThe Scope of Talc-Related Lawsuits and Settlements\n\nMore than 62,000 talc lawsuits have been filed, with 99% involving ovarian cancer claims. In May 2024, J&J proposed a multibillion-dollar settlement and allowed victims three months to vote. Over 75% of claimants supported the offer, increasing the likelihood of court approval. However, government agencies remain concerned about potential financial losses from unpaid medical reimbursements.\n\nJ&J has set aside over $10 billion for talc-related payouts, including:\n\n$8 billion for ovarian cancer claims.\n\n$45 million for the family of a mesothelioma victim.\n\n$2.12 billion awarded to 22 women linking ovarian cancer to asbestos in J&J\u2019s talc products.\n\nJ&J has faced allegations of concealing asbestos risks for decades. Internal safety studies were reportedly halted, and the company continued selling talc-based products despite warnings.\n\nOctober 2019: The FDA detected asbestos in J&J\u2019s baby powder. The company disputed the findings but recalled thousands of bottles.\n\nFebruary 2021: J&J allocated $3.9 billion for talc lawsuit settlements.\n\nJuly 2021: A court ordered J&J to pay $2.12 billion to 22 women with ovarian cancer.\n\nOctober 2021: J&J attempted to push 38,000 lawsuits to bankruptcy court. An appeals court blocked the move.\n\nApril 2023: J&J proposed a $9 billion settlement, which the court rejected as too low.\n\nJune 2024: J&J was ordered to pay $260 million to an Oregon woman with mesothelioma. The verdict was later overturned.\n\nJuly 2024: The Supreme Court blocked J&J\u2019s second bankruptcy attempt.\n\nAugust 2024: J&J secured 75% plaintiff approval for their new bankruptcy plan.\n\nSeptember 2024: The company\u2019s subsidiary filed for bankruptcy a third time, increasing the talc settlement offer to $8 billion.\n\nU.S. Agencies Continue to Scrutinize J&J\u2019s Multi-Billion Dollar Talc Settlement and Texas Two-Step Strategy\n\nDespite widespread support for the settlement in the US, a court ruling in February will determine if J&J\u2019s plan can proceed, with several government agencies continuing to challenge J&J\u2019s talc bankruptcy plan in the country. J&J proposed $8 billion talc settlement faces opposition from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). These agencies argue that the settlement could prevent them from recovering costs related to talc-related healthcare expenses. The plan, part of J&J\u2019s third bankruptcy attempt, would compensate current and future ovarian cancer victims over 25 years. However, court approval is still pending.\n\nIf approved, claimants cannot opt out and pursue individual lawsuits. J&J\u2019s prior bankruptcy attempts were blocked, with judges ruling the company was not in financial distress. Critics argue the latest offer remains insufficient for affected victims. Meanwhile, J&J continues to defend its talc products, insisting they are safe.\n\nJ&J\u2019s legal maneuver, known as the Texas two-step, remains controversial. The company created a subsidiary, Red River Talc LLC, to absorb talc-related liabilities. This subsidiary then filed for bankruptcy, shielding J&J from direct lawsuits.\n\nCritics say this strategy allows J&J to evade accountability while limiting compensation. Many attorneys argue the $8 billion settlement does not adequately cover the damage caused. Additionally, federal agencies claim the move violates bankruptcy laws since J&J remains financially stable.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is certainly no stranger to the world of fashion and glamour.\n\nThe pharma giant hosted its ninth annual Blue Jacket Fashion Show in collaboration with designer Frederick Anderson in New York on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe show, founded by Anderson, brings together a collective of celebrities and media members to raise awareness about prostate cancer rates in men and encourage patients to get tested early.\n\nProstate cancer \u2014 which is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in men \u2014 has more than a 90% survival rate if caught early. Around 300,000 people are estimated to be diagnosed with the disease each year and more than 35,000 people will die from it.\n\nPlus, the disease disproportionately affects men of color. Black men are 70% more likely to contract the disease compared to their white counterparts and it\u2019s the leading form of cancer in Latino men.\n\nThe LGBTQIA+ community is also acutely impacted. While the rates amongst transgender men are lower than cisgendered men, they have almost double the mortality rate.\n\nIn light of these statistical trends, J&J is at the forefront of encouraging men to get screened early. Additionally, the drugmaker is developing therapies targeting the disease and investing in resources to support individuals with prostate cancer throughout their journey.\n\nHeld at Lavan Midtown, Tuesday night\u2019s gala featured an extensive roster of well-known figures, including Bill Nye the Science Guy, TV personality Don Lemon, actor Mario Cantone and New York City Councilmember Erik Bottcher, among others.\n\nCredit: Heerea Rikhraj.\n\nAll of them walked the sleek grey runway to cheers from the crowd while wearing outfits made by designers like Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger and Carlos Campos. Blue, the official color of prostate cancer awareness, was featured in various hues throughout the outfits.\n\nModel Alex Lunquvist donned a deep blue structured jacket with the words \u201cGet Tested\u201d on the back, amplifying the event\u2019s theme.\n\nThe show opened with remarks from Anderson and Biljana Naumovic, president of oncology, solid tumor at J&J.\n\nThe gala also featured remarks from Michael T. Pugh, the CEO and President of LISC, a non-profit organization aimed at building healthy and inclusive communities.\n\nThe organization partnered with the event and is providing screenings for men in vulnerable communities in New York, Atlanta, Detroit and Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cAs an African American man, it was so important to me to partner to shed light on this important topic,\u201d Pugh said.\n\nThe organizing team also partnered with Mount Sinai Hospital to provide screenings for men in Manhattan and Brooklyn. ZERO Prostate Cancer and Carver Federal Savings Bank were also sponsors of the event.\n\nOne of the more poignant runway walks was from Mark J., a prostate cancer advocate.\n\nMark, who danced down the runway in a plaid white structured blazer, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in his 50s. He received a full diagnosis and had to undergo both surgery and chemotherapy.\n\nPrior to the event, Mark described his patient journey as a \u201crollercoaster ride\u201d \u2014 though he has taken steps to take charge of his narrative.\n\nAfter being diagnosed, Mark launched a podcast series where he shares his experience living with the disease. He said he is aiming to raise awareness, encourage screenings and provide resources for those battling this disease.\n\n\u201cIf I can let people know about prostate cancer and get at least one other man to get himself checked, it is so important,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough September is designated as Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, Mark said that he hardly knew about its existence before being diagnosed. Going forward, he wants to change that for men.\n\nThis ambition was echoed by Naumovic, who wants men to be the center of the conversation around raising awareness of prostate cancer.\n\n\u201cThe crucial part of this issue is men talking about men\u2019s health,\u201d Naumovic said.\n\nShe noted that prostate cancer rates are expected to increase by \u201cmore than 100%\u201d over the next two decades, underscoring the importance of taking preemptive action against the disease.\n\nWhile J&J is developing drugs targeting the disease, she said the biggest problem is late detection of the disease \u2014 which adversely impacts patient outcomes.\n\nNaumovic suggested that \u201corganic, grassroots advocacy\u201d among patients is essential to amplifying conversations about the disease in vulnerable communities.\n\nShe said J&J\u2019s is investing in research centers across the country where men can participate in critical research for new therapies and get tested.\n\nIn addition to its drug discovery and R&D efforts, the pharma giant has championed initiatives like Libertas, one of the first degendered and transgender inclusive prostate cancer study protocols.\n\nThe company\u2019s Janssen division also launched Talk that Talk, a campaign focused on empowering Black men to have uncomfortable conversations about prostate cancer with their healthcare providers.\n\nNaumovic noted that in addition to these social awareness initiatives, the oncology team is working on medical advancements in the early prostate cancer space, including a therapy for a singular target in cells that is only found in prostate cancer.\n\n\u201cResults so far have been positive,\u201d Naumovic said, noting the team is headed to Phase 3 testing this year. \u201cWe want to make prostate cancer a thing of the past.\u201d",

            "content": "Lawyers representing 3,500 claimants are preparing to sue the pharmaceutical firm Johnson & Johnson (J&J) over alleged links between talcum powder and cancer, in what is expected to be one of the largest pharmaceutical product group actions in English and Welsh legal history.\n\nThey claim that thousands of women and some men contracted cancers after using J&J talcum powder products that had been contaminated with asbestos.\n\nThe specialist legal firm KP Law alleges that the US-based multinational knew as early as the 1970s that its talc products contained dangerous asbestos but failed to warn consumers and carried on selling the products in the UK until 2022.\n\nIt is making preparations to file papers this month at the high court in London.\n\nThe number of UK-based claimants has soared from 1,900 represented by the firm just last November. They include many cases of ovarian cancer and smaller numbers who have contracted mesothelioma and peritoneal cancer.\n\nJ&J has been the subject of long-running lawsuits in the US over similar allegations of cancer links to talc, which it disputes. The firm has proposed paying billions of dollars to settle almost 60,000 US claims, while continuing to deny that its products have caused cancer.\n\nThis will be the first time the company has faced a legal challenge on the issue in a British court.\n\nTom Longstaff, a partner at KP Law who is leading the UK case, said: \u201cAll the claimants who have sustained cancer after using J&J\u2019s talcum powder products have experienced a life-changing illness. In some cases they have died from their cancer, leaving their families devastated. All of these innocent individuals deserve justice.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Kenvue, formerly part of J&J which now has responsibility for talc-related claims outside the US and Canada, said: \u201cWe sympathise deeply with people who suffer from cancer and understand that they and their families want answers, but the robust science shows that use of our talc-based powder does not cause cancer.\n\n\u201cFor over a decade, lawyers in the United States have created unfounded confusion and unnecessary fear about talc, an ingredient that has been used safely in foods, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and consumer products for decades. It is clear that lawyers are now seeking to exploit cancer patients and their families in the United Kingdom by spreading this same fear.\n\n\u201cWe stand behind the safety of talc-based Johnson\u2019s baby powder. Decades of testing by medical experts at leading institutions in the UK and around the world using the most state-of-the-art testing protocols demonstrates that the product is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer.\u201d",

The lawsuits allege that prolonged use of talcum powder (or \u201ctalc\u201d), the active ingredient in products such as Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, can cause ovarian cancer in some women.\n\nThis page provides a J&J talc power litigation update and discusses what the settlement amounts in these ovarian cancer lawsuits will be for victims.\n\nBelow are the latest talc powder lawsuit news updates and information on how to bring a claim in 2024.\n\nHas the deadline passed for you to file a talcum powder lawsuit? Many who assume the statute of limitations has passed to sue Johnson & Johnson may be wrong. But as we write this in September 2024, this settlement is about to close out. We are still signing up new clients but this may not last much longer. Call us today at 800-553-8082 or get a free and quick case review online.\n\nLatest News on J&J Talc Powder Lawsuit Update 2025\n\nOur legal team is committed to keeping you informed about the ongoing developments in the Johnson & Johnson talc litigation, a case filled with enough high-stakes twists and turns that will make for a good movie one day. Here, we provide the latest updates, ensuring you stay up to date on this legal battle in which many of you have a real stake:\n\nMarch 5, 2025:\n\nThe Talcum powder MDL remained at a standstill in February, with no new cases added. The total number of pending cases in the MDL remains at 58,206.\n\nFebruary 19, 2025:\n\nThe moment is here. This week, a critical trial began in Texas to determine the fate of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s third talcum powder bankruptcy. The two-week proceeding, overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez, will feature up to 40 witnesses and focus on allegations that the Chapter 11 filing was made in bad faith and that voting irregularities influenced the approval of a $10 billion settlement plan. The crazy part is for all that effort, there is a good chance that Judge Lopez has long made up his mind. This is really a philosophical question: you are either for this nonsense or you are not.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are of two minds on this. Some oppose the bankruptcy, arguing that client votes were improperly switched after additional compensation was negotiated. Others, citing years of litigation without client payouts as a reason to move forward with a settlement. Our position? Both sides have points but the bankruptcy is utter nonsense.\n\nFebruary 4, 2025: MDL at Standstill\n\nThe talcum powder MDL has reached a standstill, with only one new case added in January, following just four new lawsuits in December. The total number of pending cases now stands at 58,206. The bankruptcy is putting a hold in things for now as we go into the big hearing in a two weeks.\n\nJanuary 28, 2025: Settlement Holdouts\n\nSome plaintiffs are pushing back against this settlement. They argue the $8 billion settlement plan unjustly denies victims their right to pursue claims in court and challenges the legitimacy of J&J\u2019s claim that the settlement is (arguably) supported by over 80% of claimants.\n\nUnder the plan, J&J\u2019s bankrupt subsidiary, Red River Talc, would establish a trust to compensate victims based on pre-set criteria, halting all related lawsuits. The holdouts, known as the Coalition of Counsel for Justice, criticize the proposal for lacking proof that funds are sufficient, not meeting bankruptcy standards for asbestos-related cases, and alleging flaws in the voting process. J&J contends that the settlement offers more compensation than trials could and accuses opponents of acting out of financial self-interest.\n\nWe will know more next month when all of this comes to a head.\n\nJanuary 24, 2025: Why Is J&J So Desperate to Do the Settlement Via Bankruptcy?\n\nWhy is Johnson & Johnson\u2019s so obsessed to resolve the talc litigation through bankruptcy court if they are just settling the cases anyway?\n\nThe answer is rooted in a desire for control and predictability. Bankruptcy allows J&J to cap its financial liability, halting the flood of lawsuits and ensuring all current and future claims are handled through a single, centralized process. This streamlined approach eliminates the unpredictability of jury trials and opt-outs, where verdicts have ranged from modest awards to staggering punitive damages. By establishing a trust with pre-defined criteria for payouts, J&J creates uniformity in compensation while avoiding the risk of runaway verdicts that could escalate costs or set damaging legal precedents.\n\nJanuary 7, 2025: Strange Defense Verdict in Pittsburgh\n\nA talc trial in Pittsburgh concluded with a defense verdict for Johnson & Johnson but left a striking message from the jury that cannot be ignored. While the jury determined that the company\u2019s talc products did not cause the plaintiff\u2019s mesothelioma, it simultaneously awarded $22 million in punitive damages. What was the jury trying to do? Who knows? But this contradiction seemingly underscores a clear sentiment from the jury: they believed Johnson & Johnson\u2019s actions warranted punishment, regardless of the ultimate causation finding. The jury found Johnson & Johnson negligent and agreed that the company misrepresented the safety of its talc products. Although they did not link these actions to the plaintiff\u2019s illness, the decision to award punitive damages speaks volumes about the jury\u2019s perception of the company\u2019s conduct. Despite instructions not to consider punitive damages without causation, the jury\u2019s actions suggest a strong desire to hold Johnson & Johnson accountable.\n\nJanuary 3, 2025: MDL Case Count Update\n\nJust four new talc powder lawsuits were filed in the MDL last month. There are now 58,205 total pending cases.\n\nDecember 29, 2024: Where We Are Going into 2025?\n\nThe next big thing in this litigation will be the bankrupcty hearing on February 18th. This hearing will determine whether the company\u2019s proposed $10 billion bankruptcy plan can move forward and whether its Chapter 11 case will survive dismissal. For tens of thousands of cancer victims, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\n\nAt the center of the trial is J&J\u2019s controversial use of the Texas two-step bankruptcy strategy. We all know this maneuver is designed to shield the company from full accountability while limiting victims\u2019 recoveries. Some plaintiffs are fine with this. They want their money sooner rather than later. But other plaintiffs claim the plan unfairly prioritizes corporate interests over justice for those harmed by asbestos-contaminated talc products.\n\nAdding to the complexity, the trial comes on the heels of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Purdue Pharma\u2019s bankruptcy, which struck down similar third-party liability protections. This decision casts doubt on the legality of J&J\u2019s plan, particularly as allegations of voting irregularities persist. Any ruling is likely to face appeals, potentially all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nFor plaintiffs, this trial could mark a step toward justice\u2014or yet another delay in their long fight.\n\nDecember 5, 2024: Taking Down the Texas Two-Step\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren has reintroduced the Nondebtor Release Prohibition Act of 2024 to combat controversial bankruptcy strategies that allow wealthy individuals and corporations to sidestep liability. The legislation seeks to end nonconsensual litigation shields for nonbankrupt entities and codify the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling in Harrington v. Purdue Pharma, which rejected liability releases for the Sackler family in Purdue\u2019s bankruptcy. Warren also targets the \u201cTexas Two-Step\u201d maneuver, a tactic used by companies like Johnson & Johnson to isolate liabilities in a subsidiary and place it into bankruptcy, shielding the parent company from lawsuits. The bill\u2019s provisions aim to close loopholes that have allowed corporations to misuse the bankruptcy system to avoid accountability for widespread harm, such as public health crises and mass tort claims.\n\nThis legislation, while previously seen as a partisan effort by progressive Democrats, is increasingly attracting bipartisan interest. The Harrington v. Purdue Pharma decision and public outrage over corporate misuse of bankruptcy have galvanized lawmakers across party lines. Notably, a bipartisan group introduced the Ending Corporate Bankruptcy Abuse Act earlier this year to address similar issues. Republicans traditionally aligned with pro-business interests may now find common ground with Democrats on this issue, provided they can resist lobbying pressure from powerful corporate interests. As both parties face growing voter discontent over corporate accountability, this could become a rare opportunity for bipartisan reform. The Nondebtor Release Prohibition Act of 2024\u2014which could also fairly be called the Stop Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Nonsense Act\u2014would have a significant impact on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talc bankruptcy strategy, particularly its use of the Texas Two-Step maneuver. By invalidating bankruptcy filings from companies that engaged in divisional mergers to isolate liabilities within the past ten years, the bill would directly challenge J&J\u2019s effort to separate its talc liabilities into a subsidiary and shield the parent company from lawsuits. Additionally, the legislation\u2019s restriction on nonconsensual litigation shields and its requirement for explicit creditor consent would further weaken J&J\u2019s ability to impose settlements on plaintiffs without their agreement. If this law had been in place, J&J\u2019s controversial bankruptcy strategy would have never gotten off the ground.\n\nDecember 3, 2024: Wait Until March\n\nThe bankruptcy judge has ruled that baby powder lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson will remain on hold until mid-March. The pause allows J&J to pursue its bankruptcy strategy aimed at permanently resolving tens of thousands of injury claims.\n\nDuring a hearing yesterday, the judge declined to either broaden the litigation freeze to include other entities allegedly involved or lift the block to allow some cases to proceed. J&J is proposing to pay over $8 billion to settle the claims through a corporate entity it created to absorb the lawsuits and file for bankruptcy. A trial is scheduled for late January to determine whether Judge Lopez will approve J&J\u2019s bankruptcy plan. Th\n\nDecember 2, 2024: Slow Growth in MDL\n\nThe talcum powder MDL added only three new lawsuits in November, marking its slowest month in over a year. The total number of pending cases now stands at 58,201. Lawyers are focused more on settlement of existing claims at this point although our firm is still taking new cases.\n\nNovember 14, 2024: DOJ Pushback\n\nThe Department of Justice, through its bankruptcy monitor, the U.S. Trustee, is objecting to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s choice of Jones Day as counsel for its subsidiary, Red River Talc LLC, in its bankruptcy case. The U.S. Trustee objected, citing a conflict of interest, as Jones Day previously devised the \u201cTexas Two-Step\u201d tactic allowing companies to create a subsidiary burdened with liabilities to file for bankruptcy, shielding parent assets from mass tort claims. It will be interesting to see if a Trump administration will provide similar oversight, given the potential shift in regulatory focus that might deprioritize aggressive intervention in corporate restructuring cases like this one.\n\nOctober 29, 2024: January Hearing on Bankruptcy\n\nIn January 2025, a federal judge in Houston will decide whether to approve J&J\u2019s plan, which aims to resolve these claims efficiently after prior failed bankruptcy attempts in New Jersey. Most plaintiffs are really frustrated at how long this is taking.\n\nOctober 15, 2024: Connecticut Meso Verdict\n\nJohnson & Johnson, along with several subsidiaries, was recently ordered to pay $15 million in damages in a mesothelioma lawsuit involving a real estate developer in Connecticut. The lawsuit held the company accountable for the plaintiff\u2019s asbestos exposure, which led to the mesothelioma diagnosis.\n\nOctober 12, 2024: Connecticut Mesothelioma Trial\n\nThe jury will deliberate in a Connecticut mesothelioma trial involving a Massachusetts real estate developer diagnosed with mesothelioma. His lawyers requested $30 million in damages from Johnson & Johnson; J&J suggested $4 million.\n\nJ&J\u2019s defense denied liability, suggesting that his illness resulted from a genetic mutation rather than asbestos exposure. But J&J\u2019s attorneys argued that if they were found responsible, the number should be more like $4 million. Let me tell you, a defense lawyer that offers a verdict amount in closing statements is a defense lawyer that does not expect to win.\n\nOctober 9, 2024: J&J Bankruptcy to Stay in\n\nA federal judge somehow in Texas somehow ruled that Johnson & Johnson (J&J) did not improperly manipulate bankruptcy laws by filing its insolvency case in Texas instead of its home state, New Jersey. This decision allows J&J to continue its efforts to settle thousands of lawsuits alleging its baby powder caused cancer. J&J has created a new separate bankruptcy subsidiary, Red River Talc, to take on the liability from these lawsuits and then filed for bankruptcy. It is the same old thing, the third time around.\n\nThe ruling is a significant victory for J&J. It wants to get this $8 billion or so settlement done that is said to be supported by around 83% of plaintiffs. This is a win for you if you, too, if you are a victim and just ready to get this over with.\n\nSeptember 30, 2024: U.S. Trustee Accuses J&J Of \u201cForum Shopping\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Trustee is a government official who oversees bankruptcy cases to ensure they are conducted fairly and according to the law, acting as a watchdog against misuse of the bankruptcy system. The Trustee gets involved in any bankruptcy to ensure that the bankruptcy process is fair and transparent. They act as a watchdog to make sure that companies are not using bankruptcy just to escape legal liabilities or unfairly disadvantage creditors.\n\nThe U.S. Trustee for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s third talc bankruptcy has put their thumbs on the scale of the bankruptcy debate. In a motion to transfer the case from the Southern District of Texas to New Jersey, the attorney for the U.S. Trustee accuses J&J of \u201cforum shopping,\u201d or choosing a favorable court, by filing the third bankruptcy in Texas through its subsidiary Red River Talc LLC. The Trustee argues that Red River is essentially the same company as the previous LTL Management, with the same liabilities and assets, and claims that J&J is trying to avoid the unfavorable rulings it received in New Jersey. The U.S. Trustee believes that the case should return to New Jersey to maintain the integrity of the bankruptcy system.\n\nSeptember 25, 2024: Texas Bankruptcy Judge Temporarily Halts Some Lawsuits Against J&J\n\nA Texas bankruptcy judge has temporarily halted some talc lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson to address jurisdictional questions in the Chapter 11 case of its spinoff, Red River Talc LLC.\n\nRed River was created to handle these claims, offering a $9 billion settlement plan to victims. The big issue is whether J&J will be allowed to do this in Texas.\n\nSeptember 23, 2024: J&J Announced Pre-Packaged Plan For $8 Billion Settlement Fund\n\nThis time, as a part of a \u201csort of\u201d agreed upon settlement plant, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talc unit, Red River Talc LLC, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This is the third time J&J has tried the bankruptcy route to resolve its talc-related liability claims.\n\nThe company announced a pre-packaged plan supposedly supported by 83% of current talc injury plaintiffs, proposing an $8 billion settlement fund to cover both current and future ovarian cancer claims. This plan would resolve 99.75% of existing claims, with remaining mesothelioma lawsuits being addressed separately.\n\nSeptember 20, 2024: Vacuum Of Information Surrounding Details Of Settlement Payouts\n\nThe last settlement rumors were $9.1 billion. Now, J&J is leaking the number $8.2 to the media.\n\nPlaintiffs also need more information on how the payouts will work. There is just a vacuum of information on the details.\n\nThis litigation has been a circus on every level.\n\nSeptember 16, 2024: Oregon State Judge Overturns $260 Million Verdict Against J&J\n\nA state judge in Oregon has overturned a $260 million jury verdict against Johnson & Johnson (J&J) in a case involving a woman who claimed she developed mesothelioma, a cancer linked to asbestos exposure, from using the company\u2019s talc powder. The judge granted J&J\u2019s request for a new trial, with a written explanation of the ruling to come. J&J argued that legal errors led to the original verdict, while the plaintiff\u2019s legal team plans to appeal the decision.\n\nSeptember 12, 2024: New Talcum Powder Mesothelioma Trial Underway In Connecticut\n\nA new talc meso trial has begun in Connecticut. A 64-year-old plaintiff diagnosed with mesothelioma sued J&J claiming the disease was caused by his lifetime use of J&J\u2019s talcum powder products. The plaintiff says he used J&J baby powder during childhood to treat rashes and later as an athlete in college.\n\nSeptember 9, 2024: Total Settlement To Reach Over $9 Billion\n\nJ&J reportedly plans to pay an additional $1.1 billion to complete this deal. This would bring the total settlement to over $9 billion\u2026paid out over 25 years.\n\nAugust 22, 2024: J&J Requests Judge Dismiss Proposed Class Action Aimed At Providing Medical Monitoring For Users Of Talc-Based Products\n\nJohnson & Johnson has requested that a federal judge dismiss a proposed national class action aimed at providing medical monitoring for users of its talc-based products.\n\nThe medical monitoring compensation refers to the financial compensation sought to cover the cost of ongoing surveillance and health assessments for individuals who have been exposed to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talc products but may not yet have been diagnosed with a related illness. This type of damage claim is premised on the need for periodic medical evaluations to detect early signs of diseases, such as ovarian or gynecological cancers.\n\nI have mixed feelings about these lawsuits. The actual compensation for individual plaintiffs is small and it takes the focus off victims who have suffered real injury from this product.\n\nAugust 16, 2024: South Carolina Jury Awards $63 Million To Terminal Lung Cancer Patient\n\nIt is hard to imagine the thinking that lets these mesothelioma lawsuits go to trial. Why J&J does not make sure it settles them all is beyond me.\n\nIn another case in point, a South Carolina jury awarded over $63 million to Michael Perry, a cancer patient who developed terminal lung cancer, specifically mesothelioma, from inhaling asbestos in J&J\u2019s talc-based baby powder. The verdict found both Johnson & Johnson and American International Industries (AII) negligent, attributing their products as the proximate cause of Perry\u2019s condition.\n\nWhile J&J was cleared of fraudulent misrepresentation, AII was found culpable. The jury determined their actions as \u201cwillful, wanton, or reckless,\u201d awarding Perry economic and other damages exceeding $23 million, and his spouse, Lonnie Long, received over $9.6 million for loss of consortium. Additionally, punitive damages amounted to $30 million against J&J and $760,000 against AII, totaling $63.4 million owed to Perry and Long.\n\nAugust 12, 2024: Early Rumors Suggest More Than 75% Of Claimants Voted In Favor Of Settlement Plan\n\nAt the end of July, the talc claimants voted to approve the latest settlement plan. Although the official results of that vote have not yet been released, the early rumors are that more than the required 75% of claimants voted in favor of the plan.\n\nJuly 26, 2024: 3rd Circuit Upholds Dismissal Order Stating J&J Subsidiary Bankruptcy Was Not Made In Good Faith\n\nThe talc powder bankruptcy is as foolish as I have been telling you, the 3rd Circuit said yesterday. It upheld the dismissal order stating that LTL Management, a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary set up to take all of the talc liability, was not financially distressed, and thus, its bankruptcy filing was not made in good faith.\n\nThe court found that the potential for future insolvency does not justify a Chapter 11 filing.\n\nJ&J wants to appeal to the Supreme Court. Give me a break already.\n\nJuly 25, 2024: Voting On Proposed Settlement Plan Ends Tomorrow Afternoon\n\nClaimants must vote to accept or reject the settlement plan by 4:00 p.m. (Central Time) tomorrow. Information on voting is provided in a solicitation package sent to claimants or their attorneys.\n\nThe plan commits J&J and its make-believe companies to pay ovarian cancer claimants a present value of approximately $6.475 billion over 25 years, creating a multi-billion-dollar trust to compensate current and future talc claims related to ovarian cancer.\n\nBecause this whole thing is so convoluted if accepted by at least 75% of voters, the plan will lead to a bankruptcy filing under the case name \u201cIn re: Red River Talc LLC\u201d in bankruptcy court. A hearing would be scheduled to confirm the plan, with further notifications issued if the court sets an objection deadline.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the vote plays out. My assumption is that many plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers changed gears over time and that more will recommend their clients take the settlement. But it remains to be seen.\n\nJuly 9, 2024: New Study From WHO Finds Exposure To J&J Talcum Power Increases Risk Of Cancer\n\nThe house of cards J&J has built to argue its talc powder did not cause cancer is collapsing. Exposure to talc in Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder is likely to increase the risk of cancer, particularly ovarian cancer, according to a recent assessment by the World Health Organization.\n\nThis litigation started with people dismissing the connection between talc and baby powder as the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers\u2019 manufactured tale. It will end with it being a pretty much-accepted fact.\n\nJuly 3, 2024: Claimants To Vote On Proposed $6.5 Billion Settlement To Resolve Talcum Power Lawsuits\n\nA big decision is coming up on settlement in these lawsuits. J&J proposed a $6.5 billion settlement to resolve baby powder ovarian cancer lawsuits, contingent on a supermajority agreement (75%) from claimants at the end of this month. This is a big deal.\n\nMedia coverage has been more focused on J&J\u2019s legal dispute with a firm involved in long-standing talcum powder mass tort litigation. J&J wants to disqualify the firm from the litigation, alleging many ethical violations they seem to be bringing out of pure spite, just like the failed lawsuit it brought against a plaintiff\u2019s expert we discussed yesterday.\n\nWe are getting closer to the end. The focus should turn to what really matters: getting these women compensated for the harm done to them.\n\nJuly 2, 2024: J&J\u2019s Lawsuit Against Expert Witness Fails\n\nJ&J\u2019s plan to gain an advantage in the talc litigation by filing frivolous lawsuits against the plaintiffs\u2019 experts failed as expected yesterday. It lost its case against a prominent doctor, Jacqueline Moline, whom it accused of not disclosing alternative asbestos exposure evidence and making false statements regarding J&J\u2019s baby powder.\n\nThis doomed-to-fail-but-sure-to-harass lawsuit centered around a 2019 article by Moline stating that 33 plaintiffs who used J&J talc products and developed mesothelioma had no other potential exposures to asbestos.\n\nThe New Jersey federal court judge ruled that Moline\u2019s statements are protected by the First Amendment.\n\nJune 30, 2024: Court Expected To Allow J&J To Settle In Bankruptcy\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s love affair with bankruptcy court continues, and it looks like the court will allow J&J to settle these claims in bankruptcy if the deal works out.\n\nOn Friday, the MDL judge denied the claimants\u2019 motion \u2013 should say for some claimants, not others \u2013 for a temporary restraining order, stating that they failed to demonstrate actual harm that would justify an injunction.\n\nThe judge dismissed the argument that the settlement proposal would improperly limit the funds available to claimants, finding the claimants\u2019 concerns about future harm speculative and insufficient for a preliminary injunction. He noted that the alleged harm depended on future events that might never happen.\n\nSo the stage is set for the settlement vote at the end of the month.\n\nJune 26, 2024: Expected Results Of Proposed Settlement Package\n\nI\u2019ve been going back and forth on my predictions on whether this talc powder settlement goes through. I\u2019m certainly leaning towards thinking the settlement will be completed from talking to people over the last few weeks. It is by no means a done deal, however. There are still pockets of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers who are dead set against it and will have their clients vote that way next month.\n\nJune 13, 2024: Plaintiff\u2019s Lawyers Split On Stance Towards J&J\u2019s Settlement Offer\n\nWhere are we on the talc powder settlement? Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are split on whether to recommend J&J\u2019s settlement offer to their clients. In terms of which way the wind is blowing today, it is toward settlement.\n\nJune 10, 2024: J&J Reaches $700 Million Settlement With 43 States And DC\n\nJ&J reached a $700 million settlement with 43 states and the District of Columbia over the marketing of its talcum powder and agreed to stop marketing and manufacturing baby powder with talc. J&J is clearly looking to put talc powder-related litigation in its rearview mirror.\n\nJune 7, 2024: New Talcum Power Cancer Trail Underway In Texas\n\nA new talcum powder cancer trial against J&J got underway this week in Dallas, Texas. Opening statements were presented on Wednesday, and the trial is expected to take two to three weeks to complete. This is the first talc trial we have seen in a while, and it is the first in Texas. [Update: this case settled.]\n\nJune 4, 2024: Oregon Jury Orders $260 Million Verdict\n\nJohnson & Johnson keeps letting asbestos lawsuit go to trial. It never works. The latest message to them was sent by an Oregon jury that ordered the company to pay $260 million to a woman who attributed her cancer to the lifelong use of the company\u2019s baby powder. The jury found J&J liable for Kyung Lee\u2019s mesothelioma and awarded her $200 million in compensatory damages along with $60 million in punitive damages. Lee, diagnosed with cancer last year at age 48, argued that the talc-based baby powder contained asbestos.\n\nMay 21, 2024: New Journal Of Clinical Oncology Research Favors Talcum Powder Plaintiffs\n\nNew research published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology supports over 50,000 lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson, claiming that its talc-based baby powder causes ovarian cancer. The study, conducted by researchers from the National Institutes of Health, found a significant association between genital application of talc powder and ovarian cancer, especially with frequent or long-term use.\n\nThese findings are a death knell to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s defense that its talc products are safe and asbestos-free. It also has the potential to stop this talc powder settlement going through.\n\nMay 1, 2024: J&J Agrees To $6.5 Billion Global Settlement Through Subsidiary\u2019s Bankruptcy\n\nThis morning, it was announced that J&J (through its talcum spinoff subsidiary) has agreed to a $6.5 billion global settlement deal to resolve the majority of the talcum powder ovarian cancer claims.\n\nAs part of the deal, the talcum plaintiffs will allow J&J\u2019s subsidiary to file a third bankruptcy proceeding. The prior two bankruptcies faced strong opposition by the talc plaintiffs and were eventually dismissed. This settlement deal only covers the talcum powder claims involving ovarian cancer. J&J has already settled 95% of the talcum powder claims involving mesothelioma. Will the plaintiffs approve the deal? The vote is on July 26, 2024.\n\nApril 30, 2024: Plaintiffs\u2019 Attorneys Contest MDL Judge\u2019s Mandate For Full Refilling Of Daubert Motions\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 attorneys representing clients in the talc powder litigation are contesting the MDL judge\u2019s mandate for a full refiling of Daubert motions. They argue that this requirement, issued without an accompanying detailed opinion or legal rationale, is unwarranted and lacks support from legal precedent.\n\nThe lawyers assert that the justifications provided for this directive\u2014recent amendments to Federal Rule of Evidence 702, emergent scientific insights, and the language used in a previous Daubert opinion by Chief Judge Wolfson\u2014do not sufficiently substantiate the need for such a comprehensive procedural measure, especially since it was not solicited by any involved party nor was it subject to prior discussion. They correctly contend that changes to Rule 702 are unlikely to affect the ruling in this case. These prior decisions have stood unchallenged upon appeal, thereby affirming their appropriateness, and diminishing the justification for a total refiling.\n\nWhat is the point of all this? Would this new judge really flip Judge Woflson\u2019s ruling even though it would likely get overturned by the appeals court? I think putting some fear in plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers \u2013 oh, no, would he really do this? \u2013 might be an intentional strategy to pressure plaintiffs into settling.\n\nApril 22, 2024: J&J Ordered To Pay $45 Million To Family Of Illinois Woman Who Died From Mesothelioma\n\nJohnson & Johnson and its spinoff Kenvue Inc. were ordered to pay $45 million to the family of Theresa Garcia, an Illinois woman who died in 2020 from mesothelioma, a cancer linked to asbestos exposure. Jurors in Chicago found Kenvue 70% responsible for Garcia\u2019s death, attributing the remaining 30% to J&J. The family alleged the companies knew their talcum-based baby powder was contaminated with asbestos. This case marks one of the first significant verdicts against J&J and its affiliates since a judge dismissed a bankruptcy filing by a J&J unit last year, intended to settle ongoing talc cases.\n\nThis is a great win and takes some of the pain out of the verdict in Florida last week.\n\nApril 18, 2024: Florida Jury Rules J&J Was Not Responsible For Ovarian Cancer Of Sarasota County Woman\n\nTough loss today. A Florida state court jury ruled that Johnson & Johnson\u2019s baby powder talc product was not responsible for the ovarian cancer that led to the death of a Sarasota County woman. Her family\u2019s lawsuit claimed that she used the powder daily from 1965 until her cancer diagnosis in 2016.\n\nApril 2, 2024: New Talcum Powder Lawsuit Underway In Florida\n\nIn Sarasota, Florida, a new talc powder lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson is underway. This is a wrongful death claim brought by the widower of a woman who used J&J\u2019s baby powder for decades and later died from ovarian cancer.\n\nThis is the second post-bankruptcy ovarian cancer trial. The first case, as we detail in updates below, starting with the February 14th update, was declared due to a deadlocked Miami jury over the causal link between J&J\u2019s baby powder and the death of an anesthesiologist.\n\nMarch 27, 2024: MDL Judge Orders Complete Resubmission Of Daubert Motions\n\nMDL Judge Michael A. Shipp has determined that updates to Federal Rule of Evidence 702, new scientific developments, and the considerations highlighted in Chief Judge Wolfson\u2019s prior Daubert Opinion justify a complete re-submission of Daubert motions. As a result, parties are directed to file their Daubert motions by July 23, 2024, with any counterarguments to be submitted by August 22, 2024. The court will not, for reasons unclear, allow any reply submissions.\n\nIf Judge Shipp were to reverse the previous order from 2020 or Daubert, the chances of prevailing on appeal would be very high. But that would drag this litigation on even further.\n\nIt is hard to make sense of this ruling. This is hardly a case where the slight Rule 702 changes should change things one iota. Is this to pressure plaintiffs into a settlement? That is the only reason that comes to mind.\n\nMarch 19, 2024: Plaintiff\u2019s Lawyers Fight J&J\u2019s Efforts To Quash Subpoena Served On PwC\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are fighting J&J\u2019s efforts to quash a subpoena served on PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC). The subpoena seeks all communications related to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s contingent liability for its talcum powder products, specifically concerning the process of removing said liability from its balance sheets. J&J challenged the subpoena\u2019s relevance and argued that the requested communications are protected under the attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine.\n\nBut plaintiffs argue these objections by asserting the relevance of the requested information, particularly in light of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s public threats to file a third bankruptcy case to resolve its talcum powder lawsuits, which could bring ongoing litigation to a standstill. Victim\u2019s talc attorneys argue that the information sought is crucial to understanding the defendants\u2019 ability to resolve talc liabilities. It is similar to information previously sought by the defendants in related subpoenas.\n\nMarch 6, 2024: Florida State Judge Declares Mistrial After Jurors\u2019 Deadlock\n\nA Florida state judge declared a mistrial after jurors couldn\u2019t reach a verdict on whether Johnson & Johnson\u2019s baby powder caused the cancer that killed a Miami anesthesiologist. The jury twice told the court they were deadlocked \u2013 \u201chopelessly deadlocked\u201d after a day and a half of deliberations.\n\nThe deceased\u2019s widower \u2013 a well-known Miami lawyer \u2013 argued that the baby powder caused his wife\u2019s cancer. The plaintiff used the powder for decades before being diagnosed with cancer in 2016 and died in 2019. He asked for $14 million in damages.\n\nMarch 1, 2024: Chief Medical Officer Of J&J Claims No Evidence Linking Talcum Powder To Ovarian Cancer\n\nThe Miami ovarian cancer talc powder trial is now in the defense case. (See the February 14 update below.) Dr. Edwin Kuffner, the Chief Medical Officer of Johnson & Johnson, told the jury that an extensive examination of scientific studies by his department revealed no evidence linking the use of baby powder to ovarian cancer.\n\nHe said J&J would not have issued a warning but would have immediately removed it from the market if any evidence of such a link had been discovered. Of course, J&J did pull talc powder off the market in 2020 for a \u201cbusiness reason.\u201d The business reason was that many people disagreed with Dr. Kuffner.\n\nFebruary 14, 2024: New Talcum Powder Trial Unfolds In Miami\n\nJ&J surprised me by letting another case go to trial: In a new trial unfolding in Miami, a jury heard allegations that J&J has been aware for decades that its baby powder could potentially cause cancer. The lawsuit \u2013 filed by the surviving spouse, a Miami lawyer \u2013 aims to hold the company responsible for the 2019 death of an anesthesiologist who used talcum powder daily over 50 years.\n\nFebruary 10, 2024: New MDL Deadlines\n\nNew deadlines in the MDL:\n\nAction Deadline Completion of Plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness depositions April 9, 2024 Defendants\u2019 designation and report service of all experts May 21, 2024 Completion of Defendants\u2019 expert witness depositions July 2, 2024 Filing of Dispositive motions, including Daubert motions July 23, 2024 Filing of Oppositions to Dispositive/Daubert motions August 22, 2024 Filing of Replies in support of Dispositive/Daubert motions September 12, 2024\n\nSo we are looking at the end of the year at best for the subsequent talc powder trial in the MDL.\n\nFebruary 5, 2024: J&J Continues To Go After Experts And Lawyers\n\nJ&J continues to try to attack plaintiffs\u2019 experts and lawyers. It will stop at nothing, and it will still fail.\n\nThe company is issuing new subpoenas to challenge the plaintiffs\u2019 preparations. One subpoena targets Northwell Health Inc., seeking research participant names from Dr. Jacqueline Moline\u2019s studies that link cosmetic talcum powder use to mesothelioma, despite her research focusing on a different type of cancer than the ovarian cancer claims in the litigation.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has also subpoenaed KCIC, a products liability consultant, in a goofy effort to disqualify a plaintiffs\u2019 attorney and his firm from leading the litigation.\n\nJanuary 23, 2024: J&J Offers $6.9 Billion Settlement\n\nJ&J has offered $6.9 billion to settle more than 50,000 ovarian cancer claims. So the average talc settlement under this proposal would be around $130,000.\n\nWait, wasn\u2019t the offer just $8.9 billion? It was. But J&J is handling the mesothelioma cancer claims separately now.\n\nEveryone knows J&J needs to pay more. The question is how much more they will pay and how long it will take for the talc powder lawsuits to settle.\n\nJanuary 11, 2024: J&J Agrees To $700 Million Settlement In Lawsuits Regarding Deceptive Marketing Tactics\n\nJohnson & Johnson has agreed to a $700 million settlement in talc powder lawsuits from numerous U.S. states regarding the company\u2019s deceptive marketing tactics.\n\nThe gist of the lawsuit was that Johnson & Johnson failed to reveal asbestos contamination in its talcum powder products \u2013 a factor increasing the risk of ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. This agreement, involving over 40 states, will settle all existing and potential state-level lawsuits accusing the company of hiding or not disclosing the cancer risks associated with its talcum powder products.\n\nWhat does this news mean to you if you are one of the 50,000 talc powder victims who have filed a lawsuit? That\u2019s a good question. Our lawyers think this is good news for you because it clears out distractions. We need everyone\u2019s attention focused on reaching a global talc powder settlement in 2024. This helps.\n\nJanuary 3, 2024: J&J Investors File Class Action Against The Company\n\nJ&J investors have filed a class action lawsuit that echoes the personal injury and wrongful death plaintiffs in the talc baby powder class action lawsuit. A federal court judge in New Jersey has certified the class action.\n\nWhat is the gist of this new class action? The lawsuit also contends that Johnson & Johnson made misleading statements regarding its product safety and research commitments. Specifically, the investors claim that while the company publicly touted the safety of its talc products, it was internally aware of concerns raised by an external laboratory about the inadequacy of testing methods for detecting asbestos in its products.\n\nLatest News on J&J Talcum Powder Lawsuit in 2023\n\nDecember 23, 2023: Update On J&J\u2019s Allegations Of Lawyer\u2019s Unethical Conduct\n\nAs we told you on Tuesday, J&J filed a motion that alleged that a plaintiffs\u2019 talc powder law firm formed an inappropriate relationship with a former attorney who had worked with J&J, accusing them of using confidential information for their advantage. This former attorney, after leaving his previous firm, was alleged to have collaborated with the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney in the talc litigation, which would be unethical.\n\nThe law firm responded yesterday, refuting claims of acquiring privileged information. They argued that J&J\u2019s motion was an attempt to deflect from its own failures in addressing talc injury claims. Well, we all know there is ample evidence of this.\n\nIs any of this important to you? Not really. We are just keeping you on a minor issue during a quiet time in the talc litigation after a number of settlements and the holidays on deck. Hopefully, as we head in 2024, our updates will be more about the path to a global talc powder settlement that finally compensates all victims.\n\nDecember 19, 2023: J&J Seeks To Disqualify Plaintiff Attorney And Law Firm From Talcum Powder MDL\n\nJohnson & Johnson (J&J) seeks to disqualify a plaintiffs\u2019 attorney and their law firm from the talcum powder multidistrict litigation. J&J cites concerns over the attorney\u2019s recent partnership with a former lawyer who previously worked on the opposite side of the talcum powder litigation. Together, they are involved in negotiating a $19 billion settlement for ovarian cancer cases related to J&J\u2019s talcum powder products. J&J argues that this partnership poses a conflict of interest and potential exposure to confidential information. This dispute revolves around the resolution of numerous talcum powder cases.\n\nDecember 8, 2023: Interesting Bloomberg Article Surrounding Attorney Who Proposed $19 Billion Settlement\n\nBloomberg has an interesting article about an attorney who has proposed a $19 billion settlement for all present and future talc powder lawsuits.\n\nThe lawyer\u2019s plan is for his company would buy J&J units to deal with the talc cases and figure out how to divide up the settlement proceeds. The lawyer used to defend baby powder lawsuits for J&J, who is renouncing the plan. The conflicts of interest, the idea of a company getting paid to take on the sole responsibility for settlement\u2026 the whole thing is convoluted.\n\nStill, the article is interesting for two reasons. First, $19 billion is a concrete number that would seemingly lead to a talc powder lawsuit settlement average of $200,000. You always pay attention when you see numbers and can roughly equate them to average settlement payouts.\n\nThe suggestion that a settlement that covers future payments is interesting. That is the problem for J&J, right? These claims will continue to go on even if there is a global settlement of the 50,000 claims against it. Estimating the number of future claims and their potential costs would be extremely difficult and potentially wildly unfair to future plaintiffs.\n\nThe question most victims have now is how long it will take for the talc powder lawsuit to settle. The real truth is that if plaintiffs want to hold out for $19 billion \u2013 and it is not an unreasonable position \u2013 it will take a lot more time, and it is unlikely that a deal will get done in 2024. The more likely scenario is a settlement in 2024 that is between $8.9 billion and $19 billion\n\nDecember 5, 2023: J&J Seeks To Settle Lawsuits Regarding Asbestos Related Cancer\n\nJohnson & Johnson is actively seeking to settle a number of lawsuits claiming that its talc-based Baby Powder is linked to cancer caused by asbestos. This move is intended to circumvent upcoming jury trials in 2024. These are tough cases of J&J, and the company now finally seems to accept that it needs to pay a lot of money to resolve these asbestos lawsuits.\n\nThis effort is aimed at avoiding jury trials scheduled for next year. There are a lot of trials scheduled. Of course, J&J is looking down the barrel of more than just asbestos claims. The company faces over 50,000 talc powder lawsuits, almost all alleging their ovarian cancer was caused by the use of baby powder. J&J still dreams of a third bankruptcy filing to comprehensively resolve the talc litigation. It will not work.\n\nNovember 17, 2023: J&J Settles Two Talcum Powder Trials For Confidential Amounts\n\nJ&J has wisely decided to catch its breath and settle two talc trials heading for trial. The first case was settled in the middle of trial on Wednesday. A second case settled after a jury was picked. A third lawsuit scheduled in Seattle has been postponed to February 2024.\n\nHow much were these talc powder settlements? As you probably guessed, the settlement amounts are confidential.\n\nNovember 7, 2023: J&J Seeks Third Attempt At Filing Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\n\nJ&J is making rumblings about a third attempt at filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for its LTL unit as a strategy to resolve lawsuits claiming its talc products cause cancer. Having failed twice in New Jersey courts due to the Third Circuit\u2019s ruling that the LTL unit lacked immediate financial distress and could not file in good faith, J&J is contemplating filing in the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Southern District of Texas because they think this forum might be more favorable.\n\nSneak preview of the outcome: it does not work, and J&J wastes even more money.\n\nNovember 1, 2023: MDL Judge Seeks To Get Litigation Back On Track With New Scheduling Order\n\nForward progress in the talcum powder class action MDL has been stalled for nearly two years due to J&J\u2019s two failed efforts to pull the litigation into bankruptcy. Now that this delay is finally over (for now at least), the MDL judge recently sought to get things back on track by issuing a new scheduling order for six cases previously selected for bellwether trials. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that they developed cancer from asbestos in the J&J talc product Shower-to-Shower.\n\nOctober 3, 2023: Appeals Court Nullifies $233 Million Jury Award\n\nJ&J got a win yesterday when an appeals court nullified a $223 million jury award to baby powder users who attributed their cancer to asbestos in the product. The court determined that improper scientific testimony had swayed the original decision. This case will get tried again, and the verdict may be even higher.\n\nSeptember 21, 2023: New MDL Judge Signals Need For Another Science Day\n\nNew MDL judge means another Science Day. What is a Science Day? The primary purpose of a Science Day is to provide the judge with a comprehensive understanding of the scientific, medical, and technical issues central to the litigation.\n\nThis is especially important in cases like the talc lawsuits, where the underlying facts and scientific evidence are complex and may significantly impact the outcome of the cases.\n\nBoth parties, plaintiffs and defendants, are usually allowed to make presentations. These presentations may include expert witnesses, scientific studies, research findings, and other evidence related to the case. The presentations aim to clarify complex scientific concepts and give the judge a balanced view of the scientific evidence.\n\nScience Days are supposed to be non-adversarial in nature. The goal is to educate the judge rather than argue the case. Of course, lawyers are always trying to advance the interests of their clients. So it is subtle adversarial. This event is anticipated to take place in either November or December\n\nSeptember 1, 2023: J&J Continues To Delay Litigation\n\nJ&J has delay tactics down to an art form. The latest? J&J wants to reargue expert witness challenges that were already decided by the previous MDL judge, who has since retired. It is a silly argument and likely to go nowhere. But it costs everyone time.\n\nAugust 14, 2023: New Jersey Bankruptcy Judge Dismisses J&J\u2019s Subsidiary Bankruptcy Case\n\nOn Friday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan in Trenton, New Jersey, officially dismissed Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talc subsidiary\u2019s second bankruptcy case.\n\nBut as our August 3rd update below foreshadowed, the judge did not accede to the request of plaintiffs\u2019 talc powder lawyers for a six-month prohibition on future bankruptcy filings by the company.\n\nSo presumably, J&J can file for bankruptcy a third time, which is completely insane. But J&J may not even try at this point.\n\nAugust 15, 2023: J&J Will Not Be Barred From Attempting Third Bankruptcy Filing\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan ruled this week that J&J and its talcum powder subsidiary, LTL Management, will not be barred from attempting a third bankruptcy filing. After the second LTL bankruptcy filing was rejected earlier this month, lawyers for the talcum plaintiffs asked the Judge to issue an order preventing J&J and LTL from filing any more bankruptcies for the next 6-months. That request was denied. J&J has not commented on whether it intends to file again.\n\nAugust 4, 2023: Judge Dismisses Motion To Bar Attorney From Acting As Representative For Future Meso Claims\n\nThe New Jersey bankruptcy judge overseeing Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Chapter 11 efforts to resolve talc claims dismissed a motion by a law firm to bar attorney Randi S. Ellis from acting as the representative for future mesothelioma claims, sharply stating that the request \u201clacks any legal or factual basis.\u201d\n\nAugust 1, 2023: J&J Expected To Pivot Strategy\n\nAfter its second bankruptcy application was dismissed, J&J is starting to realize bankruptcy is not a path and is assessing other legal options to address the thousands of cancer claims linked to its talc-based products. So what is the plan? Possible courses of action include settling individual claims, negotiating with law firms representing plaintiffs, or pursuing a global settlement. A global settlement would really be hard to pull off, and J&J knows there are likely law firms out there who are willing to take smaller settlement amounts to get this done now. Our lawyers think the most likely scenario is that J&J looks to settle cases with individual law firms. Cutting back on the number of claims would be a relief for J&J stockholders.\n\nJuly 29, 2023: J&J\u2019s Second Attempt At Chapter 11 Dismissed\n\nBig news yesterday. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talc unit\u2019s second attempt to address thousands of talc injury claims through Chapter 11 bankruptcy was dismissed by a New Jersey bankruptcy judge.\n\nThe judge ruled that the company did not meet the standards for financial distress required for the bankruptcy case to proceed. The first Chapter 11 filing of J&J\u2019s subsidiary debtor, LTL Management LLC, was also dismissed on the same financial distress grounds in a January ruling by the Second Circuit.\n\nThis gives the plaintiffs more leverage in settlement negotiations. J&J just needs to put up more billions. It is as simple as that.\n\nJuly 21, 2023: J&J Proposed Global Settlement Of $8.9 Billion\n\nJ&J recently proposed a global settlement of the talcum powder lawsuits for a total payout of $8.9 billion. That proposal currently has the support of a large segment of talc plaintiffs and their lawyers, pushing other plaintiffs to sign off also.\n\nThe $18.8 million awarded in the California talc trial earlier this week could undermine the push to win approval of the $8.9 settlement deal. Why? Because victims are more likely to seek just compensation \u2013 which our lawyers do not think this deal does \u2013 when they see a significant verdict. The verdict marks yet another big win for a talc plaintiff at trial, and it will likely reinforce the view held by many plaintiffs that $8.9 billion is a lowball offer for the resolution of nearly 38,000 claims.\n\nJuly 19, 2023: California Jury Awards $18.8 Million In Damages\n\nEarlier this week, a jury in California awarded $18.8 million in damages to a 24-year-old man who claimed that his long-time use of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder caused him to develop a deadly mesothelioma cancer. This marks the verdict in a talcum powder case since J&J tried to spin its talc liabilities off into bankruptcy.\n\nJuly 16, 2023: Law Firm Requests Disqualification Of Attorney From Representing Future Claimants\n\nA law firm representing mesothelioma patients has requested the disqualification of attorney Randi S. Ellis from representing future claimants in the bankruptcy case of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talc liability unit. Ms. Ellis makes $1,015 an hour representing the interests of potential victims who have not yet brought a claim.\n\nThe request is based on allegations that Ellis was photographed having a meal \u2013 a stake dinner, apparently \u2013 with J&J\u2019s chief negotiator and two ad hoc committee members supporting the bankruptcy plan. The law firm argues this raises concerns about impropriety and Ellis\u2019 ability to fulfill her fiduciary duties.\n\nJuly 11, 2023: Closing Statements Completed In California\u2019s Baby Powder Lawsuit\n\nClosing statements are completed in California\u2019s baby powder asbestos lawsuit. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney argues that J&J ignored medical data as early as 1998, when the plaintiff was born, showing a potential threat of asbestos in its talc products. They argue that J&J\u2019s failure to act at that point led to Hernandez\u2019s exposure and eventual illness. The plaintiff is seeking between $40 million and $50 million in compensatory damages plus another $450 million in punitive damages. Outlandish damages in many cases. Not this one.\n\nJuly 10, 2023: J&J Subsidiary Lodged Lawsuit Against Three Doctors\n\nLTL Management LLC, a bankrupt talc unit of Johnson & Johnson, has lodged a lawsuit against three doctors \u2013 plaintiff\u2019s experts in talc lawsuits \u2013 claiming they hurt its business by publishing articles asserting a connection between talc use and mesothelioma, using what LTL refers to as \u201cjunk science.\u201d\n\nThis follows a similar pattern of lawsuits by LTL in its initial bankruptcy proceedings, all dismissed following the dismissal of the bankruptcy itself. LTL was established to manage the influx of claims against J&J\u2019s talc products, believed to contain asbestos and linked to diseases such as ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.\n\nJ&J is sending a message to plaintiffs\u2019 experts everywhere it will sue if it does not like your scientific conclusions. The unfortunate thing is these doctors have to mount a legal defense, which means they lose even when they ultimately win. But the bigger problem is the chilling effect J&J seems to be looking for that tells doctors to tread lightly when taking positions big companies will not like. We all have an interest in as much science as possible coming to the marketplace of ideas.\n\nJune 28, 2023: J&J\u2019s Talc Unit Goes To Trial On Motions To Dismiss Chapter 11 Case\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s bankrupt talc unit recently went to trial on motions to dismiss its Chapter 11 case. During the trial, executives of the unit testified about the financial support provided by J&J.\n\nThe unit signed a new funding agreement with J&J because the first agreement was no longer enforceable. The new funding agreement provides financial support for an $8.9 billion settlement proposal. This is a little like asking the barber how often you should get a haircut. If we continue with jury trials, the real liability risk is more than double that settlement offer.\n\nThe trial is ongoing, and it is unclear whether the court will dismiss the case. It should. The 3rd Circuit was clear this is not a proper use of bankruptcy, no matter how J&J keeps repackaging it.\n\nJune 27, 2023: California Mesothelioma Plaintiff Provides Testimony On Consequences Of Cancer Diagnosis\n\nIn the ongoing Alameda County, California J&J baby powder mesothelioma trial, the plaintiff provided poignant testimony about the horrific consequences of his cancer diagnosis, which he attributes to his lifelong use of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (JNJ.N) baby powder. The 24-year-old emotionally conveyed to the jury of the unimaginable horror of being diagnosed with mesothelioma at such a young age. Regardless of where you stand on the case\u2019s merits, what this man has endured is genuinely awful. His critical point is that if he had known the risks of using talc powder, he would not have used it.\n\nPlaintiffs have established strong scientific evidence of the link between mesothelioma and talc powder. J&J will now have its chance to put on its case. This is a tough case for J&J and such a crucial juncture in this litigation. It is hard to understand why they have not made a reasonable settlement offer in this case given the implications on its $8.9 billion settlement offer.\n\nJune 14, 2023: New Jersey Bankruptcy Judge Postpones Key Decisions\n\nA New Jersey bankruptcy judge postponed key decisions in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s bankrupt talc subsidiary, LTL Management LLC\u2019s Chapter 11 case. The judge awaits an upcoming trial before ruling on ending LTL\u2019s exclusive right to propose a Chapter 11 plan. After their first case was dismissed, LTL refiled for Chapter 11, proposing an $8.9 billion settlement fund for cancer and mesothelioma claimants alleging asbestos exposure from talc products that we think is unlikely to get approval from enough victims. The hope is that Judge Kaplan follows the spirit of the 3rd Circuit\u2019s opinion and dismisses the bankruptcy, which is exactly what just happened in the 3M MDL when 3M tried the same stunt.\n\nJune 2, 2023: Technical Glitches Interrupt Opening Statements In Asbestos Talc Trial\n\nDuring the asbestos talc trial in California yesterday, some technical glitches interrupted the opening statement by the defense attorneys. The jurors, attending from home on Zoom, did hear Johnson & Johnson\u2019s lawyer expressing skepticism about the 70s science asserting the presence of asbestos in their product before the opening was abruptly ended.\n\nMeanwhile, the plaintiff was able to present their first witness, Arthur Langer. Langer explained that the occurrence of other minerals alongside talc is inevitable. He testified that his team informed J&J in 1971 about the presence of chrysotile asbestos in the company\u2019s talc, albeit at less than 0.1 percent. He also discovered more asbestos in 1976.\n\nJune 1, 2023: New Mesothelioma Trial Underway\n\nThe first trial since J&J decided to spin off its talc division and declare bankruptcy marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing talc litigation saga. The trial began yesterday in the poignant case of a young 24-year-old plaintiff, diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of mesothelioma last year, a diagnosis lawyers on both sides agree is a grave tragedy.\n\nOpening statements laid bare stark differences in each side\u2019s narrative. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney took aim at Johnson & Johnson, alleging the use of deceptive tactics in research practices and throughout the litigation process. According to the attorney, the company tried to manipulate the definition of asbestos, despite internal documents from 1978 and 1994 showing that fibers discovered in the plaintiff\u2019s tissue were included.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s precarious $8.9 billion settlement offer hangs in the balance with the progression of this trial. Despite the unique nature of this mesothelioma case and its distinct issues compared to most talcum powder lawsuits, a verdict favoring the plaintiff could inflict a serious setback to J&J\u2019s hopes for broad acceptance of their proposed settlement among plaintiffs.\n\nMay 31, 2023: J&J Subsidiary Defends Second Chapter 11 Filing\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s bankrupt talc unit vigorously defended its second Chapter 11 filing in the face of challenges from talc injury claimants. In an objection submitted to the New Jersey bankruptcy court, the subsidiary argued that the case was fundamentally different from the previous filing. It emphasized the unprecedented commitment of $8.9 billion from J&J, the largest settlement ever in a mass tort bankruptcy case. Not mentioned: how the size of the settlement means it is a fair settlement. J&J also claimed support from numerous plaintiffs\u2019 law firms representing over 60,000 claimants. This is hard to verify but likely incorrect.\n\nMay 24, 2023: California Mesothelioma Trial Set To Start Jury Selection\n\nSince Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 2021 bankruptcy filing, the first trial concerning its cosmetic talc products allegedly containing asbestos is set to start jury selection on Monday in California in Alameda County Superior Court, a historically good jurisdiction for plaintiffs. The plaintiff claims that his mesothelioma was caused by asbestos exposure from J&J\u2019s products, an allegation the company denies. The trial also involves six retailers accused of selling talc-containing products.\n\nMay 22, 2023: Future Claims Representative Appointment\n\nLawyers in the 2nd J&J talc bankruptcy are now battling over who should be appointed to the position of future claims representative, a role that is critically important to resolving the talc claims. Randi Ellis, a lawyer who frequently appears in MDLs across the country, was appointed as the claims representative in the first bankruptcy. J&J\u2019s defense team wants Ellis to be appointed to that role again, but lawyers for the talc plaintiffs are objecting on the grounds that Ellis has a conflict of interest that should prevent her from assuming that position again. The conflict stems from the fact that Ellis was apparently involved in drafting the hotly contested second bankruptcy, which raises concerns about her ability to be neutral. The reality is this bankruptcy is likely to get dismissed anyway.\n\nMay 17, 2023: J&J Continues Efforts To Settle Through Bankruptcy\n\nThe pretend company that J&J made up for the talc litigation bankruptcy told a New Jersey bankruptcy court that they have designated $400 million to settle the claims made by states accusing the company of deceptive advertising for its talc products. So that makes it an $8.5 billion settlement for cancer victims. It is hard to imagine a scenario where J&J can push these baby powder settlements through at these numbers. While J&J\u2019s proposed $8.5 billion offer sounds like a lot of money at first, it does not look great when you do the math. This settlement proposal \u2013 by our rough calculations \u2013 would not pay victims much more than an average settlement $100,000 per case. That is not enough.\n\nMay 15, 2023: J&J Faces Potential New Lawsuit From Cancer Victims Advocacy Group\n\nJ&J is potentially facing a lawsuit from an advocacy group representing cancer victims. The group contends that J&J intentionally withdrew a $61.5 billion funding agreement with its subsidiary, LTL Management LLC, to simulate financial distress and validate the unit\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The group asserts this action is equivalent to a fraudulent transfer of the victims\u2019 compensation rights. They plan to explore J&J\u2019s actions in the wake of the dismissal of LTL\u2019s first bankruptcy case.\n\nMay 10, 2023: New Order Requiring Attempt At Settlement Mediation\n\nNext week, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey will hear oral arguments on a motion to dismiss the second bankruptcy filing by J&J subsidiary LTL Management. In the meantime, however, the bankruptcy has issued an Order requiring both sides to take part in a new settlement mediation in the hope that a global settlement deal can brokered.\n\nMay 5, 2023: Talc Suppliers File For Bankruptcy\n\nTalc supplier Whittaker, Clark & Daniels filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to numerous lawsuits alleging its talc products caused cancer from asbestos exposure. Over 2,700 individuals have sued the company, and it was spending $1 million a month on legal defense. The company\u2019s recent $29 million verdict in South Carolina forced it to seek bankruptcy protection, arguing for equitable distribution of assets among talc claimants instead of being seized by the receiver. Other talc suppliers have also filed for bankruptcy due to litigation.\n\nMay 4, 2023: Bankruptcy Judge Directs J&J To Restart Settlement Discussions\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan has directed Johnson & Johnson to restart settlement discussions with lawyers who turned down the company\u2019s proposed $8.9 billion settlement offer. In Trenton, New Jersey yesterday, the parties appeared in court to discuss the next steps for the second bankruptcy case, and Judge Kaplan pushed more settlement talks.\n\nThis is the answer to resolve these claims for J&J. A baby powder settlement can get done. But it will require more money \u2013 more billions of dollars \u2013 from Johnson & Johnson.\n\nLawyers are split on whether to accept the proposal and not every client sees the issue the same way their attorney does. The second bankruptcy case is bound to go nowhere, and Judge Kaplan has scheduled a hearing in June to determine whether to dismiss the bankruptcy for the second time.\n\nMay 1, 2023: Relative Size Of $8.9 Billion Settlement\n\nOne question people keep asking is how could plaintiffs and their lawyers turn down $8.9 billion. Of course, that is a lot of money. But there are a lot of victims. And these are really good cases for plaintiffs. We were reminded of this recently with two talc trials resulting in big verdicts for the plaintiffs. In February, a talcum powder mesothelioma trial in Oregon resulted in a verdict of $18.1 million. A month later, another talc mesothelioma case went to trial in South Carolina and resulted in a verdict of $29 million for the plaintiff. The defendant in both cases was Whittaker, Clark & Daniels Inc., one of the leading suppliers of talc in the U.S.\n\nApril 30, 2023: J&J Increases Offer To $8.9 Billion\n\nWhen J&J initially attempted to pull the talcum powder litigation into bankruptcy, it came with an offer to set aside $2 billion for settlements. The amount was absurdly low. None of the talc plaintiffs supported it. This time around, however, J&J has increased the offer to $8.9 if the talc plaintiffs will allow a bankruptcy settlement and they also have the support of a large segment of the talc plaintiffs and their lawyers. But 75% of the talc plaintiffs, which is required for bankruptcy plan approval, is a tough road with so many lawyers with large inventories of baby powder lawsuits opposed to the settlement.\n\nWhat could solve the impasse? More billions.\n\nApril 25, 2023: Plaintiffs\u2019 Lawyers And Victims Divided Over Settlement Offer\n\nTalc cancer claimants have asked a judge to dismiss the Chapter 11 case filed by LTL Management LLC, a ridiculously made-up Johnson & Johnson subsidiary, saying the company is not financially distressed. LTL filed for Chapter 11 to settle tens of thousands of claims that J&J\u2019s baby powders caused cancer. The 3rd Circuit dismissed its first Chapter 11 case in January, saying the company was not eligible for bankruptcy relief as it failed to show financial distress.\n\nThe claimants argue that LTL\u2019s second Chapter 11 case is an abuse of the bankruptcy system and that it is being pursued in bad faith. J&J claims the bankruptcy settlement has \u201csignificant support\u201d from firms representing an estimated 60,000 claimants. It is fair to say plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and victims are divided over the $8.9 billion settlement offer.\n\nApril 21, 2023: Judge Rules J&J Must Face New Lawsuits\n\nA bankruptcy judge ruled that Johnson & Johnson must face new lawsuits alleging that the company sold tainted baby powder causing cancer. Although trials for talc lawsuits are paused for at least 60 days, new lawsuits can be filed, and lawyers can begin preparing their cases. The judge expressed skepticism over J&J\u2019s ridiculous effort to revive its strategy with a second bankruptcy case.\n\nApril 13, 2023: Split Opinions On How To Respond To $8.9 Billion Offer\n\nThe big news is the $8.9 billion over 25 years settlement offer. Lawyers representing cancer victims in the MDL class action have vowed to fight the settlement with talc claimants. Why? They think it is not enough money for 70,000 victims who have cancer. These lawyers argue that J&J should negotiate a larger settlement or litigate individual claims if the latest bankruptcy is dismissed.\n\nBut there is another group of lawyers outside of the leadership in the class action. These lawyers have collectively amassed tens of thousands of cases. This group wants to settle now for what many argue is less than these victims deserve. Their argument seems to be twofold. First, they argue the settlement \u2013 about an average of $100,000 per plaintiff \u2013 is fair.\n\nThat is a hard argument to make. But their second argument has more teeth: victims can no longer wait and want their money now.\n\nApril 12, 2023: J&J Second Attempt At Bankruptcy Explained\n\nPeople are asking how J&J can file for bankruptcy again. The answer is complex and convoluted. But let\u2019s try to explain it simply.\n\nJohnson & Johnson asserts that bankruptcy is the only means to address both present and future talc lawsuits conclusively. In other words, it thinks it will pay less if there is a bankruptcy component that applies pressure for a settlement. Driving past 400 years of American history, the company argues that bankruptcy benefits all parties by distributing settlement payments more equitably and efficiently than trial courts, where some litigants receive significant awards while others receive nothing.\n\nThe gist of the 3rd Circuit decision was this is not a case \u2013 a profitable company making a subsidiary to take the legal liability and declare bankruptcy \u2013 Congress contemplated when drafting the Bankruptcy Code. But it also said that the subsidiary was not in financial distress because J&J promised unlimited funding.\n\nSo J&J jumped on the unlimited funding part of the holding and did not promise to provide unlimited funding for litigation. The company claims that its revised financing arrangements with its subsidiary address the appeals court\u2019s concerns while still supplying funds for claim payments. As if offering victims less money would solve the overarching problem.\n\nAttorneys representing cancer victims who oppose the agreement counter this with what you conclude is countering legal nonsense with legal nonsense: J&J fraudulently transferred $50 billion in assets away from LTL Management to circumvent the appeals court\u2019s previous ruling. Hyperbole was not spared: victims\u2019 lawyers call it the largest \u201cfraudulent transfer in United States history.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the legal mumbo jumbo, J&J does not really think this bankruptcy will survive. But it is a way of trying to push this $8.9 billion settlement and keep pressure on plaintiffs.\n\nApril 10, 2023: New Bloomberg Article Concerning New Law In New Jersey\n\nBloomberg has an interesting article on a new law in New Jersey that is shedding new light on litigation funding in the baby powder class action lawsuit. Litigation funders Virage Capital Management and TRGP Capital invested in hundreds of claims against Johnson & Johnson (J&J) over talc products in exchange for a portion of any winnings. J&J is now offering to pay $8.9 billion to settle all lawsuits.\n\nThe funders\u2019 involvement is public information due to a New Jersey court rule requiring the disclosure of certain information about outside funding backers. The rule aims to address the growing calls for regulation of litigation funders. J&J faces over 60,000 claims when you add up state and federal baby powder lawsuits. Third-party funding in mass tort claims has pros and cons. But there is no question that we are seeing how third-party funding can level the playing field between individuals and large corporations in court.\n\nApril 4, 2023: Third Circuit Denies J&J\u2019s Request To Continue Automatic Stay\n\nIt is enjoyable to see the worm turn in this litigation. J&J took another hit this week when the Third Circuit denied J&J\u2019s request to continue the automatic stay while J&J appeals a bankruptcy ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. The automatic stay has frozen thousands of talcum powder cases and prevented new lawsuits from getting filed ever since J&J initiated the controversial effort to spin the talc liabilities off into a bankrupt subsidiary over a year ago. When the 3rd Circuit ruled that this bankruptcy was not valid a few months ago, the stay was removed. J&J was hoping to have it continued pending the SCOTUS appeal. But the answer was no.\n\nApril 1, 2023: J&J To Appeal To The Supreme Court\n\nJohnson & Johnson announced it will appeal its 3rd Circuit bankruptcy loss to the U.S. Supreme Court last week. Any chance the Supreme Court is even willing to hear the appeal? Not really.\n\nFebruary 25, 2023: Tennessee Congressman Urges Investigation Into Cost Of J&J Talc Products For U.S. Government\n\nA congressman from Tennessee is now demanding that the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) launch an investigation into how much J&J talc products have cost the government over the years.\n\nIn a recent letter to the GAO, Rep. Steven Cohen (D-Ten.) accused J&J of ignoring the dangers of its talc products for years while tax dollars were spent treating those injured by exposure to the products. The demand comes just weeks after J&J\u2019s significant loss in the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nJ&J needs to start making reasonable settlement offers to victims to begin to put all of this behind it. It is a stain on one of the world\u2019s greatest companies.\n\nFebruary 14, 2023: Bankruptcy Judge Announces Intention To Dismiss J&J Case\n\nAt a hearing today in New Jersey, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan announced his intention in light of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling to dismiss the bankruptcy case.\n\nFebruary 8, 2023: New Judge In Talcum Powder MDL\n\nIn the latest MDL 2738 update, we report a new beginning in the talc powder litigation: a new judge. Following the retirement of Judge Freda L. Wolfson, who had presided over the baby powder litigation, the JPML Panel appointed U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp to preside over the second act of this litigation. It seems fitting to have a new judge as we restart the baby powder class action lawsuit. Judger Wolfson controlled the talc MDL for seven years.\n\nJanuary 31, 2023: Post Concerning 3rd Circuit Baby Powder Bankruptcy Ruling\n\nOur post on the 3rd Circuit baby powder bankruptcy ruling.\n\nJanuary 30, 2023: Third Circuit Rejects J&J\u2019s Attempt At Bankruptcy\n\nThe Third Circuit rejected J&J\u2019s attempt to dump off its mounting talcum powder liability into bankruptcy. In an opinion issued today, the court dismissed the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filed by a subsidiary of J&J created to offload its growing talc liabilities. J&J\u2019s stock dropped 3% on the news, the most significant single-day dip in over two years. J&J has already vowed to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nJanuary 2, 2023: Prediction Concerning 3rd Circuit Court\u2019s Decision On J&J Bankruptcy\n\nLess of an update than a prediction. The 3rd Circuit will reject J&J\u2019s bankruptcy gambit in February. J&J will appeal to the Supreme Court but settle these lawsuits in massive numbers before the claims are resolved. (Arguably, this is more of a hope than a prediction. But we are excited about the possibility of progress in 2023 in this litigation after years of quicksand.)\n\nDecember 25, 2022: 3rd Circuit Oral Arguments\n\nRewatching the 3rd Circuit oral arguments today. It is worth a watch. It is well-argued on both sides, and this is a strong panel of judges. You don\u2019t get the impression that this panel of judges will allow this \u201cbankruptcy to avoid bankruptcy\u201d to stand. But that could be my bias talking.\n\nDecember 22, 2022: Hair Relaxer Lawsuits In Regard To Ovarian Cancer\n\nHair relaxer lawsuits are being filed around the country by women who claim injuries from chemical hair straighteners. One injury that interests women in the talcum powder litigation is relaxer-induced ovarian cancer. There is good science to support these claims.\n\nOctober 1, 2022: New Yorker Article\n\nThis New Yorker article on J&J is a great read.\n\nSeptember 27, 2022: Mediator Told To Report To Judge Before Weather Gets Cold\n\nAlso, the mediator hoping to facilitate a resolution to get settlement payouts to victims was told to report to the judge before \u201cthe weather gets cold.\u201d\n\nI was cold today.\n\nSeptember 20, 2022 Update: Judges\u2019 Skeptical Litigation Advantage Is Not Motivating J&J\n\nYesterday, a 3-judge panel at the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia heard oral arguments in the appeal challenging the validity of J&J\u2019s controversial effort to spin off its talcum powder liabilities into bankruptcy. J&J created a new corporate entity called LTL Management, transferred all the talc liabilities to it, and then LTL promptly filed bankruptcy.\n\nThe issue on appeal is whether this was permissible or whether the bankruptcy spin-off was filed in bad faith and should be dismissed. The panel of judges hit J&J\u2019s attorney with many challenging questions.\n\nOne of those questions was whether the bankruptcy was for an advantage in the litigation. How could J&J lawyers pretend that was not the impetus for the bankruptcy filing? Somehow, they did, arguing that the advantage is a byproduct of a more overarching goal.\n\nThe judges seemed skeptical and raised many mass tort lawyers\u2019 concerns that allowing this bankruptcy would spark a wave of similar bankruptcy filings (like the 3M earplug claims) by financially solvent companies looking to shed litigation liabilities.\n\nThe results of this ruling will have a tangible impact on talcum powder settlement amounts. If the bankruptcy holds, victims will still get settlement compensation payouts. But they are likely to be lower if the risk of colossal jury awards is not hanging over J&J\u2019s head and they can resolve these claims in bankruptcy court.\n\nOur baby powder lawyers are hoping the 3rd Circuit gets this right. The purpose of our bankruptcy laws for a company seeking insolvency \u2013 is to protect creditors. Instead, J&J is trying to use the Bankruptcy Code as a litigation management device for a company worth nearly $500 billion. That cannot be the purpose of bankruptcy.\n\nWhen will J&J Settle the Remaining Talcum Powder Lawsuits?\n\nContact Miller & Zois to File a Talcum Powder Lawsuit\n\nIt is NOT too late to file your talcum powder lawsuit \u2013 at least not for many of you.

Valued at a market cap of $366.3 billion, the company operates through pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer products divisions.\n\nThis healthcare giant\u2019s shares have significantly lagged behind the broader market over the past 52 weeks. JNJ has declined 3% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has gained 20.9%. Nevertheless, the stock is up 5% on a YTD basis, compared to SPX\u2019s 1.9% rise during the same time frame.\n\nZooming in further, Johnson & Johnson has underperformed the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLV) 3.8% return over the past 52 weeks and 7.2% gain on a YTD basis.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s weak performance over the past 52 weeks has been driven by several challenges, including slowing sales in its MedTech segment, particularly in China, patent expiration of its blockbuster drug, Stelara, and over 62,000 ongoing talc-related legal cases. Nonetheless, on Jan. 13, shares of JNJ surged 1.7% after the company announced plans to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies for $14.6 billion. For JNJ, this acquisition is a good way to bolster its pipeline and strengthen its neurological business in the long run.\n\nHowever, on Jan. 22, shares of JNJ plunged 1.9% after its Q4 earnings release, despite delivering better-than-expected Q4 adjusted earnings of $2.04 per share and revenues of $22.5 billion. The top line rose 5.3% from the year-ago quarter, while earnings declined 10.9% year-over-year. Strong growth in its Innovative Medicines unit, with sales of key drug Darzalex beating estimates, aided the results and overshadowed the decline in revenues from its key drugs, Stelara and Imbruvica. But what disappointed investors the most was its fiscal 2025 sales guidance. The company expects sales in the range of $89.2 billion-$90 billion, which came in below estimates.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect JNJ\u2019s EPS to grow 6% year over year to $10.58. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is promising. It surpassed the Wall Street estimates in each of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 22 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d which is based on eight \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d two \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and 12 \u201cHold\u201d ratings.\n\nThis configuration is slightly more bullish than three months ago, with seven analysts suggesting a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating.\n\nOn Feb. 3, Jefferies maintained a \u201cNeutral\u201d rating on JNJ and raised its price target to $166, which indicates a 9.3% potential upside from the current levels.\n\nThe mean price target of $169.45 represents an 11.6% upside from JNJ\u2019s current price levels, while the Street-high price target of $190 suggests an upside potential of 25.1%.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company that started in the early 1870s. Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nConservative backlash has brought Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s budget plans to a halt, offering an early sign of the struggle Republicans will face as they try to muscle President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda through a narrowly divided Congress.\n\nHouse GOP leaders are struggling to coalesce behind a budget blueprint that will mark the first step toward delivering Trump\u2019s agenda, as some hardliners demanded hundreds of billions more in cuts and more details about how to pay for Trump\u2019s tax cuts. GOP leaders believe they will, ultimately, get consensus to move ahead, but the disagreement is \u2014 for now \u2014 halting Johnson\u2019s plans to move ahead with the first committee vote on Trump\u2019s big border, tax and energy package this week.\n\n\u201cThe American people gave us the gavel for a reason,\u201d said Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, a member of the House budget panel who is among those seeking more cuts. \u201cEverybody wants to cut until it\u2019s time to cut.\u201d\n\nJohnson plans to huddle with several key Republicans on Tuesday night as they chart a path forward but said leaders haven\u2019t yet decided whether to move ahead with a committee vote on the budget measure this week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of this process. We\u2019re right on schedule,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not yet determined if we will be marking up this week or not. We\u2019re having an important meeting tonight with key figures on the committee and others to sort through it. But this is the deliberative process.\u201d\n\nPassing a budget blueprint is only a small piece of the GOP\u2019s challenge this year, since it is a non-binding document that includes no specifics about what will be in Trump\u2019s legislative package. But it\u2019s a critical step toward that final bill: Both the House and Senate must adopt the identical budget measures to unlock the procedural powers to allow Trump\u2019s agenda to bypass the Senate\u2019s filibuster.\n\nAnd Johnson will need to steer his conference through the politically fraught budget debate at a perilous time for the House GOP: Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York is set to resign from the chamber in the coming days, which will mean Republicans can\u2019t lose a single GOP vote \u2014 and Democrats are already scheming about how to stall her replacement.\n\nNorman and other conservatives had generally been on board with the budget plans that Johnson and other GOP leaders had presented at the conference\u2019s policy retreat last week. But problems quickly arose as those plans morphed into a physical document, according to multiple GOP lawmakers and senior aides familiar with the discussions.\n\nWhile GOP leaders had spoken generally at the Doral, Florida, retreat of a budget that outlined $2.5 trillion in savings, another proposal this week appeared to outline only about $300 billion in savings \u2014 by repealing Biden-era programs and adding tougher rules to programs like Medicaid \u2014 as well as $300 billion in new spending on border security and other national security measures. (Senior Republicans cautioned that precise details of the budget plan remain highly fluid.)\n\nConservatives did support those proposals, but they wanted more in cuts. GOP leaders offered to go higher, from roughly $300 billion in cuts to $500 billion to as much as $700 billion. But to Norman and others, it still wasn\u2019t enough. And there was another problem: GOP leadership wasn\u2019t proposing how to pay for Trump\u2019s big tax plans.\n\n\u201cNo one has put forward how we\u2019re paying for everything,\u201d one person familiar with the discussions told CNN.\n\nMembers of the House Budget Committee spoke on a conference call Sunday night and by Tuesday, it was clear the committee wasn\u2019t ready to release its budget blueprint or hold a vote on it this week as planned. People close to Republican leadership downplayed the impact of the delay, noting that Johnson\u2019s schedule had always been ambitious, if not aspirational.\n\nBut members of the House Freedom Caucus, including its chairman, Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, have already begun conversations with their Senate GOP colleagues, according to a person familiar with the conversations. Harris has been speaking to Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who could decide to leapfrog the House with his own budget proposal if the lower chamber doesn\u2019t act soon.\n\nIf that happens, it could mean further disruption of Trump\u2019s agenda. Many senators \u2014 including Graham \u2014 have suggested that Republicans should focus on passing a narrower version of Trump\u2019s agenda zeroing in on border and energy policy, and save the politically trickier tax bill for later. House GOP tax-writers, however, have ruled out that idea, arguing it would jeopardize the passage of those tax cuts.\n\nAsked on Tuesday whether the Senate should take the lead, Johnson told reporters, \u201cThe Senate will not take the lead. We\u2019re going to take the lead and we\u2019re right on schedule.\u201d\n\nFor now, House GOP leaders are working to rescue their own budget blueprint, rather than let the Senate move first. As lawmakers return to Washington on Tuesday night, Johnson and his team plan to resume the parade of one-on-one meetings they\u2019ve been having for weeks as they map out how to pass Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nJohnson and his team have been urging their more conservative members to support a less-aggressive budget blueprint \u2014 one that gives them flexibility to go after steeper spending if they are able, but also one that can realistically pass in a historically tiny majority.\n\nBut Norman scoffed at that idea. He said he would reject any \u201cshell\u201d budget because, in his words, with \u201cthe first puff of wind, it blows up.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThey want a starting block, but if you start that low, it\u2019s just a nonstarter.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

Her father is actor Don Johnson, and her mother is Melanie Griffith, an Academy Award-nominated actress. Tippi Hedren, her maternal grandmother, starred in several Alfred Hitchcock movies. While growing up, Dakota Johnson frequently traveled with her parents to filming locations, and from an early age she wanted to be an actress.\n\nEarly films: The Social Network and 21 Jump Street Johnson made her film debut in 1999, appearing in a minor role in Crazy in Alabama, a comedy that starred her mother and was directed by Antonio Banderas, her stepfather at the time. While her parents tried to dissuade her from an acting career, Johnson refused to be discouraged, and, weeks after graduating from high school, she landed a minor role in David Fincher\u2019s The Social Network (2010). The acclaimed drama centers on the creation of Facebook. Over the next couple of years, Johnson had supporting roles in several little-seen films, including Beastly (2011) and For Ellen (2012). More successful was the comedy 21 Jump Street (2012), about two police officers (played by Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill) who go undercover at a high school. In 2012 Johnson made her TV debut, starring in the family comedy Ben and Kate. However, it was canceled after one season. Johnson later appeared in the 2013 series finale of the popular sitcom The Office.",

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ, Financial) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-02-04, Johnson & Johnson's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $127.10. It's currently trading at a price of $151.87. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -19.49%. The company is fair valued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Johnson & Johnson's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $9.99 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.58%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 6.50%\n\nYears of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4%\n\nYears of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 80.13 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 46.97 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 127.10\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $90.43. This valuation indicates that the Johnson & Johnson is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -67.94%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.\n\nHere are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\n\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\n\nThe DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\n\nGrowth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\n\nThe model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance.

            "content": "Listen to the article 7 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe federal government could be getting more help in defending its interpretation of a decades-old drug discount program in court.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of hospitals filed a motion to intervene as defendants in Johnson and Johnson\u2019s lawsuit against the government for preventing the drugmaker from changing how it divvies out savings in the program, called 340B.\n\nJ&J said its plan to give hospitals rebates instead of upfront discounts on 340B-eligible drugs is necessary to prevent waste and abuse, while hospitals \u2014 and the government \u2014 maintain the plan is illegal.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIn the summer of 2024, J&J became the first pharmaceutical company to try to unilaterally reform how it distributes savings for drugs in the 340B program, which requires drugmakers to give hospitals that serve a large number of needy or vulnerable patients discounts on medication.\n\nInstead of giving hospitals a discount when they purchase eligible drugs \u2014 the accepted practice in 340B since the program was created in the early 1990s \u2014 J&J wants hospitals to purchase drugs at full price, submit a claim for rebate and then provide a rebate after that claim is certified.\n\nJ&J\u2019s plan would have initially applied to two of its most expensive and frequently prescribed drugs, plaque psoriasis treatment Stelara and blood thinner Xarelto.\n\nStill, the idea was quickly slammed by hospitals and the Health Resources and Services Administration, the HHS subagency that oversees 340B. According to HRSA, the law governing 340B requires drugmakers to discount drugs at the point of sale.\n\nHospitals added that J&J\u2019s plan would effectively result in them floating revenue to the drugmaker by paying a higher price for 340B medication with no certainty that they\u2019ll be made whole down the line. It would also put them on the hook for the financial and manpower burden of complying with data collection and reporting requirements for claims \u2014 not to mention potential legal fees from fighting any J&J denials of legitimate rebate claims in court, hospitals say.\n\nJ&J sued HRSA in November in a Washington, D.C. district court for blocking its plan.\n\nSince then, Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb, Sanofi and Novartis have all also sued HRSA over their right to put 340B rebates in place.\n\nIf the spate of lawsuits are successful, the rebate plans could cause \u201ccrippling damage to safety-net hospitals throughout the nation,\u201d said Maureen Testoni, the CEO of 340B Health, in a statement. 340B Health represents more than 1,500 hospitals in the 340B program.\n\nHospitals would have to divert resources to complying with the rebate requirements, pay \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d in extra costs to purchase drugs and assume \u201cenormous financial risk\u201d from drugmakers rejecting legitimate claims for rebates, Testoni said.\n\nNow, 340B Health and two safety-net hospitals \u2014 UMass Memorial Medical Center (UMMC) in Massachusetts and Genesis HealthCare System in Ohio \u2014 want to intervene in J&J\u2019s case to show the court the harm that would be caused if it allows J&J\u2019s rebate plan to take effect.\n\nUMMC estimates it would cost the system $24 million each year to purchase Stelara and Xarelto at full price upfront, not to mention almost $400,000 on staffing and legal fees to comply with the rebate requirements, according to a memo to the court supporting the hospitals\u2019 motion.\n\nGenesis would need to spend $300,000 each year to purchase Stelara and Xarelto at full price, and more than $200,000 to comply with the rebate requirements, according to the memo.\n\nIf J&J denies legitimate rebate claims, the financial hit to UMMC would threaten patient care initiatives funded by 340B, including free care for low-income patients and mobile care clinics. Genesis might have to roll back its patient drug assistance program, transportation programs and free community health programs, the memo says.\n\nLawyers for J&J plan to oppose the hospitals\u2019 motion to intervene, according to court documents.\n\nThe legal debate over J&J\u2019s rebate model is \u201climited to our company and HRSA,\u201d a spokesperson for the New Jersey-based drugmaker said over email.\n\nHRSA does not plan to take a stance on the motion. The agency did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDrugmakers and hospitals have long been at odds over 340B, as drugmakers aren\u2019t fans of the chunk that 340B discounts, which are generally 20% to 50% off list prices, takes out of their bottom lines.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry argues that hospitals haven\u2019t been good stewards of the program, pointing to data showing snowballing growth in how many providers are eligible to participate and in the volume of purchased drugs. Some lawmakers agree that 340B could use more oversight amid concerns that hospitals could be profiteering from the program.\n\nTension over 340B has frequently bubbled up in the courts.\n\nAlong with litigation filed in the past three months over rebate plans, drugmakers have also sued the government to try to restrict the number of pharmacies hospitals can contract with to distribute 340B drugs. Courts have generally sided with drugmakers in those suits. However, some states have passed laws stopping drugmakers from limiting hospitals\u2019 use of contract pharmacies.\n\nThe HHS under the Biden administration has championed the hospitals\u2019 perspective, but it\u2019s unclear what stance the department will have under President Donald Trump. Though hospitals defend the savings they receive under 340B as essential to preserving patient care, the program\u2019s exponential growth could make it a target of conservative efforts to rein in spending.\n\nThe American Legislative Exchange Council \u2014 a free market policy group backed by drug lobby PhRMA \u2014 argued 340B should be a target of reform last month.\n\nThe turnover in Washington has created some uncertainty that 340B Health, UMMC and Genesis acknowledged in their memo to the court.\n\n\u201cIntervention is particularly important here during the current change of administration because during such changes agencies and the Justice Department typically re-evaluate the positions they have previously taken,\u201d the memo reads.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other best cancer stocks to buy.\n\nOverview of the Global Oncology Sector\n\nCancer is the second leading cause of death across the globe, second to cardiovascular disease. According to data by the American Cancer Society released in January 2023, the United States was expected to have around 1,958,310 cancer patients by the end of 2023 alone. This reflects a 28% increase from 2010. More than 2 million new cases of cancer were likely to be diagnosed in the US in 2024, with more than 600,000 deaths from the ailment expected in the same year. Like the increasing number of cancer patients, the cost of treating cancer is on an upward trajectory as well. While it cost around $200 billion to treat cancer in the US in 2020, the total expense is anticipated to exceed $245 billion by 2030.\n\nAccording to the \u201cOncology Pharmaceuticals Market 2024\u201d report, global funding for cancer research has grown exponentially over the past two decades. The FDA approved 161 new cancer therapies between 2017 and 2022, which reflects the fast pace with which treatment in the field is advancing. These statistics make oncology one of the most comprehensive sectors of the life science space. The oncology sector covers the entire cancer care process, from diagnosis to treatment.\n\nPharmaceutical and biotech companies around the world are continuously striving to develop more effective cancer treatments. According to Fortune Business Insights, this endeavor is expected to continue increasing in magnitude in the coming future. The global oncology drugs market was valued at around $201.75 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3%, going from $220.80 billion in 2024 to $518.25 billion by 2032.\n\nSome of the primary factors driving the growth of the oncology drugs market include the advancements in targeted immunotherapies for cancer care and the increasing prevalence of cancer across the globe. This growth rate makes investment in oncology-related companies a lucrative bet. North America is the most dominant geographical region in the global oncology drugs market. It held a 45.92% market share in 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners and 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025.\n\nTrends in Precision Oncology\n\nThe precision oncology market reflects similar trends. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines precision oncology as a form of treatment where medical professionals choose treatments by keeping the DNA signature of an individual patient\u2019s tumor in view. Statistics from Grand View Research show that the global precision oncology market size was valued at $115.8 billion in 2024.",

The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\n\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partner across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\n\n\nThe Zack\u2019s analyst expect NVIDIA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 50.5% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the U.S.-China tech war remain major concerns.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-0.5% vs. +1%). The company\u2019s sales in the MedTech segment have slowed down due to headwinds in Asia-Pacific markets like China and competitive pressure in some categories. The launch of Stelara generics is expected to significantly erode the drug\u2019s sales in 2025. The uncertainty around its talc lawsuits remains.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, J&J beat Q4 estimates for earnings and sales. Its Innovative Medicine unit is showing a growth trend, driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada and continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli.\n\n\n\nJ&J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and has been on an acquisition spree lately, which has strengthened its pipeline. J&J has also made strong progress toward resolving the talc litigation.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Johnson & Johnson here >>>)\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+46.6% vs. +27.6%). The company reported impressive fourth-quarter 2024 results, with both the bottom and top lines surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company is benefiting from solid demand for postpaid services.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, the company added 6.1 million postpaid net customers while postpaid net account additions were 1.1 million, both metrics being the best in the industry. Solid growth in free cash flow accentuates efficient capital management and implies that the company is well-positioned to invest in growth initiatives and pay debt and dividends.\n\n\n\nHowever, owing to the stock\u2019s premium valuation, we believe investors should remain cautious as macroeconomic factors, market saturation, or economic downturns can significantly impact overvalued stocks like TMUS. Fierce competition is straining profitability. A high debt burden remains a concern.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on T-Mobile here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Eastern have outperformed the Zacks Security and Safety Services industry over the past year (+17% vs. +12.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $171.52 million demonstrates robust revenue growth, with net sales rising 6% year over year to $206.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, fueled by demand for truck mirror assemblies and transport packaging. Its 13% backlog growth highlights strong future sales potential. Gross margins improved to 25.2%.\n\n\n\nPortfolio realignment, including divesting Big 3 Mold, focuses resources on high-growth segments. The \u201cOne Eastern\u201d strategy enhances efficiency, supported by investments in Mexico and China for competitive scalability. Eastern\u2019s 337th consecutive dividend exemplifies financial stability and shareholder focus.\n\n\n\nHowever, challenges include a 54% drop in operating cash flow, rising SG&A expenses, elevated capital intensity, and inventory pressures. Debt increased to $41.5 million with rising leverage, amplifying interest rate risks.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company that started in the early 1870s. Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is one of the world's largest and most prominent healthcare leaders. If investing in a company came down to size, the stock would be a no-brainer buy. However, Johnson & Johnson has encountered legal and regulatory headwinds in the past few years, giving investors pause. Furthermore, revenue growth generally hasn't been impressive, nor has Johnson & Johnson's stock market performance. Is the pharmaceutical giant still worth investing in?\n\nThe case for Johnson & Johnson\n\nSome might describe Johnson & Johnson's business as boring, but sometimes, that's not such a bad thing. Selling pharmaceutical products is a steady and reliable business even when the economy is down, since patients never stop needing potentially lifesaving medicines.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nJohnson & Johnson's portfolio features more than 10 blockbuster drugs and spans several therapeutic areas, from infectious diseases to oncology.\n\nThe healthcare giant is also a leading medical device maker, which adds diversification to its operations. Johnson & Johnson's financial results are generally steady and consistent. Check out the chart of revenue and net income below.\n\nJNJ Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nJNJ Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nThe company's balance sheet is rock solid and has earned it an AAA credit rating from S&P, the highest available. While it's had not-so-impressive top-line growth in recent years, that could change in the long run, for at least two reasons.\n\nFirst, Johnson & Johnson split from its consumer health business in 2023. This unit had become a drag on its revenue growth, and by getting rid of it, the company will be able to invest more in its core pharmaceutical and medical device business, which should lead to stronger sales growth. The split's effect on Johnson & Johnson's business will become clearer as time goes by.\n\nSecond, Johnson & Johnson has several growth opportunities. One of them is within the robotic-assisted surgery industry. Johnson & Johnson is developing the Ottava system to compete in this market dominated by Intuitive Surgical. Though Ottava isn't yet approved in the U.S., it likely will be eventually, and it would then provide a key source of ongoing revenue to the company.So I'm optimistic Johnson & Johnson's financial results will remain solid.\n\nThe healthcare leader is also an excellent income stock. Johnson & Johnson has increased its dividend payout for 62 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King. Between Johnson & Johnson's strong underlying business and excellent dividend program, the stock may be a solid pick for long-term, income-seeking investors.\n\nCan the company overcome its obstacles?\n\nHeadwinds include thousands of talc-related lawsuits and a new law in the U.S. that gives Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. The first round of negotiations will target three of the company's medicines.\n\nRegarding the first issue, Johnson & Johnson is, through a subsidiary, proposing an $8 billion settlement that currently has the support of about 83% of eligible claimants and would resolve 99.75% of talc-related lawsuits against the company.\n\nWhile it's not a done deal, things might be moving in that direction. Of course, that $8 billion will come out of Johnson & Johnson's pockets -- but for a company that generates more than $80 billion in revenue every year, it's not the end of the world.\n\nConcerning the second problem, Johnson & Johnson has survived many regulatory changes in the past several decades. I'm confident the company has the flexibility to navigate this one, too. Johnson & Johnson's pipeline features almost 100 ongoing programs, so even if what it's paid for some drugs decreases, there are others to make up for that.\n\nWith more investments into pharmaceuticals following the separation of its consumer health segment, Johnson & Johnson's innovative capabilities will be enhanced.\n\nMy verdict\n\nJohnson & Johnson's headwinds are unquestionably worth monitoring. But even with these obstacles, the company's stock is an excellent choice for some investors. It's not for those looking for high-growth companies, but it is a reliable, blue chip stock that dividend investors will love.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Johnson & Johnson wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "Since then, equity markets have rebounded strongly, with earnings surging, particularly from Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Dividends, typically set by cautious boards, tend to lag behind earnings during these surges. As a result, payout ratios are now close to 25-year lows, meaning companies are paying out less than historical averages, as reported by J.P. Morgan. Simply returning to more typical payout levels could result in an additional 2% growth annually over the next five years. This recovery is already taking shape, as global dividend growth has outpaced earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters.\n\nThe main factor driving this increased dividend growth is the low starting point for payout ratios (dividends relative to earnings). In 2020, during the pandemic, an unusual number of companies reduced their dividends. In fact, global dividends dropped by 12%, a sharper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This response was reasonable given the uncertain environment.\n\nAccording to a report by J.P. Morgan, global equities are on the brink of a significant period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a more permanent increase in dividend momentum. Over the past two decades, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysts now predict this rate will accelerate to 7.6% in the future.\n\nDividends are a long-term investment strategy, and the benefits take time to materialize. For example, a dollar invested in the broader market in 1927 without reinvesting dividends would be worth $243 today, but if dividends were reinvested, that same dollar would be worth $3,737. Fortunately, you don\u2019t need a century to see the potential growth in dividend stocks, as the outlook for the near future is improving. According to a report by AGF Investments, in the second half of 2024, global monetary easing has led to lower bond yields, making fixed income less attractive compared to dividend-paying stocks. In addition, companies with high dividend payouts often have more leverage, and lower bond yields help them manage interest expenses, boosting their overall financial performance, which in turn would contribute to dividend growth.\n\nDuring a time of great excitement about AI-driven capital gains, it's crucial to remember that dividends have consistently played a vital role in total returns. Over the long term, dividends become even more significant. Looking back at the past few decades, approximately 55% of market returns from 1987 to the end of 2023 have come from reinvested dividends.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors and analysts both support companies that have raised their payouts. Companies that consistently raise their dividends typically manage economic downturns better because they have strong business models, solid balance sheets, and promising earnings potential. These qualities make them attractive to investors, and historical data shows that the market tends to reward them. Stocks of companies that increase dividends often outperform the broader market while experiencing lower volatility. According to a report by AGF Investments, the companies in the broader market that grew their dividend between January 1990 and August 2024 grew by 12.1%, compared with an 11% return of companies that pay no dividends and a 10.8% return of dividend cutters. With market conditions improving, it's not surprising that an increasing number of companies are beginning to pay dividends.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nTo compile this article, we first scanned a list of stocks known for their consistent dividend track records and sustained shareholder payouts over an extended period. This group reflects stability and long-term performance in dividend payouts. From this list, we picked 10 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

The acquisition will be funded through a combination of cash reserves and debt, with the transaction expected to be finalized later this year. This marks the most significant biotech acquisition in over a year, indicating a resurgence in healthcare mergers and acquisitions following a slowdown in 2024 when major pharmaceutical companies concentrated on integrating their previous post-pandemic purchases.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported its Q4 2024 earnings, recording $22.5 billion in revenue, reflecting a 5.2% increase from the same quarter the previous year. As a leading healthcare company, it continues to enhance treatment standards for conditions with significant unmet needs, such as multiple myeloma, lung cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and heart failure. Its MedTech segment experienced a 6.2% rise in global operational sales, with net acquisitions and divestitures contributing 1.5% to this growth. The Cardiovascular division benefited from strong demand for electrophysiology products and Abiomed, while the General Surgery segment saw growth driven by wound closure products.\n\nJohnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) dividend growth makes it a reliable investment option for income investors. The company has been growing its payouts for 62 consecutive years and currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company that started in the early 1870s. Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "On \"Gilligan's Island,\" romance always ran at a low ebb. Apart from Mr. and Mrs. Howell (Jim Backus and Natalie Schafer), there were no couples on the island, and none seemed to form over the course of the show. Indeed, several of the characters seemed too silly or childish to form anything approaching a real-life affair. Gilligan (Bob Denver) was too innocent, and the Skipper (Alan Hale) was more often thinking of engineering and survival than being charming. Ginger (Tina Louise) was often dressed in pretty gowns, and was certainly presented as a sex symbol, but was more concerned with fame and acting than flirting with any of the men or women around her.\n\nThe two \"normal\" characters on the island were Mary Ann (Dawn Wells) and the Professor (Russell Johnson), who often served as the show's \"straight man\" characters; they rarely got to have slapstick moments or pratfalls of their own. Because of their mutual function, many \"Gilligan's Island\" fans tended to ship the characters, if I may use modern parlance. If there was to be a new romantic pairing on Gilligan's Isle, it was to be between the Professor and Mary Ann. This notion was cemented by the fact that Wells' and Johnson's credits were listed together in the show's opening.\n\nViewers may have also been keying into the fact that Wells and Johnson were good friends off-camera. The two certainly had a lot of chemistry, and had a great deal of respect for one another. Wells would later admit that she had a huge crush on Johnson, although during their stint on \"Gilligan's Island,\" they were both married to other people, and had to keep their relationship distantly respectful.\n\nJohnson, while never admitting to a romantic attraction to Wells, did write in his autobiography \"Here on Gilligan's Isle\" (penned with Russell Cox), that he and his co-star did share what he called \"a mutual fondness.\"",

            "content": "Are Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson rivals? The two greats have gone head-to-head on quite a few occasions in their career. And yet, that hasn\u2019t affected their dynamic with each other. Mickelson and Johnson have always indulged in friendly banters to keep themselves amused on the course. That has not changed ever since they moved to LIV Golf as well. Despite captaining opposing sides, Johnson and Mickelson have been able to maintain a friendship throughout their time in the league.\n\nJust like the players, the fans also enjoy watching them go back and forth to keep their spirits high. One such incident was shared by DJ\u2019s caddie during a podcast involving all three individuals that was posted a few hours ago.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nHow did Dustin Johnson get back at Phil Mickelson?\n\nApart from the PGA Tour accomplishments, Phil Mickelson has also earned a reputation for being a great content creator. He has hosted quite a few shows and videos involving golf that have been much loved by fans for quite a few years. Back in mid-2019, Mickelson started a new series inspired by the former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s Fireside Chats. The series is known as Phireside with Phil. It was an immediate hit among the fans as they expressed wanting more of it after every video. Nearly 6 years later, Phil Mickelson released another episode of Phireside with Phil with Dustin Johnson and Austin Johnson as his guests.\n\nThe YouTube video posted a few hours ago featured Mickelson and the Johnson brothers as they shared stories from their interactions on the course. During one of the segments, Austin Johnson wanted to share a story about the kind of dynamic Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson share. The caddie mentioned how he always saw the two LIV Golf pros practicing at Augusta Nationals a few days before the tournament began.\n\nOn one such occasion before the 2019 Masters Tournament, Austin remembers how Mickelson, Johnson, and others had just teed off from the first hole. As the others walked down the hill, Mickelson saw an opening where he and the Johnson brothers were alone. That\u2019s when the 45x PGA Tour winner asked, \u201cDJ, you got any plans for dinner tonight?\u201d. Johnson innocently replied that he had chefs over for a steak night. However, he didn\u2019t realize what Mickelson was trying to say.\n\nHowever, Austin Johnson, hearing Mickelson laugh, realized that his brother was being teased for not being invited to the Champions dinner. The reason? Dustin Johnson had yet to win his first Masters Tournament. Austin recollected how Tiger Woods went on to win the title in 2019 before he moved on to a similar incident in 2020.\n\nWith Dustin Johnson winning the Masters Tournament, he tells his brother, \u201cI\u2019ll text Phil\u201d. Remembering the incident from a year ago, DJ adds, \u201cI told that mother****er what I\u2019m doing for dinner Tuesday night.\u201d And that\u2019s how Dustin Johnson got back at Phil Mickelson for his comments during the 2019 Masters Tournament.\n\nDJ clarified that he didn\u2019t want to start a tussle, but he then remembered how much Mickelson\u2019s comments bugged him. So after winning his green jacket, the first thing he could think of doing was to get back at the 54-year-old via text.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Grant Horvat (@granthorvat)\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nDustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson certainly seem to have a great friendship. This is not the first time the dynamic between the two has been on display for the fans. Mickelson had poked fun at Johnson a few days ago as well. Let\u2019s see what happened then.\n\nDid Phil Mickelson just call Dustin Johnson \u2018Dumb\u2019?\n\nA few days ago, Grant Horvat and Phil Mickelson teased their YouTube collaboration for an upcoming video. The short Instagram video post featured the two along with Dustin Johnson. Horvat asked Mickelson \u201cHow are you going to get in this guy\u2019s head?\u201d To this, the LIV Golf pro replied \u201cGrant, I\u2019ve been there. I\u2019ve looked around. There\u2019s nothing there.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nThe camera then pans toward an oblivious Dustin Johnson who asks \u201cWho are you guys talking about?\u201d The teaser seems to clearly suggest that Phil Mickelson told Grant Horvat that Dustin Johnson is \u2018dumb\u2019. One might wonder how they convinced the DJ to be a part of the video. But this again goes to show the great dynamic between Mickelson and Johnson.\n\nDid you like seeing this side of Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson\u2019s friendship? Let us know in the comments section.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.36%) has a diverse healthcare business, and investors often look to it as a safe dividend stock to invest in for the long term. One area where it has been lacking, however, is growth. The company's growth is often in the single digits and with top-selling drug Stelara losing patent protection and its sales already declining, investors are concerned about J&J's long-term growth prospects. As a result, the stock has been a largely underwhelming buy of late, with its shares down 5% over the past 12 months.\n\nRecently, however, the company announced a big acquisition, which may lead to much more future growth. Could now be the time to invest in this struggling healthcare stock?\n\nJohnson & Johnson to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies\n\nOn Jan. 13, Johnson & Johnson announced plans to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies for $14.6 billion. That's a significant investment that suggests the company is getting some promising assets in this deal, which is definitely the case.\n\nThe biopharmaceutical company creates medicines aimed at treating neurological conditions. Its key product, Caplyta, is an approved treatment for schizophrenia and depression related to bipolar I or II disorder. It may also soon obtain approval for major depressive disorder. The blockbuster drug could generate over $5 billion in sales at its peak. Intra-Cellular also has other therapies in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In the trailing 12 months, the company has reported nearly $613 million in revenue and it has incurred losses totaling $86 million over that time frame.\n\nJohnson & Johnson expects the deal will close later this year. For the healthcare giant, the acquisition is a good way to bolster its pipeline and strengthen its neurological business in the long run.\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson look cheap\n\nJohnson & Johnson is normally a good buy for its dividend and the stability it offers. Over the past five years, however, the stock has risen by around just 3%. This is not the type of investment investors are generally expecting significant returns from due to its modest growth.\n\nBut it could make for an appealing value buy given that it trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple (based on analyst expectations) of just 14. By comparison, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund averages a much higher forward P/E of 20.\n\nInvestors haven't been overly bullish on the stock because while it offers a steady dividend that yields 3.4%, its growth rate hasn't been all that strong. For 2025, Johnson & Johnson projects its operational sales growth to be around 3%. But if the Intra-Cellular deal goes through and results in more products contributing to its top line, that growth rate may end up accelerating in the future.\n\nShould you add Johnson & Johnson stock to your portfolio?\n\nThe deal to acquire Intra-Cellular can help diversify Johnson & Johnson's business and contribute to its long-term growth, but it likely won't turn it into a high-powered growth stock anytime soon. There are far better options to consider than Johnson & Johnson today. Even with this acquisition, its growth rate is likely going to remain in the single digits for the foreseeable future.\n\nIf, however, you're looking for dividend stock to buy, then J&J can be a good option. But with its talc lawsuits still unresolved, that's something investors should remain cognizant of as there's going to be some risk and uncertainty surrounding the business until that is over. And it's not until those legal issues come to a conclusion that I'd consider buying the stock, regardless of how cheap it may look.",

This incident has underscored the market\u2019s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nFor example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company\u2019s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines.

Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Meanwhile, the $22.5 billion edged past the consensus analyst estimate for the period.\n\nCruising down the profit-and-loss statement to the bottom line, the dynamic was rather different. On a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis, net income fell by 11% to almost $4.95 billion. However, this shook out to $2.04 per share, which bettered the average pundit projection of $2.02.\n\nIn my view, what's greatly helping Johnson & Johnson of late is a tighter business focus. For decades, it was a unique but somewhat clunky combination of classic pharmaceutical company and consumer healthcare products purveyor. That ended when it hived off the latter business as the separately managed and traded Kenvue in mid-2023.\n\nA leaner operator\n\nThese days, the slimmed-down Johnson & Johnson is doing well in the two major areas of the healthcare business in which it operates. Both of the company's reporting segments posted encouraging sales growth compared to the same quarter of 2023.\n\nInnovative medicine garnered a 4% improvement, bringing in $14.3 billion. And medtech (medical technology; essentially, healthcare devices and associated products) -- fortified with well-considered recent acquisitions Abiomed and Shockwave Medical -- rose nearly 7% to $8.2 billion. The former segment's growth was aided greatly by sales of oncology drugs, and the latter did brisk business in cardiovascular (thank you, Abiomed) and electrophysiology.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry can be quite a roller coaster in terms of profitability. Happily for its investors, Johnson & Johnson is forecasting a notable improvement in that score this year.\n\nIn that fourth quarter and full-year earnings report, it proffered guidance of $10.50 to $10.70 per share for adjusted net income for the entirety of 2025. This would represent growth of at least 5% over the year-ago figure. Sales should also rise, albeit more modestly at a projected 0.5% to 1.5%.\n\nAnother metric going in the right direction is free cash flow, which amounted to roughly $19.8 billion last year (against the slightly over $18.2 billion of 2023). Investors would be wise to keep an eye on that line item because it's the source of Johnson & Johnson's hallowed dividend. Despite the Kenvue spin-off, the company continues to habitually declare dividend raises every year -- in fact, it's one of the market's rare Dividend Kings.\n\nThese days, its annual distribution (paid quarterly) is $4.96 per share, which shakes out to a muscular dividend yield of 3.2%. That's not only impressive for the typically tight-fisted pharmaceutical sector but also compares very well to other blue chip stocks -- the average dividend yield on the S&P 500 index stands at 1.2%.\n\nI think Johnson & Johnson stock offers an appealing blend of growth potential and an extremely reliable income stream with its ever-rising dividend. It's also priced cheaply enough to be considered a bargain. This stock feels like a buy to me now.",

Appearing on 670 The Score, former Super Bowl champion and Super Bowl MVP Kurt Warner spoke about Johnson's arrival in Chicago and how he's fascinated to see how the head coach and quarterback will grow.\n\nDrawing comparisons from his time in Green Bay that did not work out for him in their system, and then finding Mike Martz with the then St. Louis Rams, Warner believes Williams getting Johnson as his head coach will have similar benefits.\n\n\"It's sitting down with Caleb and going, 'How do you see the game? What makes sense to you? What did you struggle with last year?'\" Warner said. \"Because they probably had similar plays in Detroit that they ran in Chicago but Caleb may have struggled with them. Getting an understanding of how they each see the game and them being able to try and mesh that vision point together is to me the most important thing.\"\n\nEven with Johnson's success in Detroit with a different style of quarterback in Jared Goff in comparison to Williams, Warner said it's crucial that both the quarterback and head coach share the same vision. Bringing their visions together and understanding what one another needs to be successful in the offense could unlock plenty of success for the Bears with the head coach-quarterback duo of Johnson and Williams.",

            "content": "Eric Bieniemy is now back in the NFL, but likely not at the level that anyone would have believed, especially a couple of years ago.\n\nJonathan Jones broke the news on Saturday that Bieniemy has decided to return to the league with Ben Johnson's staff as one of the assistants for the new Chicago Bears head coach. The move comes after Bieniemy earned interviews with other NFL teams, including a potential coordinator role with the New England Patriots.\n\nBieniemy is set to be Johnson's running backs coach, a return to a position he held in Kansas City for five seasons from 2013 to 2017 while mentoring and training the Chiefs' backfield\u2014including names like Jamaal Charles, Spencer Ware, Charcandrick Ward and Kareem Hunt.\n\nJohnson is a very exciting addition for Bears fans and Bieniemy should be joining a rising ship. Johnson is a celebrated offensive mind and Caleb Williams is a franchise quarterback in the making, so the chemistry could be ripe for something great in the AFC North. That said, Bieniemy's decision to take an assistant's role at this point is odd.\n\nBieniemy was the offensive coordinator for the Chiefs from 2018-2022, and he was a key part of Andy Reid's staff while claiming the team's first Super Bowl win in 50 seasons. After earning looks to be a potential head coach with interviews for half of all NFL teams, Bieniemy then took an OC role with Ron Rivera and Washington for a season in 2023.\n\nAfter that one year stint, UCLA came calling with an OC role and a chance to return to the college ranks. Again, it felt like a bit of a step back for a coach who never seemed to get a fair shake at a step up the ladder\u2014leading to speculation that maybe interview processes yielded something wrong. However, from the outside looking in, Bieniemy's case has always looked unfair.\n\nNow Bieniemy is not even stepping back into the league at the coordinator level\u2014where he left off\u2014but is instead taking an assistant's role where he was at when he first joined Reid over a decade ago. Soemtimes teams will even add \"assistant head coach\" to a coach's role to show at least some seniority but no details of that sort have emerged here.\n\nWe're glad to see Bieniemy back in the league, but the turn here is definitely unexpected. Hopefully he enjoys success with Johnson and finds a way to fulfill his coaching hopes down the road.",

However, the settlement still needs to be approved by the courts.\n\nIf accepted, plaintiffs won\u2019t be able to opt out and file individual claims instead. The company\u2019s previous attempts to settle their talcum powder lawsuits through bankruptcy using the Texas \u201ctwo-step\u201d strategy were blocked by judges.\n\nThe \"two-step\" strategy involves:\n\nJ&J creating a subsidiary called Red River Talc LLC that takes on the company's talc-related lawsuits The subsidiary filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and forcing a settlement on claimants\n\nThis method shields J&J from future talc ovarian cancer lawsuits and prevents the company from having to file for bankruptcy themselves. However, many talc powder attorneys feel the settlement offer isn't nearly enough for all those impacted.\n\nNow, two federal agencies have voiced concerns that the plan could prevent them from getting reimbursed for care provided to talc victims through government-funded programs, like Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nThere\u2019s still time to pursue talcum powder compensation. Find out more about the latest J&J settlement proposal and if our talc powder lawyers can fight for you.\n\nSee If You Qualify Now\n\nJohnson and Johnson Bankruptcy Update\n\nOver 62,000 talc-related lawsuits have been filed against Johnson & Johnson, with around 99% of these claims involving ovarian cancer.\n\nIn May 2024, J&J proposed a multibillion-dollar talc settlement for lawsuits claiming the company's baby powder and talc products caused ovarian cancer. The pharmaceutical giant gave victims 3 months to vote on this offer.\n\nJ&J has set aside more than $10 Billion for asbestos talc lawsuit payouts, which includes the:\n\n$8 Billion ovarian cancer settlement for current and future victims\n\novarian cancer settlement for current and future victims $45 Million for the family of Theresa Garcia who passed away from mesothelioma\n\nfor the family of Theresa Garcia who passed away from mesothelioma $2.12 Billion awarded to 22 women who claim asbestos talc products caused their ovarian cancer\n\nawarded to 22 women who claim asbestos talc products caused their ovarian cancer Several additional past results that were resolved outside of bankruptcy proceedings\n\nSince over 75% of plaintiffs voted to accept the proposed J&J talc settlement, the company may be able to move forward with their bid for asbestos bankruptcy trusts and wash their hands of any future talc payouts.\n\nEven with support from the majority of plaintiffs, J&J faces the challenge of securing court approval for their bankruptcy plan. The company\u2019s last offer of nearly $9 Billion to resolve 40,000 claims was rejected in 2023 for being too low.\n\nIn addition to these concerns, government agencies claim that Johnson & Johnson\u2019s bankruptcy plan is in \u201cviolation of the Bankruptcy Code and federal law\u201d because the company isn\u2019t in financial distress.\n\nNow, victims once again face uncertainty, forced to wait and see what will happen with the talc settlement money they need and deserve. A hearing in February will ultimately decide if J&J's bankruptcy plan can move forward.\n\nAsbestos in Talcum Powder: Is Talc Safe?\n\nFor decades, consumers were told talcum-based baby powder was safe for use. The mineral talc is effective in absorbing moisture, making it a popular addition to cosmetic and personal hygiene routines.\n\nHowever, talc is often contaminated with asbestos because the minerals naturally form in close proximity. Even with safe mining practices, it\u2019s often unknown whether the talc has been contaminated until much later.\n\nAny talc that contains asbestos is also considered carcinogenic, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\n\nAs some frequent talcum powder users developed serious illnesses, many families began to take legal action over this household staple.\n\nJohnson & Johnson talc lawsuits claim the powder caused various cancers, including:\n\nMesothelioma\n\nOvarian cancer\n\nLung cancer\n\nStomach cancer\n\nUterine cancer\n\nThe company has offered mesothelioma settlements in around 95% of cases involving this asbestos cancer and their talc products. Settlements for mesothelioma award $1 Million to $1.4 Million on average.\n\nWhile J&J continues to argue that talcum powder is safe, the company discontinued its talc-based powders and switched to corn starch alternatives in 2023.\n\nA Long History of J&J Dodging Accountability\n\nThe latest Johnson & Johnson talcum powder lawsuit settlements come after years of the company avoiding accountability for their dangerous products.\n\nUnfortunately, Johnson & Johnson executives knew of the potential risks linked to their talc products but hid this information from the public and halted internal safety studies.\n\nFor years, the company silently settled thousands of talc lawsuits while refusing to admit wrongdoing:\n\nOctober 2019 : The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) detected asbestos in J&J\u2019s baby powder .

Over the last five years, Johnson & Johnson grew its sales at a mediocre 5.4% compounded annual growth rate. This fell short of our benchmark for the healthcare sector, but there are still things to like about Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThe branded pharmaceutical industry relies on a high-cost, high-reward business model, driven by substantial investments in research and development to create innovative, patent-protected drugs. Successful products can generate significant revenue streams over their patent life, and the larger a roster of drugs, the stronger a moat a company enjoys. However, the business model is inherently risky, with high failure rates during clinical trials, lengthy regulatory approval processes, and intense competition from generic and biosimilar manufacturers once patents expire. These challenges, combined with scrutiny over drug pricing, create a complex operating environment. Looking ahead, the industry is positioned for tailwinds from advancements in precision medicine, increasing adoption of AI to enhance drug development efficiency, and growing global demand for treatments addressing chronic and rare diseases. However, headwinds include heightened regulatory scrutiny, pricing pressures from governments and insurers, and the looming patent cliffs for key blockbuster drugs. Patent cliffs bring about competition from generics, forcing branded pharmaceutical companies back to the drawing board to find the next big thing.\n\nIs now the time to buy Johnson & Johnson? Find out in our full research report .\n\nMultinational healthcare company Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) met Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q4 CY2024, with sales up 5.3% year on year to $22.52 billion. Its non-GAAP profit of $2.04 per share was 1.3% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nJohnson & Johnson Quarterly Revenue\n\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 5.4% over the last two years aligns with its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was consistently weak.\n\nJohnson & Johnson Year-On-Year Revenue Growth\n\nJohnson & Johnson also reports sales performance excluding currency movements, which are outside the company\u2019s control and not indicative of demand. Over the last two years, its constant currency sales averaged 4.9% year-on-year growth. Because this number aligns with its normal revenue growth, we can see Johnson & Johnson\u2019s foreign exchange rates have been steady.\n\nJohnson & Johnson Constant Currency Revenue Growth\n\nThis quarter, Johnson & Johnson grew its revenue by 5.3% year on year, and its $22.52 billion of revenue was in line with Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\n\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.2% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection is underwhelming and suggests its products and services will face some demand challenges. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nAdjusted Operating Margin\n\nAdjusted operating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It\u2019s also useful for comparing profitability across companies because it excludes non-recurring expenses, interest on debt, and taxes.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a healthcare business, boasting an average adjusted operating margin of 31.9%.\n\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s adjusted operating margin decreased by 3 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s two-year trajectory also shows it failed to get its profitability back to the peak as its margin fell by 2.8 percentage points. This performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows operating expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers.\n\nJohnson & Johnson Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (Non-GAAP)\n\nIn Q4, Johnson & Johnson generated an adjusted operating profit margin of 22.3%, down 4 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was recently less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s EPS grew at an unimpressive 2.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, lower than its 5.4% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\n\nJohnson & Johnson Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\n\nWe can take a deeper look into Johnson & Johnson\u2019s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s adjusted operating margin declined by 3 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; taxes and interest expenses can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\n\nIn Q4, Johnson & Johnson reported EPS at $2.04, down from $2.29 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print beat analysts\u2019 estimates by 1.3%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Johnson & Johnson\u2019s full-year EPS of $9.99 to grow 4.3%.\n\nKey Takeaways from Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Q4 Results\n\nIt was good to see Johnson & Johnson narrowly top analysts\u2019 constant currency revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its EPS was in line. Overall, this quarter could have been better.\n\nShould you buy the stock or not? If you\u2019re making that decision, you should consider the bigger picture of valuation, business qualities, as well as the latest earnings.

            "content": "The judge of the class action lawsuit filed against drug manufacturer Johnson & Johnson (J&J) in its capacity as an employer and plan sponsor has dismissed the two breach of fiduciary claims made against J&J due to procedural issues, namely that the Plaintiff lacked standing and failed to show actual harm in the Complaint, but stopped short of ruling on the ERISA fiduciary breach allegations.\n\nExecutive summary\n\nJ&J \u2018s dismissal was based on procedural litigation rules and stopped short of weighing in on the ERISA fiduciary breach allegations.\n\nThis does not change employers\u2019 responsibility to fulfill their fiduciary duties and they should continue the course with a proper fiduciary governance plan.\n\nA quick refresher on the case\n\nThe complaint filed in January 2024 alleged that J&J breached its fiduciary duties by not taking proper measures to ensure its plan costs were reasonable, as well as failing to exercise prudence in selecting its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) and agreeing to undesirable contract terms. Specifically, the suit accused J&J of mismanaging its employees\u2019 drug benefits, resulting in employees overpaying for premiums and paying significantly more than is reasonable for out-of-pocket costs for certain drugs. For a complete factual background, discussion of transparency trends, and methods for plan fiduciaries to minimize risk, see Lockton\u2019s previous Alert (opens a new window).\n\nThis lawsuit is an example of the recent uptick in lawsuits, such as a prominent case involving Wells Fargo, regarding compliance with recent transparency rules, reinforcing the need for ERISA fiduciary governance.\n\nAbout the ruling\n\nThe judge dismissed the two breach of fiduciary duty claims against J&J based on procedural litigation rules but stopped short of weighing in on the ERISA fiduciary breach allegations.\n\nThe court dismissed the first claim, that J&J\u2019s breach involving PBM selection and administration resulted in higher premiums paid by the former employee, based on circuit precedent that stating alleged premium increase is paid as too speculative to establish standing to maintain a case. The second claim of breach of fiduciary duty was dismissed because the plaintiff\u2019s other out-of-pocket costs created a situation where even the amount paid for the expensive drugs in question did not have a bearing on what the plaintiff ultimately paid.\n\nLockton comment: The judge determined that the Plaintiff\u2019s allegations that J&J failed to produce plan documents was sufficiently pled so that issue will proceed, and the court will determine whether J&J\u2019s written request procedures in this situation satisfied ERISA\u2019s plan document production requirements.\n\nAlthough both breach of fiduciary claims were dismissed by the court based on procedural issues, the judge did not rule that J&J, as the plan fiduciary, breached (or didn\u2019t breach) its fiduciary obligations to the plan in the administration of its prescription drug program.\n\nLockton Comment: Note, this may not be the end of this litigation, as the judge dismissed without prejudice and the plaintiffs have 30 days to file another amended complaint to address deficiencies. Additionally, a similar Wells Fargo lawsuit alleging fiduciary breaches is still ongoing.\n\nStay the fiduciary course. As stated above, there was no ruling with regard to the fiduciary breach allegations. Employers should still be working to ensure appropriate plan oversight and administration, and engaging in a prudent process when selecting and monitoring plan service providers.\n\nEmployer plan sponsors, as fiduciaries, should continue to exercise caution and care in executing their fiduciary duties to the plan. Actions steps may include:\n\nIdentify plan fiduciaries and implement fiduciary training to provide support in exercising care and compliance with fiduciary duties.\n\nConsider creating a formal fiduciary committee for health and welfare benefits, and work with legal counsel to draft a formal committee charter.\n\nReview of PBM, third-party administrator (TPA) and other service provider contracts, including review of contract terms, fees, services provided, performance guarantees, rebate structure, etc...\n\nNegotiate indemnification provisions within service providers\u2019 contracts to include protections that compensate the plan or plan sponsor for errors caused by a service provider.\n\nWork with legal counsel to properly form a health and welfare benefit committee.\n\nReview applicable insurance policies (e.g., E&O, D&O) to determine if any fiduciairy liability coverage is provided.\n\nConsider fiduciary liability insurance to protect the plan sponsor and other fiduciaries from liability for fiduciary breach.\n\nEnsure any required fidelity bonds are in place to protect the plan from losses caused by fraud or dishonesty.\n\nFor clients, Lockton has created a self-help kit called Lockton Fiduciary Governance Toolkit to help its clients ensure they are well-versed on and are meeting their fiduciary duties.\n\nNot legal advice: Nothing in this alert should be construed as legal advice.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company that started in the early 1870s. Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\n\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partner across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\n\n\nThe Zack\u2019s analyst expect NVIDIA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 50.5% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the U.S.-China tech war remain major concerns.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-0.5% vs. +1%). The company\u2019s sales in the MedTech segment have slowed down due to headwinds in Asia-Pacific markets like China and competitive pressure in some categories. The launch of Stelara generics is expected to significantly erode the drug\u2019s sales in 2025. The uncertainty around its talc lawsuits remains.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, J&J beat Q4 estimates for earnings and sales. Its Innovative Medicine unit is showing a growth trend, driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada and continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli.\n\n\n\nJ&J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and has been on an acquisition spree lately, which has strengthened its pipeline.

The company is benefiting from solid demand for postpaid services.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, the company added 6.1 million postpaid net customers while postpaid net account additions were 1.1 million, both metrics being the best in the industry. Solid growth in free cash flow accentuates efficient capital management and implies that the company is well-positioned to invest in growth initiatives and pay debt and dividends.\n\n\n\nHowever, owing to the stock\u2019s premium valuation, we believe investors should remain cautious as macroeconomic factors, market saturation, or economic downturns can significantly impact overvalued stocks like TMUS. Fierce competition is straining profitability. A high debt burden remains a concern.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on T-Mobile here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Eastern have outperformed the Zacks Security and Safety Services industry over the past year (+17% vs. +12.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $171.52 million demonstrates robust revenue growth, with net sales rising 6% year over year to $206.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, fueled by demand for truck mirror assemblies and transport packaging. Its 13% backlog growth highlights strong future sales potential. Gross margins improved to 25.2%.\n\n\n\nPortfolio realignment, including divesting Big 3 Mold, focuses resources on high-growth segments.

            "content": "The edition of Shakespeare of Samuel Johnson in Samuel Johnson in Maturity and recognition Ask the Chatbot a Question Ask the Chatbot a Question Also known as: Dr. Johnson\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTable of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nThe pension Johnson had received in 1762 had freed him from the necessity of writing for a living, but it had not released him from his obligation to complete the Shakespeare edition, for which he had taken money from subscribers. His long delay in bringing that project to fruition provoked some satiric notice from the poet Charles Churchill: He for subscribers baits his hook, And takes their cash\u2014but where\u2019s the book? The edition finally appeared in eight volumes in 1765. Johnson edited and annotated the text and wrote a preface, which is his greatest work of literary criticism. As editor and annotator he sought to establish the text, freed from later corruptions, and to explain diction that by then had become obsolete and obscure. Johnson\u2019s approach was to immerse himself in the books Shakespeare had read\u2014his extensive reading for his Dictionary eased this task\u2014and to examine the early editions as well as those of his 18th-century predecessors. His annotations are often shrewd, though his admiration reveals at times different concerns from those of some of his contemporaries and of later scholars. In his \u201cPreface\u201d Johnson addressed several critical issues. For one, he vigorously defends Shakespeare against charges of failing to adhere to the Neoclassical doctrine of the dramatic unities of time, place, and action. Johnson alertly observes that time and place are subservient to the mind: since the audience does not confound stage action with reality, it has no trouble with a shift in scene from Rome to Alexandria. Some critics had made similar points before, but Johnson\u2019s defense was decisive. He also questions the need for purity of dramatic genre. In defending Shakespearian tragicomedy against detractors, he asserts that \u201cthere is always an appeal open from criticism to nature.\u201d Echoing Hamlet, Johnson claims that Shakespeare merits praise, above all, as \u201cthe poet of nature; the poet that holds up to his readers a faithful mirror of manners and of life.\u201d He goes on to say that \u201cin the writings of other poets a character is too often an individual: in those of Shakespeare it is commonly a species\u201d and that \u201cShakespeare has no heroes; his scenes are occupied only by men.\u201d These comments inveigh against the rigid notions of decorum upheld by critics, such as Voltaire, who would not allow kings to be drunkards or senators to be buffoons. Johnson\u2019s concern for \u201cgeneral nature\u201d means that he is not much interested in accidental traits of a character, such as the \u201cRomanness\u201d of Julius Caesar or Brutus, but in traits that are common to all humanity.\n\nDr. Johnson In 1765 Johnson received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Trinity College, Dublin, and 10 years later he was awarded the Doctor of Civil Laws from the University of Oxford. He never referred to himself as Dr. Johnson, though a number of his contemporaries did, and Boswell\u2019s consistent use of the title in The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D. made it popular. The completion of the Shakespeare edition left Johnson free to write by choice, and one such choice was his secret collaboration with Robert Chambers, professor of English law at the University of Oxford from 1766 to 1773. While it is difficult to determine just how much of Chambers\u2019 lectures Johnson may have written, his help was clearly substantial, and the skilled editor was valued by the dilatory professor.\n\nPolitical pamphlets In the early 1770s Johnson wrote a series of political pamphlets supporting positions favourable to the government but in keeping with his own views. These have often appeared reactionary to posterity but are worth considering on their own terms. The False Alarm (1770) supported the resolution of the House of Commons not to readmit one of its members, the scandalous John Wilkes, who had been found guilty of libel. The pamphlet ridiculed those who thought the case precipitated a constitutional crisis. Thoughts on the Late Transactions Respecting Falkland\u2019s Islands (1771) argued against a war with Spain over who should become \u201cthe undisputed lords of tempest-beaten barrenness.\u201d This pamphlet, his most-admired and least-attacked, disputes the \u201cfeudal gabble\u201d of the earl of Chatham and the complaints of the pseudonymous political controversialist who wrote the \u201cJunius\u201d letters. The Patriot (1774) was designed to influence an upcoming election. Johnson had become disillusioned in the 1740s with those members of the political opposition who attacked the government on \u201cpatriotic\u201d grounds only to behave similarly once in power. This essay examines expressions of false patriotism and includes in that category justifications of \u201cthe ridiculous claims of American usurpation,\u201d the subject of his longest tract, Taxation No Tyranny (1775). The title summarizes his position opposing the American Continental Congress, which in 1774 had passed resolutions against taxation by England, perceived as oppression, especially since the colonies had no representation in Parliament. Johnson argues that the colonists had not been denied representation but rather had willingly left the country where they had votes, that England had expended vast sums on the colonies, and that they were rightly required to support the home country. The tract became notorious in the colonies, contributing considerably to the caricature of Johnson the arch-Tory. Yet this view is too simplistic. His rhetorical question to the colonists \u201cHow is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty from the drivers of Negroes?\u201d can be traced in large part to a principled and consistent stance against colonial oppression.",

Several Oregon Ducks are participating in this year's contest, and in practices leading up to the Saturday game, several Ducks are turning heads.\n\nFollowing a week of practice, Pro Football Focus published a story listing all of the standout Senior Bowl performers at each position, naming Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel as the top QB of the week and Tez Johnson as the top wide receiver.\n\nGabriel and Johnson were both integral to the Ducks' offensive success this season and although it was their first year playing together, they developed a cohesive chemistry early on. The pair connected 83 times over a 12-game span this year, racking up 898 yards and 10 touchdowns.\n\nMax Chadwick, the list's author says that while no QB had a \"banner week,\" Gabriel was the most \"consistent.\" Consistency from No. 8 shouldn't surprise many Ducks fans, as they saw him throw strikes all season long.\n\nWhile Gabriel may have been the best of an un-exciting bunch, Johnson made headlines all week. Each day, new clips arose of Johnson losing defensive backs with his crisp route-running, putting some silence to the concerns about his lean frame.\n\nGabriel and Johnson were one of the best QB-WR duos in college this year, but neither player is projected to be a top pick this April. Both suffer questions about size. With Gabriel, it's his height, as shorter quarterbacks have a much tougher time seeing and delivering the ball over towering linemen. With Johnson, as I mentioned, his height and weight causes concern for many. His lean frame is what makes him so shifty, but it also could make him more susceptible to injury in the NFL.\n\nBoth concerns are fair, but as they did throughout their career, Johnson and Gabriel are showing at the Reese's Senior Bowl they will be successful regardless of the competition.",

For us to be able to shine a little bit of spotlight on that \u2014 we\u2019re thrilled to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that global progress starts with women and children. We have prioritized their needs. We are convinced that when we bless a woman, we bless a family, a community and a nation.\u201d\u2014President Camille N. Johnson\n\nPresident Johnson, who has served as the Relief Society General President since 2022, has put in significant time and effort to uplift and support communities worldwide. Her leadership has been instrumental in advancing the Church\u2019s humanitarian initiatives, particularly those focused on improving the well-being of women and children.\n\nLast year, for example, the Church of Jesus Christ expanded its efforts to help women and children under 5 worldwide. The faith, which spends more than US$1 billion annually on caring for those in need, gave $55.8 million to help 2.7 million women and more than 12 million children in Bangladesh, Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Nepal, Nigeria, the Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Zambia.\n\n\u201cWe are the Relief Society, and it has been our objective since 1842 to bring relief, both temporal and spiritual, to all of God\u2019s children,\u201d said President Johnson, who in 2024 visited humanitarian projects or discussed needs in places such as Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Uganda. \u201cWe believe that global progress starts with women and children. We have prioritized their needs. We are convinced that when we bless a woman, we bless a family, a community and a nation. And when we make an investment in a child, we have invested in the future.\u201d\n\nOther initiatives President Johnson has helped spearhead include maternal and newborn care, enhancing child nutrition, supporting immunization programs, and promoting literacy. One notable project under her leadership is the maternal and newborn care initiative in the Philippines. This program has trained health workers and provided essential medical equipment, resulting in a significant decrease in maternal and infant mortality rates.\n\nIn addition to meeting global needs, President Johnson reminded people that they don\u2019t need to look far to help others.\n\n\u201cThere are malnourished children right here,\u201d President Johnson said. \u201cIt is my invitation to you to look around you. We need not travel to faraway continents to raise the sights of women and children and bless their lives. There are women in our communities who do not know how to read. There are women in this community who face barriers to receiving appropriate medical care. Identify those barriers and go out and make a difference in changing their access to medical care.\u201d\n\nOther honorees Tuesday included actress Roma Downey and Deb Haaland, the 54th Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior. Previous years\u2019 awardees have included Mary Robinson, the former President of Ireland, as well as former U.S. Secretary of Labor and Transportation Elaine Chao and Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne.",

            "content": "Could the Nets find a trade partner in the Magic for Cam Johnson?\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets have already made a couple of trades this season as they are trying to trade some of their veterans in exchange for draft picks and/or young players. However, the most notable trade candidate on their roster, forward Cam Johnson, is still in a spot where he could be moved at any point to a growing number of teams.\n\nAs of the writing of this article, Johnson has mostly been linked in reports to the Sacramento Kings, Indiana Pacers, and Memphis Grizzlies, but there is still a lot of time between now and the Feb. 6 trade deadline to see what happens with Johnson. With the reality of the new CBA setting in for many teams, especially the title contenders, it seems that if Johnson is traded, it would be to a team that is considered a darkhorse title contender.\n\nOne of those teams that could be looking to capitalize on a roster that looks to be ready to make a postseason run could be the Orlando Magic. It just so happens that the Magic are one team that could make a deal work for Johnson that may be worthwhile for both sides, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks, so let's explore what the framework of a trade between the Nets and Magic could look like.\n\nThe Mock Trade\n\nBrooklyn receives: Cole Anthony, Gary Harris, 2026 Orlando first-round pick (top-12 protected), 2028 second-round pick (more favorable of Lakers or Wizards), and 2030 first-round swap (top-10 protected).\n\nOrlando receives: Cameron Johnson and Keon Johnson.\n\nMarks' Reasoning\n\n\"In this deal, the Nets add to their collection of 31 draft picks over the next seven years and create additional financial flexibility. If Brooklyn declines Harris' $7.5 million team option, it would then have over $70 million in cap space available.\"\n\nWould This Trade Make Sense For The Nets?\n\nOn its face, this seems like a deal that would entice the Nets as they would be getting a young player in Cole Anthony who has been in and out of the rotation at certain points during this season depending on the health of the team. Prior to this season, Anthony had averaged 13.4 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game while shooting 41.8% from the field and 34.3% from three-point land in 26.5 minutes per game.\n\nGary Harris, 30, does not fit into Brooklyn's future due to his age and his declining play over the past few seasons, but as Marks points out, trading for Harris would be a way for the Nets to increase their cap space next season given that he is on an expiring deal. Also, Harris would most likely not factor much into whether Brooklyn is able to play like it did earlier in the season when they were winning too many games for the rebuild this year to be effective.\n\nThe main reason for the Nets doing this trade would be that they would be getting one first-round pick, a first-round pick swap, and a second-round pick in exchange for both Johnsons. What would be interesting for general manager Sean Marks and company to ponder is if it would be worth it to get all-in on a picks package that is essentially lottery protected, meaning that if the pick conveys to Brooklyn, they are not getting a player inside the top-10 from the Magic if their team gets drastically worse over the next two seasons.\n\nUltimately, as Brian Lewis of the New York Post reported recently, the Nets want the value of two first-round picks if they are trading Johnson so they would most likely not entertain this kind of deal, even though they would be getting an interesting young player to evaluate along with some solid draft capital. If the 2030 first-round pick swap was unprotected, I think Brooklyn would accept the offer.",

            "content": "A U.S. district judge in New Jersey has granted, in part, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s motion to dismiss a lawsuit against the company alleging mismanagement of its health plan costs.\n\nThe court ruled on Friday that the plaintiff, Ann Lewandowski, lacked Article III standing to claim that she suffered economic injury by paying higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs due to J&J\u2019s \u201cmismanagement\u201d of its health plan.\n\nIn Lewandowski v. Johnson and Johnson, filed in February 2024 in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, an employee accused the company of breaching its fiduciary duties by mismanaging its prescription-drug benefits program, thereby costing its Employee Retirement Income Security Act-covered plans and their employees millions of dollars in the form of higher payments for prescription drugs, higher premiums, higher deductibles, higher coinsurance payments and higher copays.\n\nThe J&J case was the first lawsuit to challenge the fiduciary standard for health care plan sponsors under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. The CAA requires certain service providers to issue fee disclosures to employer-sponsored group health plans in a manner akin to employer-sponsored retirement plans.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Lewandowski, represented by Fairmark Partners LLP, cited the pricing of a generic drug for multiple sclerosis, for which the plan pays substantially more than large retail pharmacies charge without insurance.\n\nInstead of using more reasonable, \u201ccost-effective\u201d options for its participants, the plaintiff argued that J&J \u201cforce[d] its benefits plans and covered employees and retirees to acquire drugs via some of the most expensive methods conceivable.\u201d\n\nJ&J was also accused of steering beneficiaries toward a mail-order pharmacy that charges higher prices than retail pharmacies for the same drug and of failing to engage in a prudent and reasoned decisionmaking process before agreeing to a pharmacy benefit manager contract that required participants to pay a higher price for drugs.\n\nU.S. District Judge Zahid Quraishi found that Lewandowski did not prove she suffered an injury by alleging that \u201charms to participants/beneficiaries have taken the form of higher premiums, higher deductibles, higher coinsurance, higher copays and lower wages or limited wage growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch an injury, at best, is speculative and hypothetical,\u201d the judge wrote in his opinion.\n\nQuraishi also found that Lewandowski\u2019s claim that she paid more in health care premiums due to J&J\u2019s alleged breach of fiduciary duty during the negotiation process for the health plans does not support Article III standing because the \u201coutcome of the suit would not affect [the plaintiff\u2019s] future benefit payments.\u201d\n\nAgain, Quraishi stated that the allegations about higher premiums are \u201cspeculative and stand on nothing more than supposition.\u201d\n\nAccording to the decision, the plaintiff alleged that she pays premiums \u201cequivalent to 102% of the combined employer and employee contributions for similarly situated individuals under the plans,\u201d without any allegation or evidence of premiums on other plans or that J&J\u2019s specific conduct resulted in higher premiums.\n\nIn addition, the court found that the plaintiff lacked standing for her claim that she suffered injury by paying higher out-of-pocket costs because the injury is \u201cnot redressable by an order from the court.\u201d Lewandowski\u2019s injury is not redressable because she reached her prescription drug cap for each year asserted in the amended complaint, according to the opinion. Essentially, Quraishi held that a favorable decision would not be able to compensate Lewandowski for the money she already paid.\n\nHowever, the court found that the Lewandowski\u2019s third count, which alleged that Johnson & Johnson failed to provide her documents after she requested them in writing, was justified. The court agreed that the company failed to respond to the request for documents within 30 days and, thus, denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss that claim.\n\nWith two counts dismissed without prejudice for lack of standing, the plaintiff will be given leave to file a second amended complaint within 30 days of the ruling.\n\nBecause the complaint\u2019s main claims were dismissed on a standing issue, Paul Holmes, a partner in Williams Barbel Morel and an attorney not involved in the case, says the claims could be resurrected by adding in, as named plaintiffs for the class, other J&J employees who have standing. Holmes says he assumes this will happen and that the case will resume where it left off.\n\nAccording to Holmes, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers might want to add some additional fiduciary breach allegations to bolster their case, as claiming outrageously high prices for certain generic drugs may not be enough.\n\n\u201cThere is little doubt that the fiduciaries of many large prescription drug plans have been swindled by the large PBMs and large consulting firms who are financially aligned,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cA pretty clear conflict of interest for both.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission recently issued a second interim report exposing the \u201copaque\u201d practices of PBMs. Lawsuits like the case against J&J have highlighted the need for plan sponsors to closely monitor the fees they are paying for their health care plans.\n\nJ&J is represented by McCarter & English LLP and Chiesa Shahinian & Giantomasi PC.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other healthcare stocks.\n\nHealthcare stocks are widely considered a cornerstone of a retirement portfolio due to their resilience, long-term growth potential, and ability to provide steady income through dividends. This sector encompasses pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, biotechnology firms, and medical device manufacturers, all of which are positioned to benefit from enduring trends like aging populations and advancements in medical technology. One of the most compelling reasons to include health stocks in a retirement portfolio is their defensive nature. Health care is a necessity, not a luxury, meaning demand for medical products and services remains steady, even during economic downturns. According to a report by Morningstar, the healthcare sector outperformed the broader market in 75% of US recessions over the past 50 years, demonstrating its ability to provide stability when other sectors falter.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nGlobal demographic trends also favor health stocks. The United Nations projects that the number of people aged 65 and older will double by 2050, reaching 1.5 billion. This aging population will drive increased demand for chronic disease management, prescription medications, and long-term care services. The US alone spends over $4.3 trillion annually on health care, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, accounting for nearly 20% of GDP. This figure is expected to rise to $6.8 trillion by 2030, driven by advances in medical technology and higher spending on aging-related health issues. Health stocks, particularly those of established pharmaceutical companies, often provide attractive dividend yields, making them ideal for income-focused retirees.\n\nDrug giants are known for consistently paying and increasing dividends. Dividends provide retirees with regular income, reducing the need to sell assets during market downturns. The healthcare sector is also at the forefront of technological innovation, offering exposure to high-growth areas such as biotechnology, precision medicine, and artificial intelligence in healthcare. Healthcare stocks provide diversification in a retirement portfolio as well, balancing out more volatile sectors like technology or energy. Additionally, healthcare ETFs like the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund offer exposure to a wide range of companies, spreading risk while capturing growth potential. For example, Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund has delivered a 10-year annualized return of 13.4%, outperforming many other sectors.",

            "content": "The public is finally learning specifics about former Brunswick-area district attorney Jackie Johnson\u2019s decisions in the wake of Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s death nearly five years ago. Arguments began in Johnson\u2019s criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nIn opening arguments, the Georgia Attorney General\u2019s office and Johnson\u2019s criminal defense lawyers presented vastly different accounts of what Johnson knew and how she acted and reacted after learning that Arbery, a young Black man from Brunswick, was chased and killed by three white men, one of whom was Johnson\u2019s longtime former employee.\n\nJohnson is on trial for violating her oath of office and hindering a police investigation. She has pleaded not guilty.\n\nTo John Fowler, deputy attorney general under AG Chris Carr, Johnson knew there was a clear conflict of interest after Arbery\u2019s death and worked behind the scenes to protect her former chief investigator, Gregory McMichael. She did so at the expense of Wanda Cooper Jones, Arbery\u2019s mother, who testified that for weeks she was incorrectly under the impression that Arbery was killed by a homeowner while committing a burglary.\n\n\u201cThis is a case about victim\u2019s rights,\u201d Fowler said. He later said, \u201cMs. Johnson put the interest of her chief investigator over a crime victim.\u201d\n\nBut Brian Steel, the Atlanta-based attorney for Johnson, said his client was deceived just like Arbery\u2019s mother \u2014 a striking new admission in the highly publicized case involving the former district attorney. The video of Arbery\u2019s killing, which Glynn County Police detectives were in possession of since the day of the murder, went viral in early May 2020 and one of the millions of first-time viewers included Johnson, according to Steel.\n\n\u201cThat is the first time she ever saw it. She says, \u2018This is a murder!\u2019\u201d Steel said, \u201cHow are they not arrested?\u201d\n\nAccording to Steel, the failures fell upon the Glynn County Police Department, as well as Waycross-area district attorney George E. Barnhill, who let McMichael, his son Travis, and neighbor William Bryan go unarrested after Arbery\u2019s killing on Feb. 23, 2020. They were not considered suspects.\n\nGlynn County Deputy Sheriff Rod Nohilly testifies about interviewing Travis McMichael on the first day of the prosecution\u2019s case. Nohilly was a Glynn County investigator when he interviewed McMichael. Jan. 29, 2025, in Glynn County Courthouse in Brunswick. Pool photo, Michael Hall/The Brunswick News\n\nOn Wednesday, Fowler proffered three witnesses, a Glynn County Police officer, Cooper Jones, and the head of Georgia Prosecuting Attorneys Council.\n\nHe is seeking to advance the theory that Johnson selected a friendly district attorney to take on the conflict-of-interest case and guide the outcome to protect McMichael.\n\nFowler said she got DA Barnhill to take the case, make a decision on the McMichaels\u2019 innocence and then stepped away from the case as prosecutor to keep her fingerprints off of it. Steel countered that the selection of Barnhill was made by Carr\u2019s office, not her.\n\nArbery\u2019s mother takes the stand\n\nJohnson violated her oath of office as a prosecutor, according to Fowler, by not advocating for crime victims like Cooper Jones. Georgia prosecutors are required by law to advocate on behalf of crime victims.\n\nCooper Jones, with short hair and a poised demeanor, testified in a third criminal case in two years about her son\u2019s death. She said nobody from Johnson\u2019s or Barnhill\u2019s offices contacted her after her son\u2019s death.\n\nWanda Cooper-Jones pauses to compose herself as she testifies about a police officer calling her to tell her son Ahmaud Arbery had been shot dead. His killers were later convicted of murder. Jan. 29, 2025, in Glynn County Courthouse in Brunswick. Pool photo, Michael Hall/The Brunswick News\n\n\u201cAt that point I was just losing hope,\u201d Cooper Jones testified. \u201cI lost my son. My whole life had just changed. I wasn\u2019t able to return back to work in the mental state I was in, and most importantly, I didn\u2019t know what happened to my baby.\u201d\n\nShe had to make calls herself to find out how her son was killed and who would be held responsible.\n\nOne of Johnson\u2019s other lawyers, Keith Adams, pointed the finger at the GCPD and its chief at the time, John Powell, who was later indicted and acquitted on separate corruption charges.\n\n\u201cGCPD from day one was perpetuating what you would find out was a lie, correct?\u201d Adams asked Cooper Jones. She confirmed it.\n\nThe 16 calls\n\nOne piece of evidence that hangs over the case, beyond complex legal theories about conflict-of-interest prosecution tactics, is the phone calls between Johnson and McMichael.\n\nThe AG\u2019s office revealed in 2022 that there were 16 calls between phone numbers for McMichael and Johnson between Arbery\u2019s death and the McMichaels\u2019 arrest. Several were unanswered or voicemails, and others were close to half an hour in length. Fowler suggested the calls represented a back-channel process to influence the criminal investigation and help her friend.\n\nThere were also calls between Johnson, her deputy prosecutors, and Barnhill.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what the AG\u2019s office plans to present about the calls during the trial or if the evidence includes the content of the calls. Fowler did not discuss the exact contents in his opening arguments nor in the first three witnesses.\n\nOn Tuesday, Steel beat Fowler to the punch and preemptively told the jurors what each of the calls between McMichael and Johnson included.\n\nThe calls were not related to influencing the outcome, Steel said. She either ignored McMichael\u2019s calls, or informed her former employee to be careful, as she thought at the time they were victims, not perpetrators, according to Steel.\n\n\u201cGet a lawyer,\u201d she allegedly told McMichael on April 30. \u201cThere are problems for you and your family.\u201d\n\nJury of teachers, retirees\n\nHow persuasive these arguments will be with the jury remains to be seen.\n\nThe Glynn County jury was selected on Monday. It consists of a preschool teacher, a supermarket manager, a pharmacist and several retirees. Ten are white, one is Asian and one is Black. Nine are women and three are men.\n\nJohnson was involved in selecting jurors, passing notes to her lawyers, and giving suggestions.\n\nArbery\u2019s mother, Cooper Jones, has been in court every day. So have Arbery\u2019s aunt and father.\n\nRelated",

            "content": "Meet Jaquan Johnson: The freshman who bullies opposing teams\n\nIn Bradley\u2019s first game against Southeast Missouri State this season, the Braves got off to a strong start, leading 15-8, when freshman point guard Jaquan Johnson checked into the game for the first time in his college career.\n\nJohnson took a few minutes to get his feet wet, but with 10:34 left in the half, he caught the ball, crossed his defender over and bullied his way into the paint for an and-one.\n\nThe bucket set the tone for the game and the guard\u2019s season, as he finished his debut with 15 points. Since that breakout game, \u201cBully,\u201d as his teammates and coaches affectionately call him, has become an integral part of Bradley\u2019s 18-3 start.\n\n\u201cThat game gave me more confidence,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe coaches gave me a lot of confidence to do what I do. I knew it would be a way bigger environment and a bigger stage, so playing that well helped me a lot.\u201d\n\nBully from the 414\n\nJohnson is called \u201cBully\u201d because he is a hard-nosed, physical and scrappy guard, who loves to get to the paint and play through contact.\n\n\u201cMy coach in ninth grade gave me the nickname after he watched me drive to the rim,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAfter that, it just stuck, and people have called me that since then.\u201d\n\nThe guard plays at 100% every time he touches the floor, and it\u2019s a mentality and playstyle he learned growing up in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the best place, but it\u2019s not the worst,\u201d Johnson said about his hometown. \u201cSince I was growing up, I [have] just been going to school, hooping and then going home. I\u2019ve made sure that I stand on my work. It can get bad, but my family always made sure I was good every day.\u201d\n\nJohnson credits his family, specifically his brother Jerome Jr., with getting him involved in basketball early on and keeping him focused.\n\n\u201cI started young,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI started in first grade but didn\u2019t begin to take it seriously until I knew I could do something with it. That was probably around fifth grade. I started to play up in eighth grade and used to go to the gym with my brother, where I\u2019d have to play against older guys all the time. It built toughness, and he used to play seriously all the time. It made me a better player skill-wise.\u201d\n\nThe Bradley coaching staff first contacted Johnson when he entered ninth grade. Johnson connected with associate head coach Jimmie Foster, who plays a significant role in recruitment for the Braves and is also from the Milwaukee area.\n\n\u201cI had a conversation with coach Foster my freshman year,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe went from there. I kept getting better, and they kept calling.\u201d\n\nMilwaukee connection\n\nJohnson is the third Bradley player to be recruited from the Milwaukee area. He joins sophomore guard Demarion Burch and senior forward Darius Hannah.\n\n\u201cWe dogs, all of us,\u201d Burch said. \u201cWe all had to get it out of the mud somehow, some way. It\u2019s a grit that we have from Milwaukee and a competitiveness that we all have.\u201d\n\nBefore coming to Bradley, Burch and Johnson were somewhat familiar with each other. Burch attended Milwaukee-Hamilton High School, and Johnson attended Pius XI High School. The two teams matched up in the summer of 2022 when Johnson was a junior and Burch was a senior.\n\n\u201cI remember that Quan was a hard worker,\u201d Burch said. \u201cHe was the leader of his team and was controlling everybody. He was talking and being a great leader. He gave me a good matchup. It was fun to play against someone like him with such high talent. Kudos to him for making it here to Bradley. It\u2019s a good school, and it\u2019s great to be his teammate now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt that time, we knew of each other, but we didn\u2019t have the connection we have now,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cI knew he was a good dude because we\u2019d talk a little bit. I knew I\u2019d have to step up and play in that matchup. He\u2019s a great player and a great defensive player. He makes my game better. He won that matchup, but it is what it is.\u201d\n\nWhy Bradley?\n\nAfter the clash with Burch, Johnson had a dominant finish to his high school career. As a junior, he averaged 27.2 points, six rebounds, six assists and was named third-team all-state. In his senior year, he became the all-time leading scorer in school history and set a school record for points in a game when he scored 49 points in the regional finals. The 5-foot-11-inch guard also added nine rebounds, seven steals and five assists.\n\nJohnson\u2019s high school career earned him offers from Grambling State, Kennesaw State, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and Bradley. Johnson chose to be a Brave because of the staff\u2019s commitment to him early in his high school career.\n\n\u201cThe coaching staff really showed that they wanted me,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI had a lot of phone calls with coach Wardle and he came to a few of my games. Coach Foster did a lot to make sure that I was able to actually come here. He came to my school to check my grades, made sure I had drills to work on to grow my game and called me after almost every game. The main reason I committed was because the effort he put in to make sure I got here was great.\u201d\n\nRising star\n\nSince arriving on campus and stepping into Carver Arena, Johnson has made an impact coming off the bench. As the season has progressed, so has Johnson, and he\u2019s begun to earn a bigger role and show why coach Wardle and the rest of the coaching staff wanted to bring him to Peoria.\n\n\u201cI thought he would be an impact freshman even though he\u2019s behind some vets,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cI thought he could come and impact us right away. He\u2019s so physical, so I knew the physicality of this game would not bother him. I got him for a few months and got a feel for his desire, work ethic and IQ. Quanny is going to keep getting better and better because he has a great IQ and a great feel. Those are the two things I usually look at.\u201d\n\nJohnson and Deen celebrate after a bucket. Photo via Bradley Athletics.\n\nJohnson has come off the bench this season behind the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) preseason player of the year, Duke Deen, who has witnessed his younger teammate\u2019s potential.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my youngin,\u201d Deen said. \u201cWhen we watched his film in the offseason I knew he was going to come in and impact right away. I just try to keep him confident. I don\u2019t try to change anything about him because he has a great game. I just try to help him when I feel like he might try to do a little bit extra when he doesn\u2019t have to. He\u2019s very receptive. He wants to learn. He wants to get better and we\u2019re always in the gym together.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy because he\u2019s not even showing his full bag,\u201d Deen added. \u201cHe has a lot more in the tank. I\u2019m not going to say anything because I don\u2019t want to get him scouted early, but I know what he can do. I feel like everyone in this program knows what he can do. It\u2019s going to be on him to keep working on it. I feel like the sky is the limit. He\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nJohnson showed how much of a problem he can be on Jan. 15 against Indiana State when he dropped a career-high 17 points and earned himself MVC freshman of the week. The rising star will need to have similar performances in order for the Braves to reach their potential this season.\n\nFortunately, Johnson is up for it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready for anything, honestly,\u201d Johnson said after his career night. \u201cPut me in, and I\u2019m going to be ready to hoop.\u201d",

            "content": "By John Hollinger, Jared Weiss and Jenna West\n\nAtlanta Hawks breakout star Jalen Johnson will miss the rest of the season after suffering a torn labrum, team sources said.\n\nJohnson suffered the injury in the second quarter of Atlanta\u2019s 122-119 loss to the Toronto Raptors last Thursday and did not return to the game. Two days later, the Hawks ruled him out indefinitely while undergoing further tests and evaluation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a potentially disastrous development for the Hawks\u2019 playoff chase. Johnson\u2019s emergence as a second scorer and playmaker who could take the load off Trae Young helped diversity Atlanta\u2019s offense, and it was almost by necessity since it came right at a moment when Young\u2019s own impact and efficiency began to wane.\n\nThis season, the Hawks have a 115.0 offensive rating with Young and Johnson on the court together, scoring at a top-10 rate. However, that swoons to 104.1 in the non-Johnson minutes, which would rank as the league\u2019s worst offense. Even in the minutes with Young but no Johnson, Atlanta\u2019s anemic 108.3 offensive rating would rank 28th in the NBA.\n\nThe evidence has been abundant in recent games, with Atlanta on a six-game losing streak that included back-to-back home loses to lowly Toronto. The Hawks are just 4-7 in the 11 games Johnson\u2019s missed this year, with five of the losses by 15 or more points.\n\nJohnson was in the midst of averaging career highs of 18.9 points, 10 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game this season.\n\nGO DEEPER With three letters, Jalen Johnson is helping to mold Hawks' new identity\n\nAtlanta is in ninth place in the East at 22-25 and sits two games ahead of 11th-place Philadelphia in the loss column. Thus, even qualifying for the Play-In Tournament is in some question with Johnson out. Moreover, the timing couldn\u2019t be worse: Atlanta owes an unprotected first-round pick to San Antonio from the Dejounte Murray trade in 2022.\n\nNews of Johnson\u2019s season-ending injury was first reported by Yahoo/TNT\u2019s Chris Haynes.\n\nWhere do the Hawks go from here?\n\nJohnson\u2019s absence is such a tough loss because Johnson has emerged as a borderline All-Star player this season and has been instrumental in getting the team back to playoff legitimacy. The timing is important because this should significantly impact Atlanta\u2019s priorities at the trade deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe team has played well enough to be buyers, but Johnson is irreplaceable in their system and they can\u2019t realistically win a playoff series against a top-three seed in the East without him. They have a lot of veterans that they could offload for picks and that seems like a much more likely course of action now that getting out of the plane is going to be a real challenge. \u2014 Jared Weiss, NBA staff writer\n\nAtlanta\u2019s options at the trade deadline\n\nThe Hawks have a protected first-round pick from the Sacramento Kings, an unprotected pick from the Los Angeles Lakers and a $23.5 million trade exception from Murray\u2019s subsequent trade to the New Orleans Pelicans. However, the Hawks are also just $1.3 million from the luxury tax line and historically haven\u2019t been willing to go over.\n\nAlso, any move has to take into account that Johnson would be back next year and in the foreseeable future as he begins the first season of a five-year, $150 million contract extension.\n\nAs a result, the Hawks might have to lean on smaller moves \u2014 such as promoting high-scoring sixth man De\u2019Andre Hunter to the starting lineup or trading away second-round picks for less expensive help on expiring contracts.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s a huge setback for a franchise that had exceeded outsiders\u2019 modest expectations for the first half of the season, including advancing to the NBA Cup semifinals. Minus Johnson, the goals likely become more modest, starting with keeping that spot in the play-in. \u2014 John Hollinger, NBA senior writer\n\nRequired reading\n\n(Photo: Jordan Godfree / Imagn Images)",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other safe stocks to buy for the long term in 2025.\n\nThe US stock market is often regarded as one of the most reliable and resilient financial markets in the world. With its deep liquidity, broad participation, and historical ability to recover from downturns, it has long been a cornerstone of wealth creation for individual and institutional investors. While it is subject to short-term volatility, its long-term performance and structural advantages make it a reliable platform for investment. It has a proven track record of delivering strong returns over the long term. The S&P 500, a benchmark index that represents the performance of 500 large-cap US companies, has averaged an annual return of approximately 10% since its inception in 1926. While short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the market\u2019s historical trajectory has been one of growth, driven by corporate innovation, economic expansion, and rising consumer demand.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nDuring major crises such as the Great Depression, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic, the market experienced sharp declines but eventually rebounded to new highs. For example, after the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, the S&P 500 recovered within six months and went on to hit record levels, underscoring its resilience. One of the key factors contributing to the reliability of the US stock market is its breadth and diversity. The market includes a wide array of industries, from technology and health care to consumer goods and energy, allowing investors to diversify their portfolios to reduce risk. Additionally, US exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are among the most liquid in the world, making it easy for investors to buy and sell shares efficiently. This liquidity and diversification provide a level of stability that is unmatched in many other markets, offering investors confidence in the market\u2019s ability to withstand shocks and recover from volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines.

            "content": "Mayor Brandon Johnson accepted scores of valuable gifts \u201con behalf of the city\u201d \u2014 including jewelry, alcohol, AirPods, designer handbags and size 14 men\u2019s shoes \u2014 and failed to report those gifts while denying internal investigators access to the room where the items are purportedly stored.\n\nThat\u2019s the bottom line of Inspector General Deborah Witzburg\u2019s latest advisory, which raises troubling questions about apparent attempts to curry favor with Johnson and his predecessor Lori Lightfoot, and the failure by both Johnson and Lightfoot to be transparent about that gift-giving.\n\nPerhaps most troubling to the inspector general was how difficult it was to secure the information, which is supposed to be promptly reported to the Chicago Board of Ethics and the city comptroller so the items can be added to \u201can inventory of the city\u2019s property .\u201d\n\nWitzburg found every mayor since Eugene Sawyer in the late 1980s has been exempt from those rules, based on an informal agreement with the Board of Ethics that has never been put into law. And her undercover investigators were denied access to the official gift log.\n\nInstead, the mayor\u2019s office directed those investigators to submit a request under the Freedom of Information Act. The FOIA request was filed without saying it was from the inspector general\u2019s office. According to Witzburg\u2019s office, there was no \u201ctimely response, constituting a denial.\u201d\n\nWitzburg\u2019s office then sent an \u201cofficial document request\u201d for the gift log. Only then was it produced in the form of a \u201cspreadsheet\u201d showing 144 gifts accepted by Lightfoot and 236 gifts received \u201con behalf of the city\u201d by Johnson between Feb. 2, 2022, and March 20, 2024.\n\nIn nearly 70% of the 380 logged gifts, the source of the gift was not identified.\n\nHugo Boss cufflinks, Givenchy handbag\n\nMany of the more valuable gifts were given to Johnson. They include: Hugo Boss cufflinks; a personalized Montblanc pen; a 2023 U.S. National Soccer Team jersey; AirPods; designer handbags by Givenchy and Kate Spade; and Carucci size 14 burgundy men\u2019s shoes. (The lowest-priced handbag listed on the Givenchy website Wednesday cost $450. The cheapest size 14 Carucci shoes were on sale for $69, marked down from $189. Montblanc pens start at $290, though personalization is included.)\n\nLightfoot\u2019s gifts included a bottle of Uncle Nearest 1856 premium aged whiskey. There\u2019s a gift listed on the spreadsheet as \u201cAlways 24k Idols Pearl and Gold Elephant\u201d without saying where it is stored. Nearly 75% of Lightfoot\u2019s 144 gifts have no storage location listed. Some are marked as located in \u201ckitchen\u201d or \u201cupstairs.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 8, Witzburg\u2019s investigators showed up to inspect the \u201cgift room,\u201d audit its contents and ensure that access to the room of valuables on the fifth floor of City Hall was controlled. But they were denied access by Chicago police officers.\n\nInvestigators were told to wait in the lobby, then informed they would be granted access to the room only by appointment.\n\nGift probe \u2018misguided,\u2019 mayor says\n\nAt an unrelated news conference Wednesday, Johnson dismissed Witzburg\u2019s \u201cso-called investigation\u201d into the gifts he received as \u201cmisguided\u201d and a \u201cmischaracterization.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want people to think, you all, that there\u2019s some room in city government where there\u2019s just a wall full of belts and socks and shoes and fancy hats,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s a log. It\u2019s there. It\u2019s been there for years. The only benefit that I get of being mayor is that I get to see the full breadth of what the greatest freakin\u2019 city in the world looks like.\u201d\n\nHe offered a random example.\n\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll go to a community function and someone will give a gift bag full of bracelets \u2026 to the city of Chicago. T-shirts,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThere are people who give items to the city because ... they want the city of Chicago to know how much they appreciate our commitment to health care.\u201d\n\nJohnson said the gifts are \u201cto the city\u201d \u2014 not to him personally \u2014 and are logged in the same way his predecessors have done for decades.\n\nAs for the \u201cgift room\u201d in the inspector general\u2019s report, Johnson said: \u201cIf people want a tour of this room, I\u2019ll sign up because I\u2019ve never been to it myself.\u201d\n\nThis photo of a guitar presented to Mayor Brandon Johnson by the Lollapalooza music festival was taken in his City Hall office in February 2024. At the time, Johnson mentioned that the guitar was his most \u201cprized possession\u201d he\u2019d received up to that point as mayor. It could not be immediately determined if the guitar was included on the gift log sent to the inspector general\u2019s office. Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times file photo\n\nStill, the episode raises questions about attempts to curry favor with Chicago mayors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine how exactly size 14 shoes would be used on behalf of the city,\u201d Witzburg told the Sun-Times. \u201cBut they\u2019re squirreled away in literally a windowless room at City Hall without any public reporting \u2014 in many cases, without any records of who the gifts are from or the circumstances under which they were received. That presents an enormous transparency and accountability problem.\n\n\u201cEver since Sawyer, the mayor\u2019s office has not followed the rules that everybody else has to follow if they are given a gift on behalf of the city. That is that they have to be publicly reported and added to an inventory of the city\u2019s property. That\u2019s a transparency and accountability measure to make sure that people are not accepting things of value and putting them to personal use.\u201d\n\nDid gift givers have business with the city?\n\nThat the Law Department advised the mayor\u2019s office to refuse to make gifts that are \u201cby definition city property\u201d available for inspection is even more \u201calarming,\u201d the inspector general said. So is the fact that the spreadsheet does not identify most sources of the gifts.\n\n\u201cWe obviously would want to know whether gifts of value were being given by people doing business with the city, people seeking city contracts, people with matters pending before the city,\u201d she said.\n\nLightfoot\u2019s spokesperson, Joanna Klonsky, said that as mayor, Lightfoot \u201ccomplied with standard gift reporting procedures as followed by\u201d decades of her predecessors \u201cwith the Ethics Board\u2019s guidance.\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office had no immediate comment on the inspector general\u2019s advisory.\n\nAld. Matt Martin (47th), Johnson\u2019s handpicked Ethics Committee chair, said Witzburg\u2019s investigators should have been allowed access to the gift room.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to give a heads-up about that. That\u2019s something that should be open and available to anyone who needs to see that \u2014 whether it\u2019s the inspector general or anyone else,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what somebody\u2019s intentions are without a really robust and publicly available log that says who gifted it and when.\u201d\n\nThe rules already in place about gifts of value appear to be adequate, Martin added \u2014 they just have to be followed.\n\n\u201cThere are times when people will drop off some sandwiches or desserts in my office \u2026 as a measure of thanks,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWe are in the habit of informing the Board of Ethics about that, but also putting that out in the public. The mayor\u2019s office should be following the rules in the exact same way.\u201d",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson ((JNJ)) has held its Q4 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s recent earnings call revealed a mixed sentiment, showcasing robust growth in sales and innovation, particularly in its Innovative Medicine and MedTech sectors. However, the company\u2019s earnings were negatively impacted by challenges such as the introduction of STELARA biosimilars and recent acquisitions, along with hurdles faced in the Chinese market and decreased margins.\n\nRobust Sales Growth in 2024\n\nJohnson & Johnson reported a strong operational sales growth of 7% for 2024, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Notably, Sprabato surpassed $1 billion in annual sales, contributing to the company\u2019s impressive portfolio of 26 platforms each generating at least $1 billion in annual revenue.\n\nStrong Performance in Innovative Medicine\n\nThe Innovative Medicine segment showed remarkable strength with sales exceeding $14 billion for the third consecutive quarter. This growth was driven by double-digit increases in key brands such as DARZALEX, CARVYKTI, and TECVAYLI, with oncology, neuroscience, and pulmonary hypertension segments performing exceptionally well.\n\nMajor Product Approvals and Pipeline Advancements\n\nIn 2024, Johnson & Johnson secured 27 major market approvals and initiated 16 Phase III studies. Significant FDA approvals included TREMFYA for ulcerative colitis and RYBREVANT for non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting the company\u2019s ongoing commitment to expanding its pipeline.\n\nSignificant Investment in R&D and M&A\n\nThe company invested approximately $50 billion in R&D and M&A activities in 2024, including a strategic acquisition agreement with Intracellular Therapies. This investment underscores Johnson & Johnson\u2019s commitment to driving strategic growth and maintaining its competitive edge.\n\nMedTech Growth and Innovation\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s MedTech sector reported over $30 billion in annual sales for the second consecutive year, with notable growth in cardiovascular and vision segments. The company launched 15 major products and acquired ShockWave, enhancing its innovation and market position.\n\nEarnings Decline in Q4 2024\n\nThe company experienced a decline in net earnings for Q4 2024, reporting $3.4 billion with a diluted EPS of $1.41, down from $1.70 a year ago. This represents an 11.1% decrease in adjusted net earnings, highlighting the financial challenges faced in this period.\n\nImpact of STELARA Biosimilars\n\nSTELARA sales declined by 13.6% due to competition from biosimilars, significantly impacting Johnson & Johnson\u2019s worldwide growth by 490 basis points, illustrating the competitive pressures in the pharmaceutical market.\n\nNegative Impacts from Acquisitions and Currency\n\nEarnings per share in Q4 2024 were negatively affected by $0.22 due to acquired IPR&D expenses related to the ZWave acquisition. Additionally, currency fluctuations posed further challenges to the company\u2019s financial performance.\n\nChallenges in China\n\nMacroeconomic pressures in China, including Volume-Based Procurement (VBP), continued to impact Johnson & Johnson\u2019s performance, reflecting the complex and challenging operating environment in this key market.\n\nDecreased Margins in Innovative Medicine and MedTech\n\nMargins in both Innovative Medicine and MedTech sectors decreased, primarily due to strategic investments and acquired IPR&D expenses, with Innovative Medicine margins falling from 37.4% to 32.5% and MedTech from 15.5% to 10.8%.\n\nForward-Looking Guidance\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, Johnson & Johnson expects an operational sales growth of 3%, despite significant headwinds such as the introduction of U.S. biosimilars for STELARA and macroeconomic pressures in China. The company projects nearly 9% growth in adjusted operational earnings per share. Key pharmaceutical assets like DARZALEX and ERLEADA, alongside new products such as CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI, are anticipated to drive sales growth. MedTech expansion is expected from recent acquisitions like ShockWave and Abiomed, with a favorable impact from acquisitions and divestitures projected to be approximately 50 basis points.\n\nIn summary, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s earnings call presented a balanced narrative of robust sales growth and innovation, countered by the challenges of biosimilar competition and strategic investments. Looking forward, the company remains optimistic about its financial outlook for 2025, supported by a diversified business model and a strong pipeline of innovation.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

Federal prosecutors said English left home in Massachusetts and traveled to Washington with the intent of killing Hegseth, whom the suspect referred to as a \"Nazi,\" and Johnson, and burning down the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank \"two blocks from the White House.\"\n\nMangione rose to national recognition late last year when he was arrested for allegedly murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Dec. 4 in Manhattan.\n\nWednesday's filing referred to English using she/her pronouns and argued why the suspect should not be released from custody. The filing cited a Jan. 27 in-custody interview with detectives. English allegedly claimed to having been diagnosed with a terminal illness, a congenital heart defect. Believing to have just four months to live, English allegedly expressed wanting \"to do something before I go.\"\n\nCOMMUTED JAN. 6 DEFENDANTS BARRED FROM DC, CAPITOL BUILDING BY FEDERAL JUDGE\n\n\"Defendant\u2019s statements during the custodial interview reflect a recklessness that demonstrates that no condition or combination of conditions would be sufficient to assure the safety of the community. For example, the Defendant told officers, \u2018That\u2019s why I feel so okay with telling everyone everything because not only am I going to be either incarcerated or incinerated within weeks or months, doesn\u2019t matter so I might as well tell you everything that I tell the lawyers because it doesn\u2019t matter and I\u2019m not afraid\u2019,\" court documents say. \"As another example, the Defendant specifically mentioned being influenced by Luigi Mangione, the individual accused in the recent murder of United Health Group CEO Brian Thompson. The Defendant referred to her call to violence as \u2018fate\u2019 or \u2018destiny.\u2019 Those statements, coupled with Defendant\u2019s statements that she has only a few months to live, demonstrate that the Defendant is a risk to the community if released.\"\n\nIn the interview, English allegedly said \"I didn\u2019t have a plan in my mind. I felt like I had to do this. I felt like I was on a mission. Maybe I told myself to have faith and just see where this goes and I had been thinking about for this for a while because of Luigi Mangione. I have seen the response to that and that situation\u2026 It was not an everyday thing and it extremely shook up everything.\"\n\nReferring to Mangione, English allegedly told detectives \"that poor kid just threw his life away for like a minute of vengeance,\" according to the interview transcript cited in the filing.\n\n\"Vengeance is bulls---, no one feels good about that,\" English allegedly continued. \"I cannot see an average, ordinary person hurting someone else and feeling good about it and I know that\u2019s extremely naive, especially how he did it. It\u2019s some guy he never met before, he shot him in the back of the head \u2013 you can\u2019t feel proud about that. He\u2019s probably questioning his humanity every single day. But as time goes on and as time went on, I started to understand things differently in my own personal situation, not regarding Luigi, regarding mainly the foremost thing is time \u2013 the feeling of running out of time, but of holy sh-- it\u2019s me\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the Messiah or anything\u2026. It\u2019s fate, it\u2019s destiny, it\u2019s whatever you want to call it.\"\n\nEnglish is charged with carrying a firearm, dangerous weapon, explosive or incendiary device on Capitol grounds and unlawful receipt or possession of a firearm.\n\nDuring a search, officers found English with a folding knife and Molotov cocktails in the suspect's jacket pockets, authorities said.\n\n\"USCP K9s swept and cleared the area, while other USCP officers and agents tracked down English\u2019s car along the 900 block of Independence Avenue, SW,\" U.S. Capitol Police statement said. \"Investigators uncovered materials to make additional Molotov cocktails inside the vehicle.\"\n\nThe suspect allegedly told investigators that English intended to kill Bessent, who was confirmed to lead the Treasury Department last week.\n\nA receipt found in English's pants pocket had a message that read: \"Judith dear god I am so sorry. You must understand I can feel myself dying slowly b/c of my heart,\" the message states. \"This is terrible but I cant do nothing while nazis kill my sisters. I love you. This is awful. Im so sorry. I love u. Please stay alive and heal. you can. you are strong enough. F--- them for pushing us so far. you dont deserve this. Im so sorry for lying and plotting and lying. Please survive.\"\n\nNANCY PELOSI SLAMS TRUMP\u2019S \u2018SHAMEFUL\u2019 PARDONS OF JAN. 6 DEFENDANTS\n\nAt some point, English stopped at a library in Chevy Chase, Maryland, where the suspect saw posts on Reddit mentioning the confirmation hearings for Bessent. The suspect allegedly changed target to focus on Bessent and purchased alcohol bottles to make the Molotov cocktails to \"throw them at Bessent's feet,\" court documents state.\n\nEnglish told authorities that the plan was to stab Bessent if the suspect was able to get close to him. While constructing the plan, English surmised that the suspect would have to kill at least three Capitol Police officers to get to Bessent.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRealizing English was unlikely to get close to Bessent, the suspect \"expressed acceptance and content with the possibility of suicide by cop.\"\n\nSince January 2024, the USCP has confiscated more than 50 weapons, outside of the congressional buildings, that were illegally on Capitol grounds, the agency said.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +1.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson & Johnson falls in, has lost 0.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.56 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.8%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.06 indicates a change of +4.7% from what Johnson & Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Johnson & Johnson is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

            "content": "Immune-mediated diseases are on the rise, with some, like psoriatic and rheumatic diseases and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), affecting more than 15 million people in the U.S. Individuals with psoriatic disease live with symptoms like painful, itchy skin plaques, while people with rheumatic disease live with inflamed, stiff joints. People with IBD live with diarrhea and severe abdominal pain. These symptoms can be debilitating and can impact many aspects of their daily lives.\n\nThe life sciences industry has been rapidly advancing the next generation of therapies that can help address the root causes of immune-mediated diseases. For almost 30 years, Johnson & Johnson has been leading the charge to deliver these treatment advances.\n\nKevin Hamill, President, U.S. Immunology, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine\n\n\u201cThe reality is that only about 10% of patients today living with immune-mediated diseases are achieving remission, or the kind of improvement they hope for,\u201d says Kevin Hamill, president, U.S. Immunology, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. \u201cThe opportunity to make a difference for more patients motivates us. Everything we do has to be transformational and set a new bar in efficacy and safety, or a better standard for tolerability. Patients expect \u2014 and deserve \u2014 more than incremental improvements in their disease.\u201d\n\nHamill is committed to leading the organization along a path that continues to harness its legacy of profoundly impacting the lives of patients, with a future focus on leading where medicine is going. STAT Brand Studio chatted with him to discuss six ways the company is ushering in a new era in immunology.\n\n1. Deepening our understanding of patients\u2019 needs. J&J actively seeks patient insights to better understand the challenges they face \u2014 both from disease and treatment perspectives \u2014 to guide the organization\u2019s research and support efforts. \u201cWe spend time really listening and understanding the needs of patients and healthcare professionals,\u201d Hamill says. \u201cIn addition, we meet regularly with advocacy groups to gather firsthand feedback that guides our efforts to make a meaningful difference. For example, we\u2019ve collaborated with the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America to create You, Me and MG, an online community aimed at building connectivity, conversation, and support around living with this rare disease.\u201d\n\nThis patient-focused approach informs everything J&J is doing, from advancing treatments for Crohn\u2019s disease or plaque psoriasis to pursuing new disease adjacencies, like innovating in atopic dermatitis.\n\n2. A tenacity for innovation. Over time, J&J has created a deep and versatile immunology portfolio that addresses a broad range of patient needs. Pursuits in autoantibody-driven diseases like myasthenia gravis, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and Sjogren\u2019s disease illustrate a purpose-driven commitment to innovate in areas of significant unmet medical need.\n\nWhen it comes to building a robust pipeline, \u201cwe identify diseases where we can apply our deep expertise and skills as a company to make the greatest impact for patients,\u201d says Hamill.\n\nThe company\u2019s strategic approach often means pursuing therapeutic advances at the nexus of unmet need, transformational innovation, and value creation \u2014 as well as leveraging the latest advancements in data and AI to help identify and understand how to get the most appropriate treatment to the right patient at the right time.\n\n3. Acting to address unmet health needs for patients. Creating treatments that are well-studied and understood across diverse patient populations is critical and begins with a focus on inclusivity. J&J recognizes the historical trend of underrepresentation in research and its implications on patient outcomes. Representative clinical studies are already fueling innovation and advances in care, guided by J&J\u2019s roadmap to achieve more equitable study programs. Steps include working with researchers and study centers that better represent the communities they serve, going deeper in underserved regions to improve access to study recruitment, and easing logistical burdens to reduce patient participation barriers.\n\nEqually important to ensuring representation in clinical research is inclusive communication around treatment options that thoughtfully blends culturally competent care with product information. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our efforts to ensure that patients who may have previously lacked access to advanced therapies see themselves represented in our outreach and education,\u201d says Hamill.\n\n4. Nurturing a culture fueled by a shared purpose. A motivated employee base that brings different perspectives and lived experiences further expands J&J\u2019s understanding of patient needs and the determination to make a difference. That often means strengthening the team with people who bring new thinking and views to the organization with a forward-looking mindset.\n\nHamill mentions four key characteristics he looks for in a new hire. First and foremost, candidates who are purpose-driven, holding patient centricity at the core of what they do. Second, people who are self-motivated, and who anticipate and seek solutions. Third, the ability to stay agile and maintain optimism in the face of challenges or change. Finally, Hamill seeks people who show grit and \u201cthe tenacity to win for patients.\u201d\n\nHamill also sees J&J\u2019s empowering culture as a differentiator that leads to better patient outcomes. \u201cIf you ask people how they feel on any given day, they will probably say they\u2019re really pleased or really proud of what they do on behalf of patients. But they\u2019re not satisfied simply based on past successes \u2014 they\u2019re future focused, and that\u2019s where our mindset needs to be,\u201d he says.\n\n5. Unleashing opportunities through strategic partnerships. As a pioneer in immunology, J&J has delivered important breakthroughs in the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. But no single organization can make such progress alone, which is why J&J actively seeks partnerships with academia, industry, the medical community, patient advocacy groups, professional societies, and others.\n\n\u201cOur collaborations have allowed us to advance targeted therapies and further support the patients we serve,\u201d Hamill states. \u201cWe are always looking to bring together our capabilities and expertise with that of external innovators, like our work underway in atopic dermatitis where we believe there is a significant opportunity to improve treatment outcomes for the nearly 17 million adults affected by this disease.\u201d\n\nJ&J\u2019s scientific capabilities and expertise in immune-mediated diseases make the company a key partner for developing and commercializing advanced therapies. According to Hamill, their focus on novel mechanisms, platforms, and technologies spanning oral and combination approaches will help maximize impact and improve the overall patient experience.\n\n6. Relentless in reimagining the future. \u201cAs a company, J&J is committed to leading where medicine is going,\u201d Hamill says. \u201cOur vision is to create a new era of innovation for patients that allows them to live free from immune disease. A lofty goal, but a necessary one that drives us daily in how we imagine the future for millions of people.\u201d\n\nThrough it all, Hamill says, J&J strives to advance novel therapies that can make the most difference for patients, deepening remission and enabling them to focus more on what matters most in their lives. \u201cWe look to drive advances in efficacy, safety, and convenience to make a profound and positive impact on the lives of all patients,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Johnson & Johnson and its affiliates 2025 01/25 cp-494534v1",

Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump\u2019s $500 Billion AI Plan. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it\u2019s different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \u201cIf you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\u201d According to him, \u201cThese were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\u201d to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \u201cNow, by the way, there\u2019s a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\u201d This means wondering where he is \u201cin terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\u201d Cramer believes that Musk \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to have them\u201d and added, \u201cIf Musk wants to be meaningful, I don\u2019t want a seat at the table, I want a table.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \u201cforget healthcare.\u201d He believes \u201cHealthcare\u2019s gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it\u2019s not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there\u2019s a call center that\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \u201cYet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there\u2019s a lot more room.\u201d Cramer believes \u201cthere\u2019s a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that\u2019s coming on.\u201d He doesn\u2019t like small-cap stocks either. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a small cap aficionado,\u201d Cramer commented. He believes, \u201cThat stuff doesn\u2019t work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\u201d The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \u201ccompanies that frankly, what we, you know we didn\u2019t think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven\u2019t done anything lately.\u201d\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\u201cThe President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That\u2019s where the President\u2019s going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 81\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a global healthcare giant. While the firm has faced a lot of turmoil in 2024, primarily because of a multi-billion dollar talcum powder lawsuit, it has nevertheless managed to grow. So far, 2025 has been an eventful year for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The firm kicked off the year by announcing a massive $14.6 billion acquisition attempt of a neuropsychiatric drug manufacturer. Then, its shares fell by 4% despite Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) beating Q4 analyst expectations for revenue and earnings. The shares fell as a 25-cent hit to projected 2025 earnings surprised investors. Here is what Cramer said:\n\n\u201cBut they [Procter & Gamble] are better than we thought. You know versus JNJ which is still having a problem with China. \u201cBecause right now it\u2019s China, until today, I have felt that if you have done a lot of business in China I just have to count you as having a bad year-over-year. And I think JNJ\u2019s being hurt by that. And I don\u2019t think JNJ\u2019s being hurt, I think it\u2019s a little unfair, I think that stock\u2019s down too much.\n\nOverall JNJ ranks 9th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JNJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company that started in the early 1870s. Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "CHAMPAIGN \u2014 The words at some point over the last two days must have been ringing in Morez Johnson Jr.'s ears.\n\nBrad Underwood took every opportunity to remind Johnson that Maryland's Julian Reese walked into the State Farm Center on Thursday and hung a comfortable 27 points and 17 rebounds on Johnson and the Illini in a blowout loss.\n\nNot all of Reese's points and rebounds were to blame on Johnson, of course, but Underwood in his endless pursuit of motivation doesn't get bogged down in those details.\n\nTime and time again, he reminded Johnson of what happened \u2013 especially Johnson's two rebounds in that game \u2013 and knew that the Illini freshman big man needed a bounce-back game with starting center Tomislav Ivisic (mono) out indefinitely.\n\n\"He probably heard that a few times, but he's one of those young people that responds to that,\" Underwood said.\n\nNeedless to say, Johnson responded resoundingly. The 6-foot-9, 255-pound Riverdale (Ill.) native had 15 points and nine rebounds in Sunday's 83-74 win over Northwestern. Johnson immediately hit floor for loose balls and had three blocks in a matchup against Big Ten leading scorer Nick Martinelli, who finished with an inefficient 17 points on 19 shot attempts.\n\nJohnson's bounce-back was fairly flawless and perfectly-timed with Ivisic in sweatpants for a second straight game.\n\n\"I was really happy because I know how competitive [Johnson] is,\" Underwood said. \"He is an incredible listener, but he was really fun to challenge. I really enjoyed the opportunity to challenge him. \u2026He's super competitive and he's got a fire that burns. It was just getting it out of him. It was great to see.\"\n\nNo. 17 Illinois (14-6, 6-4) needed every bit of Johnson's play against Northwestern and will likely need him in next week's games assuming Ivisic is out for games at Nebraska and against Ohio State.\n\nThis was neither Johnson's career high in points (20 vs. Penn State) nor rebounds (13 vs. Maryland Eastern-Shore), but his performance felt like it came at the exact right time coming after a blowout loss without a starter and a key piece of both ends of the floor in Ivisic.\n\nPlus, Underwood in his own words said Johnson didn't play very well against Maryland.\n\n\"Just making sure I get back on the glass, playing hard, make sure I'm dialed into the assignments, executing our plays, picking up the team, being a good vocal leader for everyone,\" Johnson said. \"It was a surreal moment to come in here and got a chance to start [against Maryland]. I was blessed and excited for that moment. What was different from the Maryland game was we had to make sure we played hard. I feel like they set the tone from the first few possessions. We had to make sure we set the tone this game.\"\n\nJohnson set the tone for Illinois early and often by diving on the floor on the first Northwestern possession to force a jump ball and steal a possession.\n\nThe impetus for that?\n\n\"Statement,\" Johnson said. \"That was a statement letting them know we're playing hard from the jump. It's not going to be easy to come in here and get a win.\"\n\nJohnson kicked off the game with a big dunk to start the scoring after stealing possession on the other end, he had four straight points to start the second half and he had a poster dunk over Keenan Fitzmorris.\n\nThat poster was, more or less, the exclamation point on Johnson's game. It was effortless and every bit a picture of the big, springy athlete that Illinois had been drawn to for more than three years dating back to the recruiting process.\n\n\"I knew the play before that I think I missed a layup,\" said Johnson, the No. 31 overall prospect nationally in the Class of 2024 and No. 1 in-state prospect. \"I'm like, 'Let me just dunk the ball. Just dunk the ball.' That's what I was thinking.\"\n\nAdded Illini freshman guard Kasparas Jakucionis, who assisted on the play: \"How his ball went in, I had no idea.\"\n\nUnderwood called Johnson \"absolutely fantastic\" and entered the game without planning to take Johnson out of the game unless the big man found himself in foul trouble, which had been an issue at times this season.\n\nPerhaps more impressive than his energy on the glass, big dunks and effort to dive on the floor was his job of defending Martinelli. Illinois was content with letting Martinelli shoot 3-pointers (3-of-9 shooting) and Johnson had the size and quickness to make life difficult on the Northwestern forward in the paint, where he had dominated Illinois in a 27-point performance in an overtime win in Evanston in December.\n\n\"The biggest challenge with Mo has been his over-exuberance sometimes of energy,\" Underwood said. \"Mo can really move his feet. He's 255 pounds. He jumps to touch the top of the backboard, but he's got great lateral quickness. One-on-one, I don't know if there's many guys in our gym who want to see him in front of 'em. He can really, really guard. It's always been there. It's just learning the energy, controlling it. It's what makes him really special is his ability to go do that and then he can go bang with a five man if he needs to. Then he's got a real knack that when he's guarding perimeter guys to go chase rebounds from the perimeter.\"\n\nAdded Northwestern coach Chris Collins: \"I thought Morez was great. I've seen him play since he was in ninth grade. He's a warrior. He's tough. I'm a huge fan. He's a really good player now. He's going to be a great player. He's a hard-working guy. I thought he finished well around the basket. \u2026He's a really good player and he's only going to get better.\"\n\nJohnson had been on the right end of more minutes even prior to Ivisic's illness \u2014 and Underwood is more and more playing Ivisic and Johnson together on the court \u2014 but Ivisic's absence opens the door for Johnson to get extended minutes.\n\nAfter a difficult start to that stretch against Maryland and subsequent reminders of Reese's big day, Johnson responded with a big performance against the Wildcats.\n\n\"He's amazing,\" Jakucionis said. \"You can see his energy, his defense, blocking shots, going for every rebound. It's amazing to have him on the team. It really helped us. We don't only need Tom, we need Morez too, you know? He's an amazing player.\n\n\"We need all players, but when someone cannot play we have other ones who step in and do their job very good. I'm so happy for Rez to have this opportunity to compete. He did amazing. I'm just hoping he continues doing that. When we get back Tomi we'll be even better.\"",

Some of the penalties, such as a pass interference on Marshon Lattimore and a late hit out of bounds on Mike Sainristil, kept drives alive that ended in Philadelphia touchdowns.\n\nAs for the turnovers, lost fumbles by Dyami Brown and Jeremy McNichols set up touchdowns for the home team and undercut some of the momentum the Commanders built at times in the middle of the game.\n\nIt was a disappointing afternoon for the Commanders, although it was still an incredible overall campaign for the NFC East team. After all, it advanced to the NFC Championship Game for the first time since the 1991 campaign and has an excellent young quarterback in Daniels leading the way.\n\nIf his performance in his first season was any indication, this won't be the last time Daniels has a chance to reach the Super Bowl.",

We want somebody that called plays.\u2019 Brian Schottenheimer\u2019s never been a head coach \u2014 he didn\u2019t call plays,\u201d Sharpe said.\n\nJohnson was more critical of Schottenheimer\u2019s hiring, specifically detailing what it thought it meant about Jones as an owner.\n\n\u201cObviously Jerry wants to continue his reign with power,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to relinquish that power. He wants to be in control of everything. And he hired a coach that will fall in line with just that.\u201d\n\nJohnson continued.\n\n\u201cThe definition of insanity is doing things over and over and over, in a way you see fit \u2014 and expecting different results,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe results have been the same for years, Unc. For years. And you continuously do it. Jason Garrett, Mike McCarthy, now Mr. Schottenheimer. Nothing is going to change until you remove yourself and get out the way and allow people to do their job \u2014 not you trying to do multiple things at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cChan Gailey, Dave Campo, Wade Phillips, Jason Garrett, Mike McCarthy and now Brian Schottenheimer,\u201d Sharpe said, reciting most of Dallas\u2019 head coaches since the franchise\u2019s last Super Bowl win. \u201cAll of \u2019em. Nothing changed. It\u2019s just different names. But nothing\u2019s changed.\u201d\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the poll powered by Disqus.\n\n\u201cAny of the people that you just called,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWill any of them challenge Jerry?\u201d\n\n\u201cHell no,\u201d Sharpe replied.\n\n\u201cMy point exactly.\u201d\n\nSharpe then detailed that no other NFL team showed any interest in hiring \u2014 or even interviewing \u2014 Schottenheimer.\n\n\u201cThink about it now,\u201d Johnson replied. \u201cLook at the elephant in the room. The coaches that were available, we\u2019re talking about good coaches that were also available, that could have come to Dallas, that could have interviewed in Dallas, wouldn\u2019t go for the shenanigans.\n\n\u201cYou have to get out of your own way,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cYou have to \u2014 you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Johnson and any like-minded people, Jones has given no indication that he wants to step back from his current role. Recent comments, in fact, suggest the exact opposite.\n\nUltimately, Schottenheimer\u2019s record in Dallas will be the ultimate judge of whether this was a good hire. That said, the reaction to it is quite similar to some of the previous hires that Sharpe and Johnson mentioned.\n\nThe Cowboys last won a Super Bowl in the 1995 season. That was also the last time Dallas reached the Super Bowl \u2014 or even the NFC Championship Game. With the Washington Commanders\u2019 Divisional Round win over the Detroit Lions, every other team in the conference has qualified for at least one NFC Championship Game in that time. Knowing that, a \u201cmore of the same\u201d hire can\u2019t be seen as good news for anyone who wants to see the Cowboys win.",

The five on the floor for the Tigers were freshman point guard Jada Richard, junior forward Sa'Myah Smith, sophomore center Aalyah Del Rosario and wings Kailyn Gilbert and Mjracle Sheppard.\n\nLSU OUTLASTS TEXAS A&M AT HOME Scoring struggles continue but LSU women's basketball outlasts Texas A&M at home\n\nLSU-TEXAS A&M SCOUTING REPORT LSU women's basketball-Texas A&M: Score prediction, scouting report\n\nHow did the surprising combo do?\n\nThe scoring, which the starting group has had its fair share of struggles against A&M and the last couple of games, wasn't efficient as they went 1-for-10 from the floor. Richard had the lone made field goal during that stretch.\n\nWhile the group had trouble making shots, it limited the Aggies to rough shooting as well. Texas A&M outscored LSU 9 to 3 over those four-plus minutes but 5 of those points came from the free throw line.\n\n\"We kept the lead, we went in the half up five,\" Mulkey said. \"I didn't like the last four seconds where Aalyah left her feet and we talked about that with her at halftime.\n\n\"You just keep teaching. Whoever is on that floor you just keep teaching.\"\n\nRichard converted the one made basket for her team in that stretch. Mulkey said that the reserves were going to get more minutes against A&M after LSU came off the intense loss at South Carolina two days ago. But the freshman guard talked about remaining who she is has been pivotal for her development this season.\n\n\"It's definitely a mental battle,\" Richard said. \"I stay in the gym and if you stay in the gym, you can be confident in anything you do. Fighting that mental battle of staying myself. Staying confident and whenever I get the opportunity, just try to produce in the best way I can for my team.\"\n\nTo their teammates, how the lineup performed with neither of the big 3 on the court was encouraging to see.\n\n\"I was really happy about Jada,\" Johnson said after the game. \"She's so confident in what she do, so we encourage her to shoot the ball. She's got a clip, she can shoot that thing. We believe in her to be able to make decisions even as a freshman. I'm glad she got those minutes in and she was able to do what she do.\n\n\"That's when people have to step up. I think we had some lapses but that's expected. Scoring went down a little bit but that's expected as well. But I think Jada managed the time pretty well.\"\n\nLSU STILL SEARCHES FOR SC WIN Is South Carolina 'the hump' for Kim Mulkey, LSU women's basketball? Why it isn't\n\nLSU FALLS AT SOUTH CAROLINA LSU runs out of gas in 2nd half, falls at South Carolina in competitive top-5 contest\n\nCory Diaz covers the LSU Tigers for The Daily Advertiser as part of the USA TODAY Network.

            "content": "Bossip Video\n\nSharelle Rosado, ex-fianc\u00e9e of retired NFL star Chad \u201cOchocinco\u201d Johnson, publicly addressed their breakup and rumors that the relationship was just a PR stunt. With Rosado being the star of the new Netflix reality show, W.A.G.s To Riches, Johnson made a few appearances on the series. However, the couple broke off their engagement shortly after filming wrapped.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post, Rosado revealed that one year into their engagement, she found text messages between Johnson and other women. Consequently, she ended their relationship in October 2024. She also denied rumors of a PR stunt, saying she would have a child with someone who was just a publicity stunt.\n\n\u201cIf it was just PR then we wouldn\u2019t have a child together, I mean, make it make sense,\u201d Rosado said, referring to their 2-year-old daughter, Serenity. \u201cI think some people just speculate and assume or, you know, wish their situations were di\u00ef\u00ac\u0080erent and wish they had their situation the same as ours at times. But people are going to speculate. At the end of the day, we know what we have, we know what we created. If we\u2019re together or not, we\u2019re going to support each other.\u201d\n\nThe PR stunt rumors began with Lastonia Leviston, aka \u201cStoni,\u201d who is the mother of rapper Rick Ross\u2019s first child. Leviston is also featured on W.A.G.s and was seen telling other cast members that Rosado and Johnson\u2019s relationship was not authentic.\n\nThough their relationship came to an end, Rosado and Johnson are seemingly on good terms as they co-parent. The Miami real estate guru reports that they will always support each other whether they are romantically involved or not. The former baller did play up the relationship drama when he threatened to quit Nightcap over Rosado\u2019s new Humble Baddies podcast deal with Shannon Sharpe, but Johnson admitted to trolling.\n\n\u201cI think at the end of the day, we both respect each other\u2019s role and we\u2019re still family no matter \u2014 if we get married or not. We have a child together\u2026 I still consider his kids mine. If they call me or need anything, I\u2019m there and vice versa. So we have to respect each other. We\u2019re going to always support each other [in] business and family first,\u201d she explained.\n\nNevertheless, she is not sure if they will be getting back together anytime soon.\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m focusing on myself and he\u2019s very busy. I think we\u2019re at a point of our time where it\u2019s like a lot of work is coming in and we don\u2019t honestly have time to focus on that right now,\u201d she told the NY Post. \u201cSo when the time comes, if it comes, then I guess I can answer that question.\u201d\n\nSharelle Rosado Says Taylor Swift Elevated The W.AG.s Culture\n\nIn an interview with Page Six\u2018s Virtual Reali-Tea, Rosado says that the W.A.G.s (wives and girlfriends) culture has been transformed since Taylor Swift began dating Travis Kelce. She says that because of Swift, the idea of being a W.A.G. is more appealing.\n\n\u201cI love giving Taylor Swift as an example. Ever since her and Kelce started dating, it changed the outlook of what a WAG is and it just has been becoming better and better,\u201d she said.\n\nRosado also explained that Swift\u2019s appearances at Kansas City Chiefs games puts a spotlight on those who support their football player partners.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re now starting to see more of the wives and girlfriends doing things together more, being out there more and showing that \u2026 But it\u2019s now showing the woman in the spotlight just as much as the husband\u201d Rosado stated.\n\nShe also shamelessly plugged the idea of Swift joining the W.AG.S. group and petitioned for Kelce to go to the Miami Dolphins.",

Every time a doctor talked to me, they\u2019d say it was a long-term healing process. I couldn\u2019t stand being in hospital anymore,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve got three sons and if it wasn\u2019t for them, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve gotten out of hospital.\u2019\n\nMore than 2,000 people have joined a legal case against J&J, claiming they developed a range of cancers after being exposed to asbestos contained in the company\u2019s talcum powder.\n\nMs Whytock, pictured with one of the nurses that treated her, was diagnosed with stage three ovarian cancer (Photo: Julie Whytock)\n\nKP Law, the legal firm overseeing the case, says that more than 100,000 could have been diagnosed with different forms of cancer after using the product.\n\nJ&J has denied that its talc powder contained asbestos, adding it \u2018takes the issue of talc safety incredibly seriously and always has\u2019.\n\nMs Whytock says J&J\u2019s talc powder has \u2018always been a fundamental part of the hygiene routine in my family\u2019 and that she used it with her own children as well.\n\n\u2018When I was young, I used it when I went swimming, after a bath, when I had a bit of chapping. At least once a day, I\u2019d say.\n\n\u2018My mum always used it. It feels cosy. The smell brings back lovely memories.\u2019\n\nShe has since left her job as a Quality Assurance Manager at an apprenticeship company after her diagnosis last March.\n\nMs Whytock said she is now \u2018facing up\u2019 to her diganosis and is remaining positive (Photo: Julie Whytock)\n\nMs Whytock says she is in \u2018dire straits\u2019 financially after being hospitalised (Photo: Julie Whytock)\n\n\u2018My notice from my old job was up on April 12 [last] year. I fell ill in March, so I couldn\u2019t take up my new role.\n\n\u2018Financially, I\u2019m in dire straits. It\u2019s impacting my life everywhere, but I\u2019m a positive person. You can\u2019t just give up to it. You have to put up your big girl drawers and face it.\u2019\n\nThe World Health Organisation has classified talc powder as \u2018probably carcinogenic to humans\u2019 on the basis of \u2018limited evidence for cancer in humans\u2019, including ovarian cancer.\n\nIn August 2022, J&J announced that it will stop selling its talc powder around the world after facing tens of thousands of lawsuits from women claiming asbestos in the product caused them to develop ovarian cancer.\n\nThe company discontinued sales of its talc-based baby powder in the UK in 2023.\n\nJ&J Worldwide Vice President of Litigation Erik Haas said: \u2018Kenvue, which sold the talc powder products and is responsible for any alleged associated liability that arises outside the US or Canada, spun off from Johnson & Johnson in 2023.\n\nSamaritans are here to listen, day or night, 365 days a year. You can call them for free on 116 123, email jo@samaritans.org or visit samaritans.org for more information.\n\n\u2018Johnson & Johnson takes the issue of talc safety incredibly seriously and always has. As our documents show, we have relied upon the most state-of-the-art testing protocols for decades and have been entirely transparent with government institutions and academic researchers regarding our findings.\n\n\u2018Those findings uniformly show the absence of asbestos contamination in Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder and the talc sourced for Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder. Independent science makes clear that talc is not associated with the risk of ovarian cancer nor mesothelioma.\n\n\u2018There is a group of US mass tort plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers who are actively pushing a false narrative about the history of talc and its alleged contamination to media globally.\u2019\n\nMr Haas added that \u2018the vast majority of trials in the U.S. have resulted in defense verdicts and/or appellate outcomes\u2019.\n\nJ&J has denied that its talc powder contained asbestos (Credits: Reuters)\n\nTom Longstaff, a partner at KP Law who is leading the UK case against J&J, said: \u2018All of the claimants, predominantly women but also some men, who have sustained cancer after using J&J\u2019s talcum powder products have experienced a life-changing illness. In some cases, they have died from their cancer, leaving their families devastated. All of these innocent individuals deserve justice.\u2019\n\nA Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said: \u2018We are sorry to hear of the immense suffering that Ms Whytock has endured and our thoughts are with her at this difficult time.\n\n\u2018We are clear that asbestos is a prohibited substance in cosmetics and that manufacturers must identify any unavoidable traces of asbestos in their products and demonstrate the safety of the product in an appropriate risk assessment.\u2019\n\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.\n\nArrow MORE: Drunk man gets three inch chopstick stuck behind his eye after \u2018colliding\u2019 into friend\n\nArrow MORE: Man left premature baby disabled and in constant pain after \u2018monstrous\u2019 attack\n\nArrow MORE: I ignored one symptom, then a routine test changed everything",

They opened up their pocketbook to do it, too, further killing off the dated reputation that they\u2019re cheap. It\u2019s hard to hand out an A to any hire who has never been a head coach before, though.\n\nLieser: A In a very un-Bears-like move, they targeted the consensus top candidate on the market and went all-out to get him. Their process was a little strange with so many interviews, but they landed on the guy everyone wanted them to hire.\n\nPotash: A You can\u2019t really grade a coaching hire for two or three years, but the Bears getting the most coveted coordinator available is a big step for them. Johnson is the preferred offensive-minded coach the Bears need and \u2014 most important \u2014 a coach who clearly believes in Williams.\n\nWho would\u2019ve been your next choice as head coach if they hadn\u2019t landed Johnson?\n\nFinley: Former Titans coach Mike Vrabel had the right combination of experience and attitude to steer a franchise in need of direction. He\u2019ll be successful with the Patriots, who put him in their hall of fame as a player.\n\nLieser: Commanders offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury. As it turns out, that would\u2019ve been difficult and demanded a lot of patience because Kingsbury had declined all interviews to focus on the Commanders\u2019 playoff run and wouldn\u2019t have been available even for a preliminary videoconference until this week. But the Bears\u2019 fastest path to success is to get Williams going, and Kingsbury would\u2019ve been able to do that.\n\nPotash: Without the benefit of doing personal interviews that the Bears had, it\u2019s Mike McCarthy. Pete Carroll was the best of the former head coaches available, but the Bears need a coach who can mentor and nurture Williams, and McCarthy\u2019s record of quarterback development \u2014 which is the Bears\u2019 most imperative need \u2014 is impressive.\n\nThe Bears went 5-12 this season. What\u2019s a reasonable goal for Johnson in 2025?\n\nFinley: 9-8 The Bears\u2019 road schedule features the Ravens, Eagles, Commanders, 49ers, Bengals, Raiders and three NFC North teams. No reasonable person would find more than three wins there.\n\nLieser: 11-6 There\u2019s no doubt instant improvement is expected. This is still a win-now roster, and it should\u2019ve been good enough to go at least 10-7 this season if the Bears had done better on the offensive line and had competent coaches. Seemingly anyone but Matt Eberflus could walk in here and go 10-7 next season, and if Johnson is as good as advertised, the bar should be a bit higher.\n\nPotash: 9-8 or 8-9 The NFC North still figures to be difficult next season, and the Bears will be in transition on offense and defense. A lot depends on how quickly general manager Ryan Poles and Johnson can rebuild the offensive line. It\u2019s the biggest difference between the offensive talent Johnson inherited with the Lions in 2022 (three first-round draft picks in Penei Sewell, Taylor Decker and Frank Ragnow) and with the Bears heading into the 2025 offseason.\n\nWhat do you want to see in Johnson\u2019s staff?\n\nFinley: Experience. Johnson has never been a head coach before and has only eight years of experience as an NFL position coach or higher. Dennis Allen is a good start.\n\nLieser: Cohesion. The last time the Bears hired one of the \u201coffensive guru\u201d candidates was when they brought Matt Nagy to Halas Hall in 2018. There was constant tinkering with the offensive staff and often a disconnect between what Nagy wanted and what was actually being taught by the position coaches.\n\nPotash: A defensive coordinator (Allen) and an offensive line coach with a track record of success. Those are clearly the two most important hires he\u2019ll make.\n\nWhat should be at the top of Poles\u2019 list to fix this offseason?\n\nFinley: The interior offensive line. Call it the Drew Brees Rule: Short quarterbacks need outstanding guards and a center to succeed in the pocket. The Bears will replace all three starters.\n\nLieser: The pass rush. The Bears had the fewest sacks in the NFL over the last three seasons, and they\u2019re never going to win like that. On any team, the pass rush is the most important part other than quarterback.\n\nPotash: The offensive line. Besides hiring and retaining Eberflus, Poles\u2019 misjudgment of the O-line was his most fireable offense. Right tackle Darnell Wright is the only unquestioned keeper. But with Teven Jenkins unable to stay healthy, every other spot is open for an upgrade. Left tackle Braxton Jones might be worthy of one more shot.\n\nBears quarterback Caleb Williams celebrates as he walks off the field after the Bears beat the Tenessee Titans 24-17 at Soldier Field, Sunday, Sept. 8, 2024. Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times\n\nRate Williams\u2019 rookie season.\n\nFinley: A waste. Williams is about to play for his third head coach, third play-caller and fourth offensive coordinator. If he turns into the best quarterback the Bears have ever had, it will be in spite of his rookie season, not because of it.\n\nLieser: Fine. And that\u2019s disappointing and encouraging at the same time. Everyone, including the Bears and Williams, thought he\u2019d be an instant star like Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels has been. Nonetheless, Williams showed high potential during a disastrous season without good coaching or an offensive line.\n\nPotash: Promising. Besides the elite-quarterback throws he made, Williams showed a clutch gene in late-game drives against the Commanders, Vikings, Packers and even the Lions at Ford Field. But as the fateful end of that game showed, he still needs a coach who can put him in the best position to succeed and/or teach him to put himself in the best position to succeed. That\u2019s why Johnson is here.\n\nWho was the Bears\u2019 MVP?\n\nFinley: The person who edited the curse words out of \u201cHard Knocks.\u201d\n\nLieser: Rome Odunze would\u2019ve been if the Bears had given him a better opportunity. As a rookie playing in a sputtering offense, Odunze still had 54 catches for 734 yards and three touchdowns while getting fewer targets than DJ Moore or Keenan Allen. Johnson must make Odunze the focal point of the passing attack next season.\n\nPotash: They really didn\u2019t have one. Cornerback Jaylon Johnson made the Pro Bowl. Slot cornerback Kyler Gordon could have made the Pro Bowl. Without defensive tackle Andrew Billings in the last eight games, the Bears\u2019 defense dropped from fifth to 13th in scoring, from 12th to 27th in yards and from 20th to 28th in rushing yards. Maybe Wright, who ranked fifth in the NFL among right tackles by Pro Football Focus.\n\nWho was the Bears\u2019 biggest disappointment?\n\nFinley: Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson was too busy yapping at fans to see the Commanders snap a Hail Mary, then covered the wrong person and sent the Bears into a 10-game tailspin.\n\nLieser: Running back D\u2019Andre Swift. For a few million more, the Bears could\u2019ve had Saquon Barkley. Instead, they went for Swift on a more modest contract, and he had one of his worst seasons. What once looked like a strong room of running backs now needs an upgrade in the offseason.\n\nPotash: Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron. His experience as a play-caller and success with Geno Smith with the Seahawks were why this was considered the best situation for a rookie quarterback drafted No. 1 overall. But it turned into a bad fit, and Waldron was fired after nine games.",

Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power.\n\nIn a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping.\n\nWhile the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration\u2019s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers\u2019 costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market.\n\nCan ChatGPT predict the stock market?\n\nA growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT to buy stocks.\n\nWhile most financial analysts question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a finance professor at the University of Florida, says that the chatbot may be able to predict stock movements. He used the platform to parse negative and positive headlines for stocks and predict returns for the following day. Lopez-Lira was surprised to find how good the results were.\n\nWhether or not tools like ChatGPT are effective in recommending stocks and predicting their trajectory remains a debate. However, they can be useful for investors researching the companies they want to invest in or when looking up definitions of financial terms they are unfamiliar with.",

However, this might change in 2025.\n\nJohnson & Johnson Today JNJ Johnson & Johnson $162.35 -0.64 (-0.39%) 52-Week Range $140.68 \u25bc $169.99 Dividend Yield 3.06% P/E Ratio 24.41 Price Target $171.33 Add to Watchlist\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs analysts, the potential for wider tail risks in the broader S&P 500 index is coming up, implying that increased volatility might have a tighter grip on investor and market behavior in the near future. This means there could be a systematic shift back into some of these safer \u2013 and discounted \u2013 names out there, and investors will now see how a few participants have already taken on this view inside the consumer staples sector.\n\nGet Johnson & Johnson alerts: Sign Up\n\nWith a mix of healthcare and non-cyclical products, shares of Johnson & Johnson NYSE: JNJ have now become the subject of trader attention, not just any type of trader. There is a big difference between someone buying a stock outright in a bullish view and someone deciding to buy call options on the name, meaning the direction and the move's timing are inevitable.\n\nTrade Activity Behind Johnson & Johnson Stock\u2019s Dip\n\nNow that the stock has declined to 87% of its 52-week high after a decline of up to 11.5% over the past quarter, some traders call this technical level of $146.6 a share support to be bought repeatedly, as it was back in the third quarter of 2023. With this confidence in mind, here\u2019s the trade that might tip retail investors into following suit.\n\nJust over 13,000 call options were bought for Johnson & Johnson the days following its decline to the above support level, a sign that traders are confident not only in the stock\u2019s recovery but also in the timing of this underlying move higher. Main Street should not ignore This level of conviction, as there must be a reason behind it.\n\nTo get an initial idea, investors can look to Johnson & Johnson stock\u2019s low beta of only 0.50. If Goldman Sachs is right in their 2025 macro outlook report about the tail risk in the S&P 500 index, then some capital might start to make its way into a less volatile name like this one.\n\nIn fact, some institutional buyers have already gotten ahead of the curve here. Those from Swedbank decided to boost their Johnson & Johnson stock holdings by as much as 2.1% as of January 2025, bringing their net position to a high of $326.9 million today.\n\nOr those from Robeco Institutional Asset Management, who raised the stakes by 17.3% as of the same period, netting their position at up to $235.9 million. These are signs for investors to take when building their bullish theses on Johnson & Johnson stock, but they don\u2019t stop there.\n\nThe Market\u2019s Take on Johnson & Johnson Stock\n\nWhen consulting with Wall Street analysts, the signs become clear as to why these traders \u2013 and institutional investors \u2013 decided to start buying into Johnson & Johnson stock recently. For starters, investors can look at the earnings per share (EPS) forecasts for the same quarter next year.\n\nJohnson & Johnson Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$171.33\n\n5.16% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 18 Analyst Ratings Current Price $162.93 High Forecast $215.00 Average Forecast $171.33 Low Forecast $150.00 Johnson & Johnson Stock Forecast Details\n\nThese forecasts suggest the company can achieve $2.68 in EPS for the next 12 months, a significant increase of up to 31.3% from today\u2019s $2.04. As stock prices typically are driven by underlying earnings growth, the stage is set for a potential bottom in the stock to start building for a future rally.\n\nThis is also why analysts at the Royal Bank of Canada decided to reiterate their outperform rating on Johnson & Johnson stock today, placing a valuation of up to $181 a share for the company. To prove this new view right, the stock would have to rally by as much as 23.5% from where it trades today, not to mention a new 52-week high.\n\nMore than that, if the stock takes a little more time to see the price action develop, proving the call option traders wrong, shareholders have another hidden benefit by holding onto Johnson & Johnson stock today. Given the company's low-volatility financials, management is able to maintain a $4.96 per share dividend payout.\n\nOn an annualized basis, this represents a dividend yield of up to 3.4% for investors, allowing them to outpace the current inflation rates in the United States economy.\n\nBefore you consider Johnson & Johnson, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Johnson & Johnson wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Johnson & Johnson currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

            "content": "Since the departures of Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn, the Detroit Lions are looking for their replacements. Head coach Dan Campbell hasn't ruled anything out, stating that he will consider both internal and external candidates for the position.\n\nThe offensive coordinator vacancy will not only be a highly sought-after position, but it will also be crucial in whether the Lions will be able to get over the hump next season. Johnson was able to construct the most dynamic and explosive offense in the NFL while maximizing Jared Goff's potential.\n\nTherefore, Johnson's replacement needs to be someone who can maintain that production and keep the Lions as the best offense in the league.\n\nThere are a ton of options who would be worthy hires but let's take a look at the three most likely candidates to be the next offensive coordinator in Detroit.\n\nTanner Engstrand, Lions Passing Game Coordinator\n\nThe Lions had a big win on Friday by agreeing to a new deal with offensive line coach Hank Fraley. Despite serious interest elsewhere, Fraley opted to stay in Detroit as the run game coordinator. Dan Campbell obviously values continuity and familiarity with his system.\n\nThat is why Tanner Engstrand leads the pack of worthy candidates. If Campbell decides to go with an in-house candidate, it's likely Engstrand's job to lose.\n\nEngstrand joined the Lions as an offensive assistant in 2020 and moved up the ladder to become the passing game coordinator in 2023. He played an important role in Goff's development and Johnson's dynamic offense.\n\nLike Engstrand, Johnson was also the passing game coordinator before taking over as the OC. His promotion would give the Lions the best chance at continuity running the same scheme. That potential of a smooth transition is the strongest argument in Engstrand's favor.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other best bear market stocks to invest in now.\n\nAs of January 2025, the prevailing sentiment among US economic experts leans towards cautious optimism regarding the stock market\u2019s trajectory. While concerns about potential downturns exist, explicit predictions of a bear market in 2025 are not prominent. For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.\n\nJeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nSeveral economic experts also predict a bear market in 2025. For example, Cem Karsan, a volatility trader and founder of Kai Volatility, foresees a possible stock market decline of up to 40% within the next year, per a report by MarketWatch. He emphasizes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of rate cuts and market expectations will be crucial. Karsan predicts that the 10-year Treasury yield could surpass 6% by the third quarter, which would exert additional pressure on stocks. He suggests that the Fed\u2019s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.",

Bank on the heavy favorite cashing in in Dubai this Saturday.\n\nPhoto By - Imagn Images. PFL fighter Vadim Nemkov.\n\nVadim Nemkov looks to stay sharp against veteran heavyweight Tim Johnson as the two big men collide on the undercard of this afternoon's PFL card.\n\nMMA odds have Nemkov a -2,000 favorite with Johnson a +900 underdog. Here are my best Nemkov vs. Johnson predictions and free betting picks from the Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai.\n\nNemkov vs Johnson prediction and best bet\n\nFight analysis\n\nVadim Nemkov has been fighting between the light heavyweight and heavyweight divisions in recent years, though has been inactive since submitting Bruno Cappezola in February 2023.\n\nThe inactivity has been a source of frustration for Nemkov, who has had to endure some additional setbacks with the change of opponents before Tim Johnson ended up drawing the assignment. The sambo specialist is one of the best light heavyweight champions Bellator ever had, and he now has his sights set on heavyweight glory.\n\nJohnson may be a late entry, but he is a proven veteran who has had varied success in the UFC, Bellator, and PFL. He\u2019s also a true heavyweight and will carry a significant size advantage as well as his established striking power, having won 10 of his 18 fights by knockout. He\u2019s coming off a first-round TKO loss to Denis Goltsov in August, which stopped a three-fight winning streak.\n\nAll that does for Johnson is give him a puncher\u2019s chance because Nemkov is better in every area of his game than a past-prime, middling heavyweight who is coming in on short notice. With Nemkov looking to work off some ring rust and adjust to his new heavyweight frame, this is looking like a tune-up fight in every sense of the word for one of the standout PFL fighters as he looks to become a two-division champion shortly.\n\nWhat this comes down to is that Nemkov should be able to handle Johnson with relative ease. Johnson is well past his best and never possessed the skills to exploit whatever weakness Nemkov may have. Nemkov is the pick.\n\nBest bet analysis\n\nNemkov\u2019s speed and skill set will be able to see him close the distance on Johnson and get off some big shots before Johnson can get settled in. An initial flurry will keep Johnson honest, but Nemkov will look for opportunities to take Johnson to the ground where he\u2019s been stopped in his most recent losses.\n\nUnder 1.5 rounds is also a logical option if you're looking for a better return.\n\nVadim Nemkov vs Tim Johnson odds\n\nMethod of Victory Nemkov Johnson To win outright -2000 +900 O/U 1.5 rounds +175 -250 Draw +2500 +2500\n\nOdds as of 1-25.\n\nBet on the PFL at BET99!

Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company that started in the early 1870s. Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Diversified Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other diversified dividend stocks.\n\nDiversified stocks refer to companies involved in multiple sectors, industries, or regions. These businesses, often large conglomerates like Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, generate income from a variety of operations. The main goal of diversification is to lower risk by spreading investments across various areas, reducing the potential negative impact of poor performance in any one stock or sector. Nathan Wallace, principal wealth manager at Savvy Advisors, also supported the idea of diversifying portfolio. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cThrough intelligent portfolio building and diversifying, investors can create a portfolio of risky assets with an aggregate volatility that is lower than any of the individual securities. The key here is to buy securities with attractive risk profiles that are not correlated to each other in a significant way with the goal that when one asset is performing poorly, another asset will pick up the slack through positive performance.\u201d\n\nThat said, diversification doesn\u2019t guarantee a lack of correlation between your investments. For example, owning 100 tech stocks might reduce risk compared to holding just one, but those 100 stocks are likely to be correlated with each other. To truly minimize risk, it\u2019s important to diversify beyond just one sector. According to analysts, the higher yields on Treasury bonds could provide some protection in the event of a major stock market decline. Despite this, those who believe in diversification are facing uncertainty. US stocks continue to outperform year after year, driven by the consistent profits of American companies, making other investments seem like a path to underperformance.\n\nOn the other hand, a recent study by Preqin revealed that institutions, including pensions, endowments, and foundations, hold $21 trillion in traditional diversified strategies, as of June 2024. These strategies allocate funds across various investments such as bonds, stocks, real estate, and cash.\n\nThe year 2024 proved to be exceptional for US stocks, with the broader market rising over 23%. The Nasdaq outperformed with a nearly 29% gain, while the Nasdaq 100 rose close to 25%. These impressive gains were largely driven by the Magnificent 7 stocks, which surged by nearly 67%, along with other mega-cap companies. This marked the second consecutive year that the broader market achieved gains exceeding 20%, a feat last seen in the late 1990s.\n\nRegardless of market conditions, investors have consistently sought comfort in dividend stocks. Among these, dividend growth stocks have gained significant interest. A report from BlackRock revealed that, over time, stocks that consistently increased or maintained their dividends have tended to perform better than those that didn\u2019t pay dividends or cut their payouts. In times of market decline, dividend-paying stocks often offer a safeguard against fluctuating share prices. Companies that pay dividends typically aim to sustain these payments and are usually hesitant to reduce them unless it\u2019s essential.\n\nWhen considering dividend stocks, investors typically assess the dividend yield. Experts suggest targeting yields between 3% and 6%, as yields higher than this could signal potential yield traps. Brian Bollinger, president of Simply Safe Dividends, has highlighted this advice. Below are some insights from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI generally like to advocate for an approach of targeting great businesses that might pay closer to a 3% to 4% dividend yield.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024 and selected conglomerate firms that specialize in several different businesses and pay regular dividends to shareholders. The list is ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is an American pharmaceutical company, based in New Jersey. The company specializes in a wide range of biotech and medical products and offers related services to consumers. It is gaining attention for its continued innovation and recent acquisitions. It recently revealed plans to invest more than $14 billion to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies, aiming to enhance its focus on central nervous system disorders. The acquisition will be funded through a combination of cash reserves and debt, with the deal expected to close later this year. This marks the largest biotech acquisition in over a year, indicating a rebound in healthcare mergers and acquisitions after a slowdown in 2024, as major pharmaceutical companies took time to integrate their earlier post-pandemic acquisitions.\n\nIn its recently announced Q4 2024 earnings, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported revenue of $22.5 billion, up 5.2% from the same period last year. As a healthcare company focused on disease, the company is enhancing the standard of care across a wide range of conditions with significant unmet needs, such as multiple myeloma, lung cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and heart failure. Its MedTech\u2019s global operational sales increased by 6.2%, with net acquisitions and divestitures contributing 1.5% to this growth. The primary drivers of this growth were electrophysiology products and Abiomed in the Cardiovascular sector, as well as wound closure products in General Surgery.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has raised its payouts for 62 years in a row. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.41%, as of January 22.\n\nAs of the close of Q3 2024, 81 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), up from 80 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $5.4 billion.\n\nOverall JNJ ranks 3rd on our list of the best diversified dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JNJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson and Abbott Laboratories offer substantial opportunities for investors, but one is a better buy for total returns in 2025 and 2026.\n\nThis story originally appeared on MarketBeat\n\nThe outlook and technical action suggest Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) will lead healthcare names like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) higher in 2025. While each produced a solid quarter, Abbott Laboratories outperformed and has a more robust outlook. The outlook is for Abbott\u2019s growth to be sustained above Q4\u2019s 7.2% pace in 2025, with growth accelerating YOY and margin widening. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s results will be sluggish in comparison.\n\nThe analysts' reaction to the Q4 results highlights the potential for outperformance. Abbott analysts are raising price targets and firming sentiment, while JNJ\u2019s do the opposite. The takeaway is that JNJ stock has headwinds and ABT tailwinds to increase its share price. The consensus in mid-January implies a 10% upside in 2025, while revisions suggest a move to the high-end range is likely, adding another 12.5% to the forecast.\n\nAssuming Abbott continues to perform well, the odds are high that the analyst's trends will continue to lift market sentiment as the year progresses.\n\nThe sentiment for Johnson & Johnson isn\u2019t bad, only less bullish, and a cap for the price action gives Abbott\u2019s strengths. MarketBeat.com tracks several revisions, and 100% have reduced the price target to a range below the consensus. Even so, the sentiment is firm at Hold with a Bullish bias; 45% rate the stock at Buy and 55% at Hold with no Sells. Upside potential runs in the high-single-digit to low-double-digit range this year.\n\nGrowth and Guidance are the Critical Factors in ABT and JNJ Results\n\nBoth companies reported OK quarters, and JNJ even outperformed relative to the analyst consensus. However, JNJ\u2019s results are tepid, with top-line growth of only 5.1% compared to Abbott\u2019s 7.2%, and earnings quality and guidance are also factors. Segmentally, JNJ\u2019s medtech segment was the most substantial but underperformed forecasts, while the Innovative Medicine segment outperformed.\n\nAbbott\u2019s Q4 revenue came in below consensus partly because of weakness in COVID-19 testing, but organic growth is double-digit, and all segments contributed. Coincidentally, Abbott\u2019s Medical Devices segment led with an increase of 14%, driven by a robust pipeline of products.\n\nThe bottom-line results are also good and sufficient to sustain the capital return outlook. Still, again, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Q4 outperformance is overshadowed by tepid guidance and underperformance relative to Abbott. Both forecast revenue and earnings growth this year, but Abbott\u2019s will be more substantial and more likely to outperform early 2025 estimates.\n\nIt is growing organically in all segments, and COVID-19 impacts are fading fast. The pipeline is robust, with 15 new opportunities and numerous product launches expected across product lines.\n\nJNJ\u2019s Value or Abbott\u2019s Quality; Investors Win Either Way\n\nBoth dividends are attractive but appeal to different types of inventors. Johnson & Johnson offers a high-yielding value with a dividend worth 3.4% at only 13X earnings, while Abbott\u2019s yield is lower and its valuation higher. The trade-off is the outlook for share price appreciation, which is more robust in Abbott\u2019s case.\n\nAbbott could increase in value by 10% to 20% in 2025, and the estimates are rising, while Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 10% gain is questionable. Analysts could reduce their price targets as the year progresses and keep this stock near long-term lows.\n\nThe technical action shows a bottom in JNJ stock, limiting the downside risks. Abbott\u2019s chart, on the other hand, looks strong, with price action set to break above a critical resistance point. The critical resistance is at the top of a trading range and is a significant trigger point when crossed. The market could continue on to retest the 2021 highs in that scenario and then rally to new highs later in the year or in 2026.",

Sign up now for our twice weekly newsletter.\n\nIt seems like forever ago that I first told you that Carl Proetto \u2014 the owner of the Jim\u2019s Steaks in Delco and son of the guy who owned the original Jim\u2019s Steaks location in West Philly \u2014 had filed for an emergency injunction demanding that the then-brand new Jim\u2019s West on 62nd Street in West Philadelphia drop the \u201cJim\u2019s\u201d from its name. That was in September 2023.\n\nAt first, the whole thing seemed pretty cut and dry. Proetto and his brothers sold 431 North 62nd Street \u2014 where Jim\u2019s Steaks opened way back in 1939 \u2014 to an LLC belonging to a guy named Cortez Johnson. And the deed for that transaction included a very clear clause stating that nobody could, for all eternity, operate any business at that address that included the word \u201cJim\u2019s\u201d in its name.\n\nBut at a court hearing on that emergency injunction, a second document turned up. That was a separate legal agreement between the Brothers Proetto and Johnson\u2019s company. And that agreement contained a similar clause over the name. But the clause had an important distinction. The clause stated that Johnson couldn\u2019t use the specific phrase \u201cJim\u2019s Steaks.\u201d And, as Johnson pointed out to the judge, his shop was called \u201cJim\u2019s West.\u201d Not \u201cJim\u2019s Steaks.\u201d\n\nHearing all of the evidence, the judge decided that there simply wasn\u2019t enough evidence to rule in favor of Proetto. (Emergency injunctions require the filers to meet a very high bar.) But Proetto could still move forward with a lawsuit against Johnson.\n\n\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Johnson, who had no attorney at the hearing, asked me right after the proceeding ended. \u201cYou won,\u201d I told him. And then I suggested he might want to consider getting an attorney. And that\u2019s just what he did.\n\nProetto\u2019s lawsuit against Johnson wound its way through Philadelphia\u2019s Common Pleas Court. And last week, Judge Idee Fox ruled. She issued an order against Proetto\u2019s claim that Johnson couldn\u2019t use the name Jim\u2019s in any way, shape or form.\n\nJudge Fox pointed out that \u201cJim\u2019s Steaks\u201d is not trademarked. And she wrote that while Proetto testified that his Delco shop lost business as a result of Johnson opening Jim\u2019s West, he provided no evidence of that. The judge also took note that Proetto has no issue with the Jim\u2019s Steaks on South Street, because, as he testified, it was owned by a friend of his father\u2019s. Proetto also testified that he suffered emotional distress when he saw an armed guard outside of Jim\u2019s West on the news. But Fox said no dice on that claim.\n\n\u201cAlthough this court understands Plaintiff\u2019s emotional attachment to a business started by his father,\u201d Fox wrote in her order, \u201cemotional damages cannot be recovered [in this case].\u201d\n\nFox also threw out Johnson\u2019s counterclaim against Proetto. Johnson had claimed that Proetto defamed and slandered him by allegedly lying about the nature of their agreement.\n\n\u201cI just wanna say that my lawyer Alex Palmer fought hard for this win,\u201d Johnson tells me. \u201cAnd we\u2019re pleased with the ruling from the judge. We can now move on!\u201d\n\nProetto\u2019s attorney could not be reached for comment.\n\nSo it sounds like this is the end of this particular Philadelphia cheesesteak war. But don\u2019t worry: there\u2019s usually another one just around the corner.",

The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Q : Can you discuss the growth outlook for Johnson & Johnson's multiple myeloma franchise, particularly regarding bispecifics and CAR-T therapies? A : Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, highlighted the strong performance of the multiple myeloma franchise, with DARZALEX achieving over $3 billion in quarterly sales. CARVYKTI also showed robust growth, nearing $1 billion annually. The company is expanding into community settings and exploring new combinations with bispecifics like TECVAYLI and TALVEY. John Reed, Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine, R&D, emphasized the potential of these combinations to achieve minimal residual disease negativity, a key metric for accelerated approvals.\n\nThe company anticipates a dilutive impact on adjusted EPS of approximately $0.30 to $0.35 in 2025 due to the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies.\n\nThe MedTech margin declined from 15.5% to 10.8%, primarily due to acquired IPR&D expenses related to the V-Wave acquisition.\n\nNet earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024 decreased by 11.1% compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nThe MedTech segment reported a second consecutive year of over $30 billion in sales, with strong momentum in cardiovascular and vision.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: What is Johnson & Johnson's strategy for acquisitions in the MedTech sector, particularly regarding pre-revenue companies versus established businesses? A: Joaquin Duato, Chairman and CEO, stated that external innovation is crucial for J&J's capital allocation strategy. The company completed over 40 business development transactions in 2024, focusing on smaller opportunities that complement their portfolio. Larger acquisitions like Shockwave and Intra-Cellular are considered outliers. The focus remains on smaller, strategic acquisitions to enhance their MedTech and Innovative Medicine portfolios.\n\nQ: How should we think about the sales growth trajectory for CAPLYTA following the Intra-Cellular acquisition? A: Jennifer Taubert expressed excitement about the acquisition, noting CAPLYTA's strong growth trajectory in schizophrenia and bipolar depression. The anticipated approval for major depressive disorder (MDD) is expected to be a significant growth catalyst. The company believes CAPLYTA can become a $5 billion-plus asset, with additional potential from Intra-Cellular's pipeline.\n\nQ: With STELARA facing biosimilar competition, do you expect TREMFYA to benefit from volume shifts similar to AbbVie's experience with Skyrizi? A: Jennifer Taubert noted that there is potential for patient shifts to newer therapies like TREMFYA, especially in the immunology market where patients seek better treatments. TREMFYA's recent launch in ulcerative colitis and upcoming launch in Crohn's disease are expected to drive growth. The company has invested in ensuring strong access for TREMFYA, with favorable coverage and a permanent J code.\n\nQ: What is the outlook for Johnson & Johnson's MedTech market growth in 2025, particularly for the electrophysiology business and VARIPULSE? A: Joseph Wolk, CFO, stated that the MedTech market is expected to grow 5-7%, with procedures normalizing to pre-COVID levels. Despite a temporary pause in US VARIPULSE cases, the company remains confident in its global market leadership in electrophysiology. The MedTech segment is expected to see growth driven by new product introductions and recent acquisitions like Shockwave and Abiomed.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - A day after the Wichita City Council and Sedgwick County Commission each approved $125,000 to fund testing for residents who may be affected by the contamination plume at 29th and Grove, tensions boiled over in Topeka.\n\nThe money is part of a $1 million match needed to secure $2.5 million from the state. However, residents who live in the impacted area have voiced their concerns regarding the delays in obtaining the funds which were approved by the Kansas Legislature last July.\n\nWhile the city and the county have stated they want to ensure that the proper processes are in place to provide adequate testing, the issue resulted in an altercation Wednesday night between Wichita City Councilmember Brandon Johnson and Rep. Ford Carr (D-Wichita).\n\nThe incident was caught on camera.\n\nWichita City Council members and Sedgwick County Commissioners were in the capital for the 2025 Local Government Day at the Capitol. Both Johnson and Carr, who represent those who live in the 29th and Grove area, attended a reception at The Celtic Fox in Topeka.\n\nIn the video, other leaders and lawmakers at the restaurant can be seen trying to separate the two men during a verbal argument.\n\nExpletives are exchanged and even a racial slur is used. 12 News has edited the audio.\n\nAt one point, Rep. Henry Helgerson (D-Wichita) puts himself between the two men and Carr tosses his fellow lawmaker to the side. Helgerson falls against the wall and is helped up by others in the room. He suffered an apparent head injury during the incident, according to those who were present.\n\nAccording to a police report obtained by WIBW in Topeka, officers and the Kansas Highway Patrol responded to the scene and spoke with Johnson and Carr but neither wanted to press charges.\n\nJohnson issued the following statement about the incident:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to speak about the incident in Topeka. That event will be properly investigated, and the video, and those present can speak to the specifics of what happened and by whom. I don\u2019t want that incident to in anyway distract from the genuine, positive efforts and progress we\u2019re making to for residents to address the vitally needed testing and remediation at the 29th and Grove neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nCarr said he regretted getting physical with Helgerson but didn\u2019t regret the alternation. He said that he responded to the situation \u201cwith an equal amount of aggression.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going to say that I am going to approach every situation on its merit,\u201d said Carr. \u201cHad that language had not been used against me, I would\u2019ve never come back at that language.\u201d\n\nCarr said the argument started after a discussion about funding for testing for Wichita residents in the 29th and Grove area which both he and Johnson represent. Carr said the funding on the city and county side isn\u2019t moving fast enough.\n\nCopyright 2025 KWCH. All rights reserved. To report a correction or typo, please email news@kwch.com",

The company reported 2024 fourth-quarter sales growth of 5.3 percent to $22.5 billion with operational growth of 6.7 percent and adjusted operational growth of 5.7 percent. Full-year 2024 sales growth was reported at 4.3 percent to $88.8 billion with operational growth of 5.9 percent and adjusted operational growth of 5.4 percent. Vision sales within the MedTech segment grew 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 1.5 percent for full-year 2024.Worldwide fourth-quarter sales growth of 5.3 percent was led by 10 percent growth in the U.S. Full-year 2024 worldwide growth of 4.3 percent was also led by 8.3 percent growth in the U.S.Vision sales within the company\u2019s MedTech segment grew 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, with contact lens growth of 6 percent driven by trade inventory dynamics, price actions, continued strong performance of the Acuvue Oasys 1-Day family (including the recent launch of Oasys MAX 1-Day), and lapping of prior year impacts from Russia sanctions.On the surgical side, the company noted that growth was driven by the continued strength of recent innovation (TECNIS PureSee and TECNIS Eyhance IOLs) and commercial execution, partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S.For full-year 2024, vision sales grew 1.5 percent, with contact lens sales growth of 3.6 percent, part of the MedTech segment\u2019s 4.8 percent worldwide growth to $31.9 billion.\u201cWe are encouraged by the improvements in vision, another core business. As you know, we had a slower start to 2024 but we saw that improve throughout the year, culminating in operational growth rate in the fourth quarter of 9.1 percent,\u201d Joaquin Duato, chairman and chief executive officer, Johnson & Johnson, said during yesterday\u2019s conference call.For full-year 2024, MedTech worldwide operational sales grew 6.2 percent, with net acquisitions and divestitures positively impacting growth by 1.5 percent. Innovative Medicine worldwide operational sales, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, grew 7.5 percent.\"2024 was a transformative year for Johnson & Johnson, marked by strong growth, an accelerating pipeline and industry-leading investments in innovation,\u201d said Duato. \u201cAs a health care company, with a disease-centric approach, we are improving the standard of care in a broad range of diseases with high unmet need, including multiple myeloma, lung cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and heart failure. With our strong financial foundation, differentiated portfolio and robust pipeline, we are well positioned to sustain the high pace of growth and innovation that is the hallmark of Johnson & Johnson.\u201dJohnson & Johnson said it expects 2025 sales in the range of $90.9 billion to $91.7 billion.

To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last a little over 60 minutes. With that, I will now turn the call over to Joaquin.\n\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone. 2024 was a year of progress and transformation for Johnson & Johnson. Today, we operate in a broad set of high unmet need, high growth and high innovation segments, including oncology, immunology and neuroscience in Innovative Medicine and cardiovascular, vision and robotics in MedTech. In 2024, we continue to make disciplined decisions to exit lower priority businesses while investing industry leading amount in our pipeline, approximately $50 billion in R&D and M&A in the last year, inclusive of the recently announced acquisition agreement with Intra-Cellular Therapies, which I will speak about shortly. And while we have been through a period of transformation, the fundamentals of our company remain the same.\n\nIndeed, our enduring success is rooted in two things. First, we are a purpose-driven company guided by Our Credo. And second, we are broadly diversified, meaning that we can truly lead where medicine is going. No other company has the span of expertise and capabilities that Johnson & Johnson has. No other company can impact the entire patient journey as we do. We are not just a Pharma company or a MedTech company. We are a health care company. And our strategies are disease centric focused on end-to-end solutions. Just think about multiple myeloma and the impact of DARZALEX, CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY. Think about heart recovery and the impact of Abiomed\u2019s Impella heart pumps and the promise of V-Waves minimally invasive interatrial shunt.\n\nThink about mental health and the impact of our INVEGA portfolio, SPRAVATO and the potential of the Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition we announced last week. And think about inflammatory bowel disease and the impact of STELARA and TREMFYA and the potential of our targeted oral peptide that blocks IL-23 Icotrokinra and JNJ-4804, our Co-antibody Therapeutic targeting IL-23 and TNF. As the only major health care company focused both on Pharmaceuticals and Medical Technology, we are unique in the industry with the financial muscle, global reach and this is expertise to deliver the sustained high pace of growth and innovation that is the hallmark of Johnson & Johnson. The strategic decisions we made in 2024 position Johnson & Johnson for sustained growth through the second half of the decade and beyond and strengthen our confidence in our 2025 guidance.\n\nNow to the numbers for 2024. Over the full year, we delivered robust operational sales growth of 7% excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. With SPRAVATO surpassing $1 billion in annual sales, we now have 26 platforms that generate at least $1 billion in annual revenue. In Innovative Medicine, we reported a third consecutive quarter of sales exceeding $14 billion with 10 key brands growing double-digit. Across the full year, we achieved strong growth in oncology, neuroscience and pulmonary hypertension with immunology performing well despite the entry of biosimilars for STELARA in the EU. Equally impressive is our pace of innovation, which in 2024 resulted in 27 approvals in major markets, including FDA approvals of TREMFYA for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and RYBREVANT and LAZCLUZE for first line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nIn 2024, we reported 18 positive readouts for registrational studies, initiated 16 Phase III studies and submitted 49 filings across major markets. And as you have seen over the last three weeks, we are off to a fast start in 2025. RYBREVANT and LAZCLUZE showed significant in overall survival in first line treatment of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. We received FDA approval of SPRAVATO as the first and only monotherapy for adults with treatment resistant depression. We received priority review for Nipocalimab for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis in addition to the FDA breakthrough therapy and Fast Track designations for other indications received last year. And last week, we announced a new drug application with the FDA for TAR-200, our intravesical drug releasing system for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and area of significant unmet need impacting as many as 1 million patients per year.\n\nTurning to MedTech. For the full year, we reported a second year of over $30 billion in sales with growth across most part of the business, including particularly strong momentum in cardiovascular ambition. Our pace of MedTech innovation also continues to accelerate with 15 major products launched in 2024. Major highlights of the year include the approval of our VARIPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation platform in several major markets and FDA clearance of our VELYS robotic assisted solution for the use in Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty procedures as well as an expanded FDA indication for Impella heart pumps to treat pediatric patients and FDA clearance of Shockwave\u2019s Javelin Peripheral IVL Catheter for the treatment of tight, difficult to close peripheral lesions.\n\nWe also achieved the full market release of 10 major products including the Shockwave E8 Peripheral IVL Catheter in the US. Version 8 of the CARTO 3 Electroanatomical Mapping System and our TECNIS Odyssey Intraocular Lens. And we progressed 18 clinical trial programs including the IDE approval of our OTTAVA robotic surgical system, which allows clinical trials to begin at US sites. And last year, we fortified our future by making significant value creating investments in M&A. These investments enable us to further shift our portfolio to address our mandates in high growth and high innovation markets. This included the acquisitions of Shockwave and V-Wave in MedTech and Ambrx Proteologix and the NM26 biospecific antibody in Innovative Medicine.\n\nAnd building on our nearly 70 year legacy neuroscience, we announced last week plans to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for Central Nervous System Disorders. This unique opportunity to add Intra-Cellular Therapies reflects our commitment to transforming care and advancing research in mental health. It also further solidifies sales growth above analyst expectations now and through the remainder of the decade. Together, these transactions represent industry leading levels of investment for the company, providing strategic near and long-term growth catalyst for Johnson & Johnson. Turning to 2025. And as previously guided back at the end of 2023, we expect to deliver operational sales growth of 3%, overcoming headwinds associated with US biosimilar entries for STELARA and the impact of the Part D redesign and continued macroeconomic pressures in China.\n\nPerhaps even more impressive, we are planning for adjusted operational earnings per share growth of nearly 9%. I cannot think of any other company that would be able to deliver growth through the first year of losing exclusivity of a multibillion dollar product. We are able to achieve these results because of the diversification of our business, the strength of our commercial assets as well as the breadth of our pipeline with additional launches in 2025 including TREMFYA in IBD, RYBREVANT and LAZCLUZE in lung cancer and VARIPULSE and the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Catheter in electrophysiology. In closing, I want to thank everyone at Johnson & Johnson for all that they do to help patients. We are starting the year from a position of strength and we have confidence in our sales growth and EPS guidance for 2025.\n\nAnd with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jess.\n\nJessica Moore: Thank you, Joaquin. Moving to our financial results. Unless otherwise stated, the results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore excludes the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q4 2024 sales results. Worldwide sales were $22.5 billion for the quarter. Sales increased 6.7% with growth of 10% in the US and 2.5% outside of the US. Worldwide growth was negatively impacted by 290 basis points due to STELARA and positively impacted by 100 basis points due to acquisitions and divestitures. It\u2019s important to note growth in Europe was negatively impacted by 720 basis points due to the loss of exclusivity of STELARA and the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nTurning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.4 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.41 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.70 a year ago. Excluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $4.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.04, representing decreases of 11.1% and 10.9%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Earnings per share in the quarter was negatively impacted by $0.22 of acquired IPR&D expense related to the V-Wave acquisition. For the full year 2024, sales were $88.8 billion. Sales grew 5.9% with growth of 8.3% in the US and 2.9% outside of the US. STELARA and the COVID-19 vaccine negatively impacted worldwide growth by 260 basis points.\n\nAcquisition and divestitures positively impacted worldwide growth by 50 basis points. Growth in Europe was negatively impacted by 670 basis points due to the COVID-19 vaccine and the loss of exclusivity of STELARA. Net earnings for the full year 2024 were $14.1 billion and diluted earnings per share was $5.79 versus diluted earnings per share of $5.20 a year ago. Full year 2024 adjusted net earnings were $24.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.98, representing a decrease of 4.6% and an increase of 0.6% respectively versus full year 2023. Earnings per share in the year was negatively impacted by $0.67 due to acquired IPR&D charges on various transactions throughout the year. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter.\n\nBeginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide sales of $14.3 billion increased 6.5% excluding the COVID-19 vaccine with growth of 11.1% in the US and a decline of 0.3% outside of the US. STELARA negatively impacted worldwide growth by 490 basis points. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products with 10 assets delivering double-digit growth. Results across the portfolio continue to be positively impacted by price adjustments associated with Argentina hyperinflation consistent with market practice. Starting with oncology. We continue to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. DARZALEX growth was 23.5%, primarily driven by share gains of over three points across all lines of therapy and six points in the frontline setting as well as market growth.\n\nThis marks Johnson & Johnson\u2019s first brand to achieve over $3 billion in sales in a quarter. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $334 million with growth of over 100% driven by share gains and capacity expansion. This reflects sequential growth of 17.3% aligned with our expectations of accelerating growth in the back half of the year. TECVAYLI sales were $146 million in the quarter with growth of 18%, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed refractory setting. Demand remains strong despite continued adoption of longer duration dosing intervals. Finally, within our multiple myeloma portfolio, TALVEY continued its launch trajectory with another quarter of strong growth. As a reminder, we anticipate disclosing TALVEY sales in the first quarter of 2025, which are currently reported in the category Other Oncology.\n\nERLEADA continues to deliver strong growth of 22.7%, primarily driven by share gains and market growth, reaching $3 billion in annual sales for the first time. RYBREVANT, our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer, contributed to growth in the category Other Oncology as we continue to expand approved indications. We also anticipate disclosing RYBREVANT sales in the first quarter of 2025. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in TREMFYA of 5.6%, driven by strong market growth and share gains in PsO and PsA, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and inventory dynamics. We are excited about the recent UC launch and expect to see strong uptake of the IBD indications in 2025. STELARA declined 13.6% driven by the impact of current and anticipated biosimilar competition.\n\nAs a reminder, biosimilar competition has entered the US in January 2025. REMICADE and SIMPONI worldwide sales were positively impacted by return of distribution rights in Europe. In Neuroscience, SPRAVATO growth of 45.3% continues to be driven by increased physician and patient demand. As Joaquin mentioned, SPRAVATO has exceeded $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. Other Neuroscience decline was driven by the loss of a SPINRAZA tender in Europe. In Pulmonary Hypertension, OPSUMIT grew 2.5%, driven by market growth and share gains, partially offset by inventory dynamics in the US and austerity measures in Europe. Starting in 2025, we will begin to report OPSYNVI, which is currently reported in the category Other Pulmonary Hypertension in OPSUMIT.\n\nUPTRAVI grew 12. 1%, driven by market growth, patient mix and share gains. Finally, XARELTO sales growth was driven by favorable patient mix. I\u2019ll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide sales of $8.2 billion increased 7.6% both in the US and outside of the US. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 300 basis points on worldwide growth, 430 basis points in the US and 150 basis points outside of the US. Overall, MedTech growth was driven by commercial execution and strength of new product introductions, partially offset by increased competitive PFA pressures in US electrophysiology and continued headwinds in Asia Pacific, primarily in China. In Cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered growth of 7.3%. Performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake and commercial execution, partially offset by competitive PFA ablation catheter uptake in the US and VBP in China.\n\nDespite the IV saline shortage in the US, Abiomed delivered growth of 13.2% driven by strong growth in all regions and continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. Cardiovascular results also included $258 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave. Contact Lenses and Other grew 7.4%, driven by trade inventory dynamics, continued strategic price actions, strong performance in ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products as well as lapping prior year impacts from Russia sanctions. Surgical Vision growth of 13.6% was driven by TECNIS PureSee & TECNIS Eyhance. Commercial execution partially offset by competitive pressures in the US. Orthopedics grew 2.5% inclusive of hips growth of 5.6%, primarily driven by the success of recent product launches and commercial execution, partially offset by revenue disruption from the previously announced orthopedics transformation, impacts of China VBP and competitive pressures.\n\nLastly, Surgery grew 0.4% with the Acclarent divestiture negatively impacting results by approximately 130 basis points. Performance was driven primarily by commercial execution, strength of new products across wound closure and biosurgery and continued price adjustments primarily associated with hyperinflation consistent with market practice. Growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in Energy and Endocutters as well as VBP and the anticorruption campaign in China. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024. I\u2019d like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels to fortify our future, investing $5.3 billion or nearly 24% of sales, which includes $540 million of acquired IPR&D expense associated with the V-Wave acquisition.\n\nSelling, marketing and administrative expense as a percent of sales deleveraged 150 basis points driven by increased commercial investment in the Innovative Medicine business. Interest income and expense was a net income of $144 million as compared to $212 million of income last year driven by lower interest rates earned on a lower average cash balance and higher interest rates on a higher average debt balance. Other income and expense was a net income of $161 million compared to $421 million of income in the prior year. This was primarily driven by lower gains on securities, a lower benefit related to employee benefit programs due to the discount rate, partially offset by lower litigation expense in 2024. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 11.7% versus 14.4% in the same period last year.\n\nThis decrease was primarily driven by post-acquisition integration efforts that allowed the company to deduct certain acquisition costs for tax purposes as well as the resolution of prior tax matters both in jurisdictions outside of the US. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 8.8% versus 10.8% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2024 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax related matters. Lastly, I\u2019ll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible, amortization expense and special items. Now let\u2019s look at adjusted income before tax by segment for the quarter.\n\nInnovative Medicine margin declined from 37.4% to 32.5% primarily driven by strategic commercial investment and R&D pipeline advancement. MedTech margin declined from 15.5% to 10. 8% primarily driven by acquired IPR&D expense related to the V-Wave acquisition. Please note that the MedTech margin was negatively impacted in both years due to expenses associated with the strategic acquisition of Laminar. When adjusting for these one-time items, MedTech margin was relatively flat. As a result, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 29.2% to 24.1% with the V-Wave acquired IPR&D expense impacting results by 240 basis points. When looking at the full year, Innovative Medicine, MedTech and the Enterprise adjusted income before tax remained relatively flat year-over-year when adjusting for the one-time items highlighted on the slide, mainly acquired IPR&D expenses on various transactions across both years.\n\nThis concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I am now pleased to turn it over to Joe.\n\nJoseph Wolk: Thank you, Jessica, and thanks everyone for joining us today. As you\u2019ve heard already, we delivered solid overall fourth quarter and full year results in 2024, above the operational guidance we set at the beginning of the year when excluding acquisition costs we incurred to fortify our business for the future. We are particularly pleased with advancements made throughout the year, strengthening our pipeline, achieving key milestones across core therapeutic areas and platforms. We continue to prioritize investment and innovation, forge strategic partnerships that further enhance our differentiated business and focus on improving margins positioning the company for near and long-term growth. Additionally, we\u2019ve made progress toward resolving the talc litigation.\n\nAs many of you are aware, our prepackaged bankruptcy plan received overwhelming support from current claimants and the futures claims representative and that support has only increased in recent months. The next milestone is the scheduled confirmation hearing commencing on February 18th in the Southern District of Texas Bankruptcy Court. Now let\u2019s get into the numbers, starting with cash and capital allocation. We ended 2024 with approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $37 billion of debt for a net debt position of approximately $12 billion. Our focus on cash flow resulted in the company delivering approximately $20 billion of free cash flow during 2024, $1.6 billion more than in 2023, despite having higher litigation settlement payments during 2024, higher TCJA toll tax and eight months of contribution from Consumer Health in 2023.\n\nOur ability to strategically invest and deploy capital that unlocks value has made Johnson & Johnson successful in the past and will be as important for our success moving forward. We evaluate strong credit rating, which underscores the strength of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s financial discipline and enables us to execute against our capital allocation priorities. In Research and Development, we invested more than $17 billion or 19.4% of sales. We remain one of the top investors in R&D across all industries. 2024 marked the 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases. We know this use of capital is a priority for our investors and we plan to continue to increase our dividend annually. We also deployed, announced or committed to over $32 billion in strategic value-creating inorganic growth opportunities in the last 12 months.\n\nThis amount includes larger transactions such as Shockwave, Proteologix, the NM26 bispecific antibody, V-Wave, the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies as well as more than 40 smaller early-stage collaborations and partnerships to complement our businesses that are much more common for us than larger transactions. As we look ahead to 2025, we will maintain a heightened focus on cash flow generation to build on our strong financial foundation and judiciously deploy capital on behalf of shareholders to create value. Let\u2019s now discuss our full year guidance for 2025. It is important to note that guidance at this time excludes the impact from the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, but I will provide some comments on that transaction in a few moments.\n\nWe anticipate operational sales in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% with a midpoint of $91.3 billion or 3.0% in line with the expectations outlined at our late 2023 enterprise business review as Joaquin noted. Acquisitions and divestitures are expected to favorably impact operational growth by approximately 50 basis points resulting in an adjusted operational sales growth midpoint of 2.5%. Sales growth across our innovative medicine businesses will be driven by our proven assets such as DARZALEX, ERLEADA and SPRAVATO. Our recently launched products, CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY and our new launches of TREMFYA in IBD and RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE in lung cancer. The strength of our portfolio enables Innovative Medicine to grow despite the expanded STELARA biosimilar competition and approximately $2 billion negative impact from Part D redesign.\n\nMedTech sales growth will be driven by our recent acquisitions, Shockwave and Abiomed as well as continued uptake of our recently launched products such as VARIPULSE, TECNIS Odyssey, ACUVUE OASYS MAX, the VELYS portfolio of enabling technology and our barbed suture and hemostat portfolio. We continue to expect China to remain a headwind through 2025. Regarding VARIPULSE in the US, we are working diligently to complete our investigation and we\u2019ll provide an update when we have additional information to share. As a reminder, there is no impact to commercial activity to VARIPULSE outside of the United States. As you know, we don\u2019t speculate on future currency movements. For today\u2019s call, we are utilizing yesterday\u2019s euro spot rate relative to the US dollar of 1.04 significantly below last quarter\u2019s euro spot rate of $1.10.\n\nThis results in an estimated unfavorable foreign currency impact on sales of $1.7 billion or 2.0%, as such, we estimate reported 2025 sales of $89.6 billion or 1% growth at the midpoint. Turning to other items on the P&L. Despite STELARA biosimilar competition and the impact of Part D redesign, we expect our 2025 adjusted pre-tax operating margins to increase by approximately 300 basis points of which approximately half is driven by operating spend management and the remainder from reduced acquired IPR&D expense. This is about 50 basis points better than we discussed on the Q3 earnings call in October. We anticipate net other income to be $900 million to $1.1 billion for 2025. The reduction versus last year is primarily driven by a lower benefit related to employee benefit programs based on discount rate assumptions, the nonrecurring monetization of royalty rights in 2024 and no longer receiving a Kenvue dividend.\n\nDue to higher debt incurred associated with 2024 acquisitions and the reduction in interest rates earned on cash, we expect net interest income between zero and $100 million. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2025 in the range of 16.5% to 17.0% based on current tax laws and our anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses. Given all these factors, we expect adjusted operational earnings per share to grow 8.7% at the midpoint for a range of $10.75 to $10.95. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the recent exchange rate previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year now estimates a full year negative impact of $0.25. As such, we expect reported adjusted earnings per share of $10.60 at the midpoint.\n\nWhen adjusting for this impact, it becomes clear that our operational EPS performance is considerably stronger than consensus assumed as only about half the analysts incorporated the impact of foreign currency into their models. A few initial considerations outlined on this chart regarding the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, a transaction we plan to finance mainly with debt. We are not planning for material near-term cost synergies. Rather, we expect to accelerate penetration of CAPLYTA in existing markets, explore additional geographies to commercialize the portfolio and potentially accelerate research and development to expand into new indications and disease areas where high unmet need exists. Given this and assuming a close subject to regulatory review early in the second quarter, we anticipate an acceleration of our sales growth of approximately 80 basis points.\n\nInclusive of the impact of financing cost, the transaction is expected to have a dilutive impact on adjusted EPS of approximately $0.30 to $0.35 in 2025. Again, these are very preliminary thoughts, which will be influenced by when the transaction closes and borrowing rates. We will be sure to provide an update to our full year guidance shortly after the acquisition is complete. I\u2019ll now provide some qualitative considerations on the phasing of notable events for your modeling. We expect both Innovative Medicine and MedTech operational sales growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half. Regarding Innovative Medicine, we anticipate STELARA biosimilar competition to accelerate throughout the year as the number of biosimilar entrants increase.\n\nHUMIRA\u2019s erosion curve, once faced with material biosimilar competition continues to be the best proxy for STELARA erosion with the additive impact of Part D redesign. The impact of Part D redesign as a percent of sales will be consistently applied throughout the year. We expect a more pronounced benefit from our newly launched products as we progress throughout 2025 to counter these headwinds. In MedTech, for the first half of the year and more prominently in Q1, we faced tougher year-over-year comparisons, excluding the positive impact associated with the Shockwave acquisition. We anticipate acceleration of our newly launched products to build throughout the year. As we\u2019ve said before, we continue to expect normalized procedure volume and seasonality.\n\nRegarding the P&L, it is important to consider one-time items that impacted our EPS results in 2024. Specifically, the benefit of Kenvue dividend in the first two quarters of 2024 is not repeating. Higher interest income prior to the Shockwave acquisition closure in May, the monetization of royalty rights recorded in Q3 and IPR&D expense associated with the NM26 bispecific antibody in Q3 and V-Wave acquisition in Q4. Given these factors and aligned with sales, we expect higher earnings per share growth in the second half of the year versus the first half. Moving to the discussion beyond financial commitments. We are excited for the pipeline progress planned for 2025. In Innovative Medicine, this includes expected approvals for TREMFYA subcutaneous for Crohn\u2019s disease, nipocalimab for generalized myasthenia gravis and subcutaneous RYBREVANT for non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nWe expect to file for regulatory approval of TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, and Icotrokinra in psoriasis and planned data readouts for RYBREVANT lung cancer overall survival as well as data in head and neck and colorectal cancer and Icotrokinra in ulcerative colitis as well as head-to-head data versus TYK2 in psoriasis. In MedTech, building upon the 15 major product launches in 2024, we anticipate a submission to the FDA for Impella ECP regulatory approval, continued progress on our OTTAVA robotic surgical system and advancements across our cardiovascular portfolio, including electrophysiology, heart recovery and circulatory restoration. So to summarize, we are well positioned to tackle the challenges in 2025, continue to advance our pipeline, deliver on our financial commitments and create long-term sustainable value for shareholders.\n\nOur success is the result of the hard work and dedication of our colleagues who share a sincere passion to successfully serve patients around the world. We are extremely grateful for their efforts. With that, we are happy to take your questions. So I will now turn it to Kevin to provide instructions for those seeking to participate in the Q&A.\n\nQ&A Session\n\nFollow Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Follow Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) or Subscribe with Google We may use your email to send marketing emails about our services. Click here to read our privacy policy.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Appreciate it. Obviously, myeloma franchise is a very important growth driver as we think about history, but also 2025. So just wondering if you can kind of frame for us how you\u2019re thinking about that, both from the bispecifics as well as CAR-T and maybe a broadening into the community setting and the pace of growth here as we think about the ramp in \u201925? Thank you.\n\nJennifer Taubert: Great. Well, good morning, Terence, and hello, everybody. I\u2019d like to start by thanking all of our Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world for a very strong quarter. This was our third quarter with sales over $14 billion with 10 key brands achieving double-digit growth and Terence I will come back to that. That includes brands like DARZALEX, CARVYKTI, TALVEY and TECVAYLI as well as ones such as ERLEADA, SPRAVATO and UPTRAVI. We\u2019re making really nice progress on our launches, including TREMFYA in ulcerative colitis and RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE in non-small cell lung cancer. And just an important note, we hit our $57 billion target this year, a year early. For those that were here back at our enterprise review, we had made that commitment to hit the $57 billion by 2025 and we cleared that goal this year in 2024.\n\nSo multiple myeloma is really an extraordinary franchise for us. And maybe I will start with DARZALEX because our quarter was over $3 billion. It was $3.1 billion and 22% growth and we continue to really build out share across the frontline settings in both transplant eligible and ineligible patients and in triplet and quad regimens. And so we\u2019re performing very well for DARZALEX and anticipate that to continue. And in fact, with DARZALEX, it\u2019s our first brand to hit $3 billion in quarterly sales. So important to note that milestone too. CARVYKTI had a really, really robust quarter as well as year nearing $1 billion for the year, $963 million as we continue to see very strong demand in that second-line plus setting as well as very strong capacity expansion in the US, in Europe and also with a contract manufacturer.\n\nAnd so we\u2019ve talked before about that being more of a stair step rather than a direct linear line and it is performing very, very well and we\u2019re seeing nice continued expansion in the first quarter of this year that will also continue throughout the year. For TEC and TAL both products did well. We report sales, we break out sales on TEC. We don\u2019t yet on TAL. Both of these agents are best-in-class bispecifics. They\u2019re performing very well from a competitive share standpoint. We\u2019ve got them nicely being utilized in the academic setting and we\u2019re working that out into more of the community setting, which will be important for their continued growth and uptake. So in total, multiple myeloma really is a stronghold for us and we\u2019re not stopping there.\n\nBecause of the strength that we have, the assets that we have, we\u2019re also working on multiple additional types of combinations. John, maybe you want to address what we\u2019re doing with the bispecifics specifically.\n\nJohn Reed: Yes. Thank you, Jennifer. Maybe before I jump in, I\u2019ll follow your lead and just offer my appreciation and thanks to our colleagues in Innovation Medicine R&D. We had a heck of a year for the pipeline, 27 approvals, 49 submissions, 15 out of 17 positive Phase IIIs, more than 90% success rate. 9 out of 12 POCs came in positive, exceeding the industry benchmarks by approximately double, 10 first-in-humans, 10 new NMEs added to the pipeline from internal research at a price point well below the industry median and quite an impressive year on the BD front with five bolt-on acquisitions and six new molecules added to the pipeline. So my congratulations to the team. Now on the point around our broad portfolio of myeloma medicines, this is where we are now bringing them together to reinvent the next frontline therapies.\n\nAnd if you were at the ASH Congress, the American Society of Hematology, you saw some of the early tantalizing data where in early lines of therapy front, first, second line of myeloma, we\u2019re bringing DARA together with either TEC or TAL and we\u2019ve been getting 100% minimal residual disease negativity, MRD negativity, showing the impressive potential of these new combinations. Mind you, last year, the FDA declared MD or minimal residual disease negativity or MRD as a surrogate endpoint within myeloma that could form the basis for accelerated approvals. So we\u2019re really excited about bringing these into earlier lines. And then I would also remind you with CARVYKTI, we are now doing studies in frontline transplant eligible and ineligible and asking whether we can replace autologous stem cell transplant with our CAR-T therapy as a new opportunity there to break through with unprecedented outcomes for patients.\n\nCARVYKTI, of course, already is the go-to regimen in the second line setting, the only CAR-T for myeloma approved in that setting. And last year, we reported overall survival data for CARVYKTI in a randomized setting with an impressive hazard ratio of 0.55. So really feel great about bringing CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy as well.\n\nJennifer Taubert: Maybe hot off the press last night. The team was very excited to come tell me. We\u2019ve actually completed and reached our 5000th patient infused with CARVYKTI, both across the clinical and commercial settings. And it is the most successful cell therapy launched in the industry.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now live\n\nJoshua Jennings: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just ask about the medical device or the sector, the business, excuse me, and just the acquisition strategy. You\u2019ve had a couple of pre-revenue swings with Laminar and V-Wave and some other more established more established businesses under the roof. Can you just talk about the strategy on a go-forward basis? I mean is it going to continue to be a mix between pre-revenue companies and formally more fully established business or are you going to be \u2014 is there going to be a shift in that strategy? Thanks for taking the question.\n\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you, Josh. It\u2019s Joaquin, and good morning, everyone. External innovation has always been a very important part of our capital allocation strategy for Johnson & Johnson for the enterprise. And in fact, we are one of the top investors not only in M&A, but also in R&D. We are always looking for opportunities to be able to enhance our portfolio and our pipeline. And in 2024 alone, we completed more than 40 business development transactions. Some of them were big, some of them were small, but all of them complement both our Innovative and MedTech portfolio. Many of these smaller acquisitions were also in our MedTech portfolio. You have to think that larger acquisitions like the case of Shockwave or in the Innovative Medicine side, Intra-Cellular are more outliers.\n\nOur go-forward, it\u2019s always been focused on these smaller opportunities like the ones you mentioned like Laminar or V-Wave or some of the ones we have completed the Innovative Medicines like TARIS or our IL-23 blocker, which are more than $5 billion opportunities. That\u2019s where we are able to create value, larger opportunities have to be seen more like outliers. And finally, I want to underline that both Abiomed and Shockwave are progressing really well ahead of the deal model, delivering on our financial commitments there and that we are looking forward upon closure to start working on the Intra-Cellular acquisition, which is an opportunity to reinforce our position of leadership in the Neuroscience space, which has been always a strength of Johnson & Johnson and also an opportunity overall to fortify revenue projections that you have looking today and also into the future.\n\nThank you.\n\nJoseph Wolk: And Josh maybe just building on Joaquin\u2019s comments relative to MedTech. While the big acquisitions get a lot of attention, to Joaquin\u2019s point, we have a tremendous amount of business development activity across all of our businesses. I think most notably evidenced by almost 40 transactions just in \u201924 alone. I did want to point to the excitement we have around the significant investments we\u2019ve made both in Abiomed and Shockwave. Abiomed grew 15% for full year 2024 and we are seeing constant acceleration driven by firstly, the tremendous portfolio we have. I think we could not be more excited about the danger shock results, which really bring more validity to the evidence base around this portfolio. This is the first study in 20 years to actually demonstrate a survival benefit, in fact, a 12.7% mortality improvement versus the standard of care.\n\nWe also, while not a big commercial opportunity, received FDA approval in the fourth quarter of last year for the use of Impella in pediatric community, which I think is just further evidence of the building confidence around the safety profile of this product. We also mentioned earlier that we are excited to be planning our submission for ECP to the FDA in the first half of this year. This will, Josh, be the first and actually the smallest pump in the world. This is a 9-French at insertion, which expands to about 21-French inside the heart, a lower profile, which we believe that along with its ease of use, reduce further barriers to adoption. And then finally, a smaller transaction, but certainly important to our goal to play a bigger role in heart failure is the acquisition of V-Wave, which reinforces our commitment to building leadership in heart failure and really allows for the active shunting of blood across the intraatrial septum.\n\nA quick couple of comments on Shockwave. It\u2019s our latest acquisition. We closed that in May of last year. This delivered $564 million of growth last year. It is the leading and first-to-market pioneer in IVL technology. And we\u2019re confident that while certainly, there\u2019s a lot of excitement around this category, we have at least a five to eight year first-mover advantage. And this comes down to the fact that we have an easy-to-use system with now six available catheters. We\u2019ve also recently announced the addition of two additional catheters, our E8 catheter, which is our workhorse within peripheral as well as Javelin, which is a novel non-balloon based IVL catheter designed to modify calcium and cross extremely narrowed vessels. And so we feel enormously confident that while big investments, they will make tremendous impact on patients and continue to drive our business.\n\nThank you, Josh.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Alexandria Hammond from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.\n\nAlexandria Hammond: Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on the Intra-Cellular deal last week. For CAPLYTA, how should we be thinking about the cadence of sales growth to the forecasted sales of $5 billion? And I guess on the acquisition, should we expect a deprioritization of seltorexant and aticaprant? Thank you so much.\n\nJennifer Taubert: Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. And we are so excited to be able to welcome the Intra-Cellular colleagues to Johnson & Johnson. They have done such an extraordinary job, both in developing CAPLYTA and their pipeline, but also commercializing and bringing CAPLYTA to patients currently for schizophrenia as well as for bipolar I and bipolar II depression. I think you can take a look at their current sales trajectory, which is a really nice growth curve and then also take into account the filing that has done for AMDD, major depressive disorder. The filing has been done with the regulatory authorities that we anticipate approval for later in the year. AMDD, we believe to ultimately be the largest of those three indications for CAPLYTA.\n\nAnd so we think that, that will be an additional catalyst for growth. So you can factor that into your thinking. We\u2019re really excited about CAPLYTA. I know the company had guided to it being a $5 billion plus asset. We definitely think that it will be as well and think that together we\u2019re going to be able to do even more for patients with mental health issues. We\u2019re also really excited about their pipeline and 1284 and potential in Alzheimer\u2019s psychosis, general anxiety disorder and others. So we see Intra-Cellular as both in near-term as well as long-term growth catalyst for us.\n\nJohn Reed: Yes. About your question, though, around whether we\u2019ll deprioritize other things in the portfolio, absolutely not. Let me just remind everyone that depression is a very heterogeneous disorder and it\u2019s not a disease that accommodates to a one size fits all. We see each of these molecules that we\u2019re developing, having unique mechanisms that can play in different subpopulations. And we\u2019re developing those aticaprant, seltorexant, for example, using a precision neuroscience strategy. So we see this broad portfolio, which includes, of course, SPRAVATO as a repertoire of different mechanisms we can bring to bear. The 260 million people worldwide that suffer from chronic depression. It\u2019s the leading cause of disability and more than 30% of those do not get relief from the ongoing medicines.\n\nThe other thing that I really like about our portfolio is the side effect profiles are so benign compared to the standard of care. With all four of the mechanisms, whether it\u2019s CAPLYTA, which we hope to welcome into the portfolio, whether its aticaprant, seltorexant or SPRAVATO, you don\u2019t have weight gain, you don\u2019t have sexual dysfunction, you don\u2019t have the tardive dyskinesia or extrapyramidal effects that are so common with many of the medicines today. So this is really exciting for us. Maybe also while I am talking about our depression portfolio, I would just acknowledge and congratulate the team on the recent approval of SPRAVATO in the monotherapy context. This indeed allows us to offer SPRAVATO as a solution for patients with treatment resistant depression without necessity to use it on top of standard of care and therefore avoiding those side effects that I just mentioned that the standard of care medicines often bring.\n\nVery excited about that approval. We had received priority review from the FDA for that submission. That\u2019s the second time SPRAVATO had received a prior review, the only antidepressant ever to do so. And SPRAVATO is also the only antidepressant to ever receive breakthrough designation from the FDA. So great momentum and a long-term commitment to patients suffering with depression.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Tim Anderson from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nTim Anderson: Thank you very much. I have a question on immunology franchise and TREMFYA. So with STELARA facing biosimilars, I\u2019m wondering if it might play out like how it has with AbbVie. So in the case of AbbVie they said that biosimilar HUMIRA is actually driven the volume shifts in favor of other brands like Skyrizi. I\u2019m wondering if you expect that could occur with TREMFYA on the volume side. And then on the price side, can you talk about incremental price erosion in 2025 to maintain access relative to whatever the price erosion was in 2024.\n\nJennifer Taubert: Thank you very much for the question. And we\u2019re really excited about the great progress that we\u2019re making with TREMFYA. In psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, but really particularly with inflammatory bowel diseases coming up with the launch in ulcerative colitis now and Crohn\u2019s upcoming. We\u2019ve guided maybe just back on STELARA, we\u2019ve talked about the HUMIRA erosion curve being probably the best thing to model. Specific to your question about should there or will there be patient switches. I think there are a lot of patients in the immunology market right now that are in need of both advanced therapies or are in need of better therapies than they are on now. And so we do see across the board, shifting of patients and movement into the newer and the better products.\n\nI would put TREMFYA squarely in that camp. We\u2019ve got lots of reasons. We focus in on IBD and the potential growth for TREMFYA. We\u2019ve got a lot of reasons for great optimism there and differentiation. It\u2019s the only dual-acting IL-23 agent in IBD, acts on both IL-23 as well as CD64. We think it\u2019s got the potential to really set the next bar in efficacy and we know there are a lot of patients who need more and are ready for switch. And we think with our subcu induction dose, we\u2019re going to have unrivaled flexibility. So the ability for fully subcu induction and maintenance as well as the opportunity for IV. So the launch right now is going very well in UC and we\u2019re very excited and optimistic really looking forward to the upcoming launch in Crohn\u2019s and subcu.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve invested appropriately, last part of the question, I think, was on pricing. We\u2019ve invested appropriately to make sure that we\u2019ve got the right access for patients with TREMFYA so that as we launch, we\u2019ve got the abilities when prescribers want to write for patients. We\u2019ve got the access to be able to do so. And we\u2019re seeing that right now with strong frontline commercial coverage for TREMFYA in UC as well as a permanent J-code. So that is in and sort of factored into what we\u2019re seeing now.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\n\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, how are you thinking about the growth of the MedTech market in 2025 and J&J relative to the market? And what are you assuming for the EP business and VARIPULSE? Thanks for taking the question.\n\nTim Schmid: Thank you, Larry, and appreciate your continued interest in our business. Let me start with the market, Larry. We communicated that the Enterprise Business Review that we saw our end markets growing roughly 5% to 7%. As we look at procedures within the year to come, we believe that they have, for the most part, normalized. You will recall that in the first half of last year, we expected some tailwinds on the back of clearing of the backlog, specifically in orthopedic procedures. We believe that for the most part around the world, procedures have normalized to pre-COVID levels and we expect the same as we now move into 2025. Specific to electrophysiology, I did want to firstly acknowledge that out of an abundance of caution, we recently announced a temporary pause of all US VARIPULSE cases while we investigate the root cause of four reported neurovascular events.\n\nAnd, Larry, while disappointing, this is an easy decision for us aligned to Our Credo. Patient safety is always an absolute priority for us. And frankly given that we are collaborating now with the FDA on this matter, this is all we will be sharing at this time. We will proactively provide further updates when we have additional information to share. I do have I think it\u2019s important to remind everyone that this announcement is specific to the US and there is no expected impact to VARIPULSE cases outside of the US where the rollout of the technology has been successful with approximately 3,000 commercial cases completed. I do think important, it\u2019s important to reinforce that while we are facing a headwind today, we have tremendous opportunity in the electrophysiology space.\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting market, as you know, with relatively low global penetration well under 5%, as you know, and an expanding market size due to aging populations. Today, we have a $5 billion market leading position in electrophysiology, which grew 14% in 2024 driven by commercial execution and a significant portfolio of new product introductions from QDOT to Ultrasound, CARTO and more recently, VARIPULSE, partially offset by competitive PFA pressures, most notably here in the US. Now we\u2019ve been market leader, as you know, Larry, for 20 years and have an entrenched footprint with an installed base of over 5,000 CARTO systems, which is widely recognized that the benchmark in mapping software and a broad network of highly trained mappers. And building on our success in navigation catheters and RF ablation in 2024, we launched our first PFA catheter VARIPULSE with strong initial feedback in Europe, Japan and Canada.\n\nAdditionally, similar to our success in our RF portfolio, we are expanding beyond that. And we recently announced EU approval of the Dual Energy STSF catheter which is modeled on the RF STSF catheter, which historically is the most widely used ablation catheter in the world. We\u2019re also building on this and working on an Omnipulse large tip focal catheter demonstrating commitment to bring to market a comprehensive portfolio in PFA. And so I will also say, Larry, it\u2019s not just in EP, we\u2019re also moving beyond AFib and we\u2019re working to enter the Left Atrial Appendage closure market through the acquisition of Laminar which we announced in the fourth quarter of 2023. In summary, Larry, while we\u2019re facing short-term headwinds, as you know, especially here in the US, we are absolutely confident in our ability to retain our global market leadership position over the long-term.\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\n\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. I just had a two-parter on operating margins. I think you mentioned in the remarks about 150 basis points of improvement this year in process R&D. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on what\u2019s enabling that despite the lower top line growth and some of the negative product mix from STELARA. I guess, I\u2019m trying to get at, should we be expecting OpEx to be down this year embedded in that guide? And the second part was just beyond this year. Just help us think about the cadence of margin expansion as we think about 2026 and beyond and top line reaccelerates? Thank you.\n\nJoseph Wolk: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. With respect to the 150 basis improvement that wasn\u2019t related to year-on-year comparison from IPR&D. I would say that\u2019s really part and parcel to what we\u2019ve been doing for a couple of years now when we had a chance to separate the consumer health business out into its own company, we did take a look at the corporate infrastructure. And as you know, we also prioritized our investments in Innovative Medicine and MedTech, specifically within those portfolios as well. So we came much more focused and you\u2019re starting to see the culmination of that this year. You might have noticed in MedTech last year, we did have some restructuring charges related to some orthopedic moves that we made, getting out of certain markets that were less profitable, improving our infrastructure around manufacturing.\n\nThose are starting to come home to roost, so to speak, in Innovative Medicine, obviously, prioritizing most of our investment into what I would call our thoroughbreds within the stable, so oncology, immunology, neuroscience, as you can tell. And we have invested in technology over the last few years in a pretty significant way. There\u2019s still more investment to come, but that\u2019s starting to yield some benefits as well in terms of efficiency around the organization. So we knew for a few years now that STELARA would face biosimilar competition. And so we had to be prepared and this is kind of how the organization has gone about it. As far as 2026 and beyond, I think, I\u2019d go back to the comments I made with respect to operating margin and probably EPS growth overall that, that will be commensurate with sales.\n\nSo that should be a positive outlook. As you know, this year, we\u2019re calling for 3% operational growth despite a multibillion dollar headwinds. Most organizations would be looking to contract both probably top and bottom line. Here we are growing 3% on the top line operationally and about 9% on the bottom line. I think you could look for maybe a little bit better equilibrium in 2026 and beyond, but with an expectation that we\u2019d have some higher sales growth.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is now live. Perhaps your phone is on mute, Matt. Matt, your line is now live. Our next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Your line is now live. Pardon me, just make sure you hear my audio.\n\nJessica Moore: The next analyst, please.\n\nOperator: Our next question is coming from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\n\nDavid Roman: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I\u2019m on behalf of Christopher Bhutani and myself here. I wanted to come back to just the overall MedTech strategy. And I appreciate that you exited the year over the 7% number that you had previously communicated as the high end of the range. But when you pick that apart a little bit, clearly, a big percentage of that does come from M&A, I think with ex M&A, the organic number being below the 5% to 7%. So can you maybe just walk through a little bit how you think about the organic investment in the business versus inorganic contribution to that number long-term, especially when you start to look at some of the more established franchises of that surgery, orthopedics, your end market? And then if I could just sneak in accounting one in here. I just want to confirm there is no revenue recognition reversal charges in the EP numbers this quarter for VARIPULSE?\n\nJoseph Wolk: David, thank you for the question. And we could not be more thrilled with the performance that we delivered in 2024. And while there are opportunities, we delivered almost $32 billion of sales at an operational growth rate of 6.2%. When you take out impact of Shockwave, that\u2019s 4.7%. And let me be very clear that we remain very confident in our expectations communicated at the EBR. And as a reminder, we expect our end markets to grow between 5% and 7% on a weighted average basis between 22% and 27%. And we expect to deliver an operational CAGR in the upper end of the range over that period. In 2024, 6.2%, as I mentioned and we\u2019re pleased with the continued double-digit growth in cardiovascular, both within our core electrophysiology business and our new acquisitions in Abiomed and Shockwave, which I referenced earlier.\n\nWe\u2019re also proud of the continuous improvements in Ortho. This is a business that historically was a laggard for MedTech, but tremendous improvements especially with the mid-single-digit growth in hips and knees and continued innovation with our enabling technologies and specifically in VELYS. We\u2019re also encouraged by the continuous improvements in vision, another core business. And as you know, we had a slower start to 2024, but we saw that improve throughout the year, culminating in operational growth rate in the fourth quarter of 9.1%. That said, as you know too well, we do have some short-term headwinds near-term competitive pressures in US. EP as one and secondly continued headwinds in China, which we\u2019ve mentioned in 2025 will continue to be a headwind and we have included that in our estimates.\n\nAs we look to the year ahead, we don\u2019t provide guidance by sector, as you know, but we\u2019re confident that continued growth will be driven by our tremendous portfolio of new products, specifically VARIPULSE, our TECNIS premium IOLs, ACUVUE OASYS MAX and Contact Lens, VELYS portfolio in Ortho, our STRATAFIX portfolio in barbed sutures and our broad-based hemostats in surgery. We also believe that our recent acquisitions of Shockwave and Abiomed, as I mentioned earlier, will continue to perform exceptionally well fueled by multiple new products, new indications and a rapidly growing body of clinical evidence. I will say that it\u2019s important as you think about 2025 to recognize, as Joe mentioned earlier, that we expect to see an acceleration in the back half.\n\nWe are seeing some tough comparators when we compare to 2024. A couple of factors will be a positive one-time change in revenue recognition in our Ortho business. Inventory builds outside of the US and electrophysiology and finally headwinds related to selling days versus prior year. And so we would recommend that you encourage you to consider these in your statements for the year ahead. And maybe, David, just to cap off, you asked a specific question around accounting reversal and whether that had any impact on the quarter. There was none related to VARIPULSE.\n\nJessica Moore: Thanks, David, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn\u2019t get to because of time, but don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions that you may have. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks.\n\nJoaquin Duato: Thank you. Thank you, Jessica, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. As you have heard, we are ready for 2025, a year that will solidify our strength and lead to elevated performance for the balance of the decade. Enjoy the rest of the day.\n\nOperator: Thank you.

These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to Johnson & Johnson's results computed in accordance with GAAP.\n\n($ in Billions, except EPS) January 2025 Adjusted Operational Sales1,2,5 Change vs. Prior Year / Mid-point 2.0% \u2013 3.0% / 2.5% Operational Sales2,5 / Mid-point Change vs. Prior Year / Mid-point $90.9B \u2013 $91.7B / $91.3B 2.5% \u2013 3.5% / 3.0% Estimated Reported Sales3,5/ Mid-point Change vs. Prior Year / Mid-point $89.2B \u2013 $90.0B / $89.6B 0.5% \u2013 1.5% / 1.0% Adjusted Operational EPS (Diluted)2,4 / Mid-point Change vs. Prior Year / Mid-point $10.75 \u2013 $10.95 / $10.85 7.7% \u2013 9.7% / 8.7% Adjusted EPS (Diluted)3,4 / Mid-point Change vs. Prior Year / Mid-point $10.50 \u2013 $10.70 / $10.60 5.2% \u2013 7.2% / 6.2%\n\n1 Non-GAAP financial measure; excludes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures 2 Non-GAAP financial measure; excludes the impact of translational currency 3 Calculated using Euro Average Rate: January 2025 = $1.04 (Illustrative purposes only) 4 Non-GAAP financial measure; excludes intangible amortization expense and special items 5 Excludes COVID-19 Vaccine Note: percentages may have been rounded\n\nOther modeling considerations will be provided on the webcast.\n\nNotable announcements in the quarter:\n\nThe information contained in this section should be read together with Johnson & Johnson\u2019s other disclosures filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Current Reports on Form 8-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K.

This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The restructuring expense of $102 million Q4 2024 YTD and $55 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 ($479 million Q4 2023 YTD) includes the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs, asset impairments and asset divestments. This program was completed in Q4 2024. In fiscal 2023, the company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within the MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network arrangements. The restructuring expense of $60 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 ($167 million Q4 2024 YTD) and $84 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 ($319 million Q4 2023 YTD) primarily includes costs related to the market and product exits. 3 European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company\u2019s previously registered products. MDR is a replacement of the existing European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 2021. The Company considers the adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations. The Company has excluded only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The implementation was substantially completed as of Q4 2024, and ongoing costs will be reflected in MedTech's operating results beginning in 2025. 4 The tax impact related to special item adjustments reflects the current and deferred income taxes associated with the above pre-tax special items in arriving at adjusted earnings.\n\nJohnson & Johnson and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure Adjusted Operational Sales Growth FOURTH QUARTER 2024 ACTUAL vs. 2023 ACTUAL Segments Innovative Medicine MedTech Total WW As Reported 4.4 % 6.7 % 5.3 % U.S. 11.1 % 7.6 % 10.0 % International (5.1 )% 5.8 % (0.7 )% WW Currency (1.7 ) (0.9 ) (1.4 ) U.S. -

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat on fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results, but its stock traded down on Wednesday morning to about $143 per share.\n\nSeveral negative impacts were highlighted in the look-back and look-ahead on an earnings call, despite the company beating Wall Street expectations on revenue by $70 million and reporting results on earnings per share in line with estimates.\n\nJ&J reported total sales of $88.8 billion for 2024, up 4.3% compared to 2023. That includes slowing COVID-19 vaccine sales \u2014 a theme other vaccine makers are expected to see with a slower start to the respiratory virus season this year.\n\nThe company reported earnings per share of $5.79 for 2024, up 11% year over year.\n\nMeanwhile, fourth quarter earnings were mixed, with $22 billion in sales, up 5.3% year over year, and earnings per share down 17% from the prior year at $1.41.\n\nBut the good news is somewhat tempered by the ongoing talc case, which has weighed on its growth potential. A lawsuit in Texas is set to begin hearings on Feb. 18 and last up to a month thereafter.\n\n\"From there, the company anticipates the plaintiff lawyers to appeal this decision (if positive) to the 5th circuit in Texas, which was noted as being potentially more favorable on the requirement of bankruptcy (with the added difference of this being a pre-packaged bankruptcy),\" JPMorgan analysts wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nAhead of earnings, Bank of America Securities analysts lowered their price target for the company for 2025 from $166 per share to $160 over ongoing concerns from the talc lawsuit.\n\nIn addition to the lawsuit, J&J anticipates some negative impact from foreign exchange for the year as well as slower medical device sales, with China's slowdown in procedures weighing on the company's potential revenues.\n\nThe company is transitioning into a competitive market, as generics launch for its blockbuster anti-inflammatory arthritis drug Stelara. The drug is also now facing pricing pressures from a newly negotiated price with Medicare, one of its largest customer bases.\n\nMeanwhile, its growth in the fourth quarter came from its multiple myeloma drug, Darzalex, and several cancer drugs. The combined sales of the top six drugs totaled roughly $4.5 billion, or about 20% of revenues for the quarter.\n\nA Johnson & Johnson banner is displayed on the front of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, on Dec. 5, 2023. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo \u00b7 Reuters / Reuters\n\nThe big deal\n\nJ&J announced it would acquire mental health disorder drugmaker Intra-Cellular (ITCI) for $14.6 billion at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare conference earlier this month.\n\nThe company boasted cash flow of $20 billion for the full year last year, up $1.6 billion from 2023.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stock gapped down Wednesday after the health care giant issued light 2025 sales guidance, taking a hit from foreign exchange rates.\n\nFor the year, Johnson & Johnson expects $89.2 billion to $90 billion in sales. The high end of J&J's guidance lagged Street projections for $91.04 billion, according to FactSet. The company also guided to adjusted profit of $10.50 to $10.70 per share, which bracketed the Street's call for $10.55.\n\nEdward Jones analyst John Boylan says J&J's outlook is achievable, \"if not conservative.\"\n\n\"We view this guidance as prudent due in part to the expected negative impact of foreign currency,\" he said in a client note. \"Longer-term, we remain encouraged by the progress we see in JNJ's new products and pipeline, including cancer drugs, robotics and other heart products.\"\n\nBut Johnson & Johnson stock tumbled 1.9%, closing at 145.27. Shares are now well below their 50-day moving average, according to MarketSurge.\n\nJ&J Earnings Beat, Sales Come In Line\n\nOverall, fourth-quarter metrics were in line with expectations. J&J came in with $2.04 earnings per share and $22.52 billion in sales. Earnings fell 10.9% year over year, but topped forecasts for $1.99. Sales climbed 5.3% and met the Street's estimate for $22.45 billion.\n\nThe innovative medicines portfolio shined during the quarter, Boylan said, growing 4.4% on a strict, as-reported basis to $14.33 billion. Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, called out depression drug Spravato. Spravato sales rose 44% year over year to $297 million and narrowly topped forecasts.\n\nSpravato \"is doing extremely well,\" he said in an email to Investor's Business Daily. \"It's been on the market for a few years, but it seems to be getting more attention recently. Also, a lot of their cancer medicines such as Darzalex and Erleada remain very strong. Their blood thinners also had a good quarter, up almost 30%.\"\n\nMost analysts, though, noted J&J's big immunology drug, Stelara, is soon to face patent expiration. But, excluding that, \"I think they're going above their long-term goals in pharma,\" Jonas said.\n\nMedtech Misses, But Analysts See Promise\n\nOn a more bearish note, sales of medical devices were light at $8.19 billion. On a strict, as-reported basis, medtech sales rose 6.7%. But analysts called for $8.22 billion in sales.\n\n\"However, we have seen JNJ spend more time and investments in this area, so we may see better growth in the future,\" Edward Jones' Boylan said.\n\nHe rates Johnson & Johnson stock a buy.\n\nJonas, the Gabelli portfolio manager, noted J&J is expected to launch their Ottava surgical robot later this year internationally. It could compete with Intuitive Surgical's (ISRG) da Vinci.\n\n\"I think this is the biggest area to drive margin expansion in the future,\" he said.\n\nFollow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @IBD_AGatlin.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nEvolus, An AbbVie And Botox Rival, Just Hit The Stratosphere \u2014 Here's Why\n\nWhy Top 4% Guardant Health Surged To A 13-Month High And Topped A Profit-Taking Zone\n\nOptions Trading: How To Start Using Options, How To Manage Risk\n\nRun Custom Stock Screens With MarketSurge\n\nHow To Research Growth Stocks: Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks",

Analysts' were expecting sales of $2.25 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nClose copies of Stelara launched in Europe, Canada and a few other markets last year.

Analysts were expecting sales of $10.59 billion.\n\nAnnual sales of the drug are expected to fall to about $7 billion this year.\n\nDarzalex brought in annual sales of $11.67 billion, making it J&J's biggest-selling drug.

Growth was driven primarily by electrophysiology products and Abiomed in Cardiovascular, previously referred to as Interventional Solutions, and wound closure products in General Surgery.\n\nFull-year 2025 guidance:\n\nJohnson & Johnson does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, and purchase accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to Johnson & Johnson's results computed in accordance with GAAP.\n\n($ in Billions, except EPS) January 2025 Adjusted Operational Sales1,2,5 Change vs. Prior Year / Mid-point 2.0% \u2013 3.0% / 2.5% Operational Sales2,5 / Mid-point Change vs. Prior Year / Mid-point $90.9B \u2013 $91.7B / $91.3B 2.5% \u2013 3.5% / 3.0% Estimated Reported Sales3,5/ Mid-point Change vs. Prior Year / Mid-point $89.2B \u2013 $90.0B / $89.6B 0.5% \u2013 1.5% / 1.0% Adjusted Operational EPS (Diluted)2,4 / Mid-point Change vs. Prior Year / Mid-point $10.75 \u2013 $10.95 / $10.85 7.7% \u2013 9.7% / 8.7% Adjusted EPS (Diluted)3,4 / Mid-point Change vs. Prior Year / Mid-point $10.50 \u2013 $10.70 / $10.60 5.2% \u2013 7.2% / 6.2%\n\n1 Non-GAAP financial measure; excludes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures 2 Non-GAAP financial measure; excludes the impact of translational currency 3 Calculated using Euro Average Rate: January 2025 = $1.04 (Illustrative purposes only) 4 Non-GAAP financial measure; excludes intangible amortization expense and special items 5 Excludes COVID-19 Vaccine Note: percentages may have been rounded\n\nOther modeling considerations will be provided on the webcast.\n\nNotable announcements in the quarter:\n\nThe information contained in this section should be read together with Johnson & Johnson\u2019s other disclosures filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Current Reports on Form 8-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K.

This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The restructuring expense of $102 million Q4 2024 YTD and $55 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 ( $479 million Q4 2023 YTD) includes the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs, asset impairments and asset divestments. This program was completed in Q4 2024. In fiscal 2023, the company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within the MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network arrangements. The restructuring expense of $60 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 ( $167 million Q4 2024 YTD) and $84 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 ( $319 million Q4 2023 YTD) primarily includes costs related to the market and product exits. 3 European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company\u2019s previously registered products. MDR is a replacement of the existing European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 2021. The Company considers the adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations. The Company has excluded only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The implementation was substantially completed as of Q4 2024, and ongoing costs will be reflected in MedTech's operating results beginning in 2025. 4 The tax impact related to special item adjustments reflects the current and deferred income taxes associated with the above pre-tax special items in arriving at adjusted earnings.\n\nJohnson & Johnson and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure Adjusted Operational Sales Growth FOURTH QUARTER 2024 ACTUAL vs. 2023 ACTUAL Segments Innovative Medicine MedTech Total WW As Reported 4.4 % 6.7 % 5.3 % U.S. 11.1 % 7.6 % 10.0 % International (5.1 )% 5.8 % (0.7 )% WW Currency (1.7 ) (0.9 ) (1.4 ) U.S. -

            "content": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nBy the numbers Medtech Q4 sales: $8.19 billion 6.7% increase year over year Medtech 2024 sales: $31.86 billion 4.8% increase year over year Abiomed 2024 sales: $1.5 billion 14.5% increase year over year\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s medtech leader said Wednesday that the company is now working with the Food and Drug Administration about safety risks tied to its Varipulse pulsed field ablation device.\n\nTim Schmid, J&J\u2019s worldwide chairman of medtech, used the earnings call to update investors on the company\u2019s recent pause of Varipulse cases in the U.S. due to reports of four \u201cneurovascular events.\u201d Schmid had little additional information to offer, however, citing J&J\u2019s coordination with the FDA.\n\nThe company is working to identify the cause of the four reported events. J&J will give updates on the pause when there is more information to share, Schmid added.\n\n\u201cWhile disappointing, this is an easy decision for us,\u201d Schmid told investors, stressing the importance of patient safety. Schmid and CFO Joe Wolk emphasized that the pause only affects U.S. cases, and international Varipulse cases continue.\n\nJ&J\u2019s Varipulse pause, while only in the U.S., limits the company in a race for market share in the rapidly growing PFA space. PFA is a new treatment for atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat, and is already replacing standard methods of cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation.\n\nBoston Scientific and Medtronic devices are available in the U.S., and both companies have reported success for their respective systems. J&J was already trailing the companies to the U.S. market, and the pause has placed them further behind.\n\nNeedham analyst Mike Matson, when the U.S. pause was announced, wrote that even if sales resume, \u201cwe believe that the product is now likely to be tainted and that electrophysiologists are likely to be wary of using it.\u201d\n\nThe PFA stumble comes after a successful year for J&J\u2019s cardiovascular portfolio. The business group \u2014 a focus for J&J over the past several years that has led to more than $30 billion in acquisitions \u2014 brought in $7.71 billion in 2024, representing 21.4% year-over-year growth.\n\nAbiomed and Shockwave Medical, a pair of recently acquired companies, combined for more than $2 billion in sales last year.\n\nShockwave, which J&J bought for $13.1 billion in 2024, accounted for $564 million of revenue last year. Shockwave develops intravascular lithotripsy devices, which break up calcium deposits in coronary arteries using sound pressure waves.\n\nSchmid was bullish on the segment\u2019s benefit to J&J overall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident that while certainly there's a lot of excitement around this category, we have at least a five- to eight-year first mover advantage,\u201d Schmid said.\n\n2025 outlook\n\nJ&J expects a normalized procedure environment in 2025. Schmid said the company had anticipated a boost from COVID-19 backlogs in the first half of last year, particularly for orthopedic procedures. That benefit is now over.\n\n\u201cWe believe that for the most part, around the world, procedures have normalized to pre-COVID levels,\u201d Schmid said.\n\nThe company did not provide a financial outlook for the medtech unit on the call. In December 2023, executives said they expect the medtech business to grow at a range of from 5% to 7% between 2022 and 2027.",

The drug first entered the U.S. market in 2019.\n\n\"We want to recognize that this is a medicine that treats a disease that [when] left untreated, depression is potentially fatal,\" Bill Martin, J&J's global therapeutic area head of neuroscience, said in an interview.\n\nAround one-third of the estimated 21 million U.S. adults with major depression battle symptoms \u2014 such as persistent feelings of sadness, sleep disturbances, low energy, and thoughts of death or suicide \u2014 that don't respond to treatment, according to some estimates.\n\n\"For the first time ever, we now have an option that gives patients freedom,\" said Dr. Gregory Mattingly, a physician and president of the Midwest Research Group who was involved in Spravato's original clinical trials.\n\nHis center in St. Louis has treated more than 6,000 patients with the drug, and currently just over 100 people are taking it there. That is one of 3,000 outpatient treatment centers in the U.S. that are certified to administer Spravato, according to J&J's tally.\n\nMattingly said patients can now choose to take Spravato with or without an oral antidepressant, especially if those pills aren't improving their symptoms and are causing undesirable side effects, such as weight gain and sexual issues.\n\nJ&J's Martin said the approval provides \"an avenue for caregivers and their patients to really optimize, personalize the treatment paradigm for each individual\" and determine the best way for them to manage the disease.\n\nThat could potentially \"open up the number of patients who could benefit\" from Spravato, according to Martin.",

            "content": "There are 52 days until the federal government runs out of money. And just over five weeks until Speaker Mike Johnson has said a GOP-controlled Congress would pass a budget resolution needed to unlock tax cuts and other key Republican priorities.\n\nJohnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune head to the White House today to meet with President Donald Trump, the first get-together for the leaders of the GOP trifecta that now controls Washington. Trump will meet with the entire bicameral Republican leadership afterward.\n\nTrump spent the hours after his Monday inauguration signing a wide array of executive orders, issuing threats and delivering on campaign promises. He pardoned 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters; threatened trade wars with Canada, Mexico and China; gave TikTok another 75 days before being banned; withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization and Paris climate agreement again; ordered an end to birthright citizenship (if it makes it through court); declared an emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border; made it easier to fire federal workers; and lots more.\n\nIt was Trump moving at warp speed, as he promised during the campaign. Trump even filmed a video for the College Football Playoff national championship that touted his return to office: \u201cThe golden age of America has begun.\u201d\n\nBut Johnson and Thune are looking for legislative wins. That requires planning, focus and execution, not exactly Trump\u2019s strong points during his first term. Hill Republicans \u2014 especially a razor-thin House GOP majority that\u2019s about to get thinner \u2014 are hoping for a different outcome this time around.\n\nWe spoke to Johnson and Thune Monday about what they hope to get out of the meetings today \u2014 and what their strategy is heading in.\n\nJohnson. Johnson told us he wants to talk about the \u201clegislative outlook for the first 100 days and the strategy on reconciliation.\u201d The speaker said it\u2019s his goal to \u201calign the Senate and House together\u201d on a final strategy for reconciliation.\n\nJust last week, Johnson met with Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) about why he thinks it\u2019s so important to move quickly on reconciliation. Cruz and Graham have been leading advocates of Thune\u2019s preferred two-step approach for reconciliation, arguing it\u2019s a national security imperative to act on immigration and defense first.\n\nTo that end, the House leadership will host more reconciliation-focused listening sessions this week. Johnson said he hopes the conversations will lead to \u201cfinal decisions on the components from the committees\u201d for the reconciliation package carrying Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nThune. During Senate Republicans\u2019 Jan. 8 meeting with Trump, Thune floated the idea of having the Senate continue to work on the two-bill track in the event the House\u2019s one-bill effort falters. Trump said he was open to that.\n\nThune told us Monday night that he expects reconciliation and government funding to be the focal points of today\u2019s meeting. Remember that government funding runs out on March 14 and there\u2019s no deal yet even on how much to spend overall, much less what 12 spending bills will look like.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chance for everyone to touch gloves now that the formalities are over with \u2014 the ceremonial part of this,\u201d Thune added. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s time to roll up our sleeves and go to work.\u201d\n\nHere are the topics that still need work:\n\nReconciliation. The House and Senate need to get aligned on their reconciliation package \u2014 and soon. GOP senators are hopeful that Trump will abandon his \u201cone big, beautiful bill\u201d preference and see the wisdom of two bills. This looks unlikely. Trump told Republican senators over the weekend that he still wants one bill.\n\nBut there\u2019s so much more that Johnson and Thune need to hear from Trump. What precisely are his true must-haves in the reconciliation bill? Is Trump still intent on the smattering of tax policies that he talked about on the campaign trail, such as cutting taxes on Social Security and Americans living abroad? What about tariffs?\n\nThe truth is, Trump would probably benefit from hearing just how messy the process of passing this reconciliation package will be. Johnson and Thune need Trump locked in and listening to the White House legislative affairs team and the GOP congressional leadership. This package can only pass if Republicans pitch a perfect game.\n\nDebt limit. Nothing has angered Trump as much as having to deal with the debt limit during the first year of his presidency. In the Capitol, Republicans have all but given up on addressing the debt limit as part of the reconciliation package.\n\nWait until Trump finds out that he is going to have to do it in a government-funding bill or a disaster-aid package that will almost assuredly be passed with Democratic votes, driving the GOP base mad. There\u2019s even disagreement on that front \u2014 some Republicans want the debt limit to ride on disaster aid. But Democrats are already pushing back on that.\n\nTrump told House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Monday that it was good to meet him during the signing ceremony in the Capitol. And Trump said he wants to work with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer more. He may have to.\n\nDisaster aid. Senior lawmakers and aides estimate that California will need $100 billion or more in emergency assistance to help the state rebuild following the disastrous wildfires this month. Johnson has said that he might try to condition the aid to policy changes in California. This is something that Johnson and Thune will have to get aligned on. Thune will need 60 votes to advance anything in the Senate. And Johnson\u2019s House will be ready to take a whack at blue California.",

            "content": "Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nView our latest analysis for Johnson & Johnson\n\nWhat Is Johnson & Johnson's Net Debt?\n\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at September 2024 Johnson & Johnson had debt of US$35.8b, up from US$29.9b in one year. However, it does have US$20.3b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$15.5b.\n\nNYSE:JNJ Debt to Equity History January 21st 2025\n\nA Look At Johnson & Johnson's Liabilities\n\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Johnson & Johnson had liabilities of US$51.8b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$56.4b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$20.3b in cash and US$16.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$71.7b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has a very large market capitalization of US$354.0b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.\n\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.",

Wall Street analysts expect the company to report earnings of $2 per share, representing a 13% decrease year-over-year. In contrast, revenues are expected to grow by 5% from the year-ago quarter to $22.45 billion, according to data from TipRanks.\n\nThe decline in Q4 profits could be due to increasing costs from legal cases and acquisitions, an unfavorable product mix, and narrowing margins.\n\nAnalyst Maintains Hold Rating amid Legal Worries\n\nAhead of JNJ\u2019s earnings announcement, Tim Anderson from Bank of America Securities has maintained a Hold rating on Johnson & Johnson with a $160 price target.\n\nThe analyst remains worried about the Varipulse product withdrawal and its potential impact on sales. Also, uncertainties about the talc litigation outcome and ongoing clinical trial results remain concerns.\n\nRecent Event Ahead of Q4 Earnings\n\nJohnson & Johnson recently announced a $14.6 billion agreement to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies, aiming to strengthen its neuroscience portfolio.\n\nFollowing the news, Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen gave Johnson & Johnson a Hold rating, citing concerns about the deal. While the acquisition could boost JNJ\u2019s Neuroscience segment, it is expected to slightly reduce earnings in the first year. Additionally, financial risks like increased debt and potential effects on JNJ\u2019s credit rating add to the cautious outlook.\n\nOptions Traders Anticipate a Minor Move\n\nUsing TipRanks\u2019 Options tool, we can gauge options traders\u2019 expectations for the stock post-earnings report. Based on a $142 strike price, with call options priced at $5.53 and put options at $0.35, the expected price movement, based on the at-the-money straddle is 2.63%.\n\nIs Johnson & Johnson a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, Johnson & Johnson stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on three Buys and six Holds assigned in the last three months. At $167.88, the average JNJ price target implies 14.18% upside potential. Shares of the company have lost 6.6% in the past six months.\n\nSee more JNJ analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed this week\u2019s events on Wall Street, which included President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration and several companies\u2019 earnings reports. Cramer touched on the broader theme of business operations, reflecting on how companies generally want the freedom to operate with minimal interference and lower taxes. He posed the question of whether that\u2019s unreasonable, noting that it really depends on one\u2019s perspective.\n\n\u201cVery unreasonable if you think big business is inherently nefarious and all these companies are run by greedy oligarchs, but if you believe in free market capitalism, letting businesses do what they want within certain limits, well that is the name of the game.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO 9 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar and Jim Cramer\u2019s Lightning Round: 7 Stocks Under the Spotlight\n\nWhen discussing Trump\u2019s inauguration, Cramer highlighted that Trump seems intent on rolling back many of the regulations put in place by the Biden administration, including closing borders and taking aggressive steps against undocumented immigration. While acknowledging that not all of Trump\u2019s plans might be realized, Cramer remarked that some of his policy changes could be enacted quickly, while others might never reach the Supreme Court. Regardless, he noted that it appears Trump is preparing for a strong push to support business interests.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that can justify this market\u2019s recent rally. Now, my interactions with soon-to-be President Trump tended to revolve around the stock market, which he thinks of as the true barometer of his job performance. It\u2019s funny because Biden never cared about the stock market even though stocks did great during his administration.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cramer, Biden approached his presidency with a focus on labor and class, whereas Trump has made it clear that he intends to prioritize business and capital. He expressed little expectation that this would change in Trump\u2019s second term, suggesting that there will be plenty of executive orders to analyze moving forward.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line: As you wrap up the Biden administration, even though I\u2019ve been very critical of his approach to the business, stocks have done well. The Dow is up 41%, the S&P is up 58%, and the Nasdaq recorded 49%. Any other president would be proud of that track record. The fact that Biden seems to not be, maybe it says pretty much everything.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 17. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a full-service healthcare company involved in the research, development, production, and sale of a wide variety of healthcare products. The company will announce its fourth-quarter results this week and Cramer remarked:\n\n\u201cWednesday we got some real firecrackers\u2026 We also get results from two household names, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson. I think Procter might struggle with the strong dollar in China while J&J still has to deal with talc asbestos lawsuits and the recent acquisition of Intra-Cellular for $14 billion, which could threaten its pristine credit rating. The market has turned against these kinds of stocks viciously. Too slow growing. I think you can put either way though and make good money just by reinvesting their juicy dividends. Doesn\u2019t help that all pharma\u2019s are under the microscope as President Biden rushed out a series of drugs that Medicare will try to get better prices for. This is the one part of the Inflation Reduction Act that actually reduces inflation at the expense of the drug companies. One of the most popular medicines for instance of the year Wegovy, that\u2019s the weight loss drug from Novo Nordisk will get a ton of scrutiny as the White House put it on the list.\u201d\n\nCramer also mentioned that Eli Lilly has a comparable drug, and now people are concerned that the same issues could arise when it faces regulatory review, causing the stock to drop once again.

Their average price target of about $175 would imply 19% upside from Friday's close.\n\nRevenue and net income are expected to rise to $22.51 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, from $21.4 billion and $4.05 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nAfter a brief surge following the company's third-quarter earnings report, Johnson & Johnson shares trended lower from mid-October through the end of 2024, ending the year down nearly 8%. They've gained close to 2% in January so far, at $147.03 as of Friday's close.\n\nJ&J Faces Unresolved Talc Suits, Credit Rating Risk\n\nThe company faces a number of headwinds entering the new year, including an expiring patent bringing competition to one of its most popular drugs, and the still-unresolved class action lawsuit alleging that its talc powder caused ovarian cancer. Hearings are scheduled for early this year that will determine whether the company's plan for a subsidiary to file for bankruptcy and multi-billion dollar settlement package will be allowed to go forward.\n\nThe biopharma company made a number of acquisitions in 2024, and started 2025 with another deal to acquire drugmaker Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI) for $14.6 billion, expecting to close the deal sometime this year.\n\nJ&J said it expected to finance the deal with a combination of cash and debt. However, the Intra-Cellular deal and potential for other future debt-based acquisitions led Standard & Poor's last week to say the company's AAA credit rating could be at risk, Bloomberg reported.\n\n",

A biosimilar version of Stelara was launched in certain European markets for certain indications in July 2024.\n\nOther products like Invega Sustenna, Uptravi and Opsumit are likely to have witnessed growth. The rapid adoption of new drugs like Carvykti, Tecvayli, Talvey and Spravato are likely to have contributed to top-line growth.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Erleada sales is $793.8 million, while our model projects sales to be $805.0 million.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tremfya is $1.06 billion, while our model estimate is $1.09 billion.\n\nFor Darzalex, the consensus mark is pegged at $3.04 billion, while our model estimates sales of $3.06 billion.\n\nSales in J&J\u2019s Innovative Medicines segment are expected to have been driven by higher sales of key products such as Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada due to strong market growth and share gains.\n\nJ&J has an Earnings ESP of +4.99% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating a likely positive surprise.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 9.01%.\n\nJohnson & Johnson JNJ will report its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Jan. 22.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for J&J\u2019s earnings has risen from $9.93 per share to $9.95 per share for 2024 but has declined from $10.54 per share to $10.50 per share for 2025 over the past 60 days.\n\nIn the past year, JNJ stock has declined 9.5% compared with a decrease of 5.4% for the industry.\n\nJNJ's performance has impressed, as the company exceeded earnings expectations the past four quarters.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for JNJ Q4 sales and earnings is $22.5 billion and $2.01 per share, respectively.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSeveral biosimilar versions of Stelara are expected to be launched in the United States in 2025. Amgen AMGN launched the first Stelara biosimilar, Wezlana, in January 2025. However, Amgen\u2019s biosimilar launch is unlikely to have had an impact on Stelara\u2019s sales in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Stelara sales is pegged at $2.35 billion, while our model projects sales of $2.21 billion.\n\nImbruvica sales are likely to have declined due to rising competitive pressure in the United States due to new oral competition. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Imbruvica is $719 million, while our model indicates sales to be $710.1 million.\n\nSales of Xarelto and Simponi/Simponi Aria are likely to have declined. Generic/biosimilar competition for drugs like Zytiga and Remicade is likely to have hurt the top line.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for J&J\u2019s Innovative Medicine unit is $14.28 billion, while our estimate is $14.1 billion.\n\nIn the third quarter, MedTech segment sales were hurtby continued headwinds in Asia Pacific, specifically in China. Sales in China were hurt by the impact of the volume-based procurement (VBP) program and the anti-corruption campaign. VBP is a government-driven cost-containment effort in China. Competitive pressure is also hurting sales growth in some MedTech businesses.\n\nJ&J does not expect any improvement in its business in the Asia Pacific region, specifically in China, in the fourth quarter of 2024. However, new product uptake and commercial execution are expected to boost growth in other markets in the MedTech segment.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for J&J\u2019s MedTech segment is $8.28 billion, while our model estimate is $8.23 billion.\n\nNonetheless, a single quarter\u2019s results are not so important for long-term investors. Let us delve deeper to understand whether to buy, sell or hold J&J\u2019s stock.\n\nJNJ\u2019s Stock Price Performance & Valuation\n\nIn the past year, J&J\u2019s stock has declined 9.5% compared with a decrease of 5.4% for the industry. The stock has also underperformed the sector as well as the S&P 500, as seen in the chart below.\n\nJNJ Stock Underperforms Industry, Sector & S&P 500\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, J&J appears attractive relative to the industry and is trading below its 5-year mean. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company shares currently trade at 13.95 forward earnings, lower than 15.29 for the industry and the stock\u2019s mean of 16.02.\n\nJNJ Stock Valuation\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nJ&J\u2019s biggest strength is its diversified business model. With last year\u2019s complete separation of the Consumer Health segment into a newly listed company called Kenvue KVUE, J&J has now become a two-sector company focused on the Pharmaceutical and MedTech fields.\n\nJ&J\u2019s Innovative Medicines segment is showing a growth trend. The company has an interesting R&D pipeline that can generate innovative products and drive its growth further. It recently completed acquisitions of Shockwave and V-Wave in MedTech and Ambrx, Proteologix and NM26 bispecific antibody in Innovative Medicine, thus boosting its pipeline.\n\nIn January, J&J announced a definitive agreement to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies ITCI for $132.00 per share or approximately $14.6 billion. The acquisition will add Intra-Cellular Therapies only approved drug, Caplyta, for the treatment of bipolar I and II depression and schizophrenia to J&J\u2019s neuroscience pipeline. The acquisition will also add Intra-cellular Therapeutics\u2019 other CNS candidates, including ITI-1284, being developed for generalized anxiety disorder and Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related psychosis and agitation, to JNJ\u2019s pipeline.\n\nHowever, slow sales of J&J\u2019s MedTech segment, the upcoming patent expiration of its blockbuster drug, Stelara, and talc-related legal issues are some of J&J\u2019s main concerns.\n\nJ&J faces more than 62,000 lawsuits for its talc-based products, primarily baby powders. The lawsuits allege that its talc products contain asbestos, which caused many women to develop ovarian cancer.\n\nOverall, J&J\u2019s outlook for 2025 looks positive. In its Innovative Medicine segment, growth is expected to be driven by its key products such as Darzalex, Tremfya, Erleada and others, as well as new drugs and new indications for Tremfya and Rybrevant. In MedTech, J&J expects operational sales growth to be at the upper end of its long-term (2022-2027) guided range of 5-7%, driven by the launch of new products and contributions from Abiomed and Shockwave acquisitions.\n\nStay Invested in J&J\u2019s Stock\n\nNo matter how the fourth-quarter results play out, those who already own this company\u2019s shares may stay invested for some time as the visibility for a potential resolution of the talc lawsuits has improved, and J&J looks optimistic for a better performance in 2025. Investors with a long-term horizon may consider buying J&J\u2019s stock at the rock-bottom price and valuation.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "We recently published a list of the 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other best soaps and cleaning materials stocks to invest in.\n\nOverview of the Consumer Staple Sector\n\nSoaps and cleaning materials stocks fall in the consumer staple sector. According to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), these stocks are less sensitive to economic cycles, as all consumers need to eat, clean themselves and their houses, and perform other acts of personal hygiene. Consumer staples are thus an integral part of life.\n\nThese stocks generally do not have the highest year-over-year revenue and earnings growth. This is primarily because they are usually mature and large companies. However, the consumer staples sector has historically experienced relatively minute disruption. Stocks in this sector have various other characteristics that overshadow their modest growth. These characteristics include noncyclic and inelastic demand that does not fluctuate with changing prices and economic conditions. They also entail stable revenue streams, reliable profits, low price volatility, defensive positioning, and a reliable dividend-paying nature.\n\nWhat Does 2025 Look Like for Consumer Staples?\n\nOn December 10, Ben Shuleva, Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager, published a report on Fidelity Investments to discuss the outlook and expected nature of consumer staples in 2025. The consumer staples sector had a positive year in 2024. Shuleva is of the view that with sector dynamics returning to normal, 2025 is also expected to have a positive outlook for the sector. Solid consumer balance sheets, a strong economy, and support from the Fed may help the sector perform better than the broader market. Opportunities thus exist in consumer staples in 2025. Stable consumer demand, steady real wage growth, and healthy employment are further expected to support these opportunities.\n\nHowever, Shuleva warned that some uncertainties may affect the sector. These include trade policy changes that may arise due to Trump\u2019s incoming presidential administration, the effects of tariffs, and the potential consequences of the dollar\u2019s strength or weakness. He further highlighted that since most consumer staple products are manufactured in the United States, the direct effects of tariffs are expected to be limited. However, products like Mexican alcohol and Chinese items sold by consumer staples retailers may experience price increases.\n\nShuleva also presented a bright side to the sector, reasoning that since consumer staple businesses have experienced volatility from changing tariff policies in recent years, they are likely to be well-prepared for them. Like other sectors, the consumer staples sector\u2019s ultimate performance depends upon the broader economy\u2019s performance. It is a defensive sector, and defensive sectors are historically likely to perform well in economic weaknesses.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 15 soaps and cleaning materials stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced hedge fund data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders that have stakes in them as of fiscal Q3 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) develops and manufactures various products in the healthcare industry and sells baby soaps through its brand, Johnson Baby.\n\nIt reported sales growth of 5.2% to $22.5 billion in fiscal Q3 2024, with an operational increase of 6.3%. Its worldwide sales for fiscal Q3 2024 were $22.5 billion. Sales grew by 6.3%, with a growth of 7.6% recorded in the United States and 4.6% outside the US. Divestitures and acquisitions positively impacted the company\u2019s worldwide growth by 90 basis points.\n\nOn January 13, the company announced the acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITCI) to strengthen its leadership in neuroscience. It has thus become a broadly diversified pharmaceutical and medtech company. In fiscal 2024, the company invested $18 billion in high-innovation, high-growth M&A. It is also continuing to strategically invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing around $5 billion, or 22% of its sales.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s (NYSE:JNJ) high innovation and high growth strategy is working, and its quarterly progress corroborates that. For the third quarter in a row, it has increased its adjusted operational EPS guidance pre-M&A. Based on its operations, the company exhibits confidence in its growth expectations for 2025 through the decade\u2019s end and beyond.\n\nClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe health care space provided some opportunities in the quarter, as we increased our exposure to medical device company Becton, Dickinson as well as large-cap pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Johnson & Johnson recently spun out its consumer health care business, becoming a more focused yet broadly diversified pharmaceutical and medtech company.\u201d\n\nOverall, JNJ ranks first on our list of the best soaps and cleaning materials stocks to invest in.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson has entered into a definitive agreement under which it will acquire all outstanding shares of Intra-Cellular Therapies, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialisation of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, for $132.00 per share in cash for a total equity value of approximately $14.6 billion.\n\n\u201cBuilding on our nearly 70-year legacy in neuroscience, this unique opportunity to add Intra-Cellular Therapies to our Innovative Medicine business demonstrates our commitment to transforming care and advancing research in some of today\u2019s most devastating neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders,\u201d said Joaquin Duato, chairman and chief executive officer, Johnson & Johnson. \u201cThis acquisition further differentiates our portfolio, serves as a strategic near- and long-term growth catalyst for Johnson & Johnson and offers compelling value to patients, health systems and shareholders.\u201d\n\nWith this agreement, Johnson & Johnson adds Intra-Cellular Therapies\u2019 Caplyta (lumateperone), a once-daily oral therapy approved to treat adults with schizophrenia, as well as depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder (bipolar depression), as a monotherapy and adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. The acquisition also includes ITI-1284, a promising Phase 2 compound being studied in generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related psychosis and agitation, as well as a clinical-stage pipeline that further complements and strengthens Johnson & Johnson\u2019s current areas of focus.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to welcome Intra-Cellular Therapies\u2019 talented people and world-class expertise to Johnson & Johnson,\u201d said Jennifer Taubert, executive vice president, worldwide chairman, innovative medicine, Johnson & Johnson. \u201cTogether, we have an opportunity to impact even more patients living with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, significantly advancing care and helping improve the lives of millions worldwide.\u201d\n\n\u201cCaplyta \u2019s success and the robust pipeline we have built demonstrates the passion and dedication of our talented team, and we are proud of the hundreds of thousands of patients we have helped,\u201d said Dr. Sharon Mates, chairman and CEO of Intra-Cellular Therapies. \u201cJohnson & Johnson has a longstanding commitment to neuroscience, and we believe together, we can reach even more patients around the world.\u201d\n\nIn December 2024, Intra-Cellular Therapies announced the submission of a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Caplyta as an adjunctive treatment for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). In two global, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, Caplyta , as an adjunctive treatment to antidepressants, demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in depressive symptoms, as measured by both clinician-rated and patient-reported outcomes. The safety profile in both studies was consistent with the existing body of clinical data and no new safety concerns were identified. If approved, Caplyta has the potential to be the first treatment approved for MDD and depressive symptoms associated with bipolar I and II in more than 15 years. Additional Phase 3 trials are underway with Caplyta in bipolar I disorder with manic episodes or manic episodes with mixed features (bipolar mania). Positive topline results evaluating the efficacy and safety of the product for the prevention of relapse in adult patients with schizophrenia were shared in November 2024.\n\nWhile its exact mechanism of action is unknown, Caplyta is uniquely characterised by high serotonin 5-HT 2A receptor occupancy and lower amounts of dopamine D 2 receptor occupancy at therapeutic doses. In short-term clinical studies across all three approved indications, The product was similar to placebo in weight change, metabolic effects, and extrapyramidal symptoms, which are often cited as reasons for treatment discontinuation. The most common reported adverse events were somnolence/sedation, dizziness, nausea, and dry mouth. Across all three approved indications, the product can be taken at any time of day with or without food and does not require titration, allowing adult patients to start treatment at the effective dose.",

Detroit led the NFL in points scored (533), scoring differential (+200) and first downs (386) and was second in net yards (6,568).\n\nJohnson was heavily credited with orchestrating the turnaround of Lions quarterback Jared Goff, who had a rough first season in Detroit after being moved to the Lions in a trade with the Los Angeles Rams in 2021.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been lucky to be around a lot of great offensive minds, and he\u2019s absolutely one of them,\" Goff said late in the season. \"He\u2019s certainly changed the way I see the game, and we very much see the game very similarly, but a lot of concepts that we do offensively that I haven\u2019t done before and then coming here and him teaching me why they work versus this, that, or the other has certainly changed the way I see certain things and changed my approach in a lot of ways and the way he\u2019s pushed me, I can\u2019t ask for much more.\u201d\n\nLions coach Dan Campbell said on Monday that he will seek Goff\u2019s input when hiring a new offensive coordinator.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s important,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Ben did a great job of is \u2026 those guys working together, and the system was kind of built from the ground up, and it was to help (Goff) and for him to be a part of. So, yeah, that\u2019s huge. He\u2019ll have a lot of input. \u2026 Now, is it going to be the ultimate decision? No, it\u2019s not, but what he says is going to mean a lot to me.\u201d\n\nJohnson also interviewed for gigs with the New England Patriots, Jacksonville Jaguars and Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nAs coach of the Bears, Johnson will play the Lions twice a season and be tasked with orchestrating another turnaround, this time with quarterback Caleb Williams, the No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft. Johnson said in December that \u201cthere\u2019s no question (Williams) is talented.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember standing on the sideline last game and you can hear the ball whistle by you,\u201d Johnson said of Williams. \u201cHe\u2019s got quite a fastball and has some creativity to him, can extend plays and is accurate down the field, as well. Like I said, I haven\u2019t really dove in and can tell you much more beyond that, but he\u2019s been impressive from afar.\u201d\n\nWilliams said last week on the St. Brown Bros podcast, hosted by Lions receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, that he hoped the Bears hired \"an offensive-minded guy so I can build with him and be with that coach for the next 19, 17, 15 years, and so I can also learn and grow ... from him.\" In that sense, Williams and Johnson are a perfect pairing.\n\nSt. Brown and other Lions offensive players have previously called Johnson an offensive \"genius,\" although St. Brown said he would walk those comments back if it'd help keep Johnson for another year.\n\n\"If anybody's gonna ask me, 'How's Ben?' (I'll say), 'Ben's trash, he can't call plays,'\" St. Brown joked on the podcast with Williams. \"'I don't know why you'd want him.'\"\n\nWith Johnson as offensive coordinator, the Lions have posted winning records in three straight seasons, including two straight division titles. The Lions achieved a franchise-record 15 wins this past season and earned the NFC\u2019s No. 1 seed before being sent home early in Saturday night\u2019s 45-31 loss to the Washington Commanders at Ford Field.\n\nThe Lions finished in the top five in the league in points scored and yards gained during all three of Johnson\u2019s seasons as offensive coordinator.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re one of the major reasons why we\u2019ve been able to get where we\u2019ve been, man,\u201d Campbell said of Johnson and Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, who\u2019s also interviewing for head-coaching jobs. \u201cWe came out of the dump and got to where we\u2019re at. So, man, I will forever be grateful for those guys and our team will. Is it a loss? Absolutely, but yet, man, we move forward, the train rolls on, and I\u2019ll find the next best guys for us.\u201d\n\nJohnson joined the Lions in 2019 as an offensive quality control coach on the staff of former head coach Matt Patricia and became a tight ends coach the following season. Johnson survived the regime change and was also the passing game coordinator under Campbell before being promoted to his first offensive coordinator gig in 2022.\n\nA former walk-on quarterback at North Carolina, Johnson began his coaching career at Boston College in 2009 and made his transition to the NFL in 2012 with the Miami Dolphins, where he and Campbell worked together on the offensive staff of former head coach Joe Philbin.\n\nLions offensive tackle Taylor Decker, who spent six seasons in the building with Johnson, advocated for his candidacy following Saturday's playoff defeat.\n\n\"They\u2019re phenomenal at what they do,\" Decker said of Johnson and Glenn. \"So whatever opportunities they get, if they do or do not want to take them, that is up to them, but they deserve those opportunities, and if they take them, I\u2019m not going to bat an eye at it. They deserve it because they\u2019ve been phenomenal for us, and we\u2019ve been lucky to have them for the time we have had them; hopefully, we continue to have them. If we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t.\"\n\nAnd with that, the first big domino of the coaching carousel has fallen. The attention now turns to Glenn and just how many Detroit assistants follow the former coordinators to their new destinations.\n\nnbianchi@detroitnews.com\n\n@nolanbianchi",

In fact, it may have increased the market for both Aaron Glenn and Ben Johnson.\n\nThe Lions, the 1-seed in the NFC after an incredible 15-2 regular season and a second straight NFC North crown, were expected to make a deep run into the postseason and at the very least, make the NFC championship game, were stunned Saturday night by the Washington Commanders on their home turf, 45-31, at Ford Field.\n\nThat could cause a team to proceed cautiously with regards to their head coach hiring.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said \u201cHealthcare really hasn\u2019t had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher.\u201d\n\nHe added that the US government\u2019s export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer \u201cI still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I\u2019ve got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can\u2019t.\u201d He added \u201cAnd then David, I\u2019ve got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal.\u201d The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg\u2019s thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated \u201cyou\u2019re done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I\u2019ve heard in a very long time.\n\nReturning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him \u201cThe whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we\u2019ve had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed.\u201d\n\nAs for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there\u2019s \u201cNot enough talk about the fires.\u201d The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined \u201cI certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma.\u201d Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added \u201cBut more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it\u2019s going to impact the economy. We don\u2019t even know yet, what could be the results.\u201d\n\nOne industry that\u2019s been at the center of media coverage whether it\u2019s for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, \u201cWell I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There\u2019s a loss-sharing agreement that\u2019s terrible, there is a sense to me that it\u2019s going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it\u2019s obviously not done.\u201d\n\nHe added \u201cAnd I think that if we\u2019re going to talk about what the economy, what\u2019s going to happen, one-fifth of the country is California. Obviously, this is just the South end, could be contained to Los Angeles. But you know David this is one of those things we can\u2019t really factor in but we must factor in, in terms of trying to figure out what it\u2019s gonna mean for the whole US economy.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his thoughts on some of the reasons behind the wildfires. \u201cYeah look I think that we\u2019re gonna look at this, we\u2019re gonna say, there are reasons why this happened. Reservoirs not working. Some issues, whether the firefighters were ready.\u201d Linking the calamity with interest rates, he commented, \u201cBut you know Carl the most important this is at least, if we\u2019re going to talk about the economy, if we\u2019re going to talk about the rate cuts versus rate increases, it may be a reason that we have to put things on a pause. Maybe when the smoke clears. Proverbial smoke and literal. It may mean that things are going to be slower.\u201d\n\nCramer then returned to Zuckerberg\u2019s podcast appearance. According to him \u201cZuckerberg. I mean I gotta hand it to him, I mean he basically made the Justice Department\u2019s case against\u201d the iPhone designer. He added \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if he sat down with, with the outgoing administration, Jonathan Kanter, and said, look let me tell you what I think\u201d the firm is doing. Cramer concluded \u201cBecause everything that he\u2019s complaining about, the Justice Department is complaining about. Carl, it was one of the most damming interviews. I couldn\u2019t tell whether Mark was having fun, or whether he was just basically saying Apple is the axis of evil and others that play along because they all are scared. . . And he\u2019s not scared. He\u2019s tough. Taekwondo. . .it\u2019s a libertarian love fest.\u201d\n\nAs for whether Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks were made to buttress his relationship with the incoming Trump administration, Cramer commented \u201cWell he\u2019s, let\u2019s call him savvy. He talked about libertarian, but there were these moments, you know he lives on a ranch, and he has to shoot pigs. Okay, so he\u2019s pro-gun.\u201d However, Cramer added, \u201cAt one point, . . .it did have a kind of element of extremism that I\u2019m not used to anyone having.\u201d He also speculated whether Zuckerberg was aware of how he sounded during the interview. According to Cramer:\n\n\u201cAnd I think that Joe Rogan is sophisticated enough to be able to put a line out for Mark to really go for it. I don\u2019t know whether Mark realizes exactly how damming it sounds, and I think that it\u2019s a little of a shame if only just because he made me feel like that he himself really despises a company that we all love. I wish that there\u2019d been some push back.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired recently\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 81\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the biggest drug manufacturers and providers of general well-being products in the world. This means that despite facing claims from a multi-billion dollar talcum powder lawsuit, the firm can continue to focus on revenue growth and acquisitions. One such acquisition that\u2019s made the news in 2025 is Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\u2019s $14.6 billion bid for neuropsychiatric medicine provider Intra-Cellular. Cramer had quite a lot to say about the mega bid as he commented:\n\n\u201cThis was an incredibly interesting $14.6 billion deal. Because Bristol Myers currently has Cobenfy, that\u2019s just been approved, FDA, exactly for some of these indications that Intra-Cellular is supposed to be good for. Their drug has been [inaudible], this is Caplyta, since 2019, and has not curried the favor of psychiatrists so far. So I wanna find out how good this drug really is versus Cobenfy. You know and David the other thing I would say is, uh, finally, we are getting deals, and this is the kind of deal that I think actually might pass [inaudible] under the current FTC. But David, it is a sense, I think JNJ has had such a hard time. So many things have been going wrong, I will have Bristol Myers on later today. But JNJ just, is just, where, everywhere they turn, things are not working their way. Including a Boston Scientific competitor that was pulled from the market because of some neurological issues involving four different people last week. So, you know, I\u2019m gonna stay in touch with this area David, but JNJ\u2019s been luckless. Maybe this can change their streak. But I want to hear what Bristol says, because Bristol\u2019s got the one that everybody is buzzing about. Which is Cobenfy. Not what Intra-Cellular has.\u201d\n\nOverall JNJ ranks 6th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JNJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 The Nets are winless without Cam Johnson and are about to face the NBA\u2019s winningest team. What could go wrong?\n\nThey travel to face the Western Conference-leading Thunder on Sunday, and Johnson\u2019s status is very much up in the air.\n\nThe forward \u2014 linked in various trade rumors \u2014 has missed the past two games, and seven of the past eight, with a sprained right ankle that has him listed as questionable against Oklahoma City.\n\n3 Cam Johnson reacts after making a 3-pointer against the Raptors during a game earlier this season. Dan Hamilton-Imagn Images\n\nThe Nets are 0-9 when Johnson hasn\u2019t played, outscored by an aggregate 173 points. But they\u2019re not about to risk their best shooter \u2014 and most prized asset \u2014 by rushing him out on the court before he\u2019s ready. Or more than ready.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early [to know] right now,\u201d coach Jordi Fernandez said about Johnson\u2019s availability for Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a great job with trying to get healthy and working every day and being around with the group.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what we value the most, is his energy, his voice right now. And he still was doing his job [every] morning, and right now there\u2019s no reason why we should make a decision, right? We want all our guys to be 100 percent healthy, to come back, and whenever the time comes, we will make a decision.\u201d\n\nThe Nets have a number of important decisions to make regarding Johnson.\n\nThe white-hot Thunder weren\u2019t just the next foe on the schedule \u2014 their 34-7 mark tied for the most wins in the league coming into the weekend \u2014 but have been linked with Johnson as a potential trade suitor.\n\nThe Nets, in the midst of an aggressive rebuild, predictably have been the team moving the trade market. Since Dec. 15, they\u2019ve made multiple deals involving seven players and seven second-round picks.\n\n3 Head coach Jordi Fernandez reacts during the second half of the Nets\u2019 blowout loss to the Trail Blazers. Getty Images\n\nBrooklyn has executed the only deals involving players making more than $10 million. They\u2019ve been involved in the four highest salaries swapped so far \u2014 Dorian Finney-Smith and Dennis Schroder out, De\u2019Anthony Melton and D\u2019Angelo Russell in. Russell\u2019s $18.7 million salary is the highest.\n\nJohnson would top that \u2014 if they move him. But that\u2019s no fait accompli.\n\nEnjoying a mid-career breakthrough, Johnson is averaging 19.6 points on 49.6/42.8/89.7 shooting splits, approaching the 50/40/90 benchmark reached by just nine players in NBA history. He\u2019s the most coveted player on the trade market right now, quite possibly the only difference-maker available to a contender.\n\n3 Cam Johnson reacts after scoring a basket and earning a foul call during a game against the Raptors earlier this season. USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Con\n\n\u201cObviously, Cam is extremely important for us,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cNot just that he catches and shoots, but also his movement and also he can play up the dribble and make the right play.\u201d\n\nJohnson is also important as an asset. But unlike Schroder and Finney-Smith, he\u2019s a chip they don\u2019t have to cash in.\n\nSources have said the Nets would be loath to move him for less than two first-round picks or the equivalent thereof. He\u2019s been linked with a number of suitors, including Oklahoma City, Cleveland, Indiana and Sacramento.\n\nCHECK OUT THE LATEST NBA STANDINGS AND NETS STATS\n\nBut now The Stein Line is reporting the Thunder may not be in the running.\n\n\u201cOne team we\u2019re scratching off the list of Cam Johnson suitors: Oklahoma City,\u201d the Stein Line reported, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve found no credible evidence of Johnson-to-OKC talks \u2026 even though such chatter continues to make the rounds. The Thunder, like the Cavaliers, don\u2019t want to do anything to disrupt a roster that resides firmly atop its conference.\u201d\n\nWith the trade deadline approaching on Feb. 6, there\u2019s plenty of posturing going on. But the fact is Johnson\u2019s de-escalating contract was designed to be team friendly, just 13 percent of the cap the next two seasons. At just 28, he\u2019s young enough that the Nets could easily keep him past the deadline and deal him in the offseason. Or not at all.\n\nThe Stein Line reported the Kings are perceived to have the best chance to land Johnson if the Nets opt to pull the trigger, with a package of a first-rounder, Kevin Huerter and Trey Lyles the offer to beat. Either way, even if Johnson plays Sunday at the Thunder it won\u2019t be for the sake of being in the shop window.",

The couple, who usually keep a low profile and don\u2019t appear in public often, seemed to be enjoying their leisurely stroll, catching the surprised attention of passersby.\n\nDakota Johnson and boyfriend Chris Martin step out for a quite and romantic stroll outside of quarantine with Dakota's dog.\n\nWith this public appearance, Dakota (35) and Martin (47) have put to rest the speculation about their breakup that\u2019s been swirling for months.

It's also tied to work since Martin and his Coldplay mates are touring several countries in Asia, India included. In Mumbai, which many still call Bombay, the actress and singer were seen enjoying some sweet moments together during a surprise late-night walk\u2014a pretty rare moment of affection for this usually private couple.\n\n\u00a9 WireImage Chris Martin of Coldplay performs at Eden Park on November 13, 2024 in Auckland, New Zealand. (Photo by Dave Simpson/WireImage)\n\nImages of the outing, shared by Page Six, show the pair in high spirits, smiling and greeting photographers. Their casual outfits also drew attention: Chris Martin sported dark sweatpants, a long-sleeved charcoal-gray button-up shirt, sneakers, and a black baseball cap despite the late hour. Dakota chose a black midi dress with straps, paired with black sneakers and a matching cap. Both wore blue shirts tied around their waists, likely in case of a chill.\n\nColdplay, led by Dakota\u2019s boyfriend, is currently in India for five sold-out concerts as part of their global Music of the Spheres tour. This marks the group\u2019s first visit to the country in eight years.

The pair have been seen exploring Mumbai and visiting traditional Hindu temples, where they participated in local prayer ceremonies.\n\nMartin and Johnson began their relationship in the fall of 2017 and have kept their romance largely under the radar. Breakup rumors have frequently circulated, particularly last summer when they were rarely seen together. Chris was occupied with his European tour, while Dakota was spotted in Malibu, California, without her engagement ring. However, Dakota\u2019s representative quickly reassured the media that the couple remained \u201chappy and together.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Backgrid/The Grosby Group Escape from Hollywood!

In a shocking turn of events, the Detroit Lions fell to the Washington Commanders 45-31, ending what had been an amazing 15-2 season, the best in franchise history. Not only did they lose the game in crushing fashion, but now fans face the prospect of both of their star coordinators likely leaving for head coaching jobs. Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn appear to be in high demand. Now, both are free to meet other teams in person on Monday. Expectations are the Chicago Bears will be active in meeting with them.\n\nFor fans, Johnson is the name to watch. He\u2019s been linked to the Bears several times over the past couple of months. He likes Caleb Williams and has been eyeing the job since last January. Some wonder if he might prefer the Las Vegas Raiders after a strong pitch from Tom Brady. Either way, people are eager to finally get a resolution. So when can a decision be expected? I went back over the past three years and looked at every coordinator on a playoff team and how long it took them to secure a head coaching job after the season ended.\n\nDave Canales\n\nLost January 21st\n\nHired January 25th\n\nMike MacDonald\n\nLost January 28th\n\nHired January 31st\n\nRaheem Morris\n\nSubscribe to the BFR Youtube channel and ride shotgun with Dave and Ficky as they break down Bears football like nobody else.\n\nLost January 14th\n\nHired January 25th\n\nJonathan Gannon\n\nLost February 12th\n\nHired February 14th\n\nDeMeco Ryans\n\nLost January 29th\n\nHired January 31st\n\nShane Steichen\n\nLost February 12th\n\nHired February 14th\n\nNathaniel Hackett\n\nLost January 22nd\n\nHired January 27th\n\nJosh McDaniels\n\nLost January 15th\n\nHired January 31st\n\nMike McDaniel\n\nLost January 30th\n\nHired February 6th\n\nKevin O\u2019Connell\n\nWon SB February 13th\n\nHired February 16th\n\nBrian Daboll\n\nLost January 23rd\n\nHired January 28th\n\nThe data seems pretty clear. While there are certain outliers, it appears most coaches reach their decision around 3-5 days after their playoff run ends. That means the Bears should expect a resolution on Johnson around this coming Wednesday or Thursday. Brad Biggs of the Chicago Tribune indicated as much in his recent column.\n\nOne source said the belief was that Johnson likely had his choice of all three jobs and even had the Lions won Saturday, it was likely he would decide sooner rather than later through back channels in order to get to work assembling a coach staff behind the scenes.\n\nBen Johnson likely knows which way he\u2019s leaning.\n\nHe will still take interviews with the teams he\u2019s interested in over the next couple of days. After that, the decision won\u2019t be long in coming. He knows the challenges of assembling a staff, especially with other teams vying for top assistants. No two jobs are more important to fill than defensive coordinator and offensive line coach. Johnson knows that if he can hit on both of those, his chances of instant success will go up considerably. Before anything else, the Bears must take care of some unfinished business.\n\nThey still haven\u2019t complied with the Rooney Rule, which requires them to interview two outside minority candidates. Ron Rivera met with them in person, which took care of the first one. Another is needed to get the green light. It is possible their recently announced interview with Tennessee State head coach Eddie George will take care of that. Ben Johnson will be waiting once that happens. It sounds like the Bears are fully committed to making a run at him. Fans will be ecstatic if they close the deal.",

In that span, Johnson served as the Lions' offensive quality control coach (2019), tight ends coach (2020-2021), pass game coordinator (2021) and offensive coordinator (2022-present).\n\nAfter helping to build the Lions to a Super Bowl contender, Newmark was hired by the Commanders in 2024 to serve as the assistant general manager. Washington has obviously thrived with Newmark's help, also, with the team advancing to the NFC Championship Game this season thanks to the emergence of rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels.\n\nFor the Raiders, the interview with Newmark is yet another positive step toward landing Johnson, who is going to want a general manager he's in sync with. Newmark definitely checks that box.\n\nSpeaking of Johnson: Las Vegas can now hold an in-person interview with the Lions offensive coordinator after Detroit was eliminated from the postseason Saturday. The Raiders are also free to hire Johnson at this time.\n\nMORE LAS VEGAS RAIDERS NEWS\n\nTom Brady discusses Raiders head coach search during Lions-Commanders broadcast\n\nRaiders predicted to sign $112 million former MVP to address pressing need\n\nEagles predicted to pull off blockbuster trade for Raiders $94 million superstar",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other best cheap stocks to buy for 2025.\n\nThe U.S. consumer prices report released this week revealed a less-than-expected increase in December, signaling a potential cooling in inflation pressures. This data has sparked bets on further tame inflation and a drop in interest rates. The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 0.2%, down from 0.3% over the previous four months. This marks the first decrease in the rate of core CPI growth in six months, driven by lower hotel prices, slower increases in medical care costs, and moderate rent growth.\n\nThe data has renewed hopes that the Federal Reserve might ease interest rates sooner than anticipated. Before the report, most market participants expected rate cuts to occur in the second half of the year, if at all. However, the latest data has bolstered expectations for two cuts this year and even the possibility of a rate cut as early as March. Following the release, Treasury yields dropped, the S&P 500 rose, and the dollar weakened.\n\nThe sharp surge in equity prices is not surprising, as lower interest rates are generally bullish for several reasons. When interest rates fall, borrowing becomes cheaper for companies, which can lead to increased investment and expansion. Stock prices are often valued based on the present value of future earnings or cash flows, discounted by interest rates. Lower interest rates reduce the discount rate, increase the present value of future earnings, and make stocks appear more valuable.\n\nRead Also: 11 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy and 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on January 16, Christopher Waller, Governor of the Federal Reserve, discussed the recent economic data and its implications for future monetary policy decisions. Waller welcomed the strong jobs report from the previous week and the latest inflation prints, which he found particularly encouraging. He noted that the inflation data was very positive, with core PCE inflation coming in below 0.2% for the sixth month out of the last eight. This trend, he believes, is bringing inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target in terms of core, despite a couple of bumps in September and October.\n\nWaller emphasized that while the inflation data is promising, it is crucial to see if this trend continues. He mentioned that base effects from last year will play a role, but he is hopeful that a repeat of the shock experienced in January and February of last year will not occur again. If the current trend persists, he suggested that rate cuts could be on the table in the first half of the year.",

            "content": "Earlier this week, a Coffee County Grand Jury handed down a 66-count indictment against Chris Johnson, the former funeral director who stands accused of numerous felonies in connection with the discovery of 18 decomposing bodies in his funeral home, Johnson Funeral & Cremation Services, in October. Johnson was arrested and charged for 17 of the 18 bodies found.\n\nThe 66 counts include four indictments in another case involving the operations of the funeral home, this one for allegedly changing the cause of death for an individual back in 2022. The reason for the alleged forgery was to obtain a greater insurance payout. Johnson, along with former Ben Hill County educator James Sirmans, was indicted in connection with this case.\n\nBoth Sirmans and Johnson were indicted on conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and insurance fraud charges. Johnson was also indicted on one count of forgery for allegedly altering the death certificate and one count of vital records registration for allegedly providing a false cause of death in the forgery case.\n\nAll told, Johnson has been indicted on 66 total counts while Sirmans, whose nephew was the deceased in the forgery case, faces indictments on two counts.\n\nThe larger indictment involves the 17 deceased and their families, and up to five charges per individual case. However, not all the individual cases have all five charges attached. The charges are abusing a dead body, abandonment of a dead body, theft by deception, insurance fraud, and violation of vital records registration. Exactly how many charges are connected to an individual case depend upon how Johnson handled the arrangements and filing of the death certificates; all, however, involve abuse of a dead body and abandonment of a dead body. Only one case has all five charges attached.\n\nHere are the individual cases along with their accompanying indictments:\n\nIndividual 1: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, theft by deception, and violation of vital records registration\n\nIndividual 2: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, theft by deception\n\nIndividual 3: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, theft by deception\n\nIndividual 4: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, theft by deception, and violation of vital records registration\n\nIndividual 5: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, and theft by deception\n\nIndividual 6: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, theft by deception, and violation of vital records registration\n\nIndividual 7: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, theft by deception, and violation of vital records registration\n\nIndividual 8: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, theft by deception, and violation of vital records registration\n\nIndividual 9: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, theft by deception, and violation of vital records registration\n\nIndividual 10: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, theft by deception (two counts)\n\nIndividual 11: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, and theft by deception\n\nIndividual 12: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, and theft by deception\n\nIndividual 13: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, theft by deception, and violation of vital records registration\n\nIndividual 14: Dead body abuse, theft by deception, and abandonment of a dead body\n\nIndividual 15: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, violation of vital records registration, theft by deception, and insurance fraud\n\nIndividual 16: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, and theft by deception\n\nIndividual 17: Dead body abuse, abandonment of a dead body, theft by deception, and violation of vital records registration\n\nAfter handing down these indictments, the Grand Jury wasn\u2019t done with Johnson. There is the matter of the separate case that goes back to 2022 involving allegations of forging a death certificate in order to receive an insurance payout.\n\nThe deceased in this case is Jessie Williams, who passed away on July 29, 2022, after a battle with cancer. A cousin, James Sirmans, a Douglas native who now lives in Fitzgerald, had taken out an insurance policy on Williams. Sirmans stood to receive a $9,000 death benefit if Williams passed away due to an accident and not cancer, according to testimony given in Chris Johnson\u2019s bond hearing earlier this month.\n\nIn order to receive the payout, Sirmans and Johnson allegedly conspired to change the cause of death to blunt force trauma as a result of a bicycle accident. Sirmans was indicted for insurance fraud and conspiracy to commit insurance fraud in connection to this incident.\n\nJohnson was indicted on those two charges as well as forgery in the first degree and violation of vital records registration. According to the indictment, Johnson changed Williams\u2019s cause of death to accidental and prepared a death certificate stating as such.\n\nSirmans was initially arrested on Friday, December 6, 2024, and released on bond. Johnson was arrested on October 27, 2024, and has remained in custody ever since.",

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n\nAfter Coldplay's Chris Martin consciously uncoupled back in 2014 with his partner of a decade Gwyneth Paltrow, his dating life became decidedly more private. Martin seems to have finally found lasting love with Dakota Johnson after previously being linked to actresses including Jennifer Lawrence and Annabelle Wallis.\n\nAlthough they've kept their relationship low-key, they secretly got engaged years into their relationship, with Johnson wearing the engagement ring in December 2020. Here, a rundown of the romance.\n\nOctober 2017\n\nRumors of a relationship first arose when Johnson and Martin were spotted grabbing dinner at Sushi Park in Los Angeles. According to a People onlooker, the pair appeared \"cozy, laughing and affectionate\" during the outing.\n\nNovember 2017\n\nBy mid-November fans clocked Johnson at Coldplay's Buenos Aires, Argentina concert. Lainey Gossip noted that it was the last show of the band's Head Full Of Dreams tour\u2014and that Johnson was viewing the show from a VIP-level vantage point.\n\nDecember 2017\n\nThe following month, multiple sources confirmed to Us Weekly that the potential couple was together. \"Dakota and Chris are definitely dating,\" one source said. \"They've gotten to know each other really well and are very comfortable from one another. Chris sends Dakota his music to get her opinion. It's more than just a fling.\"\n\nA sighting at Nick Cave's concert in Israel solidified this news. Afterwards, they had dinner at Yam Sheva restaurant in Herzliya. \"They came in and they were really, really nice, like extremely nice. It was a surprise,\" an eyewitness told the outlet. \"They sat with Nick Cave too. I didn't see them kiss or hold hands or anything like that. They ordered some starters and not a lot of food.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nJanuary 2018\n\nPeople obtained photos of Johnson and Martin at Soho House in Malibu, California. An eyewitness said, \"Chris and Dakota arrived together in Chris' car. They met up with friends and had a fun night. They both seemed very happy. They were flirty, and also left the restaurant together.\"\n\n\n\nA week later, People spotted the couple walking the beach in Malibu, with a source noting that they had spent \"m0st of the weekend together.\" The insider offered that, \"They seem to be getting more serious. On Friday, they had dinner with friends. They also hung out at Chris' house and went for a beach walk. They didn't see each other over the holidays and seem excited to be catching up now.\"\n\nPeople was reportedly on their date night scene again at Stella McCartney's autumn collection unveiling. They skipped the red carpet, but an onlooker said the couple stayed close once inside the event. \"They walked in holding hands and Dakota was not letting go\u2014she was super into the PDA,\" the eyewitness remembered. \"When Chris let go of her hand, she slipped her arm through his.\"\n\nLater that month, Dakota's father, Don Johnson seemingly confirmed her relationship to Digital Spy. When asked about his daughter's romance he said, \"Yeah, that's... uh troubling, isn't it? No, she's a big girl, she can handle herself!\"\n\nFebruary 2018\n\nIn mid-February, the couple appeared at Ellen DeGeneres' 60th birthday party, an event also attended by Paltrow and her fianc\u00e9 Brad Falchuk. People obtained photos of the pair holding hands outside of the festivities while talking to Drew Barrymore.\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\nA few months later, the pair was spotted walking Johnson's dog, Zeppelin around Malibu. People spoke to a source who gave insight into Johnson and Martin's relationship. \"For the past two weeks, they have spent a lot of time together,\" the insider said. \"Chris lives in Malibu and Dakota seems to love hanging out there. They occasionally go for dinner with friends, but mostly have friends over at home. They go to the beach together, and walks around the neighborhood. They seem to enjoy sharing a quiet life. It does seem they are getting more serious.\"\n\nJuly 2018\n\nThe following month, a Twitter user caught the couple at a Radiohead concert in Boston. They were seemingly on a double date with Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul and his wife, Lauren. \"They stood up for a couple of the ovations,\" a concertgoer told People, noting that they sat for most of the show. Earlier, Martin and Johnson were seen strolling into the venue hand in hand.\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nThe weekend of Paltrow's wedding to Falchuk, Martin supported Johnson at the Global Citizen Festival in New York City. E! noted Martin's presence in the audience while Johnson spoke onstage about the power of sharing stories of sexual assault.\n\n\n\nAs further proof of the pair's bond, they seemingly got matching tattoos. E! spotted the similar ink when Johnson was photographed at the Venice Film Festival. On her left elbow, there was an infinity sign tattoo with two Xs. Days prior, Martin was seen at an event in Los Angeles with the same tattoo in a similar location.\n\nFILIPPO MONTEFORTE // Getty Images\n\nOctober 2018\n\nA week later, TMZ reported that Martin and Johnson were throwing a gender reveal party at his home. Photos of blue and pink balloon arches raised speculation that the couple could be expecting a baby. Both of Johnson's parents, including mother Melanie Griffith, and celebrities such as Sean Penn and Julia Roberts were spotted at the event.\n\n\n\nShortly after, Johnson's rep denied the rumors to Us Weekly, clarifying that the celebrations were for a birthday party and not a gender reveal of any kind. On Ellen the following month Johnson confirmed that sentiment herself, saying, \"Well, the only thing I'm pregnant with is a lot of really good ideas. But not any babies.\"\n\nNovember 2018\n\nAround a year after Martin and Johnson were first spotted at Sushi Park, the couple returned for a casual dinner out. A source told Us Weekly around this time that the couple will \"be engaged soon. Chris is head over heels.\" The insider also claimed that Martin was holding off on an engagement after Paltrow wed Falchuk in September. \"He wanted to make sure the kids didn't have too much change all at once,\" the source said. \"He's a great dad.\"\n\nMartin spent Thanksgiving with Paltrow and their two children, Apple, 15 and Moses, 13. A source told E!, \"Gwyneth thinks (Johnson) is lovely. She gets on very well with her and is happy for Chris. They've spent a good amount of time together and have a very nice friendship.\"\n\nApril 2019\n\nJohnson and Martin were photographed walking her dog barefoot around Malibu in their last public sighting for months.\n\n\n\nJune 2019\n\nThe Sun reported that the couple split the month prior, to the surprise of close friends. \"Chris and Dakota were very easygoing and always seemed really happy together,\" a source told the outlet. Meanwhile, The Express claimed that Johnson and Martin \"could not have been further apart\" when it came to starting a family. A source said, \"Chris made it clear he wants more kids as soon as possible but Dakota's career has really taken off and that's the last thing she wanted to think about right away. It got to the point, last month, where a light seemed to flick on in both their heads and they realized they were pulling in completely opposite directions - so they decided to call it a day.\"\n\nAugust 2019\n\nRumors of reconciliation begin when a Twitter user spotted Johnson and Martin at a wrap party for the actress's upcoming movie, Covers.\n\nSoon after the sighting, Us Weekly confirmed that the pair had reunited. The day after their initial spotting, Martin attended the Los Angeles premiere of Johnson's new movie, The Peanut Butter Falcon. E! also shared that the couple was back together and \"planning to spend more time together later this summer,\" per a source\n\n\n\nUs Weekly reported that the couple's reconciliation came courtesy of Martin's ex, Paltrow. \"Gwyneth is the one who pushed them to do it,\" a source said, noting that the two had bonded at an April event.\n\nThere could be some truth to that claim, as Martin, Paltrow, and their respective partners were all spotted in the Hamptons together in photos from TMZ. Shortly after, Johnson and Martin had date night at East Village's Double Zero in NYC.\n\nSeptember 2019\n\nGriffith, Johnson's mother, definitively commented on her daughter's relationship with Martin. \"I love my daughter\u2019s boyfriend. I think that they're an awesome couple,\" she told People. A source told an outlet at the time that privacy is paramount for the couple. \"Dakota has been filming out of state, but most weekends she comes back to Malibu to spend time with Chris,\" the insider said. \"They are very low-key together. They usually have friends over and rarely go out.\"\n\nOctober 2019\n\nOn October 4, it wasn't Martin wishing Johnson a happy birthday on social media. It was his ex Paltrow, who shared a black-and-white photo of Johnson and her pet dog. \"Happy 30th birthday to this absolute gem \ud83d\udc99,\" she captioned the celebratory IG post.\n\nA few days later, E! reported on Johnson's 30th birthday bash in Malibu. Guests included Martin, Paltrow, and celebs such as Miley Cyrus and Robert Downey Jr. The report said Johnson and Martin arrived at the event together and spent most of the evening by each other's side. \"Dakota and Chris sat side by side watching different musical acts,\" the source told E!. \"Dakota and Chris spent a lot of time together. They walked around holding hands or with his hand on her back. They seemed very happy.\"\n\nDecember 2019\n\nJust before Christmas, Page Six spotted Johnson on a trip to Aspen with Martin, Paltrow, and the former couple's two children Apple and Moses. In photos, Johnson locked arms with Apple while on a coffee run alongside Martin. On Christmas day, Paltrow shared an Instagram of herself and husband Falchuk in ski gear, indicating he was also on the family trip.\n\nJanuary 2020\n\nPaltrow's support of her ex-husband's relationship continued into the new year. In a cover story interview with Harper's Bazaar, she had nothing but kind words for Johnson. \"I love her,\" Paltrow said. \"I can see how it would seem weird because it\u2019s sort of unconventional. But I think, in this case, just having passed through it iteratively, I just adore her. I always start to think of the ampersand sign\u2014what else can you bring in, instead of being resistant to or being made insecure by? There\u2019s so much juice in leaning in to something like that.\u201d\n\nShe also spoke about the evolving nature of her dynamic with Martin. \"It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a finish line: \u2018Oh, we consciously uncoupled; we\u2019re done,'\" she explained. \"It\u2019s a lifelong commitment to constantly reinvent your relationship with your ex, which you do presumably because you have children together. I don\u2019t see a reason to do it if you don\u2019t have children together. Some people do. But I think we put all the hard work in at the beginning. I would say very rarely is it difficult now. We\u2019ve learned how to communicate with each other. We love each other. We laugh. We have the best of each other. It\u2019s really nice. It makes you feel like you don\u2019t have to lose.\u201d\n\n\n\nFebruary 2020\n\nMartin was involved in a major career milestone for Johnson. On Valentine's Day, Coldplay released its music video f0r the song, \u201cCry Cry Cry.\u201d The romantic video's director was none other than Johnson, who made her directorial debut with the collaboration.\n\nMarch 2020\n\nEarly this month, the couple had a rare public outing with Martin's two children. The foursome was spotted by the Daily Mail strolling through Disneyland for his 43rd birthday.\n\nA few weeks later, Martin and Johnson enjoyed dinner at Crossroads Kitchen in Los Angeles, per E!. Johnson wore dark wide leg jeans, a hoodie, and black loafers for the outing. Meanwhile, Martin sported a long sleeve shirt, dark gray pants, and a blue baseball cap. During an interview with a few days prior, Johnson had joked that \"the key to a healthy relationship\" with Martin is having \"double sinks\" in the bathroom.\n\nQuarantine hasn't stopped the couple from sharing some adorable moments together. On March 26, Johnson's friend Olivia Wilde posted a video made by the pair with the caption, \u201cDakota Johnson: Hand wash CHAMPION.\u201d In the clip, Johnson stands in front of a kitchen sink as she demonstrates her hand washing technique. It's soon clear that the actress's \"hands\" in the video were Martin's. The \"M\" and \"A\" tattoos on each of the wrists gave it away. Martin scrubbed his hands while Johnson spoke to the camera.\n\nA few days later, Martin and Johnson made a rare public appearance together while on a break from quarantine. Photographers snapped the couple walking arm-in-arm through Malibu with Johnson's dog on March 31.\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nPeople reported that Johnson and Martin are still going strong and are still spending time with Martin's kids his ex-wife, Gwyneth Paltrow, and her husband, Brad Flachuck. The two are living in the $12.5 million Malibu mansion Martin bought last October.\n\n\"Chris was always a big fan of Malibu,\" a source told People. \"He loves the beach and often goes surfing and running. The source added: \"She seems to enjoy it as much as Chris does. They both love the outdoors and often take beach strolls. They also support local restaurants.\"\n\nMarch 2021\n\nPer The Daily Mail, Johnson has been fueling rumors of her engagement to Martin\u2014with an Emerald ring on her left finger. Neither Johnson nor Martin have confirmed the rumor.\n\nApril 2021\n\nOn Saturday the 24th, Martin and Johnson were seen out in Malibu for a lunch and coffee date, while fans still wonder if the two are planning to tie the knot.

They each wore black baseball caps as they joined arms.\n\n\n\nJune 2022\n\nEarlier in the month, Martin and Johnson were photographed together in New York City. They walked arm in arm, wearing matching pink and black outfits. A few weeks later, the couple was seen in London, where they grabbed dinner in the chic neighborhood of Mayfair. Johnson wore a coat over a white button down and black pants, along with a pair of Converses and a Gucci purse. Martin opted for a low-key black sweater, gray sweatpants, and knit beanie.\n\nOctober 2022\n\nColdplay announced it would be postponing several shows in Brazil due to Martin coming down with a serious lung infection. Later that month, he and Johnson were spotted on a beachside stroll in their home city of Malibu. Johnson wore a white sweatshirt and gray sweatpants, while Martin paired a graphic tee with a baseball cap and baggy pants.\n\nNovember 2022\n\nJohnson put on her own show in the audience at Martin's November 8 concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Johnson told Vanity Fair in July 2022 that she loves to tour with Coldplay when she's not working, and she apparently also loves dancing up a storm to her man's tunes.\n\nWhen Johnson can't travel with him, Martin makes a point of visiting her. He stopped by Boston, Massachusetts, to see his girlfriend as she was filming the superhero movie Madame Web that summer.\n\nMarch 2023\n\nOn the March 19 episode of the , Martin shared how Johnson made Coldplay reconsider accessibility at their shows by introducing him to new tactile technology.\n\n\u201cThey are called SubPacs,\u201d he explained. \u201cDakota, my partner, gave me one as a gift because she saw someone online experiencing whatever they are experiencing with this\u2014it's kind of like body armor \u2014you put it on and plug it in and it connects to the base.\u201d\n\nJohnson had seen the technology being used online and told Martin that he \u201cshould use this somehow.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we started using it and it's been so amazing and it should get better and better,\u201d Martin continued. \u201cWe have ten or twenty now\u2014every night\u2014of those packs and so if you're hearing impaired we have an area where you sign up and you put on the pack and you can feel the show.\u201d\n\nHe added that the SubPacs are expensive, but well-worth it because \u201cthey are amazing and the things that people do to consider other people are just wonderful.\u201d\n\nApril 2023\n\nOn Saturday of Easter weekend, Johnson and Martin were seen in Malibu, California, going on a coffee run together. During the rare public outing, Johnson wore large sunglasses, a black hat, a pair of floral tapestry loose pants by Bode, Converse sneakers, and a Bruce Springsteen t-shirt.\n\nMartin wore a light grey t-shirt, matching sweatpants, and sneakers with a grey beanie. Johnson had her arm looped through Martin's as they walked together.\n\nJune 2023\n\nOn June 21, Chris Martin and his band Coldplay were performing in Naples, Italy, and his girlfriend Dakota Johnson was in the audience. In a video shared by the Daily Mail, the singer covered the stage, then stopped to serenade her where she was sitting to watch the show in the sound deck. Johnson smiled and blew him a kiss.\n\nOctober 2023\n\nJohnson kicked off the month by being a supportive girlfriend. The actress attended Martin\u2019s Coldplay concert on Sunday, October 1, in Pasadena, California, with her mother. Photos came out of Johnson there in a long leather jacket with a black top and light pants.\n\nDecember 2023\n\nOn Wednesday, Gwyneth Paltrow was responding to requests from fans an Instagram Story Q&A, and one of them simply wrote, \u201cPhoto with Dakota.\u201d\n\nPaltrow seemed happy to oblige, sharing a picture of her and Johnson holding hands while standing in the streets dressed for cold weather. Both were in jeans, and Paltrow wore a coat with a hood and beanie while Johnson was in a jacket and cap.\n\nInstagram\n\nIn another Q&A in October, Paltrow said she and Johnson are \u201cvery good friends.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually very good friends, I love her so much,\u201d she went on. \u201cShe\u2019s an adorable, wonderful person.\u201d\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nMartin and Johnson were photographed for the first time in months together on vacation. Johnson was seen in a white one-piece in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico with her partner on Sunday, February 18. They held hands in one shot TMZ ran.\n\nMarch 2024\n\nJohnson shared rare details about her relationship with Martin and his children in her Bustle interview. She called his son and daughter with ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow her stepchildren. \u201cI love those kids like my life depends on it. With all my heart,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for Martin, she said that she loves watching him perform: \u201cI love watching him,\u201d she said. \u201cI could watch him every day. I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I feel like, I don\u2019t know... I\u2019m watching my most favorite being do his most favorite thing.\u201d She added, \u201cWhen people are really good at things, it is [sexy.]\u201d\n\nJohnson also touched on how she feels about becoming a mother herself one day. \u201cI\u2019m so open to that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to this place where I really want to experience everything that life has to offer. And especially being a woman, I\u2019m like, What a magical fucking thing to do. What a crazy, magical, wild experience. If that\u2019s meant to happen for me, I\u2019m totally down for it. I\u2019ve been really tripping out recently like, we\u2019re not here for very long. There\u2019s so much to eat up and learn and grow from and experience and feel. That includes all the pain and the suffering and feeling so helpless about the world. Most days I feel like the most useless piece of shit. I\u2019m sitting in this dumbass chair, talking about this dumbass movie, and there are people in excruciating catastrophes, and what can I do? I do have that incredible friction in myself. And then I\u2019m like, We\u2019re not here for very long, so if I\u2019m meant to be a mother, bring it on.\u201d\n\nDays after Johnson\u2019s interview, a source told People that Johnson and Martin have been engaged. \u201c[They] got engaged years ago but were in no rush to get married,\u201d a source close to the couple said.\n\nPeople revealed that the large emerald ring that Johnson was seen wearing in December 2020 was an engagement ring. She has since been photographed wearing on and off over the years. Its most recent appearance was in November 2023:\n\nRaymond Hall // Getty Images\n\nJune 2024\n\nIn May, a fan sparked breakup rumors by sharing a photo with Martin and saying he introduced himself as single. A source told People on June 11 that they were still \u201cgoing strong.\u201d\n\nThey added, \u201cThey\u2019ve had ups and downs, but now they\u2019re definitely back on.\u201d\n\nAugust 2024\n\nOn August 16, a source claimed to Daily Mail that Johnson and Martin had broken up. \u201cChris and Dakota have tried desperately hard over the past few months to make their relationship work,\u201d the source alleged. \u201cThey\u2019ll always have love for each other but they\u2019ve both come to the conclusion the relationship cannot be sustained long-term.

            "content": "'I got to trust them': Undefeated Crestwood boys basketball tops Garfield\n\nHIRAM \u2014 In the former home of President Garfield, Crestwood\u2019s Lincoln set a tone. And Johnson ensured the Red Devils stayed ahead the rest of the night.\n\nYes, Presidents\u2019 Day arrived a little early at Price Gymnasium with seniors Dekota Johnson and Steven Lincoln guiding undefeated Crestwood to a 77-42 victory over rival Garfield Saturday evening.\n\nLincoln set the tone in roughly the amount of time it took America's 16th president to race through his masterfully concise Gettysburg Address. First, the Red Devils senior raced to the corner, caught a pass from sophomore Brody Durham and drained a 3-pointer to help erase a 5-0 G-Men lead. Lincoln provided a further jolt for Crestwood when he drew two charges and fired a pass to fellow senior Bryce Giel for another corner 3 as the team survived a gritty first quarter, knotted at 12 with Garfield.\n\n\"That's what he does,\" Johnson said of Lincoln. \"He comes in, hits his 3s, he gets charges. Like, I don't even know how he gets them all. I don't know, that's who he is. He shoots the ball and it goes in and he hardly misses ever.\"\n\nLincoln's heroics helped the Red Devils (12-0) overcome a rare tough quarter for Johnson.\n\nThe tough times didn't last long.\n\nAfter a three-point first quarter, Johnson quickly equaled that total with a corner 3, then stepped into two pretty mid-range jumpers. By the 2:30 mark of the second quarter, Johnson was knocking down a shot from well beyond the 3-point line, the second of his five 3-pointers.\n\nJohnson and Lincoln powered Crestwood's 15-0 run to end the first half \u2014 turning an 18-15 deficit into a 12-point halftime lead \u2014 with the two seniors scoring all 15 of those points. Johnson also ensured the Red Devils' roll continued after the break with a step-back 3-pointer to start the third quarter.\n\nThat Johnson and Lincoln hit a flurry of outside shots in the same Price Gymnasium where Trent Jakacki has done the same at a historic pace for Hiram didn't go unnoticed.\n\n\"They've been role models for us since we were at knee heights,\" Lincoln said of Crestwood alums Mason and Trent Jakacki. \"So it's awesome to be on the court that [Trent] played on, and both Mason and Trent have been an amazing role model for us and they are constantly lifting us up, giving us advice, and, yeah, it helps.\"\n\nBob Lieberth's wisdom comes in handy for Crestwood\n\nBob Lieberth couldn't escape the credit.\n\nCrestwood coach Josh Jakacki's longtime trusty assistant got plenty of kudos in Saturday's aftermath, first for Lincoln's charges.\n\n\"I just give it to Coach Bob,\" Lincoln said. \"He's constantly harping to take charges, and it just so happens that I'd be in the right spot at the right time thanks to Coach Bob because he's taught me all I know about sliding in, being help-side defense, being willing to put your body on the line for the betterment of the team.\"\n\nLieberth also deserved credit for Johnson's second-quarter rampage. It was Lieberth, per Jakacki, who pushed for the senior's return to the floor after two early fouls.\n\n\"Bob Lieberth is like, 'Josh, we got to trust him,' so we put him in and I'm glad we did because he made some shots to get us going, to get us that lead,\" Jakacki said. \"He is one of the greats for a reason. He has the ability to put the ball in the basket and do some things that are hard to counter.\"\n\nUpon his return, it didn't matter that Johnson had made just 1 of 5 shots in the first quarter. The senior has earned the green light.\n\nAlways.\n\n\"I'm never going to tell him not to shoot,\" Jakacki said. \"Obviously, some are untimely, but he's put in so much time into his craft and we've spent so many hours in a quiet gym putting in work that it comes down to trust, and I think that's what makes this team special is they trust each other.\"\n\nThat trust was evident on a night when the Red Devils bounced back from a slow start to hit 13 3s, with Johnson (29 points, 5 of 11 from deep), Lincoln (14 points, 4 of 10) and Durham (13 points, 3 of 7) leading the way.\n\nIn the second quarter, Crestwood shot roughly 50% from the field. In the third, the Red Devils were somehow even better, making 9 of 14 from the floor. They knocked down four 3-pointers in both quarters.\n\n\"Dekota got hot, Brody hit some shots deep, Steven hit some shots, like they're all encouraging and loving the fact that it was happening in [the] flow of things,\" Jakacki said. \"It wasn't like they were orchestrated. It was within the flow of the offense, and when the guys were feeling it, I got to trust them because of the work they've put in. And I'm super proud of where we're at, but not satisfied because I think we can get better. I think we still have a higher ceiling. We got to continue to stay healthy, lucky and humble.\"\n\nA doubleheader sweep for Crestwood\n\nSimilar to the boys game, Garfield hung around early in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader.\n\nWith the G-Men trailing 13-6 after a quarter, junior Mandy Cardinal scored 10 of her game-high 21 points in the second and Kaelyn Tasker buried a buzzer-beater from the foul ine to put Garfield in front by a point at the half.\n\nCrestwood took over the same way it built its first-quarter lead \u2014 forcing turnovers \u2014 en route to a 45-34 win.\n\nThe Red Devils (12-4) forced 12 turnovers while holding the G-Men to six points in the third quarter. Midway through the quarter, Hannah Ward found fellow senior Maddie Dustman for four points off two baseline inbound passes. Speedy sophomore Livia Martini then turned a tip-out steal into a fast-break finish as Crestwood pulled away for good.\n\nWard (18), Dustman (10), Becca Brady (eight) and Martini (seven) combined to score 43 of the Red Devils' 45 points.",

On January 17, the pair were photographed holding hands in Mumbai, waving and smiling for the camera while wearing similar baseball caps and casual attire.\n\nWhile Johnson was dressed in a black dress and sneakers with a button-up shirt tied around her waist, Martin wore a gray long-sleeve shirt and black pants with his own kicks. You can see the photos here.\n\nDuring their visit, the pair were also spotted visiting the Babulnath Temple in Mumbai, where they took part in traditional ceremonies and introduced themselves to fans.\n\n2024\n\nDecember 2024: In a new interview with Rolling Stone, Martin refused to discuss those Dakota Johnson breakup rumors, though writer Alex Morris claims she was mentioned a few times in passing. \u201cIt is important to say that [romantic love] is such a big factor in everything, even though it feels right to keep it precious and private,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI\u2019m not denying its power.\u201d\n\nHe later name-checked Johnson as one of his \u201cbest friends,\u201d a list he says includes \u201cPhil [Harvey], Dakota, Jonny [Buckland], Will [Champion], and Guy [Berryman].

All three white men, who used pickup trucks and guns to try to corral the 25-year-old Black man, are now serving life sentences for murder and federal hate crimes.\n\nBut all three men avoided arrest for more than two months as Greg McMichael and Johnson kept in touch by phone, court records show.\n\nGet top local stories in DFW delivered to you every morning with NBC DFW's News Headlines newsletter. SIGN UP SIGN UP\n\nNearly five years later, Johnson is going to trial on charges that she used her office to interfere with police investigating Arbery\u2019s killing. Jury selection is scheduled to start Tuesday in Brunswick, a port city 70 miles (112 kilometers) south of Savannah.\n\nHere are key things to know about the case.\n\nHow was Ahmaud Arbery killed?\n\nArbery was a frequent runner and his route often included the Satilla Shores subdivision where he was killed in coastal Glynn County, less than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from his home.\n\nWhen Arbery ran past the McMichaels' property on Sept. 23, 2020, the father and son grabbed guns and gave chase. Bryan joined them in his own truck and was recording cellphone video when the McMichaels stopped in the road ahead of Arbery, who tried to run around them. The video showed Travis McMichael shooting Arbery at point-blank range as they grappled over his shotgun.\n\nPolice found Arbery was unarmed and carried no stolen property, but they let the men go home. The incident report quoted Greg McMichael saying they suspected Arbery had been stealing from a neighboring home under construction and that his son fired his gun in self-defense.\n\nTwo months later, Bryan's video leaked online, triggering outrage as Arbery's death became part of a broader outcry over racial injustice that followed the 2020 police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky.\n\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case from local police. The McMichaels were quickly arrested, as was Bryan two weeks later.\n\nWho is Jackie Johnson and why was she charged?\n\nAt the time Arbery was killed, Johnson had served for a decade as district attorney for southeast Georgia's Brunswick Judicial Circuit. Greg McMichael worked in her office as an investigator before retiring in 2019.\n\nBecause of that connection, Johnson has said she immediately recused her office from handling the case. A neighboring district attorney, George Barnhill, became the first of three outside prosecutors appointed to take over. He soon concluded the McMichaels were legally attempting to detain Arbery and that the shooting was justified.\n\nGeorgia Attorney General Chris Carr ordered an investigation of the two prosecutors in May 2020 soon after the McMichaels were arrested. Carr said he appointed Barnhill based on Johnson's recommendation, but wasn't told Barnhill already had advised police that Arbery's killing wasn't a crime.\n\nWhen voters ousted Johnson in the November 2020 election, she largely blamed the controversy surrounding Arbery's killing and insisted she had done nothing wrong.\n\nThe former prosecutor became a criminal defendant when a grand jury indicted Johnson on Sept. 2, 2021. Carr announced his office was prosecuting the case.\n\nWhat crimes do prosecutors say Johnson committed?\n\nJohnson is charged with violating her oath of office, a felony punishable by one to five years in prison, by using her position to show \u201cfavor and affection\u201d to Greg McMichael.\n\nThe indictment also charges her with a misdemeanor \u2014 hindering police investigating the shooting \u2014 by \"directing that Travis McMichael should not be placed under arrest.\u201d\n\nJohnson told The Associated Press in 2020 that no one in her office told police not to make arrests. Her lead defense attorney, Brian Steel, said during a December pretrial hearing that Johnson was focused on seeking an unrelated high-profile indictment and \u201cdidn\u2019t know what was going on with Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s case.\u201d\n\nProsecutors haven't disclosed much of their trial evidence, but said in court records that 16 calls were made between cellphone numbers for Greg McMichael and Johnson in the weeks following the shooting.\n\nHow will a jury be picked?\n\nJury duty notices were mailed to 500 county residents, which is more than normal, to facilitate selecting an impartial jury, Glynn County Superior Court Clerk Rebecca Walden said.\n\nPotential jurors reporting to the courthouse Tuesday morning will be questioned about what they have read or heard about the case. Walden said she suspects it could take a week or more to arrive at a final jury of 12 members plus alternates.\n\nWhy did it take so long for Johnson to stand trial?\n\nJohnson's case has taken three years and four months to go to trial.\n\nPresiding will be Senior Judge John R. Turner, who told the AP in October that the long wait was unavoidable because Steel, Johnson's lead attorney, spent nearly two years in an Atlanta courtroom defending Grammy-winning rapper Young Thug in a prolonged racketeering and gang trial.\n\nFive days after the rapper agreed to a plea deal in Oct. 31, Turner ordered Johnson to make her first court appearance and scheduled her January trial.",

A 15-2 regular season campaign goes to waste for Detroit, and now Johnson will turn his attention toward head coaching jobs.\n\nAccording to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Las Vegas is \"enamored\" with Johnson and views him as the top candidate for their head coaching vacancy. Additionally, minority owner Tom Brady, who was on the call during the Lions' playoff loss on Saturday, has played a significant role in the Raiders' pursuit of Detroit's offensive coordinator.\n\nLas Vegas met virtually with Johnson on Jan.10 but will now have the chance to interview and meet with him in person starting Monday.\n\nThough Johnson has been the technician behind one of the league's most dynamic offenses over the last three seasons, the 38-year-old didn't call his best game on Saturday.\n\nDetroit's offense looked out of sync for most of the night, and Johnson had some questionable play calls, including dialing up a wide receiver pass from Jameson Williams, which was intercepted, while the Lions trailed by ten points late in the fourth quarter. Williams' interception was one of five turnovers committed by the unit, with the other four being three interceptions and a lost fumble from quarterback Jared Goff.\n\nWith the Lions' offense underwhelming in the divisional round, should Las Vegas avoid hiring Johnson and look elsewhere to fill their head coaching vacancy?\n\nThe answer is a big no. Though Johnson coached an uninspiring game in the divisional round versus Washington, the South Carolina native is still one of the most innovative offensive minds in football and has the potential to be a franchise-changing head coach.\n\nDetroit's shocking playoff loss shouldn't change the fact that Johnson is still a high-level head coaching candidate and arguably the most coveted name on the market. Las Vegas should do all they can to secure the Lions coordinator as their next head coach.\n\nMORE LAS VEGAS RAIDERS NEWS\n\nTom Brady discusses Raiders head coach search during Lions-Commanders broadcast\n\nRaiders predicted to sign $112 million former MVP to address pressing need\n\nEagles predicted to pull off blockbuster trade for Raiders $94 million superstar",

However, after several years of deals, shareholders must wonder if an attractive valuation is enough to consider JNJ stock in 2025. Remove Ads\n\nIs It Time for the Company\u2019s Investments to Pay Off?\n\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is an adapt-or-die industry. Among medical stocks, Johnson & Johnson is well equipped to prosper in this industry. In addition to its diversified pipeline, the company\u2019s robust balance sheet allows it to grow through acquisition.\n\nIntra-Cellular is the latest example of this, but it\u2019s not the only deal that JNJ has made in recent years. In 2024, the company paid $13.1 billion for Shockwave Medical, and in 2022, it bought Abiomed for $16.6 billion.\n\nThis year, Johnson & Johnson is forecast to generate $88.5 billion in revenue. That's down about 4% from the prior year. The company\u2019s ability to pay for these acquisitions is not in question, and it isn\u2019t taking an appreciable bite out of the company\u2019s earnings. But it is raising the company\u2019s net debt to a somewhat uncomfortable 66% level.\n\nNevertheless, investors are rallying toward biopharma companies with GLP-1 drugs; some may want Johnson & Johnson's investments to pay off in the form of revenue before assigning a premium value to the stock. That\u2019s reflected in their wait-and-see approach to JNJ stock. The company carried the dubious distinction of being one of the \u201cDogs of the Dow\u201d in 2024. In the last three years, the total return of JNJ stock has come in at 5.3% negative.

The company has been increasing its dividend for 62 consecutive years, and the company\u2019s rock-solid balance sheet backs that dividend.\n\nAnd with the stock down about 10% in 2024 compared to the S&P 500\u2019s return of around 21%, there\u2019s room for JNJ to play catch up as investors rotate out of technology stocks and look for areas of growth.\n\nJNJ\u2019s Path to Recovery: What Investors Should Watch\n\nJNJ stock has been trading below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) since late October. That coincided with the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings report. However, as of midday trading on January 16, 2025, the stock is within 2% of that technically significant mark.\n\nA key catalyst for the stock may come when the company reports earnings on January 22. A significant breakout above that level may be a sign that investors are becoming more bullish on this undervalued dividend king.\n\nA breakout above the 50-day SMA would also coincide with the Johnson & Johnson analyst forecasts on MarketBeat, which give JNJ stock a consensus price target of $174.41.

            "content": "Illustration by Brave Buffalo\n\nShare\n\nORCHARD PARK, NY \u2014 Aerial footage only adds to the absurdity of the play that fueled the Buffalo Bills\u2019 wild card win. First, you see the running back trot in motion and take off on a wheel route. He\u2019s window dressing. A decoy. The Denver Broncos are not fooled. Swooping up the left sideline, Ty Johnson looks back toward his quarterback to see if the ball\u2019s spit out to one of the wideouts breaking on their pivot routes.\n\nIt is not. So, he improvises.\n\nThe 5-foot-10, 210-pounder scrambles to get parallel with Josh Allen roughly 44 yards away. As the ball arrives underneath his forearms, he manages to simultaneously drag his right knee across the blue paint. The degree of difficulty is extreme, yet both parties involved make this look like a breeze.\n\nYou know the MVP candidate.\n\nNow meet the 27-year-old flexing his biceps in the end zone.\n\nThis canvas of tattoos rocking a septum ring, an industrial piercing and an untamed mane is everything that everybody inside of the Bills locker room desperately needs into the game of their collective lives. Buffalo hosts the Baltimore Ravens at 6:30 p.m. (EST) on Sunday inside Highmark Stadium. An arctic blast could drop wind chills below zero. Heartbeats, conversely, run the risk of spiking to record highs. These Bills could easily become strangulated by here-we-go-again dread on the heels of five straight demoralizing postseason defeats.\n\nBrandon Beane took steps to address those nerves. The team\u2019s general manager valued the influx of new players who don\u2019t bring \u201cscars\u201d to this moment.\n\nSean McDermott has made a concerted effort to loosen up, and get this team to imagine everything that can go right vs. what could go wrong. When Cael Sanderson told him that he became a better wrestling coach when he realized coaching wasn\u2019t all that important, a light bulb went off. McDermott\u2019s goal now is to serve more of a \u201cDad\u201d-like role, to be whatever he can for players day to day. Crucial self-reflection for a coach whose former assistants felt the entire building mirror his nervousness the week of playoff games past.\n\nStill, players win games. Eleven moving parts must play 150 snaps with a clear mind. It\u2019s no coincidence that some treat such pressure as a trip to the local Starbucks, while others tremble in fear. Legacies are on the line. This city\u2019s been starving for a title. Your life could change forever in a split-second. Thus, these Bills have every reason to urinate down their pant leg when the national anthem blares. All week, players have made it clear they\u2019re trying their best to treat this week like any other.\n\nThey\u2019d sure be wise to follow the lead of the man with the word \u201cManifest\u201d tatted on his right shoulder.\n\nIt\u2019s no accident that Ty Johnson always finds himself in the right place at the right time. His conscience is clear. His perspective is refreshing. As the team\u2019s third-down back says, it\u2019s hard to get into the NFL and even harder to stay in the NFL. He\u2019ll have fun while it lasts.\n\n\u201cWe tend to forget it\u2019s a kid\u2019s game first,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just get paid a king\u2019s ransom.\u201d\n\nGranted, there will be a moment on Sunday when somebody inside of this locker room will have the opportunity to play hero. Stefon Diggs got his chance vs. the Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round last season, and dropped Allen\u2019s gift from the heavens. Bring up the reality of this profession \u2014 the fact that this is when reputations are cemented, the fact that players like him are replaced year \u2018round \u2014 and Johnson, again, declares football \u201ca kid\u2019s game.\u201d Then, he offers a few words that are more helpful than any X \u2018n O permutation devised by McDermott\u2019s staff on a whiteboard.\n\n\u201cWe as fans, players, coaches, whatever, we take this game way more serious than it needs to be,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cIt\u2019s really just like, \u2018Damn, just have fun with it. Play, have fun, laugh.\u2019 Know what I\u2019m saying? There\u2019s going to be mishaps and negative things that happen, but shit, it\u2019s football.\u201d\n\nGo Long is your own home for longform in the NFL.\n\nWe are completely powered by you.\n\nThe best play we\u2019ve seen in the playoffs so far is the direct result of everything that happened in the spring of 2023. That\u2019s when Ty Johnson tore his pectoral muscle while working out. An injury that easily could\u2019ve ejected him into 9-to- 5 life on the spot. On April 26, 2023, Johnson was abruptly released by the New York Jets with a \u201cnon-football injury designation\u201d and the NFL wouldn\u2019t touch him for four months. He bided his time in Miami, Fla., with renowned trainer Pete Bommarito.\n\nNot only did Johnson rehabilitate that pec \u2014 this is precisely when he sharpened his mind.\n\nHe embraced the power of \u201cmanifestation,\u201d writing and speaking outcomes into existence.\n\nHe told himself that whatever he wanted in life was within reach if he simply took it.\n\n\u201cI believe if you put in the work and you put yourself in position, the universe will give you everything you ask for,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cAs long as you put yourself in that space to receive it. I don\u2019t make plays or anything like that from half-assing throughout practice or not being locked in on meetings. It really comes down to always putting myself in the best position possible for the outcome that I want to speak into existence.\n\n\u201cYou can want to grow flowers, but if you don\u2019t water \u2018em, they won\u2019t grow.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn total NFL limbo, Johnson studied the 12 Laws of the Universe. Life, he realized, is \u201ca circle.\u201d If something happens \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing he can do to change it \u2014 why worry? Two of those laws specifically spoke to him: the law of attraction (the idea that positive thoughts bring positive outcomes to our lives) and the law of correspondence (the idea that everything happening around us is a direct reflection of what\u2019s happening inside of us).\n\nThat May, on Instagram, Johnson admitted he suffered through \u201cdark, dark days.\u201d From a cold tub, Johnson explained that he reported that injury directly to the Jets and the team\u2019s doctor instructed him to get it fixed ASAP. He flew out the next day for surgery and was promptly released that following Wednesday.\n\nIt took until late August for Johnson to get signed again with Buffalo stashing him on its practice squad.\n\nAfter the Bills limped to a 5-5 start and fired their offensive coordinator, it was finally time for Johnson to put all of this Zen to the test. His amplified role coincided with the team\u2019s December surge. He took one fourth-and-1 catch to the house against the Jets, finished with 194 total yards and, one day, a hearty debate broke out amongst the running backs: Who\u2019s fastest? When Johnson regaled all with tales of his 40, teammates didn\u2019t believe him. Position coach Kelly Skipper checked with the Bills front office and reported back that Johnson had a time of 4.33. Jaws practically hit the floor. The Bills clearly found a gem in that NFL K-Mart bin.\n\nOne of Beane\u2019s easiest decisions was to re-sign Johnson this past spring at $1.29 million.\n\nThere\u2019s been an ample amount of food on the plate of this receiving weapon.\n\nDuring the regular reason, Johnson totaled 497 total yards with four touchdowns. He\u2019s proven fully capable of both stonewalling linebackers in pass pro and toasting them out of the flat as a receiver. This week, Allen dubbed Johnson the best third-down back in the league and it\u2019s easy to see why the MVP-caliber QB trusts him so much. Johnson has caught 25 of the 32 passes thrown his way as a Bill, good for a 78 percent catch rate. His value is obvious.\n\n\u201cWorks hard. Finishes every play. Hell of a blocking running back,\u201d tight end Dawson Knox says. \u201cBut he\u2019s an unselfish guy, too. He\u2019s celebrating when other guys are making big plays, and then when the ball comes to him? He makes unbelievable catches. Unbelievable run after catch ability.\u201d\n\nOnly good things seem to happen when the ball is in the hands of No. 26. None of it is an accident.\n\nTo manifest, Johnson writes down \u201caffirmations\u201d throughout the week.\n\n\u201cWriting down that I\u2019m great. I know my job. I know my execution. I know how to execute and I know I\u2019ve prepared correctly,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cSo I find comfort in that \u2014 knowing that when the time comes, I\u2019m going to make those plays because I put in the time and the work. I understand that week\u2019s game plan.\u201d\n\nAffirmations are jotted down on sticky notes attached to the mirror of his downstairs bathroom. That way, Johnson sees them all day. After Buffalo took the AFC East for a fifth straight season, Johnson wrote on one: \u201cKeep going. Keep faith. Be present.\u201d On another, \u201cBe where your feet are.\u201d\n\nEach gameday, he\u2019ll also write a message on his wrist tape so he\u2019s able to read it during the game.\n\n\u201cHammering those thoughts into my head,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cA constant reminder at all times.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe cavalier improvisation that made McDermott\u2019s heart jump and broke open the Broncos game might\u2019ve resembled backyard football when, in truth, it was the direct result of countless scramble drills at practice. (\u201cTrust,\u201d Knox adds, \u201cthey\u2019ve built in practice.\u201d) That\u2019s why Johnson makes an important distinction: Nothing about manifesting is luck. He creates these opportunities.\n\nThat\u2019s been the case his entire life. All the way back to a hometown hit hard by the opioid epidemic. Cumberland, Md., pop. 18,751, has a poverty rate double the national average. Johnson grew up in a single-parent household. Nor were college recruiters banging on the doors of Fort Hill High School back in 2012 and 2013. Hell, probably 99 percent of \u2018em didn\u2019t even know the school existed. Johnson played in the state\u2019s lowest classification, 1A, while splitting carries in a Wing T offense. And considering Fort Hill pulverized teams by an average of 32.6 points his final season, Johnson barely even played in the second half of games. Whenever he did touch the ball, he maximized that opportunity. He averaged 17.6 yards per carry as a junior and nearly as much as a senior.\n\nTo this day, Johnson can picture the spacious South Cumberland Library positioned at 100 Seymour Street, just off Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n\u201cI was always in there,\u201d he says.\n\nProducing on the field alone wouldn\u2019t be enough to play college ball. His head coach at Fort Hill, Todd Appel, is honest. Colleges didn\u2019t care much about a tiny 1A school in Maryland.\n\n\u201cThey turn their nose up to you,\u201d Appel says, \u201cbecause, well, \u2018Who are they playing against?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe coach printed out as many email addresses as he could of college football coaches across the country, fashioned it into a binder and handed it to Johnson. (A \u201chuge-ass binder,\u201d Johnson specifies.) Johnson then took that binder to the local library and did his research on a computer. Coaches are always jumping from school to school, so he wanted to make sure whoever he was emailing was still at that listed school. Then, Johnson wrote a personalized email with a link to his highlight reel. He sent at least 50 emails per day to head coaches, running backs coaches, even DB coaches.\n\nDuring school hours, he couldn\u2019t help himself. He\u2019d get in trouble at math class for sneaking in a few more emails.\n\nThis is the only speed Ty Johnson ever knew. At Fort Hill, the gym was open to the varsity team from 8 a.m. to 9:30, and Appel remembers Johnson sticking around for every second. He was always the last to leave. That young, at age 16 and 17, Johnson wrote down his short- and long-term goals. Everything from the number of reps he wanted to churn out on the bench press to making this D-I dream a reality.\n\n\u201cHis work ethic is unmatched by anybody,\u201d Appel says. \u201cWhen you have the best player on your team work the hardest, you\u2019re going to have a really good football team. And that was Ty.\u201d\n\nOne day, while cutting firewood, a Fort Hill assistant asked Appel if he thought the kid could make the NFL.\n\nIf anybody could, Appel answered, \u201cit\u2019s Ty.\u201d\n\nMost college coaches never replied to those emails. Many asked him to fill out a recruiting questionnaire \u2014 the universal code for \u201cScram, kid!\u201d A select few invited him to their summer camp but, unfortunately, Johnson didn\u2019t have the money to travel around the country. In all, he received two offers. The University of Albany visited, saw Johnson run the 40-yard dash and offered him on the spot. Then, of course, the University of Maryland offered a scholarship. That\u2019s one camp Johnson was able to attend because College Park, Md., was located only 132 miles southeast. Coaches took one look at his wheels and were convinced.\n\nAt Maryland, Johnson played for multiple different coordinators in a part-time role\u2026 but still managed to rush for 1,004 yards as a sophomore on only 110 carries for an preposterous 9.1 average that led the entire nation. He didn\u2019t receive an invite to the NFL Combine\u2026 so he blew up his pro day. He ran a hand-time of 4.26 seconds and benched 225 pounds 27 times to get drafted in the sixth round of the 2019 draft by the Detroit Lions.\n\nOf course, these were not yet Dan Campbell\u2019s Lions. Echoing others, Johnson assures that playing for Matt Patricia was often a cruel experience. Inside the building, Patricia was friendly. Johnson calls him a \u201cgreat person,\u201d adding that the head coach even went out of his way to give players a chance to voice their opinions through an emotionally turbulent 2020. \u201cBut obviously,\u201d Johnson adds, \u201che can motherfuck you. It was rough.\u201d After getting waived by the Lions on Oct. 1, 2020, he remembers watching the Jets and Broncos on Thursday Night Football and thinking he could go to New Jersey. That night, Jets assistant GM Rex Hogan called to say they were claiming him.\n\nHe took his second carry 34 yards against Miami. (\u201cI can do this,\u201d Johnson told himself.)\n\nLater that season, he eclipsed 100 yards vs. the Raiders. His confidence grew. He remembered what one of the all-time greats \u2014 Adrian Peterson \u2014 told him when they were teammates in Detroit: \u201cJust run.\u201d Don\u2019t overthink. Don\u2019t hesitate. Go. The Jets continued to jet. While Johnson doesn\u2019t want to disparage a team that employed him for three seasons, he assures it\u2019s never fun when a team goes 13-37 over three seasons. Nor was getting so unceremoniously cut. It took a long time to build up the mentality he has today in Buffalo.\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn hindsight, Johnson knows how easily he could\u2019ve been puked out by the NFL machine. One bad coach. One freak injury. That\u2019s all it takes to get forgotten forever. Those four months out of work could\u2019ve broken Johnson. Clearly, there was an internal struggle. Dark days. Thing is? Appel never noticed. With his arm in a sling, Johnson still ran his football camp in Cumberland that summer with \u201ca big smile on his face and his hair flopping in the air,\u201d the coach says.\n\nJohnson acted then as if he knew everything would be just fine. He was manifesting.\n\nBy supplying just enough film before that torn pec, Johnson dotted Beane\u2019s radar.\n\n\u201cThe will and the willpower and the want to keep going and knowing that I can be here and play,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cI might not have been getting the ball 100 times. But being able to make the most of every little opportunity, that\u2019s been my whole deal since college.\u201d\n\nWhen Appel visits his friend today in Western New York, he sees those sticky notes all over the mirror. Messages like, Be Great Today and I Can Do This.\n\nHe never hears Johnson utter a negative word. Never hears him get down at all.\n\nForget football. Appel says that he fully expects Johnson to achieve greatness in life.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be uplifted, hang around Ty for a while,\u201d Appel continues. \u201cI think we can all take an example of that. There\u2019s days where we don\u2019t want to go to work. There\u2019s days where there\u2019s something tragic in our life or there\u2019s days when there\u2019s things going wrong and \u2014 if you speak positive existence in your life \u2014 good things are bound to happen and he\u2019s a good role model with that.\u201d\n\nWhich, of course, is everything the Buffalo Bills need right now. Negative thoughts have too often loitered in the psyche of players January games past. The vet Knox, who\u2019s been around for the last five crushing playoff defeats, sees a team sincerely doing its best to treat Sunday as any other game. A welcomed change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to stay loose,\u201d Knox says. \u201cIt\u2019s focusing on stuff that we can control: our playbook and playing free, playing fast and letting our personality shine through. It feels a little more relaxed in a good way this year.\u201d\n\nNo coach, no captain, no guest speaker can merely instruct a group of grown men to quit stressing, to relax. A team must get to this mental state naturally.\n\nThe key has been building trust with the coaches. If a player makes a dynamite play in practice and starts dancing, Knox explains, coaches aren\u2019t saying anything. They know you\u2019ll bring the same juice to gameday. In fact, they\u2019re even encouraging such personality to shine. (\u201cThey\u2019ve got to trust us,\u201d Knox adds. \u201cWe have to have trust in each other.\u201d) Treat a divisional playoff matchup like this too seriously \u2014 allow the magnitude of it all to weigh on your shoulders like a 100-pound boulder \u2014 and the result can be tightness.\n\nKnox witnessed this effect in playoff games past.\n\n\u201cThe longer I\u2019ve been here, the more I\u2019ve seen the progression of everything in this building,\u201d he says. \u201cThat calmness comes with preparation. Knowing that we\u2019re doing the right things day-in and day-out, working on our style of play, our headspace, there\u2019s a lot of confidence that comes in preparation, too. So it\u2019s not pressing or worrying about the opponent or trying to do something extra special this week. It\u2019s just doing what we\u2019ve been doing all year. Focus on us.\u201d\n\nThere are many ways to reach such peace. Knox relies on prayer and absolutely sees the power in Johnson\u2019s manifestation.\n\nSay something out loud again\u2026 again\u2026 and again\u2026 and he believes it can happen.\n\n\u201cPositive self-talk is huge,\u201d Knox adds. \u201cKeeping the anxious thoughts away.\u201d\n\nSo, ready or not, here comes Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and a Ravens team full of their own Super Bowl expectations. As kickoff nears, nerves may heighten. All Johnson needs to do is gaze at those affirmations on the sticky notes and the ink covering his body. Messages are everywhere. In addition to that \u201cManifest\u201d inscribed just above his clavicle, he points to the \u201cGood Vibes Only\u201d Shaka symbol on his ankle. And \u201cMemento Mori,\u201d Latin for \u201cremember you must die.\u201d This reminds Johnson to stay present and live life to the fullest. And \u201cAmor Fati,\u201d Latin for \u201clove of one\u2019s fate.\u201d This keeps him leveled through life\u2019s inevitable ups and downs.\n\nHe hopes to inspire kids in Cumberland. Whenever Johnson has a chance to speak to kids back home, he\u2019s speaks positively\u2026 with a dose of brutal honesty. Manifestation is not a matter of scribbling down a few words, closing your eyes and waiting for greatness to land in your lap like a fourth-and-1 pass from Josh Allen. He bluntly tells kids that nothing will be easy.\n\nThese days, Johnson sees far too many kids bailing the second times get tough.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to put in the damn work,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cLook at the transfer portal \u2014 shit gets hard and people leave. And same thing with high school sports. They\u2019ll just quit and go to another sport. Yeah, you can do it but it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d\n\nThe playoffs have most certainly not been easy for the Buffalo Bills, but they keep dusting themselves off. They keep fighting their way back into this divisional round of the AFC playoffs.\n\nOn this day, it\u2019s relatively quiet inside the locker room. No music is blaring. All you hear is the squishing of flip-flops and a few inaudible conversations at lockers around the corner. Nobody\u2019s battling at the team\u2019s Bubble Hockey machine. Nobody\u2019s playing ping-pong. Two teammates engage in a laidback game of cornhole, then exit. Allen thumbs through his cell phone at his locker for a while, then he exits.\n\nSomeone passing through this room will need to make the play that decides Buffalo\u2019s fate.\n\nConsider it all the calm before the storm. The Bills put the work in. And now \u2014 finally \u2014 maybe they\u2019ve all entered the right mental space to make that play, to win this game.\n\nAfter all, shit, it\u2019s just football.\n\nShare\n\nHey! Let\u2019s hang out this Saturday night at Fattey Beer in Orchard Park, NY. Details:\n\nICYMI:\n\nBills Profiles this season:\n\nBeane Q&A:",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson pays $14.6 billion for mental health biopharma company\n\nby Gus Iversen , Editor in Chief | January 17, 2025\n\nJohnson & Johnson has acquired Intra-Cellular Therapies, a New Jersey-based biopharmaceutical company focused on treatments for central nervous system disorders, in a deal valued at $14.6 billion.\n\n\n\nJ&J will purchase all outstanding shares of Intra-Cellular Therapies at $132 per share in cash, a move that strengthens its neuroscience portfolio and signals its focus on mental health and neurodegenerative conditions.\n\n\n\nThrough the acquisition, J&J gains CAPLYTA (lumateperone), an FDA approved oral therapy for schizophrenia and bipolar I and II depression, both as monotherapy and adjunctive treatment. CAPLYTA is also under review by the FDA for use as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), with the potential to address one of the most common and debilitating mental health conditions.\n\n\n\n\u201cBuilding on our nearly 70-year legacy in neuroscience, this acquisition demonstrates our commitment to advancing care for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders,\u201d said Joaquin Duato, J&J's chairman and CEO.\n\n\n\nIn addition to CAPLYTA, the deal includes ITI-1284, a Phase 2 pipeline candidate being studied for generalized anxiety disorder and Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related psychosis and agitation. J&J also gains access to ongoing clinical trials, including Phase 3 studies investigating CAPLYTA in bipolar mania and schizophrenia relapse prevention.\n\n\n\nIn December 2024, Intra-Cellular Therapies submitted a supplemental new drug application for CAPLYTA as an adjunctive treatment for MDD. Data from two Phase 3 studies demonstrated significant improvement in depressive symptoms with a safety profile consistent with prior trials. If approved, it would be the first MDD treatment in over 15 years to address depressive symptoms associated with both bipolar I and II disorders.\n\n\n\nThe acquisition comes as mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and MDD, affect millions of adults in the U.S., with rising demand for effective therapies. Jennifer Taubert, executive vice president and worldwide chairman of J&J's Innovative Medicine segment, highlighted the opportunity to \u201csignificantly advance care\u201d through the addition of Intra-Cellular\u2019s therapies and expertise.\n\n\n\nThe transaction is expected to close later this year, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. Following the acquisition, Intra-Cellular Therapies will no longer trade on the Nasdaq.",

The top moment came in his maiden season after Perez helped the 4Aces win the league's first-ever Team Championship.\n\nHaving contributed to his team's title win in 2022, Perez returned a year later, before being offered a contract extension for 2024 by Johnson, something the former Tour star was grateful for. Couldn\u2019t be more excited,\u201d Perez said after being handed a contract extension \u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal to remain a part of LIV. I\u2019m very grateful.\"\n\nDespite being offered an extension to stay, Perez failed to take advantage, enduring a difficult campaign throughout 2024. His best finish of the season came when tying for 14th in Nashville last June, and only a late mistake by Kalle Samooja in Chicago in September ensured he was not relegated.\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\nIt remained unknown as to whether Johnson would once again place his trust back in Perez but sent a clear message when signing RangeGoats player Thomas Pieters late last year. Former Ryder Cupper Pieters was added to the 4Aces setup in December, leaving five names on the 4Aces roster.\n\nOf course, only four can compete, and Johnson has opted to leave Perez out for the coming year. Talking up his new signing, the former Masters champion said of Pieters: \"Happy to have Thomas on the team. He\u2019s a great addition, and a great player and makes the team stronger. Really excited for next season.\"\n\nPieters was also welcomed by 4Aces General Manger Chris Rosaasen, who added: \"He\u2019s a solid player with multiple wins in his career. His Ryder Cup record shows he excels in team golf. He\u2019s going to be a great fit for the 4Aces brand both on and off the course.\u201d",

            "content": "Analysts on Wall Street project that Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) will announce quarterly earnings of $2 per share in its forthcoming report, representing a decline of 12.7% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $22.54 billion, increasing 5.4% from the same quarter last year.\n\nOver the past 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged. This demonstrates the covering analysts' collective reassessment of their initial projections during this period.\n\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.\n\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Johnson & Johnson metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Sales- MedTech- Total' should come in at $8.28 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7.9%.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Sales- Innovative Medicine- WW' reaching $14.28 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +4.1% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Sales- MedTech- Orthopaedics- Trauma- WW' will reach $765.83 million. The estimate points to a change of +3.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Sales- MedTech- Orthopaedics- Spine, Sports & Other- WW' to reach $742.98 million. The estimate indicates a change of +0.1% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Sales- Innovative Medicine- Oncology- CARVYKTI- WW' to come in at $330.28 million. The estimate suggests a change of +107.7% year over year.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Sales- Innovative Medicine- Neuroscience- SPRAVATO- WW' of $296.88 million. The estimate suggests a change of +44.1% year over year.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Sales- MedTech- Cardiovascular- ABIOMED- WW' should arrive at $381.54 million. The estimate indicates a change of +12.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Sales- MedTech- Cardiovascular- Other Cardiovascular- WW' at $92.56 million. The estimate points to a change of +4% from the year-ago quarter.",

            "content": "Many investors define successful investing as beating the market average over the long term. But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Johnson & Johnson ( ) shareholders, since the share price is down 13% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 32%. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 12% in the last 90 days.\n\nNow let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring the three years that the share price fell, Johnson & Johnson's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 3.3% each year. The share price decline of 5% is actually steeper than the EPS slippage. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, in the past.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Johnson & Johnson's TSR for the last 3 years was -5.1%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nInvestors in Johnson & Johnson had a tough year, with a total loss of 6.8% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 27%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 2%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Johnson & Johnson better, we need to consider many other factors.

            "content": "The market has been volatile since the start of 2025, as investors fret about the elevated valuations of some of the market\u2019s leaders (particularly the mega-cap tech stocks of the \u2018magnificent seven\u2019) after these stocks fueled massive returns for the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (NDX) over the past two years.\n\nHowever, blue-chip stocks are still trading at surprisingly cheap levels, like healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). I\u2019m bullish on Johnson & Johnson based on its inexpensive valuation, impressive size, and scale, which allow it to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities, dividend yield, and an unassailable dividend track record.\n\nA Diversified Healthcare Giant\n\nFounded 138 years ago and based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest and most diversified healthcare companies. It operates across two business segments, pharmaceutical and medical devices, after spinning off its consumer business, which became Kenvue (KVUE), a $40 billion company, in 2023.\n\nAccording to Morningstar, the pharmaceutical segment makes up about two-thirds of the company\u2019s business, while medical devices account for one-third. No single product or device dominates sales in either segment, so the company features a nice mix of diversification with various revenue streams. As CEO Joaquin Duato said at the JPMorgan (JPM) Healthcare Conference, \u201cWe are not a one-trick pony company; that\u2019s not who we are.\u201d\n\nFlexing Its Muscles\n\nIn addition to its diversified business model, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s immense size and scale allow it to pounce on attractive acquisition opportunities when they arise, which is exactly what it has been doing in recent years.\n\nThe company has flexed its financial muscle in acquiring cutting-edge medical device makers like Shockwave Medical for $13.1 billion in 2024 and Abiomed for $16.6 billion in 2022. At this week\u2019s JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, Johnson & Johnson announced the acquisition of biotech Intra-Cellular Therapies (ICTI) for $14.6 billion. The New York City-based biotech focuses on products for the central nervous system, like Calypta, its treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Intra-Cellular has been posting rising revenue and received a major boost this week when a patent settlement extended patent exclusivity for Calypta from 2036 to 2040. Promisingly, Intra-Cellular is also reportedly in line to earn approval for a potential treatment for major depressive disorder.\n\nAs Duato explained at the conference, \u201c\u2026our broadly diversified model in health care means that we can go where medicine is going and that we can constantly reinvent ourselves as we have done over time.\u201d\n\nValuation Unbecoming of a Blue-Chip Company\n\nAs a widely recognized household name and a longtime member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Johnson & Johnson is a blue-chip company, but you wouldn\u2019t guess that from its valuation.\n\nShares trade for just 13.4 times the consensus 2025 earnings estimates, which is incredibly cheap in today\u2019s market. For comparison, the S&P 500 index trades for a substantially higher average multiple of 24.8 times earnings.\n\nAgainst a market backdrop in which investors have grown concerned about signs of froth in the market and the rich multiples of many top growth stocks, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s undemanding valuation is attractive. This low multiple should offer investors a strong degree of downside protection in the event of a market selloff and also leave ample room for upside.\n\nOn this note, there is also plenty of room for Johnson & Johnson to revert to the mean and join the broader market\u2019s rally. Mega-cap tech stocks raced higher over the past year, spurring a 21.8% gain for the S&P 500 over the past 12 months, but Johnson & Johnson is down 10% over the same time frame. It, therefore, has the potential to catch up with the broader market if and when investors take profits and rotate out of some of the market\u2019s recent winners and into some of its laggards in more defensive sectors like healthcare.\n\nOver Six Decades of Growing Dividend Payments\n\nShares of Johnson & Johnson yield an attractive 3.5% on a forward basis, significantly higher than the S&P 500, which only yields 1.3%.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the high yield that makes Johnson & Johnson an attractive dividend stock. Few companies in the market can match the incredible longevity of its dividend or its long-term track record of dividend growth. The 138-year-old company has been paying dividends to its shareholders for the past 62 years in a row, and it has increased the size of its payout in each of these 62 years.\n\nThis type of steadfast consistency is an attractive feature in a market where few things are certain, so Johnson & Johnson\u2019s reputation as a favorite stock for income investors is well-earned.\n\nIs JNJ Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, JNJ earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, 11 Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst JNJ stock price target of $170.67 implies a 17.73% upside potential from current levels.\n\nSee more JNJ analyst ratings\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nI\u2019m bullish on Johnson & Johnson based on its undemanding valuation, which stands out in a broader market trading at an elevated level; its attractive 3.5% dividend yield; and its long history of dividend growth, which goes back over six decades. I also like how the company has used its enormous scale and financial firepower to aggressively pursue attractive acquisitions to bolster its product portfolio and position itself for long-term growth, culminating in this week\u2019s Intra-Cellular Therapies deal.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company that started in the early 1870s. Robert Wood Johnson began training as a pharmacist at 16 and founded his 1st company in 1873. That company would be disbanded by 1886 when Johnson joined his brothers to form today's entity. The company\u2019s first line of products was sterile surgical dressings which were soon followed up by household products and medical guides.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world\u2019s largest companies. It is ranked 36th on the 2021 Fortune 500 list and is a Dow Jones Industrial Average member. The company operates via 250 subsidiaries with operations in 60 countries and product sales in 175. As of 2021, annual sales were in the range of $95 billion and growing. The company is also a leader in equality and the advancement of women\u2019s rights. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s workforce was nearly 50% female by 1910, and many held significant positions of responsibility.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s many advances in health care is the advancement of sterile conditions to prevent postoperative and secondary infections. Products include sterile gauze, cotton and dressings, and the development of the industrial sterilization process. However, the product that launched the company to success was the combination of a sterile dressing with tape. The company called the new products Band-Aids, which is now synonymous with small, prepackaged bandages. Another major win for the company was Johnson & Johnson Baby Soap.\n\nToday, Johnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Health and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment alone covers brands like Aveeno, Listerine, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Band-Aid and Neosporin, which are among the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cblend science and ingenuity to change the trajectory of health for humanity profoundly\u201d.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment offers products in all segments of the healthcare spectrum and has partnerships to develop new drugs with at least 10 other major healthcare providers and dozens of smaller research facilities. Products are offered wholesale to retailers and through healthcare systems. The MedTech segment develops and manufactures various healthcare devices and diagnostic tools. Among the many recognizable products from this segment are ACUVUE contact lenses.\n\nJohnson & Johnson went public in 1944 and began paying dividends soon after. The company began increasing its dividend payment in 1962 and has increased it yearly. The company is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat Index and qualifies as a Dividend King with more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. The company employs more than 142,000 individuals and serves more than 1 billion daily. Regarding the company\u2019s health, its track record of dividend payments is backed up by a AAA credit rating. Johnson & Johnson is one of only 2 US corporations with such a rating and is more trusted than the US government.\n\nThe company announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2021. The move is expected to be complete in late 2023 and will result in a Consumer Health company and a Pharmaceutical company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Listen to the article 7 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nTwo major deals announced during this week\u2019s J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference added up to the largest M&A turnout in years. How does that brief January flurry compare to previous years?\n\nJohnson & Johnson led the charge with the biggest deal announced during the conference since at least 2018, revealing the pharma giant is in line to buy neuropsychiatric biotech Intra-Cellular Therapies for $14.6 billion. GSK also joined the fray this year with a $1 billion purchase of cancer drugmaker IDRx.\n\nThe M&A rebound has been years in the making as companies like J&J and GSK face a patent cliff that threatens billions in revenue, and they need to pump up their pipelines to adjust to the coming storm, experts have observed.\n\nThe deals this week, while pointing to a general upswing in dealseeking, also paint a picture of companies\u2019 shifting priorities. At J&J, for instance, incoming competition for the immunology standout Stelara has caused the massive company to explore opportunities in neuropsychiatry, where it found recent success with the depression drug Spravato. For GSK, a near-term patent expiration for the HIV drug dolutegravir has led to a deeper dive into the dependably active field of oncology.\n\nHere, we\u2019re stepping backward through J.P. Morgan history to explore the deals that have peppered the meeting since 2018, following the wider life sciences landscape along the way, from a megamerger boom to a pandemic disturbance and potential resurgence on the horizon.\n\n2025 (Jan. 13-16)\n\nFor deals announced during the J.P. Morgan conference, 2025 takes the cake as the largest in recent years. J&J\u2019s $14.6 billion purchase of Intra-Cellular is out of the ordinary for the conference as a more substantial deal rather than the standard bolt-ons, particularly since the pandemic threw uncertainty into the mix.\n\nThe deal gives J&J one more leg up in clinical depression and schizophrenia with the potential blockbuster Caplyta in Intra-Cellular\u2019s commercial portfolio and a pipeline of neuropsychiatric drugs that could build on the pharma giant\u2019s success with the ketamine-based depression drug Spravato.\n\nGSK\u2019s $1 billion IDRx deal is more in line with the usual slate of mergers announced during the conference, bringing in a rare cancer drug with precision medicine capabilities.\n\nAdding to the deal flurry, Eli Lilly acquired a clinical oncology drug candidate from Scorpion Therapeutics for as much as $2.5 billion in milestone payments down the road.\n\n2024 (Jan. 8-11)\n\nLast year, the J.P. Morgan conference boasted four deals between opening and closing, but the total consideration was much lower with less than $4 billion on the line. J&J again held the most prominent position at the table, announcing the $2 billion purchase of cancer drugmaker Ambrx Biopharma on the first day of the meeting. Ambrx provided J&J with multiple antibody-drug conjugate candidates, which is a field that continues to appeal to drugmakers.\n\nThree pharma giants rounded out the other deals, with GSK\u2019s $1 billion up-front purchase of immunology biotech Aiolos Bio, Merck & Co.\u2019s $680 million acquisition of cancer drugmaker Harpoon Therapeutics and Novartis\u2019 $250 million up-front bolt-on of immunology company Calypso.\n\n2023 (Jan. 9-12)\n\nDealmaking was a little more muted in 2023, but a few smaller acquisitions still slid into focus. AstraZeneca\u2019s $1.3 billion up-front purchase of cardiorenal specialist CinCor was the largest of the bunch as the industry slowly emerged from the pandemic-era doldrums. Two smaller deals \u2014 including Ipsen\u2019s rare disease purchase of Albireo and BioNTech\u2019s InstaDeep buy \u2014 brought total consideration to around $2.7 billion during the conference window.\n\n2022 (Jan. 10-13)\n\nZero. Zilch. Nada. There were no deals at all announced during the 2022 J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference, marking a low point in the meeting\u2019s dealmaking reputation. In fact, the only acquisition revealed during that entire month of January was UCB\u2019s purchase of epilepsy drugmaker Zogenix for as much as $1.9 billion with milestones, more than a week after the meeting ended.\n\nOne important note about 2022: The conference was held remotely due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n2021 (Jan. 7-13)\n\nLike many of the years during the pandemic, 2021 was light on deals announced during the conference. Chimerix kicked it off with a small $78 million purchase of cancer drugmaker Oncoceutics, and then Sanofi upped the ante with an acquisition of immunology biotech Kymab worth $1.1 billion up front.\n\n2020 (Jan. 13-16)\n\nThe first year of the decade marked another low point for J.P. Morgan dealmaking with only one announced during the meeting\u2019s window. BioNTech, prior to skyrocketing as Pfizer\u2019s partner with the first approved COVID-19 vaccine, placed a modest $67 million bet on cancer biotech Neon Therapeutics. Today, BioNTech is still pursuing a foothold in oncology with a pipeline of cancer therapies.\n\nA week prior to the meeting, Eli Lilly jumped into the new year with a $1.1 billion acquisition of immunology company Dermira.\n\n2019 (Jan. 7-10)\n\nThe year before the pandemic was a major one for dealmakers. The only acquisition that debuted during the J.P. Morgan conference was Lilly\u2019s $8 billion purchase of cancer drugmaker Loxo Oncology \u2014 substantial on its own and worth some San Francisco chatter \u2014 but the real talk of the meeting was Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s whopping $74 billion megamerger with Celgene, announced before the doors opened. The deal reshaped the industry.\n\n2018 (Jan. 8-11)\n\nWhile there were no deals reported during the J.P. Morgan meeting in 2018, the industry was still busy \u2014 three major acquisitions came down the pike later that month. Two were wrought by growth-hungry Sanofi, which dropped more than $15 billion collectively to purchase rare disease drugmakers Bioverativ and Ablynx in late January. And similarly, prior to its own sale the following year, Celgene brought Juno Therapeutics into the fold for $9 billion. The cell therapies it gained in that acquisition are now important reminders within Bristol Myers\u2019 current portfolio that a successful pharma is built piece by piece.",

'But here's the thing: neither of us were confident singers, so we were just kind of all singing together.

It lasted like three days. And then it was over, the band broke up.'\n\nWWD // Getty Images\n\nAlex Cooper, the host of the hit podcast, then asked how the pair became friends. 'We became friends because we both grew up in L.A. and I had a friend who was friends with her boyfriend and we met at like an In-N-Out parking lot. And then we went to all the same parties in L.A. at like 16, 17, and I'd see her out and about,' Keough added. 'Then I became friends with her boyfriend, so I went to go and see his band play and she was always there and she was the coolest girl.'\n\nThis isn't the first time that Keough has confessed to her previous life as a rockstar. In a recent interview for ELLE UK\u2019s December/January 2024 issue, the actor opened up about her former band with Johnson. \u2018It\u2019s so funny,\u2019 she began. 'People are obsessed with Folky Porn and now I\u2019m thinking that maybe we slept on a massive duo. Folky Porn only covered three songs, over and over. I don\u2019t really remember what they were, but I think they were all folk bands.\u2019\n\nOn the prospect of the band reforming, she added: \u2018We\u2019d make more folk music.\u2019\n\nELLE Collective is a new community of fashion, beauty and culture lovers.

            "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has informed Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, that he will no longer be chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, according to a GOP leadership source and a Republican lawmaker familiar with the matter.\n\nThe lawmaker said Turner told him Wednesday that he would not be staying on as head of the critical panel that conducts oversight of the U.S. intelligence community. The House Intelligence Committee chair is also a member of the so-called \"Gang of Eight\" congressional leaders who receive some of the most sensitive, classified briefings from the intelligence community.\n\nJohnson confirmed the news later Wednesday but downplayed the change as he offered praise for Turner.\n\n\"It's a new Congress. We just need fresh horses in some of these places. But I'm a Mike Turner fan,\" Johnson told reporters in the Capitol. \"He's done a great job. He performed valiantly in a difficult time under difficult circumstances. So I have nothing but positive things to say about my friend and colleague.\"\n\n\"This is not a President Trump decision; this is a House decision,\" the speaker added, referring to speculation that politics may have led to the change. \"And this is no slight whatsoever to our ... outgoing chairman.\"\n\nThe top post on the Intelligence Committee is one of the few positions directly chosen by the speaker of the House at the start of a new Congress. Johnson said he would make an announcement about Turner\u2019s replacement on Thursday.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday night, Turner, a staunch NATO supporter who has aggressively pushed for U.S. aid for Ukraine, said he was \"proud\" of his time serving on and leading the committee. His office said Turner would only be serving on the Armed Services and Oversight and Government Reform committees in the new Congress, meaning he will no longer have a seat on the Intelligence panel.\n\n\u201cUnder my leadership, we restored the integrity of the Committee and returned its mission to its core focus of national security. The threat from our adversaries is real and requires serious deliberations,\" Turner said.\n\n\u201cAs a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have been and will continue to be a strong advocate for the military and our national defense,\" he continued. \"My work to expand missions and capabilities at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base continues. Furthermore, I look forward to welcoming the NATO Parliamentary Assembly to Dayton in the coming months.\u201d\n\nHouse Republican sources said they did not know who Johnson would choose to replace Turner. Some senior Republicans on the panel are Reps. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, Trent Kelly of Mississippi, and Darin LaHood of Illinois.\n\nLast year, Johnson raised eyebrows in the intelligence community and around Capitol Hill when he appointed two Donald Trump loyalists, Reps. Scott Perry, R-Pa., and Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, to the Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe decision to replace Turner stunned lawmakers in both parties given that Turner, a defense hawk, is well-respected on both sides of the aisle. A former mayor of Dayton, Turner belongs to the GOP's Main Street Caucus, which describes its members as \"pragmatic.\" Other lawmakers in the caucus said they were frustrated by Johnson's decision to oust one of their own.\n\nOne member said the move erodes trust and could complicate Republicans' ability to pass Trump's 2025 agenda given the their paper-thin majority.\n\n\"A bunch of Main Street Republicans are disappointed,\" said the member, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. \"This hurts us in the reconciliation process too. Looks like backroom politics and backstabbing.\"\n\nThen-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had tapped Turner to serve as the top Republican on the panel starting in January 2022 after the lawmaker who had that job, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, resigned to lead Trump Media & Technology Group. After Republicans took back the majority that fall, McCarthy kept him on as chairman of the Intelligence committee for the 118th Congress, a term that started January 2023.\n\nWhen McCarthy was ousted and Johnson succeeded him as speaker in October 2023, Johnson decided to keep Turner in place as Intelligence chairman.\n\nNow, after winning his first full term as speaker earlier this month, Johnson appears to be putting his own mark on this position and others. On Tuesday, Johnson appointed Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., the former Education and Workforce Committee chair, as the new Rules Committee chair. And Johnson is keeping Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., in the role of Administration Committee chair.\n\nDemocrats on the Intelligence Committee said they did not get any warning that Turner was being removed.\n\n\"I'm enormously concerned because I think you'd be hard-pressed to find somebody as fair-minded,\" said Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Intelligence panel.\n\nHe added that Turner \"and I had our disagreements, but, you know, I had confidence in him.\"\n\nWith Trump days away from returning to the White House, Democrats have been sounding the alarm that top intelligence and national security posts are being influenced by presidential politics.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Senate Democrats pressed former Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, Trump's pick to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, asking him if he would push back against efforts requiring CIA employees to demonstrate \"loyalty to a political figure above loyalty to country.\u201d\n\nRatcliffe, a former House Intelligence Committee member who served as Trump's director of national intelligence, responded that he would not impose a political litmus test on his employees.\n\n\u201cIf you look at my record and my record as DNI, that never took place. That is never something anyone alleged,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I would never do.\u201d",

Food insecurity can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and obesity. To combat this pertinent issue across the state, Johnson & Johnson proudly supports two initiatives with Rutgers University and Share My Meals to ensure local communities have access to healthy food.\n\nThe New Brunswick Community Farmers\u2019 Market\n\nLaunched in 2009 in partnership with J&J, Rutgers, and the City of New Brunswick, the New Brunswick Community Farmers\u2019 Market brings healthy food from local farms to students and families across the city. At the Rutgers Feeds the Future event this fall, University leadership honored J&J for being a foundational supporter of the market, which has been offering fresh produce, baked goods, ready-to-eat meals, nutrition education, and fun, family-friendly activities throughout the last 15 years.\n\n\u201cAccess to food and health are deeply connected,\u201d said Tommy Lobben, manager of Community Engagement for Johnson & Johnson in New Jersey, who accepted the honor on behalf of the company. \u201cAt Johnson & Johnson, we have a steadfast commitment to supporting our neighbors and surrounding communities in working towards food security. Having greater access to nutritious, safe, and affordable food is key to improving health outcomes and living a healthy life\u2014we will continue to do our part as a corporate citizen to make this a realization for all.\u201d\n\nFrom left, Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway; SEBS Executive Dean Laura Lawson; award recipients Harriet Druskin, Robert Druskin, and Johnson & Johnson Manager of Community Engagement Tommy Lobben; Rutgers New Brunswick\u2013Chancellor Francine Conway; and New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Ed Wengryn. Source: David Michael Howarth\n\nThe Meal Recovery Coalition\n\nSpearheaded by Princeton-based nonprofit Share My Meals, the Meal Recovery Coalition aims to promote the recovery of healthy, surplus meals from large cafeterias and deliver them to food-insecure residents across New Jersey. J&J is proud to be one of the founding members of the coalition, which was officially launched in September 2024 and brings together the private, public and nonprofit sectors to fight food insecurity and the environmental impact of food waste by recovering and delivering healthy meals to local communities.\n\n\u201cIn New Jersey alone, we estimate that 5 million prepared meals end up in landfills annually in the food service sector\u201d, said Helene Lanctuit, CEO of Share My Meals. \u201cThe Meal Recovery Coalition aims to break this cycle by providing a user-friendly, safe way of diverting those meals to support food security in the state and adding them to the other food sources New Jersey is bringing to bear to achieve that goal.\u201d\n\nTo date, the MRC has recovered 100,000 meals, diverting over 295,000 pounds of CO2 equivalent from landfills. The coalition aims to recover 500,000 meals annually by 2026 \u2014 providing food to 6,400 New Jerseyans each week.\n\nBoth the New Brunswick Community Farmers\u2019 Market and the Meal Recovery Coalition demonstrate J&J\u2019s longstanding commitment to fighting hunger and food insecurity in New Jersey. As part of Our Credo, we are committed to helping local communities live healthier lives by supporting better access to the goods they need. From global initiatives to projects here in New Jersey, Johnson & Johnson continues to cultivate key partnerships with local organizations that have the common goal of eradicating hunger.\n\n",

The stock\u2019s last closing price broadly matches JNJ\u2019s value nearly four years ago. However, the company has been rewarding shareholders with regular dividend hikes over the past several years. It currently offers a yield of 3.4%, which is well above the S&P 500 average.\n\nQ4 Report Due\n\nJohnson & Johnson is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, January 22, at 6:20 am ET. Wall Street analysts have forecast a 5% increase in revenues to $22.45 billion in Q4. However, the company\u2019s adjusted profit is expected to decline to $2.04 per share in the final months of the fiscal year from $2.29 per share in Q4 2023.\n\nFrom Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Q3 2024 earnings call:\n\n\u201cOur performance once again reflects the unique breadth of our business and our commitment to delivering the next wave of healthcare innovation to patients around the world. It also reflects the work we have done to shift our pipeline and portfolio to high-innovation and high-growth markets. That work continues, which you saw with the recently completed acquisitions of Shockwave and V-Wave in med tech and Ambrx, Proteologix, and the NM26 bispecific antibody in innovative medicine.\u201d\n\nLast year, stable sales performance in the US and Europe outweighed weakness in Asian markets like China and Japan amid the economic slowdown. At the same time, healthy cash flows have enabled the drugmaker to increase research and development expenses, spending $5 billion in the third quarter alone. However, ongoing legal disputes over product safety and related settlements will remain a drag on the company\u2019s finances in the near future.\n\nResults Beat\n\nJohnson & Johnson has consistently beaten Wall Street\u2019s quarterly earnings estimates for over a decade. In the most recent quarter, both revenue and profit topped expectations. Third-quarter sales rose 5% annually to $22.5 billion, with the Innovative Medicine and MedTech business segments growing 5% and 6% respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, adjusted earnings decreased by 9% year-over-year to $2.42 per share. For the whole of FY24, the company expects sales to be in the range of $88.4 billion to $88.8 billion, and adjusted earnings between $9.88 per share and $9.98 per share. On a reported basis, net income declined in double digits to $2.7 billion or $1.11 per share.\n\nIn Growth Mode\n\nThis week, the company announced the acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for central nervous system disorders, for around $14.6 billion. The deal follows a series of acquisitions the company carried out recently, including heart device maker Shockwave Medical and V-Wave, which develops treatments for heart failure.\n\nJNJ has been languishing below its 52-week average price for more than a month.

This submission is being reviewed by the FDA through the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program, which allows the FDA to review data before the complete application is formally submitted and helps ensure treatments are available for patients as soon as possible.\n\n\"Upon approval, TAR-200 promises to be a meaningful additional treatment option for certain patients with NMIBC, addressing a critical need for people who have had relatively limited therapeutic alternatives. Many patients face life-altering surgical options such as radical cystectomy, which is complete bladder removal,\" said Yusri Elsayed, M.D., M.H.Sc., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Head, Oncology, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. \"By combining our expertise in innovative medicine and medical devices, Johnson & Johnson is uniquely positioned to transform how we treat certain types of bladder cancer through the first and only intravesical drug releasing system for this disease. We look forward to working with the FDA in review of this application.\"\n\nThe submission of this innovative intravesical drug releasing system is supported by data from the Phase 2b SunRISe-1 registration study. Data collected through the second quarter of 2024 and presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2024 Congress as a late-breaking oral presentation showed an 83.5 percent complete response (CR) rate and highly durable CRs without the need for reinduction \u2013 at a median follow-up of nine months, 82 percent of responders maintained response. At data cutoff in May 2024, safety and tolerability data presented at ESMO demonstrated a low occurrence of Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) (9 percent); five patients had TRAEs leading to discontinuation (6 percent) and no treatment-related deaths were reported.1\n\nTAR-200 is an investigational intravesical drug releasing system designed to provide sustained local delivery of gemcitabine into the bladder. It is placed into the bladder by a healthcare professional using a co-packaged urinary placement catheter in an outpatient setting in under five minutes and without the need for anesthesia.\n\nIn December 2023, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) to TAR-200 for the treatment of adult patients with BCG-unresponsive HR-NMIBC with CIS who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo radical cystectomy.\n\nAbout SunRISe-1, Cohort 2\n\nSunRISe-1 (NCT04640623), Cohort 2, is a randomized, parallel-assignment, open-label Phase 2b clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of TAR-200 monotherapy alone for BCG-unresponsive HR-NMIBC carcinoma in situ (CIS) patients who are ineligible for, or elected not to undergo, radical cystectomy. The primary endpoint for Cohort 2 is CR rate at any time point. Secondary endpoints include duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), pharmacokinetics, quality of life, safety and tolerability.\n\nAbout High-Risk Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer\n\nHigh-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC) is a type of non-invasive bladder cancer that is more likely to recur or spread beyond the lining of the bladder, called the urothelium, and progress to invasive bladder cancer compared to low-risk NMIBC.2, 3 HR-NMIBC makes up 15-44 percent of patients with NMIBC and is characterized by a high-grade, large tumor size, presence of multiple tumors, and CIS. Radical cystectomy is currently recommended for NMIBC patients who fail BCG therapy, with over 90 percent cancer-specific survival if performed before muscle-invasive progression.4, 5 Given that NMIBC typically affects older patients, many may be unwilling or unfit to undergo radical cystectomy.6 The high rates of recurrence and progression can pose significant morbidity and distress for these patients.2, 5\n\nAbout Johnson & Johnson\n\nAt Johnson & Johnson, we believe health is everything.

We\u2019re highlighting a few here, but for the rest check out our reporters\u2019 coverage from San Francisco here and here. Also below are news from Johnson & Johnson and Lykos Therapeutics.\n\nJohnson & Johnson on Wednesday said it has begun submitting TAR-200, a drug-device combination developed for bladder cancer, to the Food and Drug Administration under a \"real-time\" review program. Specifically, J&J is seeking clearance of TAR-200 for people with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer that's considered high risk and unresponsive to treatment with the Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine. The treatment, which provides sustained delivery of the chemotherapy gemcitabine into the bladder, is a top prospect for J&J, which has forecast billions of dollars of sales if approved. \"We think is going to be a game change in the treatment of bladder cancer,\" J&J CEO Joaquin Duato told investors at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference Monday. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nLykos Therapeutics, a psychedelics developer that\u2019s been trying to get MDMA approved as a therapy aid for PTSD, announced on Wednesday changes to its board of directors. A total of four board members are now leaving, including chair Jeff George. A fifth, Gisselle Acevedo, stepped down last month. The Food and Drug Administration dealt a major blow to Lykos last summer by rejecting its approval application. Soon after, the company laid off 75% of its staff and saw the departure of CEO and founder Amy Emerson. The Financial Times reported earlier this month that Antonio Gracias, an early Tesla backer and ally of Elon Musk, has in recent weeks sought to take a controlling stake in Lykos. \u2014 Jacob Bell\n\nFourth quarter sales of Elevidys, Sarepta Therapeutics' gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, came in ahead of both Wall Street expectations and the company's guidance, totaling some $384 million. Full year revenue from the treatment was $820 million, Sarepta said Monday. While sales were strong to end 2024, Sarepta did not change its guidance for this year and continues to predict between revenue of $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion across its entire business. \"The current guidance puts Sarepta in a position of strength for potential beats in the coming year of earnings,\" wrote Baird analyst Brian Skorney in a Tuesday note to clients. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nEye health company Bausch + Lomb has acquired Irvine, California-based Whitecap Biosciences, gaining access to two drugs in testing for glaucoma and geography atrophy. Founded in 2015, Whitecap recently completed a Phase 2 study for its glaucoma treatment and has further testing planned in geographic atrophy, which can lead to vision loss. No price was disclosed.\u2014 Delilah Alvarado\n\nMadrigal Pharmaceuticals on Monday said net sales of its MASH drug Rezdiffra totaled between $177 million and $180 million in 2024. Approved in March for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, Rezdiffra has launched strongly in the U.S. Fourth quarter net sales of $100 million to $103 million were higher than the sell-side consensus figure of $91.5 million, per Leerink Partners, and nearly 12,000 people are now taking the therapy. \u201cWe expect [Madrigal] will continue building the [M]ASH market via increased prescriber penetration and [M]ASH patient uptake,\u201d Thomas J. Smith wrote in a Monday note to clients. Madrigal expects a \u201ccountry-by-country launch\u201d in Europe in the second half of 2025, should EU regulators sign off on the medicine. \u201cOverall, we think Rezdiffra's launch continues to look encouraging given revenues are 10-13% higher than sell side [consensus],\u201d Akash Tewari wrote in a Jefferies note to clients. \u2014 Delilah Alvarado",

(Credit: Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc.)\n\nJohnson & Johnson (J&J) has reached an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of biopharmaceutical company Intra-Cellular Therapies for a total equity value of approximately $14.6bn in cash.\n\nIntra-Cellular Therapies focus on developing treatments for central nervous system (CNS) disorders.\n\nWith this acquisition, Johnson & Johnson gains Intra-Cellular Therapies\u2019 Caplyta (lumateperone), an oral treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar depression.\n\nCaplyta is said to enhance Johnson & Johnson\u2019s portfolio with $5bn+ peak sales potential, driving sales growth above analyst expectations through the decade.\n\nThe deal also includes ITI-1284, a Phase 2 compound in development for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and Alzheimer\u2019s-related psychosis and agitation.\n\nAdditionally, J&J gained access to a clinical-stage pipeline that further complements and supports its current therapeutic focus.\n\nIn December last year, the biopharmaceutical company submitted a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Caplyta as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD).\n\nIn Phase 3 studies, Caplyta showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms when added to antidepressants.\n\nIf approved, the drug could be the first treatment for MDD and bipolar depression in over 15 years. Additional Phase 3 trials are ongoing for bipolar mania and relapse prevention in schizophrenia.\n\nIn November 2024, the biopharmaceutical company announced positive results from Phase 3 Study 304 of Caplyta for the treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia.\n\nJohnson & Johnson chairman and CEO Joaquin Duato said: \u201cBuilding on our nearly 70-year legacy in neuroscience, this unique opportunity to add Intra-Cellular Therapies to our Innovative Medicine business demonstrates our commitment to transforming care and advancing research in some of today\u2019s most devastating neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.\u201d\n\nUnder the agreement, Johnson & Johnson will acquire all outstanding shares of Intra-Cellular Therapies for $132 per share in cash. The transaction will be funded through a mix of cash and debt.\n\nThe deal is expected to close later this year, pending regulatory approvals and stockholder consent. Once completed, Intra-Cellular Therapies\u2019 stock will no longer be traded on the Nasdaq.\n\nIntra-Cellular Therapies Chairman and CEO Sharon Mates said: \u201cCaplyta\u2019s success and the robust pipeline we have built demonstrates the passion and dedication of our talented team, and we are proud of the hundreds of thousands of patients we have helped.\u201d",

            "content": "During its presentation at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference 2025, Johnson and Johnson (J&J) suggested it would undertake an aggressive strategic approach in the immunology space for the coming year. While speaking at the conference, J&J\u2019s CEO, Joaquin Duato, indicated the company\u2019s willingness to protect Stelara, its branded anti-interleukin (IL)-12/23 biologic, against sales erosion from the pending launches of less expensive biosimilars. The company expects an erosion curve similar to the relatively slow loss of market share and revenue shown by AbbVie\u2019s branded blockbuster adalimumab therapy, Humira.\n\nThe launch of cheaper adalimumab biosimilars in the US market in early 2023 did not result in the expected precipitous fall in Humira\u2019s revenue or market share size. AbbVie\u2019s ability to sustain its position and delay its loss of the adalimumab market was attributed to its rebate programmes for patients and delays in the adoption of competitors\u2019 adalimumab biosimilars by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). J&J\u2019s suggestion of similar aggressive positioning for Stelara may be representative of the company\u2019s overall strategy in the immunology space.\n\nVigorous protection of Stelara\u2019s position in the immunology market aligns with a strategy to grow in the space. During the presentation, Duato also indicated the company\u2019s excitement for the anticipated growth of Tremfya in the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) market, with 2024\u2019s approval of the anti-IL-23 biologic in ulcerative colitis and an expected approval of the therapy for Crohn\u2019s disease. Duato also mentioned that the company views the future entrance of its orally administered IL-23 asset in development, JNJ-2113, as a significant market disruptor. J&J\u2019s aggressive position with Stelara may be seen as a stop-gap against the growth of IL-12/23 biosimilars, allowing an opportunity for Tremfya to take ground in the immunology space, as well as making way for the launch of the oral candidate.\n\nDuato also highlighted JNJ-2113\u2019s oral route of administration as a favourable option for patients over intravenous or subcutaneous biologics. His reference to the therapy as having similar efficacy to current biologics implies that the drug will be positioned as a viable and preferable option for patients in the anti-IL-23 space, but not as a more efficacious new therapy.",

J&J\u2019s two previous Chapter 11 attempts led to dismissals in New Jersey.\n\nIt now aims to have its $8.2 billion payout plan approved later this month with the purported support of 83% of tort claimants.\n\nThe US Trustee on Tuesday also objected to the committee hiring Susman Godfrey LLP as special litigation counsel, calling its employment \u201cexcessive and unnecessary at this stage of the case,\u201d the US Trustee said.\n\nMoney Owed\n\nPaul Hastings previously represented a creditor group in J&J\u2019s second bankruptcy attempt in New Jersey, the US Trustee said. An exact tally of what the firm is owed isn\u2019t yet available, but Paul Hastings is seeking court permission to collect more than $2 million from that bankruptcy, the US Trustee said.\n\nEither Red River or J&J is on the hook to pay that debt, making Paul Hastings a Red River creditor, the US Trustee said.\n\nIn addition, Brown Rudnick has disclosed it\u2019s owed about $3.5 million for its work for another group representing talc claimants, the US Trustee said.\n\nBrown Rudnick has for years represented plaintiffs\u2019 groups opposed to J&J\u2019s use of the bankruptcy system to address talc liabilities. It was tapped in November to serve as co-counsel to the official committee via a deal between competing claimant groups.

The move is aimed at bolstering J&J\u2019s presence in the lucrative brain disease treatment market, according to Reuters.\n\nThe acquisition comes as J&J continues to reshape its business following the spin-off of its consumer health unit in 2023. Over the past few years, the company has made strategic investments to strengthen its pharmaceutical and medical device divisions. Notably, J&J struck a $13.1 billion deal to purchase Shockwave Medical in 2024, demonstrating its commitment to expanding its healthcare portfolio.\n\nSpeaking at a prominent industry conference in San Francisco, J&J CEO Joaquin Duato highlighted the significance of this latest move. \u201cThese deals do not happen every day, and as a matter of fact, for us, larger deals are more outliers,\u201d he said, per Reuters.\n\nIntra-Cellular Therapies is best known for its oral drug Caplyta, which is approved in the U.S. to treat schizophrenia and bipolar depression. The acquisition will provide J&J with immediate access to the drug, as well as several experimental treatments currently in development. Caplyta generated $481.3 million in sales in the first nine months of 2024, with analysts predicting that annual sales could surpass $1 billion next year. Furthermore, the drug is not expected to face generic competition until 2040, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nJ&J\u2019s offer to buy Intra-Cellular Therapies includes a payment of $132 per share, representing a 39% premium over the stock\u2019s closing price on Friday. Following the announcement, Intra-Cellular shares jumped 34% to $128 in afternoon trading, while J&J\u2019s stock rose by 1.5%.\n\nThe acquisition is part of a broader trend in the pharmaceutical sector, with experts predicting increased dealmaking in 2025. Bankers attending the San Francisco conference believe the industry could see more than $10 billion in transactions this year, driven by expectations of reduced antitrust scrutiny after President-elect Donald Trump assumes office on January 20, according to Reuters.\n\nSource: Reuters",

            "content": "The jury in a mesothelioma case against Johnson & Johnson attempted to award plaintiff Michelle Felton $22 million even though J&J won the case. Jessica Dean, Felton\u2019s attorney, said she had never seen a jury award damages on an issue not meant to be considered before.\n\nMichelle Felton is executor of the estate of Michaeleen Lee who died of mesothelioma. Lee used J&J\u2019s talcum powder for decades. The suit alleged the talc was contaminated with asbestos.\n\nWhile J&J achieved a victory in the case, the jury members indicated on their verdict slip that there was negligence on the company\u2019s part. When asked \u201cWere any of the following entities negligent?\u201d the jury checked \u201cyes\u201dfor J&J.\n\nWhen asked, \u201cWas the negligence of any entity below a factual cause of any harm to Michaeleen Lee?\u201d the jury checked \u201cno.\u201d The jury also didn\u2019t fill out the \u201cpercentage of fault\u201d for \u201cfactually causing harm to Michaeleen Lee.\u201d\n\nThe jury did answer \u201cyes\u201d to question 6, however. It asks if the deceased relied \u201con any statement made by Johnson & Johnson, to conceal or omit material information about the safety of the product at issue as proven by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d\n\nThe jury didn\u2019t feel J&J\u2019s \u201cnegligence\u201d was \u201ca factual cause of any harm to Michaeleen Lee.\u201d But they did respond \u201cyes\u201d when asked if \u201cJohnson & Johnson\u2019s conduct in this case warrants a finding of Punitive Damages.\u201d\n\nThe verdict slip concludes with question 10 that asks the amount of punitive damages they recommend be awarded to the plaintiff. The jury members wrote in \u201c$22 million.\u201d But because they\u2019d found in favor of J&J on the issue of factual harm, the jury wasn\u2019t meant to fill in question 10.\n\nWhat Does the Jury\u2019s Decision Mean?\n\nThe plaintiff and her attorney are reportedly considering what\u2019s next following this unusual outcome. A post-trial challenge could be possible.\n\nJ&J\u2019s Worldwide Vice President of Litigation Erik Haas released a statement expressing pleasure with the verdict. Haas claimed allegations J&J\u2019s baby powder was asbestos-contaminated and caused cancer are \u201cbaseless,\u201d \u201cjunk science\u201d and \u201cpaid-for science fomented and financed by plaintiffs\u2019 firms.\u201d\n\nTechnically J&J did win the case. However, the jury members indicated in their verdict slip that they believe the company was negligent and intentionally misrepresented the safety of its talc products.\n\nSettlement Decision for Other J&J Talc Cases Expected Soon\n\nA judge will soon decide if J&J\u2019s $8.2 billion offer to settle thousands of ovarian cancer lawsuits will be approved. Any remaining mesothelioma lawsuits will be addressed separately.\n\nApproval of the settlement includes a third J&J attempt to file for bankruptcy protection. The company\u2019s bankruptcy hearing is set for February 18, 2025.\n\nThe plan is for a J&J subsidiary to file Chapter 11 and take on the company\u2019s legal liabilities. This strategy is known as the Texas Two-Step.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren is challenging this strategy, sponsoring the Nondebtor Release Prohibition Act of 2024. If passed, this legislation would prevent nonbankrupt entities from using bankruptcy to avoid legal liability.\n\nTalc Contamination and FDA Proposed Rule\n\nMany lawsuits against J&J claim asbestos exposure from contaminated talc caused cancer. Both asbestos and talc are naturally occurring minerals. Asbestos can easily contaminate talc.\n\nFor decades, companies used talc in cosmetics, industrial products and personal hygiene products. Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder was talc-based in the U.S. until 2020 and globally until 2023.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposes new tests on all talc-containing products. The FDA\u2019s proposal follows years of talc lawsuits.\n\nApproval of the new checks would force manufacturers to test samples of all talc products using polarized light and transmission electron microscopy. The FDA accepts public comments on the proposed rule until March 27, 2025.\n\nAsbestos is the primary cause of mesothelioma. It can also cause other asbestos-related diseases, including lung cancer, laryngeal cancer, asbestosis and COPD.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +0.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson & Johnson falls in, has lost 3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Johnson & Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2 per share, indicating a change of -12.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.94 points to a change of +0.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.55 indicates a change of +6.1% from what Johnson & Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Johnson & Johnson.",

(Nasdaq: ITCI) announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Johnson & Johnson will acquire all outstanding shares of Intra-Cellular Therapies, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, for $132.00 per share in cash for a total equity value of approximately $14.6 billion.\n\n\u201cBuilding on our nearly 70-year legacy in neuroscience, this unique opportunity to add Intra-Cellular Therapies to our Innovative Medicine business demonstrates our commitment to transforming care and advancing research in some of today\u2019s most devastating neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders,\u201d said Joaquin Duato, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & Johnson. \u201cThis acquisition further differentiates our portfolio, serves as a strategic near- and long-term growth catalyst for Johnson & Johnson and offers compelling value to patients, health systems and shareholders.\u201d\n\nWith this agreement, Johnson & Johnson adds Intra-Cellular Therapies\u2019 CAPLYTA\u00ae (lumateperone), a once-daily oral therapy approved to treat adults with schizophrenia, as well as depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder (bipolar depression), as a monotherapy and adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. The acquisition also includes ITI-1284, a promising Phase 2 compound being studied in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related psychosis and agitation, as well as a clinical-stage pipeline that further complements and strengthens Johnson & Johnson\u2019s current areas of focus.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to welcome Intra-Cellular Therapies\u2019 talented people and world-class expertise to Johnson & Johnson,\u201d said Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson. \u201cTogether, we have an opportunity to impact even more patients living with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, significantly advancing care and helping improve the lives of millions worldwide.\u201d\n\n\u201cCAPLYTA\u00ae\u2019s success and the robust pipeline we have built demonstrates the passion and dedication of our talented team, and we are proud of the hundreds of thousands of patients we have helped,\u201d said Dr. Sharon Mates, Chairman and CEO of Intra-Cellular Therapies. \u201cJohnson & Johnson has a longstanding commitment to neuroscience, and we believe together, we can reach even more patients around the world.\u201d\n\nIn December 2024, Intra-Cellular Therapies announced the submission of a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for CAPLYTA\u00ae as an adjunctive treatment for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). In two global, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, CAPLYTA\u00ae, as an adjunctive treatment to antidepressants, demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in depressive symptoms, as measured by both clinician-rated and patient-reported outcomes. The safety profile of CAPLYTA\u00ae in both studies was consistent with the existing body of clinical data for CAPLYTA\u00ae, and no new safety concerns were identified. If approved, CAPLYTA\u00ae has the potential to be the first treatment approved for MDD and depressive symptoms associated with bipolar I and II in more than 15 years. Additional Phase 3 trials are underway with CAPLYTA\u00ae in bipolar I disorder with manic episodes or manic episodes with mixed features (bipolar mania). Positive topline results evaluating the efficacy and safety of CAPLYTA\u00ae for the prevention of relapse in adult patients with schizophrenia were shared in November 2024.\n\nWhile its exact mechanism of action is unknown, CAPLYTA\u00ae is uniquely characterized by high serotonin 5-HT2A receptor occupancy and lower amounts of dopamine D2 receptor occupancy at therapeutic doses. In short-term clinical studies across all three approved indications, CAPLYTA\u00ae was similar to placebo in weight change, metabolic effects, and extrapyramidal symptoms, which are often cited as reasons for treatment discontinuation. The most common reported adverse events were somnolence/sedation, dizziness, nausea, and dry mouth. Across all three approved indications, CAPLYTA\u00ae can be taken at any time of day with or without food and does not require titration, allowing adult patients to start treatment at the effective dose.\n\n\u201cCAPLYTA\u00ae has robust efficacy, proven safety and favorable tolerability across all three approved indications, without the need for dose titration frequently associated with this class of therapies,\u201d said John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President, R&D, Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson. \u201cWith positive Phase 3 data in MDD as an adjunctive therapy and additional Phase 3 trials in other mental health disorders underway, we believe CAPLYTA\u00ae has the potential to become a new standard of care for the treatment of some of today\u2019s most prevalent and debilitating mental health disorders.\u201d\n\nAs the mental health crisis surges and the global population ages, more than one billion people worldwide \u2013 or 1 in every 8 people \u2013 are living with a neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative disorder. In the United States:\n\nAbout 2.4 million adults live with schizophrenia, a serious, chronic mental illness that causes distortions in thinking, perceptions, emotions, and behavior; ii,iii,iv\n\nApproximately 6.1 million adults live with bipolar disorder, a chronic, lifelong illness that causes dramatic shifts in a person\u2019s mood, energy, and ability to think clearly, making it difficult for patients to carry out daily activities; v,vi\n\nAn estimated 21 million adults live with MDD, one of the most common psychiatric disorders and a leading cause of disability; vii\n\nAbout 6.8 million adults live with GAD, a mental and behavioral disorder that causes excessive and uncontrollable worry and fear; v and,\n\nand, Approximately 6 million adults live with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, a neurodegenerative brain disorder that causes progressive memory loss and a decline in cognitive abilities severe enough to significantly interfere with daily life.viii\n\nTransaction Details and Path to Completion\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Johnson & Johnson will acquire all outstanding shares of Intra-Cellular Therapies for a payment of $132.00 per share in cash. Johnson & Johnson expects to fund the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt. Johnson & Johnson expects to maintain a strong balance sheet and to continue to support its stated capital allocation priorities of R&D investment, competitive dividends, value-creating acquisitions, and strategic share repurchases.\n\nThe closing of the transaction is expected to occur later this year subject to applicable regulatory approvals, approval by Intra-Cellular Therapies\u2019 stockholders and other customary closing conditions for a transaction of this type. Following completion of the transaction, Intra-Cellular Therapies\u2019 common stock will no longer be listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\n\nJohnson & Johnson will provide commentary on any potential impact to Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from the transaction when it provides its initial full year 2025 guidance during the fourth quarter earnings call on Wednesday, January 22, 2025.\n\nAdvisors\n\nCiti is serving as financial advisor to Johnson & Johnson, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore is serving as legal advisor. Centerview Partners LLC and Jefferies are serving as financial advisors to Intra-Cellular Therapies, and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP is serving as legal advisor.\n\nIndication\n\nCAPLYTA\u00ae (lumateperone) is indicated in adults for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder (bipolar depression) as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate.\n\nBoxed Warnings:\n\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson on Monday said it has agreed to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies, a developer of drugs for diseases of the brain, for $132 per share, or about $14.6 billion.\n\nThe announcement of the deal, which if completed would be the largest acquisition of a biotechnology company since early 2023, came on the first day of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, an industry meeting that\u2019s known for dealmaking.\n\nThe chief prize in buying Intra-Cellular is a medicine known as Caplyta that\u2019s approved in the U.S. to treat schizophrenia and bipolar depression. The biotech recently asked the Food and Drug Administration to expand Caplyta\u2019s clearance to include major depressive disorder, which affects about 10 times as many people as have schizophrenia and a little more than three times as many as have bipolar depression.\n\nPartly based on that prospect of an expanded market, Intra-Cellular recently told investors it thinks Caplyta could reach $5 billion in annual sales over the next decade.\n\nIn a statement, J&J CEO Joaquin Duato said the deal builds on his company's \"nearly 70-year legacy\" in neuroscience and shows its \"commitment to transforming care and advancing research in some of today\u2019s most devastating neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.\"\n\nJ&J maintained its investment in neuroscience during the last decade, even as many of its large pharma company peers retreated from the field. The company sells several formulations of Invega, an antipsychotic medicine used for schizophrenia, and in 2019 won U.S. approval for Spravato, a derivative of ketamine that\u2019s cleared for treatment-resistant depression.\n\nTo Graig Suvannavejh, an analyst at the investment firm Mizuho Securities who covers Intra-Cellular, the proposed deal makes strategic sense given that J&J has an existing focus on brain drugs and sales from its neuroscience portfolio have recently stagnated. There, the pharma giant recorded $5.34 billion over the first nine months of 2024, about even compared to the same period a year prior.\n\nIn keeping with industry trends, though, J&J has over the past few years funneled most of the money it spent on M&A toward cancer and immune system drugs, as well as to bolster its medical device division.\n\nThat pattern is now changing as new drugs like Caplyta prove their worth in psychiatric disorders. At the end of 2023, Bristol Myers Squibb agreed to pay $14 billion for Karuna Therapeutics to gain an experimental schizophrenia treatment, while AbbVie bought Cerevel Therapeutics for a similar medicine. (Data disclosed in November, however, showed Cerevel\u2019s medicine didn\u2019t succeed in a pair of clinical trials.)\n\n\u201cCaplyta\u2019s success and the robust pipeline we have built demonstrates the passion and dedication of our talented team, and we are proud of the hundreds of thousands of patients we have helped,\u201d said Sharon Mates, CEO of Intra-Cellular Therapies, in the companies\u2019 statement.\n\nThe $132 per Intra-Cellular share J&J has agreed to pay represents a roughly 40% premium to the biotech\u2019s closing stock price on Friday. It\u2019s an even richer offer compared to Thursday\u2019s close, before Intra-Cellular announced a settlement with Sandoz that could prevent the generic drugmaker from launching a Caplyta copy until July 2040. Other patent litigation related to Caplyta remains pending.\n\nPaul Matteis, an analyst at Stifel, sees J&J's offer as a \"much-needed win for the neuroscience space\" following recent failures of drugs from AbbVie, Alector, Alto Neuroscience and Neumora Therapeutics. The deal is the fourth multibillion-dollar acquisition of a brain drug developer in the last year or so. For Matteis, these transactions affirm the large market opportunities for diseases like schizophrenia, depression and epilepsy, \"even in the presence of many old generics.\"\n\nIn a note to clients, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams wrote that J&J's proposed price for Intra-Cellular shares is \"not unreasonable.\" Though it could leave \"a little bit of room for a higher bid,\" Abrahams and his team don't think that's likely \"given how much of a natural fit\" Caplyta is for J&J's portfolio.\n\nKnown scientifically as lumateperone, Caplyta works by regulating dopamine, though in a different way than other mood-stabilizing medicines. Its success in a notoriously difficult treatment area led some analysts to expect deal interest for Intra-Cellular well before J&J ever made a proposal.\n\n\"I think great companies, they\u2019re bought, they\u2019re not sold. We\u2019re spending our time building our company,\" Mates told BioPharma Dive late last year. \"However, we always entertain inbound offers, and that includes different kinds of partnerships, different strategic options. We look at all of them, and we\u2019ll continue to do so.\"\n\nAlong with Caplyta, J&J would also gain ITI-1284, a drug in Phase 2 testing for generalized anxiety disorder as well as psychosis and agitation related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The additions will pad J&J\u2019s neuroscience pipeline, which includes two closely watched depression drugs, seltotrexant and aticaprant.\n\nJ&J intends to fund the acquisition through cash on hand and debt. The companies expect to close the deal later this year.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated with additional detail and analyst commentary.",

Caplyta is also poised for a label expansion, with a supplemental New Drug Application filed in December 2024 proposing the drug\u2019s use in major depressive disorder as an adjunct to antidepressants.\n\n\u201cCAPLYTA\u00ae\u2019s success and the robust pipeline we have built demonstrates the passion and dedication of our talented team, and we are proud of the hundreds of thousands of patients we have helped,\u201d Intra-Cellular CEO Sharon Mates said in the release. \u201cJohnson & Johnson has a longstanding commitment to neuroscience, and we believe together, we can reach even more patients around the world.\u201d\n\nJ&J will also win ownership over the Phase II ITI-1284, which is being developed for generalized anxiety disorder and Alzheimer\u2019s disease agitation and psychosis. The pharma will likewise get Intra-Cellular\u2019s clinical pipeline, which includes several neuro assets being tested for Parkinson\u2019s disease, pain, opioid use disorder and mood disorders.\n\nAccording to Monday\u2019s news release, Intra-Cellular\u2019s portfolio \u201cfurther complements and strengthens\u201d J&J\u2019s current neuroscience business, anchored by the antipsychotic Invega franchise and the antidepressant nasal spray Spravato. In May 2024, the pharma also reported that its investigational major depressive disorder drug seltorexant aced the Phase III MDD3001 study, leading to significant and meaningful improvements in depressive symptoms and sleep.\n\nNot all has been well for J&J\u2019s neuro unit, however, with the company in October 2024 scrapping several programs in this field, including seltorexant in Alzheimer\u2019s agitation and aggression, as well as the early-stage JNJ-0376 being tested for Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nEditor\u2019s note (Jan. 13): This story has been updated to include comments from Intra-Cellular Therapies CEO Sharon Mates.",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) kicked off the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Monday with the $14.6 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI).\n\nThe news confirms a recent whirlwind of reports suggesting J&J could take out the neuropsych-focused biotech company. Shares of Intra-Cellular skyrocketed 34.1% to 127.19, while J&J stock rose 1.7% to 144.47. The deal values the biotech stock at $132 per share, representing a 39% premium to last week's closing price.\n\nIntra-Cellular is well-established in the schizophrenia and bipolar disease space with its drug, Caplyta. Further, Caplyta has shown promise as a treatment for depression and, last week, the company settled a patent dispute that delays a generic rival until 2040.\n\n\"JNJ had been widely viewed by many as the most likely acquirer for ITCI given the complementarity but not necessarily completely directly overlaps, and an expected more flexible FTC (Federal Trade Commission) could potentially be more amenable to that level of overlap,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report.\n\nJ&J Deepens Its Biopharma Portfolio\n\nThe deal makes sense given that Johnson & Johnson has several products in the neuropsychiatry space, RBC's Abrahams said. J&J sells Invega Sustenna, an antipsychotic that treats schizophrenia, and a depression treatment called Spravato. J&J is also developing a depression-treating pill.\n\nFurther, Intra-Cellular Therapies has done a good job against bigger rival AbbVie in reaching patients with schizophrenia. But Caplyta's potential approval in depression treatment will likely require a bigger commercial presence, Abrahams said.\n\n\"Today's $14.6B acquisition of ITCI by JNJ makes a lot of sense to us, with lead drug Caplyta, which is already approved and selling well in schizophrenia and BPD, likely on its way to getting expanded into MDD, and well on its way to a ~$3.5B (opportunity) already \u2014 and in the hands of a larger partner like JNJ with preexisting experience and commercial presence in neuropsych, potentially to $5B,\" he said.\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat notes Caplyta has a cleaner safety profile than its rivals. It's already annualizing $700 million in sales and will likely hit $1 billion-plus in 2025. That's before the Food and Drug Administration likely approves it as a depression treatment. He expects the deal to be accretive to earnings in the first year.\n\n\"From JNJ perspective, it builds on their commitment to neuropsych, it is accretive immediately with a very good line of sight to $5B peak, and even if IP beyond early 2030s isn't airtight, long-acting formulations, etc. helps majorly,\" he said in a report.\n\nEli Lilly Buys A Cancer Drug\n\nIn other acquisition news, Eli Lilly (LLY) announced its plan to buy a drug called STX-478 from privately held Scorpion Therapeutics. The drug blocks PI3Ka, a kinase involved in cancer cell growth. The acquisition is timely given Lilly terminated its own PI3Ka program in August.\n\nThe up-front payment plus future milestone payments could total up to $2.5 billion.\n\nScorpion has been developing the drug as a treatment for breast cancer and other advanced solid tumors.\n\nFollow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @IBD_AGatlin.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nBiotech Stocks Prepare For Action In 2025.

            "content": "Why would Ben Johnson, Aaron Glenn leave the Lions? Examining the case for each HC opening\n\nWith the New England Patriots hiring Mike Vrabel on Sunday, it became official: The NFL is down to five vacancies at head coach.\n\nAll five teams searching for a new leader \u2014 the Chicago Bears, Jacksonville Jaguars, New York Jets, Las Vegas Raiders and New Orleans Saints \u2014 have conducted a virtual interview with Detroit Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn. The Bears, Jaguars and Raiders have done the same with offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, arguably this hiring cycle's top candidate.\n\nGlenn and Johnson have it good with the Lions, but as Johnson put it last month, \"there's a burning desire in every man to find what he's made out of, push the limits and see if he's got what it takes.\"\n\nDetroit's coordinators want a shot at captaining their own organization. With that known, here's a breakdown of the five availabilities, and what could make each of them alluring.\n\nChicago Bears\n\n2024 record: 5-12\n\n5-12 Offensive averages: 284.6 yards (32nd), 18.2 points (28th)\n\n284.6 yards (32nd), 18.2 points (28th) Defensive averages: 354.3 yards (27th), 21.8 points (13th)\n\n354.3 yards (27th), 21.8 points (13th) Interviewed (virtually): Glenn, Johnson\n\nThere wasn't much team success in Caleb Williams' first year, but the rookie quarterback flashed the talent that led to him being selected No. 1 overall in 2024. Williams completed 62.5% of his passes for 3,541 yards, 20 touchdowns and six interceptions this season, and he added 489 rushing yards on 81 attempts.\n\nChicago's best offensive weapons \u2014 running back D'Andre Swift, tight end Cole Kmet and receivers D.J. Moore and Rome Odunze \u2014 are all under contract for next season, and the Bears aren't totally devoid of defensive talent; linemen Montez Sweat and Gervon Dexter and defensive backs Jaylon Johnson and Kyler Gordon are all set to return in 2025.\n\nThe biggest concern for joining the Bears is attaching to a general manager (Ryan Poles) who is about to enter his fourth season and doesn't yet have a campaign above .500. If the results aren't strong in a new head coach's first and second years, is Poles out the door? If so, is that coach given the one-and-done (or two-and-done) treatment so the franchise can have a total reset?\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\n\n2024 record: 4-13\n\n4-13 Offensive averages: 306.2 yards (25th), 18.8 points (26th)\n\n306.2 yards (25th), 18.8 points (26th) Defensive averages: 389.9 yards (31st), 25.6 points (28th)\n\n389.9 yards (31st), 25.6 points (28th) Interviewed (virtually): Glenn, Johnson\n\nSimilar to the Bears, Jacksonville seems to have its quarterback situation figured out, with Trevor Lawrence. The fourth-year pro hasn't transcended the league like some thought he would coming out of Clemson, but he's got two 4,000-yard passing seasons and ranked 10th in big-time throws (13) through the first nine weeks of 2024 \u2014 before he missed two games with a shoulder injury and then was placed on injured reserve after suffering a concussion in his return.\n\nThe Jaguars have some semblance of an offensive line. Left tackle Walker Little finished with an overall offensive grade of 72.8 from Pro Football Focus, which ranks 34th out of the 91 tackles in the NFL who played 200 or more snaps this season; guards Ezra Cleveland (37th) and Brandon Scherff (38th) also ranked in the top half of the 86 qualified players at their position. There's also some playmakers to be used, with tight end Evan Engram, running backs Travis Etienne and Tank Bigsby and receivers Christian Kirk, Gabe Davis and Brian Thomas Jr. all on the books for next year.\n\nJacksonville's problem, like the Bears, is general manager Trent Baalke remains with the team despite struggling to find success. It's always dangerous aligning with a GM not on the same timeline.\n\nNew York Jets\n\n2024 record: 5-12\n\n5-12 Offensive averages: 310.3 yards (24th), 19.9 points (25th)\n\n310.3 yards (24th), 19.9 points (25th) Defensive averages: 313.8 yards (3rd), 23.8 points (20th)\n\n313.8 yards (3rd), 23.8 points (20th) Interviewed (virtually): Glenn\n\nWe'll start with quarterback here, as well, though it's not a positive like it was with Chicago and Jacksonville. It's still to be determined whether Aaron Rodgers returns for his 21st season, but the situation isn't particularly promising either way. It's not that Rodgers was bad in 2024 \u2014 he threw for nearly 3,900 yards and had a 2\u00bd touchdown-to-interception ratio \u2014 but he's 41 years old and is no longer the ceiling raiser he was throughout the 2010s and early 2020s.\n\nThe Jets are hiring a new general manager, and their process seems sound. They're leaving no stone unturned \u2014 13 people have been interviewed, including Lions executive Chris Spielman \u2014 after meeting with just five candidates during their last search in 2019.\n\nWith receiver Garrett Wilson and cornerback Sauce Gardner (Detroit King) both being 25 years old, there's an opportunity to build around a couple of potential stars on each side of the ball.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders\n\n2024 record: 4-13\n\n4-13 Offensive averages: 303.2 yards (27th), 18.2 points (29th)\n\n303.2 yards (27th), 18.2 points (29th) Defensive averages: 333.1 yards (15th), 25.5 points (26th)\n\n333.1 yards (15th), 25.5 points (26th) Interviewed (virtually): Glenn, Johnson\n\nOf all the options out there, the Raiders, on paper, may be the roughest to look at. They finished 2024 as one of just two teams to rank in the bottom 25 in offensive (69.4) and defensive (57.3) grades by PFF, and their overall grade of 69.5 is worst among the five organizations on this list. Rookie tight end Brock Bowers has been a smashing success, but the cupboard is otherwise pretty bare, in regard to high-end young talent. This is all without mentioning the quarterback outlook, which is completely up in the air.\n\nSomething that could attract Johnson: Tom Brady is a part owner in Las Vegas, and the future Hall of Famer has gushed about Detroit's offense at every opportunity, even going as far as saying he would've loved to play in it. Perhaps that respect could buy Johnson enough time to get through what likely will be an inevitable rebuild.\n\nNew Orleans Saints\n\n2024 record: 5-12\n\n5-12 Offensive averages: 320.1 yards (21st), 19.9 points (24th)\n\n320.1 yards (21st), 19.9 points (24th) Defensive averages: 379.9 yards (30th), 23.4 points (19th)\n\n379.9 yards (30th), 23.4 points (19th) Interviewed (virtually): Glenn\n\nNot only is the Saints personnel in a bad spot \u2014 including at quarterback, which was manned by Derek Carr and Spencer Rattler this season \u2014 they also have the worst cap situation in the NFL. For years, New Orleans refused to accept its Super Bowl window was shut. The strategy made sense at the tail end of Drew Brees' career, but he's been retired for four seasons.\n\nThe lack of bottoming out, and instead taking the kick-the-can-down-the-road approach, has led to the Saints having negative-$63.4 million in projected cap space this offseason, per Spotrac. That may lead to some tough decisions being made about a roster already lacking talent.\n\nBut just like the Raiders job could be enticing for Johnson for a unique reason, the same could be said for Glenn and the Saints. The defensive coordinator spent his final season as a player in New Orleans, and that's where he coached before he came to Detroit alongside Dan Campbell. Glenn speaks and behaves like a culture-builder, and no team should know that better than the Saints.\n\nrsilva@detroitnews.com\n\n@rich_silva18",

            "content": "Editor's note: The Patriots hired Mike Vrabel as their next head coach on Sunday morning.\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Quick-hit thoughts and notes around the New England Patriots and NFL:\n\n1. Johnson vs. Vrabel: The candidacies of the Patriots' top two options for head coach -- Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and former New England linebacker and Titans head coach Mike Vrabel -- spark a compelling question for owner Robert Kraft to answer.\n\nIn what area is he more willing to assume the greatest risk: Culture or scheme?\n\nIn Johnson, the Patriots would pair promising quarterback Drake Maye with one of the NFL's most innovative, creative playcallers and play designers. But it's unknown what type of team culture the 38-year-old Johnson could possibly create because he's never been a head coach before.\n\nIn the 49-year-old Vrabel, the Patriots would have more certainty on culture -- one rooted in accountability, details, toughness and wizards of game management -- because he has already proven it as a head coach in a six-year stint in Tennessee and that's why he's widely viewed as the favorite. But it's less certain that he could elevate the offense to the levels Johnson has lifted the Lions'.\n\nIn Vrabel's six seasons in Tennessee, the Titans finished 23rd, 10th, 3rd, 17th, 22nd and 19th in offensive efficiency, which measures success on a per-play basis. Johnson has led three out of the Lions' four best offensive efficiency seasons (since ESPN tracking began in 2006). It has helped, of course, that he has had one quarterback (Jared Goff) over that span, while Vrabel had six starting quarterbacks over his six-year tenure.\n\nStart with Johnson through the eyes of former Lions offensive lineman Lomas Brown, who played 18 years in the NFL and currently serves as an analyst on Lions' radio broadcasts.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like Ben Johnson's offense. I saw him last week after the game and told him I have a new nickname for him -- 'Savant.' He's a genius at what he does,\" Brown said. \"There are so many moving parts to his plays, and to see them all come together and executed at the highest level, it's a sight to behold.\"\n\nJohnson, who like Maye attended the University of North Carolina, began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Boston College in 2009. He has been in Detroit since 2019, initially brought aboard by former Lions head coach Matt Patricia after spending seven seasons with the Dolphins.\n\nBrown took note of Johnson's personality, and how perception hasn't always been reality.\n\n\"It's almost kind of like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, because he seems like the Clark Kent mild-mannered guy, got that easygoing look,\" he explained. \"But one day I was out at training camp this year and there was a running back who broke through the line of scrimmage and throttled it down. Ben Johnson ran from wherever he was, sprinting on the field with some expletives. He was going off.\n\nFormer Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel is a candidate for the Patriots open head coach position. Bryan Lynn/Icon Sportswire\n\n\" ... So you get that tough love, but he also knows how to follow it up with what he needs to do to keep the players engaged. Don't let the cool demeanor fool you. He has a burning desire, and I think he's going to get what he needs to get done out of the guys.\"\n\nMeanwhile, former Patriots and Titans defensive back Logan Ryan -- who played for Vrabel two seasons -- described those types of moments as commonplace under Vrabel.\n\n\"It's authentic. He's demanding and a leader, which is how he was as a player. Players can smell out if a coach isn't being himself, and with Mike Vrabel, what you see is what you get, braggadocious and in your face. He's truly himself,\" he said.\n\n\"A Mike Vrabel culture is tons of accountability and natural leadership. It's kind of what that Patriots' culture was from the player perspective in the locker room, which is holding each other accountable. He's also one of the more involved coaches on the practice field.\"\n\nRyan also noted Vrabel's acumen with strategy and game management, which Patriots fans remember well from the Titans' 20-13 win over New England on Jan. 4, 2020 in the wild-card round of the playoffs. Vrabel capitalized on a loophole in the rulebook to burn 1:49 off the clock in the fourth quarter without running a play -- keeping QB Tom Brady off the field. There was also a game in which Vrabel took a 12-men-on-the-field penalty, which saved time in what turned out to be a last-second win.\n\nRyan, who has transitioned from an 11-year playing career to a budding career as a football analyst, acknowledged one area he'll be watching closely if Vrabel lands the Patriots' job.\n\n\"The biggest question is who the offensive coordinator is going to be to develop Drake Maye, because that's so important. What I saw in Tennessee, there was some [coaching] turnover and a coach is only as good as the strength of his staff,\" he said. \"But as a leader of men, culture-setter, strategy-wise, winner -- he has all those things.\"\n\nMeanwhile, it's flipped for Johnson, whose offense has taken the NFL by storm but will need to pair that with establishing a culture like the one he's part of in Detroit under fiery head coach Dan Campbell.\n\n\"He's seen what Coach Campbell has built. Ben has had a front-row seat for that,\" Brown said. \"Remember, he wouldn't be doing it alone. Look who Dan has surrounded himself with -- an addition like [Lions special assistant to the president] Chris Spielman and the toughness he brings in. [Lions GM] Brad Holmes drafting the right players who fit the culture. To me, it's who he surrounds himself with. It's going to have to be the right people.\"\n\nDetroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson is also a candidate for the Patriots' job. Daniel Bartel-Imagn Images\n\n2. Coaches' status: Patriots assistant coaches were told Wednesday that they were on vacation and would receive an update when a head coach was hired, according to a source familiar with the situation. A new head coach could potentially keep some members of the staff who remain under contract, which leaves many in a holding pattern.\n\n3. Wolf's future: Still to be determined are the roles that executive vice president of player personnel Eliot Wolf and senior personnel executive Alonzo Highsmith would potentially have with a new coach in place. Both are part of the interview process, and while Kraft said Monday they were \"staying on,\" he also acknowledged the fluid nature of things until a new coach is in place.\n\n4. Timing it out: The Krafts' prior background with Vrabel, and NFL rules limiting the Patriots to a virtual interview with Johnson on Friday, contributes to the widespread belief that Vrabel is the front-runner. Another factor is that the Patriots could hire Vrabel immediately.\n\nBut if Johnson blows them away in the initial interview to the point that they want to wait for an in-person meeting, the earliest date the Patriots could meet in person with Johnson is Jan. 20.\n\n5. Mayo fallout: The timing and manner in which the Patriots fired Mayo, shortly after Sunday's season finale, caught some coaches and players by surprise as many were still at the facility with family members.\n\nAccording to team sources, the question of why it happened when it did was asked to Kraft in the final team meeting the next day.\n\n6. Gonzo's goal: Second-year cornerback Christian Gonzalez was a silver lining in the Patriots' 4-13 season and was recognized with a second-team AP All-Pro nod. Before he departed the locker room Monday, I asked him what area he's focusing on this offseason to take his performance to a higher level.\n\n\"Getting the ball back more,\" he said. \"I feel like I left a couple plays out there, plays I know I could have made and caught the ball. Just getting the ball back in Drake's hands, because everyone knows what he can do.\"\n\nGonzalez finished the year with two interceptions.\n\n7. Cash spending: Kraft said money spent on a new head coach and his staff, along with potential salaries for 2024 coaches who are no longer with the team, won't have an impact on what the team spends on players in 2025.\n\nAlong those lines, the Patriots finished the 2024 regular season ranked 18th in cash spending on players, according to Roster Management System -- a total of $246,175,475, which doesn't include deferred money.\n\n8. Snap leaders: Gonzalez played the highest number of snaps of any Patriots defender (87.5%) in the 2024 season, which reflected how he bounced back from missing 13 games in his rookie year due to a torn labrum. Gonzalez' durability was one question entering camp.\n\nMeanwhile, offensive lineman Mike Onwenu (93%) played the most snaps of any offensive player, and it would have been a higher total if he didn't sit most of the season finale with an eye toward keeping him healthy for 2025.\n\n9.

            "content": "Do you want the good news or the bad news first?\n\nThe Bears' pursuit of Lions' offensive coordinator Ben Johnson has already turned into its own little mini-saga. Chicago's hiring committee \u2013 all 215 of them \u2013 are doing their due dilligence in finding the next Bears coach, interviewing basically every even remotely possible option before they make a decision. Even still, (and this is the good news) it seems like Johnson remains the frontrunner for the job, if he wants it.\n\nAnd now, the bad news: they're competing against Tom Brady. According to a new Sunday morning report from NFL Network reporter Ian Rapoport, Brady's pushing the Raiders' opening hard in conversations with Johnson, and the latter is reportedly somewhat interested in the job. Considering that Mike Vrabel officially signed the dotted line in New England this weekend, it feels like the Bears and Raiders are turning into the final two choices.\n\nRaiders (aka Tom Brady) are reportedly making a strong push to hire Ben Johnson\n\n\"Now let's talk about the Raiders,\" Rapoport said. \"Ben Johnson, the Lions' offensive coordinator, interviewed with them earlier this week ... My understanding is the name to watch is Johnson. They are said to be enamored with him ... Tom Brady has loomed large recruiting Ben Johnson, imploring him to take the interview and consider the Raiders. If that is something that would be a possibility for Ben Johnson, [he] is said to at least be interested. Keep an eye on this one.\"\n\nWelp. Who knows how these interviews are going, but I don't exactly love a Tom Brady-George McCaskey matchup when it comes to pitching Johnson on a modern football environment. On paper, the Bears are a bit ahead of the Raiders: they (probably) have the better overall roster and also, you know, a franchise quarterback. Las Vegas offers the change to build an entire team from scratch, and also, you know, happens to be Las Vegas. If Johnson doesn't want to deal with coaching against his old boss twice a year, taking over the Raiders would look awfully tempting.\n\nThis feels like one of those situations where, at the end of the day, money talks. I'm not sure there's a huge difference in regards to how appealing the two jobs are, and Johnson's obviously not going to come cheap. But you never know: Tom Brady's dropped the ball against the Bears before, maybe he'll do it again.",

            "content": "HENDERSON, Nev. \u2014 At least Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis is doing things differently this time around. Or Tom Brady is, but more on that in a second.\n\nAfter firing head coach Antonio Pierce and general manager Tom Telesco two days apart last week, Davis will hire his fifth GM and sixth head coach since becoming the controlling owner in 2011. It\u2019s no coincidence the Raiders have had just two winning seasons in that timeframe.\n\nGO DEEPER What went wrong with the Raiders and Antonio Pierce: A bad staff, QB problems and an unhappy WR\n\nWhile Davis is, for the most part, hands-off when it comes to making football operations decisions, he doesn\u2019t get a pass for doing a terrible job of hiring the people who are making them.\n\nDavis hasn\u2019t shied away from shouldering that blame, and he\u2019s now dramatically revamping his approach. That began by altering the ownership structure. Last year, Davis sold 25.5 percent of the franchise. Silver Lake co-CEO and Endeavor board chairman Egon Durban and Discovery Land Company founder and chairman Michael Meldman each acquired the largest stakes at 7.5 percent each, but their influence is on the business side. The same goes for co-founder of Knighthead Capital Management Tom Wagner, who purchased 5 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to Brady, the legendary quarterback who also purchased 5 percent, and Hall of Fame defensive lineman Richard Seymour, who purchased 0.5 percent, the focus is football. Brady, in particular, has already displayed a heavy influence.\n\nBrady reached out to North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick. Although Belichick communicated that he had no plans to leave his current position \u2014 and the call may only have been to get advice \u2014 a tone was set.\n\nBrady traveled to Las Vegas last week and met with Davis, among others, before the Raiders fired Telesco on Thursday. Telesco\u2019s firing came as a surprise but, after consulting with Brady and others, Davis decided that the best path forward for Las Vegas was to start with a clean slate.\n\nGO DEEPER Jones: NFL owners show their ineptitude and impulsivity with quick coach, GM firings\n\nDavis has not spoken to the media since the firings, and when he does, the guess is that he will downplay the role of Brady, who by all accounts wants to resume his broadcasting career with Fox. He would need to convince the NFL that he is only in an advisory role with the Raiders as opposed to running the team, which several league sources are convinced he is doing.\n\nDavis has also changed his process when it comes to targeting candidates for both the GM and head coach openings, hiring the search firm Korn Ferry to help compile a list of potential candidates.\n\nHere\u2019s what else we\u2019re hearing about where things stand with the Raiders\u2019 ongoing head coach and GM searches.\n\nHead coach\n\nThe two hottest candidates league-wide are Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and former Tennessee Titans coach Mike Vrabel. Johnson interviewed with the Raiders on Friday \u2014 and one can question if he even would have given the Raiders the courtesy without Brady\u2019s involvement.\n\nThe Tom Brady factor in Las Vegas has given the Raiders an edge in attracting candidates they typically wouldn\u2019t land. His influence is a key draw, which is why coaches like Ben Johnson agreed to meet with them. \u2014 Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) January 11, 2025\n\nAs far as Vrabel, everyone with WiFi service assumed and reported that he was Brady\u2019s guy and would be in the mix for the Raiders job. But Vrabel wasn\u2019t on the Raiders\u2019 interview list last week. One reason may surprise you. Davis apparently is not interested in another go-round with \u201cThe Patriots Way\u201d after the failure of Josh McDaniels and Dave Ziegler two years ago, according to league sources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was announced early Sunday that Vrabel will be the next New England Patriots coach after interviewing with them and the New York Jets last week.\n\nThe Raiders currently have six known head-coaching candidates \u2014 Johnson and Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken, former Jets head coach Robert Saleh and former Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll.\n\nJohnson, Glenn and Spagnuolo had virtual interviews with the Raiders on Friday. Spagnuolo, 65, had three interviews for head-coaching jobs on Friday after not having one for four years. Davis, Brady and several partners sat in on the Zoom interviews, according to league sources.\n\nCarroll is slated to have an in-person interview with the Raiders on Monday. The former Seahawks coach, who by the start of next season would be the oldest head coach in NFL history, also interviewed with the Chicago Bears last week. He would give the Raiders a charismatic, experienced face of the franchise if Brady wishes to remain in the shadows alongside Davis.\n\nPete Carroll would be an experienced \u2014 and charismatic \u2014 option for the Raiders. (Jane Gershovich / Getty Images)\n\nSaleh is expected to have an in-person interview with the Raiders on Thursday, and it\u2019s unknown when Monken will interview with the Raiders.\n\nThere\u2019s been some buzz about University of Colorado head coach Deion Sanders, but the Raiders have \u201czero interest\u201d in hiring him, according to a league source. Agents using the stubbornly quiet Raiders for leverage goes as far back as the franchise\u2019s losing.\n\nIt\u2019s also been quiet on the Brian Flores front, even though the Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator is coming off a great season and has ties to Brady from New England.\n\nGeneral manager\n\nThe Raiders have yet to request GM interviews with executives on other teams or schedule interviews with unemployed executives, but there\u2019s no shortage of GM candidates out there. One of the primary reasons the Raiders fired Telesco was to ensure that their next GM is on the same page with their next head coach, so a package deal could materialize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor both Glenn and Johnson, Washington Commanders assistant GM Lance Newmark makes sense. Before getting hired by the Commanders in 2024, he spent 26 seasons with the Lions and knows both coordinators well. Relationships aside, the fact that he had a hand in both the Lions\u2019 and Commanders\u2019 transformations from bottom dwellers into contenders is impressive.\n\nLions assistant GM Ray Agnew is another option who would align with either Johnson or Glenn. He\u2019s been in his current role since 2021 and, before that, helped build the Los Angeles Rams into a contender as their director of pro personnel from 2017 to 2020. A sleeper could be Lions director of scouting Dwayne Joseph, who was the Raiders\u2019 director of pro scouting from 2019 to 2024 before taking his current role with Detroit.\n\nWhether the Raiders hire Spagnuolo as head coach or not, Chiefs assistant GM Mike Borgonzi would be a strong GM candidate. Borgonzi has spent all 16 of his seasons as an NFL executive with the Chiefs, which means he\u2019s played a hand in building rosters that have made 11 playoff appearances and won three Super Bowls. He\u2019s interviewed for both the Jets\u2019 and Titans\u2019 openings, and the Raiders would be wise to get in the mix before he\u2019s off the board.\n\nAnd whether the Raiders hire Monken or not \u2014 Monken was the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2019 offensive coordinator from 2016 to 2018 \u2014 they should bring in Buccaneers assistant GM John Spytek. Spytek was a part of the Tampa Bay contingent that brought in Brady, among others, to help win Super Bowl LV. He played college football with Brady at Michigan, so they go way back. In the post-Brady era with the Buccaneers, Spytek helped Tampa Bay identify Baker Mayfield and put together a roster that made the playoffs for the fifth straight season in 2024. The Raiders interviewed Spytek in 2022 and should interview him again.\n\nIf the Raiders were to roll with Carroll, then Seahawks assistant GM Nolan Teasley could be an option. He\u2019s been with the Seahawks for 12 years, so he overlapped with Carroll.\n\nThere are still some questions about how far Brady\u2019s reach will extend within the organization when it comes to personnel matters. The Raiders have had some GM candidates express concern about what his level of influence in building the roster will be, according to league sources.\n\nTimeline\n\nThe Raiders can\u2019t conduct in-person interviews with head-coaching candidates from playoff teams until the day after the divisional round ends, which is Jan. 20, and that\u2019s only if their team is eliminated. For head-coaching candidates on teams that advance to the conference championships, in-person interviews can\u2019t be conducted until the bye week between the conference championships and the Super Bowl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer NFL rules, no contract signing, contract announcement or contract agreement is permitted until after the end of the employing team\u2019s season.\n\nThose rules don\u2019t apply to GM candidates. Before making a head coach or GM hire, however, the Raiders are still required to conduct at least two in-person interviews with diverse candidates for each position due to the Rooney Rule.\n\nThe Raiders could hire Carroll, Saleh or any other head-coaching candidate who\u2019s currently unemployed as early as next week, but that feels unlikely. The most probable outcome is that the Raiders don\u2019t have their next GM and head coach in place until closer to the end of January.\n\nGO DEEPER NFL head coach interview process: What to know about league policies, Rooney Rule\n\n(Top photo: Brace Hemmelgarn / Getty Images)",

But it took more than seven decades and a community\u2019s persistent advocacy to get him the recognition he deserved.\n\nIn 1953, two years after graduating from Arlington High School just outside Poughkeepsie, Charles Johnson \u2014 known to his family as \u201cBuddy\u201d \u2014 sacrificed his life to save a schoolmate, Donald Dingee, and at least eight other soldiers who came under fire during a nighttime assault on the front lines of the Korean War.\n\nJohnson and Dingee were part of the U.S. Army\u2019s 3rd Infantry Division, which that summer was defending Outpost Harry, a remote base in the strategically significant \u201cIron Triangle\u201d of the Korean Peninsula. About 60 miles northeast of Seoul, the outpost guarded the most direct route to the Korean capital.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nEarly on June 10, Chinese forces attacked the base, assaulting the trenches and bunkers where Johnson\u2019s squad was located. Though Johnson was wounded in the attack, he focused on helping other soldiers more seriously injured, including Dingee, whose foot was blasted by a grenade. Johnson tied up Dingee\u2019s wound and used his belt to drag him 150 yards to a safe bunker. Along the way, he stopped to help other injured soldiers or fight enemy troops hand-to-hand, according to details the U.S. Army has published.\n\nOnce Dingee was safe, Johnson left to find weapons and ammunition to rearm other soldiers in the bunker. Recognizing the situation as \u201cuntenable,\u201d he left the bunker for the last time, telling his comrades he would \u201chold off the enemy forces as best he could,\u201d according to the Army.\n\nJohnson died on June 11 or June 12, though the fighting continued for another week.\n\nAfter the attack, Dingee spent two years in hospitals in Japan and Pennsylvania before returning home to Dutchess County.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nMost of Dingee\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s family members would learn the heroic, tragic story of what happened on the battlefield. Yet the public was mostly unaware until 50 years later, when a group of Arlington Middle School students resurfaced the legendary story at a local Memorial Day event, which they learned about as part of a middle history research project led by their teacher, Andy Arenson.\n\nThat event was also a fateful moment that brought together Dingee\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s descendants, who would embark on a 20-year fight to have Johnson\u2019s acts recognized with the U.S. Armed Forces\u2019 highest award: the Medal of Honor.\n\nIt took federal policy changes, the actions of three congressmen and advocacy from the Arlington school district and Dingee\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s families, but eventually, they were successful. On behalf of Johnson, his only living sibling, Juanita Mendez, accepted the Medal of Honor from President Joe Biden on Jan. 3 during a ceremony at the White House.\n\nPresident Joe Biden presents the Medal of Honor for late U.S. Army Pfc.

Though his surviving family did not attend the ceremony, his sister, 77-year-old Dorothea \u201cDotti\u201d Dingee, of Millbrook, said the achievement for Johnson\u2019s family was \u201cone of the highlights of her life.\u201d\n\n\u201cKnowing that Don and his friends worked so hard and it was so well-deserved, it was just amazing,\u201d she said during a phone interview Wednesday.\n\nSome have said Johnson\u2019s recognition was overdue not just because of bureaucratic delays, but also because he was Black.

He made a splash during his brief time. Johnson was elected vice president of his class and was co-captain of the basketball team. He played football, baseball and trumpet for the school\u2019s band, ran track, and sang in the choir. Johnson\u2019s peers gave him the superlatives of \u201cMost Friendly\u201d and \u201cBest Manners\u201d and the \u201cBabe Ruth\u201d award for outstanding sportsmanship and fair play.\n\nHe graduated in 1951, one year after Donald Dingee.

The friend was interested. His name was Don Dingee Jr. And he had a great story to tell about his father and the man who\u2019d saved him.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nArenson\u2019s students set to work researching Johnson\u2019s past using yearbooks, Dutchess County War Memorial records and microfiche, said Melissa Erlebacher, the district\u2019s director of communications, who has extensively advocated for Johnson\u2019s award.\n\nTop left: Melissa Erlebacher and Richard Carroll flip through a yearbook from 1951.

That was the beginning of the Charlie Johnson Legacy Project, which sought to teach students about Johnson, the man, not just Johnson, the war hero \u2014 an aspect Arenson thought was important, according to those who worked with him.\n\nThe school district describes Johnson\u2019s character using eight traits: loyalty, brotherhood, selflessness, courage, compassion, responsibility, patriotism and integrity. Seniors who exemplify these traits are given the annual Charlie Johnson Award and can qualify for the Arlington Education Foundation\u2019s Charlie Johnson Memorial Scholarship. In 2004, the middle school put on a play about Johnson\u2019s life. An after-school club bears his name. School staff even put together a children\u2019s book about his life \u2014 something Johnson\u2019s nephew thinks is important.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cYou need to see the diversity of a Black man helping out someone else just because they\u2019re another human being and those stories need to be told at a young age,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSaving a Life,\u201d by artist and Arlington High School alumnus Arden Witherwax, at the Wall of Remembrance. The sculpture depicts the scene where Johnson rescued Dingee. Kelly Marsh/Special to the Times Union\n\nIn 2010, Arlington High School added Johnson Hall with a Wall of Remembrance dedicated to graduates killed while serving in the military. In front of the stone wall with engraved names is a statue depicting that critical moment when Johnson dragged Dingee to safety while they were both wounded. A quote from Arenson is also engraved on the wall: \u201cWe honor their sacrifice and treasure the richness of their lives.\u201d Arenson died in 2014.\n\n\u201cHe would say, \u2018It\u2019s not the dates on the grave, not the beginning date or the end date, it\u2019s the dash in between that matters,\u2019\u201d said Richard Carroll, a house principal at the high school.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nCorrecting an injustice\n\nJohnson\u2019s family, former classmates, school administrators and politicians began lobbying Congress for the Medal of Honor award in 2004. Edward Johnson Jr. said his aunt, Juanita, played a big role in reaching out to dignitaries and federal officials, telling her brother\u2019s story and imploring them to give him this highest recognition.\n\nThe effort gained national attention when Emmy-winning actor Gary Sinise and Golden Globe-nominee Dennis Haysbert performed a dramatic retelling of Johnson and Dingee\u2019s story at the 2010 Capitol Memorial Day concert in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 2011, Johnson was posthumously awarded a Silver Star, the Armed Forces\u2019 third-highest military honor for valor in combat.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nA shadowbox featuring replicas, from left, of Johnson\u2019s Army marksmanship badge, Silver Star and Purple Heart. Kelly Marsh/Special to the Times Union\n\nPart of the problem was an old law requiring the Medal of Honor to be awarded within five years of the action it recognizes. Congressional advocacy for Johnson\u2019s case began with former U.S. Rep. Chris Gibson, then was picked up by former U.S. Rep. Antonio Delgado. In 2022, a bill carried by Delgado was passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, waiving the time restriction for Johnson to receive the medal.\n\nU.S. Rep. Pat Ryan, a combat veteran who now represents the district, ushered Johnson\u2019s case across the finish line.\n\n\u201cIt is righting an injustice, a historical injustice,\u201d said Carroll, the Arlington High School principal.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nEdward Johnson Jr. said he\u2019s grateful they achieved this honor for his uncle despite how long it took.\n\n\u201cI wish my grandmother had seen this recognition. I wish my dad had seen it, and some of the other siblings who have passed away, but it did happen and we got to see it,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked how Dingee may have reacted if he were alive, his sister Dorothea said, \u201cDon would have been in his glory. He really would\u2019ve been so happy.\u201d\n\nJohnson was also given other military honors, including a Purple Heart, the Republic of Korea War Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal and the United Nations Service Medal.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nJohnson\u2019s headstone and a Korean Service marker at Nine Partners Cemetery in Millbrook.

Edward Johnson Jr. said his uncle\u2019s mother declined to have him laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. She wanted to keep him close to home.\n\nJohnson\u2019s modest burial plot belies his outsized impact on the community.

            "content": "CHICAGO (CBS/CBS Sports) -- The Chicago Bears interviewed Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn for their head coach position on Saturday.\n\nBoth Johnson and Glenn have been looked at as top candidates this cycle, and for good reason. Both figures are key reasons for the Lions securing the No. 1 seed in the NFC and have shined on their respective sides of the ball.\n\nJohnson, in particular, is considered one of the top candidates for the Bears' coaching vacancy, thanks to his prowess as Detroit's play-caller on offense and helping lift the unit up to one of the most lethal in the NFL.\n\nAdding that mindset alongside former No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams as he continues to develop could be a key motivation for Chicago's pursuit of Johnson.\n\nCount Williams himself among those who have been impressed with Johnson's success in Detroit. Williams got two chances to see Johnson's offense operate up-close, in a 23-20 loss to the Lions on Thanksgiving Day, and a 34-17 loss three weeks later at Soldier Field.\n\n\"I think it's been really cool to watch,\" Williams said of their most recent matchup. \"It was fascinating to watch, because he had wrinkles for counters and things like that throughout the game. And so I think he's obviously done really well, and so it would be cool to see how that all goes down.\"\n\nJohnson began his NFL coaching career as an offensive assistant with the Miami Dolphins in 2012 and has held the role as Lions offensive coordinator since 2022. Under Johnson, the Lions offense ranked first in total points and second in total yards this season. They were also second in the league in passing yards and rushing touchdowns.\n\nJohnson also has interviewed for the Patriots' and Jaguars' head coaching vacancies and is expected to be interviewed for the Raiders' job as well.\n\nAs for Glenn, he also has plenty of appeal, particularly for a Chicago team that has a budding defense featuring corner Jaylon Johnson, defensive end Montez Sweat, and defensive tackle Gervon Dexter Sr. Glenn had a Lions defense that was banged up by injuries, but still ranked seventh in total points allowed, and was a top-10 unit in takeaways. The 52-year-old has been in his current post since 2021.\n\nMeantime, the Bears have interviewed five other candidates for their head coaching job:\n\nCardinals offensive coordinator Drew Petzing\n\nDolphins defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver\n\nFormer Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll\n\nGiants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka\n\nFormer Titans head coach Mike Vrabel\n\nThe Bears also are expected to interview several other candidates:\n\nVikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores\n\nSteelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith\n\nCommanders offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury\n\nFormer Stanford head coach and current Broncos senior personnel executive David Shaw\n\nRavens offensive coordinator Todd Monken\n\nBills offensive coordinator Joe Brady\n\nIowa State head coach Matt Campbell\n\nFormer Panthers and Commanders head coach and former Bears defensive coordinator Ron Rivera\n\nInterim Bears head coach Thomas Brown will also get an interview, and while it seems unlikely he'll get the job, he made his case on Monday to explain why he believes he deserves a shot.\n\n\"Them having a chance to see me in the building, something to me should be more impressive with everything else,\" Brown said. \"The situation, I kind of had a chance to take over, having three different jobs in the same season, which I'm not sure has happened before in the history of football. The approach I've had every single day in the building. The mentality I brought to the group. Understand the expectations as far as everybody assumes stuff gets changed because you come in and snap your fingers. That's not how change happens. Change happens over time.\"\n\nThe Bears also sought permission to interview Dallas Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy, whose contract is set to expire on Tuesday, but the Cowboys blocked Chicago from doing so. McCarthy has said his first preference is to stay in Dallas.",

The Brazilian was looking to bounce back from a loss against Josh Van.\n\nThe towering Johnson looked to use his length early, fighting from the outside and mixing in kicks with some long punches. Bunes did catch a kick, but Johnson broke free, and when Bunes launched into a takedown, Johnson rolled, using the momentum to come out on top.

            "content": "Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson might be the most popular head coaching candidate in this year\u2019s hiring cycle and as of the last 24 hours, the Raiders are said to be one of the teams to watch to get him.\n\nIn fact, an NFL Network report on Saturday stopped just short of describing the Raiders as the front runner to hire Johnson.\n\n\u201cWhile the coaching world can invite all sorts of craziness, sources say there is one particular team to keep an eye on for Johnson: the Las Vegas Raiders,\u201d NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport in the wake of Johnson\u2019s interview with the Raiders.\n\n\u201cHe has quickly emerged as the candidate to watch for Las Vegas, as the Raiders \u2014 in a search that prominently includes limited partner Tom Brady \u2014 are willing to wait as long as it takes to secure their potential future head coach\u2026 Las Vegas is said to be enamored with Johnson, sources say.\u201d\n\nLater, Rapoport went on television to say Tom Brady has been working hard to recruit Johnson to Las Vegas.\n\n\u201dThe presence of Tom Brady has loomed incredibly large,\u201d Rapoport added. \u201cBrady actually spent about an hour with his agent just talking things over, essentially recruiting Ben Johnson, giving him an idea of what Las Vegas would be like. My understanding is the organization is enamored with Ben Johnson.\u201d\n\nAs of now, all signs are pointing to the situation between Johnson and Vegas moving in a positive direction, but there is at least one reason to still have a little skepticism.\n\nAs NFL insider Josina Anderson pointed out, it was predictable that there would be significant buzz around one of the teams to interview Johnson at the start of the interview cycle.\n\n\u201cPay attention to the order of Ben Johnson\u2019s interviews, and think about how leverage is best constructed,\u201d Anderson posted on X on Saturday. \u201cThe idea is to make the team you\u2019re most interested in, the most anxious. These coaching hires are two-way decisions; thus organizations have to convince top coaching prospects just as much.\u201d\n\nNo one is denying the mutual interest between Johnson and the Raiders, and that dynamic has every reason to grow in the days ahead. But as the process plays out, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that from a negotiating standpoint, it serves Johnson well to amplify his interest in a team like the Raiders.\n\nBased on a Boston Globe report on Saturday, it sounds like Mike Vrabel is far and away the front runner to be the New England Patriots\u2019 next head coach, so it\u2019s starting to feel like Johnson and Pete Carroll are the most likely coaches to end up in Las Vegas.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal\u2019s Vinny Bonsignore hyped up Carroll\u2019s chances of getting the job, and the former Super Bowl winning coach will reportedly interview in Las Vegas on Monday.\n\n\u201cA lot of momentum is building for Pete Carroll,\u201d Bonsignore posted on X on Friday. \u201cIn many ways, he is exactly what they need right now. Likely with a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e/successor that comes on board with him.\u201d\n\nAside from the aforementioned coaches, the Raiders have been reported to have interest in at least five other candidates. Among those are Brian Flores, Aaron Glenn, Todd Monken, Robert Saleh and Steve Spagnuolo.\n\nMonken was mentioned by ESPN\u2019s Jeremy Fowler as a \u201csleeper\u201d candidate for the Raiders, and Flores has the New England connection with Brady.\n\nSafe to say, there are still a lot of moving parts in the Raiders\u2019 head coaching search, and it could be another week before they figure out the direction they are going to go.\n\nx: @raidersbeat",

Meaningful momentum in the healthcare arena requires a deft understanding of how to balance innovation across the broad spectrum \u2013 and the right partnerships can be critical to this process.\n\nReinforced by industry-leading capabilities, global scale, and financial flexibility, Johnson & Johnson brings a strong record of strategic partnering, collaboration and deal-making to accelerate innovation. While Johnson & Johnson has been recognized as the industry leader in deal-making, sustained success takes looking ahead to remain a desired Partner of Choice \u2013 and to continue driving impact for patients.\n\nStrengthening Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Innovative Medicine Pipeline\n\nOur industry-leading pipeline and portfolio is a result of an innovation-based strategy and deep scientific expertise, world-class capabilities, and a source-agnostic, win-win approach to external innovation, which includes a significant investment in both Business Development and Research & Development.\n\nWe recognize that no one company can do everything, and strategic focus is necessary. Investments and collaborations continue to bolster our pipeline with new, investigational assets and with breakthrough innovations that are in-market, helping patients today.\n\nStrategic partnerships, collaborations, and acquisitions to bring this innovation to bear have strengthened Johnson & Johnson\u2019s capabilities across oncology, immunology, and neuroscience, and in select areas of cardiopulmonary and specialty ophthalmology. In fact, the impact of many of these deals can now be found embedded in our Innovative Medicine portfolio helping to treat millions of patients around the world today.\n\n\u201cWhat matters most is the potential for transformational innovation, regardless of a partner\u2019s size, sector, or stage of development,\u201d said Nauman Shah, Global Head of Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine Business Development. \u201cOur scale, scope, and financial flexibility position us well to consider opportunities to combine capabilities that could advance healthcare \u2013 and to pursue many different types of strategic collaborations, acquisitions and partnerships.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, investments and collaborations have strengthened Johnson & Johnson\u2019s capabilities across therapeutic areas and modalities, including oral peptides, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), and CD20-targeted CAR-Ts, resulting in the advancement of breakthrough innovations that have the potential to change patient lives. Notable recent progress has been made in ADCs, precision medicine cancer drugs that carry payloads to a treatment site to inject and kill cancer cells, and bispecific antibodies, where Johnson & Johnson has added entirely new platforms to treat different immune conditions.\n\nIllustration of CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T cell immunotherapy, a process that is being developed to treat cancer. T cells (blue), part of the body\u2019s immune system, are taken from the patient and have their DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) modified by viruses (spiky spheres) so that they produce chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) proteins. These proteins will be specific to the patient\u2019s cancer. The modified T cells are then multiplied in the laboratory before being reintroduced to the patient. KEITH CHAMBERS/SCIENCE PHOTO LIB/Getty Images/Science Photo Library RF\n\nBusiness Development Approach\n\nDeep scientific expertise is vital to validate the most promising candidates, and those that fit best into Johnson & Johnson\u2019s existing portfolio and pipeline. Equally important to partnering across the innovation ecosystem are the less tangible attributes \u2013 chemistry and compatibility as enablers to strong collaboration.\n\n\u201cEstablishing trust and transparency is a priority in every deal we explore,\u201d Shah said. \u201cOf course, science is what guides us in determining whether a potential deal should move forward, but our reputation as a trustworthy potential partner opens doors and helps us to move quickly. We know the best deals are ones where patient impact is at the center, and that is what we strive for every time.\u201d\n\nPartnership in Action\n\nRecent bispecific antibodies evolution came through Johnson & Johnson\u2019s acquisition of Proteologix. Proteologix founder and Chief Executive Officer, David Shen, shared what gave Johnson & Johnson the edge in securing the deal and its early pipeline of innovative bispecific antibodies that hold the potential to transform treatments for patients living with atopic dermatitis and other immune-mediated diseases.\n\n\u201cJohnson & Johnson was very focused, quite fast, and highly collaborative, and they demonstrated that they had the expertise to advance these bispecific antibodies,\u201d Shen said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we want to see our drugs be successful in clinical settings.\u201d\n\nShen said he has consistently seen the same qualities as the Proteologix and Johnson & Johnson clinical teams collectively advance the clinical programs.\n\n\u201cIt can be hard to move things quickly, but they collaborated very closely with us to move into clinical trials following our original timeline,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are excited to see things move at this pace, because we know patients are waiting.\u201d\n\nWhile every company has different needs and goals, Shen encouraged other leaders to consider the practical benefits of partnering with a company like Johnson & Johnson that has the scope, scale, and scientific chops to quickly and effectively advance new medicines through trials and into the market.\n\nFrom left: David Lee, Global Immunology Therapeutic Area Head, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine; David Shen, Proteologix founder and Chief Executive Officer; Nauman Shah, Global Head of Business Development, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine; Tayseer Ghazzouli, Senior Director, Integration Leader, Immunology, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine\n\n\u201cJohnson & Johnson has proven to be the right partner for us,\u201d Shen said. \u201cThey are serious about our molecules, they really want to work with us, and they are moving fast in a competitive environment.\u201d\n\nContinuing to drive important innovation \u2013 in every form \u2013 is a top priority for the organization.\n\n\u201cJohnson & Johnson\u2019s pipeline is unmatched and fueled by breakthrough science and transformative technology,\u201d Shah said. \u201cAlongside our world-class internal R&D teams, we\u2019re proud of our work in business development across the broader biotech ecosystem to find collaborative ways to champion important opportunities to transform healthcare.\u201d\n\nJohnson & Johnson recognizes the power of purpose-driven collaboration and knows that, together with key stakeholders across the healthcare continuum, we can accomplish truly remarkable advances in human health.\n\nInterested in collaborating with Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine?

The Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter is an irrigated, contact-force sensing catheter powered by the TRUPULSE\u2122 Generator, and is fully integrated with the CARTO\u2122 3 System for electro-anatomical mapping and for tag indexing.1 The company expects TRUPULSE\u2122 Generator hardware compatibility in the first half of 2025. When fully approved, the platform will provide electrophysiologists with the ability to switch between radiofrequency (RF) and pulsed field (PF) energy in the same catheter they know and trust. The Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter is not currently approved in the United States. The Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter is designed on the same platform as the radiofrequency THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter \u2013 the most commonly used catheter in the world today, with many years of physician experience.\n\n\"As the number of people with AFib grows around the world, physicians are looking for integrated and flexible tools to help deliver safe, effective and efficient cardiac ablation procedures,\" said Tom De Potter, M.D., Head of Electrophysiology and Associate Director of the Heart Center, OLV Hospital, Aalst, Belgium.i \"Both PF and RF energy have important advantages in clinical practice. With the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter, having the ability to easily switch between RF and PF energy provides the flexibility to customize treatment depending on the patient anatomy and clinical need, enabling electrophysiologists to perform more targeted ablation procedures which could lead to improved outcomes for patients.\"\n\nThe safety and efficacy of the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter was investigated in the SmartfIRE clinical trial.2 Early results from the study, published in April 2024, showed that the use of the catheter led to a 100% acute success rate, with first-pass isolation achieved in 96.8% of veins.3 *\n\n\"Based on our collaboration with electrophysiologists around the world, we know that each AFib procedure is different; having both RF and PF energy through one device will allow physicians to personalize each procedure based on patient anatomy and clinical need and offer a point-by-point workflow that many of our customers prefer,\" said Jasmina Brooks, President, Electrophysiology, Johnson & Johnson MedTech. \"The Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter offers the benefit of both energy modes in one familiar device. We are pleased to bring forward this innovation to enable electrophysiologists to deliver safe and effective procedures for patients in Europe impacted by AFib.\"\n\nAdditional Studies Underway\n\nIn addition to receiving European CE Mark approval, the company is making strides to bring the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter to other regions of the world.\n\nThe company has completed enrollment in the SmartPulse clinical trial \u2013 a prospective, single arm, multi-center clinical study of 250 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) across 27 sites in the United States to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter.\n\nto evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter. The PulseSmart clinical trial, evaluating the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter in Australia and Canada , has also completed enrollment. This trial enrolled 136 patients with drug-refractory PAF across 7 sites.\n\n\"The ability to deliver both PF and RF energy via the same catheter simplifies the workflow for ablation procedures and enables personalized treatment,\" said Dr. Dhanunjaya (DJ) Lakkireddy, Executive Medical Director, Kansas City Heart Rhythm Instituteiii, who took part in the SmartPulse clinical trial.2 \"In addition, the integration of the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter with the CARTO\u2122 3 System can enable real-time catheter visualization and feedback on contact force measurements and tag indexes, which are important factors for durable lesion formation.\"\n\n\"The SmartPulse and PulseSmart studies are part of a broad set of PFA clinical trials and diverse research initiatives that Johnson & Johnson MedTech is undertaking to generate the evidence necessary to guide informed treatment decisions, optimize clinical use, and ultimately enhance AFib treatment outcomes,\" said Jennifer Currin, Ph.D., Vice President, Scientific Affairs at Johnson & Johnson MedTech.\n\nCatheter ablation is a minimally invasive procedure performed by an electrophysiologist to treat heart rhythm disorders, including AFib, by interrupting irregular electrical pathways in the heart.4 Catheter ablation can be more than four times more effective than antiarrhythmic drugs alone in preventing recurrent arrhythmia in AFib patients.ii,5\n\nIn addition to the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter, Johnson & Johnson MedTech is committed to offering a portfolio of products designed to work seamlessly together for optimal efficiency and compatibility in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.\n\nAbout the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter\n\nThe Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Platform consists of the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheterii \u2013 an irrigated, contact-force sensing catheter \u2013 and the TRUPULSE\u2122 Generator, providing both RF and PF energy to the catheter through the toggling of the two energy sources on the generator monitor.2 The catheter and the generator are fully integrated with the world's leading CARTO\u2122 3 System, enabling live 3D mapping and advanced visualization during ablation procedures.ii The Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter is the first dual energy pulsed field ablation (PFA) / radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter integrated with a PF and RF tag index.\n\nAbout the SmartfIRE Study\n\nSmartfIRE is an open-label interventional study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the investigational Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter with the TRUPULSE\u2122 Generator, in the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The study enrolled 149 adult patients in Europe with drug refractory paroxysmal AFib, identified as candidates for catheter ablation, who received (PF) or (RF) catheter ablation using the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH\u2122 SF Catheter and TRUPULSE\u2122 generator during their cardiac ablation procedure. The study includes patients experiencing recurrent symptomatic atrial fibrillation following at least one antiarrhythmic drug (AAD; class I to IV), or patients who can either not tolerate AAD or for whom AAD is contraindicated.\n\nCardiovascular Solutions from Johnson & Johnson MedTech\n\nAcross Johnson & Johnson, we are tackling the world's most complex and pervasive health challenges.

            "content": "Andrew Curtin, of North Yarmouth, Maine, filed a lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson for $25 million in September 2024. Curtin\u2019s wife, Cynthia Cartwright, was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2017 and died 4 days after receiving her diagnosis. The suit claims she regularly used J&J\u2019s talc-based baby powder and asbestos contamination of the talc caused her illness and death.\n\n\u201cAs a direct and proximate result of Ms. Cartwright\u2019s purchase, use and application of Defendant\u2019s unreasonably dangerous and defective talcum powder and joint compound J&J products,\u201d she inhaled and ingested asbestos, the suit states. J&J denies responsibility and motioned to move the lawsuit from state to federal court.\n\nIn December 2024, J&J responded to the mesothelioma lawsuit. The company stated the FDA has \u201cprimary and exclusive jurisdiction over the safety of cosmetic talc-containing products, and primary and exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether any warning must accompany cosmetic talc-containing products.\u201d\n\nJ&J added the FDA had \u201cruled, on multiple occasions, that cosmetic grade talc is a safe substance when used as intended, and further ruled that manufacturers need not provide any warnings on, or in connection with the sale of, cosmetic grade talc-containing products.\u201d\n\nCourt Reverses Decision Against J&J\n\nThousands of plaintiffs have sued J&J, claiming its talc-based products cause cancer. In December 2024, the Supreme Court of New York reversed a lower court\u2019s April 2024 ruling against J&J following the company\u2019s appeal.\n\nDoctors diagnosed Corey Tippin with peritoneal mesothelioma in October 2020. Tippin claims his illness comes from using J&J\u2019s baby powder and other talc-based products. In January 2021, Tippin sued J&J and other manufacturers of talc products.\n\nThe appellate court overturned the December 2024 decision after determining J&J presented substantial evidence, scientific studies and expert testimony showing their products couldn\u2019t have caused Tippin\u2019s deadly cancer. The court deemed Tippin\u2019s evidence insufficient.\n\nDecision Ahead for J&J\u2019s $8.2 Billion Settlement Offer\n\nThe company is proposing a settlement offer of $8.2 billion to resolve many of its legal issues. The settlement plan includes a third attempt at J&J filing for bankruptcy. After deciding the company wasn\u2019t in financial distress, a judge denied its previous attempts.\n\nFiling for bankruptcy would close nearly all of the cases against the company. If approved, a subsidiary would take on J&J\u2019s legal liabilities, a strategy known as the Texas Two-Step. A bankruptcy hearing is scheduled for February 18, 2025, to decide whether J&J\u2019s proposal offer will be allowed to move forward. J&J stands by its claim that its products don\u2019t cause cancer and aren\u2019t contaminated with asbestos.\n\nThe lawsuits included in the settlement are ovarian cancer cases. Any remaining mesothelioma cases will be handled separately. Asbestos exposure is the primary cause of mesothelioma. It can also cause other asbestos-related diseases, including lung cancer, laryngeal cancer and COPD.",

Mayor Tony Kennon and the city council members highlighted Johnson\u2019s significant contributions to both Orange Beach and the nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson, born on January 9, 1925, served his country as a Navy aviator during World War II in the South Pacific. He flew a PBY Catalina. His contributions extended beyond his military service. After the war, he worked on groundbreaking projects such as the development of the first guided cruise missile and flight testing experimental aircraft.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one of the individuals instrumental in incorporating Orange Beach as a city, Johnson\u2019s influence shaped the community's early years. His work included welding the bars for the first city jail and serving on planning committees that laid the foundation for the city's growth. He was also a key figure in establishing the Orange Beach Water Board.\n\n\n\n\n\nCouncil members reflected on Johnson's contributions to the city's infrastructure, including his role in the design and construction of community facilities. His work continues to leave a lasting impression on the council chambers and other public spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proclamation read by Mayor Tony Kennon outlined Johnson's achievements, both personal and professional. His post-war career included ownership of a successful shrimping business and involvement in motorsports, notably as a crew chief for the winning car in the 1975 National Dirt Car Championship.\n\n\n\n\n\nCouncil members expressed their admiration for Johnson\u2019s service during World War II, and Mayor Kennon described him as a member of \"the greatest generation.\" One speaker highlighted the resilience and accomplishments of young people during that era.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the ceremony, Mr. Johnson received a standing ovation from a packed room.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evening was a testament to the enduring legacy of Joe Johnson and a poignant reminder of the contributions of those who built and nurtured the Orange Beach community.\n\n",

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stock skidded Wednesday after the company temporarily paused sales of its pulsed field ablation system. The news is a boon for rivals Boston Scientific (BSX) and Medtronic (MDT).\n\nPulsed field ablation, or PFA, uses high-energy electrical pulses to treat abnormal heart rhythm. But the company says four patients experienced neurovascular events after receiving treatment with Varipulse, J&J's PFA system. Needham analyst Mike Matson says those incidents were strokes.\n\nThe news could help Boston Scientific and Medtronic, which sell rival PFA systems called Farapulse and PulseSelect.\n\n\"It is unclear how long the Varipulse sales will remain paused, but even if JNJ allows sales to be resumed, we believe that the product is now likely to be tainted and that electrophysiologists are likely to be wary of using it,\" Matson said in a client note.\n\nJ&J shares slipped 2.7%, closing at 142.27. Johnson & Johnson stock has mostly fallen since early September. Boston Scientific stock jumped 4.3% to close at 95.94, though that could be related to its acquisition of Bolt Medical, also announced Wednesday. Medtronic shares popped 3.5% to 82.68.\n\nJohnson & Johnson Stock: Varipulse Under Pressure\n\nThe company's Varipulse news isn't surprising, Needham's Matson said.\n\nIn Johnson & Johnson's pivotal study \u2014 the one that helped clinch Food and Drug Administration approval \u2014 three patients out of 277 experienced cerebrovascular events. That included two strokes and one transient ischemic attack. The latter occurs when an artery in the brain is temporarily blocked.\n\nLast September, a Mayo Clinic doctor said the issue could be related to Varipulse's waveform and/or its lasso-like design. These have \"apparently exhibited high rates of silent cerebral embolic events with prior ablation modalities,\" Matson said.\n\nHe noted the products from Boston Scientific and Medtronic don't have similar issues.\n\n\"We believe that BSX's Farapulse is largely proven at this point given the large number of real-world procedures and no indications to date of elevated stroke rates,\" he said.\n\nIt's important to note, Boston Scientific paused enrollment in a study of its PFA system in October. The company was looking to test Farapulse in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, a heart condition that causes the upper chambers to beat irregularly. Farapulse is already approved for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which involves brief episodes of irregular heart rhythm.\n\nFollow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @IBD_AGatlin.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nBoston Scientific Surges On $900 Million Takeover Of Bolt Medical\n\nVir Biotechnology Catapults 64% On Promising Results In Cancer Treatment\n\nLooking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners?

In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on JNJ. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s share was trading at $146.23 as of Jan 7th. JNJ\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 24.17 and 13.76 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nA medical technician using surgical robotics to perform minimally-invasive urologic surgery in an operating room.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), a global healthcare leader, is undergoing a strategic transformation to solidify its dominance in an ever-evolving industry. With a forward P/E ratio of 14.5, low debt levels, and a dividend yield exceeding 3%, the company presents a compelling investment opportunity. Analysts forecast over 5% annual EPS growth, driven by J&J\u2019s sharpened focus on Innovative Medicine and MedTech\u2014two sectors poised for long-term growth amid rising global healthcare demands.\n\nIn 2023, J&J restructured its business by spinning off its Consumer Health division, allowing it to concentrate on high-margin, innovation-driven segments. Innovative Medicine, the rebranded Pharmaceuticals division, continues to thrive, contributing significantly to revenue through blockbuster drugs like STELARA and DARZALEX. Together, oncology and immunology account for over 45% of pharmaceutical sales, underscoring their strategic importance. MedTech, encompassing cutting-edge medical devices in orthopedics, vision care, and surgery, now generates 44% of J&J\u2019s revenue, with products like ACUVUE lenses and Ethicon surgical tools driving robust growth. This narrowed focus enables J&J to cater effectively to an aging population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases.\n\nJ&J\u2019s global footprint further strengthens its resilience. Nearly half of its revenue comes from North America, benefiting from advanced healthcare systems and substantial R&D investment. Europe, contributing 22%, is a growth hub for oncology and MedTech innovations, while the Asia-Pacific region, at 15%, offers expanding opportunities in emerging markets. This geographical and customer diversity shields J&J from risks like regional regulatory changes or temporary dips in elective procedures.\n\nThe company\u2019s financial success is anchored in high-margin biologics and premium MedTech solutions. In 2023, oncology revenue surged by 14.6%, with DARZALEX and ERLEADA leading the charge. Immunology drugs like STELARA and TREMFYA also posted strong gains, delaying generic competition until 2025 or beyond. Meanwhile, MedTech innovations, including robotic-assisted surgical tools and Biosense Webster\u2019s electrophysiology devices, saw heightened demand as elective surgeries resumed post-pandemic. J&J\u2019s ability to command premium pricing for these products underscores its competitive edge.",

            "content": "(UPDATED) The temporary pause will allow the company to investigate four neurovascular events seen in an external evaluation study.\n\nAll ablation cases set to use the Varipulse pulsed-field ablation (PFA) system have been temporarily halted in the United States after four neurovascular events were reported during an external evaluation, device maker Johnson & Johnson Medtech announced Wednesday.\n\nThe pause, which was initiated Sunday \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d will allow the manufacturer time to investigate the root cause of the complications.\n\nJohnson & Johnson Medtech noted that because system used in the US External Evaluation study \u201cleveraged a unique platform configuration, there is no impact to commercial activity and Varipulse cases outside of the US.\u201d\n\nThe move is a setback for US rollout following Food and Drug Administration approval for Varipulse, which comes with an integrated electroanatomical mapping system, in November 2024. That was supported by the positive results of the pivotal admIRE trial in patients with drug-refractory, symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, although the occurrence of two strokes and one TIA in that study was called \u201csomewhat worrisome\u201d by a commentator at the time.\n\nAbout the pause in Varipulse use, Sumit Verma, MD (Baptist Heart & Vascular Institute, Pensacola, FL), told TCTMD that \u201cmany centers such as ours were waiting for this system to start PFA cases. This is a setback for our PFA adoption. We may have to reexplore using one of the other systems.\u201d\n\nFor Jonathan Piccini, MD (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC), \u201cit is hard to know what to make of the pause in the Varipulse launch here in the US\u201d at this point, he said, noting that in the inspIRE study, \u201cthere was a high rate of silent cerebral ischemic lesions before the treatment sequence was redesigned.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible, then, that the four neurovascular events reported now could be related to a similar issue, \u201cbut that is really speculative at this point,\u201d Piccini told TCTMD. \u201cWhether these events are due to thermal bubbles, electrolysis bubbles, air emboli, thrombus, or another mechanism is not clear and requires further investigation. It is a good reminder that as promising as PFA is, there is still much to learn about the technology and its successful delivery.\u201d\n\nExternal evaluation of Varipulse in the US\u2014which is \u201ca limited rollout intended to collect physician feedback on a new technology before broader full release,\u201d according to a J&J spokesperson\u2014has included, as of January 3, 2025, more than 130 cases performed across 14 sites by 40 operators.\n\n\u201cGlobally, the Varipulse rollout has been successful, with over 3,000 commercial cases completed,\u201d the Johnson & Johnson Medtech said, adding that it is \u201cworking diligently to complete the investigation according to our medical safety processes and resume the US External Evaluation.\u201d\n\nIt is a good reminder that as promising as PFA is, there is still much to learn about the technology and its successful delivery. Jonathan Piccini\n\nDhanunjaya Lakkireddy, MD (Kansas City Heart Rhythm Institute and Research Foundation, Overland Park, KS), said his center has been participating in the evaluation, having performed about 25 or 30 cases before the pause, and hasn\u2019t seen any neurovascular issues.\n\nThere are a number of reasons a patient may have a stroke during ablation, he said, pointing to the possibility of clots passing from the right to the left side of the heart during transseptal procedures and the potential for air getting introduced with the use of large catheters, such as the PFA catheters, and causing emboli.\n\nIn addition, Lakkireddy said, \u201cWhen you use a large-profile catheter and when you\u2019re trying to ablate a large swath of tissue in a very short period of time, you\u2019re heating up a lot of tissue and maybe there is a possibility that you break down the hematin and that could embolize and cause small strokes.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, \u201chigh-voltage electrical current delivered through these large-profile catheters can generate gas bubbles that can coalesce and form a bigger bubble significant enough to cause embolic events to the brain,\u201d he explained.\n\nOverall, Lakkireddy said he thinks these events are related to the initial experience with centers figuring out how to use the catheter and manage the workflow.\n\n\u201cFor any of these catheters that are large profile, if they are not managed properly and the workflow is not well delineated, I think people will get into trouble. This is my feeling about any of these technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a big deal. I think it\u2019s just going to go away.\u201d\n\nAs soon as the company lifts the pause, he added, his center will resume cases with Varipulse.",

Medtronic has also received FDA authorization for a second PFA device, the Affera system, and Boston Scientific has launched its next-generation Farawave Nav ablation catheter.\n\nNeedham analyst Mike Matson, in a report Wednesday, said concerns about stroke risk involving Varipulse procedures were raised previously, noting that three of the 277 total patients in J&J\u2019s Admire pivotal study had cerebrovascular events.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear how long the [Varipulse] sales will remain paused, but even if [J&J] allows sales to be resumed, we believe that the product is now likely to be tainted and that electrophysiologists are likely to be wary of using it,\u201d Matson wrote. \u201cWe believe that this will clearly benefit both [Boston Scientific] and Medtronic.\u201d\n\nCiti Research analyst Joanne Wuensch said that given the success of Varipulse in global markets, \u201cit does not seem to be a device issue per se, but potentially an aspect of it which is the issue.\u201d\n\nThe impact on U.S. commercialization is unclear, the analyst said. \u201cAt this stage, it seems to us management has prudently identified a problem, is pausing, and will assess how to proceed,\u201d Wuensch wrote to clients.\n\nJ&J said it was \u201cworking diligently to complete the investigation according to our medical safety processes\u201d and resume the U.S. external evaluation. \u201cWe expect to have more information to communicate within the coming days,\u201d the company said.",

The chemotherapy-free combination regimen met the final pre-specified secondary endpoint of OS and demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in OS versus the current standard of care osimertinib. Improvement in median OS is expected to exceed one year.\n\nUnlike progression-free survival (PFS), which tracks the time a treatment keeps a patient's cancer from progressing, OS helps patients understand the impact therapy could have on the ability to live longer from the start of treatment. Extending life expectancy is the most meaningful indicator of a treatment's impact.\n\n\"The combination of these two agents previously demonstrated an improvement in progression-free survival, but this does not always capture the impact on the entire treatment course. Evaluation of overall survival can better demonstrate the benefit of a first-line treatment regimen,\" said Stephen Liu, M.D.*, Associate Professor of Medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine and Director of Thoracic Oncology and Head of Developmental Therapeutics at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. \"Seeing this increase in overall survival in a trial with mature data is powerful and reaffirms that first-line treatment with RYBREVANT and LAZCLUZE can lead to better patient outcomes.\"\n\n\"Every milestone in clinical trials and every approval of a new drug or regimen brings hope and progress for EGFR-positive patients and their families,\" said Marcia Horn**, President of International Cancer Advocacy Network. \"These topline data from the MARIPOSA trial offer renewed optimism in the journey to extend life for EGFR-mutated patients, adding another important option for patients and oncologists.\"\n\n\"These new findings reinforce the clinically meaningful impact this chemotherapy-free regimen can have for patients worldwide with non-small cell lung cancer and represent the first overall survival benefit over the current standard of care,\" said Yusri Elsayed, M.D., M.H.Sc., Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head, Oncology, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. \"With less than 20 percent of patients living beyond five years, an incredible unmet need remains for EGFR-positive lung cancer. These MARIPOSA results show RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE can extend survival beyond the current standard of care, providing patients with more time and hope in their fight against this devastating disease. Extending median overall survival by more than a year could be transformative for these patients.\"\n\nResults from the final OS analysis build upon previously reported data from the interim analysis and positive results from the PFS analysis. MARIPOSA, which enrolled 1,074 patients, is a randomized, Phase 3 study evaluating RYBREVANT\u00ae in combination with LAZCLUZE\u2122 versus osimertinib as a first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. The study's primary endpoint was PFS (using RECIST v1.1 guidelines***) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included OS, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), second progression-free survival (PFS2) and intracranial PFS.\n\nThe safety profile of RYBREVANT\u00ae plus LAZCLUZE\u2122 was generally consistent with the profiles of the individual treatments. Adverse event rates were consistent in this arm as compared to other RYBREVANT\u00ae regimens. Venous thromboembolic events were observed with the combination. Subsequent studies showed that administering oral anticoagulant medicines prophylactically during the initial four months of the RYBREVANT\u00ae and LAZCLUZE\u2122 regimen significantly reduced the risk of thrombosis.\n\nDue to the impact of these data on patient care, these OS results will be presented at an upcoming major medical meeting, and will be shared with global health authorities.

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nA combination of two Johnson & Johnson drugs helped people with a common type of advanced lung cancer live longer than Tagrisso, a widely used medicine from AstraZeneca that\u2019s considered standard of care in certain cases.\n\nJ&J didn\u2019t disclose specific survival data from its Phase 3 study, dubbed Mariposa. But the company said Tuesday it expects its drugs Rybrevant and Lazcluze to have improved median overall survival over Tagrisso by more than one year, a notable finding that could spur wider adoption of the J&J regimen.\n\nRybrevant and Lazcluze were approved in the U.S. late last summer based on earlier data from Mariposa that showed the combination kept lung tumors in check for longer than Tagrisso. The trial involved nearly 1,100 people with previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer that had metastasized or advanced locally.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nTuesday\u2019s disclosure from J&J is a summary; full results won\u2019t be available until an \u201cupcoming medical meeting.\u201d The company also plans to share them with health regulators.\n\nStill, the finding J&J has claimed is notable. Tagrisso has become a top-selling cancer drug due to its extensive use treating non-small cell lung tumors harboring mutations in a gene known as EGFR. In a study called FLAURA, AstraZeneca showed Tagrisso treatment led to median overall survival of nearly 39 months.\n\nJ&J described the survival improvement it observed in Mariposa as \u201cclinically meaningful and statistically significant,\u201d meeting the study\u2019s final pre-specified secondary goal.\n\nWhile Rybrevant and Lazcluze are already approved for use in non-small cell lung cancer, the overall survival benefit J&J is reporting may convince more physicians to use the regimen over Tagrisso. Prior data showed the combination reduced the risk of cancer progression or death by 30% versus Tagrisso alone, but extending survival is considered more definitive evidence for a new cancer drug.\n\nStill, physicians will have to weigh the treatments\u2019 relative safety profiles. In Mariposa, 10% of people given Rybrevant and Lazcluze stopped therapy due to side effects, compared to 3% of those on Tagrisso. The combination was also associated with a type of blood clot that forms in veins, prompting the FDA to require preventive anticoagulation during the first months using J&J\u2019s regimen.\n\nAstraZeneca has also shown in further testing that adding chemotherapy to Tagrisso can improve on the benefit offered by Tagrisso alone. That addition comes with additional safety concerns of its own, however, and hasn\u2019t yet been proven to extend survival.\n\nRybrevant is a bispecific antibody that binds to two different types of proteins, called EGFR and MET. Lazcluze is an oral drug aimed at EGFR, and works by inhibiting an enzyme that can transform normal cells into cancerous ones.\n\nThey\u2019re approved in the U.S. and Europe for use together as first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with certain mutations in which pieces of DNA have been deleted or substituted.",

From his strategic roles with the Miami Dolphins to his impact on the Lions' offensive performance and quarterback development, learn what makes Johnson a respected leader in the NFL.\n\nThe Detroit Lions could potentially lose their offensive coordinator this offseason \u2013 for real this time.\n\nFor the third year in a row, other NFL teams are interested in Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson to potentially fill a vacant head coaching position. Johnson has been a hot commodity ever since he took over as the Lions offensive coordinator in 2022 thanks to his role in helping transform Detroit into a consistent top-10 offense under his watch, including leading the league in scoring in 2024.\n\nJohnson has been credited with elevating both the floor and ceiling of Detroit's offense which finished the 2024 regular season leading the NFL with an average of 33.2 points per game. He helped quarterback Jared Goff re-find his footing and establish himself as one of the better options in the league and brings a level of creativity that makes it must-watch TV every time they have the ball.\n\nHis players and assistants speak highly of him, describing him as a \"genius\" in terms of both designing and finding the right play to call. On Tuesday, head coach Dan Campbell said he selfishly doesn't want to see Johnson or defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn leave but will encourage them to pursue any opportunity offered to them.\n\n\"Their work speaks for itself, it has nothing to do with me,\" Campbell said. \"Both of those guys man, they are smart, they are grinders, they are strategic. They understand how to teach, communicate, motivate. And so their work speaks for itself. Both of those guys are more than worthy of being head coaches.\"\n\nAccording to reports, three teams \u2014 the New England Patriots, Jacksonville Jaguars and Chicago Bears \u2014 have requested to interview Johnson and Glenn has interviews set up with the Jaguars, Bears, New York Jets and New Orleans Saints. Since the Lions have the No. 1 seed, the assistants can go through with virtual interviews this week starting on Wednesday.\n\nHow to get Kings of the North poster\n\nHere is some more information on the Lions' offense under Johnson.\n\nWho is Ben Johnson? Background on offensive coordinator\n\nJohnson joined the Lions in 2019 as an offensive quality control coach under former head coach Matt Patricia. He was promoted to tight ends coach in 2020 and Campbell retained him in the same role in 2021 while also making him the passing game coordinator.\n\nHe got promoted to offensive coordinator in 2022 after Campbell took over play-calling duties halfway through 2021 from previous offensive coordinator Anthony Lynn.\n\nTHE LATEST: Aidan Hutchinson injury update: Dan Campbell shares latest news on Detroit Lions star\n\nBefore coming to Detroit, Johnson got his start as an NFL coach with the Miami Dolphins. He joined head coach Joe Philbin with the Dolphins in 2012 as an offensive assistant, two years after Dan Campbell joined the Dolphins (Johnson and Campbell were together in Miami for four seasons, before Campbell went to New Orleans.)\n\nJohnson worked his way up to wide receivers coach in 2018 with the Dolphins before coming to Detroit. Before the NFL, he started as a graduate assistant at Boston College and became a tight ends coach. He is a former walk-on quarterback at North Carolina.\n\nWhere Lions offense ranks under Johnson\n\nThe Lions lead the NFL with an average of 33.2 points per game and second in total offense with an average of 409.5 yards per game and led the league with 410 first downs. It is a well-balanced attack with both the passing and rushing attack ranking in the top 10 in the league.\n\nDetroit ranked second in passing yardage (4,474), fourth in passing touchdowns (39) and second in yards per attempt (7.7) while attempting the 16th-most throws. The Lions ran it 534 times, third-most in the league, to accumulate the sixth-most rushing yards as a team (2,499) and second in touchdowns (29) with an average of 4.7 yards per attempt.\n\nDetroit also had five offensive players \u2014 Goff, running back Jahmyr Gibbs, wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and offensive linemen Frank Ragnow and Penei Sewell \u2014 selected to this year's Pro Bowl. Other young players like Jameson Williams have said Johnson has played a key role in helping them develop.\n\nIn 2023, the Lions finished fifth in scoring at 27.5 points per game and third in total offense. In 2022, Detroit finished fifth in scoring at 26.6 points per game and fourth in total offense.\n\nPrevious interviews\n\nJohnson interviewed with five teams looking for a new head coach in 2023 but ultimately decided to run it back in Detroit. He interviewed with the Washington Commanders, Carolina Panthers, Seattle Seahawks, Los Angeles Chargers and Atlanta Falcons and declined an interview with the Tennessee Titans. In 2022, he interviewed with the Panthers.\n\nCurrently, there are six head-coaching vacancies: The Bears, New York Jets, New Orleans Saints, New England Patriots, Las Vegas Raiders and Jacksonville Jaguars.",

This is why we have made it our Stock of the Day.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index consists of 11 sectors. At varying times, each sector can have more influence on the broader markets than others. Right now, health care is important.\n\nWithin these sectors, different stocks can have more influence on them than others at different times. That's the case now with the healthcare sector and JNJ.\n\nAs you can see on the chart, $143.50 has been support for Johnson & Johnson and it is now trading close to this level. If this support breaks, it could pull the healthcare sector lower. And this could pull the entire stock market down along with it.\n\nRead Also: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Says Company Losing Money On ChatGPT Pro Plan\n\nIt isn't a coincidence that there is support at this level. It was support in April. Then it was support in May and June and now it is support again.\n\nSupport forming at prices that had previously been support is a common occurrence in the financial markets. It is a result of investor and trader psychology.\n\nIt is due to \u2018seller's remorse'.\n\nSome who sold their shares at the support level come to regret doing so if the price rallies soon after. Some of these remorseful sellers decide that if possible, they will buy their shares back at the same price they were sold at.\n\nAs a result, if and when the stock eventually reverses and drops back to the selling price, they place buy orders. If there is a sufficient quantity of these orders, it will cause support to form at the level again.\n\nThat's the case with the $143.50 level for Johnson & Johnson.\n\nIf a stock trades and stays below the support, traders say that the support has \u2018broken'. This isn't merely symbolic. It illustrates an important market dynamic.\n\nIt means that the traders and investors who created the support with their buy orders have left the market. They have finished or canceled their orders.\n\nThis is bearish because those who wish to sell will have to push the stock lower to draw buyers into to market to get their orders executed. This could force it into a new downtrend.\n\nIt may be about to happen with Johnson & Johnson. This could bring the healthcare sector lower and put downward pressure on the entire stock market.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage: Shutterstock",

            "content": "Lions OC Ben Johnson, DC Aaron Glenn head coach interviews: Tracking latest updates\n\nIt did not take long for the NFL's attempted poaching process to start.\n\nThe morning after the Detroit Lions soundly beat the Minnesota Vikings, reports started coming out that some teams without head coaches are requesting to interview offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn.\n\nJohnson has been in charge of the Lions offense for three seasons and helped the group turn into the best unit in the NFL on their way to a franchise-record 15-2 season. Glenn has been the defensive coordinator for all four seasons under head coach Dan Campbell and has overcome a number of injury obstacles this season to produce an opportunistic defense that has vastly improved from 2023.\n\nHere are live updates on Johnson and Glenn from reporters in the know as the NFL head coaching interview process kicks off this week.\n\nHow to buy Kings of the North poster\n\nThere are six head coach openings again. On Monday, NFL Network reported that Dallas and McCarthy could not come to a contract extension with his current deal set to expire, making him free to sign with another team. The Lions' coordinators could generate interest for the Cowboys after they beat them 47-9 in AT&T Stadium early in the season.\n\nBoth Glenn and Johnson interviewed for the Las Vegas Raiders' vacant head-coaching job, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The interviews reportedly took place on Friday.\n\nWhile there is strong fan sentiment there for Johnson, that opening might have taken an unexpected turn Saturday with news that Deion Sanders reportedly interested in the job.\n\nJan. 10: Glenn talks to Saints, Johnson interviews with Patriots\n\nGlenn completed his virtual interview with the New Orleans Saints on Friday and offensive coordinator Ben Johnson finished his virtual interview with the New England Patriots, the teams announced.\n\nGlenn has interviewed with the New York Jets and has interviews still scheduled with the Las Vegas Raiders, Chicago Bears and Jacksonville Jaguars. Johnson also is expected to meet with the Bears, Jaguars and Raiders.\n\nAll six teams with a head coaching vacancy have requested to interview Glenn. Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer reported the Patriots requested to interview Glenn. The Lions coordinators have three days off thanks to the bye to complete virtual interviews.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Athletic reported that Johnson will virtually interview with the Patriots, Bears and Jaguars. ESPN's Adam Schefter said Johnson's interview with New England will happen on Friday. Fox Sports also reported he will interview with the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nColumbus radio station 97.1 The Fan reported that Lions executive assistant to chairman Sheila Ford Hamp and president Rod Wood will interview for the Jets' open general manager position. Spielman, a former linebacker for the franchise in the 90s, assisted the Lions in the hiring of Dan Campbell and general manager Brad Holmes in 2021.\n\nAfter firing Antonio Pierce on Tuesday, the Las Vegas Raiders became the sixth team with a head coaching vacancy. On Wedensday, Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer reported Las Vegas put in requests to interview both of the Lions' coordinators.\n\nNFL Network reported that the New England Patriots and Jacksonville Jaguars have both requested interviews with Johnson, pushing his list of teams up to three. NFL Network's Ian Rapaport also reported Glenn has virtual interviews with the New Orleans Saints, New York Jets, Chicago Bears and Jaguars between Thursday and Saturday.\n\nNFL Network reported Monday the Chicago Bears are requesting interviews with both Johnson and Glenn for their open head coaching position. The Athletic reported while the New York Jets are not expected to put in a formal request to interview Johnson, Glenn is someone \"they are expected to have interest in\". It was later reported the Jets requested to interview Glenn.\n\nNFL head coach interview rules\n\nSunday night's outcome had a big impact on the timing of these interviews. Since the Lions won and clinched the No. 1 seed in the playoffs and a first-round bye, teams can request to virtually interview coaches on the staff starting three days after the game. Johnson and Glenn can begin interviews Wednesday. Vikings coordinators, such as defensive coordinator Brian Flores, cannot interview with a team until three days after the wild-card round ends.\n\nTeams can only conduct virtual interviews with prospective coaches until the day after the divisional round ends, Jan. 20, when in-person interviews can begin. Second interviews can begin Jan. 27, one day after conference championships (the week off before Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans on Feb. 9). These rules only apply to coaches on current playoff staffs.\n\nTURN IT UP: Lions bring heat on defense to beat Vikings, clinch No. 1 seed: 'Tonight was a statement'\n\nPast interest in Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn\n\nJohnson has been a hot name in head coach talks for the past two years after helping construct one of the best offenses in the league, which finished with the fifth-most total points in an NFL season (564) after dropping 31 on Minnesota's top-ranked defense. He took over play-calling duties in 2022 and Detroit has ranked as a top-10 offense ever since and steadily climbed to the top.\n\nLast year, Johnson interviewed with the Washington Commanders, Seattle Seahawks, Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles Chargers. He was considered the favorite in Washington, but opted to pull his name out and return to Detroit. In December, he said he has the \"fire\" to see what he could potentially do.\n\n\"I think there\u2019s a burning desire in every man to find what he\u2019s made out of and push the limits and see if he\u2019s got what it takes,\" Johnson said Dec. 19. \"And so yeah, there\u2019s a fire there. Now, when that time is? I don\u2019t know, when that\u2019ll be, but there\u2019s certainly a fire there.\"\n\nGlenn, Lions defensive coordinator beginning in 2021, put together one of his best gameplans on Sunday to neutralize Sam Darnold and a Vikings passing game in a groove down the stretch. He has had to work with over a dozen players going on injured reserve throughout the season, including starters at all three levels, but has found ways to tweak the scheme and produce good enough results to complement the offense.\n\nGlenn interviewed with the Commanders, Chargers, Falcons and Tennessee Titans in 2023. He has direct connections with two of the teams with openings this cycle, the Jets and New Orleans Saints. He spent the first eight seasons of his 15-year career as a player with the Jets and was the Saints' defensive coordinator from 2016-20.\n\nNFL head coach job openings for 2025\n\nThese are the six current teams with head coaching jobs available:\n\nChicago Bears\n\nNew Orleans Saints\n\nNew York Jets\n\nDallas Cowboys.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\n\nLas Vegas Raiders\n\nAfter last season, eight teams hired a new coach. The Patriots made the first hire this year by signing Mike Vrabel.\n\nStay tuned for the best Lions coverage throughout the playoffs and all year long at freep.com/sports/lions.\n\nFollow the Detroit Free Press on Instagram (@detroitfreepress), TikTok (@detroitfreepress), YouTube (@DetroitFreePress), X (@freep), and LinkedIn, and like us on Facebook (@detroitfreepress).\n\nStay connected and stay informed.

            "content": "At the 2025 Golden Globes, all eyes were on Vin Diesel and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson as the two action stars shared a brief yet undeniably awkward moment that reignited rumors of their long-standing feud. Their surprise interaction occurred during Diesel's presentation of the Film Cinematic and Box Office Achievement award, where he made a point to acknowledge his former \"Fast & Furious\" co-star.\n\nAs Diesel scanned the star-studded audience, his gaze fell upon Johnson. With a faint chuckle, Diesel raised a hand in a small wave and quipped, \"Hey, Dwayne,\" drawing scattered murmurs and raised eyebrows from the crowd. The playful tone didn't go unnoticed, but fans quickly noted the exchange's tension. Johnson, seated with his \"Hobbs & Shaw\" co-star Jason Statham, responded with a polite nod and a reserved smile. The fleeting moment may have seemed cordial, but it carried a weight of history among them.\n\n\u00a9 Penske Media via Getty Images Vin Diesel during the 82nd Annual Golden Globes held at The Beverly Hilton on January 05, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Rich Polk/GG2025/Penske Media via Getty Images)\n\nThe pair, who headlined \"Fast Five,\" \"Furious 6,\" and \"The Fate of the Furious,\" have had a famously tumultuous relationship. Their highly publicized feud began in 2016, when Johnson called out an unnamed co-star in a now-deleted Instagram post for unprofessional behavior on set, referring to them as \"candy asses.\" Fans quickly deduced the target was Diesel, leading to a bitter fallout. Johnson later confirmed the tension in interviews, citing a clash in their work ethics and perspectives.\n\nThe fallout had significant repercussions for the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise. Johnson ultimately opted not to return for subsequent mainline films, instead spearheading the successful spin-off \"Hobbs & Shaw\" with Statham. The absence of Johnson's fan-favorite character, Luke Hobbs, from the main saga left a noticeable gap. Still, it also allowed the WWE wrestler-turned-actor further to establish himself as a solo action star in Hollywood.\n\nWhile Diesel has occasionally hinted at reconciliation in the years since, including a public appeal in 2021 urging Johnson to return for \"Fast X,\" Johnson made it clear that he had moved on. At the time, Johnson described Diesel's comments as \"manipulative\" and reiterated that he had no plans to rejoin the franchise.\n\n\u00a9 Getty Images for Mo\u00c3\u00abt & Chandon BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 05: Dwayne Johnson attends Mo\u00c3\u00abt & Chandon At The 82nd Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton on January 05, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Mo\u00c3\u00abt & Chandon)\n\nFans at the Golden Globes took to social media to dissect the pair's body language during the exchange. Many wondered if the icy interaction signaled an ongoing rift. Others speculated whether Diesel's public acknowledgment was a step toward mending fences or simply a performative gesture.\n\nDespite their differences, the success of the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise is thanks to their combined star power. Both actors have since continued to dominate Hollywood in their rights. Diesel recently wrapped up the final chapter of the \"Fast\" saga, and Johnson expanded his portfolio with blockbuster hits like \"Moana\" and ventures outside of acting.",

            "content": "ABERDEEN, Md. - Successful Army Transformation requires novel ideas and processes that harness the emerging technologies from the rapidly changing world around us.\n\nChristopher Johnson, a mechanical engineer at the U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), is on the forefront of understanding these new technologies and is becoming one of the organization\u2019s most knowledgeable electric and hybrid electric vehicle field engineers.\n\nWhat drives him? His desire to keep learning though his work while seeking educational opportunities.\n\nIn 2022, ATC\u2019s leadership encouraged the workforce to upskill and reskill themselves to help get ready to test the next generation of Army systems. The workforce was challenged to grow their expertise by taking classes toward a degree, attending technical training, participating in conferences, and learning new professional skills.\n\nPrior to ATC\u2019s training effort, Mr. Johnson had taken the initiative to pursue some advanced classes in hybrid electric vehicles. However, his interest in his daily work and the promise of the organization to support his education pushed him to commit to formal training. He enrolled in the online Hybrid and Electric Vehicle Certificate Program offered by Michigan Technological University. Some of his graduate level courses cover battery technology and the integration of motion systems into hybrid systems and fuel cells. These courses have been relevant and applicable to the daily testing of Tactical Hybrid Electric Vehicles, also known as \u201cT-HEV\u201d, the Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR), the Remote Combat Vehicle (RCV), and M10 Booker test programs.\n\n\u201cHis contributions have already significantly improved our understanding and test methodology in this emerging technology\u201d, said David Kronick, Senior Mechanical Engineer and Johnson\u2019s co-worker.\n\nThe work Johnson and his colleagues perform on hybrid electric vehicles supports the Army\u2019s silent watch and silent mobility efforts \u2013 enabling our warfighters to move, conduct reconnaissance or surveillance operations and remain practically undetected.\n\nHybrid electric vehicles have introduced new challenges to traditional methods of testing. Johnson has used the information from his graduate courses, to develop methods to assess battery health, status of charge, and how the battery is used compared to its original design and intent.\n\n\u201cMy classes cover the process of battery charging, the potential hazards associated with batteries, and why many people might not realize that certain actions can damage them. Even though the battery may seem to function fine, hidden damage could emerge later\u201d, said Johnson. Gaining a better understanding of batteries allows Johnson and his team to mitigate hazards and reduce risks while testing.\n\nWhile safety in testing is always a top priority, Johnson found the performance of several HMMWVs with electric motors to be eye opening. \u201cDuring acceleration tests, I was amazed how [an electric motor] could move something so big, so fast\u201d, said Johnson.\n\nJohnson is also a member of ATC's Electrification Working Group (EWG), a group designated to resolve challenges and develop methods to harness new hybrid, battery and power system technologies to ensure testing is carried out efficiently and safely. Through this group, Johnson played a major role in the development of an alert system for lithium-ion batteries to help mitigate risk of battery failure to personnel and facilities.

            "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson is laying out a highly ambitious strategy to answer President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s call to pass his agenda in \u201cone big, beautiful bill\u201d \u2014 a plan that will test the limits of his wafer-thin Republican majority.\n\nJohnson, R-La., said Sunday that the party-line bill will include provisions about border security, energy, manufacturing and tax policy. He also called for extending the debt ceiling in the same bill and passing it out of the House as early as the first week of April.\n\nThat is an exceptionally tall order for a tiny House majority of 219-215 that is expected to shrink even further in the coming months as two GOP members resign to join the Trump administration. When that happens, Johnson won\u2019t be able to lose a single vote without needing help from Democrats until the seats are filled.\n\nRepublicans plan to use the budget \u201creconciliation\u201d process to pass the massive Trump agenda package. That allows them to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, where Republicans have 53 seats \u2014 and after Jan. 20, a tiebreaking vote from incoming Vice President JD Vance \u2014 and can cut Democrats out of the process.\n\nOne bill or two?\n\nKey senators, including Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., have been pushing to break it up into two bills \u2014 allowing Republicans to score a quick victory on border funding and take some time to craft a second tax bill.\n\nBut Johnson and Trump say they prefer a single package.\u201cThe plan in the House has been one bill. We met for two days over the weekend \u2014 two full days of discussion and strategizing with that in mind. And so that\u2019s our assumption right now,\u201d Johnson told reporters Monday. \u201cThe Senate has a little different opinion and perspective on reconciliation and what the wisest strategy is than the House. And that\u2019s OK; that\u2019s part of this process.\n\n\u201cWe are going to get this mission accomplished,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., told NBC News that renewing Trump\u2019s tax cuts, trillions of dollars of which expire at the end of this year, is the more difficult ask.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to do the tax aspect in the first bill, we\u2019re going to have to really saddle up and ride. Because that\u2019s going to be, obviously, the most complicated part,\u201d Kennedy said Monday before Congress certified Trump\u2019s election win. \u201cIronically, the immigration part, the border security, is probably going to be the easiest thing that we\u2019ll tackle.\u201d\n\nTo appease lawmakers and Trump allies who want to deal with the border immediately, House and Senate Republicans will bring a series of immigration and border security bills up for votes in the coming weeks, according to two people with knowledge of the plans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got six months to a year to demonstrate to the American people that we\u2019re going to bring change,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cNow, whether you do it in one bill or two bills, frankly, I can teach that round or flat. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chair of the Budget Committee, which will oversee the Senate process, warned against a one-bill strategy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very worried,\u201d he said Sunday on Fox News. \u201cIf we don\u2019t put border first and get it done, it\u2019s going to be a nightmare for our national security. ... If you hold border security hostage to get tax cuts, you\u2019re playing Russian roulette with our national security.\u201d\n\nThune also weighed in Monday, saying Republicans are \u201cworking through\u201d how to proceed when he was asked about one versus two bills.\n\n\u201cThe process issues here are a lot less important than the results,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nHouse Ways & Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., said Trump\u2019s preference for a single bill means the debate is settled.\n\n\u201cThe House is doing one bill,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been decided.\u201d\n\nLimitations on the bill\n\nThe 50-vote reconciliation process means the package must follow strict rules and be limited to matters involving taxes and spending. Under what\u2019s called the \u201cByrd Rule\u201d (named for late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.), senators from either party can challenge parts of a reconciliation bill that don\u2019t meet those criteria. The Senate parliamentarian must rule whether those provisions are really about taxes and spending or not \u2014 and if not, they\u2019re stripped out.\n\nThe only way to avoid that is to overrule the parliamentarian, which even some hard-line rank-and-file Republicans are already saying they prefer not to do.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty committed to preserving the filibuster, and that\u2019s kind of like blowing up the filibuster,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a Trump ally, said last month, adding that Republicans \u201cdon\u2019t need to change policy\u201d to achieve their goals on the border.\n\nA serious complication is Johnson\u2019s call to use the party-line bill to lift the debt ceiling, which Congress will need to do this year to prevent an economically calamitous default on U.S. obligations. It\u2019s an issue many Republicans hate to deal with, usually requiring Democratic votes, and Johnson\u2019s majority includes plenty of members who have never voted to raise the country\u2019s borrowing limit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what amount he\u2019s talking about or what time frame, but if you\u2019re going to increase the debt ceiling, you need real cuts. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s that simple,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said in an interview Monday.\n\n\u201cWe suck at cutting. If we could cut 12 cents I\u2019d freaking throw a God-darn parade,\u201d he said, before making clear he was joking about the latter.\n\nRoy declined to identify a dollar amount. \u201cWe need meaningful, significant cuts. I wouldn\u2019t want to pre-negotiate that,\u201d he said, making it clear that \u201cwe need to decrease deficits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole point of reconciliation is to get to deficit neutrality,\u201d he added.\n\nThat will be very difficult to achieve in a bill that would be likely to add trillions of dollars to the long-term debt by extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts before they expire at the end of this year. Trump is also calling on Congress to attach his \u201cno tax on tips\u201d proposal, which is projected to increase the cost of the package.\n\nThere are other potential nuisances that Republicans may encounter. A massive package goes against perennial GOP demands to legislate in smaller, single-subject bills. And an undertaking of such magnitude would have to be negotiated by party leaders, which frequently raises hackles among conservatives who say legislation should be developed from the bottom up at the committee level.\n\nIn a Truth Social post Sunday night, Trump called for Congress to advance his agenda in \u201cone powerful Bill.\u201d But on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show Monday, he kept the door ajar to the two-bill strategy, saying he sees the advantages of it.\n\n\u201cI favor one bill. I also want to get everything passed. And you know, there are some people that don\u2019t necessarily agree with it. So I\u2019m open to that, also,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMy preference is one big, as I say, one big, beautiful bill. Now, to do that takes longer. You know, to submit it takes longer, actually. But, so it\u2019s a longer process. I would say I\u2019d live with that. ... To me, it just is a cleaner, it\u2019s cleaner. It\u2019s nicer. Now, with that being said, we\u2019d get some border work done a little bit earlier, et cetera, et cetera.\u201d\n\nKennedy said Trump and Republicans need to make that decision quickly and get to work.\n\n\u201cI just want to know what the president thinks. I just want to have an agreement. Again, I\u2019m not wedded to either one bill or two bills,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think we need to all get in the same room and say, OK, here\u2019s our game plan. And some will be happy, some will be sad. Because there\u2019s some people that feel strongly in the Senate that we ought to split them up. But I understand the House\u2019s position, too. We can probably clear a lot of that up with the president with a phone call.\u201d",

As a producer to say, Okay, we\u2019re going to take Dwayne Johnson, who\u2019s associated with wrestling, and we\u2019re going to force this cinematic world, audience members, to regard his character as someone that they don\u2019t know \u2013 Hobbs hits you like a ton of bricks.\u201d\n\nJohnson didn\u2019t appear to completely appreciate the approach.\n\n\u201cWhat I came to realize is that we have a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating,\u201d Johnson said of Diesel in a 2018 interview with Rolling Stone. \u201cIt took me some time, but I\u2019m grateful for that clarity. Whether we work together again or not.\u201d\n\nIn a 2021 Vanity Fair story, Johnson pushed back on Diesel\u2019s comments about trying to assist his acting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around the block a lot of times. Unlike him, I did not come from the world of theater,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou know, I came up differently and was raised differently. And I came from a completely different culture and environment,\u201d Johnson continued. \u201cI go into every project giving it my all. And if I feel that there\u2019s some things that need to be squared away and handled and taken care of, then I do it. And it\u2019s just that simple.\u201d\n\nJohnson went on to star in the 2019 spin off \u201cFast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,\u201d but did not appear in the 2021 film \u201cF9.\u201d\n\nHe and Diesel have not worked together since.",

Diesel had extended an invitation to Johnson in November 2021 to join \u201cFast X,\u201d but Johnson said at the time that \u201cI would not be returning to the franchise.\u201d That turned out to be a bluff, and Johnson and Diesel will once again star in a movie together via the upcoming 11th \u201cFast\u201d movie.\n\nThe Diesel-Johnson \u201cFast\u201d feud originally went viral in August 2016 after Johnson called out a \u201cchicken shit\u201d and \u201ccandy ass\u201d co-star on Instagram. Word soon got out that Johnson was referring to Diesel, who later told Men\u2019s Health in 2021 that the \u201ctough love\u201d he gave The Rock in trying to get a great performance out of him is what led to tension on set.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cIt was a tough character to embody, the Hobbs character,\u201d Diesel said at the time. \u201cMy approach at the time was a lot of tough love to assist in getting that performance where it needed to be.

            "content": "Report: Bears' top coaching targets are Ben Johnson, Mike Vrabel\n\nThe rumor mill has been hot and busy on the final Sunday of the 2024 NFL regular season, and the Chicago Bears are one of the biggest topics in the head coaching conversation.\n\nWith many names being rumored and attached to the Bears' head coaching vacancy, there are two names who continuously get discussed: Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and former Tennessee Titans head coach Mike Vrabel.\n\nDuring the NFL Today show on CBS, insider Jonathan Jones discussed both Vrabel and Johnson potentially being linked to the Bears and the team's interest in both. Detailing the difference between both coaching candidates, Jones said that teams who are all in on one of the candidates will more than likely not be in all in on the other, meaning the Bears will have to decide which direction is best for them between the two.\n\n\"Mike Vrabel, Ben Johnson, are the top two candidates but they are different people,\" Jones said on Sunday. \"I had a source tell me if you're all in on Vrabel, you won't be all in on Ben, and vice versa. There's interest in Chicago in both coaches, GM Ryan Poles, he'll be making the call on the head coach and team owner George McCaskey wants his football team, to handle the football [side].\"\n\nNow that the 2024 regular season has concluded, with the Bears getting a 24-22 victory over the Green Packers, the focus and conversation shifts to the focus of the search for their next head coach.",

            "content": "Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and former Tennessee Titans head coach Mike Vrabel have dominated headlines as coaching candidates in the NFL, and the Chicago Bears have been connected to both.\n\nJonathan Jones of CBS Sports reported Sunday that Chicago is interested in the top candidates after firing Matt Eberflus during the 2024 campaign:\n\nThis comes after general manager Ryan Poles told ESPN 1000's Bears pregame show the team will interview current interim coach Thomas Brown for the position as well.\n\n\"He will get an interview, and I'm excited to hear his thoughts,\" Poles said of Brown. \"Because he's been here. He's been here, he's seen and reflected just like we have on the past and how we got to this and why were the results, the results. So I'm excited to hear from his side on how we got here and how he would fix it.\"\n\nBrown has made his way up the ranks this season, which started with him as the passing game coordinator and ends Sunday with him filling the role of interim head coach.\n\nChicago promoted him to interim offensive coordinator when it fired Shane Waldron and interim head coach after it fired Eberflus. However, the team is also 0-4 during Brown's tenure as the interim head coach, which could impact his chances for the full-time job.\n\nAs for Vrabel and Johnson, they would represent two distinctly different approaches for the Bears.\n\nOn the one hand is Johnson, who is someone with an offensive background but no experience as an NFL head coach. On the other hand is Vrabel, who has a defensive background and extensive experience as a head coach of the Titans for six seasons from 2018 through 2023.\n\nVrabel went 54-45 overall and made the playoffs three times during that six-year span. He even reached the AFC Championship Game with Ryan Tannehill as his quarterback during the 2019 campaign and is someone who could overachieve with a roster that may not stack up to the best in the league.\n\nYet Chicago's long-term fortunes will likely rest on whether Caleb Williams lives up to expectations as the No. 1 overall pick of the 2024 NFL draft.\n\nThis is an organization that has long searched for a franchise quarterback, and its inability to find one is a major reason it is looking for its fifth head coach since 2012. Giving Williams the best chance to become that franchise quarterback seems to be the best long-term approach, and that likely means bringing in an offensive-minded coach.\n\nJohnson, who is in his third season as the offensive coordinator of the Lions, is just that.",

            "content": "Our firm\u2019s national mass tort lawyers attorneys continuously monitor and track events in the various class action MDLs pending in the federal courts (MDL Docket #s). We track the volume of new cases being filed or transferred into each MDL every month, the trends or patterns in new case filings, and the status of bellwether trials, discovery, and other proceedings. And, of course, we track mass tort settlement amounts.\n\nWith a new year, we are starting to get a clearer picture of what we can expect in 2025 from the various mass tort MDLs, including those ready to grow and those ready to settle.\n\nThis post examines the hottest, biggest, and most compelling mass torts in 2025. If you click the individual links, we also project these settlement amounts.\n\nThe Biggest Class Action MDLs in 2025\n\nFor the last several years, the biggest MDL by far has been the 3M Earplugs MDL. At one point, the 3M Earplugs MDL had around 300,000 pending cases, making it the biggest MDL every. The 3M Earplugs MDL is technically still pending and with over 100,000 cases it would still be the \u201cbiggest.\u201d However, we omitted it from this list because the litigation is essentially over. Below is our revised list of the biggest mass tort MDLs (by number of pending cases or claims) in 2025:\n\n#1 Talcum Powder Lawsuit\n\nThe second biggest class action MDL is still the talcum powder class action against Johnson & Johnson. These cases allege that chronic exposure to talc in products such as baby powder caused cancer. As of January 2025, there are 58,000 pending cases in the talc class action MDL.\n\nFor the last few years, this litigation has been on and off again as J&J has made several fairly notorious attempts to force the cases to be resolved in bankruptcy. After those efforts were mostly unsuccessful, J&J began making global settlement offers that most plaintiffs were satisfied with. The $10 billion settlement proposal remains very controversial and still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court.\n\n#2 C.R. Bard Hernia Mesh Lawsuit\n\nThe C.R. Bard Hernia Mesh MDL is the largest of several mass tort MDLs involving defective hernia mesh patches made by various companies. As of January 2025, there were over 24,000 plaintiffs with pending cases in the C.R. Bard Hernia Mesh MDL. Hundreds of new hernia mesh lawsuits have been transferred into this MDL over the last six months, making it one of the more active mass torts.\n\nAn agreement to settle most of the Bard lawsuits was reached in October of last year so this MDL will be winding down in 2025.\n\n#3: Hair Relaxer Lawsuit\n\nIn October of 2022, a groundbreaking study from NIH was published showing that regular use of chemical hair relaxer products could significantly increase the risk of uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, and other conditions such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids. This immediately prompted a wave of hair relaxer cancer lawsuits that were promptly consolidated into a new class action MDL.\n\nThe size of the potential plaintiff field for the hair relaxer class action litigation is massive. Millions of African American women in the U.S. use hair relaxers on a regular basis their entire adult lives. That means that almost every black woman diagnosed with uterine or ovarian cancer is a potential plaintiff.\n\nAt this time last year, we were making some very bold predictions about this MDL growing to 15,000 or even 20,000 cases. For the first few months of 2024 it looked liked those predictions might come true as 6,000 new cases were added in a span of just 3 months. Since then, however, the pace of new cases has slowed down significantly. As of January 2025, there are 9,819 pending cases in the MDL. That is still enough to rank #3 on the list of biggest mass torts.\n\nMDLs to Watch\n\n#1 Paraquat Parkinson\u2019s Lawsuit\n\nThe Paraquat class action MDL was one of the hottest mass torts in 2023 in terms of growth. Things slowed down in 2024, with only about 350 new cases added over the year. The Paraquat cases allege that chronic exposure to this industrial herbicide causes Parkinson\u2019s disease. The litigation is small, but the size of the injury\u2014Parkinson\u2019s disease is truly awful\u2014is great.\n\nHeading into 2025 there are 5,825 pending cases in the Paraquat MDL. The Paraquat cases are strong, and a trial is coming up assuming, as we do, that the judge allows these cases to move forward (plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers need more and better experts). So a Paraquat settlement could be on the horizon assuming the judge decides the science linking Parkinson\u2019s and Paraquat is sufficient. It is hard to imagine that the defendants would let one of these cases go to trial.\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease is a brutal condition. So the settlement payouts in these cases could be very high. I do not think the defendants will let these cases go to trial. So if the defendants do not get out on Daubert \u2013 and all indications are they will not \u2013 my guess is that these cases will settle before the end of the year. How will they settle? I think the defendants will go the Roundup route and settle with individual plaintiffs\u2019 law firms. But that is pure speculation.\n\n#2 Paragard IUD Lawsuit\n\nThe Paragard lawsuits allege that the Paragard IUD device had a design defect that caused it to fracture during removal, leaving pieces inside the body. As of January 2025, the Paragard class action MDL has 2,882 pending cases.\n\nThe growth trend in the Paragard MDL was always very steady, but it slowed down significantly in 2024. This MDL has been moving extremely slowly. In fact, if we had a category on this page for \u201cslowest MDLs\u201d this would be #1. That being said, we FINALLY have bellwether trials set for 2025 (assuming the MDL judge doesn\u2019t find a reason to postpone) so we could actually see something happen this year in Paragard.\n\n#3 Tepezza Hearing Loss Lawsuit\n\nTepezza is a new prescription drug that is taken in a series of injections to treat thyroid eye disease (TED). Soon after Tepezza was released on the U.S. market, reports started coming back that a high percentage of patients who received Tepezza injections were suffering permanent hearing loss.\n\nAdditional scientific research eventually established that the hearing damage was a side effect of Tepezza and it was often permanent. Moreover, the manufacturer of Tepezza failed to disclose the true risk of this side effect.\n\nAnyone who suffered permanent hearing loss or tinnitus (ringing in the ears) after receiving Tepezza injections may be eligible to file a lawsuit and get financial compensation. A growing number of Tepezza lawsuits have been filed across the country, and the Tepezza lawsuits in federal courts were consolidated into an MDL in 2024. So far growth in this MDL has been slow, but these are widely viewed as solid cases.\n\n#4 Bard PowerPort Lawsuit\n\nThe Bard PowerPort is a port catheter medical device that is implanted under a patient\u2019s skin to give doctors direct access to veins for regular and convenient attachment to catheters for fluid and medication delivery intravenously. Design and manufacturing flaws in the Bard PowerPort have made this device highly prone to fracture and/or migrate after being implanted. These events usually result in serious complications and injuries including infection and internal vascular damage.\n\nPatients who received a Bard PowerPort implant device and suffered serious injuries when the PowerPort fractured or migrated after implantation can file a product liability lawsuit and seek compensation. A growing volume of Bard PowerPort lawsuits have already been filed in federal courts around the U.S.\n\nA Bard PowerPort class action MDL was created back in 2023. For the first 10 months the volume of new cases added to the MDL was very slow, but in the second half of last year we saw big surge in new cases. This MDL went from around 150 cases at the start of 2024, to 891 pending cases as we head into 2025.\n\n#5 Roundup Cancer Lawsuit\n\nRoundup was once the most popular consumer weedkiller product on the market. But recent evidence linking the chemical in Roundup (glyphosate) to cancer prompted a flood of Roundup product liability lawsuits. After a series of massive verdicts in 2018-2019, Monsanto (Bayer) started settling large blocks of cases.\n\nBayer won 10 in a row with the remaining Roundup lawsuits. Smoke and mirrors were involved. Bayer settled the best cases and let the weaker cases go to trial. One case was so awful that it was dismissed in the middle of the trial.\n\nBut Bayer got overconfident. It started believing its own press clipping and forgot its won-loss record was because they were scheduling the weakest cases for trial. Then, it lost five cases in a row, losing billions in the process. Things seemed poised for a settlement, but then Bayer started winning some hand picked cases at trial. 2025 will be an interesting year for Roundup in terms of whether Bayer continues its strategy of trending water or makes a serious attempt to resolve these claims.\n\n#6 Social Media Addiction Lawsuit\n\nThis MDL consolidates numerous lawsuits alleging that companies like Meta (operating Facebook and Instagram), ByteDance (TikTok), Google (YouTube), and Snap (Snapchat) have designed addictive algorithms. These algorithms are claimed to keep users, especially youths, engaged for unhealthy lengths of time, leading to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and suicidal ideation.\n\nIn January 2023, these social media addiction lawsuits were merged into an MDL presided over by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the Northern District of California. As of January 2025, the MDL comprises over 900 lawsuits.\n\nThe core of these lawsuits is the assertion that social media platforms deliberately exploit the vulnerability of users through addictive features that result in significant harm. The major platforms involved are currently facing these allegations are trying to hide behind the skirt of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and the First Amendment rights. But so far, that has not proved to be the magic elixir defense they hoped.\n\nCurrently, the MDL is still in the pre-trial phase, focusing on addressing motions to dismiss, and no settlements or jury verdicts have been reached. This social media addiction litigation is expected to grow even more in 2025.\n\n#7 Valsartan Lawsuits\n\nThe Valsartan lawsuits have been pending in a class action MDL for several years now. The lawsuits allege that certain batches of the drug were contaminated with NDMA (a known carcinogen) during the manufacturing process. The plaintiffs are seeking damages for injuries including liver damage and gastric cancer.\n\nAs of January 2025 there are 1,288 pending cases in the Valsartan MDL.\n\nClass Actions Most Likely to Settle in 2025\n\nBased on what our lawyers have been hearing, one mass tort MDL seems most likely to be resolved with global settlements in 2025.\n\n#1: AFFF Firefighting Foam Lawsuit\n\nThe AFFF firefighting foam lawsuits allege that exposure to so-called forever chemicals in AFFF firefighting foam (used to put out large fires) caused countless firefighters and military veterans to develop cancer. As of January 2025, there are 7,600 AFFF cancer lawsuits pending in the MDL.\n\nThere is widespread speculation that a global settlement deal could be in the works for the AFFF lawsuits. The defendants have already settled most cases brought by municipalities. So a global AFFF settlement makes sense and it could happen in 2025. We think these are really strong cases.\n\nClass Actions Ready to Grow in 2025\n\nThe class action MDLs in this section are those that are ready to post explosive growth as 2024 continues because of the size of the potential plaintiff field or other circumstances.\n\n#1 Depo-Provera Brain Tumor Lawsuits\n\nDepo-Provera is better known as the \u201cbirth control shot.\u201d It is an injection that provides birth control for up to 3 months as an alternative to taking the pill every day. Depo-Provera has been around for decades and thousands of women have taken it for birth control.\n\nNew scientific evidence has shown that extended use of Depo-Provera can significantly increase the risk of developing certain types of brain tumors called meningiomas. The evidence linking Depo-Provera to meningioma tumors is very strong. Thousands of women who took Depo-Provera and were later diagnosed with meningiomas are now bringing Depo-Provera brain tumor lawsuits.\n\nThis mass tort is #1 on this list for 2 reasons. First, the interest level in these cases among plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys is very high right now. Second, the size of the potential plaintiff field is large. According to the FDA, an estimated 25% of the adult female population received the birth control shot at least once.\n\n#2 Hernia Mesh Lawsuit (non-Bard)\n\nA hernia mesh is a small screen-like implant that is used to reinforce muscle and tissue after a hernia repair surgery. A number of different permanent hernia mesh products have design flaws related to the material they are made out of that has caused them to malfunction resulting in post-implantation complications and injuries.\n\nThis has led to a large wave of hernia mesh lawsuits that have been consolidated into several different class action MDLs. The biggest hernia mesh MDL is that involving claims against medical device company C.R. Bard. This MDL is in the Southern District of Ohio and it has over 20,000 pending cases that we talk about above. But there are many smaller MDLs that may grow \u2013 and hopefully, settle quickly \u2013 especially when the Bard cases finally settle to help set a settlement benchmark.\n\n#3 Uber Driver Sex Abuse Lawsuit\n\nA growing number of lawsuits are being filed alleging that Uber drivers sexually assaulted passengers. The lawsuits are being filed against Uber for alleging being negligent in its screening and monitoring of its drivers and for ignoring complaints and red flags. The Uber driver sex abuse lawsuits have been consolidated into an MDL in the Northern District of California.\n\n#4 One Wheel Lawsuit\n\nThe OneWheel lawsuits are a unicorn. The self-balancing electric skateboard, the Onewheel, is at the center of a mounting number of lawsuits, which have culminated in the creation of an MDL to address allegations of design defects and safety shortcomings. These lawsuits have raised serious concerns about the Onewheel and Onewheel+ XR models, which are reportedly prone to sudden stops or shutdowns at speed. This malfunction can lead to what is termed a \u201cnosedive,\u201d causing riders to lose balance and be propelled forward, resulting in severe injuries such as bone fractures, head trauma, and spinal cord damage.\n\nThe legal claims assert that these critical issues stem from inherent defects in the design and manufacturing of the Onewheel. Additionally, plaintiffs accuse Future Motion, the manufacturer, of not providing sufficient warnings about the risk of nosedives, thus failing to inform consumers adequately about the potential dangers of using their product.\n\nThe OneWheel MDL was created in 2023 and at the start of 2025 it still only has 91 pending cases. But some cases have settled already and settlement talks continue. Future Motion wants this litigation to end sooner rather than later. The concern is the company is not big and it has limited insurance. So we think there will be a global OneWheel settlement but there is probably not enough money to go around to get everyone fully compensated.\n\nNew Class Action MDLs\n\nBelow are two new mass torts that are on their way to becoming class actions and being consolidated into MDLs. We don\u2019t have MDLs for either of these yet, but that should happen within the next few months.\n\nSuboxone Tooth Decay Lawsuit\n\nSuboxone is a drug that is used to treat opioid addiction and dependency. Suboxone is administered in a sublingual (under the tongue) insert that dissolves in the mouth.\n\nUnfortunately, Suboxone causes dry mouth and severe tooth decay. Although the drug\u2019s manufacturers were well aware of this fact for years, they refused to include a warning about tooth decay on the drug\u2019s product label.\n\nIt was only after the FDA issued a public safety warning about Suboxone tooth decay that a warning label was added. Now thousands of people who used the drug and suffered tooth decay or dental injuries are expected to file Suboxone tooth decay lawsuits.\n\nThere is now an MDL class action lawsuit. This will be really big litigation.\n\nOzempic Gallbladder Lawsuit\n\nOzempic is a very popular diabetes drug, and recently it has been widely used as a weight loss drug. Recent evidence has shown, however, that using Ozempic at high doses (which is common for weight loss) can cause serious problems with the gallbladder, including gallstones and gallbladder disease. Individuals who used Ozempic and suffered gallbladder injuries are now filing Ozempic lawsuits against the drug.\n\nThis will be litigation, and there will be plaintiffs who have a lot of damages. But there will also be many more minor injury cases where the victim had real complications, but only for a limited period of time, and they are perfectly fine now. So, putting a settlement amount on those cases will be a challenge.\n\nThere is one wild card here that will drive settlement payouts in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor. These companies are printing money with these new obesity-fighting drugs. This litigation is a distraction they will want to rid themselves of as soon as feasible.\n\nHeavy Metal Baby Food Lawsuit\n\nA new toxic baby food MDL has been established in 2924, consolidating lawsuits against major baby food manufacturers in the United States.\n\nThe consolidated lawsuits allege that certain baby food products contain unsafe levels of heavy metals, such as arsenic, lead, and mercury. Saying \u201callege\u201d is understating the case. These products clearly contain heavy metals that pose significant health risks, potentially causing developmental issues in infants and children, including conditions like autism and ADHD. The defendants in this MDL include prominent companies such as Gerber, Beech-Nut, Walmart, and Campbell Soup Company.\n\nIn April 2024, all related federal lawsuits were merged into a single case, which is being overseen by Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley in the Northern District of California. While it is still too early to predict the outcome of this litigation, baby food lawyers are growing bullish on it.\n\nZimmer Hip Replacement Lawsuits\n\nIn July 2024, Zimmer Biomet announced a national recall of all its hip replacement implants. The recall was prompted by new research which found that individuals with the Zimmer metal implant devices installed were at a significantly higher risk of suffering a thigh bone fracture compared to those with other implants.\n\nThe recall is expected to lead to a wave of Zimmer hip replacement lawsuits across the country. There is no MDL for the Zimmer hip replacement cases yet, but that seems to be a very likely scenario in the near future.\n\nBioZorb Implant Lawsuits\n\nThe BioZorb is an implant that was designed as a tissue marker fin lumpectomy surgeries. New evidence has shown that the BioZorb can cause serious complications, including chronic pain, scarring, and the need for additional surgeries. Despite its promise to aid in recovery, the device has led to outcomes that were not fully disclosed by its manufacturer, Hologic. BioZorb implant lawsuits are now being filed across the country and this litigation could gain major momentum next year.\n\nVeozah Liver Damage Lawsuits\n\nThe prescription drug Veozah is used by many middle-aged women to help reduce the side effects of menopause, specifically hot flashes. Recent studies have shown, however, that extended use of Veozah can cause serious liver damage and lead to liver failure or liver disease. This new evidence will spark a significant number of Veozah lawsuits. There is no Veozah MDL yet, but that could happen before the end of 2025.\n\nOxbryta Lawsuits\n\nOxbryta is a relatively new drug that was supposed to help treat the symptoms of sickle cell disease. Shortly after Oxbryta was released on the U.S. market in 2019, however, evidence began to show that this drug actually increased some of the symptoms of sickle cell disease, such as vaso-occlusive crises or VOCs. In September 2024 Oxbryta was voluntarily recalled due to these safety concerns, which has prompted what is expected to be a steady wave of Oxbryta lawsuits.\n\nDockets for Class Action MDLs\n\nLargest MDL in December 2024",

Even though the Tigers remain one of the most prominent women's college basketball programs, the team certainly feels her absence.\n\n\"A lot of people still ask us, 'Where's Angel?'\" star senior Aneesah Morrow admitted to the Chicago Sun-Times in a recent interview. \"What Angel's done for the game cannot be replaced.\"\n\nReese and Johnson were close friends at LSU both on and off the court, and Johnson has assumed the mantle as the team's top player in her absence - her 20.5 points per game leads the team (Morrow is not far behind at 18.4).\n\nDespite passing the reigns of the team to Johnson, Reese admitted in September during an episode of her 'Unapologetically Angel' podcast that they've drifted apart.\n\n\"I still support Flau'jae, [but] We aren't as close as we used to be,\" Reece admitted. \"And there's no hard feelings or anything, but we aren't as close as we used to be.

At LSU, Reese was the 2023 NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player as well as a two-time First-team All-American. Johnson, her protege, has captured some accolades too.\n\nThe junior guard was named the 2023 SEC Freshman of the Year and cracked the 2024 All-SEC Second-team. Averaging 20.5 points and 6.2 rebounds a night, Johnson looks poised to enter All-American conversations. At 15-0, the Tigers are ranked sixth in the nation. The program will face its first true test of the season when it visits No. 2 South Carolina in late January.",

            "content": "From what we can see, insiders were net sellers in Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ ) during the past 12 months. That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Johnson & Johnson\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Johnson & Johnson\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Global Corporate Affairs, Vanessa Broadhurst, for US$1.4m worth of shares, at about US$162 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$144. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Vanessa Broadhurst.\n\nYou can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nNYSE:JNJ Insider Trading Volume January 4th 2025\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of small cap stocks that are not only being bought by insiders but also have attractive valuations.\n\nInsiders At Johnson & Johnson Have Bought Stock Recently\n\nIt's good to see that Johnson & Johnson insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. Specifically, Independent Director Mark Weinberger bought US$147k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This is a positive in our book as it implies some confidence.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Johnson & Johnson insiders own 0.04% of the company, worth about US$144m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Johnson & Johnson Tell Us?\n\nThe recent insider purchase is heartening. But we can't say the same for the transactions over the last 12 months. The recent buying by an insider , along with high insider ownership, suggest that Johnson & Johnson insiders are fairly aligned, and optimistic. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Johnson & Johnson.",

Heading into Saturday's matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers (13-19) to begin a three-game homestand, Brooklyn provided injury updates on three players that are key members of the rotation this season.\n\nThe Nets announced that guard Cam Thomas suffered a new left hamstring strain in Thursday's 113-110 win at the Milwaukee Bucks that will sideline him for a significant amount of time. The team's press release said that Thomas \"will be reevaluated following the team\u2019s upcoming West Coast road trip,\" meaning that he will miss the next nine games at the very least, but could return for a home game against the New York Knicks on Jan. 21.\n\nForward Cam Johnson suffered a right ankle sprain in Thursday's win at the Bucks and as a result, he will miss at least the next three games. The Nets did note that Johnson will be reevaluated prior to Brooklyn's six-game west coast road trip, meaning that he could potentially return in time for a road trip that will see the Nets play against teams like the Denver Nuggets and the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nForward Trendon Watford, who has missed the past eight games with a left hamstring strain, has resumed individual on-court workouts, per the team. His status will be updated in one week's time from Saturday, meaning that he will most likely miss the next four games, but could return for a matchup at the Utah Jazz on Jan. 12 if he has progressed enough in his injury rehab to be able to play.\n\n\"It's pretty much the same way we've been doing it so far: by committee. There's going to be a lot of minutes to be played, a lot of shots to be taken. It's not just one person. I think the guys have a great mindset and the togetherness, and I think we're ready to to fill right there what we need to fill. Excited to see some of these other guys do things that (they) are not used to do or maybe as much. Good challenge for all of us,\" Nets head coach Jordi Fernandez said prior to Saturday's game against the 76ers when asked how the team will move forward in the wake of injuries to Thomas and Johnson.",

            "content": "'It all kind of fits together': Crestwood's backcourt has become one of the area's best\n\nMANTUA \u2014 One of Portage County's top backcourts resides along State Route 44.\n\nIt includes three players averaging double-digit points through Crestwood's first eight games: Brody Durham, Dekota Johnson and Steven Lincoln.\n\nIt includes Augie Schweickert, who, if the term \"perfect role player\" were ever to make it into Merriam-Webster's dictionary, might as well send his picture in for inclusion.\n\nThat backcourt quickly showed itself in the Red Devils' victory over Ravenna Monday to move to 8-0. Durham and Johnson had a 3-pointer apiece, with Durham adding a steal and assist to Lincoln and Johnson adding a baseline jumper \u2212 all in the first 90 seconds of the game.\n\n\"We were in the gym at least three, four times a week all offseason,\" Durham said. \"I think that's the main reason why we're all excelling as a team, and the singular guys, of course, but as a team, we're just doing great.\"\n\nHow Steven Lincoln, Augie Schweickert add fire to a formidable backcourt\n\nExpectations were high \u2212 for the backcourt and the Red Devils as a whole \u2212 coming off last year's 19-win season.\n\nSomehow they are blowing those expectations out of the water. Johnson, a third team all-state selection last year, has once again proven to be one of the area's most dangerous scorers at 20.1 points per game. Durham, a second team all-district pick as a freshman, has been even better to start his sophomore season, including a program-record 17 assists against LaBrae. That broke Mason Jakacki's mark of 15, and, indeed, Durham has looked a lot like Jakacki.\n\n\"His time is coming where he's going to get his shots up, but for what we need him to do right now, it's to be a facilitator,\" Crestwood coach Josh Jakacki said. \"We basically told him to pattern his game like we told Mason Jakacki - be a great defender, get guys the ball that need the ball in the right spots and continue to lead our team. He's only a sophomore, but he plays well above his years.\"\n\nLincoln might be the greatest surprise of all.\n\nLincoln was an outstanding role player on Crestwood's 2023-2024 Chagrin Valley Conference championship team as the kind of catch-and-shoot guy every program needs.\n\nThe senior has been even better this season.\n\nHe's taking and making far more 3-pointers than a year ago, and he's doing so more efficiently, shooting 36 percent from deep. But it isn't just the 3-pointers. When he tied a career-high with 22 points against Ravenna, his four 3-pointers were just part of the story. He also stepped off the wing and dribbled into a crisp pull-up jumper from the elbow. He cut sharply to help a doubled teammate in the post, taking the pass and knocking down the contested shot in the lane.\n\n\"He's put a lot of barn work in,\" Jakacki said. \"We take pride in our offseason work and he's worked as hard as anyone to get his game to where it's at. He reminds me a lot of Charlie Schweickert, who took the same kind of leap from his junior to senior year, going from just a catch-and-shoot kid to a kid who we trust going off the bounce to a pull-up. He's been very, very good recently with his decision-making, feeding the ball in the post. [I] couldn't be happier for him.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Augie Schweickert continues to defend at a high level, while also proving to be a highly capable ball-handler.\n\n\"I consider Augie the heart of this basketball team,\" Durham said. \"Me and him are probably the biggest talkers on the floor, biggest communicators, and like myself, he's going to pass up a good shot for a great shot. All he cares about is the team. He wants to win.\"\n\nBrody Durham, Dekota Johnson share an easy rapport for Crestwood\n\nOf course, the Red Devils' backcourt starts with that easy connection between Durham and Johnson.\n\nThough two years apart, their games mesh perfectly.\n\nTwo minutes into Crestwood's win over Ravenna, Johnson found Durham for a wide-open 3-pointer. Less than a minute later, Durham, in transition, shoveled a pass to Johnson cycling behind him for another three. The timing was perfect, as if the two had executed that move a million times before. Truth be told, they probably had.\n\nTheir bond stems back long before Durham entered high school to Mantua's Roundup Lake Campground. Before Durham and Johnson were varsity teammates, they were a lethal two-on-two team, running the court at Roundup Lake.\n\n\"We used to be the dominant 2v2 pickup,\" Johnson said. \"We used to cook on the 2v2 courts.\"\n\nWhether it was at Roundup Lake or elsewhere, Durham and Johnson have long been connected \u2212 buoyed by the fact that Durham's older brother, James, is in Johnson's class.\n\n\"We have been friends for a very long time,\" Johnson said. \"Me and James played in AAU and that just made our connection even stronger, and then right when [Brody] got [here] last year, his freshman year, we just clicked instantly.\"\n\nThe chemistry is clear for the Red Devils.\n\nIt helps that Brody Durham loves to pass, including to Johnson and, of course, his older brother \u2212 with James Durham in the midst of his own breakout campaign at 13.0 points and 9.1 rebounds per game.\n\nThe whole team seems to savor sharing the ball. The Red Devils are averaging 15.9 assists, with Brody Durham, Jake Eyerman, Johnson and Schweickert all above 1.5.\n\n\"We're really, really blessed to have the kids be [as] connected as they are,\" Jakacki said. \"They truly love playing with each other, for each other. They believe in one another and they don't really care who gets the limelight or who gets the headlines because they know it's a 'we over me' thing. I know that sounds cliche, but we've told the kids from day one everyone's role is different, but their status is the same, so there's no one bigger piece than the other, like it all kind of fits together.\"",

            "content": "The House Republicans have been so dysfunctional over the last few years that once mundane tasks are celebrated like major milestones. Every speaker vote from 1925 through 2021 ended in one ballot. But after the intra-GOP wars of the 118th Congress, Mike Johnson\u2019s reelection Friday \u2014 with just one, messy, vote \u2014 was hailed as a win, and a sign that the fractured caucus could come together in the 119th.\n\n\u201cWe just elected a speaker of the House and we got Republicans on board. So there\u2019s a path,\u201d Rep. Andrew Ogles (R-Tennessee), one of the far-right lawmakers who have needled Johnson, told reporters after the vote.\n\nBut there are perhaps more signs that the speaker vote was just the first fight in a long battle between a far-right faction of about 20 conservatives and the more establishment-leaning Republicans who want to govern in a more traditional or pragmatic way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMake no mistake about it, there are things that will be, in fact, red lines that we need to deliver on,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), one of the last conservative Republican holdouts to vote for Johnson, told reporters.\n\nRepublican moderates, feeling emboldened after winning close elections that kept Republicans in the majority, are ready to take on the likes of Roy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired of it. We\u2019re tired of being nice,\u201d Rep. Don Bacon (R-Nebraska) said Friday. \u201cWe dealt with these guys for three years, and we have very little tolerance or patience. And you could see a little bit of that today.\u201d\n\nThis conflict will play out as House Republicans try to push ahead with legislation to impose strict migration laws and fund President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s long-sought border wall, along with the bid to slash taxes on the wealthy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven that Johnson\u2019s caucus will range in size from 217 to 220 over the next year, he will have only one or two GOP votes to spare to hit a majority, as every Democrat is expected to oppose these measures just as they all voted against Johnson for speaker Friday.\n\nJust like Friday\u2019s vote \u2014 which ran almost an extra hour as Trump and Johnson tried to twist Republican arms \u2014 Johnson will need more than 99 percent unity to get those plans across the finish line.\n\nBut Congress is staring down several must-pass items in the next six months or so that will almost certainly end up requiring significant Democratic support.\n\nWith just 53 Republicans in the Senate, that chamber\u2019s rules requiring a 60-vote hurdle to end debate on most legislation mandates Democratic votes there. Those will be needed on funding federal agencies and lifting the Treasury\u2019s borrowing limit, both of which must be acted upon by mid-March and the late spring or early summer, respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Johnson\u2019s math problem in the House has little to do with the Senate filibuster. Roughly a dozen or more hard-line conservatives refuse to vote for government spending and lifting the debt limit, no matter who is president. Unless those far-right lawmakers change their tune, Johnson will be forced to negotiate with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (New York) for Democratic support. And when Johnson does that, the legislation will include Democratic priorities that drive Roy and a couple dozen members of the House Freedom Caucus politically apoplectic.\n\nJohnson faced that precise dilemma just before Christmas when he took a simple extension of government funding and negotiated a sprawling set of policy riders that Democrats and Republicans alike had been seeking.\n\nConservatives and even establishment Republicans blew up after the roughly 1,500-page package was released, which eventually got trimmed to a less ambitious bill. \u201cWe can have no more of the nonsense that happened before Christmas,\u201d Roy said Friday, referencing the funding bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo formalize their demands, 11 Freedom Caucus members issued a letter with proclamations that range from aspirational (increasing the number of legislative work days) to the next-to-impossible (\u201csecure the border to stop the flow of illegal aliens completely\u201d).\n\nIt served as a thinly veiled threat that Johnson could end up like Kevin McCarthy, who got tossed aside after less than nine months as speaker in a dispute over living up to the private deals he brokered to claim the gavel.\n\n\u201cIf anything happens like happened before, right before Christmas, there will be consequences for that,\u201d Roy told reporters.\n\nAdd in Rep. Thomas Massie (Kentucky), the lone Republican who refused to vote for Johnson, and that\u2019s a dozen far-right members who have put Johnson on notice that he is walking on a very short political leash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo keep power, Johnson may need Trump to keep serving as a unifying force who demands that lawmakers stay loyal to his choice for speaker and help pass key legislation.\n\nThe optimistic Republican view relies almost entirely on Trump to continue serving as a unifying force who demands that everyone falls in line behind his choice for speaker, as well as key legislation.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s going to be different having President Trump in the executive office,\u201d Rep. Elijah Crane (R-Arizona), a Freedom Caucus member, said leaving the House floor.\n\nBut Trump has a tendency to fixate on only a handful of policy areas such as border security and tariffs and to delegate other issues that Johnson probably will need to cut the type of deals with Democrats that anger critics such as Roy.\n\nOne of Johnson\u2019s predecessors, then-Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wisconsin), learned this lesson during Trump\u2019s first two years in office when Republicans also controlled both the House and Senate. Ryan frequently had to negotiate agency funding bills with members of the Appropriations Committee, congressional leaders and Trump aides, deals the president supported but which drew staunch opposition from Freedom Caucus members.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan had a big majority, with a cushion of more than 20 seats, so rebellions back then were mostly just noise. Now, under the rules approved Friday, a small group of nine could oust Johnson.\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen what the attitude of the dissidents is,\u201d Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Kentucky), the dean of the House and senior member of the committee, said. \u201cWe have people on our side who won\u2019t vote for any appropriations bills. So, yeah, we\u2019re not out of the woods yet.\u201d\n\nBacon, who won a district that Vice President Kamala Harris won by almost 5 percentage points, suggested Johnson and Trump need to isolate these far-right members.\n\n\u201cNobody could do better than Johnson. None of these guys offered an alternative. And so they\u2019re just \u2026 ,\u201d he said, pausing to find the right description. \u201cThey like to piss on their own team. That\u2019s what goes on, and they feel good about it. And then they\u2019re mad when we don\u2019t perform well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnson\u2019s dissident faction, in allowing him to win Friday\u2019s vote, might have calculated that the mercurial Trump will grow frustrated with the slow pace of his agenda on Capitol Hill and seek to blame Johnson for the failures.\n\nThe final holdouts at Friday\u2019s speaker vote made clear that they were working to support Trump\u2019s agenda, not oppose him.\n\n\u201cThis was about how we support President Trump, as the House with a very narrow majority,\u201d Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas), who initially voted for another Republican, said afterward. \u201cHow is that going to happen?\u201d\n\nSelf said he spoke twice to the president-elect Friday, including during the hour-long pause in the vote when Johnson was two votes short of the 218 needed to win an outright majority.\n\nTrump never threatened him or Rep. Ralph Norman (R-South Carolina), who was also on the phone with him, according to Self, declining to elaborate on the details of their talk. Eventually, Norman and Self went to the House well and switched their votes to Johnson, giving him the majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoy, who was one of six far-right Republicans who initially did not cast a vote during the alphabetic roll call, said Johnson persuaded him that a vote for him was a vote for enacting Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Johnson contends that in an environment where we have the White House and the Republican Senate, that he\u2019s going to be able to go get the job done. So we\u2019ll give him a chance,\u201d he said.\n\nThat chance came with a warning. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for any excuses now,\u201d Roy said. \u201cQuick, you know it when you see it.\u201d",

            "content": "The new Congress got off to a stumbling start Friday, as Mike Johnson initially appeared to fall short of winning the speakership on the first ballot, before some last-minute arm-bending convinced two Republican holdouts to switch their votes. Johnson was elected speaker with 218 votes, the bare minimum.\n\nStarting the year off this way highlights the difficulties Republicans can expect in mustering majorities to pass legislation in the 119th Congress. The party holds just 219 House seats to Democrats\u2019 215, the smallest majority in nearly a century. Not even President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement of Johnson earlier this week, which he reiterated in a social media post Friday morning, managed to secure an easy path.\n\nKentucky\u2019s Thomas Massie, who had already vowed to vote against Johnson heading into Friday, cast a ballot for the No. 3 House Republican Tom Emmer.\n\nThe floor broke out in murmurs as he was joined by Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Keith Self of Texas, who voted for Ohio\u2019s Jim Jordan and Florida\u2019s Byron Donalds, respectively. Johnson then appeared likely to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, and need multiple ballots to win the gavel.\n\nBut Republicans held the vote open while GOP leaders huddled with Norman and Self. Both lawmakers also spoke to Trump by phone after their initial votes against Johnson.\n\nMore than half an hour later, the pair returned to the chamber, shook hands with Johnson and changed their votes, to applause from their colleagues.\n\nJohnson said after the vote that he had promised the pair \u201cnothing.\u201d Self declined to get into the specifics of his conversation with Johnson and with other Republican colleagues.\n\n\u201cWe had a talk about how we advance the Trump agenda. That\u2019s what this was about,\u201d the Texas lawmaker told reporters about his floor discussions with lawmakers. \u201cI\u2019ll say it a dozen more times, but this was about how we support President Trump as a House with a very narrow majority. How\u2019s that gonna happen?\u201d\n\nNorman told reporters that there \u201cwasn\u2019t any quid pro quo,\u201d adding that Johnson agreed to prioritize a list of topics \u201cthat he knew where we stood,\u201d including the budget and the border.\n\n\u201cWas taking another hour in here worth it? Absolutely,\u201d the South Carolina Republican said.\n\nNorman also said his conversation with Trump wasn\u2019t what moved the needle for him, as he already knew where the president-elect stood.\n\nJohnson had spent the week trying to corral his conference, earning the support of Republican holdouts like Victoria Spartz of Indiana, Eli Crane of Arizona and Greg Steube of Florida. Another potential defector, Tim Burchett of Tennessee, warned on the social media platform X that the election would \u201cgo to multiple rounds,\u201d but then voted for Johnson.\n\nAllies of Freedom Caucus member Chip Roy had said earlier in the week they could be swayed if Johnson appointed the Texas Republican chairman of the Rules Committee.\n\nRoy drew surprised gasps from the chamber when he ultimately voted for Johnson after initially declining to vote when his name was called. A handful of other Republicans likewise chose not to vote when the clerk first called their names, but then voted for Johnson at the end.\n\nFollowing the vote, Roy and 10 other Freedom Caucus members sent a letter to their House Republican colleagues saying they voted for Johnson \u201cbecause of our steadfast support of President Trump and to ensure the timely certification of his electors\u201d on Jan. 6, when the House and Senate meet in a joint session.\n\n\u201cWe did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the Speaker\u2019s track record over the past 15 months,\u201d the lawmakers wrote, while also making specific legislative demands, including on border security, spending, reversing certain Biden-era policies and election security.\n\nUnifying the conference\n\nJohnson\u2019s detractors \u2014 including several who voted for him Friday \u2014 have said he\u2019s done too little to restrain spending, decrying deals struck with Democrats to fund the government and provide more military aid to Ukraine. But in the previous Congress, Johnson was forced to negotiate with Democrats, who controlled the Senate, and the Biden White House. Going forward, Republicans will enjoy a governing trifecta for the first time since the start of Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nAhead of the vote Friday, Johnson was formally nominated by GOP Conference Chair Lisa McClain, who projected confidence.\n\n\u201cAs chairman of the unified Republican conference, I can say proudly that we are ready to govern,\u201d the Michigan congresswoman said, betraying no hints of the behind-the-scenes discord. Throughout her remarks, most Republicans stood to applaud repeatedly, while Roy sat stone-faced.\n\nIn his remarks nominating Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar needled the GOP\u2019s difficulties coming together. \u201cThere\u2019s only one leader who knows how to negotiate a bipartisan deal and then stick to that deal,\u201d the California Democrat said.\n\nJohnson could face more hiccups in the coming year, as he works to tame the various factions of his party and retain Trump\u2019s blessing.\n\nThe president-elect\u2019s popularity with the GOP base and his willingness to endorse primary challengers to Republicans who defy him means that most in the caucus have not opposed him when the spotlight is on. But despite Trump\u2019s public pressure to eliminate the debt ceiling amid last month\u2019s budget showdown, Roy and 37 other Republicans voted against the proposal, saying the now-frequent flirtation with national default provided them leverage to reduce federal spending. The debt ceiling will need to be raised again some time in the coming few months.\n\nCongressional Republicans have turned on their leaders repeatedly in recent years. Speaker John Boehner faced a revolt from right-wing members that ultimately contributed to his decision to step down in 2015.\n\nAs for McCarthy, his post lasted less than a year after he struck a spending deal with Democrats, which led then-Rep. Matt Gaetz to force a no-confidence vote. It took Republicans weeks to eventually land on Johnson as a new speaker, and the 118th Congress ended up being one of the least productive in living memory. The proposed House rules for the new Congress would raise the threshold to file a motion to vacate the speaker\u2019s chair from one member to nine majority-party members.\n\nA festive mood\n\nAfter the voting drama ended Friday, Jeffries and Johnson took to the rostrum to lay out their competing visions for the coming Congress.\n\n\u201cThe American people need us, in this season, to put down our partisan swords and pick up bipartisan plowshares,\u201d Jeffries said, pleading with Republicans to work across the aisle.\n\nJohnson opened his remarks by asking for a moment of silence in honor of the victims of the New Year\u2019s Eve attack in New Orleans that left 15 dead, before outlining an \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda. He pledged to immediately crack down on immigration and \u201cfinally finish the border wall,\u201d and then to \u201cgive relief to Americans and extend the Trump tax cuts.\u201d He also vowed to repeal Biden-era green energy subsidies, protect domestic industry from foreign competition, and to \u201croll back the totalitarian fourth branch of government known as the administrative state.\u201d\n\nEven as the 119th Congress kicked off with uncertainty over the speakership, the mood inside and outside the chamber was festive and light. Members hobnobbed and waved at their guests watching from the galleries above, while their children \u2014 allowed to join them on the floor \u2014 squirmed with varying levels of boredom.\n\nAs Democrats were snapping selfies and introducing themselves to one another before the vote, things on the other side of the aisle were decidedly more solemn. Facing another apparent round of infighting before the C-SPAN cameras, much of the Republican rank-and-file sat grimly. But when Johnson returned to the floor smiling, it became clear he would prevail.\n\nThe successful dodging of a drawn-out speaker fight drew kudos from Trump, who called Johnson\u2019s election an \u201cunprecedented Vote of Confidence in Congress.\u201c\n\n\u201cMike will be a Great Speaker, and our Country will be the beneficiary,\u201c the president-elect said on his Truth Social platform.\n\nDavid Lerman, Nina Heller, Justin Papp, John T. Bennett, Jacob Fulton, Mark Schoeff Jr., Daniel Hillburn, Olivia Bridges and Aidan Quigley contributed to this report.\n\nThis report and headline have been updated.",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nWith two Republican lawmakers standing between Mike Johnson and the speaker\u2019s gavel, President-elect Donald Trump picked up the phone.\n\nFrom the golf course Friday afternoon, he spoke to Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Keith Self of Texas and convinced them to ultimately fall in line behind Johnson.\n\nWithout a vote to spare, the Louisiana Republican won his bid to retain the gavel and lead a narrowly divided chamber into the new year. While the official record will state he secured the necessary 218 votes on the first try, the drama unfolded with far less certainty and demanded Trump\u2019s intervention until the very end. The first vote of the 119th Congress underscored the president-elect\u2019s hold over the Republican Party \u2013 and the challenge he faces keeping it together over the next two years ahead of the 2026 midterms, which could threaten the GOP\u2019s Washington trifecta.\n\nTrump, according to two sources familiar with the pitch, argued that Republicans needed to work as a team and warned that voters would have very little tolerance for the dysfunction that would ensue if Republicans could not unite behind a speaker.\n\n\u201cThe message was that he wants what everyone else wants: his agenda to pass,\u201d Self said of his conversation with Trump before he switched his vote in favor of Johnson. \u201cAnd that was my message to him, Mr. President, we need a strong negotiating team. The message was clear.\u201d\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, one of a half dozen conservative hardliners who initially withheld support from Johnson, told CNN after the vote that he still had reservations with House leadership, but Trump\u2019s confidence in Johnson had swayed the GOP conference.\n\n\u201cI have concerns, but President Trump said he wanted to work with Johnson, and basically, basically, we took that into account,\u201d the Arizona Republican said leaving the House floor.\n\nAsked if he believes Johnson would\u2019ve survived without Trump\u2019s endorsement, Biggs said, \u201cNo. I think it was important.\u201d\n\nJohnson himself stressed that Trump\u2019s endorsement \u2013 delivered on Monday \u2013 was \u201ca big factor\u201d in the contest, saying that \u201chis voice and his influence are of singular influence.\u201d Trump had initially planned to endorse him on New Year\u2019s Day, however, the congressman suggested he should do it sooner, he told a local Baton Rouge radio station earlier this week. By Friday morning, Trump and his team were fully hands-on in helping Johnson land the votes. Besides the president-elect speaking directly to defectors, one of Trump\u2019s closest Hill allies, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, was seen on the phone with Trump\u2019s incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles in the middle of the vote.\n\nTrump had made clear all week that a drawn-out fight could undermine confidence in the Republican takeover of Washington and perhaps end with an inexperienced leader in charge of steering his agenda through the House. Trump signaled his willingness to personally lobby Johnson\u2019s skeptics, a step he was unwilling to take during previous House GOP leadership skirmishes.\n\nA key early test for Trump\n\nStill, the episode served as another reminder that Trump faces an uphill battle governing over the next two years, even with Republicans controlling the White House and Congress.\n\nWith narrow majorities in the House and Senate, Trump needs nearly unanimous support from his party \u2013 or bipartisan help \u2013 or he risks failing to fulfill the wholesale change he promised voters he was uniquely positioned to deliver. The margin in the House will only tighten if the Senate confirms Reps. Mike Waltz of Florida and Elise Stefanik of New York to serve in the administration as national security adviser and United Nations ambassador, respectively.\n\nThe difficulty ahead is informed in part by how House Republicans have struggled since winning back the majority in the 2022.\n\n\u201cGoverning is messy sometimes,\u201d Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told CNN. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019ve proven that not only today, but over the last two years. But we\u2019ll get there.\u201d\n\nAlready, Trump has confronted the limitations of his reach within his own party. Before the holiday break, he unsuccessfully pressured House Republicans to raise the country\u2019s borrowing limit during a funding vote that took the government perilously close to a shutdown.\n\nHis allies also failed to influence the vote to name the next Senate majority leader, a job won by South Dakota Sen. John Thune, an erstwhile critic of the incoming president. Nor could Trump sway Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to name his daughter-in-law Lara Trump to the Senate seat that currently belongs to Marco Rubio, the president-elect\u2019s pick for secretary of state. And Trump abandoned a bid to make former Rep. Matt Gaetz his attorney general in the face of strong opposition from Senate Republicans.\n\nBut getting Johnson over the finish line marked a key early test for Trump\u2019s ability to navigate a closely divided chamber where individual lawmakers know they will wield incredible power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a dicey run for this House Republican majority, just to be fair about it,\u201d said former Rep. Patrick McHenry, who for 22 days oversaw the last GOP speakership fight as speaker pro tempore. \u201cBut it\u2019s enabled and (Johnson\u2019s) speakership is enabled by having President Donald Trump in office. And without Donald Trump, this vote might have been a different outcome.\u201d\n\nLeading up to the vote, Trump expressed confidence Johnson would win, telling CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes that he didn\u2019t have any other names in mind for the job should the Louisiana Republican falter.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson delivers remarks after being reelected to the speakership in the House chamber at the Capitol on January 3. Francis Chung/Politico/AP\n\nJohnson and his allies knew there was no real path to another Republican being elected. The only question was how many ballots it would take to get there \u2014 and how much Trump himself would need to lean on the skeptics.\n\nEven as the vote began, senior members of GOP leadership didn\u2019t know exactly how the vote would go. Out of three lawmakers who opposed Johnson on the floor, only Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky had informed leadership he would oppose the speaker. Self, one of the initial defectors, came entirely out of left field, as one person described it.\n\nAnd while Trump and Johnson had clashed over the spending bill in December, the president-elect and his team quickly realized they needed to help squeeze the rest of the GOP conference to avoid drama going into inauguration.\n\n\u201cHe had a lot of influence,\u201d said House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole of Oklahoma. \u201cWe had 20 odd people last time that weren\u2019t there on the first ballot. We had three and they got there.\u201d\n\nJohnson resisted giveaways\n\nBesides Trump\u2019s influence, perhaps most notable in the whole ordeal was Johnson\u2019s insistence that he would land the votes without the usual commitments made by speakers of both parties \u2014 the promise of plum committee slots or certain bills coming to the floor.\n\nJohnson said one of the ways he won over GOP holdouts was by reupping his commitment to empower individual lawmakers in the 119th Congress, but offered no giveaways to curry votes.\n\n\u201cI was already committed to that, so I just reaffirmed,\u201d he said when asked about some of the hardliners\u2019 push for more member empowerment.\n\nThis offers Johnson far more room to operate, politically, over the next two years in one of the narrowest House majorities in history. And the approach stands in stark contrast to his predecessor Kevin McCarthy, whose tradeoffs with his detractors ultimately helped derail his speakership.\n\nJohnson\u2019s allies cheered his willingness to stand up to the GOP hardliners, without alienating them.\n\n\u201cWhen you surrender to your hostage takers, you lose control of your, in this case, political soul,\u201d long-time Rep. Frank Lucas of Oklahoma told CNN.\n\nKey members of the House Freedom Caucus spent days laying out demands to Johnson, such as spending cuts or reforms to the appropriations process. And even after Johnson clinched the gavel, a group of House Republicans released a letter outlining a list of demands they want him to take up.\n\n\u201cToday we voted for Mike Johnson for Speaker of the House because of our steadfast support of President Trump and to ensure the timely certification of his electors,\u201d 11 GOP lawmakers wrote. \u201cWe did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the Speaker\u2019s track record over the last 15 months.\u201d\n\nBut the speaker ultimately made no policy guarantee or committee adjustments that would upset the rest of the conference.\n\nJohnson, for example, refused to consider Rep. Chip Roy of Texas as chair of the powerful House Rules panel, which would have allowed him to amend language and determine how it comes to the floor.\n\nInstead, Johnson released a statement saying he would create a working group on implementing spending reforms \u2014 working with Trump\u2019s new Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 that will issue a public report related to government agency audits. He also said that he would \u201crequest\u201d committees look deeply into government agencies or individuals who have \u201cweaponized government against the American people.\u201d\n\nAnd many conservatives were clear that they would not rubber stamp Trump\u2019s agenda through the House and expected the chance to weigh in.\n\n\u201cWe still got work to do. This is the beginning. This isn\u2019t the end,\u201d said Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, who had initially received a vote in the speaker\u2019s race before it changed to Johnson.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kit Maher and Kristen Holmes contributed to this report.",

            "content": "Politics / There Is No Genuine Good News for Mike Johnson Yes, he won the House speakership, after 1.5 attempts. But he still doesn\u2019t control his chamber.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson delivers remarks after being reelected Speaker on the first day of the 119th Congress.\n\n(Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images)\n\n\u201cYou can start cutting off my fingers. I am not voting for Mike Johnson tomorrow,\u201d Representative Thomas Massie told disgraced former representative Matt Gaetz, the brand-new anchor at wing-nut One America News Thursday night. The Kentucky conservative\u2019s bloody imagery foreshadowed the ritualistic torture Johnson\u2019s skeptics hoped to inflict before giving him back the speaker\u2019s gavel. The dozen or so possible holdouts, who didn\u2019t take as strong an opposition line as Massie but didn\u2019t pledge their support either, seemed to want to symbolically snip off one or two of Johnson\u2019s fingers before pledging their support. They demanded deals Johnson said he wouldn\u2019t make.\n\nIn fact, Johnson came into the meeting Friday saying he was confident he\u2019d win on the first vote, losing only the implacable Massie, who voted for Tom Emmer as promised\u2014the only vote he could afford to lose. The former (at that point) speaker was wrong, by my count. He lost two more: South Carolinian Representative Ralph Norman, who voted for Ohio extremist Representative Jim Jordan, and Texas Representative Ralph Self, who voted for Florida Representative Byron Donalds. Six Freedom Caucus members declined to vote when called; all voted for Johnson when called at the end.\n\nAs in every other speaker vote, all Democrats voted for minority leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nBut ultimately, it didn\u2019t matter. Johnson was smart enough not to gavel the session closed and went off to cajole and arm-twist Norman and Self. At one point, he left the chamber hanging his head, then remembered the cameras and looked up and waved. Good optics.\n\nWe still don\u2019t know how Johnson got those two to change sides. Probably by making promises he can\u2019t keep. Officially, the House proceeded to vote open voting again, Norman and Self changed their votes, and Johnson\u2019s opponents didn\u2019t get the chance to cut off a figurative finger or two.\n\nThat we know of.\n\nPeople are calling it a first-vote victory. I\u2019d say he won on vote 1.5.\n\nSometimes-smart MSNBC contributor Brendan Buck, who worked with doomed former GOP speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan, insisted that merely losing three votes, then getting two back, was good news for Johnson. Maybe. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any good news for Johnson beyond today.\n\nCertainly Johnson benefited from the fact that no Republicans ran against him, and President-elect Donald Trump enthusiastically supported him. But Trump also set up some of Johnson\u2019s once and future suffering by pulling three members out of the GOP caucus to serve in his cabinet. The embattled speaker will continue to have to rely on Democrats to pass legislation. Which makes it more likely that, despite Friday\u2019s victory, Johnson won\u2019t survive his term.\n\nStill, we should call this Trump\u2019s first victory of his co-presidency with Elon Musk. We know Musk helped strike down the bipartisan continuing resolution to keep the government open last year, before Trump weighed in with his own reservations.",

            "content": "House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) won his second election to lead the chamber on Friday. And he did so with a little drama \u2014 but less than some people were anticipating. With Johnson being able to spare only one Republican vote in the closely divided House, several Republicans withheld their support in the run-up to the vote. And three members initially voted against him \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie (Kentucky), Ralph Norman (South Carolina) and Keith Self (Texas).\n\nBut after the vote was held open for a while, Norman and Self ultimately changed their vote to Johnson, giving him the 218 votes he needed and reelecting him on the first ballot.\n\nBelow are some takeaways from what just happened.\n\n1. A big win for Johnson\n\nThe fact that Johnson apparently came so close to losing on the first ballot is no small thing; it would have been just the third time that happened in the past 100 years. And the vote reinforces trouble ahead, for reasons I\u2019ll get to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a number of other ways, Johnson\u2019s win is a pretty impressive accomplishment.\n\nFor one, both of the other two modern examples of speaker nominees initially failing came in the past two years; this is just what the Republican Party is these days.\n\nFor another, Johnson has the second smallest majority in the history of Congress, meaning he had considerably less margin for error than your average speaker.\n\nHowever we arrived at the conclusion, losing only one GOP vote in today\u2019s Republican Party is a pretty remarkable achievement. The party isn\u2019t that unified on much of anything. And it\u2019s relatively impressive even outside the GOP. Indeed, the last speaker to be elected without any defections from his or her party at the start of a Congress was John A. Boehner in 2011. (Johnson\u2019s one defector matches Paul D. Ryan\u2019s total in 2017.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Johnson had a bigger majority, it\u2019s likely we\u2019d have seen more defections. It\u2019s a lot easier to cast a protest vote than to be the one to defeat your party\u2019s nominee. But getting all but one Republican to fall in line these days is no small task, regardless of the other variables.\n\n2. Trump\u2019s win played a huge role\n\nJohnson can also thank Donald Trump and GOP Senate candidates for making this relatively painless.\n\nRepublicans flipping the presidency and the Senate in the 2024 election meant there was considerably less appetite for upheaval at this juncture. The party now has an opportunity to govern and implement its agenda, and starting off with a fierce internecine battle probably wasn\u2019t what even many Johnson holdouts really wanted.\n\nIf Republicans didn\u2019t have that kind of power, you can bet there would have been more urgency behind either turning the page on Johnson or forcing him to make major concessions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, there was the complicating matter that Congress is due to certify Trump\u2019s win on Monday. A drawn-out battle could have complicated or delayed that in ways Trump surely wouldn\u2019t have liked.\n\nJohnson was certainly bolstered by Trump endorsing him in recent days and actually going to bat for him \u2014 which Trump doesn\u2019t always do \u2014 by talking to the holdouts and pressing the case publicly for Johnson.\n\nThat made clear to the holdouts that they could be blamed for standing in Trump\u2019s way, which few Republicans have an appetite for right now.\n\n3. The holdouts still sent a message\n\nThe process by which Johnson won shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed \u2014 and surely won\u2019t by Johnson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the quirks of the speaker vote was not just that two members wound up flipping their votes, but that six potential holdouts didn\u2019t initially respond when their name was called. (Those six also ultimately voted for Johnson.)\n\nCombine those six with the three who initially voted against Johnson, and that\u2019s nine Republicans who at least registered some reservations about backing Johnson. And as my colleague Leigh Ann Caldwell noted to me, that number is telling. The new rules package for the House make that the number of GOP members who can force a vote to remove the speaker. (When Kevin McCarthy was removed in late 2023, just one member could force such a vote.)\n\nSince the vote, these nine and other Republicans have re-upped many of their concerns with Johnson and called for a new way of doing business, making clear that their support isn\u2019t a blank check.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne such letter from 11 members of the House Freedom Caucus said that they voted for Johnson \u201cbecause of our steadfast support of President Trump and to ensure the timely certification of his electors.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the Speaker\u2019s track record over the past 15 months,\u201d the members said.\n\nIn other words: Don\u2019t celebrate too hard.\n\n4. This isn\u2019t the end of Johnson\u2019s problems\n\nIt\u2019s quite possible we\u2019ll look back on this in the very near future as only a momentary thawing of the frosty internal GOP relations that have characterized Johnson\u2019s 15 months as speaker.\n\nThat\u2019s because the fundamental problems he has haven\u2019t really changed, even if Trump\u2019s and the GOP\u2019s 2024 wins have papered over them and injected some more unifying dynamics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans still face the intractable problem that is some members of their conference wanting to cut spending \u2014 a lot of it \u2014 but that being very difficult, especially with such a tiny majority. And the fact that Trump did the opposite during his first term, sending spending soaring.\n\nRepublicans are also continually divided between an establishment, pragmatic wing of the party and the more MAGA-aligned elements that don\u2019t have as much concern about party unity and their broader party\u2019s electoral fortunes \u2014 and plenty of concern about attention-seeking.\n\nWhat happens, for example, if Trump really pushes hard for Congress to get rid of the debt ceiling without major spending cuts? What happens when these members threaten a shutdown over spending cuts and Johnson again needs the votes of Democrats to keep the government functioning? What happens when Johnson tries to pass something pragmatic (like on border security) that can overcome a Democratic filibuster in the Senate?\n\nPerhaps Trump can help mend some of those fences, as he has here. But he\u2019s also shown precious little interest over the years in the nitty gritty of congressional dealmaking \u2014 and precious little loyalty to people like Johnson.",

Thomas Massie, R-Ky., voted for Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., cast his ballot for Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas, supported Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. But Norman and Self changed their votes, bringing the final tally to 218-215.\n\nReports indicate it was Trump who called and changed the two lawmakers\u2019 minds.\n\nSeveral members of Congress were holding children or grandchildren as they voted. Families often join lawmakers on the first day of the session.\n\n\u201cWe have to get this job done and unify the Congress,\u201d Johnson, who has held the job since October 2023, told reporters ahead of the vote. \u201cI\u2019m here for the long haul.\u201d\n\nUtah reps support Johnson\n\nAll four Utah representatives supported Johnson, as the Deseret News previously reported, including Utah\u2019s newest congressmen, Rep.-elect Mike Kennedy.\n\nRep. Blake Moore, R-Utah, the vice chair of the House Republican Conference, said forcing Johnson out \u201cwould be nothing short of dishonest.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing Speaker of the House against an opposing senate majority leader and White House is the most difficult job in American politics, and Johnson has done a superb job handling every angle,\u201d Moore said.\n\nWhat are Speaker Johnson\u2019s promises?\n\nJohnson is the 56th Speaker of the House of Representatives. He addressed the lower chamber following the vote after Jeffries handed Johnson the gavel as a symbol of a peaceful transfer of power. The two representatives shook hands.\n\nJohnson called for a moment of silence for the recent tragedy that occurred in his home state of Louisiana, where a pickup truck drove into a crowd, killing 14 people and injuring dozens.\n\n\u201cOf course, these are difficult days in our home state of Louisiana, where I come from,\u201d Johnson said in the House. \u201cWe all know about the terrorist attack in New Orleans and it\u2019s really shaken our state. People are reeling from that attack.\u201d\n\nHe was joined by his wife, Kelly, and their four children. Johnson said he\u2019s observing a \u201creally remarkable political moment in our modern history\u201d as voters across the country showed they are interested in putting America first. \u201cAnd we will,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis Congress will renounce the status quo, and we will listen to the voices of the people. We will act quickly, and we will start by defending our nation\u2019s borders,\u201d the speaker said. \u201cThat\u2019s the number one goal.\u201d\n\nAfter reading Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Prayer for the Nation, Johnson said, \u201cWe will not fail. We cannot fail. We are all in this together. Our nation is counting on us to band together and solve these problems and get this done,\u201d as CNN reported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said before that I believe God has elevated each one of you, that is my belief, to your positions of leadership and it\u2019s an act of providence that you\u2019ve all been placed in your specific roles in this specific moment at this historic time.\u201d\n\nTrump congratulated Johnson on Truth Social. \u201cThe People of America have waited four years for Common Sense, Strength, and Leadership,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThey\u2019ll get it now and America will be greater than ever before.\u201d\n\nIn a post in X ahead of the vote, Johnson made three commitments as speaker. He promised to create a working group of independent experts to work with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and House committees to implement recommendations on reducing government spending. The working group will also audit existing federal agencies and issue a report that will be released by the speaker\u2019s office, he added. Lastly, Johnson said he would request House committees to tackle the misuse of taxpayer funds.\n\n\u201cAlong with advancing President Trump\u2019s America First agenda, I will lead the House Republicans to reduce the size and scope of the federal government, hold the bureaucracy accountable, and move the United States to a more sustainable fiscal trajectory,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nJohnson overcame tough challenge\n\nIn recent weeks, many in Congress voiced their concerns about whether Johnson was the right person to be speaker, especially during an opportunistic time when the Senate, the House and the White House are under GOP control. They questioned his ability to further Republican priorities without giving in to too many demands from Democrats.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement of Johnson calmed some doubts, while his phone calls to certain members helped solidify unified support behind Johnson. But a question still loomed: Would Trump\u2019s backing be enough for Johnson to win the speakership in the first round?\n\nIn a post on Truth Social Friday, Trump said, \u201cGood luck today for Speaker Mike Johnson, a fine man of great ability, who is very close to having 100% support.\u201d\n\n\u201cA win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party, and yet another acknowledgment of our 129 year most consequential Presidential Election!!\u201d he added.\n\nFormer Rep. Matt Gaetz resigned from the 119th Congress ahead of the vote, lowering the GOP majority to 219-215. Johnson needed at least 218 votes to retain his gavel, so he could only lose one Republican vote without any Democratic support.\n\nMassie didn\u2019t budge from his criticism of Johnson, and was the lone Republican vote against the speaker.\n\n\u201cYou can pull all my fingernails out; you can shove bamboo up in them; you can start cutting off my fingers,\u201d Massie told Gaetz, who is now a host for One America News, in an interview Thursday, as The Guardian reported. \u201cI am not voting for Mike Johnson tomorrow, and you can take that to the bank.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story said Johnson won on a second ballot. He won on the first ballot after two Republican lawmakers changed their votes to support Johnson.",

The Louisiana Republican has the support...\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The 119th Congress is convening for the first time and House Speaker Mike Johnson has narrowly been reelected to his post. The Louisiana Republican has the support of President-elect Donald Trump and House Republicans decided on Friday to reelect him to his post with just one holdout.\n\nTexas Rep. Keith Self, Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman all voted against Johnson during the initial vote. Self and Norman switched their vote to Johnson after speaking with him away from cameras. Far-right Republicans have at times grown frustrated with Johnson\u2019s leadership and are prone to demanding concessions when their votes become essential.\n\nHere\u2019s the latest:\n\nTrump called 3 holdouts who were opposed to Johnson as speaker\n\nRep. Ralph Norman, a Republican who switched his vote to Johnson after initially opposing him, said the president-elect\u2019s argument was simple: \u201cMike\u2019s the only one who can be elected.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s phone calls \u2014 first with Norman, then with all three GOP lawmakers who had opposed Johnson \u2014 eventually helped convince them to change their votes.\n\nNorman said that what changed his mind was Johnson\u2019s \u201cassurance that he was going to fight for everything going forward.\u201d\n\nJohnson takes the oath of office\n\nHe was officially sworn in as Speaker of the House by Rep. Hal Rogers of Kentucky, the longest-serving member of the House.\n\nCheers erupted in the House chamber after lawmakers took their oaths of office and were officially sworn in as members of Congress.\n\nHouse conserv\n\natives back Johnson \u2014 for now\n\nMike Johnson is taking back the speaker\u2019s gavel with support from arch-conservatives, but they are making it clear their continued support is contingent upon ambitious policy goals.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus released a list of legislation demands after its members delivered key votes to make Johnson speaker, including enacting permanent immigration changes, federal spending cuts and banning members of Congress from stock trading.\n\n\u201cThere is always room to negotiate on so-called \u2018leadership\u2019 positions under the rules,\u201d the GOP lawmakers said in their letter.\n\nTrump congratulates Johnson on being reelected House speaker\n\nTrump called Johnson\u2019s reelection an \u201cunprecedented vote of confidence in Congress\u201d in a post on Truth Social.\n\n\u201cThe People of America have waited four years for Common Sense, Strength, and Leadership,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThey\u2019ll get it now and America will be greater than ever before.\u201d\n\nThe President-elect had endorsed Johnson and sent good wishes earlier on Friday ahead of the vote.\n\nA DCCC fundraising email went out a little soon\n\nShortly after 2 p.m., with the vote for House speaker hanging in the balance, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent out a fundraising email announcing that he had fallen short under the subject line: \u201cMike Johnson FIRED?!\u201d\n\n\u201cMike Johnson just LOST his bid to be reelected Speaker\u2026\u201d the solicitation read. \u201cThis is just the beginning of House GOP chaos.\u201d\n\nBut the DCCC post, which sought donations of at least $4 from \u201cevery Democrat reading this\u201d for midterm congressional elections in 2026, went out too quickly.\n\nHouse Republicans left the vote open while negotiations continued with recalcitrant members, and Johnson was narrowly elected on the first ballot.\n\nJeffries hands Johnson the gavel in customary nod to the peaceful transfer of power\n\nThe New York Democrat did the same thing 14 months ago when Johnson was elected speaker after Republicans ousted Kevin McCarthy from the post.\n\n\u2018America is too expensive\u2019\n\nDemocratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries is urging lawmakers to work together to lower the cost of living for Americans and to secure the border.\n\n\u201cAmerica is too expensive,\u201d Jeffries said at one point as he prepared to hand the speaker\u2019s gavel to Republican Rep. Mike Johnson.\n\nAs Democrats applauded loudly, some Republicans chuckled that Jeffries was stressing issues that they made a priority in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWhere did the votes for speaker land?\n\n218 for Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La.\n\n215 for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY\n\n1 for Rep. Tom Emmer, R-MN\n\nJohnson reelected\n\nRepublican Mike Johnson has been reelected as Speaker of the House on first ballot, winning over GOP critics to retain the gavel.\n\nEscorting Johnson to the dais are members of his leadership team as well as the entire delegation of his home state of Louisiana.\n\nOnce he arrives, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries will hand him over the gavel as is customary to do, a nod to the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n2 holdouts change their votes\n\nReps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self have changed their votes at the 11th hour, supporting Johnson for speaker.\n\nJohnson stood next to both men in the well and shook their hands after they voted.\n\nSenators sworn in as new Majority Leader John Thune pledges to keep filibuster\n\nIn his first speech as leader, Thune said his priority is to maintain the filibuster, the legislative tactic that allows senators to delay consideration of a measure and require 60 votes for passage.\n\nHe said he will ensure \u201cthe Senate stays the Senate.\u201d\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has called for the elimination of the filibuster in his first term. But Senate Republicans have firmly opposed any changes.\n\nMany Democrats wanted to eliminate it in the early days of President Joe Biden\u2019s term but were stymied by moderates who said it would upend the Senate\u2019s deliberative role.\n\nNine new senators were sworn in \u2014 four Democrats and five Republicans. A sixth Republican, Jim Justice of West Virginia, announced last month that he will wait to enter the Senate until after his successor as the state\u2019s governor, Republican Patrick Morrisey, is sworn in on Jan. 13.\n\nJohnson leads 2 GOP holdouts off House floor\n\nJohnson is two votes down from seizing the gavel in first-round balloting.\n\nHe huddled with several lawmakers and others took phone calls.\n\nTwo of the Republican holdouts, Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Rep. Keith Self of Texas, followed Johnson away from the cameras off the chamber floor.\n\nDonalds: \u2018They\u2019ll figure it out\u2019\n\nFlorida Rep. Byron Donalds, who received one vote for speaker, told a group of reporters outside the chamber that he didn\u2019t see any actual pathway to stepping into the role.\n\nHe projected confidence that his Republican colleagues would sort out how to elect Johnson.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s between those members and Speaker Johnson,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a deal-making town. They\u2019ll make deals. They\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\nRep. Keith Self, R-Texas, voted for Donalds during the first-round roll call instead of Johnson.\n\nSeveral far-right House members head into a private room with Johnson\n\nA huge group of far-right House members \u2014 including the three current detractors \u2014 have entered a private room off the House floor with Mike Johnson.\n\nThe first ballot vote remains open and the chamber remains without a speaker.\n\nDemocrats watch as Republicans fall into disarray, again\n\nHouse Democrats find themselves in a familiar place, watching their colleagues across the aisle battle it out over who will become speaker once again.\n\nMembers laughed and gasped as several Republican lawmakers voted for candidates besides Johnson on the first ballot.\n\nTheir leader, Hakeem Jeffries, posted on social media during the vote, saying, \u201cThe GOP Civil War is in full swing. And it\u2019s only Day 1.\u201d\n\nLawmaker calls attention to US territories during speaker vote\n\nRep. Stacey Plaskett, who represents the U.S. Virgin Islands, received cheers and jeers as she inquired why members of Congress elected by U.S. territories were not included in the roll call for House speaker.\n\n\u201cWe are collectively the largest per capita of veterans in this country,\u201d said Plaskett, who added that the territories are home to more than 4 million American citizens.\n\nThe territories include Plaskett\u2019s home territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands\n\n\u201cWe must do something about this problem,\u201d Plaskett said as she received a standing ovation from her Democratic colleagues and calls for \u201corder\u201d from Republicans across the aisle.\n\nOnly members of Congress elected from U.S. states are eligible to vote for speaker.\n\nJohnson needs 2 more votes to become speaker on this ballot\n\nHis allies are talking to some of the holdouts on the House floor.\n\nJohnson walks off House floor\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson walked off the floor as the first ballot for his speaker\u2019s race was coming to a close.\n\nThree Republicans voted for other candidates besides Johnson.\n\nAnother vote against Johnson\n\nTexas Rep. Keith Self voted for Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida for House Speaker, in lieu of Rep. Mike Johnson.\n\nIt is the third GOP defection from the incumbent speaker.\n\nJohnson at risk of falling short on first ballot\n\nWith Reps. Thomas Massie and Ralph Norman both voting for candidates that are not Johnson, the Louisiana Republican is now at risk of losing his first ballot for speaker.\n\nThere were several far-right members who abstained from voting thus far and could potentially vote at the end.\n\nA former House Speaker votes for her Democratic successor\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi received a standing ovation from her Democratic colleagues when she cast a vote for Jeffries, her successor as Democratic minority leader, to serve as House Speaker.\n\nThe two, sitting across the aisle from each other in the chamber, embraced for a quick hug before voting resumed.\n\nFirst vote against Johnson\n\nKentucky Rep. Thomas Massie kept to his word on Friday in voting against Johnson for speaker on the first roll call vote, voting instead for the No. 3 Republican, Rep. Tom Emmer.\n\nAn alphabetica\n\nl roll call causes a scene during the House vote\n\nReps. Hakeem Jeffries and Mike Johnson received back-to-back standing ovations from their respective sides of the aisle as they each cast votes for themselves to serve as Speaker of the House.\n\nA few of Johnson\u2019s critics have so far abstained from voting\n\nThey are standing in the back row of the chamber. It\u2019s unclear if they will vote at the end of the roll call when the clerk calls their name again.\n\nMcClain urges colleagues not to hold out for perfection\n\nRep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., said achieving perfection requires incremental gains and hard decisions.\n\n\u201cNone of us will get exactly what we want,\u201d she said.\n\nThe message is aimed at some of the most conservative members of the House Republican conference who have come into Friday\u2019s vote without previously committing to Johnson.\n\nThe speaker election has started\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chair Lisa McClain kicked off the speaker election by nominating Mike Johnson to be the speaker for the 119th Congress.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n1. Nominations\n\nOnce the House is in a quorum \u2014 meaning the minimum number of members are present to proceed \u2014 nominating speeches will be made on behalf of the nominees for speaker. Republicans chose Johnson as their nominee for speaker in a closed-door vote in November. A week later, Democrats unanimously chose Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to remain their leader despite the party\u2019s electoral losses.\n\n2. Voting\n\nLawmakers call out the name of their choice for speaker from the floor, a rare and time-consuming roll call. Members often liven up the proceedings by shouting or standing when casting their vote. Lawmakers are not obligated to vote for their party\u2019s nominated candidate. Any name can be called out from the House floor. While it has been the tradition for the speaker to be a member of the House, it is not required.\n\n3. Results\n\nShould Johnson come up short, it is likely the clerk will move immediately to start another roll call vote. If a speaker candidate wins a majority of those present and voting, a bipartisan committee, usually consisting of members from the home state of the chosen candidate, will escort the speaker-elect to the chair on the dais where the oath of office is administered.\n\nSelfies with the next speaker?\n\nAs Johnson\u2019s political fate hangs in the balance, members are using this time to take selfies with the Louisiana Republican.\n\nGOP lawmakers are bringing their babies, grandbabies and siblings to take a photo with the speaker before the House begins his reelection vote.\n\nVoting for the Speaker of the House is soon to begin\n\nThe next speaker must receive a majority of the votes cast. If not, balloting continues until someone meets that threshold.\n\nTwo years ago, it took Kevin McCarthy 15 rounds of balloting before he gained enough support to take the gavel.\n\nThose voting won their election in November, but they cannot take the oath of office until a new speaker has been elected.\n\nColors of the political spectrum\n\nNew and returning lawmakers donned their Sunday best to the first day of the new Congress, with many of the women adhering to the traditional colors of their political party.\n\nRed ties and dresses for Republican members can be seen scattered across the House floor while across the aisle Democratic women styled various shades of blue.\n\nHow many votes does Johnson need to win?\n\nJohnson commands one of the slimmest majorities in modern times, 220-215, having lost seats in the November election.\n\nThe abrupt resignation of Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida drops his tally to 220.\n\nThat leaves him relying on almost every Republican for support in the face of Democratic opposition, though the typical 218 majority needed could shift with absences and others voting only \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\nThe 118th Congress has come to a close\n\nBefore his election for speaker can begin, Speaker Mike Johnson opened Friday\u2019s session by declaring that the 118th Congress has come to a close.\n\nOn his way to the House floor earlier, he was asked by reporters if he will win the speakership during the first round of voting.\n\n\u201cI hope so. We\u2019ll see,\u201d he said.\n\nA festive mood in the House chamber ahead of the speaker vote\n\nLawmakers are quickly filtering into the House chambers for the start of the 119th Congress, where the first order of business will be a quorum call and then a roll call vote to elect the next speaker.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s a festive atmosphere with many lawmakers bringing their children onto the House floor with them to take in some history.\n\nSoon, it will become more serious as the speaker vote is held.\n\nRep. Mike Johnson, R-La., has the backing of President-elect Donald Trump, but can\u2019t afford hardly any holdouts from the Republican side of the room if he hopes to return to holding the gavel.\n\nPelosi arrives in the House chamber\n\nDemocratic lawmakers are standing and applauding as Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi has entered the House chamber as a new Congress begins to gather.\n\nThe former speaker had hip replacement surgery recently at a U.S. military hospital in Germany after falling while at an event in Luxembourg with other members of Congress.\n\nThe former speaker walked gingerly to a seat in the middle of the chamber. Several colleagues moved quickly to greet her.\n\nMembers begin to spill onto the House floor ahead of speaker\u2019s race\n\nNew and returning lawmakers walked around the chamber, taking selfies with their children and families ahead of what is expected to be a contentious few hours as Republicans fight amongst themselves to elect a speaker.\n\nJohnson may not have the full support he needs\n\nJohnson commands one of the slimmest majorities in modern times, 220-215, having lost seats in the November election. That leaves him relying on almost every Republican for support in the face of Democratic opposition.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the Republicans who\u2019ve signaled they may vote against him:\n\nA look at some of the history-making members of Congress set to be sworn in today\n\nThe speaker\u2019s election is set to dominate the opening of the new Congress, but the day will also bring a roster of history-making members.\n\nIn the Senate, two Black women \u2014 Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 will be sworn in, the first time in the nation\u2019s history two Black women senators will serve at the same time.\n\nSen.-elect Andy Kim of New Jersey also is making history as the first Korean American to join the chamber.\n\nIn the House, Sarah McBride is the first openly transgender person in the Congress.\n\nAnd Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who recently suffered a fall overseas and underwent hip replacement surgery, will make her own return to Washington, a reminder of the power she wielded when Democrats last held the majority.\n\nHas a speakership ever been vacant?\n\nThe speakership has been vacant only 13 times in U.S. history, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. No speaker had ever been removed until eight Republicans joined with Democrats to oust McCarthy.\n\nBarring those instances, a speaker is normally elected at the start of a new Congress and serves in the job for the full two-year session.\n\nJohnson\u2019s message to holdouts: \u2018We don\u2019t have time for drama\u2019\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson walked into the Capitol on Friday morning seemingly optimistic about his chances of being reelected speaker by his conference despite growing frustrations amongst far-right members of the party.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter what his message was to his holdouts, the Louisiana Republican said, \u201cWe need to unify,\u201d adding that the speaker election \u201cis not just about one person but about moving forward with the America First agenda, the mandate given forward by the American people.\u201d\n\nJohnson denied that he was making any back-door deals.\n\n\u201cThere is no quid pro quo here. I don\u2019t do anything in exchange for a vote other than commit to make this institution work as effectively and efficiently as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump wishes Johnson good luck\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump called the U.S. House speaker \u201ca fine man of great ability\u201d and wished him good luck on Friday, when the new Congress convenes and Republican lawmakers will decide whether to reelect Mike Johnson to lead their party.\n\nTrump endorsed the Louisiana Republican earlier this week, but whether that support will be enough is unclear. Trump said Johnson \u201cis very close to having 100% support,\u201d but some members of the far right have grown increasingly frustrated with Johnson\u2019s leadership and his handling of funding fights such as the recent short-term spending bill.\n\n\u201cA win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nWhat the speaker battle could mean for Trump\n\nJohnson\u2019s weak grip on the gavel threatens not only his own survival but Trump\u2019s ambitious agenda of tax cuts and mass deportations as Republicans sweep to power in Washington.\n\nA flop by Johnson could throw Monday\u2019s congressional certification of Trump\u2019s 2024 election victory into turmoil if there is no speaker.\n\nJohnson commands one of the slimmest majorities in modern times, having lost seats in the November election, leaving him relying on almost every Republican for support and with nearly no votes to spare.\n\nElecting a speaker\n\nElecting a speaker is the first order of business for the U.S. House after a new session of Congress begins at noon. It\u2019s a vote that members take even before being sworn into office.\n\nThe House cannot organize until it has a speaker because that person effectively serves as the House\u2019s presiding officer and the institution\u2019s administrative head. The House can elect a new speaker at any time if the person occupying that role dies, resigns or is removed from office.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

            "content": "Medtech dealmaking picked up in 2024 after a post-pandemic slump, with deals ranging from multibillion-dollar takeovers to smaller tuck-in acquisitions and the shedding of business groups.\n\nIn a recent investor note, BTIG analysts wrote that 38 acquisitions had closed by Dec. 12, compared to 22 across all of 2023. The number of takeovers was still below the 48 completed in 2021, but 2024 was the second busiest year for deals since 2011, according to the analysts.\n\nMultibillion-dollar buyouts returned last year, led by Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $13.1 billion acquisition of Shockwave Medical, and companies continued to expand their portfolios. Artificial intelligence was a focus of some smaller deals, such as Stryker\u2019s takeover of Care.ai and GE Healthcare\u2019s acquisition of Intelligent Ultrasound Group\u2019s clinical AI software business.\n\nHere, MedTech Dive looks at the top 10 medical technology acquisitions of 2024:\n\n1. Johnson & Johnson buys Shockwave Medical\n\nAmount: $13.1 billion\n\nDate closed: May 31\n\nBuying Shockwave gave J&J devices for treating coronary and peripheral artery disease. The deal made J&J a leader in another segment of the cardiovascular market, adding growth drivers to a business that the company previously bolstered by buying Abiomed for $16.6 billion in 2022.\n\nJ&J reported $229 million in revenue associated with the acquisition of Shockwave in the third quarter, moving the total generated by the acquired assets above $300 million. Tim Schmid, J&J\u2019s worldwide chairman of medtech, said on the company\u2019s earnings call in October that Shockwave \u201ccontinues to perform to expectations.\u201d\n\n2. BD buys Edwards\u2019 critical care group\n\nAmount: $4.2 billion\n\nDate closed: Sept. 3\n\nEdwards Lifesciences\u2019 decision to offload its critical care group enabled BD to buy the business for $4.2 billion. BD has predicted the acquired assets, which form its new advanced patient monitoring (APM) business, can grow 6% to 7% a year.\n\nThe APM business added $74 million to BD\u2019s medical revenue in the fourth quarter of the company\u2019s 2024 financial year, which ended in September. CEO Tom Polen said on an earnings call in November that \u201cintegration is going as expected, and the commercial teams are fully engaged in maximizing the benefits of APM for our customers.\u201d\n\n3. Patient Square Capital to buy Patterson Companies\n\nAmount: $4.1 billion\n\nDate announced: Dec. 11\n\nPatterson Companies, a distributor of dental and animal health products, accepted an offer from the health investment firm Patient Square Capital after facing challenges in the first half of its 2025 financial year. Sales fell short of Patterson\u2019s expectations in the first quarter, mainly because of the Change Healthcare cybersecurity attack, and the company cut its guidance in the second quarter.\n\n4. Boston Scientific buys Axonics\n\nAmount: $3.7 billion\n\nDate closed: Nov. 15\n\nBoston Scientific closed its protracted takeover of Axonics in November. The companies agreed to the deal in January, but scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission delayed completion.\n\nBuying Axonics adds devices to treat urinary and bowel dysfunction to Boston Scientific\u2019s urology business. Boston Scientific grew urology sales by more than 10% in the third quarter and said Axonics can add to the company\u2019s long-term growth.\n\n5. Thomas H. Lee Partners buys Agiliti\n\nAmount: $2.5 billion\n\nDate closed: May 7\n\nPrivate equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners took medical technology services provider Agiliti private in a deal proposed in February worth approximately $2.5 billion. Agiliti went public in 2021, selling shares for $14, but saw its value fall over its time on the New York Stock Exchange. The company accepted a buyout bid of $10 a share, a 39% premium over the stock\u2019s last closing price before news of the deal broke.\n\n6. Johnson & Johnson buys V-Wave\n\nAmount: $600 million upfront, plus up to $1.1 billion in milestones\n\nDate closed: Oct. 9\n\nJ&J agreed to pay $600 million upfront for V-Wave despite the heart implant company\u2019s pivotal trial missing its primary endpoint. The decision was built on evidence that V-Wave\u2019s interatrial shunt device, implanted through a catheter, improves outcomes in people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Michael Bodner, J&J\u2019s global head of heart recovery, discussed the patient population at a Stifel event in November.\n\n\u201cThese patients are short of breath, and they're constantly going to the hospital, being put on systemic diuretics and trying to be optimized,\u201d Bodner said. \u201cIt's 800,000 patients just in the United States that have HFrEF, are not responding to medication and could benefit from a shunt procedure. That's about the same size as the U.S. [transcatheter aortic valve replacement] market.\u201d\n\n7. Owens & Minor to buy Rotech Healthcare Holdings\n\nAmount: $1.36 billion\n\nDate announced: July 23\n\nOwens & Minor agreed to buy home medical equipment company Rotech Healthcare Holdings to further its efforts to generate $5 billion in patient direct sales by 2028. Rotech made $750 million in net revenue in 2023 through sales of products for respiratory diseases, sleep apnea and other conditions.\n\nA request from the FTC delayed the anticipated closing date from the second half of 2024 to the first half of 2025. Owens & Minor CEO Edward Pesicka said on an earnings call in November that \u201cit is common for the [FTC] to request additional information and documentary materials for their review process\u201d and voiced confidence that the deal will close in the months ahead.\n\n8. Boston Scientific buys Silk Road Medical\n\nAmount: $1.26 billion\n\nDate closed: Sept. 17\n\nBoston Scientific added devices to treat carotid artery disease to its vascular product portfolio by acquiring Silk Road Medical. Upon announcing the deal in June, Boston Scientific predicted Silk Road Medical would grow net revenue year over year by a range of from 10% to 12% in 2024, for up to $198 million. J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note to clients that the deal could \u201cmove the needle on growth in the peripheral interventions business.\u201d\n\n9. Edwards Lifesciences to buy Jenavalve Technology and Endotronix\n\nAmount: $1.2 billion\n\nDate announced: July 24\n\nEdwards Lifesciences simultaneously disclosed deals to buy JenaValve Technology and Endotronix for an aggregate upfront purchase price of $1.2 billion.\n\nEndotronix, the developer of an implantable sensor for the management of heart failure patients, commanded a slightly higher upfront fee: $600 million versus $500 million for JenaValve. However, the JenaValve agreement features up to $445 million in milestone payments, compared with $75 million outlined in the Endotronix deal. JenaValve developed a catheter-based treatment for aortic regurgitation.\n\n10. Quest Diagnostics buys Lifelabs\n\nAmount: 1.35 billion Canadian dollars (about $985 million)\n\nDate closed: Aug. 26\n\nQuest Diagnostics bought the laboratory testing business Lifelabs to expand in Canada. Lifelabs is the main rival to the Labcorp-owned Dynacare in Canada. Quest CEO James Davis said on an earnings call in October that population growth and age demographics make Canada \u201ca great place to operate.\u201d",

Even senior Republicans say it\u2019s unclear what would happen if there is no speaker on January 6 \u2014 when Congress is scheduled to certify Trump\u2019s win \u2014 and they\u2019re not eager not to find out.\n\n\u201cTo oppose Johnson now weakens the GOP and strengthens Hakeem Jeffries. It also puts at risk the Electoral College Certification scheduled for 6 Jan. These guys serve as a \u2018fifth column\u2019 for the Dems,\u201d Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska told CNN.\n\nThe House can\u2019t conduct any official business without a speaker, which means there are no clear options to certify Trump\u2019s win without one, according to multiple sources. The message so far from Congress\u2019s own parliamentarians to party leaders has been: Elect a speaker before January 6, according to one of those sources.\n\nRepublicans are also acutely aware that they will have a narrow window to push through their agenda once they take control of both chambers of Congress and the White House. Trump\u2019s inauguration is set to take place on January 20, but the election results need to be certified by Congress before he can take office.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota told CNN that Republicans need to get to work quickly to begin to advance Trump\u2019s agenda with the GOP trifecta in Washington.\n\n\u201cIf we spend even a moment fighting over who should be the speaker, we will have squandered that time. There is an acute understanding of that fact,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe problem is, we have some more colorful members who maybe view things differently.\u201d\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson in Washington on Friday, Dec. 20, 2024. Angelina Katsanis/Politico/AP\n\nTrump chose to publicly endorse Johnson this week because he believes he has a mandate to run Washington once he is sworn in, and he wants a speaker who will not only be loyal to him, but will also carry out his agenda, two Trump advisers told CNN.\n\nWhile Trump and Johnson have had their disagreements in the past, most notably when Trump moved at the eleventh-hour to sink a spending deal Johnson had negotiated with the Senate, advisers tell CNN Trump believes Johnson will help implement his policies in Congress.\n\n\u201c(Johnson) has showed Trump over the last year that he will back him up from the House,\u201d one of the advisers told CNN.\n\nWith those high stakes, Johnson and his whip operation have been racing in recent days to lock up support for the Friday vote. The main task for the team, according to one person involved, is to make sure there aren\u2019t any surprises among the GOP conference, as members have been scattered across the country for the holiday recess.\n\nJohnson faces a difficult path: A historically narrow majority leaves him little room for error. If every House lawmaker shows up and votes, he cannot afford to lose more than one member of his conference to win the gavel. And one Republican lawmaker has already said he won\u2019t support Johnson.\n\nJohnson told Fox News on Thursday that he has been in talks with \u201cevery single one\u201d of his House Freedom Caucus detractors and promised those with concerns \u201cprocess reforms,\u201d acknowledging it is a \u201cnumbers game\u201d and a historically slim margin.\n\n\u201cI think the reason they\u2019re all going to vote yes is this: We\u2019re shifting into a brand-new paradigm,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have unified government that begins tomorrow. We have the White House, the Senate and the House, a totally different situation than we dealt with over the last 14 months since I\u2019ve been speaker. So we\u2019re excited to deliver on the America first agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford any palace drama here. We have got to get the Congress started,\u201d he added.\n\nMany feel confident Johnson will eventually land the votes, especially after Trump\u2019s endorsement and given that no other Republicans are jockeying to run against Johnson.\n\nTrump told reporters on Tuesday night that he would make calls on Johnson\u2019s behalf to fellow Republicans, if necessary, but said he believed Johnson would \u201cget a successful vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one that can win right now. People like him. Almost everybody likes him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOthers are very good too, but they have 30 to 40 people that don\u2019t like \u2018em, so that\u2019s pretty tough.\u201d\n\n\u201cMike Johnson was in a good spot before President Trump\u2019s endorsement. Clearly, he\u2019s in an even better spot now,\u201d Rep. Dusty Johnson told CNN.\n\nTrump had initially planned to endorse Mike Johnson for speaker on New Year\u2019s Day, however, Johnson suggested he should do it sooner, he told a local Baton Rouge radio station. Trump ultimately endorsed him on Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be with him (Trump) at Mar-a-Lago on New Year\u2019s Day. We\u2019re going to map out some strategy, and he wanted to take photos and do a big endorsement on that day. I called him yesterday and said, \u2018Mr. President, let\u2019s go ahead and do that,\u2019 so he did,\u201d Johnson told News Radio 710 KEEL with a chuckle on Tuesday.\n\nThe question now, according to many Republicans, is how much drama Johnson will need to endure before he gets the gavel.\n\nAt least 14 Republicans have said they are undecided and one GOP member, Rep. Thomas Massie, has said he is firmly against Johnson, according to CNN\u2019s most recent count. And at least five have said they are unmoved by Trump\u2019s endorsement of Johnson this week, including Reps. Andy Biggs, Tim Burchett and Chip Roy. Other members including Reps. Victoria Spartz and Andy Harris have asked for commitments from the speaker in exchange for their support.\n\n\u201cI remain undecided, as do a number of my colleagues, because we saw so many of the failures last year that we are concerned about that might limit or inhibit our ability to advance the President\u2019s agenda,\u201d Roy, a Freedom Caucus member who frequently clashes with leadership, said on Fox Business on Tuesday.\n\nEven so, many GOP lawmakers and senior aides feel that Johnson has done the best he could in a difficult situation and say there is not widespread sentiment to push him out. That\u2019s particularly true given it\u2019s unclear who, if anyone, could win the job if Johnson bowed out.\n\n\u201cTo beat a horse, you need a horse,\u201d one GOP source said. \u201cOnce the president came out, it took the wind out of any opposition sail.\u201d\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., at the Capitol in Washington, June 12, 2023. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nPresidential vote certification looms over speaker race\n\nWhile the speaker has no formal role in certifying the presidential results, the House needs to be called into session to count the electoral votes and finalize the win. Traditionally, without a speaker, the House can do nothing besides vote to elect a speaker, vote to recess and vote to adjourn. Lawmakers can\u2019t even be sworn in or set the rules of the House.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re literally just stuck in a cyclical pattern of speaker votes with the clerk overseeing,\u201d one GOP source said, describing what would happen without a speaker at the start of a new Congress.\n\nAnd unlike during the House\u2019s last speaker-less debacle in 2023, there will be no temporary leader poised to take over. When former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted, Rep. Patrick McHenry took over as speaker pro tempore \u2013 serving as a temporary speaker \u2013 because he was McCarthy\u2019s pick when he first took the gavel. But in the 119th Congress, a speaker would first need to be elected before he or she can appoint a pro tempore.\n\nSome experts argue that it\u2019s possible the House could elect a temporary speaker to guide the chamber through the certification process before deciding on a permanent leader.\n\nSome Republicans are privately discussing ways to push the procedural limits so that Congress could certify Trump\u2019s win without a leader. One person described an \u201cemergency break glass option\u201d that would involve allowing the House to vote to go into a special session. But that would be a tough sell for many institutionalist Republicans.\n\nAnother option that is being privately floated around Washington: Pushing the date of Trump\u2019s election certification.\n\n\u201cThere is no constitutional mandate that it\u2019s got to be on Jan. 6,\u201d another GOP source said, as long as it happens before January 20, the date of inauguration.\n\nEven former Rep. Matt Gaetz \u2014 who has previously clashed with Johnson and his leadership team \u2014 suggested his colleagues should back the current speaker rather than risking Trump\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cWe could never have held up McCarthy two years ago for concessions if a Trump certification hung in the balance. Now, it does,\u201d Gaetz said on X, calling resistance to Johnson \u201cfutile.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Haley Talbot contributed to this report.",

            "content": "Then Speaker-elect Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., puts the gavel down before speaking at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2023.\n\nRepublicans promised big changes in the first 100 days of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. As new members get sworn in on Friday, the 119th Congress\u2019 first day also includes a politically fraught task: the House of Representatives must elect a leader.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson is in hot water. Most recently, he received criticism from some members of the Republican Conference for compromises he made with Democrats in a short-term spending bill last month. That bill was rejected in favor of a clean spending bill that kept the government running over the Christmas break.\n\nJohnson reportedly made phone calls to his colleagues in the House on Thursday ahead of the election for the gavel on Friday. So far, no other candidates from the House of Representatives are in the running. Speaking to Fox News Business from the Capitol, Johnson said he spoke to those holding out on him and is willing to consider their asks for \u201cprocess\u201d reforms.\n\n\u201cI think this is going to turn out well tomorrow, and we\u2019ll stay unified and we\u2019ll get all this done,\u201d he said. From the looks of it, Utah\u2019s representatives are largely in favor of continuing with Johnson as speaker.\n\nUtah Representatives show support for Speaker Johnson\n\nRep. Blake Moore, R-Utah, the vice chair of the House Republican Conference, said he firmly stands behind Johnson and made a case for others to follow suit in a statement to the Deseret News.\n\n\u201cTo try and force him out, or more explicitly, force someone else in, would be nothing short of dishonest,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing Speaker of the House against an opposing senate majority leader and White House is the most difficult job in American politics, and Johnson has done a superb job handling every angle.\u201d\n\nMoore added, \u201cTo not give him the opportunity to work with a favorable senate majority leader and White House would be appalling and entirely dishonest. Instead of garnering attention by opposing the Speaker, Republicans would get far more accomplished by supporting him.\u201d\n\nUtah\u2019s Rep. Burgess Owens also displayed optimism. As a former NFL player and Super Bowl champion, Owens emphasized the importance of teamwork for accomplishing Republican priorities.\n\n\u201cAs a team, we have to recognize the way we\u2019ve done things in the past to get things through has not worked,\u201d Rep. Burgess Owens told NOTUS in December. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on following our leader and work as a team. If we do that, it\u2019s amazing the miracles that can happen.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsed Johnson. Will it help?\n\nTrump gave Johnson his endorsement, as the Deseret News previously reported. Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, sided with Trump, saying Johnson should continue to hold the gavel. \u201cWith his leadership skills, Republicans will be able to deliver on President Trump\u2019s agenda starting day one,\u201d she said in a post on X.\n\nUtah Rep.-elect Dr. Mike Kennedy\u2019s team told the Deseret News he also plans to support Johnson. Sen.-elect John Curtis will not be voting since he is an outgoing member of the House of Representatives. According to the manual of the House of Representatives, the Speaker is elected by the representatives-elect.\n\nThe big question still remains: Will Trump\u2019s backing be enough to persuade lawmakers who have soured on the speaker?\n\nTrump and Johnson shared tense moments leading up to the passage of the spending bill last month, when Trump reportedly doubted the speaker\u2019s abilities. But this relationship may be on the mend; Johnson was spotted at Trump\u2019s club, Mar-a-Lago, on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nTrump, while entering the New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations at his residence Tuesday night, said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get a successful vote.\u201d\n\nHe added he would be willing to personally call lawmakers to shore up support for Johnson, and according to reports, Trump has already reached out to Texas Rep. Chip Roy.\n\nCan Speaker Johnson hold on to his gavel?\n\nThe vote for the speakership is set for Friday. The House is expected to have a 220-215 Republican majority on Friday, although it\u2019s expected to shortly shrink down to 217-215 since a few lawmakers will join Trump\u2019s cabinet.\n\nRelated House GOP grapples with historically small majority\n\nJohnson can\u2019t afford to lose more than one vote. So far, his critics include Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who argued that while he respected Trump\u2019s endorsement, Johnson wouldn\u2019t further Republican priorities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen Johnson partner with the Democrats to send money to Ukraine, authorize spying on Americans, and blow the budget,\u201d he said in a post on X. In another lengthier post, he claimed Johnson lacked \u201csituational awareness ... to know what can pass and what cannot,\u201d and said he is not \u201ccompetent\u201d enough to capitalize on the Republican trifecta, where the House, Senate and White House are under GOP control for the foreseeable future.\n\nHe argued Johnson \u201cwas only electable the first time because he hadn\u2019t held any type of leadership position, nor had he ever fought for anything, so no one disliked him and everyone was tired of voting,\u201d following former Speaker Kevin McCarthy\u2019s ousting.\n\nOthers like Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., are looking to get assurances from Trump.\n\nJohnson could face a tough battle in 2025\n\nEven if Johnson manages to hold onto his gavel, the next year could prove to be hard for him. As Fox News\u2019 Chad Pergram wrote in a post, the House rules package for the 119th Congress has a provision that would allow nine representatives from the ruling party to introduce a resolution to vacate the House speaker\u2019s chair and hold a new election.\n\nFormer Michigan Rep. Justin Amash in a post criticizing the rule said it rule protects Johnson from the Democratic Party\u2019s pushback. Amash, a Republican, argued the speaker represents the House, not the \u201cmajority party.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny one member (of any party or no party) should be able to challenge the speaker\u2019s authority. The other members are free to vote down the challenge. That\u2019s how it has worked since the earliest days of Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cA speaker who needs to be shielded from normal legislative accountability doesn\u2019t deserve to be speaker.\u201d",

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nThis world's biggest maker of health care products has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 6.53%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Johnson & Johnson was expected to post earnings of $2.22 per share, but it reported $2.42 per share instead, representing a surprise of 9.01%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.71 per share, while it actually produced $2.82 per share, a surprise of 4.06%.\n\nFor Johnson & Johnson, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nJohnson & Johnson currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.75%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on January 22, 2025.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.",

It\u2019s a scientific experiment he conducts on a daily basis \u2014 with himself as the test subject.\n\nFrom director Chris Smith (Tiger King, Fyre), Don\u2019t Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever goes behind the headlines surrounding Johnson\u2019s antiaging crusade. It dives deep into his psyche, revealing the drastic shifts that took the entrepreneur from his own personal struggles to dedicating his time and energy \u2014 and a considerable amount of his fortune \u2014 to living long beyond even the most ambitious human life expectancy.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that you may already be familiar with Johnson, as he\u2019s been the subject of a number of articles in recent years that have gone viral. \u201cThe things I do lend themselves to great headlines and people forming certain conclusions,\u201d Johnson tells Tudum. \u201cI think what this film will do is maybe [provide] some more nuance on why we\u2019re doing this. I think it will make the endeavor much more relatable to their lives than they imagine.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it was those very headlines that led the documentary\u2019s director to connect with Johnson.\n\n\u201cLast year, I saw a headline about a man spending $2 million a year to become 18 again,\u201d Smith tells Tudum. \u201cThat initial curiosity led to a 12-month journey following Bryan Johnson\u2019s quest and its effect on those closest to him, while interviewing experts from around the world to get a better understanding of the people trying to live healthier, longer. A year later, I drink less, go to bed earlier, and wear a ring that tells me how bad my sleep is.\u201d\n\nSmith wasn\u2019t the only filmmaker interested in chronicling Johnson\u2019s daily life. \u201cI was very late in reaching out to Bryan\u201d he recalls. \u201cBy the time I got on a Zoom call with them, they told me that they had already been in touch with 65 other production companies.\u201d\n\nAs with any story that goes viral, however, Johnson has attracted his fair share of online vitriol, too. \u201cThe hate really surprised me, and then it just persisted and intensified. But it\u2019s really turned a corner,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d say [our project] has tremendous support. People are now adamant defenders of the objective.\u201d\n\nThe documentary goes beyond the headlines to delve into Johnson\u2019s personal history and motivations, but Smith clarifies that the goal is not to prove Johnson\u2019s detractors wrong. \u201cThe goal is never to try to change minds,\u201d he says of his approach to creating documentaries. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to put information out there in a way that people can make their own decisions and try to reflect things as accurately as we can.\u201d\n\nIn addition to showing Johnson\u2019s home life, the doc follows him as he travels out of state and abroad for procedures meant to improve his health and extend his lifespan. \u201cThe longevity field is evolving very rapidly, and Bryan is on the cutting edge of that,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThings were changing all the time in terms of his pursuit.\u201d With intimate access to Johnson\u2019s grueling daily routine, home life, medical procedures, and friends and family, Don\u2019t Die tackles one man\u2019s obsession alongside the larger issues it raises about our fear of mortality and long-held notions about growing older.\n\n\u201cWe all want to see tomorrow happen, and we all want to live and be our best selves,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is about, the immediate here and now, not some esoteric idea about some technological leap forward. It\u2019s really about being our best self right now and how we take that idea and then bridge it into the future.\u201d Make a New Year\u2019s resolution to check out the documentary and explore a new perspective on what it means to be in good health.\n\nDon\u2019t Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever is produced by Smith for Library Films, as well as Ashlee Vance and Daniel Koehler. It premieres on Netflix on Jan. 1.",

            "content": "Happy New Year and welcome to 2025. We\u2019re only publishing AM editions this week. But given the busy news cycle, we\u2019ll send out texts and special editions as needed.\n\nThere are 19 days until Donald Trump is sworn in for his second term as president. And it\u2019s just two days until the 119th Congress kicks off. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll begin.\n\nThe main event: Choosing a speaker. The House will vote Friday to elect a speaker for the 119th Congress. Trump has endorsed Speaker Mike Johnson for another term. Trump told reporters Tuesday night at Mar-a-Lago that he isn\u2019t calling anyone on Johnson\u2019s behalf, but he will if necessary.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one that can win right now,\u201d Trump said of Johnson. \u201cPeople like him. Almost everybody likes him. Others are very good too but they have 30 or 40 people that don\u2019t like [them.] So that\u2019s pretty tough. \u2026 He\u2019s a good man. He\u2019s a wonderful person. And that\u2019s what you need.\u201d\n\nYet Johnson is in a tight spot \u2014 to say the least. There are roughly a dozen House Republicans who have expressed skepticism about electing the speaker to another term. And with the paper-thin GOP majority, that\u2019s problematic.\n\nSo there are several questions to focus on. The first is obvious: Can Johnson win? The second: Will it take Johnson multiple ballots to secure the speakership? Third: Does Johnson weaken himself so much in his quest to keep the speaker\u2019s gavel that he can\u2019t govern? And lastly but most importantly: Does Trump pull back if he sees Johnson\u2019s weakness?\n\nIn addition to his Trump endorsement, Johnson\u2019s greatest attribute is that there\u2019s still no obvious alternative to the Louisiana Republican. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer and Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) all want the job, but like in October 2023, they all face huge obstacles.\n\nJordan\u2019s allies will never let Scalise be speaker, and vice versa. Emmer has made strides in his relationship with Trump, but he\u2019s still seen as a bit of a turncoat in Trump world after voting to certify Joe Biden\u2019s victory in 2021.\n\nOther potential candidates \u2014 say House Appropriations Committee Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) \u2014 don\u2019t want the job.\n\nThe basics. House Republicans hold a razor-slim majority with just 219 seats. They\u2019d have 220 if former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) shows up on Jan. 3. Gaetz resigned from the 118th Congress but he could \u2014 theoretically \u2014 get sworn into the 119th.\n\nThis all means that Johnson may only be able to lose between one and three votes, depending on whether members vote for another candidate by name and who votes \u201cpresent.\u201d Whether all 215 Democrats will be there is another question (Members don\u2019t get paid if they don\u2019t get sworn in, which happens after the speaker vote.) We won\u2019t know more until members start voting on the floor.\n\nHouse Republicans don\u2019t currently plan to have a GOP conference meeting Friday morning ahead of the vote.\n\nThe no\u2019s. Inside the House Republican leadership, just one GOP lawmaker is seen as completely unmovable and will oppose Johnson come hell or high water: Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.). Massie has chafed at Johnson\u2019s leadership for months. Massie has been on a bit of an X rampage about Johnson of late. He laid out a quite detailed case against Johnson on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nThen there are those like Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas). Roy has been calling colleagues to discuss how to proceed. A Jordan ally, Roy has cast doubt on Johnson\u2019s ability to advance Trump\u2019s agenda. But even those closest to Jordan say that they don\u2019t think it\u2019s feasible for the Ohio Republican to become speaker.\n\nThere are 11 Republicans who voted to oust Johnson back in May after he brought a massive Ukraine aid package to the floor: Reps. Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Eric Burlison (Mo.), Eli Crane (Ariz.), Warren Davidson (Ohio), Paul Gosar (Ariz.), Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), Barry Moore (Ala.), Victoria Spartz (Ind.), Roy and Massie.\n\nBiggs told Fox News he\u2019s not committed to Johnson publicly or privately. Burlison has been sharply critical of Johnson since the recent government-funding vote. Spartz sent Johnson a list of demands \u2014 many of them unachievable \u2014 in exchange for her vote.\n\nWhat Johnson has going for him. Johnson has been working the conference by phone over the Christmas break. He held a call with the Five Families \u2014 the different ideological factions in the House GOP \u2014 and individual lawmakers.\n\nSome members of the House Freedom Caucus are actively trying to search for an alternative to Johnson, quizzing each other about what candidate could win. But they don\u2019t have a viable alternative that can get to 218.\n\nOthers in the hardline caucus have been wondering what concessions they could get from Johnson. But sources close to Johnson say he isn\u2019t interested in \u201cbackroom deals,\u201d including altering the rules package for the 119th Congress.\n\nRemember \u2014 if there\u2019s no speaker by Jan. 6, the House can\u2019t certify Trump\u2019s Electoral College victory. So it\u2019s in Trump\u2019s interest to get a speaker quickly and Johnson is the incumbent.",

To hear the clang of the bell, inch toward the middle of the ring and hurl his right fist at the other man?\n\nWill it be Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores, or will it be Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson?\n\nThey are both willing, and everyone knows it. One shoulders a bag of tricks, the other a sack of deception. Facing them is headache-inducing for many of the same reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs much as the initial strike matters, neither will cower. Earlier this season, Flores connected first, and Johnson responded with some left-handed jabs of his own. The fight ignited a flurry. The pace picked up. A hypothetical punch to the body here. An uppercut to the chin there. They swung wildly. Each dodged more than his fair share. In the end, Johnson\u2019s fist was the one being tugged into the air.\n\nGO DEEPER Goff outduels Vikings, Darnold as Lions win 31-29: Takeaways\n\nBut now they meet again. These familiar foes, play-calling savages who have created two of the more confounding units in recent memory, meet on the grandest regular-season stage for the fourth time. It will be, in the words of Vikings special teams coordinator Matt Daniels, \u201ca slobberknocker.\u201d\n\n\u201cBen is one of the best in the game as far as calling it,\u201d Flores said Tuesday. \u201cBig, big challenge for us.\u201d\n\nHistory verifies that, considering the Lions have won all three matchups against the Vikings since Flores became their defensive coordinator in 2023. Detroit is averaging a smidge over 30 points in those three victories, and its offense is averaging 386 yards. Maybe most importantly, the Lions have turned the ball over only twice in those three contests; Jahmyr Gibbs fumbled in Week 16 of the 2023 season, and David Montgomery fumbled in Week 7 this year.\n\nFlores\u2019 strategy has differed in the three games for several reasons. In 2023, the Vikings did not meet the Lions until late in the season. At that point, the defense had already been leaking oil, susceptible to middle-of-the-field passes and incapable of generating a pass rush to limit quarterbacks from finding those zones. Not to mention, two of the cornerbacks playing in some of those games \u2014 Akayleb Evans and Andrew Booth Jr. \u2014 are no longer with the team.\n\nEven this season, the Vikings faced off against the Lions at a suboptimal time. Linebacker Blake Cashman, one of Minnesota\u2019s primary defensive communicators and whose vision in underneath zones exponentially helps the Vikings\u2019 coverage plans, missed the game because of a turf toe injury suffered a couple of weeks earlier in London. The Vikings replaced him with Ivan Pace Jr., who thrives more as a blitzer and run defender, and Josh Metellus, who plays admirably in the box but cannot fully make up for Cashman\u2019s physicality.\n\nThe Week 7 game, in particular, is revealing upon review. Look at the Vikings\u2019 defensive metrics by quarter in that game:\n\n1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q EPA/play 0.58 -1.00 -0.62 0.52 Success rate 78.6% 38.90% 45.5% 72.2% Yards per play 3.5 11.9 9.4 3.4 Points per drive 0.00 10.5 7.00 0.75\n\nA few days after the Lions\u2019 31-29 win, one Vikings defender invoked the stock market to explain the back-and-forth. Essentially, this player said, the Vikings invested in a plan centered on their core beliefs: Stop the run and force opponents into third-and-long situations. The plan worked initially, then became a question of: Detroit is going to adapt, so how long do we continue to stick with a plan that\u2019s working?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Vikings had to decide whether to ride an ascending stock or sell it off at peak value. Knowing the right time to make that decision is key only if you can adapt on the fly. The Lions punished the Vikings in the second and third quarters with stretch runs, swing passes, quick checkdowns into areas where the Vikings had blitzed, deep in-breaking routes and some exceptional designs based on the Vikings\u2019 tendencies.\n\nOnce, quarterback Jared Goff handed the ball to Gibbs on a third-and-7 situation in the red zone, a situation the Vikings typically play with light personnel on their front. Coordinators have rarely had the gall to try to run it in those spots, but the Lions did and scored. Another time, the Lions motioned receiver Tim Patrick into a seven-man protection situation, allowing Goff enough time to find Amon-Ra St. Brown for a 35-yard touchdown.\n\nThe Vikings\u2019 defensive staff privately complimented Goff\u2019s 22-of-25, 280-yard and two-touchdown performance afterward. Tuesday, Flores praised Goff and specifically identified Goff\u2019s current confidence level.\n\n\u201cHe knows where he wants to go with the ball,\u201d Flores said. \u201cHe knows where his receivers are supposed to be. He knows what the protection is supposed to be. He knows what he\u2019s looking at defensively.\u201d\n\nGO DEEPER NFL Week 17 best and worst coaching decisions: Kevin O'Connell has Sam Darnold dealing\n\nJohnson\u2019s job before (and on) Sunday night is to keep Goff in this exact headspace, and Flores\u2019 job is to create doubt. Neither will matter if the Vikings cannot limit Gibbs, whose 45-yard run in the second quarter of the Week 7 game is still the longest Minnesota has given up all season. Keep him in check and it\u2019ll take some of the sting out of the play-action pass, which the Lions use more than any other team in the NFL (37.9 percent of snaps).\n\nThen, the Vikings will have to decide: What is the correct blend between pass rush and coverage? Is it a four-man rush with seven defenders in coverage? A five-man rush with six defenders in coverage? A six-man rush, apply maximum pressure approach? The Vikings have tried almost all of it in the past against the Lions, though it has been a while since Flores turned the notch to 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat would be a curveball, the hurled right fist to kick off the fireworks. Or maybe the Lions will beat the Vikings to the punch by using more 13 personnel than they have in past matchups (around 3 percent) to hammer Minnesota on the ground. That\u2019s the beauty of a clash like this one. Any forecast requires a caveat. Every prediction contains a counter.\n\nAll bets are off once the bell clangs and the fighters inch toward each other in the ring. Any step, any punch, any round has a chance to sway the result, and there\u2019s nothing more you can ask for than that.\n\n(Photo of Brian Flores: Stephen Maturen / Getty Images)",

Nathan Howard/Reuters\n\nDuring the last Congress, a single lawmaker was able to force a vote to \u201cvacate the chair\u201d -- which former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz used to remove then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy and plunged the House into chaos for several weeks before Johnson was elected speaker. Historically, this had been the position of the House, but hard-right Republicans used the tool as a threat to remove then-Speaker John Boehner in 2015. Democrats ultimately changed the rules to require the majority of the House to support the motion when they controlled the House but McCarthy was forced to switch the rule back by hardliners when the GOP got the majority back.\n\nAfter a speaker is elected, the House will hold a vote on the rules package -- requiring a simple majority for passage. Democrats are not expected to help Republicans clear this package, so Johnson won\u2019t be able to afford many GOP defections. This is typically the House\u2019s second vote they\u2019ll take after the election of the speaker and swearing-in of members.\n\nJohnson's reelection as speaker is not a sure thing. The speaker vote comes after a number of House Republicans grew frustrated with Johnson during the final days of the 118th Congress, which saw a bitter fight over spending that nearly caused a government shutdown before Christmas.\n\nAnd while the nine-member threshold makes it harder to oust a speaker, it does not completely remove the threat.\n\nFreedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris of Maryland and Main Street Caucus Chairman Dusty Johnson of South Dakota -- who negotiated the deal appeared with Johnson at a press conference where they explained the change in November.\n\n\"We had an opportunity to set the motion to vacate at a higher than number one, that motion to vacate will be set at nine in return for getting rid of some amendments that probably would have divided this conference,\" Dusty Johnson said.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson speaks as he stands with Rep. Dusty Johnson and Rep. Andy Harris during a press conference for House Republicans, following their leadership meeting, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Nov. 13, 2024.

That's it,\" Harris said.\n\nEarlier this year, Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to vacate the speaker's chair, threatening to oust Johnson just months after he ascended to the speakership. When she officially triggered a vote on her motion to oust Johnson, Democrats joined almost all Republicans to overwhelmingly reject her move.",

From sharing glimpses of their beautiful bond to spending some quality time together, the couple has been enjoying the holidays to the fullest. But the standout moment among all their activities remains Hilton\u2019s recent victory.\n\nThe Texas Bowl was all about LSU\u2019s dominance, and Hilton made sure his name was etched into the narrative. The junior wide receiver showcased his talent with a stunning 44-yard touchdown and a team-high 113 receiving yards on just four catches.

Johnson, an LSU basketball star and a rising rap artist signed to Roc Nation, initially kept their romance low-key, sharing cryptic posts with Hilton\u2019s jersey or cropped-out images.\n\nInside LSU\u2019s power couple\u2019s epic year through the lens of Flau\u2019Jae Johnson\n\nIt was during the holidays that the couple made things official.

            "content": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) closed the latest trading day at $144.62, indicating a +0.89% change from the previous session's end. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.43%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.07%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.9%.\n\nShares of the world's biggest maker of health care products have depreciated by 7.4% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Medical sector's loss of 7.03% and the S&P 500's loss of 1.98%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Johnson & Johnson in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on January 22, 2025. On that day, Johnson & Johnson is projected to report earnings of $2 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 12.66%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $22.54 billion, indicating a 5.37% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $9.94 per share and a revenue of $88.84 billion, representing changes of +0.2% and -4.49%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Johnson & Johnson. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.04% higher. Johnson & Johnson is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.\n\nLooking at its valuation, Johnson & Johnson is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 14.42. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 13.8.\n\nMeanwhile, JNJ's PEG ratio is currently 2.47. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Large Cap Pharmaceuticals was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.45 at yesterday's closing price.",

            "content": "For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But if you try your hand at stock picking, you risk returning less than the market. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shareholders, since the share price is down 16% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 21%. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 12% in the last 90 days.\n\nSo let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nView our latest analysis for Johnson & Johnson\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring the three years that the share price fell, Johnson & Johnson's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 3.3% each year. The share price decline of 6% is actually steeper than the EPS slippage. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, in the past.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNYSE:JNJ Earnings Per Share Growth December 31st 2024\n\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Johnson & Johnson, it has a TSR of -8.8% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nJohnson & Johnson shareholders are down 5.7% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 24%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 3%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Johnson & Johnson better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Johnson & Johnson has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.",

Scores of pharmas and biotechs downsized and restructured their workforces to stay afloat, including large companies such as Bayer, Bristol Myers Squibb and Johnson & Johnson. Some of those businesses cut thousands of employees.\n\nBioSpace tracked the layoffs below. Keep reading for details on these cuts.\n\nDecember Layoffs: Javara, Ring, Outlook and More\n\nJavara\n\nDec. 23\n\nJavara, a North Carolina\u2013based clinical research organization, is laying off staff as the company restructures, according to Fierce Biotech. Details about the number of employees being let go was not reported.\n\n\u201cAs we look towards the future of Javara, we are focused on becoming even more agile and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of our patients, sites, healthcare partners and sponsor clients,\u201d a Javara spokesperson wrote in an email to the publication. \u201cTo reach these goals, we made the decision to reduce operational complexities and simplify select workflows.\u201d\n\nRing Therapeutics\n\nDec. 18\n\nRing Therapeutics has parted ways with \u201cjust under 50%\u201d of its employees, a spokesperson told Endpoints News on Wednesday. Ring, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass.\u2013based Flagship startup focused on gene therapy, now has about 40 staff members left.\n\n\u201cWe recently made the decision to focus on Anellobricks, Ring\u2019s proprietary genetic medicine vector platform, which affords exceptional scalability and has the potential to transform genetic medicine,\u201d the spokesperson wrote to Endpoints. \u201cAs a result, we have reduced our current staff to ensure we have the right mix of skills and capabilities to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses and we advance toward the clinic.\u201d\n\nOutlook Therapeutics\n\nDec. 17\n\nJust weeks after announcing disappointing clinical trial results for its ophthalmic drug, Outlook Therapeutics announced it\u2019s cut 23% of its workforce to help reduce costs, extend its cash runway and secure FDA approval of bevacizumab. The Iselin, New Jersey\u2013based biopharma expects the move will save $1.4 million annually, excluding workforce reduction expenses.\n\nFive employees were let go, according to a Dec. 16 SEC filing. The cuts likely leave Outlook with 16 employees.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the company announced its NORSE EIGHT clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients had failed to meet the FDA\u2019s prespecified non-inferiority endpoint at week eight. However, Outlook noted that preliminary data showed an improvement in vision, the presence of biologic activity and a continued favorable safety profile.\n\nThe company expects to announce additional trial data in January and plans to resubmit a biologics license application in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile the FDA in 2023 nixed approval for bevacizumab to treat wet AMD, the drug has European Commission marketing authorization. Outlook plans to launch bevacizumab in the European Union and the U.K. in the first half of 2025.\n\nEditas\n\nDec. 16\n\nUnable to find a development sponsor for its sickle cell disease therapy renizgamglogene autogedtemcel, Editas announced Dec. 12 it will terminate work on the ex vivo therapy and cut about 65% of its employees over the next six months. The move will affect several members of the company\u2019s management team, including Chief Medical Officer Baisong Mei.\n\nThe biotech expects these adjustments will extend its runway into the second quarter of 2027.\n\nMoving forward, Editas will focus its resources and expertise on developing in vivo CRISPR-editing assets. This pivot will capitalize on recent preclinical findings in various tissues.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBavarian Nordic\n\nDec. 12\n\nDenmark-based vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic will close its San Diego research and development (R&D) site and lay off 48 employees there, according to a Dec. 9 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. There\u2019ll be two rounds of layoffs\u2014with the first effective Dec. 13 and the second on or about March 31\u2014and the site will close on or about April 1.\n\nBavarian acquired the San Diego facility from Emergent BioSolutions in 2023 as part of a deal that gave the vaccine maker Emergent\u2019s travel health business. In addition to the R&D site, Bavarian received the rights to Vivotif, a typhoid vaccine; Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine; and CHIKV VLP, a chikungunya vaccine candidate that\u2019s now in Phase III clinical development.\n\nThe company also announced this week that it plans to buy back up to 150 million Danish kroner ($21 million) of its shares. Bavarian stated the decision should be viewed in the context of \u201cimproved visibility\u201d around its travel health business, citing events including the near-term completion of the integration of assets from Emergent. That integration, Bavarian stated, includes a \u201cfinal restructuring\u201d of the R&D organization, which it expects will generate annual savings of 50 million to 75 million Danish kroner ($7 million to $10.5 million).\n\nOnce the San Diego site closes, Bavarian\u2019s remaining U.S. presence will be its U.S. subsidiary in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBenevolentAI\n\nDec. 12\n\nBenevolentAI will cut its workforce as part of a strategic overhaul aimed at streamlining operations, reducing costs and returning to its core mission of technology in service of science, the company announced Dec. 11. The London-based business did not share how many people the workforce reduction will affect.\n\nThe layoffs are not BenevolentAI\u2019s first employee cuts. In May 2023, the company announced it would let go about 180 people as part of a reorganization designed to optimize its pipeline and technology platforms to reduce costs and maximize value for stakeholders. In April 2024, BenevolentAI announced it would cut 30% of staff. It also closed its U.S. office.\n\nMoving forward, the company will focus on creating standalone products that meet its partners\u2019 drug development needs, Kenneth Mulvany, executive chairman, founder and activist shareholder, said in the announcement. He noted that BenevolentAI\u2019s new strategic direction \u201cbuilds on our strengths, empowering the biopharma industry with cutting-edge AI technologies backed by our compelling industry and patient proof points.\u201d\n\nBased on anticipated savings from streamlined operational efforts, the company expects to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\nChroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\n\nDec. 12\n\nAs part of Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\u2019 merger, an unspecified number of employees will be laid off due to areas of redundancies and overlap, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nBoston-based Chroma and Cambridge-based Nvelop announced their merger Dec. 11. The combined entity, nChroma Bio, has secured $75 million in new financing. That money, in addition to the cash on hand for both companies at the time of the deal, will provide multiple years of runway, according to the announcement.\n\nThe funds will also aid continued development of nChroma\u2019s epigenetic editing platform and advance lead candidate CRMA-1001 into the clinic and to key data readouts. CRMA-1001 is a liver-targeted epigenetic editing therapy intended to treat chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection.\n\nCellectar Biosciences\n\nDec. 11\n\nCellectar Biosciences on Tuesday kicked off a strategic reprioritization initiative that will involve an \u201cimmediate reduction in headcount\u201d of 60%. The biotech expects to complete the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe move follows the biotech\u2019s communications with FDA regarding its cancer drug candidate iopofosine I 131. The regulator had indicated in early 2024 that Cellectar could seek accelerated approval for iopofosine I 131 using the company\u2019s ongoing CLOVER WaM trial. Now, however, the FDA has said the biotech will need to run an additional randomized and controlled confirmatory study to support a regulatory application.\n\nIn light of this change in requirements, Cellectar has decided to pursue strategic opportunities to support the further development and commercialization of iopofosine I 131. \u201cWe have determined that such a program may best be brought to market by a larger organization with greater resources,\u201d CEO James Caruso said in a statement.\n\nCellectar expects the restructuring effort to extend its cash runway into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nCarisma Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring that includes reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on fibrosis, oncology and autoimmune disease therapies, Carisma Therapeutics will lay off 34% of its employees, the Philadelphia-based biopharma announced Dec. 9. The cuts includes 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff, according to a Dec. 9 SEC filing.\n\nThe company also underwent a workforce reduction earlier this year. In April, Carisma announced it would cut staff by about 37% during the second quarter. According to an April 1 SEC filing, the company had 107 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. This would likely leave Carisma with 44 full-time employees once the latest cuts are complete.\n\nIn addition to its workforce reduction, Carisma\u2019s strategic restructuring includes ending development of CT-0525, a gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-M) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) metastasis.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBelharra Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nBelharra Therapeutics, a San Diego\u2013based startup working on small molecule oncology and immunology drugs, has cut 21 employees, leaving it with 30 people, down from 52 in June, Endpoints News reported on Dec. 9.\n\nThe employee cuts are expected to allow Belharra to extend its runway to achieve \u201ckey inflection points\u201d while alleviating capital raise pressures, according to a spokesperson\u2019s emailed statement to Endpoints. That spokesperson also wrote that the biotech will continue advancing its lead programs and working with partners Genentech and Sanofi.\n\nBelharra announced its partnership with Sanofi in June, stating that the collaboration would leverage Belharra\u2019s non-covalent chemoproteomics platform to identify and advance small molecules against undisclosed Sanofi-designated immunology targets. BioSpace named the move one of the top immunology and inflammation deals of 2024 at that time. Belharra is eligible to receive up to nearly $700 million in aggregate research, development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\n\nBelharra launched in January 2023 with $130 million in total funding that included $80 million upfront from Genentech, with whom it had inked a multiyear partnership. The biotech also received $50 million in Series A financing from Versant Ventures. In January, BioSpace named Belharra to its NextGen Bio Class of 2024 list, which recognized the hottest new life sciences companies in the U.S.\n\nNational Resilience\n\nDec. 9\n\nNational Resilience on Friday announced that it is laying off 105 employees from its site in Alachua, Florida, as part of a strategic refocusing initiative.\n\nThe affected employees will start being let go in February 2025, with terminations to continue through June of next year. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a Resilience spokesperson said that the CDMO is downsizing its Florida presence \u201cto focus more strategically on commercial development and manufacturing to meet customers\u2019 demands and patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nResilience will continue to fulfill its contract obligations with the customers of the Florida site, according to the spokesperson.\n\nResilience came to own the Alachua facility after it bought Ology Bioservices in April 2021. The site primarily produces drugs and biologics for commercial clients as well as the U.S. government. At the time of the acquisition deal, it had won more than $1.8 billion in government contracts.\n\nAlso on Friday, Resilience named William Marth as its new CEO.\n\nAmplifyBio\n\nDec. 9\n\nAmplifyBio is closing up shop in South San Francisco as it lays off an unspecified number of employees in the region and terminates its R&D and characterization services, according to a report from Fierce Biotech on Friday.\n\nSome of the work in the shuttered site will move to the manufacturer\u2019s new facility in Ohio, a company spokesperson told Fierce, adding that these changes will allow AmplifyBio to \u201cintegrate early drug discovery and characterization more seamlessly\u201d with its manufacturing activities. The reorganization will also help the CDMO lower overhead costs and provide its services \u201cat more market-competitive prices,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\n\nAmplifyBio is a preclinical contract research organization and manufacturing service provider that provides discovery, characterization and optimization services, as well as in vitro and in vivo safety studies. Its work includes several treatment modalities, such as small molecule drugs, mRNA therapies and cell and gene treatments.\n\nAgenus\n\nDec. 5\n\nA week after announcing a strategic operational alignment that includes shifting two California manufacturing facilities\u2019 focus to contract biologics manufacturing, Agenus has announced employee cuts are on the way. The Lexington, Massachusetts\u2013based immuno-oncology company did not offer details on the layoffs, such as how many people they\u2019ll affect or which locations they\u2019ll involve.\n\nAccording to a March SEC filing, Agenus had 389 employees as of the beginning of that month. In addition to its Lexington headquarters, the company also has sites in Berkeley, Emeryville and Vacaville, California, and in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn its Dec. 5 announcement, Agenus noted it will concentrate resources on its lead botensilimab/balstilimab (BOT/BAL) program, which has \u201cdemonstrated robust clinical activity\u201d in several types of cancer, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). That regimen made the news earlier this year, when the FDA advised against the company applying for accelerated approval for BOT/BAL to treat relapsed/refractory MSS CRC without active liver metastases.\n\nAs Agenus moves forward with advancing BOT/BAL through clinical development and preparing for global regulatory submissions, it\u2019s also working on significant cost reductions, as noted in its Dec. 5 announcement. The company is targeting a 60% cut in annual expenditures and hopes to lower its fiscal year 2025 cash burn to about $100 million. Agenus also recently secured a $22 million mortgage to boost its cash reserves.\n\nAlligator Bioscience\n\nDec. 3\n\nSwedish biotech Alligator Bioscience on Dec. 2 announced that it will lay off 70% of its employees in a sweeping strategic re-evaluation campaign.\n\nAfter the workforce reduction, the company will be down to 15 full-time staff. The layoffs, which are still subject to negotiation with trade unions, will mainly affect employees working in discovery and other nonclinical posts. Alligator expects the restructuring to lower its operating expenses by around $5.9 million annually.\n\nIn its press release, the biotech cited its \u201ccurrent capital constraints\u201d as the reason for the strategic restructuring. Alligator also noted that all but one of its assets are now \u201cunder strategic evaluation.\u201d The company will focus all of its resources on its lead asset mitazalimab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody being assessed for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nIdorsia Pharmaceuticals\n\nDec. 2\n\nAs part of cost-cutting measures while it looks to sell the global rights to hypertension drug aprocitentan, Idorsia Pharmaceuticals is considering cutting up to 270 positions globally, the company announced last week. The biotech expects those cuts to mainly affect its research and development and support functions at its headquarters near Basel, Switzerland. The company has one U.S. site, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nRegarding the global rights to aprocitentan, sold in the U.S. as Tryvio, Idorsia has entered into exclusive negotiations with an undisclosed company. As part of those discussions, the biotech noted it will receive a $35 million exclusivity fee that will extend its cash runway into 2025.\n\nAccording to Idorsia, the agreement under discussion could include an upfront payment, milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales in return for the transfer of global rights to the drug and some company employees. The biotech hopes to sign the agreement before the end of this year and close the deal in early 2025.\n\nIdorsia spun out of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of Actelion in 2017. In March, the company received FDA approval for Tryvio, an asset J&J gave back to the biotech in September 2023.\n\nNovember Layoffs: Kronos, Novartis, Recursion and More\n\nKronos Bio\n\nNov. 27\n\nKronos Bio on Wednesday announced that it will trim its headcount by approximately 83% by the end of the year, as part of a previously announced cost-cutting campaign.\n\nKronos had 62 full-time employees\u2014and one part-time staff member\u2014as of March 11, 2024, according to an SEC filing. After the layoffs, the California-based biotech will have around 10 staff left. President and CEO Norbert Bischofberger is also stepping down from his role, effective Dec. 3, and will be succeeded by current COO and CFO Deborah Knobelman. Bischofberger will stay on Kronos\u2019 Board of Directors.\n\nThe company first announced its corporate overhaul earlier this month, alongside its third-quarter 2024 business report. At the time, Kronos said that it was exploring strategic alternatives moving forward, which could include a merger or reverse merger, an acquisition or other business combination, sales of its assets or other strategic transactions.\n\nKronos also at the time terminated the development of its CDK9 inhibitor istisociclib after disappointing Phase I/II data in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer.\n\nNovartis\n\nNov. 27\n\nAmidst a years-long restructuring effort, Novartis on Tuesday announced it will lay off nearly 140 more employees from in its New Jersey site, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) update.\n\nThe layoffs will start in February 2025 and run through August. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a company spokesperson confirmed the cuts and said that it will primarily affect commercial field sales teams for Xolair, Tafinlar and Mekinist. The spokesperson nevertheless maintained that these medicines will remain available to patients.\n\nNovartis in April 2022 announced a massive business transformation initiative, with an eye toward saving around $1 billion in operations costs through 2024. This effort included thousands of layoffs\u2014in June 2022, the pharma announced that up to 8,000 jobs were on the chopping block. In September 2023, Novartis also confirmed plans to spin off its generics unit Sandoz.\n\nThe layoffs come as Novartis ramps up its pipeline investments, including the potentially $1.1 billion acquisition of gene therapy specialist Kate Therapeutics to deepen its neuromuscular expertise, and the a radiopharma deal with Ratio Therapeutics, which could reach up to $745 million.\n\nRecursion Therapeutics\n\nNov. 27\n\nJust months after revealing its merger with fellow AI leader Exscientia, Recursion Therapeutics on Tuesday announced that it will lay off dozens of employees to minimize redundancies, according to a STAT News report.\n\nCiting a source who had been terminated, STAT noted that cuts were made across both Recursion and Exscientia. Spokesperson Ryan Kelly confirmed the workforce reduction, disclosing that less than 20% of employees were affected. Together, Recursion and Exscientia had a headcount of around 800, according to a press release last week announcing the completion of the acquisition agreement.\n\n\u201cWith any merger, there are bound to be some redundancies and leadership changes,\u201d Kelly told STAT.\n\nRecursion and Exscientia first announced the merger in August 2024, which created a combined company carrying Recursion\u2019s name with around $850 million in cash and cash equivalents\u2014plus $100 million in annual synergies\u2014which could support the combined entity into 2027. Both companies also have outstanding contracts that could yield additional milestone payments from powerhouse partners, including Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Roche and Bayer.\n\nIn total, the combined company is looking at more than 10 clinical and preclinical pipeline programs, on top of 10 advanced discovery programs and over 10 partnered programs. Many trials of its clinical candidates are expected to read out in the next 18 months.\n\nMedigene\n\nNov. 26\n\nMedigene on Tuesday kicked off a broad organizational realignment campaign as it struggles to find the resources to support its operations into 2026.\n\nPart of this program is a steep workforce reduction. Around 40% of the German biotech\u2019s employees will be let go in 2025\u2014a \u201cdifficult decision to make,\u201d according to CEO Selwyn Ho, who nevertheless noted that the layoffs are \u201ca necessary step to ensure the long-term success of Medigene.\u201d\n\nThe company will retain employees whose roles are critical for its new direction of focusing on R&D activities with the greatest potential for return on investment, as per the biotech\u2019s news release.\n\nMedigene on Tuesday also maintained its full-year 2024 guidance, including its prior estimation that its current cash runway will keep it afloat into July 2025. \u201cThe Company continues to evaluate all appropriate financing and strategic options to advance its cash runway into 2026 and beyond,\u201d according to the news release.\n\nIn 2025, Medigene will focus its resources on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided therapies, optimized for sensitivity, specificity and safety, designed specifically for use in off-the-shelf modalities. The biotech will also prioritize its TCR-guided T cell engager MDG3010 in partnership with WuXi Biologics.\n\nAlector\n\nNov. 26\n\nAlector will let go of 41 employees\u2014or around 17% of its total headcount\u2014after revealing disappointing Phase II findings for its Alzheimer\u2019s disease antibody AL002 on Monday.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a sweeping realignment initiative, which Alector will implement to better align its resources with its new strategic priorities. Moving forward, the biotech will focus on its progranulin programs latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, which are being developed for frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the workforce reduction, Alector expects to absorb a one-time cost of $3.9 million, associated mostly with severance payments and other related expenses. According to an SEC filing on Monday, the layoffs will take place in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector had $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the biotech expects will give it enough runway through 2026.\n\nAlector was down 31% in after-hours trading on Monday, in reaction to its Alzheimer\u2019s readout.\n\nBMS\n\nNov. 26\n\nAs part of its drive to lower expenditure by around $1.5 billion through 2025, Bristol Myers Squibb announced plans to lay off around 195 more employees from its Lawrenceville, New Jersey sites.\n\nThe terminations will start on Feb. 13, 2025 and run through the end of next year, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification record. This latest round of workforce reductions brings BMS\u2019s layoff total to nearly 1,330 this year. The job cuts started in March 2024, with 75 employees terminated. The pharma\u2019s largest layoff round came in May 2024 and affected nearly 780 members of its staff.\n\nBMS first announced its sweeping strategic initiative alongside its first-quarter earnings report in April 2024, noting that it plans to reduce management layers and streamline decision-making throughout the company. Core to this push is a headcount reduction of around 2,200 by the end of the year.\n\nThe pharma then intends to use its savings to prioritize R&D programs with the greatest return-on-investment potential, as well as those that could set it up for long-term growth. CEO Chris Boerner said at the time that these business adjustments will help BMS become \u201cmore agile\u201d and \u201cdrive efficiency across the company.\u201d\n\nThe cost cuts appear to be working. In both Q2 and Q3, the pharma beat analyst expectations, with revenues buoyed by the strong sales of products such as Eliquis and Opdivo. The pharma has also consistently raised its full-year earnings guidance\u2014further evidence of the business\u2019 robust performance.\n\nSonata Therapeutics\n\nNov. 22\n\nTo streamline its organization around its most immediate priorities, Sonata Therapeutics is parting with about 20 employees, Fierce Biotech reported.

Chairman David Khougazian is now acting CEO.\n\nSonata did not tell Fierce whether it would deprioritize any of its programs. The company has been developing a new class of therapeutics\u2014which it calls network medicines\u2014meant to reprogram diseased cells to release therapeutic signals. In March, Sonata announced a research collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation to develop SNT-3012, the biotech\u2019s novel network medicine intended to treat pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, Sonata has 54 employees and five investors, including Flagship Pioneering and Altitude Life Science Ventures. The company launched in 2022 after two Flagship companies, Inzen Therapeutics and Cygnal Therapeutics, combined.\n\n23andMe\n\nNov. 22\n\nShortly after announcing it\u2019s laying off more than 200 employees, 23andMe filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices indicating it\u2019s letting go 153 employees in California and closing its South San Francisco location. The staff cuts are likely part of the previously announced workforce reduction.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 19 WARN notices, the genetic testing company will trim its workforce by 122 employees in Sunnyvale and 31 employees in South San Francisco, effective Jan. 10. The 65,340-square-foot South San Francisco location, listed as 23andMe\u2019s headquarters in a May SEC filing, will close.\n\n23andMe announced it\u2019s letting go more than 200 people Nov. 11, when it also shared that it is discontinuing development of new therapies to focus on genetic testing services and products. The company is exploring strategic opportunities for its therapeutic pipeline that could include licensing agreements, asset sales or other transactions.\n\nJ&J and Merck\n\nNov. 21\n\nDue to growing competition from rivals in China, Johnson & Johnson and Merck are letting go employees in that country, BNN Bloomberg reported, crediting Chinese media outlets as the first to cover the cuts. The J&J layoffs mainly affect a division that sells products used in surgery, while Merck is trimming its diabetes unit, sources told BNN Bloomberg.\n\nChinese media outlets reported the J&J cuts will affect as much as a fifth of the pharma\u2019s mainland workforce. A company spokesperson told BNN Bloomberg that J&J \u201chas recently implemented organizational changes to optimise our business operations.\u201d BNN Bloomberg did not report the number of employees affected at Merck.\n\nThe layoffs in China are not the only ones affecting the J&J workforce as 2024 winds down.

The cuts are likely part of an unspecified number of layoffs the company confirmed to BioSpace Nov. 14 that involve the company and its subsidiary, Kite Pharma. A Gilead spokesperson attributed the workforce reductions to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nGilead\u2019s layoffs that will be effective in 2025 are now known to involve at least two states, as a Washington WARN notice revealed that 72 employees in Seattle will be let go starting Jan. 17. That site, which focuses on the company\u2019s research and clinical development activities, is closing. Kite Pharma, meanwhile, will shut down its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025, Fierce Biotech reported last week.\n\nFor more details about the Gilead and Kite layoffs, read the article.\n\nAdaptimmune\n\nNov. 18\n\nAs it redefines itself into what CEO Adrian Rawcliffe last week called a \u201csarcoma-focused business,\u201d Adaptimmune is reducing its workforce by approximately 33% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a wider cost-cutting program that the biotech expects will lower its total operating expenses by around 25% in the first year of implementation. Under this savings initiative, Adaptimmune will also end enrollment in the Phase II SURPASS-3 trial of uza-cel, its next-generation investigational TCR T cell therapy being trialed for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nAdaptimmune\u2019s business realignment comes after it last week announced a pivotal win for its TCR T cell therapy lete-cel in advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In the IGNYTE-ESO study, 42% of the 64 treated patients responded to lete-cel, including six who achieved complete response. Median duration of response reached 18.3 months in synovial sarcoma patients.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2028, Adaptimmune expects its aggregate savings to reach around $300 million, excluding one-time costs associated with the terminations. This money will allow the biotech to focus on its synovial sarcoma business, including the launch of Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel) and the development of lete-cel. Adaptimmune projects combined U.S. peak year sales of $400 million for both assets.\n\nAdaptimmune employed 449 staffers by the end of 2023, according to its year-end report.\n\nGilead Sciences and Kite Pharma\n\nNov. 15\n\nGilead Sciences and subsidiary Kite Pharma are laying off employees, including 72 people effective Jan. 17 at Gilead\u2019s Seattle location, which will close, according to a Nov. 13 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice.

The Rockville, Maryland\u2013based company will also close its research site in Rockville. The moves are expected to extend Sensei\u2019s cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.\n\nAccording to the announcement, most of Sensei\u2019s employee cuts will come in its preclinical research and development group. A Nov. 14 SEC filing stated the company should mostly complete the workforce reduction by the end of 2024. Once the layoffs are complete, the biotech could have about 15 employees given it had 27 full-time employees and one part-time staff member as of Feb. 23, according to a Feb. 22 SEC filing.\n\nSensei\u2019s SNS-101 inhibitor is a conditionally active antibody designed to selectively target the immune checkpoint VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell Activation) within the tumor microenvironment.

In the Oct. 24 call, the company\u2019s CEO, Steve Cutler, shared the business is \u201clooking at where we have an excess of people in certain areas\u201d and \u201ctaking fairly decisive actions.\u201d ICON has locations in 45 countries, including the U.S., where it has offices in 11 states.\n\nICON\u2019s third-quarter revenue of $2.03 million, a 1.2% year-over-year decrease, failed to meet expectations for three reasons, according to the company\u2019s earnings announcement. The CRO cited material headwinds from two large customers undergoing budget cuts and development model changes; lower than anticipated vaccine-related activity; and \u201congoing cautiousness\u201d from biotech customers, resulting in award and study delays.\n\nThe company also noted in its announcement that it expects an \u201coutlook for growth over the medium term\u201d and that its year-to-date revenue is $6.24 million, a year-over-year increase of 3.1%, or 3.2% on a constant currency basis.\n\nMarinus Pharmaceuticals\n\nOct. 25\n\nFollowing a disappointing Phase III trial of ganaxolone to treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), Marinus Pharmaceuticals is laying off employees as part of cost-cutting measures, the company announced Oct. 24.

However, that number is likely lower now, as Marinus announced in May that it would reduce its workforce by about 20% as part of cost-cutting measures at that time.\n\nIn its Oct. 24 announcement, Marinus noted that the Phase III TrustTSC trial evaluating oral ganaxolone did not meet the primary endpoint of percent change in 28-day TSC-associated seizure frequency. It added that while reductions in seizure frequency favored the ganaxolone arm, the primary endpoint failed to achieve statistical significance.\n\nPfizer\n\nOct. 23\n\nAt Pfizer, another group of employees is paying the price for the company\u2019s recent Phase III Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) failure.\n\nThe layoffs, which will affect 75 workers at Pfizer\u2019s Sanford, North Carolina, site, come four months after the company\u2019s investigational DMD therapy, fordadistrogene movaparvovec, failed to meet the primary efficacy endpoint in a Phase III trial. Pfizer said the cuts are related to that trial failure, according to Fierce Pharma.\n\nThis latest wave of layoffs follows the elimination of 150 positions in Sanford immediately after the Phase III DMD readout. This is also the second round of layoffs in as many weeks at Pfizer after the company handed out 80 layoff notices at its McPherson, Kansas, facility on Oct. 16 and Oct. 17.\n\nPfizer\n\nOct. 22\n\nPfizer handed out 80 layoff notices last Wednesday and Thursday at its McPherson, Kansas, facility, where around 1,800 people are employed, multiple local outlets reported.

Allen told KSN that more and more manufacturing companies are making such cuts. \u201cThis time of year seasonally is obviously a time when employers will do their internal audits and see what their staffing looks like,\u201d Allen said.\n\nThis is Pfizer\u2019s second round of layoffs this month.

The cuts will include roughly 55% of the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech\u2019s R&D workforce and five members of its leadership team.

            "content": "Dublin, Dec. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Oncology Pharmaceuticals Market\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global market for oncology pharmaceuticals was valued at $196.4 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.7% to reach $401.4 billion by the end of 2029.\n\nThis report seeks to deliver an in-depth analysis of the worldwide oncology pharmaceuticals (cancer medications) market. It includes a thorough overview of various types of oncology drugs, such as targeted therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy, and an examination of current and historical market revenues.\n\nSeveral factors make the oncology pharmaceutical industry a prime candidate for growth. The oncology pharmaceuticals market is a dynamic and quickly changing sector within the global pharmaceuticals industry. The main priorities of this market are the development, manufacture, and marketing of medications used to treat cancer. It is anticipated to keep expanding due to continuous scientific and technological breakthroughs. Novel immunotherapies and CAR-T cell therapy are emerging treatments that can completely transform how cancer is treated. However, to ensure that new therapies help a wide range of patients, it will be imperative to address issues about drug affordability and accessibility.\n\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry's pipeline and portfolio in oncology is among the most diverse due to its strong emphasis on research. Over time, improved methods of screening, diagnosis, surgery, and radiation therapy, along with rapidly growing options for systemic treatment, have improved the prognosis for many cancers.\n\n\n\nGlobal funding for cancer research has increased dramatically over the past 20 years, and the rate at which new drugs are being developed has not slowed. The FDA approved 161 new cancer therapeutics between 2017 and 2022 for various solid tumor malignancies and indications. The arsenal of cancer treatments is growing at a very rapid pace, which has led to a significant increase in treatment and regulatory complexity. Cancer treatment is now far more expensive for patients and healthcare systems due to the high cost of many new medications. These difficulties and expenses go beyond solid adult cancers to the pediatric and hematology/oncology fields.\n\n\n\nTargeted therapy holds a significant market share regarding medication class, and new precision medicine techniques are emerging from an improved molecular understanding of cancer. As the incidence of breast cancer rises worldwide, pharmaceutical companies are focusing more and more on early diagnosis and treatment options.\n\n\n\nReport Scope\n\n\n\nThe oncology pharmaceuticals market is further categorized by indication, including lung cancer, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and other types of cancer. Additionally, the report presents the market revenue for each geographic region, including North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Rest of the World (RoW).\n\n\n\nIn order to provide an in-depth understanding of the market, this report also includes profiles of market participants, the competitive landscape, key competitors, and respective market share/ranking. This report includes an oncology pharmaceuticals pipeline analysis, patent analysis, and a detailed discussion of key marketed products. This report outlines the driving and restraining factors of the oncology pharmaceuticals market.\n\n\n\nBy geography, the market in this report is segmented into four regions: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Rest of the World (RoW). For market estimates, data has been provided for 2023 as the base year, with forecasts for 2024 through 2029.\n\n\n\nThe report includes:\n\n70 data tables and 50 additional tables\n\nAnalysis of the global market for oncology pharmaceuticals (cancer drugs)\n\nAnalyses of global market trends, with market revenue data from 2022 to 2023, estimates for 2024, forecast for 2025, and projected CAGRs through 2029\n\nAn assessment of the different oncology pharmaceutical types (targeted therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy) and their current and historical market revenues\n\nEstimate of the current market size and revenue prospects, along with a market share analysis by drug type, disease indication (application type), and region\n\nFacts and figures pertaining to the market dynamics, technological advances, regulations, and the macroeconomic factors that influence the industry\n\nA Porter's Five Forces model, and global supply chain and PESTLE analyses\n\nAn analysis of the key products on the market and promising new pipeline molecules or drugs under development\n\nA look at the recent patent grants\n\nOverview of sustainability trends and ESG developments, with emphasis on consumer attitudes, ESG score analysis, and the ESG practices of leading companies\n\nAnalysis of the industry structure, including companies' market shares, strategic alliances, M&A activity and a venture funding outlook\n\nCompany profiles of major players within the industry, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Merck & Co.

            "content": "House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has no doubt had a turbulent year as the leader of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, but any effort to replace him with someone else will not create smoother sailing.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump made clear that any effort to replace Johnson as House speaker lacks his support. In a lengthy post on Truth Social, Trump again endorsed Johnson for the top job, even after a messy fight over government spending and the debt ceiling created feelings of discontent within the Republican conference.\n\nJohnson \u201cwill do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMike has my Complete and Total Endorsement.\u201d\n\nBy endorsing Johnson, Trump is shrewdly helping head off challenges to the speaker\u2019s bid for another term. The new Congress is set to be sworn in Friday, and next Monday, the House and the Senate are set to meet for a joint session to certify Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election.\n\nTo win another term as speaker, Johnson needs to secure the support of 218 members of the House. Republicans hold a razor-thin majority with 220 seats, meaning that the speaker can only afford two defections. Already on the list of defectors is Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who said he would not support Johnson and that the party needs a new leader to implement Trump\u2019s agenda. Other members, including Reps. Victoria Spartz (R-IN), Eli Crane (R-AZ), Scott Perry (R-PA), and Chip Roy (R-TX), have indicated that their support for Johnson is not guaranteed.\n\nBut no matter how dissatisfied with Johnson the malcontent caucus of the Republican conference may be, there is simply no alternative candidate with a viable path to the speakership. These lawmakers can stand on principle all they want, but they will only succeed in delaying the swearing-in of Congress, delaying the certification of the presidential election, and delaying the legislative process of the first Republican trifecta government since the end of the 115th Congress in 2019.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nIf Trump and Republicans are to succeed in their policy goals, they need to take power with as few roadblocks as possible. At this late stage, there simply is no other viable plan to elect a speaker in time for the Monday electoral vote certification, especially because the state funeral of the late former President Jimmy Carter is scheduled for Jan. 9, 2025. From then on, it is a sprint to Jan. 20, when Trump is set to be inaugurated as the nation\u2019s 47th president.\n\nDespite his faults, blocking Johnson from the speakership this week is a recipe for disaster that the Republican majorities in Congress and the incoming Trump administration cannot afford.",

            "content": "Innovation remains at the forefront as companies look to fill gaps left by expiring patents. However, competition in profitable areas like oncology and immunology is fierce, leading to price pressures even before generics or biosimilars hit the market. On the flip side, the success of GLP-1 receptor agonists is sparking renewed interest in general medicines, with companies racing to tap into the $200 billion market. Additionally, about 20% of companies are adjusting their portfolios to focus on high-potential candidates and better meet market demands. Advanced therapies like cell and gene therapies are also gaining attention, with a shift away from more traditional drugs.\n\nAs executives prepare for 2025, drug pricing and access remain their top concerns, according to a Deloitte survey. The survey highlighted that primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. This has executives expecting a surge in mergers and acquisitions in 2025.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, EY believes that the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity, especially if interest rates remain low. There may be a rise in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, although smaller, strategic deals are likely to persist. Politically, the US policy environment is shifting with potential impacts on business, including lower corporate taxes and deregulation, but also the possibility of higher tariffs and continued drug pricing reforms. Changes in immigration and leadership within health agencies could also affect the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, with new appointees potentially disrupting the regulatory landscape.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry in 2024 faced a relatively quiet year, with deal volumes similar to 2023 but lower deal values, reflecting a shift toward smaller, more strategic transactions. Despite challenges such as patent expirations and market uncertainty, innovation remains strong, and there is a better investment environment for biotech. Lower interest rates have also eased capital costs, contributing to increased mergers and acquisitions activity. Biotech IPOs and venture capital investments are seeing a slight recovery, though investment is more concentrated in established companies. However, major pharmaceutical companies face a $300 billion growth gap due to patent expirations, making dealmaking crucial for future growth.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy In 2024 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other pharma dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn addition to the competitive landscape, life sciences companies are also keeping a close eye on regulatory changes. In the United States, concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act are growing, while in Europe, shifts in clinical trial regulations could add complexity. As a result, life sciences companies are preparing for a year of both innovation-driven growth and regulatory challenges.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we reviewed Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database to identify pharmaceutical dividend stocks that hedge funds favored the most.

            "content": "PF Chaney Johnson (Steven Leonard/Auburn Tigers)\n\nAUBURN \u2014 Two days after Auburn\u2019s 6-point road loss at Duke, the Tigers were scheduled to return to the main floor at Neville Arena for practice.\n\nBefore Auburn got there as a team, though, Chaney Johnson was already hard at work. He went through a workout, aided by assistant coach Ira Bowman and director of player development Marquis Daniels. Johnson was drenched in sweat well before the Tigers actually practiced, meticulously working on his offensive game.\n\nA few hours later, shortly after Auburn\u2019s team practice came to a close, Johnson was right back on the floor. Even though he had already had his own individual workout \u2014 something that was pointed out to him by a staff member \u2014 Johnson wasn\u2019t done yet.\n\nJohnson had held his own defensively against potential No. 1 overall NBA Draft pick Cooper Flagg at Duke. But he went 2-7 from the field, something that was still stuck with him more than two days later.\n\nSo Johnson repped shot after shot, move after move, action after action. And it was all nothing new for the former Division II forward. Since he arrived at Auburn, this massive amount of extra work on his own has become routine.\n\n\u201cI very rarely will say that a particular player works harder than anybody else,\u201d Auburn head coach Bruce Pearl said recently. \u201cI\u2019ll always say, \u2018One of our hardest-working players.\u2019 And our kids are a really hard-working team. But Chaney is just next-level.\u201d\n\nThrough 12 games this season, it\u2019s safe to say all that hard work has paid off for Johnson \u2014 particularly on the offensive end of the floor.\n\nWhile Johnson isn\u2019t a member of Auburn\u2019s regular starting lineup due to the Tigers\u2019 desire to get both All-American superstar Johni Broome and fifth-year defensive standout Dylan Cardwell on the floor at the same time, he gets comparable playing time to the likes of Chad Baker-Mazara and Miles Kelly.\n\nPlaying most of the power forward minutes for Auburn this season was always going to be a massive task for whoever filled the spot. Up until recently, Jaylin Williams had played in more games than anyone in program history, and he averaged 12.4 points per night on some ultra-efficient shooting numbers.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, averaged just 4.7 points per game off the bench in his first season after transferring from Division II program Alabama-Huntsville. His overall numbers were fine for a reserve, but there were questions from Auburn fans about his ability to step up and replace Williams \u2014 even if the Tigers could (and did) get even more out of Broome this season.\n\nThose questions have been answered. Against one of the toughest non-conference schedules in the entire country, Johnson is averaging double figures for the Tigers. His points per 40 minutes have climbed from 12.5 to 18.3, which ranks fourth among Auburn\u2019s regular rotation players this season.\n\nJohnson is shooting 73% on 2-point field goal attempts this season, which is almost 10% higher than Broome and also ranks inside the top 30 of all qualified Division I players. Additionally, his assist rate has almost doubled from 8.4% to 15.6%. When the ball is in his hands, Johnson looks like he\u2019s in total control.\n\n\u201cI feel like last year, my first year in D-1, I was jittery, not really allowing the game to come to me,\u201d Johnson said two weeks ago. \u201cMy mind was working 100 miles an hour. I feel like now, I'm basically the dictator. Dribble, dribble, oh, they come past me? I'm dribbling. They're not doubling? I'm dictating the pace I want to play.\u201d\n\nA season ago, Johnson showed flashes of potential excellence. Now, he\u2019s one of the most important pieces of an Auburn offense that has a chance to shatter efficiency records.\n\nAccording to CBB Analytics, Auburn\u2019s nation\u2019s-best offensive rating jumps an additional 18.4 points when Johnson is on the floor. That is the highest mark on the team \u2014 ahead of Broome, ahead of Baker-Mazara, ahead of Tahaad Pettiford.\n\nThat means Auburn is at its absolute best on offense when Johnson plays.",

The couple welcomed their son Jesse Wayne in 1982 \u2014 and Johnson later told PEOPLE that he credited the newborn boy with saving his life.\n\nIn 1989, Johnson became a dad for the second time when he welcomed his first daughter with Melanie Griffith. Johnson and Griffith had been married and divorced over a decade earlier, but reconciled in 1989. Just months after the couple remarried, the actress gave birth to Dakota Mayi.\n\nWhile Johnson ultimately split with Griffith, he found love again with his wife, Kelley Phleger. After the couple tied the knot in 1999, they welcomed three children \u2014 Atherton Grace, Jasper Breckenridge and Deacon James. Johnson admitted that he was more relaxed with his younger children, but was just as excited about adding to the family.\n\n\"I love kids, so it's more good times, more joy and more fun. It's no less exciting this time than it was the first time,\" Johnson shared with OK! Magazine following the birth of his youngest son in 2006.\n\nHere's everything to know about Don Johnson's five children: Jesse, Dakota, Atherton, Jasper and Deacon.\n\nJesse Wayne Johnson, 42\n\nDon Johnson and Jesse Johnson at the premiere of 'The Hateful Eight'. Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic\n\nJohnson became a dad for the first time with his then-partner Patti D'Arbanville when they welcomed their only child together, Jesse Wayne Johnson, on Dec. 7, 1982, in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the 70s, Johnson dealt with drug and alcohol addiction. The actor credited welcoming the little boy with changing his life for the better.\n\n\"I walked into the breakfast room one morning and the sun was shining and the birds were singing, and Patti was feeding the baby,\" he told PEOPLE in 1984. \"I came staggering in and sat down and looked at them, and she looked at me and I knew that if I didn't do something she was going to leave. So I said, 'Patti, I'm a drunk and a drug addict, and I'm going to do something about it.' \"\n\nJohnson later went to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and, 45 days later, became sober.\n\nIn a 2009 interview with Top Cat Films, Jesse shared that he grew up in Aspen, Colorado, where he discovered his love of the outdoors and sports like snowboarding and ice hockey. While he didn't venture into Hollywood until adulthood, he joined his family on the red carpet occasionally.\n\nJesse was the first of Johnson's children to follow in his footsteps in the entertainment industry. He studied theater at Occidental College in L.A., graduating in 2004 before pursuing an acting career. He made his debut when he was just a teenager, taking a small role in his dad's hit TV series Nash Bridges. Since then, he has appeared in several other projects, including Hawaii Five-0, Twin Peaks, Grey's Anatomy and NCIS.\n\nJesse is also a musician \u2014 in 2020, he posted a throwback photo of himself playing guitar in 1998. In October 2020, his band Blame Baby released their debut EP titled Honest Answers To Your Most Private Questions. A year later, Jesse teamed up with two friends to release Tr\u00e9sjet\u00e9, a collection of songs.\n\nDakota Mayi Johnson, 35\n\nDon Johnson and Dakota Johnson attend The Hollywood Foreign Press Association and The Hollywood Reporter party at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival. Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty\n\nJohnson and then-wife Griffith welcomed their daughter, Dakota Mayi, on Oct. 4, 1989, in Austin, Texas. According to UPI, Johnson was in the Lone Star State working on his movie Hot Spot, and when filming wrapped, the family returned to L.A. \u2014 although they weren't there for long.\n\nIn 2017, Dakota told Vogue that she didn't have much stability in her early life as she often traveled with her actor parents around the world for months at a time. Without \"an anchor\" anywhere, she was \"consistently unmoored and discombobulated.\" By the time she was 3, she was already in therapy.\n\n\"I feel like I grew up in the circus. I know planes, trains and automobiles. And really talented, weird people,\" Dakota told Another Magazine in 2015 about her childhood.\n\nWhen she wasn't on the road, she split time between Griffith's L.A. home and Johnson's Colorado ranch \u2014 and she occasionally spent time at her grandmother Tippi Hedren's big cat sanctuary in the California desert. She finally remained in one place for a few consecutive years after enrolling at a private school in Santa Monica, California.\n\nAt 12, Dakota became interested in modeling when she took part in a Teen Vogue photo shoot with other children of celebrities, she recalled to Aspen Peak magazine in 2008. She eventually signed up with the modeling agency IMG and began working as a model while she was still in high school.\n\nIn 2006, she followed in her mother's footsteps as Miss Golden Globe \u2014 the first second-generation child to hold the title.\n\nDakota made her film debut with her mother in Crazy in Alabama in 1999. While her parents discouraged her from pursuing acting seriously, Dakota pushed forward and applied to Juilliard to study the art, she shared on Late Night with Seth Meyers. She wasn't accepted into the program, and as a result Johnson financially cut her off, since his stipulation for being on his \"payroll\" was that she was in school.\n\nDakota then moved to West Hollywood, California, and began auditioning. It didn't take long to land her first big role as Sean Parker's one-night stand in The Social Network.\n\nFrom there, Dakota's career took off, and she appeared in films like 21 Jump Street and The Five-Year Engagement; she also landed a starring role in the short-lived TV series Ben and Kate. Dakota's breakthrough moment came in 2013 when she was cast as Anastasia Steele in Fifty Shades of Grey.\n\nSince skyrocketing to fame in the romantic drama, Dakota has kept a packed schedule with appearances in movies like The Peanut Butter Falcon, Bad Times at the El Royale and Suspiria. In fact, Johnson once said that he and Dakota hadn't seen each other in a while because she was just too busy.\n\n\"She doesn't really call me for advice. She calls me to say, 'Gosh, I would see you, but I've got three pictures that I'm shooting at the same time,' \" he said on Late Night with Seth Meyers in 2021.\n\nWhile Johnson may not get as much quality time with Dakota as he used to, in 2016, he told E! News that he was \"super proud\" of everything she had accomplished \u2014 both on and off the screen. In 2021, Johnson shared in an interview on Good Day New York that he gave his seal of approval to Dakota's longtime boyfriend, Coldplay's Chris Martin, whom she began dating in 2017.\n\nAtherton Grace Johnson, 25\n\nDon Johnson and Grace Johnson at the \"Watchmen\" premiere. Frazer Harrison/Getty\n\nJohnson and wife Kelley Phleger welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Atherton Grace, or just \"Grace,\" on Dec. 28, 1999.\n\nGrace spent most of her childhood out of the spotlight, having grown up in Santa Barbara, California, per Santa Barbara Magazine. As a kid, she was rarely spotted with her famous family. Grace went on to study photography at the University of Southern California, a passion which was inspired by her grandmother, she told Glamour Spain.\n\nGrace has also shown off her skills in front of the camera, signing with IMG and making her runway debut in the Christian Cowan x The Powerpuff Girls show in 2019. That year, she also attended the Met Gala with her sister Dakota, whom she has called her \"best friend.\"\n\n\"My relationship with Dakota is a mix because she is not just my sister, she is my best friend. For a long time, regardless of the age difference, she has always treated me as an equal,\" Grace told Glamour Spain.\n\nSince her runway debut, Grace has made major strides in her career, having appeared on the cover of Bello magazine and walked the runway in Gucci's 2021 Love Parade show. Grace was also featured in the campaign for Goop's collaboration with Banana Republic and even made a cameo in her brother Jesse's music video for the song \"Headcase.\"\n\nJasper Breckenridge Johnson, 22\n\nNoel Vasquez/GC Images\n\nJohnson and Phleger's second child, Jasper Breckenridge, was born on June 6, 2002. Throughout his upbringing in Santa Barbara, Jasper remained private, dedicating much of his time to sports. In high school, he played basketball on the varsity team starting in his freshman year.\n\nHe told the college sports recruiting organization NCSA that his parents had never missed a game. His brother Jesse was sure to catch a few as well: he captured Jasper shooting the winning basket during a game in January 2020.\n\nJasper graduated from high school in 2021. Ahead of his graduation, he wrote that he hoped to pursue a business major at a four year college.\n\nDeacon James Johnson, 18\n\nKelley Johnson Instagram\n\nJohnson and Phleger welcomed their youngest child, Deacon James, on April 29, 2006 \u2014 the same day as the couple's seventh wedding anniversary. Following Deacon's birth, Johnson's rep said he was \"over the moon times six.\"\n\nLike his older siblings, Deacon grew up in Santa Barbara, where he graduated from middle school in 2020, according to Phleger's Instagram. His parents have also shared posts featuring their son playing both the piano and guitar.\n\nThe youngest Johnson has also followed in his older brother's footsteps with his love of sports \u2014 he has often attended football and baseball games with his dad.\n\nIn 2023, as Deacon began his senior year of high school, Phleger posted a sweet picture of him holding a chalkboard that declared he wants to be an astronaut \"when he grows up.\"",

Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement.\"\n\nThe endorsement is an early win for Johnson, whose speakership hangs in the balance. An endorsement from Trump could persuade hardliners to fall in with Johnson prior to the certification of the 2024 election on Jan. 6.\n\nWith Republicans holding one of the smallest House majorities in history, every single vote counts. If all members are present and voting, Johnson can only afford to lose two members of his conference to retain his gavel when the House returns to session on Friday.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., talks to reporters after passing the funding bill to avert the government shutdown at the Capitol in Washington, Dec. 20, 2024. Jose Luis Magana/AP\n\nBut with the recent resignation of former Rep. Matt Gaetz, the total number of the House will be 434 members with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. This means, Johnson\u2019s can afford only one defection and a second would block him from getting the gavel. At least one Republican has already said he won't support Johnson and others are on the fence.\n\nThe speaker vote comes after several House Republicans grew frustrated with Johnson during the final days of the 118th Congress, which saw a bitter fight over spending that nearly caused a government shutdown before Christmas.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk, who was tapped by Trump to run the new \"Department of Government Efficiency,\u201d started the infighting when he trashed the bipartisan funding bill in a post on X as the House prepared to vote on the measure. Trump later in the day issued a statement opposing the bill and saying he wanted the funding bill to either raise or eliminate the nation's debt ceiling before his inauguration on Jan. 20, a demand that Musk endorsed.\n\nThe bipartisan bill ultimately failed. A bill that included Trump's debt ceiling demands also failed. A third attempt that included $100 billion for disaster aid, $30 billion for farmers and a one-year extension of the farm bill, provisions that were in the original measure, passed 38 minutes past the deadline on Dec. 21.\n\nMusk on Monday also backed Johnson, writing on X, \"I feel the same way! You have my full support,\" in response to Johnson thanking Trump for his endorsement.\n\nNotably, neither Trump or Musk's endorsements mentioned the debt ceiling, but their backing was welcome news for Johnson.\n\nIn his post, Trump also boasted about his successful 2024 White House run, praising Republicans for running a \u201clegendary\u201d campaign while railing against President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHe urged Republicans to \"not blow\" an opportunity for a \"relief\" from the outgoing administration -- calling for Republicans to support Johnson.\n\nBut the announcement from the president-elect didn't dissuade at least one of Johnson's opponents.\n\n\"I respect and support President Trump, but his endorsement of Mike Johnson is going to work out about as well as his endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan,\" Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., wrote on X. \"We\u2019ve seen Johnson partner with the democrats to send money to Ukraine, authorize spying on Americans, and blow the budget.\"\n\nMassie previously told ABC News he would not be voting for Johnson as speaker.\n\nIndiana Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz said she wants \"assurances\" that Johnson can deliver Trump's agenda before she would support him.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump will be able to save America only if we have a speaker with courage, vision and a plan - also public commitment to the American people how he will help deliver President Trump\u2019s agenda to drain the swamp,\u201d Spartz wrote on X after Trump\u2019s endorsement.\n\nShe earlier suggested to Fox News that if Johnson is not willing to deliver on the president-elect\u2019s agenda, he\u2019s not worthy of being elected speaker again.\n\n\u201cIf he wants to be a speaker, he needs to commit publicly how he's going to be fulfilling his constitutional duties,\u201d Spartz said on \"Fox & Friends,\" adding, \u201cI'm not asking him to go beyond what he has to do by Constitution.\u201d\n\nSpartz also said some of her GOP colleagues are interested in the speaker\u2019s gavel, but she wouldn\u2019t reveal which members because they wouldn\u2019t publicly oppose Johnson.",

Let\u2019s get to work!\u201d Johnson wrote on X in response to Trump\u2019s stamp of approval.\n\nTrump\u2019s endorsement of Johnson was a strategic calculation intended to prevent him from getting stymied by a House GOP civil war early on in his next administration, one source close to the president-elect told Semafor.\n\n\u201cHe can bury [Johnson] whenever he wants,\u201d that source said. \u201cGet through Jan. 20, get rolling on the border, rack up some wins, and then use the bully pulpit in full force from there on out.\u201d\n\nThe soon-to-be 47th president had hoped to tie federal spending to an elimination of the debt limit, joining with tech billionaire Elon Musk and fiscal hawks in the House Republican conference to tank earlier drafts of the funding bill.\n\nOn Dec. 20, Congress passed a slimmed-down version of the legislation that excluded the debt ceiling, while still cutting other costly items \u2014 including a 4% pay hike for lawmakers.\n\nIn his post, Trump also knocked Democrats for the \u201cvery expensive\u201d campaigns of their nominees President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and said the pair\u2019s administration had been a \u201csinking ship.\u201d\n\n4 Trump\u2019s endorsement of Johnson comes after a dispute over government funding earlier this month.

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) set to ditch his seat, Johnson will have little room for error. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) already revealed that the speaker did not have his support and others like Reps. Victoria Spartz (R-Ind.) have said they\u2019re on the fence.\n\nMusk, who demonstrated his clout in the lower chamber earlier this month, later suggested he was iffy on Johnson, telling Massie on X, \u201cYou might be right, but let\u2019s see how it goes.\u201d\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s endorsement of Johnson, Gaetz proclaimed that \u201cthe resistance to @SpeakerJohnson is now futile.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s work to make him the best version of himself (which was more like the 2023 vintage of Mike),\u201d he wrote on X.\n\nSpartz, who has threatened to boycott congressional committees and refrain from participating in House GOP caucus meetings, laid out her demands for Johnson on Monday.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we are serious about governing, our next SPEAKER must COMMIT PUBLICLY to create at least temporary structures in the House for: 1) authorizations; 2) reconciliation offset policies, and 3) spending audits,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe also need to engage competent, unbiased \u2018non-swamp\u2019 professionals to help us to at least start getting us gradually out of this serious fiscal mess.\u201d\n\nA potentially protracted delay in anointing the next speaker could pose complications for the certification of Trump\u2019s election victory three days later on Jan. 6, 2025. This is because the lower chamber is not really supposed to do anything other than vote on a speaker when it doesn\u2019t have one.\n\nJohnson has spent ample time with Trump, huddling with him at Mar-a-Lago and attending UFC outings.\n\nOne day before Trump endorsed Johnson, the president-elect trashed the Louisianian\u2019s predecessor, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who was toppled in a mutiny following a nasty spending flap.\n\nWithout mentioning McCarthy by name, Trump described him as a \u201cgood man\u201d but ripped into the debt limit deal he helped broker last year.\n\n\u201cThe extension of the Debt Ceiling by a previous Speaker of the House, a good man and a friend of mine, from this past September of the Biden Administration, to June of the Trump Administration, will go down as one of the dumbest political decisions made in years,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Sundary.\n\n4 Trump called Johnson a \u201cgood, hard working, religious man\u201d in his endorsement post on Truth Social. Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTechnically, the bipartisan compromise that McCarthy helped negotiate \u2014 the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 \u2014 suspended the limit on the nation\u2019s borrowing authority until Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nDue to the various complexities of government financing, including a very slight reduction in the debt next month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced the department will begin undergoing \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d between Jan. 14\u201323, 2015 to help prolong the deadline to address the debt ceiling.\n\nTrump\u2019s team appears to believe those measures will run out by June, giving him just shy of six months to deal with a nasty debt limit fight at a time when he will be hotly pursuing marquee legislation.\n\nAmid heavy pressure from fiscal hawks, McCarthy had gotten into a showdown with the Biden administration on the debt limit in 2023.\n\nDebt limit showdowns are particularly dicey affairs because of the potential to cause the US to default on its debt.\n\nThe negotiated deal featured some modest attempts at reining in spending, including caps on discretionary spending, a clawback of unused COVID-19 funds, work requirements on food stamps and more.\n\nGovernment deficits increased beyond what had generally been expected in the deal, in part due to supplemental foreign aid that later came up.\n\n\u201cThere was no reason to do it \u2013 NOTHING WAS GAINED, and we got nothing for it \u2014 A major reason why that Speakership was lost. It was Biden\u2019s problem, not ours. Now it becomes ours,\u201d Trump ventured on Truth Social Sunday.\n\n\u201cI call it \u20181929\u2019 because the Democrats don\u2019t care what our Country may be forced into. In fact, they would prefer \u2018Depression\u2019 as long as it hurt the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nTrump is inheriting a fiscal storm in his first year in office, with a debt limit fight, multiple government funding battles, the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts, the expiration of an expansion of Affordable Care Act subsidies, and more on the horizon.\n\nAll of that threatens to suck up critical time that Trump and Republicans will need to get through their legislative agenda on key issues such as the border and energy policy.\n\nMoreover, Republicans are particularly divided on how to handle the debt ceiling and government funding situations.\n\nWhen Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance intervened in the government funding fight earlier this month and demanded the GOP address the debt ceiling, over three dozen House Republicans openly defied them and voted down the package they favored, forcing leadership to play ball with Democrats.\n\n4 Trump with Johnson and his wife Kelly Johnson at Mar-a-Lago on Sept. 15, 2024. X/SpeakerJohnson\n\nThat showcased some of the limitations of Trump\u2019s pull within the notoriously recalcitrant House Republican conference.\n\nRepublicans supposedly made a handshake deal to tackle the debt limit later on and slash spending by about $2.5 trillion over a decade during the latest government funding row.\n\nSome Democrats have privately expressed interest in Trump\u2019s desire to eliminate the debt limit outright \u2014 keen on taking a tool away that Republicans have used to vex them in the past.\n\nOne thing Democrats have publicly soured on doing is bailing out Johnson if he fails to whip up the votes needed to lock down the gavel.\n\nThey bailed him out in May over a motion to oust him in response to his decision to take up a vote to replenish aid to war-torn Ukraine.",

            "content": "Tre Johnson stands as one of the top prospects in this draft cycle among the likes of Cooper Flagg and Dylan Harper. The Texas Longhorn guard can provide elite scoring in the mid-range and from three. Like Flagg or Harper, he will be a prize for any team with a lottery pick. Here are the best fits for Tre Johnson among teams currently projected to be in the 2025 NBA Draft lottery.\n\nBest Fits For Tre Johnson Among Lottery Teams\n\nWashington Wizards\n\nOut of all the teams on this list, the Washington Wizards will be the prime landing spot for Tre Johnson and what he brings as a player. Both parties will benefit immensely from the pairing as they can cover each other\u2019s weaknesses. The Wizards need a long-term elite scoring option on the wing and Johnson can provide just that. Unquestionably, his ability to knock down shots from anywhere on the court will help a Wizards team struggling to put the ball in the basket. In particular, the Wizards, at the time of this article, has an offensive rating of 104.7. Undoubtedly, that is the worst out of any team this season. For that reason, Johnson\u2019s inclusion on the roster will make it considerably better.\n\nBy the same token, Johnson will benefit greatly from playing next to guys like Bilal Coulibaly and Alex Sarr. Specifically, Johnson isn\u2019t the best on the defensive end of the floor, so playing next to Sarr and Coulibaly will help him on that end. Given these reasons, the Wizards fit the best for Johnson.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\nNext on the list is the San Antonio Spurs, and they can be a good fit for Johnson. The Spurs need to add more scoring and floor-spacing around Victor Wembanyama and that is something that Johnson can provide. Undeniably, there will be some skill duplication with Devin Vassell. However, the Spurs need another high-level shot creator and shooter next to Wembanyama. On the other end, Wembanyama can be of help to Johnson on defense. Regardless of certain fit concerns, Johnson will fit well in San Antonio if they get him.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans\n\nSimilar to the other teams on this list, the New Orleans Pelicans are a good fit for Johnson. He can be a huge part of the next iteration of the Pelicans, given the franchise\u2019s uncertain future. They need someone who has offensive talent like Johnson and specifically his shot-making ability. Paired with shooters like Trey Murphy III, Herb Jones, and Jordan Hawkins, the Pelicans will have an impressive young core moving forward. Not only that, but those three players can help out Johnson on the defensive end, especially Jones and Hawkins. Those two specifically are talented defensive studs on the wings. Given these reasons, Johnson would fit well in New Orleans.\n\nToronto Raptors\n\nThe Toronto Raptors will be a good landing place for Johnson if they get him in the draft. The Raptors will benefit from Johnson\u2019s ability to make tough shots and knock down threes from deep. While they do have a glut of shooting guards on the roster, Johnson adds a different dynamic than what those players bring. Specifically, Johnson brings his innate scoring and shot-making. Additionally, Toronto needs more perimeter shot-making around Scottie Barnes, and Johnson can bring that. Also, the Raptors have the personnel to cover up Johnson\u2019s weakness on defense and let him focus offensively. Without a doubt, Johnson will be in a good place if he lands with the Raptors.",
