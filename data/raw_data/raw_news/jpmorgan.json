            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nJPMorgan Chase announced changes to its internal practices on diversity, equity and inclusion and its external memberships in climate-related organizations Friday.\n\nThe bank said it would rebrand its DEI practices \u201cDOI,\u201d with \u201co\u201d standing for opportunity, according to an internal memo seen Friday by ESG Dive. Additionally, JPMorgan Asset Management has left the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative, a spokesperson for the bank said in an emailed statement. NZAM paused its operations , pending a review of its programs, after BlackRock left the group in January.\n\nJPMorgan is not the only bank to embrace \u201copportunity\u201d as an alternative to DEI. In its annual report this year, Bank of America replaced its \u201cDiversity and Inclusion\u201d with one called \u201cTalent, Inclusion and Opportunity.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFriday\u2019s internal memo from JPMorgan Chief Operating Officer Jennifer Piepszak said the company has made changes to its DEI programs \u201cand the language [JPMorgan uses] to describe them,\u201d including swapping the \u201cequity\u201d for \u201copportunity\u201d and renaming the division to Diversity, Opportunity & Inclusion.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018e\u2019 always meant equal opportunity to [JPMorgan], not equal outcomes, and we believe this more accurately reflects our ongoing approach to reach the most customers and clients to grow our business, create an inclusive workplace for our employees and increase access to opportunities,\u201d Piepszak wrote in the memo.\n\nThe bank said it had \u201cstreamlined\u201d some of the diversity programs that were previously managed by the DEI office, integrating some into the human resources or corporate responsibility parts of the business.\n\nThe changes come as the Trump administration has increasingly put a focus on corporate DEI programs, including an executive order for his agencies to target private-sector initiatives. This has added to the wave of companies who rolled back programs last year, and the pressure has pushed U.S. banks to alter the way they talk about DEI in securities filings.\n\nAmong them, JPMorgan said in its most recent annual filing that it \u201chas been and expects that it will continue to be criticized by activists, politicians and other members of the public\u201d about stances it has taken on public policy matters \u201csuch as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\u201d The firm also re-branded a table with employee breakdowns that was titled \u201cDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\u201d in last year\u2019s filing to \u201cWorkplace Composition.\"\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had previously said \u201cbring them on\u201d to anti-DEI activists that may target his company. He later said in a company town hall that the firm planned to reduce spending on some DEI efforts and said he \u201cwas never a firm believer in bias training,\u201d according to Bloomberg.\n\nPiepszak\u2019s Friday memo said the company plans to reduce its number of trainings, though its employee groups will remain focused on employee engagement, education and cultural celebrations and observances. In looking to increase \u201cconnectivity\u201d between different parts of the business and the DOI group, she said \u201csome activities, councils or chapters may be consolidated to streamline our process and engagement strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201c[JPMorgan] remain[s] committed to our core principles, which includes our belief in the power of a diverse workforce that strengthens our business and attracts and retains the best talent,\u201d Piepszak said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been committed to hiring, compensation and promotion that are merit-based; we do not have illegal quotas or pay incentives, and we would never turn someone away because of their political or religious beliefs, or because of who they are.\u201d\n\nDoubling down on its own language tweaks, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, at a public appearance during the week his company\u2019s annual report was issued, said: \u201cWe have diversity and inclusion at our company ... But, step back: we\u2019ve always been the bank of opportunity.\u201d\n\nLeaving NZAM\n\nAdditionally, a JPMorgan spokesperson said Monday that the firm\u2019s asset management arm is \u201cending its membership\u201d in NZAM, \u201cin light of\u201d the operational pause the initiative announced in January. NZAM had announced the temporary suspension of operations following the departure of the nation\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, earlier that month.\n\nFollowing BlackRock\u2019s exit, NZAM initially said that though it was \u201cdisappointed to see any investor withdraw\u201d it respects any decision signatories make. However, it reversed course and announced a suspension of activities a few days later due to \u201crecent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations.\u201d\n\nThe organization said that during the pause \u2014 which included the suspension of tracking signatory reporting and target implementation \u2014 it would review its operations to make sure the group \u201cremains fit for purpose in the new global context.\u201d\n\nFor JPMorgan, the NZAM exit comes after the bank had previously followed Bank of America, Citi, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo out the door of the UN-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance. At the time, a JPMorgan spokesperson told ESG Dive it still plans to engage with the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net-Zero, which is refocusing on mobilizing capital this year.\n\nNorthern Trust Asset Management has also announced a departure from NZAM following the pause, as well as an exit from Climate Action 100+ \u2014 an investor group that has become a common target for House Republicans.",

            "content": "From Equity to Opportunity: What JPMorgan\u2019s Workforce Data Says About the Real State of Inclusion.\n\nUS-based financial services giant JPMorgan Chase has rebranded its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) strategy to Diversity, Opportunity, and Inclusion (DOI), reflecting what the company calls a more accurate depiction of its approach. While the language shift may seem subtle, the implications are far from minor\u2014especially as businesses across the U.S. recalibrate their DEI efforts under growing political and legal scrutiny.\n\nAccording to JP Morgan, the term \"opportunity\" better captures its long-standing commitment to creating pathways for all, without implying guarantees of outcomes. \u201cTogether, we\u2019re working toward an inclusive culture for our employees and our business,\u201d JPMorgan notes in its public communication around the change. However, as the company transitions from \u2018equity\u2019 to \u2018opportunity,\u2019 a deeper look at its workforce data raises an important question: does the progress on representation align with this evolving narrative?\n\nThe bank\u2019s 2023 Employer Information Report (EEO-1) and Workforce Composition Disclosure offer a revealing snapshot of current demographics and progress\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014on diversity. Senior leadership continues to be dominated by white and male employees, suggesting that access to opportunity may not be translating into equitable advancement for all groups.\n\nRepresentation of Black and Hispanic professionals at executive levels shows only modest year-over-year improvement. In fact, the data reveals that Black and Hispanic men and women combined represent a small fraction of leadership roles, highlighting a persistent gap in upward mobility. For example, among executive/senior officials, only 158 Hispanic or Latino men and 76 women are present\u2014a figure dwarfed by their representation in less senior or administrative roles.\n\nGender disparity also stands out. While women constitute a large share of the total workforce, they are significantly underrepresented at the top. In administrative support roles alone, women hold over 13,000 of the 50,470 positions overall indicating gender clustering in support functions rather than leadership. At the executive team level, women represent just 28%, compared to 72% men. Although 45% of the board of directors are women, and 41% of the operating committee, the gap at the highest tier remains stark.\n\nThese numbers seem to support concerns that changing the language from \u201cequity\u201d to \u201copportunity\u201d could dilute the accountability for outcomes. While \u201copportunity\u201d stresses access, it may not ensure actual progression\u2014particularly for underrepresented groups already facing systemic barriers.\n\nFurthermore, entry-level hiring appears more diverse than the upper echelons, underscoring potential shortcomings in internal promotion pipelines. Without robust mechanisms to develop and advance diverse talent, the commitment to opportunity may fall short of real impact.\n\nAs other corporations watch JPMorgan\u2019s DOI strategy unfold, the broader conversation around diversity is also evolving. In a landscape where DEI programs are increasingly politicised, companies are navigating how to stay committed to inclusion without triggering backlash.\n\nUltimately, JPMorgan\u2019s shift to DOI signals a nuanced pivot in corporate diversity discourse. But for such a rebrand to carry weight, it must be matched by measurable progress\u2014not just in hiring, but in advancement, representation, and culture. The numbers tell a story\u2014and right now, that story still has some unfinished chapters.",

You can do one thing, I can do another. That\u2019s what\u2019s called a free market.\u201d\n\nAttending office important for young workforce\n\nJPMorgan Chase , the America's largest bank, ended hybring working starting Mar 2025. From this month onwards, the company made five days work from office compulsory. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has been a strong advocate of Work from Office, saying that it fosters better learning, innovation and culture. In an internal memo announcing the end of work from home, Jamie Dimon wrote, \"Now is the right time to solidify our full-time in-office approach.\" \"We think it is the best way to run the company,\" Dimon added.JPMorgan Chase's strict stand on working from office has also been a talking point in corporate circles. In a recent address with students at the Stanford University 's Graduate School of Business, Jami Dimon spoke about a range of subjects including his stance on remote work. According t a report in New York Post, Dimon, aged 68, expressed his frustration with virtual working, stating that it \"doesn't work in our business.\" The comment came in response to a student's question about his blunt remarks from a company town hall, where he addressed the bank's decision to end hybrid work arrangements, a practice that has gained popularity since the coronavirus pandemic.Jake Chasan, MBA student at Stanford University, started his career at Goldman Sachs. A day before the event at Stanford, he met with Jamie Dimon. Here\u2019s what Jake had to say after meeting Jamie. \u201cJamie Dimon is down-to-earth in a way that\u2019s unique to him and the learnings from our conversation have already helped shape my own leadership qualities. His paying-it-forward serves as inspiration for me to do the same.\u201dDimon said that he supports remote work where it proves effective and respects employees' rights to prefer it. But at the same time, JP Morgan CEO emphasized that he won't let individual preferences dictate company policy. \u201cWe have 10% of our people working at home full-time,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cWe put virtual call centers in Baltimore and Detroit. We did it to see if they\u2019d be effective. They\u2019re highly effective. They work from home. They\u2019re mostly minorities. That\u2019s why we did it. So I\u2019m not against it where it works \u2026When asked for advice on handling virtual work, Dimon suggested that only \"people in the middle,\" such as corporate office workers, are frustrated with returning to the office. He pointed out that many essential workers, like those in restaurants, never had the option to work remotely. \"Where did you get your Amazon packages from? Your beef, your meat, your vodka? Where did you get the diapers from?\" he asked, highlighting the 60% of Americans who continued working throughout the pandemic, including UPS and FedEx employees, manufacturers, agricultural workers, hospital staff, nurses, sanitation workers, firefighters, and military personnel.In the past, you had more people, more assignments, and more opportunities for casual interactions that foster learning and growth. He explained that with fewer people, you\u2019re put on less assignments, you know less about what\u2019s going on, and there are fewer chances to interact with your colleagues. He also dislikes setups where junior staff are in the office but their managers are not present. He dismissed claims that remote work \u201cworks for me\u201d as insufficient justification for the current setup.Furthermore, the CEO emphasized the significance of face-to-face communication for management and culture-building, which he believes is lacking in virtual settings. He described the dynamic exchanges that occur in person, characterized by constant updates and information sharing. However, he also highlighted distractions, such as phone usage during Zoom meetings, as another drawback of remote work. For Dimon, these factors further solidify his conviction that telework is incompatible with JPMorgan\u2019s operations and culture.In November 2024, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon took to the stage at a conference to express his strong opposition to several major U.S. financial regulatory initiatives. He went on to criticize these initiatives, calling them harmful and pledging to stand against them. Dimon also cautioned that banks are wary of potential regulatory backlash and claimed he had personally been targeted for his criticism.",

This change comes as DEI initiatives face rising scrutiny and criticism, particularly from the Trump administration.\n\nThe change from \u201cequity\u201d to \u201copportunity\u201d is intended to clarify the bank\u2019s focus on equal access rather than equal outcomes.\n\nAs part of other changes, some diversity programs previously managed by the DOI organization will now be overseen by other units like Human Resources and Corporate Responsibility. This aims to streamline processes and get more people involved. Also, JPMorgan plans to reduce the frequency of training on these topics, while focusing on more high-quality offerings.\n\nMajor Companies Scale Back DEI Policies\n\nThis shift is part of a growing trend among major U.S. and European companies. Many have scaled back or changed their DEI policies since President Trump signed an executive order in January. Conservative groups and activists have also put pressure on these companies to revise their DEI plans.\n\nSimilar to JPM, Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) have made similar moves. Citigroup dropped its rule for diverse candidate slates in job interviews and renamed its diversity team. Further, Goldman Sachs removed a board diversity rule and the diversity section in its yearly report.\n\nIs JPM a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, JPM stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys and six Holds assigned in the last three months.

            "content": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nFour years ago, when Charlie Javice began boasting that Frank, her financial aid website, had more than 4 million student users, eyebrows shot up among her co-workers.\n\n\"Do we really have 4.25M students?\" they chatted behind her back on the office messaging app, Slack, during a team meeting in early 2021. \"Is this real?\" one slacked, according to government evidence. \"Why do I feel like it's so much smaller?\"\n\nWhen a Frank worker joked, \"These look like charlie numbers,\" another agreed: \"Charlie is king of finding magic numbers haha.\"\n\nAs early as Thursday, a federal jury in Manhattan will begin weighing fraud and conspiracy charges that carry a potential 30-year prison sentence. The charges allege that Javice, 32, and her top executive at Frank, Olivier Amar, 50, used fake data to trick JPMorgan Chase into buying the website for $175 million.\n\nJurors will be asked to consider many millions of numbers scattered throughout spreadsheets, emails, WhatsApp texts, and Slack messages surrounding the 2021 deal.\n\nUltimately, though, a single \"Charlie number\" \u2014 and whether it was magic or merely misunderstood \u2014 will be at the center of their deliberations.\n\nThat number is 4,265,085.\n\nProsecutors say it's what Javice ultimately settled on when, on July 8, 2021, she told JPMorgan executives how many individuals had used the website over the previous four years to at least begin filling out a FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid.\n\nJavice assured JPMorgan that each of these users had given Frank their first name, last name, email, and phone number, prosecutors said. They said she also told the bank that many of them had additionally given Frank their Social Security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, and details on their income, cash assets, and investments.\n\nAll of this information could be theirs if they purchased Frank, the bank was told \u2014 data points it could use to directly market Chase credit cards and checking accounts to students at the start of their lifelong financial journeys.\n\nA slide from a 60-page pitch deck Frank founder Charlie Javice sent to JPMorgan Chase during 2021 merger negotiations says, \"4.25 million Students trust Frank for all their money needs.\" US Attorney's Office/Business Insider\n\nProsecutors allege that when the bank asked to verify the impressive number, Javice pushed back, citing user privacy and terms-of-service restrictions.\n\nDuring daylong meetings on July 12 and 13, 2021, Javice repeatedly assured the bank that the number represented real Frank users from whom the website had collected at least names, emails, and phone numbers.\n\nJPMorgan Chase kept pressing for proof.\n\nSo Javice and the bank agreed to a compromise \u2014 she would send her 4,265,085 rows of spreadsheet data to a third-party marketing company. The marketing company could review the spreadsheet and assure the bank that the data was all there.\n\nThe trouble, prosecutors allege, was that no such spreadsheet existed. They say that only 293,000 users had ever signed up for a Frank account and submitted their names, emails, and phone numbers to the website. Many of these account holders had never started a FAFSA.\n\nEager to clinch the deal, Javice and Amar were undaunted, prosecutors argued.\n\nAccording to the indictment against them, the two hired an outside company to create a phony spreadsheet whose 4,265,085 rows would mirror the statistical properties of those 293,000 actual users.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege this chart is filled with bogus numbers and was sent by Javice to JPMorgan Chase to help convince the bank to buy her website. US Attorney's Office/Business Insider\n\nProsecutors say this massive Excel spreadsheet was created by an outside company in three days for $18,000 and filled with \"synthetic data\" to clinch the $175 million sale.\n\n\"It was all fake,\" federal prosecutor Micah Festa Fergenson said during Javice's arraignment in April.\n\nThe parties signed a merger agreement in early August 2021. The deal closed a month later. Javice received an immediate $21 million and began collecting on her half-million-dollar annual salary and bonus package.\n\nAs Javice courted potential buyers for Frank, the financial aid website boasted of its 4.25 million student users. US Attorney's Office/Business Insider\n\nJPMorgan, the country's largest bank, purchased Frank without ever setting eyes on the spreadsheet, nevermind vetting its numbers.\n\nInstead, prosecutors allege, the bank relied on Javice's third-party marketing company, which assured that it had counted the rows of data, and, indeed, they numbered 4,265,085.\n\nAfter the merger closed, Javice and Amar knew their new bosses would need real numbers so, prosecutors say, they purchased publicly-available data for four million students, including names, emails, and phone numbers, on the open market for $100,000.\n\nWhen Chase used the data to test-run a marketing campaign, \"a lot of the emails were old and didn't work,\" Fergenson, the prosecutor, said at Javice's arraignment. \"Almost nobody clicked through to it. And it was completely unexpected.\"\n\nA former Frank employee testified Thursday that more than 30% of the emails were invalid. She said only 1% of the people who received the Chase email actually clicked to open it.\n\nUltimately, the test run using Frank's user spreadsheet \u2014 the spreadsheet JPMorgan spent $175 million to access \u2014 resulted in 10 people signing up for a Chase checking account.\n\nThe bank launched an in-house investigation. The Frank website was taken down. JPMorgan fired Javice and Amar in November 2022 and sued them a month later.\n\nThe following April, the US Attorney's Office announced Javice's indictment. On the same day, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced it had filed a civil lawsuit charging her with bank and securities fraud, a case that remains on hold pending the resolution of her criminal case.\n\nJavice arrives at federal court in Manhattan. INSIDER\n\nThey wanted Javice more than her data\n\nIn court papers, opening statements, and arguments throughout a monthlong trial, Javice's attorneys have tipped their hand on several defenses that may find their way into closing arguments scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nThey've argued that for JPMorgan, the Frank deal was more about acquiring Javice \u2014 a promising fintech star and media darling \u2014 than her data.\n\nThe microfinance entrepreneur had made Forbes' \"30 under 30\" list and, at age 28, secured a one-on-one meeting with Jamie Dimon, the bank's CEO.\n\nJPMorgan hired Javice as its managing director for student solutions because she was an \"incredible young woman,\" defense lawyer Jose Baez said during opening statements last month.\n\n\"They saw something in Charlie, a young female CEO breaking the glass ceiling,\" Baez, the Florida attorney who successfully defended Casey Anthony, told jurors. \"That's what JPMorgan negotiated for, and that's what they got.\"\n\nThe defense lawyers have also argued that Javice could not have intended to deceive JPMorgan because previous to the merger negotiations, she'd repeatedly said in interviews and on the pages of Frank that the website had helped 300,000 students and their families.\n\nAnd they've argued that when Javice cited that 4-million-user figure, JPMorgan executives misunderstood her.\n\n\"The 4.25 million figure was about website traffic based on Google Analytics metrics,\" her lawyer Kirsten Nelson said in a court filing earlier this month.\n\nApollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan testified on Thursday on behalf of Javice that terms like \"user,\" \"customer,\" and \"visitor\" were generally synonymous.\n\n\"A user could casually come and go and absorb Frank content without significant interaction,\" Rowan, an early Frank investor and board member, said of the millions who had clicked around the website.\n\nFinally, the defense may argue, as they have in court papers, that the bank concocted fraud allegations to fire Javice \"for cause\" and avoid paying her a $20 million retention bonus.\n\nThe defense may argue that JPMorgan killed Frank after an email-blast marketing campaign that failed not because of fraud but because JPMorgan Chase was tone-deaf to Gen Z.\n\nYoung people rarely answer emails, Javice witness Jennifer Zeitler, a former Frank marketing manager, told jurors on Thursday. The bank would have had better luck sending out texts instead, she told the jury on Thursday.\n\n\"Ninety-nine percent of text messages are read,\" she testified. Instead, \"We were just spamming people.\"",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Most Undervalued Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against other most undervalued dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStock prices took a steep hit in March as investors grew concerned about a possible economic downturn, driven by unpredictable tariff policies and signs of slowing job growth. The broader market has dropped over 7% from its peak on February 19, putting stocks on the doorstep of a correction.\n\nA group of seasoned investors saw last week\u2019s stock market downturn as a buying opportunity. As the market briefly entered correction territory, wiping out approximately $5 trillion from the broader market\u2019s value, corporate insiders began increasing their purchases. According to data from the Washington Service, the insider sentiment index climbed to 0.46 in March, up from 0.31 in January, with almost two weeks still remaining in the month. This puts the metric on track for its highest monthly level since June, bringing it closer to its historical norm.\n\nDave Mazza, chief executive officer of Roundhill Investments, made the following comment about the situation:\n\n\u201cIf we see corporate insiders begin to use the opportunity in their stock prices to purchase shares, that shows that they have confidence in the underlying economy and in their underlying businesses. That differs from just the headlines, because the headlines are scary.\u201d\n\nIn its 2025 US Market Outlook, Morningstar indicated that the US stock market was approaching the upper limit of its fair value range, suggesting that investors should moderate their return expectations for the year. It was noted that, since the end of 2010, the market had traded at such a premium or higher less than 10% of the time. Given these conditions, the firm had adopted a more cautious stance, emphasizing the increasing importance of portfolio positioning.\n\nMorningstar advised investors to overweight value stocks and underweight growth stocks, citing that growth stocks were trading at their highest premium relative to fair value since the tech-driven bubble in early 2021, whereas value stocks remained undervalued. As of March 3, 2025, the Morningstar Value Index had gained 5.54% year to date, while the Morningstar Growth Index had declined 3.81%.\n\nIn addition, investors are shifting capital into value funds, which are perceived as more resilient during market downturns compared to growth stocks. Data from Lipper shows that U.S. growth exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $3.6 billion in outflows this month, while U.S. value ETFs attracted $1.8 billion in inflows. Value funds, which are largely composed of stocks from sectors like banking, energy, and utilities, provide a cushion against market volatility by focusing on stable, cash-rich, and undervalued companies that tend to be less sensitive to economic swings.\n\nChris Marangi, co-chief investment officer of value funds at Gabelli Funds, noted that value stocks present an appealing opportunity, especially among small and mid-cap companies. He highlighted that these firms tend to gain more from deregulation and tax cuts while being less impacted by challenges like tariffs. Given this, we will take a look at the most undervalued stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz screener and identified dividend companies with forward P/E ratios below 15, as of March 20. The low price-to-earnings ratio shows that they are traded below their intrinsic value. From the resultant dataset, we selected seven companies that have the highest number of hedge fund investors at the end of Q4 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 123\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of March 20: 13.00\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is an American banking and financial services company. It posted strong financial results in the fourth quarter of 2024, with net income soaring 50% to $14 billion and net revenue rising 10% to $43.7 billion. While net interest income declined 3% to $23.5 billion, noninterest revenue saw a significant 29% increase, reaching $20.3 billion. Operating expenses fell 7% to $22.8 billion, but after adjusting for the previous year\u2019s $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment, they actually grew by 5%, driven by higher compensation, brokerage fees, and technology investments. The bank also allocated $2.6 billion for credit losses, with net charge-offs climbing to $2.4 billion, primarily from its Card Services division.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has built up a substantial excess capital reserve, equivalent to around 10% of its market capitalization while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital deployment. Although stock buybacks have not been a top priority, the company still repurchased $6.36 billion worth of shares in Q3 2024. As economic conditions stabilize, it is expected to gradually reduce its cash reserves and increase capital returns to shareholders.\n\nAs a consistent dividend payer since 1972, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) remains a preferred choice of income investors In the most recent quarter, the company reaffirmed its commitment to shareholder returns by distributing $3.5 billion in dividends. On March 18, it announced a 12% hike in its quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share. As of March 20, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.34%.\n\nOverall, JPM ranks 1st on our list of most undervalued dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of JPM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than JPM but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Jamie Dimon, CEO, JPMorgan\n\nOn Wednesday, March 20, during the second day of the Adobe Summit, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the America's largest bank, took the stage to discuss tariffs, the economy, geopolitics, and his perspective on effective leadership. In a fireside chat with Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen , Dimon reportedly addressed an audience of 12,000 marketers, practitioners, and executives, admitting, \"I'm not used to speaking in front of 12,000 people.\"According to a report in Fortune, when asked about his development as a leader, Dimon outlined four key principles. First, he emphasized the importance of honest and direct assessment, stating, \"A lot of companies don't do that,\" which leads to complacency and a lack of transparency about performance. \"Don't try to use numbers to prove what you think,\" he advised. \"Try to use numbers to understand what you are doing.\"Second, Dimon stressed the need for an effective leadership team, warning against those who are disorganized and fail to fulfill their responsibilities. \"They may be great people, just don't let them run something because they'll be a disaster,\" he quipped.Humility was Dimon's third piece of advice. \"People know when you care about them,\" he said, emphasizing the importance of genuineness and treating everyone with respect, from the janitorial staff to the CEO.Dimon emphasized the importance of resilience in leadership, especially when navigating challenges. \u201cYou have to say \u2018absolutely not,\u2019 or \u2018absolutely, take the chance\u2014go for it,\u2019\u201d he said.As the head of a bank managing $4 trillion in assets and moving over $10 trillion daily worldwide with approximately 300,000 employees, Dimon also addressed innovation at scale. He reportedly credited technology as a driving force behind human progress, from agriculture to AI, and emphasized the importance of leadership discussions about technological innovation. Dimon cited Lori Beer, JPMorgan Chase's global chief information officer, who reports to him and the president, as an example of how he engages with his team on questions like, \"What are you doing? What are you building? How are you competing? How are you using new technology? How are you using Adobe?\"",

While past records don't necessarily translate into future results, the company's payout ratio of 24% also shows that JPMorgan Chase is able to comfortably pay dividends.\n\nOver the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to expand by 9.3%.

Since 2015, the dividend has gone from $1.60 total annually to $5.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 12% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that JPMorgan Chase has been growing its earnings per share at 14% a year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock\n\nIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.\n\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

In its latest annual filing it had only one mention of DEI, in contrast with six mentions in the previous years.Several major U.S. and some European companies have dropped or altered their DEI policies following President Donald Trump's executive order to curtail such programs in the U.S.Even before Trump took office, big corporations were under increasing pressure from conservative groups to cut back or tweak their DEI policies aimed at boosting racial and ethnic representation in the workplace.Last month, Citigroup said it will no longer require a diverse slate of candidates for job interviews and said it was changing the name of the \"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Talent Management\" team to \"Talent Management and Engagement.\"Similarly, Goldman Sachs canceled a four-year-old policy of exclusively taking public companies with at least two diverse board members. It also dropped an entire section dedicated to \"diversity and inclusion\" from its annual filing. (Reporting by Nupur Anand in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)",

He discussed his future at JPMorgan, stating he plans to remain CEO for a \u201cfew more years\u201d before transitioning to a chairman role.\n\nHe also expressed interest in joining a nonprofit board post-JPMorgan, according to attendees.\n\nDimon addressed the bank\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts, reaffirming its commitment to these initiatives.\n\nHowever, Jennifer Piepszak, JPMorgan\u2019s COO, announced a name change to DOI\u2014diversity, opportunity, and inclusion\u2014in a memo on Friday.

            "content": "In a development that is setting the financial world abuzz, rumors are circulating that global banking powerhouse JPMorgan is closely monitoring the rapid advancements of Dave Labs. The Web 3.0-driven financial ecosystem has been making waves with its gold-backed digital assets and next-generation DeFi solutions, drawing the attention of institutional giants seeking early exposure to the evolving blockchain economy.\n\nSources familiar with the matter suggest that key figures within JPMorgan have been studying Dave Labs\u2019 financial model, regulatory strategies, and long-term viability. With traditional banking institutions increasingly warming up to blockchain-based financial ecosystems, speculation is rife that JPMorgan is evaluating potential partnerships or even direct involvement in Dave Labs\u2019 ground breaking initiatives.\n\nWhy Dave Labs? A Perfect Match for JPMorgan\u2019s Web 3.0 Ambitions\n\nDave Labs has distinguished itself as a pioneer in decentralized finance, combining the security of gold-backed assets with the flexibility of modern digital finance. This unique approach has drawn widespread investor confidence, as it mitigates the volatility commonly associated with cryptocurrencies. With a solid foundation of financial backing and strategic growth, Dave Labs has positioned itself as one of the most stable yet innovative projects in the digital asset space.\n\nJPMorgan, on the other hand, has been exploring blockchain and crypto-based investments for years. The banking behemoth launched its own digital currency, JPM Coin, and has shown increasing interest in tokenized real-world assets. Given its established dominance in institutional finance, the rumored interest in Dave Labs seems like a natural progression as JPMorgan looks to solidify its foothold in the next era of digital finance.\n\nCould JPMorgan Employees Be Privately Investing in Dave Labs?\n\nAdding further intrigue to the speculation, reports indicate that high-ranking JPMorgan executives and employees may already be investing their personal funds into Dave Labs. While institutional investment decisions require extensive due diligence, individual investors at JPMorgan seem to be placing their bets on the project ahead of any official endorsement from the banking giant.\n\nOne anonymous source from within JPMorgan stated, \u201cSeveral senior figures in the firm are deeply intrigued by Dave Labs\u2019 approach to asset security and blockchain integration. While nothing is official, there\u2019s growing curiosity among our internal teams, and some may have already allocated personal investments.\u201d\n\nIf true, this indicates strong belief in the long-term value of Dave Labs, not just from an institutional perspective but also from individual finance professionals who understand the evolving landscape of fintech. This aligns with a broader trend of Wall Street executives privately investing in blockchain projects before their firms formally enter the space.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s History with Blockchain: A Prelude to a Potential Dave Labs Involvement?\n\nJPMorgan has never shied away from innovation in finance. Despite CEO Jamie Dimon\u2019s past skepticism of Bitcoin, the bank has aggressively pursued blockchain technology, developing JPM Coin, investing in Ethereum-based projects, and integrating blockchain into cross-border payments. Their research division has also released multiple papers on tokenized assets, hinting at a long-term strategy that aligns with Dave Labs\u2019 core offerings.\n\nFurthermore, JPMorgan has been actively seeking partnerships within the blockchain and DeFi space. It has previously collaborated with ConsenSys, led blockchain-based interbank payments, and even tested tokenized bonds. Given this history, Dave Labs fits right into the kind of projects that could attract JPMorgan\u2019s institutional backing.\n\nWhat Could This Mean for Dave Labs and the Broader Crypto Market?\n\nIf the speculation turns out to be accurate and JPMorgan does establish formal ties with Dave Labs, it could send ripples across both the traditional financial and crypto markets. An endorsement or partnership with JPMorgan would bring immense credibility to Dave Labs, potentially leading to wider institutional adoption and integration with mainstream financial services.\n\nAdditionally, such a move could accelerate Wall Street\u2019s embrace of blockchain-based finance, inspiring other banking institutions to follow suit. Given JPMorgan\u2019s massive influence, its potential collaboration with Dave Labs could mark a turning point for DeFi projects, shifting them from niche digital assets to mainstream financial instruments.\n\nFinal Thoughts: The Future of JPMorgan and Dave Labs\n\nThe developments highlight the growing convergence between traditional finance and the blockchain innovation. Whether through strategic investment, partnerships, or research collaboration, it\u2019s evident that major financial institutions can no longer ignore the rise of DeFi.\n\nFor now, all eyes are on both JPMorgan and Dave Labs. We may soon witness one of the biggest financial institutions making a bold move into the Web 3.0 economy\u2014an event that could redefine the future of finance as we know it.\n\n\n\nMedia contact details\n\nCompany: DAVE Labs\n\nContact: Ganesh Jadhav\n\nEmail: contact@davelabs.io\n\nWebsite: https://www.davelabs.io\n\nAddress: UAE",

Analyst Samik Chatterjee upgraded Super Micro shares to neutral from underweight and lifted his price target by $10 to $45. With that new target, Chatterjee forecasts that shares of Super Micro, known for its servers powered with Nvidia graphics processing chips, could gain about 15% on the back of a better supply ramp from Nvidia's Blackwell chips. \"The company has cycled past the uncertainty in relation to pending SEC filings and is on the cusp of benefitting from ramp in Blackwell based server shipments which are already seeing materially higher demand than prior generation, with additional benefit to revenue growth from higher ASPs,\" Chatterjee said in a Friday note to clients. Chatterjee raised his fiscal year 2026 revenue forecast by $5 billion to $39 billion, which implies about 65% year-over-year growth. Still, the analyst remains cautious, citing Super Micro's \"challenging track record in relation to terms of the audit and filing issues, which will likely be an overhang on the earnings multiple\" along with its new CFO transition and closure of the Department of Justice investigation into the company's accounting practices. He added that an increasingly competitive landscape could lead Super Micro to see gross margin moderation and limited earnings growth relative to revenue growth in fiscal year 2026. Expenses tied to internal controls and future potential capital raises could also be headwinds. \"We balance the upcoming strong revenue progression with potential concerns around margin trajectory,\" he said. SMCI 1Y mountain SMCI stock performance. Super Micro shares have been on a volatile run this year. The company in February had given optimistic commentary for its 2026 fiscal year and filed its delayed financials for the latest fiscal year to meet the Nasdaq's listing deadline, which boosted shares. The stock is up more than 28% year to date, but has plummeted roughly 30% over the past month amid the broader market sell-off and concerns about slower growth in the AI industry.",

Despite the positive revenue outlook, the analyst cautions that intensifying competition may lead to aggressive pricing and gross margin pressures, creating a challenging balance for Super Micro as it capitalizes on its market opportunities.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) shares are up 1.38% to $39.64 in pre-market trading on Friday, following a Thursday close at $39.10. This shift comes as JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee revised the company\u2019s rating to \u2018Neutral\u2019 from \u2018Underweight,\u2019 lifting the price target to $45 from $35. The upgrade reflects a pivotal moment for Super Micro, which has navigated past uncertainties tied to delayed SEC filings and now stands poised to capitalize on surging demand for Blackwell-based server shipments, a next-generation product line outpacing its predecessors in market interest.\n\nChatterjee\u2019s outlook hinges on a dual-edged perspective. On one hand, the analyst sees a robust revenue trajectory over the next 12 months, driven by positive developments in recent weeks, particularly an improved supply chain boost from Nvidia (NVDA). This partnership is proving instrumental as Super Micro gears up to meet heightened demand for advanced server solutions, a critical component in the expanding data center and AI infrastructure markets. The company\u2019s ability to align with Nvidia\u2019s supply ramp positions it favorably in a tech landscape increasingly reliant on high-performance computing.\n\nYet, this optimism is tempered by challenges on the horizon. JPMorgan\u2019s raised revenue forecasts are balanced against potential margin pressures, as the competitive environment intensifies. Chatterjee warns that aggressive pricing strategies, spurred by rivals vying for market share, could squeeze Super Micro\u2019s gross margins despite the promising revenue growth. This tension underscores a broader industry dynamic where innovation and scale must coexist with profitability, a tightrope Super Micro must walk as it leverages its Blackwell-based offerings. With shares reflecting early market approval at $39.64 and a new target of $45, the company\u2019s next moves will be closely watched as it balances opportunity and risk in this high-stakes sector.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

Analysts remain cautiously optimistic about Nike's long-term prospects, but acknowledge the road to recovery could be turbulent, with significant pressure expected on revenue and margins in the near term.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI, Financial) saw a positive shift as J.P. Morgan upgraded its stock, citing the resolution of financial filing uncertainties and strong demand for its AI server shipments. This upgrade reflects confidence in Super Micro's growth trajectory despite potential margin pressures in a competitive landscape.\n\nFedEx (FDX, Financial) shares took a hit after the company revised its fiscal year outlook downwards, citing ongoing weaknesses in the U.S. industrial economy. The company now anticipates flat to slightly declining revenue, with adjusted EPS projections also lowered, reflecting the challenging economic environment.\n\nAccenture (ACN, Financial) experienced stock pressure after CEO Julie Sweet highlighted potential revenue impacts from the Trump Administration's spending cuts.

Any payment on the ETNs is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d).\n\nThe ETNs seek to provide exposure to the daily returns of the S&P 500\u00ae VIX\u00ae Short-Term Futures Points-Change Inverse Daily Index TR (the \u201cIndex\u201d), subject to the daily investor fee deduction at a rate of 0.85% per annum. The ETNs will also be redeemable at the sole discretion of JPMorgan Financial on any trading day after March 21, 2025 until maturity.\n\nThe Index is designed such that its level on a given day will increase or decrease by 1% from its closing level on the prior day if the weighted average price of the front- and the second-month VIX\u00ae futures contracts decreases or increases, as applicable, by one point on that day. The Index implements this by tracking the daily \u201cpoints-change\u201d return from a rolling synthetic short position in the front- and the second-month VIX\u00ae futures contracts, which are futures contracts based on the Cboe Volatility Index\u00ae. The Cboe Volatility Index\u00ae is a benchmark index designed to measure the market price of volatility in large-capitalization U.S. stocks over 30 days in the future and calculated based on the real-time prices of certain put and call options on the S&P 500\u00ae Index. As a \u201ctotal return\u201d index, the return of the Index also reflects interest accrued at a rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d).\n\nThe Index has been developed by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, as index sponsor, and is maintained and calculated by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, as index calculation agent. The Index is reported on a real-time basis under Bloomberg ticker symbol \u201cSPVXSTIT.\u201d\n\nSelected Risk Considerations\n\nThe ETNs may not be suitable for all investors and should be purchased only by investors with sophistication and knowledge necessary to understand the risks and potential consequences of investing in the ETNs, including the risks inherent in the Index, the underlying VIX\u00ae futures contracts and short investments in volatility as an asset class generally. Investors should actively manage and monitor their investments in the ETNs.\n\nThe ETNs are subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Financial, as issuer of the ETNs, and the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase, as guarantor of the ETNs. Investing in the ETNs is not equivalent to taking a long position directly in the Index or taking a short position directly in the VIX\u00ae futures contracts underlying the Index or the Cboe Volatility Index\u00ae.

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- With worries over US trade policy roiling Wall Street, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is repackaging a well-known strategy that would profit if the turbulence subsided.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Inverse VIX Short-Term Futures ETNs, ticker VYLD, provides exposure to an index shorting futures tied to Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, known as the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX.\n\nThese kinds of products have had a spotty history on Wall Street, following several high-profile blowups that came when calm markets suddenly went haywire. Their mechanics can be difficult for even sophisticated investors to understand and market participants have pointed out past design flaws that ramped up risk, though strategies have evolved in recent years to offer protective buffers.\n\nThe JPMorgan investment-bank strategy is designed to gain 1% for every point that VIX futures fall, before accounting for fees and returns on cash. It works by scaling up exposure to futures when markets grow turbulent, allowing investors to benefit if volatility subsequently falls.\n\n\u201cThis is a unique situation,\u201d said Todd Sohn, senior ETF strategist at Strategas. \u201cShorting volatility \u2014 through a structure that really doesn\u2019t see much attention anymore: an ETN.\u201d\n\nConcerns over how White House tariff policies will impact US growth and inflation have dragged the S&P 500 nearly 8% from its record high and sent the VIX hovering above its 10-year average for the last four weeks. Still, investors looking to use products such as VYLD to bet that things will get less turbulent from here will have to face some unnerving history.\n\nIn a 2018 event dubbed \u201cVolmageddon,\u201d the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN imploded after dropping more than 90% in a single session, while the VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (TVIX) was delisted during the pandemic. In 2022, Barclays Plc spurred wild price moves after it committed a blunder on two popular exchange-traded notes. A global market selloff sparked by an unwind of the Japanese yen carry trade caused a rapid spike in the VIX last year, though the index quickly reversed that move.\n\nNevertheless, JPMorgan has seen \u201cincreased interest from the market for volatility products over the last few years,\u201d it said in emailed comments.",

He's maintained his leadership position for nearly 20 years, since January 2006.\n\nSo how has he navigated the role for almost two decades? In a fireside chat with Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen at the Adobe Summit on Wednesday, Dimon told an audience of 12,000 executives, marketers, and professionals how he does it. In particular, Dimon highlighted four principles that have helped develop him as a leader.\n\nFirst, he said, though \"a lot of companies\" don't follow this rule, he recommends assessing everything \"honestly, directly, forthrightly\" about performance. Dimon told leaders that, when giving feedback, they should avoid starting with a pre-formed narrative about where the company is going and how well it is doing, and then fitting performance numbers, like revenue and yearly growth, into that narrative.\n\nRelated: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Says Only One Group Is Complaining About Returning to the Office\n\nInstead, he told them to begin with the numbers and honestly assess where the company is headed without a prior bias.\n\n\"Don't try to use numbers to prove what you think,\" Dimon said. \"Try to use numbers to understand what you are doing.\"\n\nDimon recently called his company's corporate workforce back to the office five days per week after assessing performance in meetings and career development.\n\nDimon then told his fellow CEOs to assemble their leadership teams carefully. While some employees might be good people, there's a chance that they may not understand the demands of leadership.\n\nLeaders who are always late and not doing their jobs weigh the whole company down, Dimon cautioned.\n\n\"A lot of people who run stuff, they're a hot mess,\" Dimon said. \"Don't let them run something because they'll be a disaster.\"\n\nRelated: 'Elon and I Hugged It Out': JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Says He Reconciled With Elon Musk After Lawsuits\n\nDimon's third and fourth leadership tips noted inner traits. He specifically advised executives to have humility and grit. Humility means showing employees that you genuinely care about them and treat them with respect, \"whether it's the person cleaning the bathrooms in the office or a CEO,\" Dimon said. Grit, meanwhile, is about quickly making decisions, sticking to them, and managing whatever arises throughout the day.\n\n\"You have to say 'absolutely not,' or 'absolutely, take the chance\u2014go for it,'\" Dimon said.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nHow JPMorgan Is Using AI\n\nDimon told the crowd that JPMorgan found at least 700 use cases for AI, including advertisements and marketing. The bank has more than 2,000 AI specialists working on everything from data science problems to natural language processing.\n\nFor example, one AI agent inside the company can go through billions of pages of internal documents to answer questions about the bank's inner workings.\n\nDimon said \"hundreds\" of employees, including JPMorgan branch staff, use the AI tool.\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Isn't Worried About AI Taking Over Jobs \u2014 Here's Why",

Kevork Djansezian/Reuters\n\nThe Apollo CEO wore a black suit and white dress shirt \u2014 no tie \u2014 and sipped from a plastic water bottle as he spoke. He and Javice exchanged two-handed waves and broad smiles as he left the courtroom for Thursday's lunch break.\n\nHe told jurors he remained at arm's length from JPMorgan's $175 million acquisition of Frank, the 2021 merger at the center of the fraud trial.\n\nProsecutors say Javice and codefendant Olivier Amar used phony data to trick the bank into thinking the website had compiled the names, addresses, and other personal information for 4.25 million high school and college students \u2014 a valuable new market for the bank's checking accounts and credit cards.\n\nDespite his distance from the merger, Rowan's testimony had a twofold use for the defense.\n\nJurors heard an influential CEO praise Javice as a young entrepreneur with the savvy to win a one-on-one meeting with Jamie Dimon. As CEO of JPMorgan, Dimon ran the country's largest bank.\n\n\"She reported a very enthusiastic meeting with the CEO,\" Rowan said, remembering the 2021 conversation with a smile.\n\nRowan's testimony \u2014 under questioning by defense lawyer Christopher Tayback of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan \u2014 also had a tactical usefulness.\n\nJavice's lawyers have argued that when she told JPMorgan that Frank had 4.25 million \"users,\" she was actually only counting website visitors, a number supported by Google analytics metrics.\n\n\"A user could casually come and go and absorb Frank content without significant interaction,\" Rowan told the jury, saying there was little difference between words such as \"user,\" \"customer,\" and \"visitor.\"\n\nThen came Rowan's cross-examination.\n\n\"You said on direct that you understood 'user,' 'customer,' 'visitor,' and 'website user' to be synonymous?\" Assistant US Attorney Nicholas Chiuchiolo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Rowan answered. \"I'm pretty used to those terms being used interchangeably.\"\n\n\"Do you know how a 'Frank user' was described to Capital One?\" the prosecutor then asked, referring to another potential Frank purchaser.\n\n\"No,\" Rowan answered.\n\n\"Do you know how a 'Frank user' was described to JPMorgan Chase?\" the prosecutor asked, to which Rowan again answered, \"No.\"\n\nAs the cross-examination continued, Rowan said he did not know how many user names, phone numbers, and email addresses Frank actually possessed when the merger went through.\n\nHe also said he was unaware that Frank told JPMorgan that the website had what Chiuchiolo termed \"4.264 unique customer accounts.\"\n\n\"You said that as a board member of a small company, you were a sounding board for Ms. Javice,\" the prosecutor said. \"Did you ever advise Ms. Javice to send JPMorgan a fake customer list made up of false data?\" he asked, repeating an allegation from the indictment.\n\n\"No,\" Rowan answered.\n\n\"Did you ever advise Ms. Javice to purchase a customer list on the open market and tell JPMorgan that they were Frank customers?\" the prosecutor then asked, as a final question.\n\n\"No, I did not,\" Rowan answered.\n\nThe trial is off on Friday. Defense testimony for Javice, and then for Amar, is expected to continue next week, with closing arguments tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nMarch 20, 2025: This story has been updated to add details of additional testimony from Thursday afternoon.",

As a PBM, Caremark sets the drug prices for JPMorgan Chase's employee health plans.\n\nJPMorgan Chase employs roughly 20,000 people in central Ohio. The lawsuit is being brought by both current and former employees across the country.\n\nMore on JPMorgan Chase: JPMorgan Chase CEO Dimon derides pushback to return to office, demands efficiency\n\nThe consequence, according to the lawsuit, is JPMorgan Chase itself and employees and their families paying an average of over 200 times the cost for hundreds of generic prescription drugs available at drastically cheaper prices, even for the uninsured.\n\nOne example includes the plan\u2019s purchase of the multiple sclerosis drug teriflunomide, which was allegedly bought at a price of $6,229. At retail pharmacies, the drug can be purchased for around $30 without insurance. A drug price like this paid by a health plan can result in higher out-of-pocket costs and higher premiums for participants, while much of the money is pocketed by a PBM.\n\nOther PBM news: Columbus joins national fight accusing drug manufacturers of inflating insulin prices\n\nBank abandoned \"fiduciary responsibility,\" plaintiffs say\n\nThe lawsuit further alleges that any lack of oversight by the company is \"willful\" and violates the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).\n\nERISA is a federal law that aims to protect the interests of participants in a health plan, by setting industry standards and the fiduciary responsibilities of employers and others who control health plans. The lawsuit accuses JPMorgan Chase of abandoning that \"fiduciary responsibility\" by agreeing to inflated drug prices to the detriment of their employees, even though less expensive options and health plan models were available.\n\n\"No prudent fiduciary would agree or allow for its plan and participants/beneficiaries pay a price that is more than two hundred times higher than the price available to any individual who just walks into a pharmacy and pays out-of-pocket, and five hundred sixty times higher than the price available with just a few clicks online,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nJPMorgan Chase declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nSamantha Hendrickson is The Dispatch's medical business and health care reporter.

JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. et al., filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, plaintiff Alexandro Gonzalez claimed that JPMorgan Chase Bank failed to objectively and adequately review the plan\u2019s investment offerings, initially and on an ongoing basis, with due care to ensure each investment option was prudent in terms of performance.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, the plan had more than $44 billion in assets under management and 295,407 participants. Gonzalez\u2019s complaint argues that, as a jumbo plan, the plan had substantial bargaining power regarding the fees and expenses charged against participants\u2019 investments.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, fiduciaries at JPMorgan allowed substantial assets in the 401(k) plan to be invested in the JPMorgan Stable Value Fund that invested in synthetic guaranteed investment contracts offered by MetLife, Prudential Financial, Transamerica and Voya Financial.\n\nGICs are issued by insurance companies in the form of a fixed annuity contract.\n\n\u201cA prudent fiduciary would not have included this underperforming investment option that also carried significantly more risk than other investment options that had similar goals, i.e., preservation of investment assets,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nThe complaint also states that a more prudent fiduciary could have demanded higher crediting rates from the insurance companies by submitting requests for proposals to the insurance companies and other providers of stable value investments.\n\nIn addition, the plaintiff alleges that the insurance companies \u201cbenefited significantly\u201d from participants in the plan investing in the stable value fund. The complaint states that the crediting rates the insurance companies provided to the plan \u201cwere and are so low that the insurance companies reaped a windfall on the spread.\u201d\n\nThe complaint also accuses JPMorgan of failing to monitor its investment committee to ensure that it was adequately performing its fiduciary obligations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.\n\nThe plaintiff is asking the court to declare that JPMorgan breached its fiduciary duties under ERISA and order the company both to disgorge all profits received from the plan and to make good on all plan losses resulting from \u201cimprudent investment of the plan\u2019s assets,\u201d among other demands.\n\nGonzalez is represented by law firm Capozzi Adler P.C. in the case.\n\nJPMorgan declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThe bank was also sued last week by current and former health plan participants who allege the company mismanaged the prescription drug benefit under its health insurance offering.",

            "content": "Thank you for joining us. Prior to making financial or investment decisions, you should speak with a qualified professional in your JP Morgan team. This concludes today's webcast. You may now disconnect.\n\nAnd, it's going to require us to do some deciphering of how this administration is going to deal with, its ability to have Medicaid and Medicare CMS re negotiate the price of, of non generic drugs. So anyway, that's our next project. Thank you all very much for dialing in. I hope there was something that was triggering and offensive to just about everybody.\n\nAnd as you can see in this very messy chart, this looks at, consensus forward return on equity on the x axis relative to price to book ratios on the y axis. Bottom line is that most of these things tend to move together. Valuations tend to go up as you make more money. but the cheapest sectors on this chart are health care providers, the overall health care sector, large cap pharma and biotech.\n\nI do believe there's more substance to that than the last round of stuff we had with hydrogen and the metaverse and things like that. I do think that there are some real productivity and earnings benefits to come from AI adoption. and that that could partially offset some of the costs related to a higher tariff world. the next project that we're all going to work on, on my team is health care.\n\nIf you believe the MSCI weights, if you're 85% plus, I would consider some rebalancing at this point because I think that the administration, oddly enough, with its American America First agenda that may not translate into American first outperformance in the equity markets. And then one last comment. you know, I we've written a lot about how the hyperscalers may have overspent in the near term relative to demand for compute infrastructure, but the productivity benefits for the corporate sector from AI adoption should gradually start to show up in earnings.\n\nI'd also like to see high yield spread credit spreads go above 400 basis points. Those are the kind of things that would make me personally feel more comfortable advising investors to take some of their spare liquidity and put it to work. And the other thing is, as I have been a stronger advocate for a US centric portfolio than almost anybody in the on the buy side in the industry, but the US is 60, around 63% of a global diversified equity portfolio.\n\nIt happened at 60% of all years. And a 15% correction happened 40% of the time. And in years with those 10 to 20% corrections, full stock market returns have still averaged 15%. So the fact that a correction is taking place doesn't necessarily tell you that the full year returns are problematic, or there's more bad news to come. I personally think a 15% decline from the peak levels, which is about 5200 on the S&P, would be a clearer sign of capitulation.\n\nI do think there's another shoe to drop with the imposition of some kind of reciprocal tariff. A big issue was whether or not the administration includes that taxes in Europe as part of that reciprocity. And but just to be clear, corrections like we've had are not uncommon over the last hundred years. A 10% correction like the one we've had happened more than half the time.\n\nSo what do we have here? I think we have a growth slowdown. JP morgan's investment banking economists have already started to publish on that. I think we get a growth slowdown but no recession. the economic consequences of some of this chaos are hard to predict. Remember, the tariff rates are now going back to before all or most of us on this call were born.\n\nSo wrapping up. I think we titled this presentation chaos versus Grand Design. I think chaos is part of the grand design. There's a deliberate amount of chaos in this grand design that investors are going to have to get used to, and which credit spreads and p multiples and valuations of real estate and cross-border capital flows will eventually start to reflect as well.\n\nThey would want to have no income tax on tips. So manufacturing incentives mean maybe no taxes on overtime, an increase in homeland security. But most of this is just deck shuffling with a modest increase in the deficit compared to the CBO baseline.\n\nAnd this is one iteration, right? The bill hasn't passed, but this is one iteration that we've written about recently. And what's going on in this chart is, they're they would aim to cut, about 800 billion for Medicaid, get rid of the Biden student loan forgiveness, and increase the, at the same time that they would increase the salt cap, they would claw back about 500 billion from Biden's energy bill, mostly EV charging other EV projects and a little bit of a clawback on the wind and solar, ITC, PTC incentives.\n\nAnd as it relates to the stimulus bill, this is a brutally complicated chart. So I'm not going to walk through it. I'm simply going to say that even if they can get this reconciliation bill passed, extending tax cuts is not stimulus. And that's all they're really trying to do, is pass a reconciliation bill, which will extend the personal and corporate tax cuts that were embedded in the 2017 bill and everything else outside of that is reshuffling the deck there.\n\nI'm going to watch this chart, on on, pipeline growth and transmission line growth and we'll see what happens. That's a kind of a long dated benefit. But these are the kind of things the administration says they're going to focus on, which would be growth enhancing if they could get them done.\n\nNow, this will be interesting. If they can do this, I would really kind of tip my hat to the administration over the last few years, it's gotten close to impossible to build transmission for renewable projects or pipelines for oil and gas projects. And the Trump administration says they're focused on permitting reform. If they can get that done, that would be impressive.\n\nbut they weren't as restrictive in terms of actual oil and gas production as people sometimes think, which is why Besson's target is only a 5 to 7% increase. in overall fossil fuel production compared to current levels. And since some of that is going to end up exported, through LNG relationships, I don't see how much benefit that's going to have in terms of reducing, energy costs.\n\nAlthough if you if you look at, crude oil, natural gas and NGL production, it went to an all time high under the Biden administration. The Biden administration was not about sticks against the oil and gas industry. They were focused on incentives for the renewable industry to the tune of anywhere from 1 to 2 trillion, depending upon how you compute them.\n\nSo, if they continue to rearm as much as they may try to spend a lot of that money domestically, they I think, would be required to spend some of that money with U.S. defense contractors simply because they don't always have all the products and services and procurement equipment that would be needed. I think a lot of people are familiar with the administration's view on oil and gas production.\n\nThere is a lot of discussion now about European rearmament, which is being imposed on them essentially by the United States, that if it happens, that would be an indirect benefit to U.S. defense contractors, at least so far as we can tell. If you look at European weapons spending, since 2022, more than half of it went to U.S. defense contractors.\n\nthat would be helpful. In other words, more examples of the of the deal that was struck with TSMC to start investing in US semiconductor production. you can see in Trump's first term, there was a surge in the inward share of global foreign direct investment in the United States. And then again during the period of the post-Covid focus on domestic resiliency.\n\nAnd in advance of Basel three being implemented, a lot of banks began to accumulate the necessary capital to do that. If Basel three is now dead, presumably that capital would flow back out into the economy and terms and conditions on credit would loosen, which could help growth. I think they'll be. I think Trump will continue to negotiate deals with other countries where to avoid tariffs if they make sufficient foreign direct investments in the US.\n\nSo, something to keep an eye on. Basel the Basel three project will probably be abandoned. certainly. I don't think this administration has mentioned anything they want to do to support it that could boost the credit supply as banks reduce accumulated capital. So if I can just explain for a minute the Basel three proposal would have required the big banks, the category 1 or 2 banks to increase, their capital by about $2 trillion.\n\nSo if the IRS shrinks by 50%, which is a workforce decrease of about 50,000 people, Yale Budget Lab estimates that this could result in a $400 billion forgone revenue, over the next ten year budget window. And if the lack of IRS resources leads to a substantial increase in noncompliance, which is tax evasion, the numbers could be much higher than that.\n\nAnd I, I fully expect that to be the case here as well. Why wouldn't it be? They're dismantling a lot of the entities that that do regulating in the first place. I on this one, I do want to mention there was a study that came out from Yale's budget lab yesterday, about how the Trump administration might want to cut, headcount at the IRS.\n\nAnd the impacts are long dated. the pace of government regulation obviously should slow. This is a chart on economically significant rules by presidency. Trump was on a low GOP like path until Covid hit. And then in the beginning of 2020, obviously, all of a sudden there were all sorts of Covid related regulations that took place. But Trump during his first administration, was on track to be a low regulation president.\n\nSo let me close with what are so what are the pro-growth productivity policies of the administration that everyone thought were going to be rolled out contemporaneously with the tariffs? that would eventually kind of make investors and profits and multiples, react positively. So let's talk through those. One of them is the pace of government regulation. And that takes time.\n\nBut, I don't know. I would rather take my chances outside the US. in, in, in places like Japan, where there are some interesting corporate governance changes going on than, than in Europe. But that said, there the US, this chart is on the PE discount of Europe versus the US and Europe, even after it's outperformed this year, is still trading at a 35% PE discount to the US, which is kind of remarkable.\n\nand the Europe's been outperforming the US so far this year, but not by more than it has in recent years, where kind of every once in a while Europe will outperform the US by 10% or so and then roll over again. Now what's happening here this time around is a little more interesting. You're seeing a move towards more European stimulus and things like that.\n\nAnd, and I wouldn't describe the, the increase in high yield spreads as, as particularly problematic right now, they have risen to just 300 basis points for double B in single B spreads, which I don't think is is anywhere near fair value. But as a as a response to what's going on, this is a rather tepid response. And one of the reasons is that default rates in high yield and leveraged loans and private credit are still running at very low rates of around 2%.\n\nin a strong environment. I no longer think that's the case. We're going to we're going to have rates of four and a half to 5%. And the only reason that rates go below four is if you have a growth collapse. so that kind of benign decline in rates I think is off the table right now. And, high yield spreads are starting to rise, but from very low levels.\n\nThis was a barometer, in my opinion, that, the markets were expecting inflationary policies out of the administration. and I still think that's the case. We still have a ten year that's around 1% higher than it was, since the Fed's first cut. we may end up with lower rates on the ten year, but in the beginning of the year, the market perception was that you could get a growth and productivity surge that would allow rates to go down.\n\nThis chart is important to understand it. There's only been about seven cycles in which the fed has eased like over the last 30 years. And almost every time the fed eases, you start the clock and then the ten year either stays flat or goes down. This time the ten year started to rise and it started rising. Around the time that it became clear that Trump was likely to win the election.\n\nThis is kind of a global schadenfreude, a reaction to what Musk has been up to. and so, and then down 11% in the US. So, that's been an issue for, for Tesla as well. The a lot of the questions we get obviously is about what's happening with policy rates and then what's happening with ten year interest rates.\n\nthe JP Morgan investment Bank is forecasting another 50% decline in the stock to just $120 a share. That was a report that they issued last week. And then I've shown here on the page there are some ferocious sales declines outside the United States for Tesla. looking at January, February sales down 70% in Australia, 70 something percent in Germany, 50% in China, 40 to 50% in Scandinavia, 25% in France.\n\nBut Trump's Department of Justice filed a brief arguing that Google should be forced to divest of of Chrome. and also no longer be able to make their default search engine payments to Apple and things like that. That may be negatively affecting sentiment, but one of the biggest issues facing the Mag seven stocks is what's happening with Tesla.\n\nBecause if you look at that gold line the Mag seven PE ratios have gone way down. So for people deploying money at least since 2018 this is one of the lowest valuation environments. If you believe the forward earnings projections and then the S&P ex the Mag seven you know has has corrected modestly compared to where we've been. some I think there's more to come here obviously.\n\nthe S&P corrected by around 10% recovered, 2 or 3%. The US has been underperforming, the rest of the global equity markets. And then there's been a much bigger correction in, in the mag seven stocks. And just to touch on that a little bit, here is a valuation chart. And so this for for investors this is actually interesting right.\n\nSo and that number is rolled over. And then, as you can see on the right, the small business, the NFB Small Business Survey, perception of capital, future capital spending plans surged after the election. But then that optimism has cratered again to one of the lowest levels on record. And then what's been happening in the actual equity markets? Well, we've had a relief rally since last Friday.\n\nAnd it's the new orders less inventories component to the ESM. And so for people that follow this kind of stuff, it makes sense. What are companies doing in terms of their order books for the the orders that they're getting for new equipment and the orders they're putting in for purchasing new equipment, less the inventory accumulation that they're doing.\n\nAnd that number has imploded, to one of the worst observed nations on record since 1990. So, people are the consumers. Households are expecting a real implosion in the job market. so we'll see. So far, the job markets are pretty stable. My favorite leading indicator, and it's my favorite because it's the one that has the closest relationship with what equity markets do next, was rising recently and then just rolled over.\n\nHow are consumers responding? I tend to not get too carried away with this kind of stuff, because they tend not to be great leading indicators of what happens to, equity markets and credit markets. But I did want to show you that consumer sentiment is rolled over. And then on the right one of the questions in the University of Michigan Sentiment survey is, what do you expect to happen in the unemployment rate over the next year?\n\nBut these stage three goods are plastic bottles, rubber hoses, tires, concrete, structural steel, motor vehicle parts wiring devices. So you can see that these stage three input costs are beginning to go up again.\n\nBut now some of the medium term inflation expectations are rising too. And some important actual measures of inflation are starting to tick up. This one looks at the producer price report and digs in, and looks at what's called stage three producers who buy intermediate inputs that are affected by tariffs. And maybe some of this is just people buying in advance of tariff imposition.\n\nIf you're if you're in charge of monetary policy on the left, you can see surveys of prices paid in both the manufacturing and services sector. Again, to be clear, nowhere near the surge that took place, during the Biden inflation period of 2021 2022. But those numbers starting to rise again. And then on the right, some of the University of Michigan and New York fed surveys of of medium term and long term inflation expectations, the short term ones are rising.\n\nWhat's changing is a rapid shift in some of the leading indicators, some of which are surveys and could reverse. But I just want to show you what they are. I think the first and the first leading indicator we need to talk about is inflation expectations, because this is what puts the fed in a box, which is if growth weakens at the same time that inflation expectations are going up, that's difficult.\n\nWell, first, it's really important to point out that A, that this is my preferred high frequency indicator of the economy. it comes from the Dallas Fed and it's got retail sales, fuel sales, electricity output, unemployment claims. And it's very stable. As if anything, it's actually kind of ticking up. So contemporaneous real time measures of U.S growth still look good.\n\nSo that's what matters for investors. All right. Now, for the remainder of the presentation, I want to talk about how the markets are. By the way, nobody wanted to do this, present this webcast with me. And now I think you can see why, we're going to review how the economy's responding, how the markets are responding, and what are some of the pro-growth, productivity enhancing policies that the administration may pursue that are still to come that will offset some of the negative stuff they've been doing so far?\n\nThe most important number to look at here is the second bar. The US represents around a quarter of world trade. the US represents a much higher share of cross-border loans, international debt securities, FX transactions, foreign exchange, reserve investments by other central banks, trade invoicing, Swift payments, you name it. The United States. It has a as a primacy role in global commerce because if it's adherence to rule of law, and if that's if the perception of that starts to change, there can be an impact on all of these things multiples, portfolio flows, foreign direct investment, and a lot of things that the administration says that they care about.\n\nI this is not this is not a serious way of dealing with the Justice Department, in my opinion. And the reason this matters for investors, you might be saying, why does any of this matter for investors? Here's why. The rule of law is an integral part of the global primacy of U.S. commerce. And this charts one of the most important charts that I'm always showing investors who are panicked about the dollar as the world's reserve currency.\n\nAnd what I've listed here is a bunch of the components within those executive orders. So far, five of them have been challenged, and a judge has granted a temporary restraining order. but when you read some of the things in these executive orders, limiting access of these law firms, personnel to enter government buildings or speak to government employees, or investigating third party contractors to see if they have business with some of these law firms unrelated to their government work.\n\nAnd so the US pharma trade deficit didn't start skyrocketing out of control until the 2017 tax bill, solving it by just putting tariffs on the entire pharmaceutical industry is not a serious way of trying to fix this problem. And then, you know, over the last 72 hours, we've had this executive order with respect to law firms whose partners participated in Trump prosecutions or investigations Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss Covington and Burling.\n\nAnd so this is one of the things where people say, that's why we need tariffs. Because U.S. companies are gaming the system. Are US pharma companies gaming the system by shifting profits offshore? Yes. But when did they start doing that? As you can see on the right, they started doing it after Trump's own tax bill was passed based on a low, highly favorable tax, on international intangible income.\n\nAnd so if there's a measles outbreak and I get sick, I know exactly who to blame. So, here's another one. A lot of people are upset about the chart on the left, and I understand why these are the seven largest pharma companies. And, what you can see is the US taxes they paid versus the foreign taxes they paid.\n\nSo, you know, I am, I'm one of those people. That was I was born in 1962. So I'm one of those people where the MMR vaccine may have fading efficacy, but I have a certain condition where I can't take live vaccines. So I'm actually at risk of having a fading efficacy of my initial MMR vaccine. But I'm unable to get a new one.\n\nAnd this is a perfect example, because vitamin A supplements can reduce the mortality risk of measles, but mostly in Low Countries where a lot of people have vitamin deficiencies in the first place. In the US, only 0.3% of all people are vitamin deficient, which is why studies have OECD countries show no benefit for vitamin A in measles outbreaks.\n\nAnd then as it relates to RFK Jr, a lot of you know how I feel about that, he said. Studies have found that vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles, measles mortality. Here's the thing about RFK that where I question if he's a serious person, most of his factoids have kernels of truth in them, which then aren't applicable to the thing that's being discussed.\n\nBut the immediate response of cutting grants and funding, seems like an extreme and preliminary, you know, an overly cautious reaction to that. The NIH has already stopped issuing new awards and has begun withholding funds from grants that had already been awarded. And just as a reminder, the NIH has supported 99% of all the drugs approved by the FDA from 2020 to 2019, and nearly all major medical breakthroughs over the last few decades, including treatments for chronic pain, autoimmune diseases, GLP weight loss drugs, melanoma treatments, RNA vaccines, cervical cancer, you name it.\n\nSo I'm not sure serious people would be doing these things. And then on science and medical leadership, some of the decisions to cut funding to the NIH, could have effects US science primacy for generations. When I first saw that indirect costs were, on average, 60% of direct costs. I asked the same questions the Trump administration did. Gee, those indirect costs seem kind of high.\n\nThere was a directive to Columbia University to put the Middle East and African Studies Department into receivership. And then recently, some European tourists, the United States, were detained by Ice, held for several weeks and then deported. I'm not sure that's great for, you know, tourism into the United States. and the Trump administration is also talking about, I read this morning all trading, altering the computation of GDP, in ways that it considers more favorable.\n\nRight? Not a serious thing. then is a strategic crypto reserve. Is that really what the country needs right now, given all the challenges that it's facing? Or is that simply or reward to the sector that contribute to the most of of across all the sectors to the president's reelection campaign? Citibank recently was instructed to freeze accounts for habitat for humanity, United Way and the New York Department of Taxation and Finance because they were recipients of green energy grants from the EPA, and they're now being investigated for possible fraud.\n\nI'm not sure that a serious person would do that. The Doge website reports of its savings are riddled with errors and constantly changing, and now the website is taking steps to make some of its errors harder to find. And just as an example, Doge fired and then rehired 350 people at the National Nuclear Security Administration, including people who assemble and reassemble nuclear warheads.\n\nBut, what's come out of Dodge recently? Massive amounts of misinformation on this whole Social Security payment. The dead people issue. We had a link in the prior I in the market to a, the Boston College Center for Retirement Research debunked all of those issues. there have been calls from Doge people to impeach judges when those actions were judicially reversed.\n\nAnd when we used to get those things, which is China and the Middle East, and so the notion that somehow bilateral energy deficits with Canada represents subsidies, it makes no sense economically, it makes no sense politically. And it doesn't even make any sense geologically. And so I'm not sure that serious people would say this, un doge. I mean, again, everybody I think that I've talked to understands the need for eliminating fraud, waste and cutting certain government programs.\n\nAnd despite it being one of the largest trading partners with the US, the implication being that the terms of trade on a bilateral basis are fair and the US actually runs a trade surplus with Canada. Once you remove energy and look, the issue with energy is produce more of it as you can. But Canada sells us oil and critical minerals and zinc and solarium and nickel and vanadium, and energy and critical minerals purchased from Canada by the US is a deliberate strategy by the US to reduce reliance.\n\nThis can't continue. The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished 51st state. Okay, after I read that long tweet on Truth Social, I picked myself up off the floor. And then I started to look at the actual numbers and, Canada actually represents, as you can see on the left, one of the smallest components of the US trade deficit.\n\nChip companies are reportedly already calling their lawyers to assess whether the administration can terminate signed contracts. And the Commerce Department has laid off around a third of the chief office employees. So if this is the direction this is going, I'm not sure serious people would do this. Next issue and this is on the issue of Canada, where Trump has said we're subsidizing Canada to the tune of $200 billion a year.\n\nThe chart on the right is the number in thousands of semiconductor Chinese semiconductors in U.S. critical military platforms. So when you look at the backdrop here, there may be things you want to change about the Chip act, but to simply come out and say it was a horrible, horrible thing flies in the face of this critical national security issue.\n\nThe US is 90% reliant on on Taiwan. And so the Chips bill, which was a bipartisan effort or at least partially bipartisan, was the first step in decades to try to repatriate some, semiconductor production back in US soil. And it's in Arizona, and it's taking a while to build. And labor costs are high, but you've got to start someplace.\n\nOkay. Is that a serious statement? The US, as you can see, there's a chart here on the left that looks at US semiconductor reliance on Taiwan. You can cut it different ways. You can look at all chips. You could look at memory chips. You can look at logic chips. The last part looks at advanced logic chips including indirect flows.\n\nBut the second question is the one that's really important for investors, because it has to do with valuations and multiples and predictability. And the question is are these serious people? And I'm not sure that the answer is yes. And I want to show you why in about five slides. So are these serious people. Trump has said the Chips act is a horrible, horrible thing.\n\nThese people are very serious. they've done their homework. They clearly understand the Administrative Procedures Act. The the approaches that they've take to do certain things are being challenged in court, but I expect them to win more often than they lose. even though there was a decision recently that, that, a lot of those probationary employees that were fired are going to be sent back to work, at least for now.\n\nHere's the part of the discussion where I want to address the real critical issue for investors. And these are two different questions, which is and I'm referring to the people the administration implementing and coming up with these policies. Are these people serious and are these serious people? I think we know the answer to the first question is yes.\n\nAnd ever since then, like clockwork, these numbers, the entitlement spending ratio has been rising relative to non-defense discretionary spending, of which there's just not that much left to cut. So I think DOJ's working on a lot of third derivative distractions, that aren't really worth it. And so here's the part I need everybody to just, you know, settle in.\n\nIt may get you a lot more chaos and disruption than it's worth. And those things are minor in the scheme of things relative to entitlement, spending and interest on the debt. And here is a chart that I've showed before. It starts in the beginning, at the end of the 1960s, when the entitlement system was created. At the time, entitlements had a 1 to 1 relationship with non-defense discretionary spending, which is all the stuff the government spends money on that helps generate growth and productivity.\n\nThese are the things where, U.S. production is. At least 25% of U.S. production is dedicated to export, rather than domestic consumption. So. I understand why they want to do something about the crossover point on the debt. I just don't think that cutting non-defense discretionary programs like USAID and firing 100,000 federal workers is going to get you a lot of bang for the buck.\n\nI don't know exactly how they're going to compute it. I don't know whether there's going to be carve outs or offsets. We'll see. But between the reciprocal tariffs and their tariff retaliations, we're moving in to unprecedented territory, at least from a post war perspective. And the sectors that are most exposed to retaliation are things like aircraft, machinery and parts, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, oilseed farming, plastics, resins, inorganic chemicals.\n\nremember that those were the McKinley tariffs. And they the inflation that resulted from them ended up crushing the Republicans in the midterms. They lost 100 seats in the 1890 midterms. And it was a third largest loss ever. But here you can see various overlays of where we are now and what tariffs could go to. And I believe the the next shoe to drop in early April will be the reciprocal tariffs.\n\nBesson's been out saying that US consumers don't have an entitlement to cheap Chinese goods. It's an indication of the fact that the cabinet members are now accepting the permanence of some of these tariffs, and are trying to get the American public to accept them. Here you can see a chart on the average tariff rate on all U.S. imports going back to around the, you know, 1900.\n\nAssuming they stick and they may not be gone tomorrow. But assuming these tariffs stick we're back to 1950 levels or pre 1950 levels. They're most likely to be inflationary, although not all of them with 100% certainty. And I thought it was notable that that lot neck has begun to say tariffs are worth it, even if they trigger a recession.\n\nThat's been one of the mainstays of our asset allocation recommendation. And even with the minor underperformance that's taking place this year, you can see, the these gaps are incredibly wide. And so to upset the applecart at a time of very high valuations and extended US outperformance is going to be volatile for investors. And so now let's look at the tariff issue.\n\nAnd this is a chart that shows the percentile of all the different cuts you could do on, different valuation metrics for, the US equity markets. And many of the valuation measures were between the 90th and 100 percentiles evaluation. So there wasn't room for error here. And on top of that, what's happening now is coming after a period of really exceptional US equity market outperformance, around 15 years, the US has been crushing Europe and Japan for many of our clients.\n\nAnd it's been painful for manufacturing communities who suffered the brunt of that. So dismantling parts of this is going to be expensive for consumers, and it's going to take a hit on profits. The other thing that the administration has had to deal with is they they haven't said as much and they refused to say as much, but they inherited a stable economy with declining inflation expectations, plenty of liquidity and very high equity valuations.\n\nThe first one is globalization is really well entrenched after 40 years, and it's going to cost money to unwind this. and even even with the best of intentions and a scalpel like precision, it would be expensive to unwind this because this has been essentially a windfall for investors through higher profits. And it's been a windfall for consumers in the form of lower import prices.\n\nNow, I'm not in favor of politically what's taking place right now, but I just wanted to show you the backdrop. So you might think that with all these slides, I came here to praise the administration. Rather to bury them. that's not quite the case for investors. there are some issues here and here. I'm going to go through some of the problems for investors with the way that this administration is trying to solve many of these issues that they've cited.\n\nHe's updating the numbers for me. But just look at this. The red line is the liberal to conservative ratio of the American public. There's a slightly higher line, which is the liberal to conservative ratio of first year university students. And then that skyrocketed in blue Line is the liberal to conservative ratio of university faculty. And I don't think that these numbers can inexorably separate from each other before you, before something happens.\n\nAnd they also say they're trying to address the fentanyl flows from Mexico, which, which have been rising extremely rapidly, since around 2018. And then the last thing that I would mention that the administration is reacting to is an increased ideological conformity on college campuses. this is a chart from, professor at Sarah Lawrence College that it only goes through 2015.\n\nAnd another 10% or so, 150,000 a year, of, undocumented workers and or whatever you want to call them, not getting into that debate. And then at in the Biden administration, those numbers surged where you had almost 3 million people a year of unauthorized entrance. And so part of what's happening is a response to that. And by the way, the public polling is 50 to 60% in favor of what the administration is doing on immigration and border security.\n\nand so these are the kinds of things that that, efforts to add on to the Obama administration, they worked on as well, that they're trying to solve. and then with respect to border security, I think this is helpful context to understand what the administration is doing. for the for for about 15 to 18 years, there was about a million people a year of authorized legal permanent residents coming in.\n\nAnd, the General Accounting Office does cite it's interesting that they can compute this. They estimate around two, 200 to $250 billion a year in, in improper federal government payments. So they can identify after the fact that 200 to $250 billion a year are spent improperly, but they don't have the systems in place to prevent those payments from being made in advance.\n\nSo, I personally don't believe that Doge is a serious effort at addressing this, and we'll talk about that in a few minutes. But this is the underlying issue that Doge was created to address, which is federal debt sustainability. and again, this issue that we have this crossover point coming in less than a decade at least at this point.\n\nThey're also say they're trying to fix federal debt sustainability. And many of our clients know that, I've been talking about this chart probably for 20 years. It's about the crossover point and the point at which federal government revenues are eclipsed only by interest. And on the federal debt and entitlements. It now looks like early in the 2030s that's going to happen.\n\nand if you read the bullet points of what they said would happen, it looks like exactly what's happened. And that expansion would trigger an extended debate over NATO's cost. And we'll call into question the U.S. commitment to the alliance. That's exactly what's happened. And so, this isn't to question Russian against Russian aggression against Ukraine, but this is part of the ideological basis that the administration is using to revisit it.\n\nI'm just going to show you here briefly. You can read it on your own, but there was a June 1997 letter to President Clinton from Bill Bradley, Gary Hart, Sam Nunn, Paul Nitze, Stansfield Turner, Robert McNamara, and and a bunch of other signatories of the Foreign Policy establishment that believed that the NATO expansion was an error and that it would decrease regional security and unsettle European, European stability.\n\nAnd so, you can see here that some of these are as little as two years, but some of them are as long as six years, eight years and 18 years. And, you know this. If I'm doing my job right, everyone's going to have something to be upset about on this call. the, and the transfers to Ukraine have resurfaced a lot of ideas that are hotly debated about the history of conflict in that region.\n\nAnd so there are a lot of legitimate questions, I think, that can be asked about, Chinese infrastructure and Panama. They're also trying to address dwindling U.S. ammunition stockpiles. This chart shows the number of years that that would be required to replenish U.S. ammunition stockpiles for certain key, military items, based on the transfers that have taken place to Ukraine.\n\nSo I think there are a lot of questions that the United States is deservedly asking about what membership in the Chinese belt and Road Initiative entails. And as it relates to Panama, you know, why was Panama the first Latin American signatory to this initiative? you know, there have been a lot of examples of Chinese investment in infrastructure and logistics, electricity generation and construction.\n\nSo, I think there are fair criticisms that can be leveled and an alliance where the farther away you are of the problem, the less used there's, the less you care enough to spend on it. They're also trying to fix the fact that the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative is not just an economic alliance. what this chart is showing is the the orange countries are members of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative, and the red countries are members where there have also been visitations by Chinese military transport aircraft.\n\nAnd you can see here that in 2024, they finally made it. So it took them 18 years to get there. And part of the issue is that the underlying driver of low NATO defense spending appears to be proximity to Russia. So what this chart is showing you is on the x axis, the farther away you are from the Russian border, the lower your defense spending was at least in 2024, and those of the Scandinavian countries at the upper left, or at least most of them in places like Poland.\n\nSo this is the kind of thing that they say they're trying to fix. They're also trying to to address what they refer to as the NATO free riding problem. I've written about this for over 15 years. I think it's a fair issue. NATO made an agreement in 2006 to spend 2% of GDP on defense spending, and it took the NATO countries ex the U.S. almost 20 years to reach that level.\n\nThis complicated rubric, which you may see more of, shows on the right, all the different Chinese suppliers and the products they flow into, which eventually make their way into some of the most critical U.S. national defense systems. So the Chinese supply chain has even infiltrated the U.S. air launched armaments supply chains, which is the most one of the most important parts of national defense.\n\nSo if you're trying to provide geopolitical justifications for those unfavorable tariff arrangements, it's hard to do. They're also trying to fix this chronic deficit in traded goods. it was bad in the 80s when people used to talk about twin deficits, but it's gotten a lot worse since then and again since China joined the World Trade Organization. we've basically had a, roughly 4 to 6% chronic deficit in traded goods and which has made its way into the most critical national defense systems.\n\nIn exchange for their support at the UN. historically, the U.S. has received very low returns on investment for those geopolitical kind of justifications. Here's one analysis of U.S. aid recipient alignment on important U.N. votes. Aside from Israel, the Ukraine, the country of Georgia and Peru, all of the rest of the U.S. aid recipients, voted less than 50% of the time with the U.S., most of them less than a quarter of the time.\n\nAnd while economists will tell you that this is perfectly normal, I think to a lot of people in practice it may not have been and entailed certain costs for manufacturing communities that were very painful. if you look back and try to think where did this lack of tariff reciprocity come from? It occurred during a period when the United States was negotiating favorable tariff deals for other countries.\n\nAnd so they're trying to fix this stagnating industrial production, which is kind of stuck in neutral. And as part of that, the administration believes that that that the lack of tariff reciprocity is part of the problem. The chart here shows a reciprocity line. And as of 2016, when Trump took office, every single country on this chart applied a higher tariff to the United States than the United States charged in return.\n\nAnd I've showed this chart before in a few presentations, and I think in the outlook, ever since China joined the World Trade Organization a couple of decades ago, U.S. consumer spending and GDP have done fine. But U.S. industrial production has been stagnating and that's been leading to all sorts of negative consequences, whether it's rising opioid addictions and suicide rates and falling manufacturing wages relative to service sector and things like that.\n\nI didn't expect it necessarily to take place within the first 50 days. We had that 10% correction. There's been a little bit of a bounce since then. and I still think that there's there's more shoes to drop, but I don't think we're going to have a recession this year. So what is this administration? if you take them at their word, what are they trying to fix?\n\nSo let's get started. Let's see if this thing works. Okay. So remember when I wrote The outlook in the beginning of the year? I said, whatever the goals are, I'm taking these alchemists at their word that they're going to break something. I wasn't sure what it would be, but with valuations as high as they were, I thought that equity markets would end the year higher than they began, but I expected a 10 to 15% correction at some point.\n\nSo, I'm going to take the next hour to walk you through the grand design of this Trump administration. and the issues and challenges that it creates for investors. And I want to start by giving credit to the administration for the things that they're trying to address and that they're trying to solve them. I'm going to try to apply some kind of grand design to this, so that we can understand what the implications are.\n\nso far we've gotten a lot more of the latter than the former. it's interesting. A few months ago, Scott Bassett was quoted as saying, the tariff gun will always be loaded on the table, but rarely discharged. Charming metaphor. Scott should also remember that most gun accidents begin at the home. So, that's, that that gun has been fired a lot more than Scott thought it would be.\n\nGood morning, everybody. This is Michael Cembalest. Thank you very much for joining our webcast. The topic today is chaos versus grand design. Trump 2.0 for investors. it's been a bumpy ride so far this year. I think the street in many ways has gotten it wrong. The perception was that with people like Scott Bezzant and Howard Neck and Chris Wright and the administration that the administration would carefully balance their pro-growth, productivity enhancing policies with their anti-growth inflationary policies.\n\nAs a reminder, investment products are not FDIC insured, do not have bank guarantee, and they may lose value.

We had that 10% correction. There's been a little bit of a bounce since then. and I still think that there's there's more shoes to drop, but I don't think we're going to have a recession this year. So what is this administration? if you take them at their word, what are they trying to fix?\n\n00;07;13;13 - 00;07;39;02\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd I've showed this chart before in a few presentations, and I think in the outlook, ever since China joined the World Trade Organization a couple of decades ago, U.S. consumer spending and GDP have done fine.

And as it relates to Panama, you know, why was Panama the first Latin American signatory to this initiative? you know, there have been a lot of examples of Chinese investment in infrastructure and logistics, electricity generation and construction.\n\n00;12;05;23 - 00;12;36;01\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd so there are a lot of legitimate questions, I think, that can be asked about, Chinese infrastructure and Panama. They're also trying to address dwindling U.S. ammunition stockpiles. This chart shows the number of years that that would be required to replenish U.S. ammunition stockpiles for certain key, military items, based on the transfers that have taken place to Ukraine.\n\n00;12;36;03 - 00;13;03;12\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd so, you can see here that some of these are as little as two years, but some of them are as long as six years, eight years and 18 years. And, you know this. If I'm doing my job right, everyone's going to have something to be upset about on this call. the, and the transfers to Ukraine have resurfaced a lot of ideas that are hotly debated about the history of conflict in that region.\n\n00;13;03;14 - 00;13;33;28\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nI'm just going to show you here briefly. You can read it on your own, but there was a June 1997 letter to President Clinton from Bill Bradley, Gary Hart, Sam Nunn, Paul Nitze, Stansfield Turner, Robert McNamara, and and a bunch of other signatories of the Foreign Policy establishment that believed that the NATO expansion was an error and that it would decrease regional security and unsettle European, European stability.\n\n00;13;34;01 - 00;14;00;28\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nand if you read the bullet points of what they said would happen, it looks like exactly what's happened. And that expansion would trigger an extended debate over NATO's cost. And we'll call into question the U.S. commitment to the alliance. That's exactly what's happened. And so, this isn't to question Russian against Russian aggression against Ukraine, but this is part of the ideological basis that the administration is using to revisit it.\n\n00;14;01;01 - 00;14;26;01\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThey're also say they're trying to fix federal debt sustainability. And many of our clients know that, I've been talking about this chart probably for 20 years. It's about the crossover point and the point at which federal government revenues are eclipsed only by interest. And on the federal debt and entitlements. It now looks like early in the 2030s that's going to happen.\n\n00;14;26;03 - 00;14;48;02\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nSo, I personally don't believe that Doge is a serious effort at addressing this, and we'll talk about that in a few minutes. But this is the underlying issue that Doge was created to address, which is federal debt sustainability. and again, this issue that we have this crossover point coming in less than a decade at least at this point.\n\n00;14;48;04 - 00;15;14;17\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd, the General Accounting Office does cite it's interesting that they can compute this. They estimate around two, 200 to $250 billion a year in, in improper federal government payments. So they can identify after the fact that 200 to $250 billion a year are spent improperly, but they don't have the systems in place to prevent those payments from being made in advance.\n\n00;15;14;19 - 00;15;43;08\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nand so these are the kinds of things that that, efforts to add on to the Obama administration, they worked on as well, that they're trying to solve. and then with respect to border security, I think this is helpful context to understand what the administration is doing. for the for for about 15 to 18 years, there was about a million people a year of authorized legal permanent residents coming in.\n\n00;15;43;11 - 00;16;12;11\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd another 10% or so, 150,000 a year, of, undocumented workers and or whatever you want to call them, not getting into that debate. And then at in the Biden administration, those numbers surged where you had almost 3 million people a year of unauthorized entrance. And so part of what's happening is a response to that. And by the way, the public polling is 50 to 60% in favor of what the administration is doing on immigration and border security.\n\n00;16;12;14 - 00;16;40;11\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd they also say they're trying to address the fentanyl flows from Mexico, which, which have been rising extremely rapidly, since around 2018. And then the last thing that I would mention that the administration is reacting to is an increased ideological conformity on college campuses. this is a chart from, professor at Sarah Lawrence College that it only goes through 2015.\n\n00;16;40;12 - 00;17;07;12\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nHe's updating the numbers for me. But just look at this. The red line is the liberal to conservative ratio of the American public. There's a slightly higher line, which is the liberal to conservative ratio of first year university students. And then that skyrocketed in blue Line is the liberal to conservative ratio of university faculty. And I don't think that these numbers can inexorably separate from each other before you, before something happens.\n\n00;17;07;17 - 00;17;36;09\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nNow, I'm not in favor of politically what's taking place right now, but I just wanted to show you the backdrop. So you might think that with all these slides, I came here to praise the administration. Rather to bury them. that's not quite the case for investors. there are some issues here and here. I'm going to go through some of the problems for investors with the way that this administration is trying to solve many of these issues that they've cited.\n\n00;17;36;12 - 00;18;04;06\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThe first one is globalization is really well entrenched after 40 years, and it's going to cost money to unwind this. and even even with the best of intentions and a scalpel like precision, it would be expensive to unwind this because this has been essentially a windfall for investors through higher profits. And it's been a windfall for consumers in the form of lower import prices.\n\n00;18;04;09 - 00;18;34;15\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd it's been painful for manufacturing communities who suffered the brunt of that. So dismantling parts of this is going to be expensive for consumers, and it's going to take a hit on profits. The other thing that the administration has had to deal with is they they haven't said as much and they refused to say as much, but they inherited a stable economy with declining inflation expectations, plenty of liquidity and very high equity valuations.\n\n00;18;34;20 - 00;19;07;22\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd this is a chart that shows the percentile of all the different cuts you could do on, different valuation metrics for, the US equity markets. And many of the valuation measures were between the 90th and 100 percentiles evaluation. So there wasn't room for error here. And on top of that, what's happening now is coming after a period of really exceptional US equity market outperformance, around 15 years, the US has been crushing Europe and Japan for many of our clients.\n\n00;19;07;22 - 00;19;35;13\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThat's been one of the mainstays of our asset allocation recommendation. And even with the minor underperformance that's taking place this year, you can see, the these gaps are incredibly wide. And so to upset the applecart at a time of very high valuations and extended US outperformance is going to be volatile for investors. And so now let's look at the tariff issue.\n\n00;19;35;13 - 00;19;58;19\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAssuming they stick and they may not be gone tomorrow. But assuming these tariffs stick we're back to 1950 levels or pre 1950 levels. They're most likely to be inflationary, although not all of them with 100% certainty. And I thought it was notable that that lot neck has begun to say tariffs are worth it, even if they trigger a recession.\n\n00;19;58;21 - 00;20;21;15\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nBesson's been out saying that US consumers don't have an entitlement to cheap Chinese goods. It's an indication of the fact that the cabinet members are now accepting the permanence of some of these tariffs, and are trying to get the American public to accept them. Here you can see a chart on the average tariff rate on all U.S. imports going back to around the, you know, 1900.\n\n00;20;21;17 - 00;20;47;02\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nremember that those were the McKinley tariffs. And they the inflation that resulted from them ended up crushing the Republicans in the midterms. They lost 100 seats in the 1890 midterms. And it was a third largest loss ever. But here you can see various overlays of where we are now and what tariffs could go to. And I believe the the next shoe to drop in early April will be the reciprocal tariffs.\n\n00;20;47;03 - 00;21;14;21\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nI don't know exactly how they're going to compute it. I don't know whether there's going to be carve outs or offsets. We'll see. But between the reciprocal tariffs and their tariff retaliations, we're moving in to unprecedented territory, at least from a post war perspective. And the sectors that are most exposed to retaliation are things like aircraft, machinery and parts, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, oilseed farming, plastics, resins, inorganic chemicals.\n\n00;21;14;24 - 00;21;43;15\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThese are the things where, U.S. production is. At least 25% of U.S. production is dedicated to export, rather than domestic consumption. So. I understand why they want to do something about the crossover point on the debt. I just don't think that cutting non-defense discretionary programs like USAID and firing 100,000 federal workers is going to get you a lot of bang for the buck.\n\n00;21;43;17 - 00;22;11;15\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nIt may get you a lot more chaos and disruption than it's worth. And those things are minor in the scheme of things relative to entitlement, spending and interest on the debt. And here is a chart that I've showed before. It starts in the beginning, at the end of the 1960s, when the entitlement system was created. At the time, entitlements had a 1 to 1 relationship with non-defense discretionary spending, which is all the stuff the government spends money on that helps generate growth and productivity.\n\n00;22;11;18 - 00;22;35;21\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd ever since then, like clockwork, these numbers, the entitlement spending ratio has been rising relative to non-defense discretionary spending, of which there's just not that much left to cut. So I think DOJ's working on a lot of third derivative distractions, that aren't really worth it. And so here's the part I need everybody to just, you know, settle in.\n\n00;22;35;23 - 00;22;56;12\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nHere's the part of the discussion where I want to address the real critical issue for investors. And these are two different questions, which is and I'm referring to the people the administration implementing and coming up with these policies. Are these people serious and are these serious people? I think we know the answer to the first question is yes.\n\n00;22;56;12 - 00;23;18;11\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThese people are very serious. they've done their homework. They clearly understand the Administrative Procedures Act. The the approaches that they've take to do certain things are being challenged in court, but I expect them to win more often than they lose. even though there was a decision recently that, that, a lot of those probationary employees that were fired are going to be sent back to work, at least for now.\n\n00;23;18;13 - 00;23;42;20\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nBut the second question is the one that's really important for investors, because it has to do with valuations and multiples and predictability. And the question is are these serious people? And I'm not sure that the answer is yes. And I want to show you why in about five slides. So are these serious people. Trump has said the Chips act is a horrible, horrible thing.\n\n00;23;42;22 - 00;24;02;05\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nOkay. Is that a serious statement? The US, as you can see, there's a chart here on the left that looks at US semiconductor reliance on Taiwan. You can cut it different ways. You can look at all chips. You could look at memory chips. You can look at logic chips. The last part looks at advanced logic chips including indirect flows.\n\n00;24;02;08 - 00;24;25;05\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThe US is 90% reliant on on Taiwan. And so the Chips bill, which was a bipartisan effort or at least partially bipartisan, was the first step in decades to try to repatriate some, semiconductor production back in US soil. And it's in Arizona, and it's taking a while to build. And labor costs are high, but you've got to start someplace.\n\n00;24;25;07 - 00;24;46;08\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThe chart on the right is the number in thousands of semiconductor Chinese semiconductors in U.S. critical military platforms. So when you look at the backdrop here, there may be things you want to change about the Chip act, but to simply come out and say it was a horrible, horrible thing flies in the face of this critical national security issue.\n\n00;24;46;10 - 00;25;14;26\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nChip companies are reportedly already calling their lawyers to assess whether the administration can terminate signed contracts. And the Commerce Department has laid off around a third of the chief office employees. So if this is the direction this is going, I'm not sure serious people would do this. Next issue and this is on the issue of Canada, where Trump has said we're subsidizing Canada to the tune of $200 billion a year.\n\n00;25;14;26 - 00;25;36;17\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThis can't continue. The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished 51st state. Okay, after I read that long tweet on Truth Social, I picked myself up off the floor. And then I started to look at the actual numbers and, Canada actually represents, as you can see on the left, one of the smallest components of the US trade deficit.\n\n00;25;36;19 - 00;26;13;06\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd despite it being one of the largest trading partners with the US, the implication being that the terms of trade on a bilateral basis are fair and the US actually runs a trade surplus with Canada. Once you remove energy and look, the issue with energy is produce more of it as you can. But Canada sells us oil and critical minerals and zinc and solarium and nickel and vanadium, and energy and critical minerals purchased from Canada by the US is a deliberate strategy by the US to reduce reliance.\n\n00;26;13;06 - 00;26;45;29\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd when we used to get those things, which is China and the Middle East, and so the notion that somehow bilateral energy deficits with Canada represents subsidies, it makes no sense economically, it makes no sense politically. And it doesn't even make any sense geologically. And so I'm not sure that serious people would say this, un doge. I mean, again, everybody I think that I've talked to understands the need for eliminating fraud, waste and cutting certain government programs.\n\n00;26;46;02 - 00;27;07;26\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nBut, what's come out of Dodge recently? Massive amounts of misinformation on this whole Social Security payment. The dead people issue. We had a link in the prior I in the market to a, the Boston College Center for Retirement Research debunked all of those issues. there have been calls from Doge people to impeach judges when those actions were judicially reversed.\n\n00;27;08;03 - 00;27;32;28\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nI'm not sure that a serious person would do that. The Doge website reports of its savings are riddled with errors and constantly changing, and now the website is taking steps to make some of its errors harder to find. And just as an example, Doge fired and then rehired 350 people at the National Nuclear Security Administration, including people who assemble and reassemble nuclear warheads.\n\n00;27;33;01 - 00;28;08;12\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nRight? Not a serious thing. then is a strategic crypto reserve. Is that really what the country needs right now, given all the challenges that it's facing? Or is that simply or reward to the sector that contribute to the most of of across all the sectors to the president's reelection campaign? Citibank recently was instructed to freeze accounts for habitat for humanity, United Way and the New York Department of Taxation and Finance because they were recipients of green energy grants from the EPA, and they're now being investigated for possible fraud.\n\n00;28;08;15 - 00;28;37;12\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThere was a directive to Columbia University to put the Middle East and African Studies Department into receivership. And then recently, some European tourists, the United States, were detained by Ice, held for several weeks and then deported. I'm not sure that's great for, you know, tourism into the United States. and the Trump administration is also talking about, I read this morning all trading, altering the computation of GDP, in ways that it considers more favorable.\n\n00;28;37;20 - 00;29;07;29\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nSo I'm not sure serious people would be doing these things. And then on science and medical leadership, some of the decisions to cut funding to the NIH, could have effects US science primacy for generations. When I first saw that indirect costs were, on average, 60% of direct costs. I asked the same questions the Trump administration did. Gee, those indirect costs seem kind of high.\n\n00;29;08;01 - 00;29;48;05\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nBut the immediate response of cutting grants and funding, seems like an extreme and preliminary, you know, an overly cautious reaction to that. The NIH has already stopped issuing new awards and has begun withholding funds from grants that had already been awarded. And just as a reminder, the NIH has supported 99% of all the drugs approved by the FDA from 2020 to 2019, and nearly all major medical breakthroughs over the last few decades, including treatments for chronic pain, autoimmune diseases, GLP weight loss drugs, melanoma treatments, RNA vaccines, cervical cancer, you name it.\n\n00;29;48;07 - 00;30;11;05\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd then as it relates to RFK Jr, a lot of you know how I feel about that, he said. Studies have found that vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles, measles mortality. Here's the thing about RFK that where I question if he's a serious person, most of his factoids have kernels of truth in them, which then aren't applicable to the thing that's being discussed.\n\n00;30;11;08 - 00;30;33;21\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd this is a perfect example, because vitamin A supplements can reduce the mortality risk of measles, but mostly in Low Countries where a lot of people have vitamin deficiencies in the first place. In the US, only 0.3% of all people are vitamin deficient, which is why studies have OECD countries show no benefit for vitamin A in measles outbreaks.\n\n00;30;33;24 - 00;30;57;29\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nSo, you know, I am, I'm one of those people. That was I was born in 1962. So I'm one of those people where the MMR vaccine may have fading efficacy, but I have a certain condition where I can't take live vaccines. So I'm actually at risk of having a fading efficacy of my initial MMR vaccine. But I'm unable to get a new one.\n\n00;30;58;07 - 00;31;22;01\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd so if there's a measles outbreak and I get sick, I know exactly who to blame. So, here's another one. A lot of people are upset about the chart on the left, and I understand why these are the seven largest pharma companies. And, what you can see is the US taxes they paid versus the foreign taxes they paid.\n\n00;31;22;03 - 00;31;47;17\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd so this is one of the things where people say, that's why we need tariffs. Because U.S. companies are gaming the system. Are US pharma companies gaming the system by shifting profits offshore? Yes. But when did they start doing that? As you can see on the right, they started doing it after Trump's own tax bill was passed based on a low, highly favorable tax, on international intangible income.\n\n00;31;47;19 - 00;32;19;04\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd so the US pharma trade deficit didn't start skyrocketing out of control until the 2017 tax bill, solving it by just putting tariffs on the entire pharmaceutical industry is not a serious way of trying to fix this problem. And then, you know, over the last 72 hours, we've had this executive order with respect to law firms whose partners participated in Trump prosecutions or investigations Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss Covington and Burling.\n\n00;32;19;06 - 00;32;53;04\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd what I've listed here is a bunch of the components within those executive orders. So far, five of them have been challenged, and a judge has granted a temporary restraining order. but when you read some of the things in these executive orders, limiting access of these law firms, personnel to enter government buildings or speak to government employees, or investigating third party contractors to see if they have business with some of these law firms unrelated to their government work.\n\n00;32;53;06 - 00;33;22;16\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nI this is not this is not a serious way of dealing with the Justice Department, in my opinion. And the reason this matters for investors, you might be saying, why does any of this matter for investors? Here's why. The rule of law is an integral part of the global primacy of U.S. commerce. And this charts one of the most important charts that I'm always showing investors who are panicked about the dollar as the world's reserve currency.\n\n00;33;22;18 - 00;34;05;02\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThe most important number to look at here is the second bar. The US represents around a quarter of world trade. the US represents a much higher share of cross-border loans, international debt securities, FX transactions, foreign exchange, reserve investments by other central banks, trade invoicing, Swift payments, you name it. The United States. It has a as a primacy role in global commerce because if it's adherence to rule of law, and if that's if the perception of that starts to change, there can be an impact on all of these things multiples, portfolio flows, foreign direct investment, and a lot of things that the administration says that they care about.\n\n00;34;05;04 - 00;34;32;23\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nSo that's what matters for investors. All right. Now, for the remainder of the presentation, I want to talk about how the markets are. By the way, nobody wanted to do this, present this webcast with me. And now I think you can see why, we're going to review how the economy's responding, how the markets are responding, and what are some of the pro-growth, productivity enhancing policies that the administration may pursue that are still to come that will offset some of the negative stuff they've been doing so far?\n\n00;34;32;26 - 00;34;59;28\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nWell, first, it's really important to point out that A, that this is my preferred high frequency indicator of the economy. it comes from the Dallas Fed and it's got retail sales, fuel sales, electricity output, unemployment claims. And it's very stable. As if anything, it's actually kind of ticking up. So contemporaneous real time measures of U.S growth still look good.\n\n00;35;00;02 - 00;35;24;13\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nWhat's changing is a rapid shift in some of the leading indicators, some of which are surveys and could reverse. But I just want to show you what they are. I think the first and the first leading indicator we need to talk about is inflation expectations, because this is what puts the fed in a box, which is if growth weakens at the same time that inflation expectations are going up, that's difficult.\n\n00;35;24;13 - 00;35;53;18\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nIf you're if you're in charge of monetary policy on the left, you can see surveys of prices paid in both the manufacturing and services sector. Again, to be clear, nowhere near the surge that took place, during the Biden inflation period of 2021 2022. But those numbers starting to rise again. And then on the right, some of the University of Michigan and New York fed surveys of of medium term and long term inflation expectations, the short term ones are rising.\n\n00;35;53;18 - 00;36;24;23\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nBut now some of the medium term inflation expectations are rising too. And some important actual measures of inflation are starting to tick up. This one looks at the producer price report and digs in, and looks at what's called stage three producers who buy intermediate inputs that are affected by tariffs. And maybe some of this is just people buying in advance of tariff imposition.\n\n00;36;24;29 - 00;36;40;24\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nBut these stage three goods are plastic bottles, rubber hoses, tires, concrete, structural steel, motor vehicle parts wiring devices. So you can see that these stage three input costs are beginning to go up again.\n\n00;36;40;26 - 00;37;05;27\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nHow are consumers responding? I tend to not get too carried away with this kind of stuff, because they tend not to be great leading indicators of what happens to, equity markets and credit markets. But I did want to show you that consumer sentiment is rolled over. And then on the right one of the questions in the University of Michigan Sentiment survey is, what do you expect to happen in the unemployment rate over the next year?\n\n00;37;05;27 - 00;37;38;09\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd that number has imploded, to one of the worst observed nations on record since 1990. So, people are the consumers. Households are expecting a real implosion in the job market. so we'll see. So far, the job markets are pretty stable. My favorite leading indicator, and it's my favorite because it's the one that has the closest relationship with what equity markets do next, was rising recently and then just rolled over.\n\n00;37;38;09 - 00;37;56;06\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd it's the new orders less inventories component to the ESM. And so for people that follow this kind of stuff, it makes sense. What are companies doing in terms of their order books for the the orders that they're getting for new equipment and the orders they're putting in for purchasing new equipment, less the inventory accumulation that they're doing.\n\n00;37;56;12 - 00;38;24;28\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nSo and that number is rolled over. And then, as you can see on the right, the small business, the NFB Small Business Survey, perception of capital, future capital spending plans surged after the election. But then that optimism has cratered again to one of the lowest levels on record. And then what's been happening in the actual equity markets? Well, we've had a relief rally since last Friday.\n\n00;38;25;00 - 00;38;49;24\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nthe S&P corrected by around 10% recovered, 2 or 3%. The US has been underperforming, the rest of the global equity markets. And then there's been a much bigger correction in, in the mag seven stocks. And just to touch on that a little bit, here is a valuation chart. And so this for for investors this is actually interesting right.\n\n00;38;49;24 - 00;39;15;06\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nBecause if you look at that gold line the Mag seven PE ratios have gone way down. So for people deploying money at least since 2018 this is one of the lowest valuation environments. If you believe the forward earnings projections and then the S&P ex the Mag seven you know has has corrected modestly compared to where we've been. some I think there's more to come here obviously.\n\n00;39;15;06 - 00;39;40;16\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nBut Trump's Department of Justice filed a brief arguing that Google should be forced to divest of of Chrome. and also no longer be able to make their default search engine payments to Apple and things like that. That may be negatively affecting sentiment, but one of the biggest issues facing the Mag seven stocks is what's happening with Tesla.\n\n00;39;40;19 - 00;40;09;29\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nthe JP Morgan investment Bank is forecasting another 50% decline in the stock to just $120 a share. That was a report that they issued last week. And then I've shown here on the page there are some ferocious sales declines outside the United States for Tesla. looking at January, February sales down 70% in Australia, 70 something percent in Germany, 50% in China, 40 to 50% in Scandinavia, 25% in France.\n\n00;40;10;02 - 00;40;38;06\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThis is kind of a global schadenfreude, a reaction to what Musk has been up to. and so, and then down 11% in the US. So, that's been an issue for, for Tesla as well. The a lot of the questions we get obviously is about what's happening with policy rates and then what's happening with ten year interest rates.\n\n00;40;38;09 - 00;41;03;04\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThis chart is important to understand it. There's only been about seven cycles in which the fed has eased like over the last 30 years. And almost every time the fed eases, you start the clock and then the ten year either stays flat or goes down. This time the ten year started to rise and it started rising. Around the time that it became clear that Trump was likely to win the election.\n\n00;41;03;07 - 00;41;31;20\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThis was a barometer, in my opinion, that, the markets were expecting inflationary policies out of the administration. and I still think that's the case. We still have a ten year that's around 1% higher than it was, since the Fed's first cut. we may end up with lower rates on the ten year, but in the beginning of the year, the market perception was that you could get a growth and productivity surge that would allow rates to go down.\n\n00;41;31;23 - 00;41;52;27\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nin a strong environment. I no longer think that's the case. We're going to we're going to have rates of four and a half to 5%. And the only reason that rates go below four is if you have a growth collapse. so that kind of benign decline in rates I think is off the table right now. And, high yield spreads are starting to rise, but from very low levels.\n\n00;41;52;27 - 00;42;23;03\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd, and I wouldn't describe the, the increase in high yield spreads as, as particularly problematic right now, they have risen to just 300 basis points for double B in single B spreads, which I don't think is is anywhere near fair value. But as a as a response to what's going on, this is a rather tepid response. And one of the reasons is that default rates in high yield and leveraged loans and private credit are still running at very low rates of around 2%.\n\n00;42;23;05 - 00;42;46;22\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nand the Europe's been outperforming the US so far this year, but not by more than it has in recent years, where kind of every once in a while Europe will outperform the US by 10% or so and then roll over again. Now what's happening here this time around is a little more interesting. You're seeing a move towards more European stimulus and things like that.\n\n00;42;46;24 - 00;43;17;25\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nBut, I don't know. I would rather take my chances outside the US. in, in, in places like Japan, where there are some interesting corporate governance changes going on than, than in Europe. But that said, there the US, this chart is on the PE discount of Europe versus the US and Europe, even after it's outperformed this year, is still trading at a 35% PE discount to the US, which is kind of remarkable.\n\n00;43;17;27 - 00;43;46;16\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nSo let me close with what are so what are the pro-growth productivity policies of the administration that everyone thought were going to be rolled out contemporaneously with the tariffs? that would eventually kind of make investors and profits and multiples, react positively. So let's talk through those. One of them is the pace of government regulation. And that takes time.\n\n00;43;46;18 - 00;44;18;14\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd the impacts are long dated. the pace of government regulation obviously should slow. This is a chart on economically significant rules by presidency. Trump was on a low GOP like path until Covid hit. And then in the beginning of 2020, obviously, all of a sudden there were all sorts of Covid related regulations that took place. But Trump during his first administration, was on track to be a low regulation president.\n\n00;44;18;16 - 00;44;41;11\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd I, I fully expect that to be the case here as well. Why wouldn't it be? They're dismantling a lot of the entities that that do regulating in the first place. I on this one, I do want to mention there was a study that came out from Yale's budget lab yesterday, about how the Trump administration might want to cut, headcount at the IRS.\n\n00;44;41;14 - 00;45;05;19\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nSo if the IRS shrinks by 50%, which is a workforce decrease of about 50,000 people, Yale Budget Lab estimates that this could result in a $400 billion forgone revenue, over the next ten year budget window. And if the lack of IRS resources leads to a substantial increase in noncompliance, which is tax evasion, the numbers could be much higher than that.\n\n00;45;05;21 - 00;45;37;25\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nSo, something to keep an eye on. Basel the Basel three project will probably be abandoned. certainly. I don't think this administration has mentioned anything they want to do to support it that could boost the credit supply as banks reduce accumulated capital. So if I can just explain for a minute the Basel three proposal would have required the big banks, the category 1 or 2 banks to increase, their capital by about $2 trillion.\n\n00;45;37;27 - 00;46;08;07\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd in advance of Basel three being implemented, a lot of banks began to accumulate the necessary capital to do that. If Basel three is now dead, presumably that capital would flow back out into the economy and terms and conditions on credit would loosen, which could help growth. I think they'll be. I think Trump will continue to negotiate deals with other countries where to avoid tariffs if they make sufficient foreign direct investments in the US.\n\n00;46;08;10 - 00;46;29;27\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nthat would be helpful. In other words, more examples of the of the deal that was struck with TSMC to start investing in US semiconductor production. you can see in Trump's first term, there was a surge in the inward share of global foreign direct investment in the United States. And then again during the period of the post-Covid focus on domestic resiliency.\n\n00;46;29;29 - 00;46;34;18\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nSo more of those deals would help.\n\n00;46;34;20 - 00;46;58;25\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThere is a lot of discussion now about European rearmament, which is being imposed on them essentially by the United States, that if it happens, that would be an indirect benefit to U.S. defense contractors, at least so far as we can tell. If you look at European weapons spending, since 2022, more than half of it went to U.S. defense contractors.\n\n00;46;58;28 - 00;47;21;05\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nSo, if they continue to rearm as much as they may try to spend a lot of that money domestically, they I think, would be required to spend some of that money with U.S. defense contractors simply because they don't always have all the products and services and procurement equipment that would be needed. I think a lot of people are familiar with the administration's view on oil and gas production.\n\n00;47;21;08 - 00;47;45;06\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAlthough if you if you look at, crude oil, natural gas and NGL production, it went to an all time high under the Biden administration. The Biden administration was not about sticks against the oil and gas industry. They were focused on incentives for the renewable industry to the tune of anywhere from 1 to 2 trillion, depending upon how you compute them.\n\n00;47;45;09 - 00;48;14;06\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nbut they weren't as restrictive in terms of actual oil and gas production as people sometimes think, which is why Besson's target is only a 5 to 7% increase. in overall fossil fuel production compared to current levels. And since some of that is going to end up exported, through LNG relationships, I don't see how much benefit that's going to have in terms of reducing, energy costs.\n\n00;48;14;08 - 00;48;38;11\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nNow, this will be interesting. If they can do this, I would really kind of tip my hat to the administration over the last few years, it's gotten close to impossible to build transmission for renewable projects or pipelines for oil and gas projects. And the Trump administration says they're focused on permitting reform. If they can get that done, that would be impressive.\n\n00;48;38;14 - 00;48;56;02\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nI'm going to watch this chart, on on, pipeline growth and transmission line growth and we'll see what happens. That's a kind of a long dated benefit. But these are the kind of things the administration says they're going to focus on, which would be growth enhancing if they could get them done.\n\n00;48;56;04 - 00;49;27;25\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd as it relates to the stimulus bill, this is a brutally complicated chart. So I'm not going to walk through it. I'm simply going to say that even if they can get this reconciliation bill passed, extending tax cuts is not stimulus. And that's all they're really trying to do, is pass a reconciliation bill, which will extend the personal and corporate tax cuts that were embedded in the 2017 bill and everything else outside of that is reshuffling the deck there.\n\n00;49;27;25 - 00;50;03;22\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd this is one iteration, right? The bill hasn't passed, but this is one iteration that we've written about recently. And what's going on in this chart is, they're they would aim to cut, about 800 billion for Medicaid, get rid of the Biden student loan forgiveness, and increase the, at the same time that they would increase the salt cap, they would claw back about 500 billion from Biden's energy bill, mostly EV charging other EV projects and a little bit of a clawback on the wind and solar, ITC, PTC incentives.\n\n00;50;03;25 - 00;50;20;14\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nThey would want to have no income tax on tips. So manufacturing incentives mean maybe no taxes on overtime, an increase in homeland security. But most of this is just deck shuffling with a modest increase in the deficit compared to the CBO baseline.\n\n00;50;20;16 - 00;50;47;11\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nSo wrapping up. I think we titled this presentation chaos versus Grand Design. I think chaos is part of the grand design. There's a deliberate amount of chaos in this grand design that investors are going to have to get used to, and which credit spreads and p multiples and valuations of real estate and cross-border capital flows will eventually start to reflect as well.\n\n00;50;47;14 - 00;51;08;03\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nSo what do we have here? I think we have a growth slowdown. JP morgan's investment banking economists have already started to publish on that. I think we get a growth slowdown but no recession. the economic consequences of some of this chaos are hard to predict. Remember, the tariff rates are now going back to before all or most of us on this call were born.\n\n00;51;08;05 - 00;51;29;15\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nI do think there's another shoe to drop with the imposition of some kind of reciprocal tariff. A big issue was whether or not the administration includes that taxes in Europe as part of that reciprocity. And but just to be clear, corrections like we've had are not uncommon over the last hundred years. A 10% correction like the one we've had happened more than half the time.\n\n00;51;29;15 - 00;52;00;17\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nIt happened at 60% of all years. And a 15% correction happened 40% of the time. And in years with those 10 to 20% corrections, full stock market returns have still averaged 15%. So the fact that a correction is taking place doesn't necessarily tell you that the full year returns are problematic, or there's more bad news to come. I personally think a 15% decline from the peak levels, which is about 5200 on the S&P, would be a clearer sign of capitulation.\n\n00;52;00;20 - 00;52;31;23\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nI'd also like to see high yield spread credit spreads go above 400 basis points. Those are the kind of things that would make me personally feel more comfortable advising investors to take some of their spare liquidity and put it to work. And the other thing is, as I have been a stronger advocate for a US centric portfolio than almost anybody in the on the buy side in the industry, but the US is 60, around 63% of a global diversified equity portfolio.\n\n00;52;31;23 - 00;53;08;17\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nIf you believe the MSCI weights, if you're 85% plus, I would consider some rebalancing at this point because I think that the administration, oddly enough, with its American America First agenda that may not translate into American first outperformance in the equity markets. And then one last comment. you know, I we've written a lot about how the hyperscalers may have overspent in the near term relative to demand for compute infrastructure, but the productivity benefits for the corporate sector from AI adoption should gradually start to show up in earnings.\n\n00;53;08;19 - 00;53;32;19\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nI do believe there's more substance to that than the last round of stuff we had with hydrogen and the metaverse and things like that. I do think that there are some real productivity and earnings benefits to come from AI adoption. and that that could partially offset some of the costs related to a higher tariff world. the next project that we're all going to work on, on my team is health care.\n\n00;53;32;21 - 00;54;01;26\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd as you can see in this very messy chart, this looks at, consensus forward return on equity on the x axis relative to price to book ratios on the y axis. Bottom line is that most of these things tend to move together. Valuations tend to go up as you make more money. but the cheapest sectors on this chart are health care providers, the overall health care sector, large cap pharma and biotech.\n\n00;54;01;29 - 00;54;26;03\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd, it's going to require us to do some deciphering of how this administration is going to deal with, its ability to have Medicaid and Medicare CMS re negotiate the price of, of non generic drugs. So anyway, that's our next project. Thank you all very much for dialing in. I hope there was something that was triggering and offensive to just about everybody.\n\n00;54;26;05 - 00;54;37;05\n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nAnd, I appreciate your continued. following of our investment research. That's all for today. Bye.\n\n00;54;37;07 - 00;54;48;22\n\nVoice Announcement\n\nThank you for joining us.

            "content": "As the banking industry braces for these shifts, billionaires are paying close attention. Over the past ten years, billionaires have gotten much richer, growing their wealth faster than the stock market. From 2015 to 2024, their total fortune more than doubled, going from $6.3 trillion to $14 trillion. In comparison, the MSCI World Index only grew by 73%. The number of billionaires also increased, from 1,757 in 2015 to 2,682 in 2024. However, since 2020, this growth has slowed to just 1% per year, mainly because wealthy people in China have been losing money. Meanwhile, billionaires in the US, Europe, and India are still seeing their wealth grow. Tech billionaires have gained the most, with their total wealth tripling from $789 billion to $2.4 trillion.\n\nAccording to Morningstar DBRS, the US banking sector is expected to remain stable in 2025, with banks benefiting from a better operating environment, an improved yield curve, and steady economic growth. Loan demand should pick up, and banks have managed to maintain strong liquidity, capital levels, and profitability, putting them in a good position for the year ahead. While credit ratings for banks are not expected to change significantly, some could see positive adjustments if current trends continue. However, if interest rates stay high for longer than expected, it could put pressure on consumers and businesses. Trade conflicts or geopolitical tensions could also slow down economic growth. On the bright side, higher loan demand and a steeper yield curve could boost banks\u2019 earnings, with many predicting record net interest income (NII) in 2025.\n\nFor banks, a big challenge will be maintaining growth despite these economic headwinds. With interest rates dropping, net interest income is expected to decline, and deposit costs may stay high as banks compete to retain customers. Mortgage loan demand is likely to pick up, but credit card and auto loans could see slower growth as consumers tighten their wallets. Meanwhile, corporate borrowing should remain steady, with potential growth in debt issuance and M&A if economic and political uncertainty settles down.\n\nAs 2025 kicks off, bank executives are facing a mix of optimism and uncertainty. Inflation is easing, and interest rates are coming down, but challenges like slow economic growth, geopolitical instability, and shifting regulations are keeping industry leaders on edge. According to Deloitte, while the US economy outperformed expectations in 2024 with a 2.7% GDP growth rate, things are expected to slow in 2025, with projections around 1.5%. Rising unemployment, weaker business investment, and high consumer debt, which now stands at a record $17.7 trillion, could put additional pressure on the financial system.\n\nWe recently published a list of 15 Best Bank Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires . In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against other best bank stocks to invest in.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn Europe, billionaire investors are making their presence felt in the banking sector. Italy\u2019s banking sector is going through a major change, and two billionaire families, Del Vecchio and Caltagirone, are making big moves to stay in control. They have built up significant stakes in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (Paschi), positioning themselves to influence the mergers and acquisitions wave that is picking up speed. The government wants to turn Paschi into the country\u2019s third major bank, while other lenders are scrambling to strike their own deals. Caltagirone and Del Vecchio have only tightened their grip, buying more Paschi shares to ensure a say in its future. While they are focused on financial gains, they also align with the government\u2019s vision for a stronger banking system. Caltagirone, who\u2019s close to the Meloni administration, sees Paschi as the foundation for Italy\u2019s next banking giant.\n\nMeanwhile, in the US, Warren Buffett remains a dominant force in the financial sector. Known for his long-term investment strategy, Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway has a history of outperforming the market, delivering an average annual return of 12.1% over the past two decades, slightly ahead of the broader market\u2019s 11.5%. He has long favored financial stocks for their steady profits and reliable dividends, particularly those with strong management teams. However, his recent decision to sell nearly $1 billion in shares of a major US bank, along with stakes in other financial institutions, signals a potential shift in strategy. This move could reflect concerns about the banking sector or a search for better opportunities elsewhere. Despite the sell-off, Buffett remains deeply invested in the bank he trimmed his position in, still holding a massive $30 billion stake.\n\nIs JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) Among The Best Bank Stocks To Buy According To Billionaires? (ready for edit 2)\n\nA group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe analyzed Insider Monkey\u2019s exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to compile our list of the best bank stocks to invest in according to billionaires. We picked 15 best bank stocks to buy based on the highest number of billionaire investors, updated as of Q4 2024. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world\u2019s leading hedge funds and companies.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 14\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), an American multinational banking and financial services giant, ranks 8th on our list of the best bank stocks to buy. In February 2025, the company declared a big move in private credit, announcing at its 30th annual Global Leveraged Finance Conference that it is committing $50 billion from its balance sheet, plus nearly $15 billion from co-lenders. This expansion aims to strengthen its direct lending capabilities and offer tailored credit solutions for clients\u2019 changing needs.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) reported a 50% jump in net income to $14 billion and a 10% rise in net revenue to $43.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. While net interest income dipped 3% to $23.5 billion, noninterest revenue surged 29% to $20.3 billion. Operating expenses dropped 7% to $22.8 billion, but after adjusting for last year\u2019s $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment, they actually rose 5%, mainly due to higher pay, brokerage costs, and tech investments. The bank also set aside $2.6 billion for credit losses, with net charge-offs rising to $2.4 billion, mostly from Card Services.\n\nOn March 12, Truist Securities maintained a Hold rating on JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) with a $268 price target. CFO Jeremy Barnum noted slight weakness in consumer spending but emphasized the bank\u2019s stability and 14-year dividend growth.\n\nOverall, JPM ranks 8th on our list of the best bank stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of JPM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JPM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

He noted that the Fed does not need to rush to make policy adjustments and \"is well positioned to wait for clarity\" on President Donald Trump's economic plans, including tariffs.\n\n\"Everybody is forecasting some inflation effect from tariffs,\" Powell stated at the press conference. \"We're going to have to wait and see all of that.\"\n\nThe move to hold rates steady was expected. Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, told Entrepreneur in an emailed statement that the lack of change to the rate was \"unsurprising.\"\n\n\"I continue to admire the Fed's patience as we all await further clarity on the feed-through effects of trade policy right now, but I think investors will be craving clearer direction out of the FOMC meetings ahead,\" Ausenbaugh stated.\n\nRelated: 3 Predictions for the U.S. Economy in 2025, According to a Chief Economist\n\nMeanwhile, Melissa Cohn, regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage and a 43-year mortgage industry veteran, told Entrepreneur in a separate emailed statement that if tariffs and higher inflation occurred, future rate cuts would be unlikely.\n\n\"What happens in the economy in the next three months will be the driver of future rate movement from the Fed,\" she stated.\n\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nFed policymakers on Wednesday also predicted higher unemployment and less economic growth this year than they did in December. According to Fox Business, policymakers projected that real gross domestic product (GDP) would grow by 1.7% by the end of the year, down from a 2.1% prediction in December. They also forecasted an unemployment rate of 4.4% in December, up from a previous prediction of 4.3%.\n\nThe unemployment rate was 4.1% and inflation was at 2.8% in February, per the latest federal data. The Fed's goal is to maintain low prices and drive full employment.\n\nThe Fed also held rates steady in January, following three preceding cuts in September, November, and December.",

JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. et al., filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, plaintiff Alexandro Gonzalez claimed that JPMorgan Chase Bank failed to objectively and adequately review the plan\u2019s investment offerings, initially and on an ongoing basis, with due care to ensure each investment option was prudent in terms of performance.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, the plan had more than $44 billion in assets under management and 295,407 participants. Gonzalez\u2019s complaint argues that, as a jumbo plan, the plan had substantial bargaining power regarding the fees and expenses charged against participants\u2019 investments.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, fiduciaries at JPMorgan allowed substantial assets in the 401(k) plan to be invested in the JPMorgan Stable Value Fund that invested in synthetic guaranteed investment contracts offered by MetLife, Prudential Financial, Transamerica and Voya Financial.\n\nGICs are issued by insurance companies in the form of a fixed annuity contract.\n\n\u201cA prudent fiduciary would not have included this underperforming investment option that also carried significantly more risk than other investment options that had similar goals, i.e., preservation of investment assets,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nThe complaint also states that a more prudent fiduciary could have demanded higher crediting rates from the insurance companies by submitting requests for proposals to the insurance companies and other providers of stable value investments.\n\nIn addition, the plaintiff alleges that the insurance companies \u201cbenefited significantly\u201d from participants in the plan investing in the stable value fund. The complaint states that the crediting rates the insurance companies provided to the plan \u201cwere and are so low that the insurance companies reaped a windfall on the spread.\u201d\n\nThe complaint also accuses JPMorgan of failing to monitor its investment committee to ensure that it was adequately performing its fiduciary obligations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.\n\nThe plaintiff is asking the court to declare that JPMorgan breached its fiduciary duties under ERISA and order the company both to disgorge all profits received from the plan and to make good on all plan losses resulting from \u201cimprudent investment of the plan\u2019s assets,\u201d among other demands.\n\nGonzalez is represented by law firm Capozzi Adler P.C. in the case.\n\nJPMorgan declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThe bank was also sued last week by current and former health plan participants who allege the company mismanaged the prescription drug benefit under its health insurance offering.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A chaotic run in stock markets is unleashing a windfall for banks\u2019 equities traders.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is on track to boost revenue from equities trading by more than 30% this quarter from a year earlier, according to people with knowledge of the matter. If the trajectory holds, the firm would surpass its $3.3 billion record set four years ago.\n\nSuch a trend could spell even bigger bounties at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley, which typically vie for the industry\u2019s stock-trading crown. While JPMorgan\u2019s increase is particularly steep, Goldman\u2019s equities unit is also running ahead of its pace last year, when it reaped $3.3 billion in the first three months, the people said, asking not to be named because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly.\n\nMarket swoons set off by President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt policy announcements are \u2014 for banks, at least \u2014 creating a rare bright spot amid signs of economic trouble. But the gyrations have tripped up hedge funds, stalled dealmakers\u2019 talks on prospective mergers and shaken consumer confidence.\n\nThe resilience of equities desks is a nod to their evolution since the 2008 financial crisis. Their earnings hinge less on taking risks with their balance sheets and more on facilitating surges in client trading in response to price swings. Individual stock moves have unleashed bursts of derivatives trading, driving up banks\u2019 gains.\n\nRepresentatives for JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.\n\nThe boon for banks contrasts with the impact on multistrategy hedge funds \u2014 the big, all-weather investing platforms geared toward eking out gains irrespective of market conditions. The two largest, Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel and Izzy Englander\u2019s Millennium Management, posted rare losses in February and slumped further in early March.\n\nThere\u2019s pain in other corners of investment banks. Some dealmakers are ruing predictions that Trump\u2019s return to the White House would unleash a wave of activity. Instead, they\u2019re grousing about the uncertainty created by sudden tariff proclamations. The volume of new transactions announced globally this year is lower than at the start of 2024.\n\nMorgan Stanley Co-President Dan Simkowitz said as much on Tuesday. Merger and acquisition announcements and new equity issuance are \u201ccertainly on pause\u201d as clients assess Trump\u2019s policies, he said at a conference hosted by his bank.",

The bank also promised \"upgraded\" dining options.\n\nPolaris employees who spoke to BI said they were unimpressed with some of the solutions offered in the Monday memo, including the off-site parking.\n\n\"The last thing that I want to do after a full day of work is stand with a group of my coworkers, hope there is enough room on the next bus, ride for 10 minutes to my car parked at the mall, and then drive home,\" said a product manager who commutes about 30 minutes one-way to Polaris. He said he'll try to get to the office early to avoid the hassle.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in January called the bank's hybrid workers, who made up less than 30% of its total headcount, back to the office five days a week starting in March. The RTO deadline for employees of the Columbus office was delayed to give the bank time to get it ready.\n\n\"Our teams have been working hard to ensure our sites have the capacity and amenities employees will need to return to the office full-time,\" a spokesperson told BI, adding, \"We have about 12,000 employees working in Polaris. We would not have asked employees to return if we did not have the capacity to accommodate them.\"\n\nPolaris, which houses many of the bank's tech workers and is key to several of its cloud-focused initiatives, was built to accommodate some 12,000 workers. According to internal documents about the property reviewed by Business Insider, the site is home to 13,601 employees with a total seating capacity of 11,930.\n\nThe JPMorgan spokesperson said the 13,000 number includes \"engineers, service staff, security guards, and other folks who aren't in the building daily.\"\n\nEmployees, meanwhile, continue to complain about what they perceive as a lack of desks, parking, or conference rooms, including in employee group chats. In one recent chat, employees discussed a document that appeared to outline how the bank might enforce its RTO mandate, as BI reported last week.\n\nRelated stories\n\nFood upgrades\n\nIn addition to parking, the memo also promised of upgraded dining options, such as a \"new chef's table option,\" \"more guest restaurants in the atrium,\" as well as \"an exciting new on-campus dining option\" coming later this fall.\n\nTwo other Polaris-based employees told BI that having more on-site dining choices will be key to ensuring a smooth return now that workers won't want to give up coveted parking spots or take the shuttle to and from their cars. They noted that one of the two cafeterias at Polaris has been closed for years.\n\n\"Leaving for lunch will no longer be an option,\" one software developer told BI.\n\nStill, one expressed concern that even with more on-campus dining options, five days RTO will eat into their productivity.\n\n\"The complaint that we have really is that everybody's lunch is 12 to 1,\" said a different tech worker. \"Trying to go to lunch at that time means you're in a line forever.\"\n\nThe Polaris campus is among JPMorgan's largest at 2 million square feet. It was renovated in 2023 with state-of-the-art technology, including lights that automatically dim in the daytime and water-saving faucets and flushers, according to a JPM press release post-renovation. It is also the site of a leaked town hall with Jamie Dimon in February over the bank's return-to-office mandate.\n\nPolaris workers told BI they are also bracing for a potentially messy desk situation.\n\n\"It's all open seating with no walls between you and the people sitting around you, who may not even work in your department,\" said the product manager. \"Everyone is on their own Zoom calls, which can be distracting if you are trying to put your head down and get work done,\" he added.\n\nWorkers who don't snag a desk are being told to \"just log in using their own device in the atrium or conference center,\" the software engineer said, adding, \"they are so not prepared for this.\"",

Single women are buying homes at more than double the pace of single men despite higher rates of rejection in mortgage applications, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nBank of America Securities suggests in a research report that women during the coming decade will gain the wherewithal for greater shareholder clout.\n\n\u201cBaby boomer\u201d U.S. men \u2014 born between 1946 and 1964 \u2014 will pass on $30 trillion in wealth to their wives and children by 2035, according to Bank of America.\n\n\u201cThis wealth is already being passed down, and it will soon mean that women control more money than ever before,\u201d Bank of America said.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not all: Women now outnumber men at university,\u201d and work and spend more than in previous years, Bank of America said. Also, \u201cthey have strong career aspirations and expect higher pay.\u201d",

(NYSE:JPM) stands against other undervalued S&P 500 stocks to buy now.\n\nEarlier on March 13, Michael Cuggino, President and Portfolio Manager of the Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u2018The Exchange\u2019 and began discussing his fund\u2019s performance. Despite a challenging market environment, his fund achieved a 4% return this year, which he attributed to diversification rather than reliance on a single asset class like gold. The portfolio includes gold, silver, diversified equities, and bonds. When asked about market reactions to tariff-related headlines, Cuggino emphasized the importance of not overreacting to daily news fluctuations. He described the market\u2019s behavior as herky-jerky and advised investors to focus on long-term opportunities rather than reacting impulsively. His base case anticipated some turbulence due to the transition under the new administration\u2019s economic policies. His strategy involves identifying opportunities during volatile periods rather than making significant portfolio changes.\n\nThe discussion also featured David Zervos, Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies, who provided insights on Washington\u2019s role in market volatility. Zervos acknowledged that while policies such as tariffs, immigration reforms, and drug policies were largely unfolding as expected, the speed of changes under the current administration was surprising investors. He pointed out rapid spending cuts and layoffs in the public sector as key contributors to market unease. For instance, courts recently ordered the federal government to rehire probationary employees who had been dismissed. Zervos likened this abrupt shift to transitioning from a public-sector-reliant economy to one driven by the private sector, which is a process that has introduced significant uncertainty. Regarding tariffs specifically, Zervos downplayed their overall impact on the US economy, which he described as domestically driven. While tariffs could affect specific industries like wine or automobiles with high overseas components, he argued that broader economic trends would be shaped by deregulation, reduced business costs, and a shift toward private-sector efficiency. He warned that the speed of these transitions could lead to short-term volatility but maintained optimism about long-term productivity gains.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top S&P 500 stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15.

Morgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigritzoglou last week. \"Indeed on our estimates, the implied probability of a U.S. recession embedded across asset classes continued to creep up over the past week as risk markets suffered losses and as U.S. Treasury yields decline.\"\n\nHowever, the JPMorgan analysts' review suggested that the correction may have been caused mainly by quantitative hedge funds that use algorithmic strategies to adjust positions, rather than concerns about a recession.\n\nCONSUMERS LOADING UP ON BOOZE AS TRUMP THREATENS MASSIVE TARIFF ON ALCOHOL FROM EU\n\n\"The recent U.S. equity market correction appears to be more driven by equity quant fund position adjustments and less driven by fundamental or discretionary managers reassessing U.S. recession risks,\" they wrote.\n\nThe report noted that credit markets are sending a less recessionary signal than equities and a bond benchmark.\n\nAs of March 11, the S&P 500 Index suggested a 33% implied probability of recession, while the 5-year Treasury implied a 46% chance, base metals 45% and the Russell 2000 Index a 52% chance.

Looking across investor types, retail investors are unlikely to be the culprits,\" the analysts wrote. \"As we highlighted in our recent publications, retail investors continued their 'buying the dip' behavior over the past three weeks.\"\n\n\"In our mind the most likely culprits are equity hedge funds and in particular two categories: Equity Quant hedge funds and Equity TMT Sector hedge funds,\" the analysts said. They went on to note that more traditional hedge funds focused on long or short equity positions played less of a role in the pullback given their equity beta, a financial metric, rising in February.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"If the above assessment is correct and equity quant hedge funds played more of a role than their discretionary counterparts, then the recent U.S. equity market correction would appear to be more driven by fundamental or discretionary managers reassessing U.S. recession risks,\" the analysts explained.\n\n\"And if U.S. equity ETFs continue to see mostly inflows as they have thus far, there is a good chance that most of the current U.S. equity market correction is behind us,\" they added.",

JPMorgan Chase & Co. et al., was filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs are Seth Stern, Angela Bindner and Marianne Schmitt. Defendants include the company, the bank, its U.S. benefits executive, the company board\u2019s compensation and management development committee, and Bernadette J. Branosky, Stephen B. Burke, Linda B. Bammann, Todd Combs and Virginia Rometty, all members of the board of directors.\n\nJPMorgan could not be reached Friday for comment.\n\nThe complaint claims the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by \u201cagreeing to grossly inflated prescription drug prices, costing the JPMorgan Plan and its participants/beneficiaries millions of dollars through higher payments for prescription drugs, higher premiums, higher out-of-pocket costs, higher costs, higher deductibles, higher coinsurance, higher copays and suppressed wages.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 filing states that the defendants\u2019 mismanagement led to the plan paying its pharmacy benefits manager\u2014CVS Caremark, which is not a defendant in the case\u2014too much for many generic drugs, which the complaint claims are widely available for less. In particular, the suit cites as an example the $6,229 price the plan\u2019s participants paid for a 30-unit supply of the drug teriflunomide (the generic version of the drug Aubagio). The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint states that the same supply of the same drug is available, without insurance, at retail and online pharmacies for prices between $32.96 and $11.05.\n\n\u201cNo prudent fiduciary would agree or allow for its plan and participants/beneficiaries [to] pay a price that is more than two hundred times higher than the price available\u201d at retail, the complaint states. The filing adds that the price disparities continue across all 366 generic drugs across the plan\u2019s formulary.\n\nThe case was filed after the Federal Trade Commission, in January, issued a second report in as many years, finding that the three big U.S. PBMs have marked up drug prices.\n\nThe FTC issued its first interim report in July 2024 and, a few months later, filed an administrative lawsuit against the \u201cbig three\u201d PBMs\u2014Caremark Rx, Express Scripts and Optum Rx\u2014and their affiliated group purchasing organizations.\n\nUnder the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, plan sponsors are required to attest that the fees they pay for health care plans are fair and reasonable. As a result, it is important that plan sponsors apply a fiduciary process when evaluating their health plans, including pharmacy benefit managers, as well as remain aware of any pending litigation involving the providers.\n\nThe ERISA Industry Committee called on Congress last September to deem PBMs as fiduciaries under ERISA, as they play a significant role in negotiating prescription drug costs for plan sponsors managing health plans. Congress has not yet taken any action on the issue.\n\nThe suit against JPMorgan states that the company pays CVS Caremark about $3 million annually in administrative fees, in addition to the fees that Caremark collects for prescriptions.\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking \u201cappropriate\u201d damages, to have the suit deemed a class action, and to have the defendants make the plan whole for all losses resulting from the claimed fiduciary breaches. They have also asked that an independent fiduciary be appointed to run the plan and that the PBM be replaced.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by the New York-based law firm Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll and Washington, D.C.-based Fairmark Partners.",

A property\u2019s past earnings are typically used to assess its potential value.\n\nWells Fargo claims that JPMorgan approved the overvalued property deal to reap millions of dollars in fees, thinking that the assets would eventually be dumped on investors who wouldn\u2019t realize the buildings were not as profitable as declared on paper.\n\nChetrit\u2019s loan turned sour in 2022 and, in the process, Wells Fargo says investors in the trust have lost tens of millions of dollars.\n\n\u201c[JPMorgan] had an obligation to engage in due inquiry to determine the scope of the fraudulent reporting. Instead, [JPMorgan] plowed ahead as if nothing unusual had happened without even bothering to correct known errors in the numbers.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo is asking the court to order JPMorgan to either pay for damages or repurchase the loan and make the investors whole.\n\nJPMorgan and Chetrit have not yet issued a statement regarding the case.\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In one week, beginning March 23, 2025, Chase will enforce a restriction on Zelle payments that it deems a social media scam.\n\nIf Zelle is an app you use frequently, read on to learn more about Chase's crackdown plans and how they may affect how you send or receive money from family and friends.\n\nRead more: Scamming the Scammers: Meet the Deepfake Granny, Digital Bots and YouTubers Fighting AI Fraud\n\nWhy Chase will be blocking Zelle social media charges\n\nZelle and other digital payment apps, such as Venmo and Cash App, make it easy for scammers to get your money, and many scammers target people on social media. According to Chase, nearly 50% of fraud reports it received from June 1, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2024, came from social media.\n\nA December 2024 lawsuit by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleged that customers at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo lost more than $870 million through Zelle payments since the app launched in 2017. While the CFPB recently dropped the suit, it still raised alarms that customers are at risk using the digital payment app. And since Zelle offers no purchase protection, once you've sent your money on the app, you're unlikely to get it back.\n\nWith its new policy, Chase hopes to stop fraud before it happens. Its updated Zelle Service Agreement will allow it to decline or block payments it believes originated on social media. The bank may also delay or hold payments so it can request information from you to authenticate the transaction, such as verifying your identity, the sender or recipient's identity and payment details.\n\nBest Digital Wallets and Payment Apps\n\nSee at Cnet\n\nOther ways Chase customers can send money safely\n\nIf you want to send or receive money through your Chase account, there are plenty of secure ways to do so. Chase partners with several other digital payment services, such as PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay and Paze.\n\nYou should never send money through a payment app to someone you don't know and trust. It also helps to know the signs of a scam so you can avoid falling into fraudsters' traps.",

Tamara Beckwith\n\nRoy Messer, a 57-year-old health insurance broker from Charlotte, and his business partner Bill Rice, also 57, said they were shocked by the penny-pinching from the bank run by Jamie Dimon and took matters into their own hands.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe for such an amount of money that they wouldn\u2019t want to do the right thing. There is no doubt that her husband would have wanted that money to go to her and his kids,\u201d Rice said.\n\n\u201cI imagine that for Jamie Dimon, this is like a nickel falling out of his pocket. I would like to believe that he just doesn\u2019t know (about this).\u201d\n\nMesser, who served in the Marine Corps between 1986 and 1989, said he was \u201ctouched\u201d by Silverberg\u2019s story and that wiring her the money was \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know her and I could have very easily just turned the page. But when something like that reaches out and grabs you, I looked at it and thought: \u2018What if that was my mother?'\u201d he told The Post.\n\nSilverberg was left stunned by their gesture, saying it \u201crestored my faith in mankind.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this crazy world we live in, it is remarkable that such kindness also exists. I am flabbergasted at their extreme generosity,\u201d she told The Post.\n\nMesser and Rice learned of Silverberg\u2019s ordeal after reading The Post\u2019s story in December. Courtesy of Roy Messer\n\nJPMorgan declined to comment, but a senior source inside the bank said the rules governing its pension fund ban any exceptions from being carved out.\n\nJPMorgan insiders told The Post in December that the company would never back down after Grinches at the bank denied Silverberg\u2019s repeated pleas to hand over her husband Mel\u2019s $331-a-month pension pot.\n\nAccording to Silverberg, a former government administrator, the fully vested cash pile is worth an estimated $53,000.\n\nJaime Dimon CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nBut JPMorgan bean counters said Mel, a former system analyst with Chase Manhattan Bank until 1979, failed to fill in the necessary forms before he unexpectedly died at the age of 43 from multiple organ failure in 1988.\n\nChase Manhattan went on to merge with JPMorgan in 2000. The Wall Street giant posted record profits of $58.5 billion last year, with Dimon raking in $39 million in compensation.\n\nThe Ronald Reagan administration passed the Retirement Equity Act in 1984 so spouses like Silverberg would automatically benefit if their loved ones died.\n\nThe late Mel Silverberg (left) with Elaine and two of their daughters in 1973. Provided to the NY Post\n\nJPMorgan insists it wrote to Mel on three separate occasions asking him to elect survivor coverage after he stepped down. His widow says none of that correspondence ever arrived at the family home.\n\nShe said pension managers can only dig up documentation that they say proves they contacted Mel in 1990 \u2014 two years after he died.\n\nSilverberg even once enlisted US Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and ex-Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY) of the Bronx to convince the firm to change its mind, to no avail.",

Its tech workforce of 63,000 employees, with a third of them based in India, represents about 21% of its global headcount.The efficiency gains from the coding assistant will also allow JPMorgan's engineers to devote more time to high-value projects focusing on artificial intelligence and data, Beer said.The bank already has about 450 potential cases for which it could use AI, and CEO Jamie Dimon expects those potential applications to surge to 1,000 by next year. The bank is focused on areas where it can use AI to make money for its businesses, Beer said.\"I wouldn't say success is if we get 1,000 done,\" she said. \"Success is if we continue to articulate that it's not just an incremental shift with AI, but we're transforming and creating value,\" she said.JPMorgan's president Daniel Pinto previously said implementing AI could add about $1 billion to $1.5 billion in value for the bank.In terms of hiring, \"we've sort of passed our high growth time\", Beer said.\"There's so much productivity and opportunity as we think about a world with AI. We've grown rapidly... You're going to see us continue to optimize the footprint we have,\" she said.In 2022, Beer said the company planned to hire about 2,000 engineers worldwide.

            "content": "JPMorgan Employees Share Concerns on Return to Office Policy in Private Chats\n\nAmid ongoing discussions about JPMorgan Chase's decision to mandate a full return to the office for its employees, tensions are rising among staff members who have taken to private Signal chats and Reddit threads to express their concerns. According to a report by Business Insider, these forums have become unofficial \"support groups\" for JPMorgan employees seeking clarity and support (source). The intricate dynamics at play within the company are pushing employees to look for any intel on the policies and measures the bank might employ to enforce this mandate.\n\nConcerns Over Surveillance and Productivity\n\nEmployees are particularly anxious about the tools being used to monitor their attendance and productivity, fearing inaccuracies that might affect their jobs. One notable concern is the possible introduction of tools that work as heat maps to surveil employee productivity on an hourly basis. Although a JPMorgan spokesperson confirmed the absence of such firmwide tools, the existence of color-coded calendars to track attendance patterns implies that surveillance mechanisms are in place.\n\nThe IndexBox platform further indicates that companies adopting similar full-time office mandates may face challenges, as heightened employee monitoring can affect overall workplace morale and productivity. As discussions within JPMorgan's private group chats suggest, the return-to-office policy has already aroused mixed reactions, with some employees feeling surveilled and undervalued.\n\nResponse and Adaptation\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has acknowledged that the policy could lead to employee attrition, a sentiment he communicated in a recent CNBC interview. However, the bank's upper management remains steadfast in their decision, citing the importance of in-office collaboration. Despite the pressure of adapting to these new expectations, some employees are also considering unionizing with assistance from the Communications Workers of America, seeking a structured response to perceived imbalances in policy and work-life expectations.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

            "content": "9h05 \u25aa 5 min read \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nElon Musk is facing an unprecedented storm. Tesla, his jewel, is plummeting on the stock market, losing nearly half of its market capitalization in just a few months. Between declining sales, tarnished brand image, and political turbulence, the situation is worrying analysts. According to JPMorgan, this drop is unprecedented in the history of the automotive industry. How did we get here?\n\nTesla in crisis: a loss of 48% in a few months\n\nTesla, already not doing very well in Europe, is in free fall. In less than six months, the company saw its valuation drop from $1.54 trillion to $777 billion. A real crash that can be explained by an explosive combination: declining global sales, strategic uncertainties, and controversies surrounding Elon Musk.\n\nJPMorgan claims to find no equivalent to such a disaster in automotive history.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves:\n\n49% decline in market capitalization over six months;\n\n355,000 deliveries expected for the first quarter of 202, which is 8% less than in 2024;\n\n45% drop in new orders in Europe in January.\n\nThis commercial disaster is compounded by a change in perception among consumers. Some Tesla dealerships have even reported customers attempting to hide their vehicle\u2019s logo. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, remains optimistic:\n\n\u201cYou have to see Elon as our Einstein. His innovations are disruptive, but the market demands concrete results.\u201d\n\nWill Tesla manage to turn things around before it\u2019s too late?\n\nAn unforgiving stock market facing Musk\u2019s strategy\n\nIf Tesla is plummeting on the stock market, it\u2019s not just due to weak sales. Investors are increasingly worried about Musk\u2019s strategic decisions, accused of scattering his focus across his various projects, notably SpaceX and X. His involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Trump adds a political dimension that is both disturbing and intriguing.\n\nAnalysts point to three major risks:\n\nThe impact of Musk\u2019s political choices on Tesla\u2019s perception;\n\nThe likely reduction of tax credits for electric cars;\n\nInternal management issues due to the CEO\u2019s scattering of focus.\n\nSome observers wonder if Musk still has control over his empire. Others think that the situation could turn in his favor, especially with the upcoming launches of the Tesla robotaxi and the Optimus robot. Wall Street, however, remains skeptical.\n\nDoes the market still trust Musk, or is it turning the page?\n\nTrump and Tesla: a controversial alliance\n\nThe shadow of Donald Trump looms over Tesla. Initially seen as an asset, the proximity between Musk and the former president has become a topic of division. Analysts at JPMorgan note that Musk\u2019s commitment within the government could harm Tesla more than it helps.\n\nIn the United States, protests targeted Tesla dealerships, with some being vandalized. Trump responded by announcing that the perpetrators would be treated as domestic terrorists.\n\nBut the economic reality is just as delicate. Tesla could be the first victim of the end of federal subsidies for electric vehicles, a measure heavily supported by Trump. If these aids disappear, Tesla will lose a crucial lever to attract new buyers.\n\nDoes Trump really want to support Musk, or is he just trying to strengthen his influence over the automotive industry? One thing is certain: the future of Tesla is today as uncertain as the American political landscape.\n\nDespite this dizzying drop, Tesla retains an asset: its bitcoin holdings. The company could have maximized its profits if it had held onto its BTC, but it still realized $600 million in gains in the fourth quarter of 2024. Proof that, even in the midst of the storm, Musk still knows how to play a few winning moves.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWomen in recent years have expanded their participation in the global workforce beyond pre-pandemic levels but, based on the current rate of progress, will probably not reach gender parity with men for 134 years, JPMorgan Chase said in a study.\n\nWhile women are achieving homeownership at more than twice the rate of men, employed women in the U.S. last year earned only 83 cents for every dollar men earned, JPMorgan Chase said, citing Payscale data that does not account for such factors as job, experience or education.\n\n\u201cThe persistent gender pay gap is a stark reminder of the systemic inequalities that still exist and the need for ongoing efforts to achieve pay equity,\u201d JPMorgan Chase said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWomen worldwide are far from attaining equal status in the C-suite, holding only about 10% of the most powerful roles such as CEO, CFO and COO, JPMorgan Chase said.\n\nAlthough the share of women directors among Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 companies rose last year to a record 34%, progress in U.S. board representation slowed in recent years, JPMorgan Chase said.\n\nFor example, within the Standard & Poor\u2019s 100 companies, the percentage of women in the C-suite declined in 2023 to 11.8% from 12.2% in 2022, JPMorgan Chase said.\n\nAmong 146 countries, the global gender gap in 2024 persisted at 68.5%, measuring women\u2019s political and economic participation, health and educational attainment compared with men, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nClosing the gender gap globally by 2030 will require annual investment of $360 billion, JPMorgan Chase said, citing U.N. estimates.\n\nBased on current trends, women worldwide will not attain global gender equality until next century, which means \u201ca girl born today would have to wait until her 97th birthday \u2014 which is beyond the expected lifespan in every country \u2014 to experience a truly equal society,\u201d JPMorgan Chase said.\n\nYet some trends are favorable, according to JPMorgan Chase. \u201cPrime-age female labor force participation rates have risen to 65.7%, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, and the number of women in the U.S. job market has reached a historic high.\u201d\n\nAlso, women are making \u201csignificant strides\u201d in homeownership, JPMorgan Chase said. Single women are buying homes at more than double the pace of single men despite higher rates of rejection in mortgage applications, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nBank of America Securities suggests in a research report that women during the coming decade will gain the wherewithal for greater shareholder clout.\n\nSo-called Baby Boomer U.S. men born between 1946 and 1964 will pass on $30 trillion in wealth to their wives and children by 2035, according to Bank of America.\n\n\u201cThis wealth is already being passed down, and it will soon mean that women control more money than ever before,\u201d Bank of America said.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not all: Women now outnumber men at university\u201d and work and spend more than in previous years, Bank of America said. Also, \u201cthey have strong career aspirations and expect higher pay.\u201d",

JUSA offers a distinctive approach to U.S. equity exposure by utilizing proprietary research and concentrating on well-established, large-cap U.S. companies.\n\nThe fund is managed by seasoned portfolio managers Ralph Zingone and Tim Snyder, who bring extensive expertise in managing research enhanced strategies. The investment team has been implementing the underlying strategy since 1988, demonstrating a long-standing dedication to achieving consistent returns.

            "content": "However, besides technology, there are some business models that also allow for strong profitability and cash flow. First, there are energy leaders who are literal cash cows and generate tens of billions of dollars annually from energy operations, which are vital to the world economy and are unlikely to be disrupted anytime soon. Second, there is the financial sector, and particularly banks, which are considered the blood of the world economy \u2013 by intermediating operations worth trillions of dollars annually, the leading banks can capture a tiny share of those transactions, which overall results in giant amounts of net profit. Last but not least, some of the most profitable companies in the world can be found even in more competitive sectors like consumer discretionary.\n\nIn the last decade, the most profitable large cap stocks have mostly clustered in the technology sector, leveraging such factors as the giant global total addressable market and wide margins allowed by the technological advantage. Furthermore, some of these companies took the center of the stage during 2023-2024, a time when the AI megatrend opened a new growth frontier and led to rising stock market concentration; in other words, the most profitable companies became even more profitable. This trend has resulted in a widening gap between the leading tech giants and other sectors, as investors increasingly flock to these high-growth stocks, anticipating continued dominance and innovation.\n\nThe most profitable large-cap stocks, in terms of absolute net profit, are typically concentrated in industries with relatively high barriers to entry and substantial global demand. These include sectors like technology, healthcare, energy and consumer goods, where leaders can benefit from strong market positions, innovation and economies of scale. Furthermore, strong profitability usually translates very well into cash flow, which gives a lot of flexibility with capital allocation \u2013 the companies can either reinvest in growth during favorable times or support the stock price through repurchases when the market is less favorable. Consequently, the advantages of investing in such companies include stability, the potential for consistent revenue growth, and resilience during economic downturns.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Most Profitable Large Cap Stocks to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against other most profitable large cap stocks to buy now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe believe that the most profitable companies can enter the spotlight again at a time when the US and global economy are at an important crossroads. Not only are these companies immune to tariffs and less sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, interest rates, and consumer health, but they also generate tens of billions of dollars in free cash flow every year, which gives them flexibility to adjust to a new regime. Investor sentiment has shifted to a pronounced bearish, as the US stock market officially entered correction mode, with more than a 10% contraction since the February peak. It appears that the fears of Trump tariffs staying for the long-term, as well as the negative impact on GDP growth from major cuts in public funding, are finally hitting the markets. Going forward, as smaller-cap stocks are pressured by uncertainty and deteriorating consumer confidence, profitable large caps can become safe havens and attract capital. The key takeaway for investors is that if one wants to stay invested in the US equity market amid the current turbulent times, they\u2019re better off sticking to the widest moat and most profitable names out there.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of most profitable large cap stocks, we searched for the publicly traded companies with the largest amount of net income generated in the latest financial year and ranked them accordingly. For each company we also include the number of hedge funds that own the stock, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) the Most Profitable Large Cap Stock to Buy Now?\n\nA group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 123\n\nLast year net income: $56.87 billion\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a global financial services company offering banking, investment, and asset management solutions. It operates through four main segments: Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Banking, Commercial Banking, and Asset & Wealth Management. The company provides services such as retail and commercial banking, investment banking, securities trading, and financial advisory. JPM serves individuals, businesses, and institutions worldwide, managing assets across various financial markets. It plays a key role in global finance through lending, capital markets, and wealth management solutions. The company ranked 5th on our recent list of 10 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock in 2025.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) demonstrated strong performance across multiple business segments, with Investment Banking fees projected to be up mid-teens YoY and markets revenue expected to be up low double digits as of 2025. The bank has made significant progress in technology modernization, with 65% of applications running significant workloads in the cloud and 95% of applications either moved to strategic data centers or operating on the cloud. The technology investment continues to grow, with spending expected to increase from just under $17 billion in 2024 to approximately $18 billion in 2025. The bank has successfully integrated the Commercial Bank and Investment Bank operations, creating synergies and removing organizational seams to better serve clients across segments.\n\nIn terms of AI implementation, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has deployed over 450 use cases across various functions including risk management, payment processing, trade optimization, and customer service, with more than 200,000 employees now having access to their proprietary GenAI platform, LLM Suite. The bank maintains a strong international growth focus while also seeing significant domestic opportunities, particularly in middle market business and retail branch expansion in major markets like Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and Boston, where they are not yet among the top three players. With more than $56 billion net income in the latest fiscal year, JPM is one of the most profitable large cap stocks to buy now.\n\nOverall, JPM ranks 5th on our list of most profitable large cap stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of JPM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JPM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

Morgan\u201d) have an actual or perceived economic or other incentive in its management of our clients\u2019 portfolios to act in a way that benefits J.P. Morgan. Conflicts will result, for example (to the extent the following activities are permitted in your account): (1) when J.P. Morgan invests in an investment product, such as a mutual fund, structured product, separately managed account or hedge fund issued or managed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or an affiliate, such as J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.; (2) when a J.P. Morgan entity obtains services, including trade execution and trade clearing, from an affiliate; (3) when J.P.

Single women are buying homes at more than double the pace of single men despite higher rates of rejection in mortgage applications, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nBank of America Securities suggests in a research report that women during the coming decade will gain the wherewithal for greater shareholder clout.\n\nSo-called Baby Boomer U.S. men born between 1946 and 1964 will pass on $30 trillion in wealth to their wives and children by 2035, according to Bank of America.\n\n\u201cThis wealth is already being passed down, and it will soon mean that women control more money than ever before,\u201d Bank of America said.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not all: Women now outnumber men at university,\u201d and work and spend more than in previous years, Bank of America said. Also, \u201cthey have strong career aspirations and expect higher pay.\u201d",

            "content": "Recession fears aren't the reason stocks have tumbled in recent week, JPMorgan said.\n\nInstead, the bank blames data showing equity quant funds reducing their positions.\n\nCredit markets, meanwhile, aren't yet taking the stock market's recession fears seriously.\n\nRecession angst is roiling Wall Street as investors worry President Trump's trade war will be a hit to growth, but that's not why markets keep plunging. In JPMorgan's view, there's an under-the-radar reason the market is struggling.\n\nThe bank said in a note this week that a corner of the hedge fund sector might be to blame for the recent weakness, rather than investors repricing the risk of a recession in 2025. What's more, analysts added that the weekslong sell-off may be waning.\n\n\"The recent US equity market correction appears to be more driven by equity quant fund position adjustments and less driven by fundamental or discretionary managers reassessing US recession risks,\" according to a team of strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou.\n\n\"In our mind the most likely culprits are equity hedge funds and in particular two categories: Equity Quant hedge funds and Equity TMT Sector hedge funds.\"\n\nThe note follows weeks of seismic moves in equity markets, with major indexes now hovering in correction territory. The benchmark S&P 500 is down 9.7% from its late February high.\n\nBlame has chiefly fallen on deteriorating macroeconomic conditions as weakening data points and trade war threats have sent volatility soaring.\n\nJPMorgan also spotted this trend, noting that recession implications were creeping up across asset classes. But while equity and rate markets indicated recession odds as high as 50%, credit markets are pricing in remarkably lower chances.\n\n\"This divergence has been a phenomenon for most of the previous two years with multiple occasions when rate markets or equity markets priced in a high probability of US recession, while credit markets were much less concerned. At the end it was credit markets that were proven right as no recession took place,\" the bank said.\n\nInstead, provisional data implied that the two types of hedge funds were reducing positions. Meanwhile, retail investors have continued to buy the dip, with only one day of outflows from US ETFs has been seen since the stock market's peak on February 19.\n\n\"If US equity ETFs continue to see mostly inflows as they have thus far, there is a good chance that most of the current US equity market correction is behind us,\" Panigirtzoglou wrote.\n\nThe bank's prediction is still being tested. New tariff threats from President Donald Trump weighed on the market for the third day this week. As of 1:04 p.m. ET on Thursday, the S&P and Nasdaq Composite were 1.10% and 1.68% respectively.\n\nStill, others also suggest that recession fears might be overblown. Wells Fargo's head of equity strategy said the risk as a long-shot, telling CNBC that tariff noise likely won't be an issue in a year.\n\nEarlier this week, Morgan Stanley pointed out that the stock correction might stall around the 5,500 level for the S&P 500, less than 0.5% from where the index was trading Thursday afternoon.",

Prior to that, she spent 17 years at JPMorgan Chase in numerous roles, including head of technology, CTO and application development director.\n\nBlair will be based out of Wells Fargo\u2019s new technology hub in Columbus, Ohio, and report to Kerrins. \u201cHeather has tremendous technical depth and expertise in branch and ATM channels spending nearly two decades at JPMorgan,\u201d Wells said in an email.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWells Fargo is midway through a decade-long modernization push that\u2019s brought several key technology leadership changes over the last several years. Technology infrastructure modernization is ongoing at the bank, which earmarked $900 million for incremental technology investments this year, CFO Mike Santomassimo said in a January earnings call.\n\n\u201cWe continue to invest in technology and digital platforms to transform how we serve both our consumer and commercial customers,\u201d Santomassimo said. \u201cThis includes continuing the transition of our applications to the cloud, migrating into new data centers and investing in data platforms to drive more insights.\u201d\n\nBlair is the latest technology executive Wells has hired to help drive modernization efforts across its banking businesses.\n\nLast year, the bank welcomed Bridget Engle as head of technology. Engle previously served as CIO and head of engineering at BNY for seven years and as a CIO and CTO at Bank of America for six. Wells Fargo elevated Kerrins from within to lead the bank\u2019s generative artificial intelligence strategy concurrently.\n\n\u201cOur new generative AI team will work closely with our data and technology platform management teams, as well as each business, on identifying and delivering on the potential of generative AI responsibly,\u201d Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said in a July announcement.\n\nKerrins rose to head of technology as part of a C-suite reshuffle that elevated Saul Van Beurden to CEO of consumer and small-business banking in 2023. Van Beurden is a JPMorgan Chase veteran who served for five years as the company\u2019s CIO of consumer and community banking.\n\nAt the Columbus hub, Blair joins another former JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo CIO of Core Banking Technology Alan Varrasso, who was onboarded in 2022. The two executives\u2019 time at JPMorgan Chase overlapped for 10 years.\n\n\u201cHaving had the opportunity to work with Heather in the past, I\u2019ve seen firsthand her leadership, vision, and impact,\u201d Varrasso said on LinkedIn. \u201cShe brings a wealth of experience to the organization and more importantly is a true champion for female technology talent.\u201d",

Between Musk's love affair with Vladimir Putin and subsequent alienation of Ukraine, his anti-NATO posturing, and of course his support for \"far-right political parties\" \u2014 Brinkman's words, not ours \u2013 Tesla's new vehicle registrations in January were down 50 percent from the same period in 2024.\n\nThough there have been other massive value drops for Japanese and Korean car companies over \"diplomatic disputes\" with China, the analysts suggested that things are worse for Tesla because it's an international company that's \"not specific to any one nation or geography,\" BI wrote of the JPMorgan note.\n\nNotably, this analysis comes after Morgan Stanley suggested that Tesla shares are still worth buying and could rebound up to 90 percent, highlighting the shifting goalposts placed upon the Musk-owned company by its boosters.\n\nThen again, maybe it's not exactly a surprise that JPMorgan specifically is bearish on Tesla given that it was, until recently, suing the company over some stocks it sold to the institution a decade prior.\n\nMore on Tesla: One of Tesla's Biggest Supporters Is Running Out of Patience",

            "content": "Good morning, everybody. This is Michael Cembalest with a mid-March Eye on the Market podcast this month called 50 Days of Grey because what\u2019s been going on in the markets does feel a little sadomasochistic in terms of the administration policies. Recording this podcast from Vegas. This is actually my first trip here. I\u2019m not really a Vegas kind of person.\n\nFor people that know me, that is consistent. I\u2019m in the Wynn Hotel, and I\u2019m looking out at Treasure Island and the mountains, and whatever else happens here. I wanted to record a podcast in conjunction with this Eye on the Market that we sent out today because of what\u2019s going on, and how unique and unorthodox this all is for markets and for investors.\n\nSo I want to start with this, these pictures again, that I\u2019ve been using this year to frame discussions about the administration policies, where it\u2019s a little bit of Calvin Coolidge and small government and pro-business, and a little bit of James Polk and Manifest Destiny. And whether it\u2019s Panama or Canada or Greenland, Andrew Jackson, Woodrow Wilson\u2019s isolationism, Nixon\u2019s Enemies List size, and powers, deportations and lower corporate tax rates, the one that we\u2019re going to focus on most days.\n\nMcKinley. McKinley was all about tariffs and protectionism, and for those of you that have read some recent Eye on the Markets, McKinley\u2019s tariffs didn\u2019t work out so well for him or for the Republican Party. In, in, in the 1890 midterm elections, the Republicans lost over 100 seats in the House once the inflationary consequences of those tariffs became felt.\n\nAnyway, the market reaction is pretty severe. And there\u2019s something interesting about markets that I wrote about this time: The stock market can\u2019t be indicted, arrested or deported. It can\u2019t be intimidated, threatened or bullied. It doesn\u2019t have a gender or, and ethnicity. It can\u2019t be fired or furloughed or defunded. It can\u2019t be primaried before the next midterms. It can't be seized, nationalized or invaded. And it\u2019s the ultimate voting machine. And it reflects prospects for earnings, growth, stability, liquidity, inflation, tech, taxation and predictable rule of law. And the market consensus earlier this year, which was clearly wrong, was that the administration would carefully and surgically balance its advertised inflationary, anti-growth policies of tariffs and deportations with a lot of pro-growth policies.\n\nThe problem for investors is they\u2019ve come storming out of the gates with a lot more of the former than the latter. And I, I did anticipate, as I wrote in the Outlook, in the Executive Summary, a 10 to 15% correction this year. The only surprise is that I didn\u2019t think it would happen before 50 days has even passed since the inauguration.\n\nSo, if we look at what\u2019s going on, we\u2019re, we\u2019re, we\u2019re close to that 10% level on the S&P, we\u2019re I think at a 20% correction, if you\u2019re looking at the Mag 7, it may take time before the pro-market policies of this administration, whether it\u2019s deregulation or infrastructure permitting, cajoling more foreign direct investment, which I think is a great thing.\n\nThe, the benefit, whatever DOGE spending cuts may take place, it\u2019s going to take time before those pro-market policies materialize. And with the prospect of some kind of universal tariff or reciprocal tariff still in the wings for April, you know, we have some more downside risk in the markets here. And I would, if I had to put a number on it, I would say another 5 to 7%.\n\nBy the time all of the tariff clarity becomes clear, now, when if you get to those 12 to 15% overall correction levels on the S&P, when and if that should happen, I would look at deploying some excess liquidity if people have some in portfolios, but you know, that\u2019ll take time to see when we get there.\n\nI could be convinced that the U.S. needs some kind of painful short-term adjustments to reduce chronic deficits of, of traded goods, right, and we\u2019re all aware of that. But it\u2019s really hard to have a lot of confidence in the way this is being rolled out, given the zigzagging nature of some of the policies. And given that this same administration at the same time has been spending time and energy on establishing a strategic crypto reserve, that\u2019s not a confidence builder with respect to their overall economic policies.\n\nin terms of valuations, where that the Mag 7 valuations and the valuations on the S&P 500, ex the Mag 7, have taken a hit. I wouldn\u2019t describe us as anywhere near kind of a severe bear market or cheap territory. We\u2019re getting closer to some of the lowest Mag 7 valuations we\u2019ve had in the last, you know, eight, seven or eight years, less so with respect to the rest of the market.\n\nBut I would be a little bit patient here. I, I did note the, the, the Department of Justice filed a 130-page report the other day arguing for another, they can\u2019t require it, the judge has to approve it, but arguing for Google divestitures of Android and things like that, and Chrome. And bans on default search engine payments and maybe even bans on future AI and other search acquisitions.\n\nSo that sentiment may be weighing on the Mag 7 stocks as well. So in terms of the, the tariffs themselves, there\u2019s a chart that we have in the piece that looks at the historical tariff rate and where we are right now. No matter how you cut the numbers we\u2019re getting, we\u2019re already at the high of the highest tariff rates of the last 50 years.\n\nSo the only question is, are we going to start approaching the tariff levels that existed in the \u201930s and \u201940s? And that\u2019s why, that\u2019s how we have to see what\u2019s going to happen on the 10% tax on critical imports globally. What\u2019s going to happen with the 25% tax on global autos? Will there be some kind of reciprocal tariff? Will it include VAT taxes or not? Will Trump put another 20% on China in advance of some potential Xi-Trump summit to have more negotiating leverage? So you know, we\u2019ve got this chart in here. I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of these charts. They\u2019re all approximations because it\u2019s complicated to figure out when some of these tariffs are overlapping with each other.\n\nBut we have a chart in here that, that\u2019s our best take on where each one of these tariffs incrementally brings the, has the average tariff rate on imports relative to where we\u2019ve been in history. You can see that here. The other thing we\u2019ve done is we\u2019re trying to have some discipline around how we analyze this, this administration, so we created a Trump Tracker.\n\nIt\u2019s online and it has a bunch of charts. I\u2019ve included four of them here in this deck and also in the Eye on the Market this week so you can get a sense of what we\u2019re tracking. And these four things are not great confidence builders for investors. It shows the ISM surveys of prices paid in both manufacturing and services are rising.\n\nIt shows medium- and long-term inflation expectations. Surveys are rising and are my favorite. My single favorite economic indicator is the ISM new orders, less inventory chart because that shows you how much demand is percolating, net of inventory accumulation, that\u2019s rolled over, and then small business capital spending plans have rolled over. So now that the business sector and other participants in the economy are digesting all of these policies, we\u2019re, we\u2019re starting to see some of the impacts in the, in the high-frequency data that we look at.\n\nTariffs for the auto industry would come at a difficult time because the growth, production and employment in autos have already been what was already weakening at the end of the Biden administration. And this would compound things, and you know, a history on the steel tariffs shows that most of the tariff increases end up being reflected in producer prices that are not somehow eaten magically by the exporting country.\n\nAnd we have some information on that in here as well. I did notice that yesterday Ontario applied some kind of export tax on electricity transfers to some northeastern U.S. states. And in response, Trump has now doubled the tariff on imported Canadian steel and aluminum from 25 to 50%. I, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a large economic impact because of the scope of those, of the dollar value of those imports, but it may have an outsized confidence and knock-on impact on investors who were just trying to feel their way through a really unprecedented period, the usual sort. Not everybody agrees, but the usual suspects, whether it\u2019s the IMF, the Yale Budget Lab and the Peterson Institute, all believe that these tariffs are going to result in a one-time hit to GDP and a one-time increase in inflation. You know, we\u2019ll obviously, we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. But the bottom line here is I don\u2019t think we\u2019re through the market repricing of these tariff risks. The consensus view that, that the administration would be balanced and strategic about how it was rolling out these policies, I think, has been mistaken. And, and when we\u2019re all trying to find our way through the fog from here.\n\nAt the same time that this tariff drama is playing out, the administration is also working on a reconciliation bill to avoid the double-whammy of having all the tax rates sunset higher to pre-2017 levels. Now, it\u2019s not easy to negotiate a reconciliation bill when you\u2019ve only got a four-seat lead in the House, which is the situation the GOP is in. Even with a lot of tight discipline around the caucus because you\u2019re, you know, threatening to primary people that don\u2019t, that don\u2019t support.\n\nSo I wanted to just give you a sense for what this budget reconciliation bill could look like.\n\nSo we have this giant chart with pluses and minuses, and I\u2019m just going to walk you through the main points here because I think it\u2019s interesting to understand what they\u2019re trying to accomplish. So the budget reconciliation bill would start out, step one, cut some spending, right, and it falls under these categories that, that don\u2019t mean very much, like energy and commerce.\n\nIt turns out that the vast majority of the energy and commerce spending cuts the administration might pursue are actually Medicaid cuts of somewhere between $6 to 700 billion, then add in about $330 billion of spending cuts on student loans and about $230 billion of food stamp cuts. That falls under agriculture. So then you've got around $1.5 trillion of spending cuts. Then you spend that and more by extending all the tax cuts. That costs for, a little over $4 trillion. So now you\u2019re deep in the hole again. So now you\u2019re going to do some tax hikes, and you\u2019re going to do some weird individual income tax hikes. You\u2019re going to end some SALT cap loopholes on very wealthy people, and then the biggest one is going to be from restructuring in the energy bill, as we wrote in the energy paper which came out recently, we think somewhere around two-thirds of the subsidies in the energy bill will be clawed back through this restructuring, mostly EV credits related to buying EVs and charging stations, but also a rollback of some of the IDC and PTC provisions for, for wind and solar. So that, that gets back, let\u2019s call it another trillion of tax hikes.\n\nBut then there\u2019s going to be roughly another several hundred billion of new tax rates. It\u2019s increasing the SALT cap, no income tax on tips and some manufacturing incentives, and then some kind of reduced tax on seniors. And then on top of all that, you put on about $300 billion of spending hikes on homeland security and defense.\n\nAt the end of the process, you expand the CBO, the deficit over 10 years by two-and-a-half to 3 trillion versus the CBO baseline, right, but nobody thought that baseline was realistic anyway, because it included the assumption that all the tax cuts were going to sunset back to pre- 2017 levels. Even Harris, you know, Harris\u2019s program didn\u2019t assume that either. So, but this, this would kind of lock in deficits of somewhere around three-and-a-half to four percent over the next few years, which is larger than I think a lot of investors may have been expecting, and on the margin could put some upward pressure on interest rates.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to talk about in this podcast was about NATO, and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever thought about it enough to make a judgment, but I always just assumed that if Russia attacked a NATO country, whether it was one of the Eastern European countries like Bulgaria, Romania or, or even one of the Baltics that has large Russian populations, I always thought that there would be an immediate and vigorous response by NATO militarily, including substantial participation of the United States. And again, I, I, I\u2019m not saying, I\u2019m not making value judgment, I\u2019m just saying I always assumed that hair trigger was in place. And within the first 50 days of this new administration, I think that scenario may, may be gone. And some of the military people that I\u2019ve talked to believe that Trump has effectively, at least for now, driven a stake through the heart of NATO and that the U.S. would not participate in any kind of military defense of a NATO country. Even if the U.S. remains in NATO, supporting other countries when they\u2019re attacked is voluntary, not mandatory, according to Article Five of the NATO laws. So I think that, that that may have changed, and just in 50 days, like the, in throughout my entire 60-year, 62-year life, that, that assumption about how NATO functions in the world may have been upended. And, you know, NATO was a\u2014so what is\u2014NATO is a defense organization in which most members share common values.\n\nWe have a chart in the Eye on the Market at the end of this week\u2019s piece that shows the common Western Values Index of NATO countries: judicial independence, freedom of the press, separation of powers, judicial system, fairness, freedom of religion, expressive expression, movement, liberty, limited military involvement in government affairs. And that\u2019s what at least initially joined a lot of these NATO countries together, and but that\u2019s what now appears to be fractured. And so it\u2019s hard to say exactly how this will play out. I think there are some really important implications for cross-border investment, migration, portfolio flows, and trade and other things that I\u2019m still thinking through, but as it relates to the specific military consequences and implications of, of, of a, of a NATO that essentially disappears, we do walk through some of those prospects in, at the end of this week\u2019s Eye on the Market.\n\nSo take a look if you want to read in more detail. That\u2019s it for now. And we\u2019ll keep in touch as market situations evolve. Thank you. Bye.",

We did it to see if they'd be effective. They're highly effective. They work from home. They're mostly minorities. That's why we did it. It's a home run.

The outlook for deliveries and pricing looks difficult for the electric vehicle maker, Brinkman said, as CEO Elon Musk's controversial political activities have sparked a wave of criticism . This comes on top of a slow start to 2025, per the analyst. Brinkman now sees Tesla's first-quarter sales coming in at about 355,000, down from an earlier estimate of 444,000. That reflects an 8% decline year over year and a 28% plunge on a quarterly basis. Potential new buyers have staged boycotts of the brand in recent weeks. There have also been reports of vandalism and arson attacks across Tesla vehicles, dealerships and charging stations, according to NBC News . \"We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,\" Brinkman wrote in a note on Wednesday. While he noted that a similar example would be the boycott of Japanese and Korean vehicles in China during tense foreign relations in 2012 and 2017, respectively, \"the damage in that case was confined to a single market, whereas the decline in Tesla sales in 2025 is not specific to any one nation or geography.\" Tesla shares are down more than 5% week to date.

(HYMTF0.00% ) took a major hit in 2017 after Chinese citizens boycotted to protest over South Korea\u2019s decision to deploy a U.S. missile defense system. Korean brand sales have never fully recovered, JPMorgan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToyota Motor Co. (TM+1.65% ) and Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY+1.63% ), among others, slashed production in China after anti-Japan protests over disputed territory closed dealerships and slammed sales. Those automakers recovered after about a year of pain, and their biggest issues in China are now competing with domestic innovation.\n\nBut there\u2019s a big difference between the backlash Tesla is currently facing and those two instances \u2014 Tesla\u2019s is international.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeaceful protests have been organized at Tesla showrooms and facilities across the U.S. to protest Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has become a major figure in President Donald Trump\u2019s government. In an interview earlier this week, Musk told Fox Business (FOXA+1.66% ) that he has been running his businesses with \u201cgreat difficulty\u201d as he focuses on the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nBut more than a dozen violent or destructive acts have also been directed at the company\u2019s facilities since late January, according to The Washington Post, including one instance where an individual planted a Molotov cocktail near a vehicle. There have also been several reports of individual vehicles or Superchargers being vandalized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn France, a dozen Teslas were set on fire near the city of Toulouse, France24 reported. And in Berlin, fires broke out at a construction site for the expansion of a Tesla factory.\n\nThe research and consulting firm Brand Finance estimated Tesla\u2019s brand stood at $43 billion in October 2024, down $66.2 billion at the start of 2023, a few months after Musk began openly supporting Trump\u2019s re-election efforts. He spent about $288 million on the 2024 election, making him the largest donor of the cycle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla\u2019s sales across Europe \u2014 including Norway and Germany \u2014 have sunk over the past few months, partially due to Musk\u2019s political activities. In February, Tesla\u2019s Chinese shipments plunged 49% to 30,688 units, its lowest monthly figure since July 2022. In California, traditionally Tesla\u2019s biggest domestic market, sales have dropped for five straight quarters.\n\n\u201cWhile the effect on Tesla sales may have been more minimal in the past, and hence more difficult to tease out from other factors such as rising competition, it appears to have grown more acute since Mr. Musk stepped into a more divisive new role in government,\u201d the JPMorgan analysts said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJPMorgan estimates 355,000 deliveries for the first quarter, down from a prior forecast of 444,000 units and Bloomberg\u2019s consensus for 418,000 deliveries. The analysts expect full-year deliveries of 1.77 million, or a 1% decline year-over-year, down from their prior estimate of 1.99 million sales.\n\nUBS (UBS+2.43% ) analyst Joseph Spak on Monday lowered his first-quarter delivery target to 367,000 vehicles from 437,000 vehicles, noting that his team believes orders are somewhat muted. Baird analysts now expect 369,400 deliveries for the first quarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla\u2019s stock has also taken hits over the past few months, although shares rebounded 8% on Wednesday.

Tesla was the only EV company to see its stock surge after the president's electoral victory in November.

Trump has rushed to Tesla's defense and said he'd consider labeling the perpetrators domestic terrorists.\n\nOutside brand reputation, some analysts are also concerned that Musk's focus on political affairs is again distracting the CEO from his core businesses.\n\n\"After all, the simultaneous decline in both Tesla pricing and unit volume expectations did coincide with his takeover of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter,\" JPMorgan analysts pointed out.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note on Monday that Tesla shares had fallen because of \"sales data, negative brand sentiment, and market de-grossing\" but that they still saw a buying opportunity for the company.\n\n\"Today, with the stock down 50%, our investor conversations are focused on management distraction, brand degradation, and lost auto sales,\" analysts said.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nDespite the company's losses, Tesla remains the most valuable car company in the world.\n\nSecond to Tesla is the legacy automaker Toyota, which has a $292 billion market cap.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts noted several \"catalysts\" in the company's pipeline, including Tesla's robotaxi, expected to hit Austin roads later this summer, and another demonstration of Optimus, the humanoid robot anticipated before the end of the year.\n\nBut expectations for Tesla's delivery timelines may have to be tempered, given that the CEO has a history of missing his own deadlines.",

But it doled out the debt anyway.\n\nThe suit \u2014 first reported by Reuters \u2014 also alleges that the Chetrit Group was aware that the numbers had been fudged by the seller Roco Real Estate.\n\nRoco and the 43-property deal have been central to a widening federal investigation into mortgage fraud. In 2023, Roco principal Tyler Ross pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to commit an offense against the United States related to a previous financing of the properties. He was sentenced to a year in federal prison in September.\n\nThe Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency have uncovered that in multiple deals, operators routinely manipulated property financials such as expenses to obtain larger loans from lenders than they would have otherwise secured.\n\nSo far, at least six real estate operators across the U.S. have pleaded guilty. The investigation is ongoing.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s filing marks the first major lawsuit against a lender in the broader commercial mortgage fraud scandal. Lenders have largely claimed to be victims of borrowers\u2019 fraud.\n\nJPMorgan declined to comment on the lawsuit, as did an attorney for Wells Fargo.\n\nChetrit, through a spokesperson, pointed the finger at Roco, calling itself \u201ca victim of seller fraud, which was investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinancial misrepresentations were made by the seller that we unknowingly relied upon when we purchased the property,\u201d said a Chetrit representative in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe suffered great financial loss due to the seller\u2019s fraud,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAs a result of the fraud, the seller was convicted.\u201d\n\nThe saga dates back to 2019 when Chetrit was shopping for debt to buy Roco\u2019s apartment deal. Through due diligence, it allegedly found Roco had falsified trailing 12 month financial statements, notably inflating net operating income by 25 percent.\n\nChetrit found $3.5 million in reported income did not exist and $2.6 million in repair costs and expenses were missing, according to the lawsuit. It allegedly flagged the errors to Roco and the seller fessed up to the flubs, agreeing to slash the sale price by over $65 million.",

Though the return-to-office (RTO) policy was met with some internal opposition (more than 1,900 workers signed a petition calling for a hybrid work schedule), JPMorgan pushed ahead.\n\nNow, CEO Jamie Dimon says that when it comes to returning to the office, the only group of people disgruntled with the move are \"the people in the middle,\" like corporate office workers. Dimon said that the majority of workers in the U.S., or 60% of the workforce, have jobs that require them to show up in person, a statistic cited by Pew Research.\n\n\"You got UPS and FedEx and manufacturers and agriculture and hospitals and cities and schools and nurses and sanitation and firemen and military\" all working in person, Dimon said in a recent interview with the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \"It's only these people in the middle who complain a lot about it.\"\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Regrets Cursing at Company Town Hall But Stands By Return-to-Office Mandate: 'We're Not Going to Change'\n\nDimon noted that the benefits of in-person office conversations will help younger people succeed in their careers.\n\n\"All day long we're talking,\" he said. \"Constant updates, constant share of information.\"\n\nRemote work means young people miss out on these conversations, essentially \"leaving them behind,\" Dimon said. \"I won't do that.\"\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.

The bank runs virtual call centers in Baltimore and Detroit that collectively employ more than 100 remote workers.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, 60% of JPMorgan staff, including managing directors and salespeople, were already at the office five days per week.

President Donald Trump announced additional tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports. Ontario Premier Doug Ford then threatened to shut off electricity to the U.S. in response. The U.S. agreed to resume military aid shipments to Ukraine after Kyiv backed a 30-day ceasefire. All this comes as investors brace for the latest consumer price index release, due Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET.

Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have grown 0.3% month over month and 3.2% year on year. Against that backdrop, the JPMorgan trading desk laid out how it expects the market to react to CPI, based on five different scenarios: 5% chance \u2014 Core CPI rises 0.33% or more: The S & P 500 would drop 1.5% to 2.5% under this outcome, according to the traders. \"The first tail risk, which could show inflation accelerating higher after last month's 0.45%. Even the best case in this scenario is still a print that would be the second strongest since March 2024,\" they said. 25% chance \u2014 Core CPI rises between 0.28% and 0.32%: The trading desk said this print would add to a \"stagflationary narrative\" despite it marking a decline in month-over-month core prices. The S & P 500 would fall 1% to 1.5% under this scenario. 40% likelihood \u2014 Core CPI increased between 0.24% and 0.28%: JPMorgan traders called this possible outcome a \"welcome respite\" from higher inflation. Still, the potential market reaction ranges from a 0.5% decline to a 1% advance. 25% likelihood \u2014 Core inflation gains between 0.2% and 0.24%: This potentially benign print would lead to a 0.5% to 1.5% advance for the S & P 500, according to JPMorgan traders. 5% chance \u2014 Core CPI rises 0.19% or less: This is the \"second tail risk, which would come from a material dovish surprise from shelter prices and Core Goods moving towards increased deflation,\" JPMorgan traders said.

Conservatives have long alleged that banks were unfairly targeting them in the practice.\n\nAs part of the agreement, conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom has withdrawn a shareholder proposal brought by their client, Bowyer Research, calling for JPMorgan to issue a report on the risks associated \"related to religious discrimination against employees.\" In exchange, the bank has updated their Diversity & Inclusion section of their code of conduct to prohibit discrimination against \"religious views,\" and included language prohibiting discrimination against customers for their \"political opinions.\"\n\nJPMORGAN OFFICIAL DEFENDS BANK\u2019S DEI PROGRAMS, SAYS HIRING IS 'MERIT BASED'\n\n\"We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or inappropriate or abusive conduct by or against employees, customers, suppliers, contractors, or any other individuals who conduct business or seek to do business with our firm based on race, color, ethnicity, religion, religious affiliation, or religious views, national origin or ancestry, gender, military status, disability, marital or familial status, political opinions, speech or affiliations, age, or any status protected under applicable local law,\" the code of conduct now states.\n\n\"We regularly engage with our shareholders to address their feedback and educate them on our policies.

Sam Brownback claimed that the financial institution canceled the account for his nonprofit, the National Committee for Religious Freedom, shortly after he opened it in 2022.\n\n\"We went into a Chase branch in the District of Columbia to open an account. No problem. Then, several weeks later, I went to put another deposit in the account, and they said, 'Your account has been canceled, we'll be sending your money back to you,\u2019\" Brownback told Fox Business at the time.\n\nBrownback, who also served as governor of Kansas and ambassador-at-large for religious freedom during the first Trump administration, alleged that an employee at Chase offered to reopen his account, but only if he disclosed his donors and which political candidates his organization had plans to endorse in an oped in the Washington Times. The former ambassador told Fox News Digital that Chase\u2019s change in policy represents a \"big win.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m hopeful that Chase\u2019s willingness to adopt these new protections will play a big role in preventing future discrimination at the nation\u2019s largest bank. This is a big win, but we\u2019re far from finished,\" Brownback said.\n\nA representative for the bank denied all allegations of debanking in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"We have never and would never close an account for political or religious reasons, period.

Therefore, the sectorwide selling was likely due to comments made by President Donald Trump during an interview over the weekend.\n\nUncertainty over Trump's tariff policy has recently led to recession or stagflation fears; over the weekend, Trump declined to rule out tolerating a recession as a result of the protectionist policies.\n\nAs most know, recessions aren't positive for financial stocks. Thus, investors are de-risking ahead of possible economic turmoil today.\n\n\"What we're doing is very big\"\n\nFinancial stocks initially rallied upon Trump's election, likely due to the anticipation of deregulation and lower taxes.\n\nHowever, a recession is typically bad news for financial stocks. During recessions, people are laid off from work, causing higher defaults on loans, and consumers broadly pull back their spending, which harms card activity and therefore \"swipe fees\" collected by credit card companies such as American Express.\n\nOver the course of the past month, investors grew worried as several consumer sentiment readings fell sharply, projections of GDP growth fell, and jobs growth came in below expectations -- albeit still in positive territory.\n\nAt least some of that negativity has been due to fears over tariffs, specifically recent duties on some imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, which went into effect on March 4. While Trump delayed tariffs on certain goods covered under the 2020 USMCA trade deal with Mexico and Canada, even those exempted goods are expected to get tariffed on April 2.\n\nRecalling his first term, investors had likely thought that if the stock market sold off enough or if the economic numbers got bad enough, the president would give in somewhat on tariff-related protectionist policies. However, in an interview on Sunday with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo, Bartiromo asked Trump if he anticipated a recession this year. He responded:\n\nI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We are bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing. And there are always periods of -- it takes a little time.\n\nInvestors are apparently taking these words to mean that Trump is willing to tolerate a recession this time in order to implement his tariff policies, with the goal of reshoring America's manufacturing base. Therefore, economically sensitive stocks are selling off. Unfortunately, these three financial stocks are in that camp.\n\nBut this sell-off could be an opportunity\n\nSignificant tariffs on imported goods, especially from America's neighbors, haven't really been implemented significantly in the past. So, there is a high amount of uncertainty as to the effects. This is why there has been such a big sell-off.\n\nHowever, it's possible things are getting way too pessimistic, as the economy isn't in a recession now. Jobs are still growing, even at a slower pace than before. There also aren't many economists who predict a recession as their base case for the economy looking forward. Moreover, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell gave a fairly encouraging take on the economy and inflation last Friday. That being said, he declined to offer an opinion on the back-and-forth policy on tariffs, but said the Federal Reserve would react appropriately when they are implemented based on how the economy reacts.\n\nDuring times of uncertainty, markets tend to react quite harshly. However, for those with a long-term perspective, these types of sell-offs can prove to be excellent buying opportunities in quality companies.\n\nWhether or not today's action represents such an opportunity is hard to say. However, it may be time to get out your shopping list. If the U.S. economy is able to weather tariffs without a big recession, it seems like it's probably a better time to be buying quality stocks at their current discounts than selling them.",

CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nThe group proactively defends the constitutional freedom of religion so that all Americans can peaceably live according to their faith. Our advisory board includes Jewish, Hindu, Muslim and Christian leaders from a wide variety of mainstream denominations.\n\nYet when I tried to deposit a donation at a local Chase branch, I was informed the bank had closed our account \u2014 without giving me any reason why.\n\nThe following week, we received an official letter stating that we were no longer Chase customers.\n\nOver the course of the next year, a stream of Chase employees offered up no fewer than four conflicting explanations for why it had canceled our account.\n\nThe excuse-making culminated at the company\u2019s 2023 annual shareholder meeting, where CEO Jamie Dimon incorrectly claimed \u2014 for the first time \u2014 that we had failed to properly fill out our initial paperwork.\n\n3 Sam Brownback alleges that victims of having their bank accounts canceled were conservative or religious. CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nIt was the fifth and final justification for why his bank had canceled our account. What his rationale lacked in creativity it more than made up for in obstinance.\n\nBut I\u2019m the son of a Kansas farmer, so I\u2019m no stranger to dealing with stubbornness.\n\nBy the time of that annual meeting, NCRF had already launched a national campaign to collect and tell the stories of those who, like us, had been canceled or punished by their banks, payment processors or even insurance companies.\n\nWe found that most debanking victims have two things in common: Their finances are in order, and they\u2019re conservative or religious.\n\nWe also learned that even before NCRF opened its short-lived Chase account, the bank had already established a disturbing track record of targeting conservatives.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn Jr., two others closely associated with the first Trump administration, also faced debanking by Chase.\n\nIn both cases, the bank cited vague terms of service, including \u201cpossible reputational risk to our company,\u201d only to reverse course after swift public backlash.\n\nMeanwhile, other banks followed Chase\u2019s lead.\n\nMost notably, Bank of America canceled accounts of Christian ministries like Timothy Two Project International and Indigenous Advance Ministries, a charity that serves hurting widows and orphans in Uganda.\n\nIndigenous Advance\u2019s case was uniquely egregious, according to Alliance Defending Freedom, the legal organization that represented the group. In addition to closing the ministry\u2019s account, Bank of America shuttered the account of a local supporting church as well.\n\nThose of us raising the concern in the public square \u2014 which came to include then-candidate Donald Trump, whose wife and youngest son were also denied bank accounts \u2014 were laughed off by the likes of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which mocked our experiences as fictional.\n\nBut representatives at Chase began to take our concerns seriously.\n\n3 JPMorgan Chase, America\u2019s largest bank, abruptly canceled our newly opened account for the National Committee for Religious Freedom, writes Brownback. CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nWe notched our first victory in late 2023, when Chase\u2019s payment-processing arm WePay quietly dropped a \u201csocial risk\u201d policy that included subjective terms like \u201chate\u201d and \u201cintolerance.\u201d In practice, that allowed bank employees to cancel or punish customers based on their viewpoints.\n\nNow a true sea-change at Chase is on the horizon: In response to conversations with ADF attorneys and shareholders, Chase has agreed to adopt language in its corporate code of conduct to protect customers against any future instances of political and religious debanking.\n\nIt\u2019s the first major US bank to make such a course correction.\n\nThe new policy specifies that Chase will \u201cnot tolerate discrimination\u201d against customers, suppliers, contractors, employees or others affiliated with Chase \u201cbased on \u2026 religion, religious affiliation, or religious views \u2026 [or] political opinions, speech or affiliations.\u201d\n\nFor those of us who\u2019ve had the fiscal rug pulled out from under us, Chase\u2019s new commitments mark a crucial milestone in the fight against politicized debanking.\n\nBut the battle is far from over: Ending this discriminatory practice across the industry remains a long haul, requiring sustained pressure and vigilance.\n\nNo one should fear that their bank could punish them for their religious or political views \u2014 and we\u2019ll keep fighting until every American is free from that threat.\n\nSam Brownback, chairman of the National Committee for Religious Freedom, served as US ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom from 2018 to 2021.",

They all worked,\" he continued. \"It's only these people in the middle who complain a lot about it.\"\n\nWhite-collar workers, who generally have more freedom with where their work can be performed than frontline workers, have had various responses to return-to-office mandates in recent years.

It's a citizen's right,\" he previously told CNBC. \"But they should respect that the company is going to decide what's good for the clients, the company, etc., not an individual.\"\n\nDimon also said one reason he wanted people back in the office was that \"younger people are being left behind,\" adding: \"To have the younger people coming in but not their bosses \u2014 I have a problem with that too.\"\n\nJPMorgan Chase didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

But is that enough of a reason to buy the stock?\n\nConsidering that, at the moment, the market is pricing in what seems to be a perfect performance in the future, most investors will want to think twice before jumping in. Here's a look at the problem with JPMorgan Chase's stock today.\n\nWhat does JPMorgan Chase do?\n\nJPMorgan Chase is a finance company. That's the best way to describe it because its business touches on several important segments of the industry. For example, it owns a large bank that services consumers and businesses. It also operates an investment bank, which helps companies raise capital. And it operates a wealth management business, which handles the details of personal investing for wealthy clients. That basically touches on all of the big business lines in the finance industry with the exception of insurance.\n\nThe roughly $700 billion market cap financial giant has been performing pretty well of late. For example, in the final quarter of 2024, JPMorgan Chase's revenue rose 11% year over year. It increased earnings by 58%. And return on equity rose to 17% from 12% in the prior year. There is a reason why investors have been pushing the stock price up.\n\nAnd that's where things get interesting if you are looking at JPMorgan Chase today. The stock has pulled back a little from its recent highs, but it is still up nearly 28% over the past year. That's more than twice the gain of the S&P 500 index (^GSPC 1.61%). Investors are pricing in a lot of good news.\n\nJust how expensive is JPMorgan Chase?\n\nFor dividend investors, it is notable that JPMorgan Chase's roughly 2% dividend yield is near the low end of its 10-year range. That suggests a premium price tag today and should give income investors pause. However, dividend yield is a less common valuation tool.\n\nLooking at more common valuation metrics backs up the valuation concerns highlighted by the dividend yield. For example, JPMorgan Chase's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is currently sitting at around 4.25 times versus a five-year average of around 3.3 times. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is up around 12.5 times compared to a long-term average of roughly 11 times. And price-to-book value (P/B) is a bit above 2.1 times right now versus a five-year average of about 1.6 times.\n\nThe P/E ratio gap is the smallest of this group of valuation tools, suggesting only modest overvaluation. But the P/S and P/B ratios are both materially above their longer-term averages. And then you have to consider that the actual stock price is within 10% of its all-time highs at the time of this writing. This is most definitely not a stock that is on sale.\n\nNot a big enough pullback to buy JPMorgan Chase\n\nJPMorgan Chase's stock has pulled back some along with the broader market on economic concerns. But that drop isn't nearly enough to make the stock cheap if you look at traditional valuation tools or less traditional ones, like dividend yield. That doesn't mean JPMorgan Chase is a bad company, but even a good company can be a bad investment if you pay too much for it.",

Likes to mix things up by dipping into the world of American sports.\n\nFounded in 2016 by seven of the United States\u2019 largest banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, Zelle has become one of the most popular banking apps in the U.S. thanks to its simplicity, with money able to be transferred almost instantaneously by entering only a contact\u2019s mobile phone number or email address.\n\nMillions of users therefore were therefore hugely concerned by the news that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) had filed a lawsuit against Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo last December because of Zelle. The suit, however, has now been dropped.\n\nWe love an easy payment \ud83e\udd11 pic.twitter.com/sWs9EiMtat \u2014 Zelle (@Zelle) March 6, 2025\n\nThe reason Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were sued\n\nThe CFPB had accused the banks of failing to protect their customers from widespread fraud on the Zelle electronic payment system. The claim was that Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo customers had lost a substantial amount of money since Zelle\u2019s launch in 2017, had not been provided with any assistance and, in some cases, had even been told to \u201ccontact the scammers directly to recover their money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nation\u2019s largest banks felt threatened by competing payment apps, so they rushed to launch Zelle. By not implementing proper safeguards, Zelle became a goldmine for scammers, often leaving victims to fend for themselves,\u201d claimed CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, who was recently fired by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nCFPB drop Zelle lawsuit after Trump changes\n\nThe banks emphatically denied the allegations, calling them \u201clegally and factually flawed,\u201d and the CFPB dropped the suit at the beginning of March, without offering an explanation. Several other suits which were filed by the bureau under Chopra, including ones against Capital One, Rocket Homes and Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, have also been withdrawn.\n\nUnder new acting director Russell Vought, the CFPB has closed offices and attempted to fire hundreds of employees, a move that was blocked by a federal judge.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s return to the Oval Office in January, federal agencies have pulled back significantly on enforcement actions taken by the previous administration.\n\nHow safe is it to send money with Zelle?\n\nIn general, Zelle is considered a secure way to send money because transactions don\u2019t require you to share confidential financial information. Even so, it\u2019s a good idea to enable authentication and monitoring features to help ensure all payments are properly authorized.\n\nThat said, Zelle is best used for sending money to people you know and trust.\n\nRelated stories\n\nGet your game on!

The sale involved approximately 866,361 shares at around $269.83 per share through various family trusts and LLCs.\n\nDays later, Warren Buffett\u2018s Berkshire Hathaway BRK BRK announced a record $334 billion cash balance, suggesting potential caution about market valuations.\n\nOver the next 18 days following these moves, the Nasdaq 100 crashed 8.83%, with JPM stock falling over 9.63% in the same period.\n\nDimon\u2019s trades have historically served as leading market indicators.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks With At Least $20 Million In Insider Sales Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against the other stocks. We previously covered 10 stocks with at least $10 million in insider sales recently.\n\nThe turbulent week for the U.S. stock market continues, fueled by the Trump administration\u2019s shifting decisions on the start date for new tariffs. On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed executive actions that delay tariffs on all products from Mexico and Canada that are covered by the USMCA free trade treaty for nearly one month.\n\n\u201cAfter speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA),\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social Thursday.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that \u201cvirtually all\u201d of Mexico\u2019s trade with the U.S. falls under the USMCA, writes CNN Business.\n\nSo what happened with some of the major U.S. indexes? Blue-chip companies declined by 428 points or 0.99%, the broader market index lost 1.78%, while the NASDAQ entered correction, down 10.4% from its record high on December 16.\n\nMany analysts have recently revised their U.S. stock market predictions, suggesting that achieving strong earnings in 2025 may prove more difficult. Despite this, the broader market index is still expected to finish 2024 approximately 9% higher, although this is a decrease from the initial forecast of 12.2% made in January. Key drivers for this year include increased productivity from AI adoption and expectations of lower interest rates.\n\nAmid market fluctuations and uncertainty, insider trading often garners considerable attention. Executives and insiders, with deep insights into their companies\u2019 strategies and outlooks, may make trades worth examining. For example, when a CEO or CFO invests their own money in company stock, it can be a strong signal of confidence in the company\u2019s future prospects.\n\nOn the other hand, selling shares may suggest a lack of confidence from management, though this is not always the case. In some situations, large shareholders might be rebalancing their portfolios to better match their risk/reward preferences or selling for personal financial reasons. Additionally, many insiders sell shares as part of pre-arranged, automated trading plans, known as 10b5-1 plans.\n\nBoth insider buying and selling can be influenced by a range of factors, so these actions should be viewed in the context of the company\u2019s financial health, industry trends, and overall market conditions. This underscores the importance of conducting thorough research before making investment decisions. While insider trading activity can provide valuable insights into a company\u2019s future, it should be considered alongside other key factors to make well-informed investment choices.\n\nToday, we\u2019re focusing on stocks that have seen insider sales of at least $20 million since the start of the year. Using Insider Monkey\u2019s insider trading screener, we identified stocks where at least one insider sale reached $20 million or more. While the total value of insider sales for these stocks may be higher, we focused on sales worth $20 million or more. Out of the stocks that met this criterion, we selected the 10 stocks with insider sales ranging from $20 million to $30 million, prioritizing those with the highest insider sales within this range for further analysis.\n\nOur research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds, focusing on insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nFor each stock, we provide details on the highest individual sale, the number of insider sales exceeding $20 million year-to-date, and the company\u2019s current market capitalization. Let\u2019s take a look at 10 stocks with at least $20 million in insider sales since the beginning of the year.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

The company's revenue from general merchandise and marketing is expected to maintain rapid growth, supporting overall revenue and profit growth in the second half of FY 2025, despite a high comparison base in the appliance sector.\n\nJPMorgan also notes that JD.com's profit margins are likely to continue improving due to disciplined investment strategies, even as the company pursues new investment goals. The bank projects JD.com's revenue and profit to achieve double-digit year-on-year growth in Q1 2025. Furthermore, even with a high comparison base predicted by JPMorgan in Q4 2025, JD.com is expected to maintain positive growth.\n\nGiven these positive outlooks, JPMorgan sees potential for JD.com's forward P/E ratio of 9 to increase, primarily driven by upward revisions in market profit forecasts.

            "content": "A view of the exterior of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City, May 20, 2015. REUTERS\n\nOn March 9, the financial sector highlighted a significant disparity in the return on equity (ROE) between JPMorgan Chase and domestic financial holding companies in Korea. According to JPMorgan's annual report disclosed in February, the bank achieved an ROE of 18% last year, reflecting a growth trend from 14% in 2022. This figure starkly contrasts with the ROE of Korean financial institutions, which remains at about half the level of the global banking giant.\n\nThe ROE is a crucial financial metric that measures a company's ability to generate profit from its shareholders' equity, serving as a key indicator of financial performance and efficiency. In Korea, the importance of ROE has increased due to value-up policies, yet domestic financial holding companies lag behind their international counterparts. Last year, KB Financial recorded an ROE of 9.72%, Woori Financial 9.34%, Hana Financial 9.12%, and Shinhan Financial 8.6%. In comparison, Wells Fargo, ranked fourth among U.S. banks and considered to have a similar portfolio to Korean financial holding companies, reported an ROE of 11.4%.\n\nThe financial sector suggests that a more proactive asset management strategy is needed for Korean banks, moving away from an interest income-centered approach. Currently, non-interest income accounts for a significant portion of total income for global banks like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, at 48% and 42% respectively. In contrast, Korea's four major financial holding companies have a non-interest income share of only 15-25%.\n\nA financial industry analysis indicates that the profitability of domestic financial companies is significantly lacking compared to other countries due to government intervention. This underscores the challenges faced by Korean banks, which are often subject to stringent government regulations that can impact their profitability and strategic flexibility.\n\nDespite these challenges, Korean financial institutions are setting strategic goals to improve their ROE. Shinhan Financial has announced a target to achieve an ROE of 10% by 2027, while Hana Financial Group plans to maintain an ROE of over 10%. These goals reflect a broader trend in the banking industry towards diversified income streams and proactive asset management.",

Dimon also added the title Chairman of the Board to his resume one year later in 2007.\n\nDimon joined Bank One as Chairman and CEO in 2000 and later joined JPMorgan when the banks merged. He will likely remain CEO of the banking giant until his retirement.\n\nIn recent years, reports of Dimon's potential political aspirations and retirement have led to speculation about a potential succession plan at JPMorgan Chase.\n\nDimon is one of the most respected names in the financial world and has helped JPMorgan grow into the largest U.S. bank by assets and one of the 15 most valuable companies by market capitalization worldwide.\n\nHere's a look back at an investment in JPMorgan Chase when Dimon became CEO.\n\nRead Also: Jamie Dimon Equates AI To Printing Press, Steam Engine: \u2018Consequences Will Be Extraordinary\u2019\n\nWhy It's Important: Dimon officially became CEO of the banking giant on Jan. 1, 2006, a day the stock market was closed.\n\nInvestors who believed in the bank's future with Dimon at the helm could have bought shares of the stock days later.\n\nA $1,000 investment in JPMorgan on Jan. 3, 2006 could have bought 24.78 shares based on a price of $40.36 at the time.\n\nToday, the $1,000 investment would be worth $6,003.70 based on a price of $242.28 at the time of writing.

He also believes that the stock market will only regain bullish momentum if the US economy begins to show signs of strength.\n\n\u201cAn improvement in the US economic growth outlook will be required to fully reverse the recent equity market weakness.\u201d\n\nOn his forecast for stocks this year, Kostin says,\n\n\u201cEquity returns will be more modest than last year and match the trajectory of earnings growth.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley believes that the stock market will see \u201cmuted\u201d gains this year. Andrew Slimmon, the firm\u2019s head of applied equity advisors team, says stocks have been in a bull market since 2023, leading to concerns that the market may be overvalued.\n\nSlimmon also says that the third year of an equities bull market typically prints mediocre gains on average based on historical data.\n\n\u201cWith enough negatives out there, including higher-for-longer interest rates and geopolitical noise, to cause a subpar year, the recently minted optimists could revert to being skeptics, only to have the market roar again in 2026. In that case, 2025 could be more of a pause year than anything more sinister.\u201d\n\nLast year, all three firms predicted that the S&P 500 would soar to greater heights this year, believing that a Trump presidency would create a favorable macroeconomic environment. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley predicted that the S&P 500 will reach a new all-time high of 6,500 points in 2025.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The analyst suggests that the recent weakness in the U.S. banks sector presents an opportunity, although they caution that JPMorgan\u2019s shares might still be too expensive for new investors.\n\nIn addition to the stock price movement, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is making headlines with its decision to offer up to $150 billion in securities, which could be issued in various currencies. This move is part of the company\u2019s strategy to capitalize on market conditions and potentially enhance its financial flexibility. The bank is also involved in a significant $2 billion loan for a data center project in Utah, highlighting its active role in supporting large-scale infrastructure projects.\n\nAnother factor influencing JPMorgan\u2019s market perception is the recent dismissal of a lawsuit by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) against the bank and others regarding fraud investigations. This legal development could have mixed implications for investor sentiment, as it removes a potential overhang but also raises questions about regulatory scrutiny. Overall, JPMorgan\u2019s stock performance and strategic moves continue to be closely watched by market participants.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

The new policy requires thousands of workers to be in the office five days a week, shifting away from the previous hybrid model, Fortune reported.One of the biggest concerns employees face is the lack of available workspaces. The bank uses a desk reservation system, but in some locations, it either malfunctions or follows a \u201cfirst come, first serve\u201d approach. This has led to employees arriving at the office only to find all desks occupied.\u201cThere definitely aren\u2019t enough desks for everyone, so people have to hope others are taking PTO that day to get a seat,\u201d said one East Coast-based employee. Some teams have had to relocate workers to different sections due to the shortage.JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon has consistently emphasised the importance of in-office work for collaboration and innovation. However, the shortage of desks has made it difficult for teams to work together.\u201cWe saw our seats were already occupied by others. We were forced to have to sit apart from one another,\u201d said an employee.To secure a workspace, some employees arrive up to an hour early, while others use unofficial methods such as leaving personal belongings or placing paper tents with their team\u2019s name on desks. Despite these efforts, securing a desk remains a challenge.Dimon\u2019s push for in-office work aimed to boost team morale, but some employees feel it has had the opposite effect. The desk shortages have added to workplace frustrations.\u201cYou could just tell folks that got there later were feeling a bit off-kilter,\u201d said an employee from the South.The return-to-office mandate, announced in January, requires all 317,233 employees to return full-time. Some locations, such as the Polaris regional headquarters in Ohio, which houses around 13,000 employees, were still listed as \u201cnot yet determined\u201d for RTO as of this week.In response, a group of employees launched a petition urging the bank to keep the hybrid model. However, Dimon dismissed it, reportedly saying, \u201cI don\u2019t care how many people sign that f\u2014ing petition.\u201d JPMorgan Chase is also facing unionization efforts from some workers.Beyond desk shortages, excessive noise is another challenge. Employees working in open-plan areas and cubicles struggle to concentrate due to constant conversations and Zoom calls.\u201cPeople don\u2019t know how loud they are on Zooms and, of course, if you have a dozen people Zooming then you\u2019re going to hear all of that,\u201d said a Midwest-based employee. Some workers use noise-canceling headphones to block out distractions.Wi-Fi problems have also disrupted work. Earlier this week, a group of East Coast employees were unable to connect for hours and were advised to work from home until the issue was resolved. \u201cThat was an entire day wasted,\u201d one worker said.Some employees have raised concerns about colleagues coming to work sick without wearing masks, potentially spreading illnesses.One worker described sitting next to a colleague who was \u201ccoughing and sneezing all day long.\u201dFor many employees, the new work environment has been difficult to adjust to. \u201cThe office is loud, crowded, and overall not an enjoyable place to be,\u201d a Midwest-based employee said.As JPMorgan Chase moves forward with its strict return-to-office policy, employees continue to face challenges that make the transition far from smooth.",

The bank is aware that we are living in times of great uncertainty, so it considers that the best thing is to be prepared. As usual, JP Morgan has put the families of our country first.\n\nThe bank has announced that it will allocate an additional $50 billion to bolster its direct lending efforts. By increasing its direct credit capacity, JP Morgan seeks to take advantage of the growing demand for flexible financing options outside the banking system.\n\nThis measure aligns with JP Morgan's broader tactic of deepening its involvement in alternative grant markets. Diversifying its sources of income and gaining a stronger position in this lucrative but competitive sector. The new investment underscores JP Morgan's aggressive push to capture a greater market share in direct financing.\n\n| Pixelshot, Google Maps, JP Morgan\n\nMore Direct Financing, JP Morgan's Key Bet\n\nJP Morgan's decision to allocate $50 billion for direct credits marks a significant expansion of its efforts in the sector. The bank has increasingly focused on providing direct financing to businesses and consumers, bypassing traditional contacts like commercial banks. This move allows JP Morgan to offer more competitive loan terms, faster approval processes, and tailored financial products.\n\nJP Morgan is positioning itself as a leader in a market expected to see substantial growth in the coming years. The additional capital will be allocated to both corporate and individual financing. Making it a key player in shaping the future of credit outside the banking system.\n\nJP Morgan's direct credit initiative is considered a strategic response to a shift in financial behavior. In which borrowers are increasingly seeking flexible and alternative sources of capital.\n\n| Getty Images, Google Maps\n\nHow JP Morgan's Decision Will Affect Borrowers\n\nFor businesses and individuals seeking financing, JP Morgan's $50 billion push could be a game changer. The new financing will allow the bank to offer more personalized solutions, with faster approvals and potentially better terms than traditional banks.\n\nThe move is expected not only to help JP Morgan capture a larger share of the credit sector but also to boost competition in the financial sector. For borrowers, this could mean more favorable conditions. Since JP Morgan's push to gain market share could result in more competitive interest rates and flexible payment options.",

Since she joined JP Morgan in 2022, she has worked from home two days a week. Meanwhile, I've been working remotely as a freelancer in sports marketing.\n\nStarting in March, my partner will have to go into the office four days a week \u2014 and that's only due to the lack of desk space on-site. Once that's resolved? The assumption is that she'll be in the office full-time.\n\nMy partner and I have spent much of our relationship benefiting from the ability to work remotely.\n\nHaving been told that her employer, JP Morgan, is now demanding full-time office hours, I'm concerned about how our relationship will be affected \u2014 not only in the immediate future but our long-term goals, too.\n\nWorking from home brought us closer together\n\nMy partner and I both live hectic social lives. Time spent at home and in each other's company is precious. Two days a week working side-by-side might not sound like quality time, but it encompasses a lot.\n\nWe typically walk and talk on our lunch breaks while catching some fresh air. We sometimes cook lunch together and escape whatever work woes occupy our brains. We often catch up on chores during the workday, facilitating further time spent together in the evenings that would otherwise be occupied with the mundane.\n\nThanks to working from home, she also forgoes the hourlong commute at both ends of her workday, giving us even more time together.\n\nThat precious quality time is something I'm terrified we'll miss.\n\nWe had long-term goals that were tied to our work-from-home jobs\n\nSince my partner and I worked from home, we were able to plan for our futures outside work. Our main goal was to travel. I had hoped our jobs would head toward full-time remote work, allowing us to travel whenever we wanted.\n\nRelated stories\n\nWe planned to visit cities that interested us for short stays. I imagined us finishing our work days in an Airbnb and then stepping outside in the evening to explore a new part of the world.\n\nTraveling and keeping our full-time, remote jobs was our long-term dream.\n\nI thought the consistent evidence that we were fully committed to our roles and fulfilling our job duties would get us to this dream. But I was wrong. We worked hard to be forced back into the office.\n\nI'm scared of what comes next\n\nMy partner is about to start working four days a week in the office. She thinks it's only a matter of time before she must be there five days a week.\n\nGone will be those shared lunch breaks and the connection they offered. Gone will be those extra hours of personal life that no commute or lunch at home permits. But that's just the small stuff.\n\nThe big impact? We can no longer look toward the future for travel plans. I'm still learning to deal with the loss of our dream. When we met, our ambitions aligned. It felt like we'd be able to experience the world as a couple \u2014 without sacrificing money, career progression, or love.\n\nAll of a sudden, it feels as if our hot air balloon has burst. Thanks to the weight of realities we previously thought were untethered to our ride, we're drifting back down to Earth.\n\nWhile I'm sure we'll survive this change to our dynamic, the world suddenly feels a little smaller. My hopes, our hopes, feel a lot more distant. It's been a sucker punch to a dream that would have felt unreal to experience.",

Nonfarm payrolls in the U.S. added 151,000 jobs last month, 9,000 less than expected. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1% when economists had expected 4%, and average hourly earnings rose 0.3% from the prior month, in line with expectations. Furthermore, the number of jobs added in January were revised down by 18,000 to 125,000.\n\nBanks are cyclical, so investors tend to get concerned when they see weakness in the economy because it can result in higher loan losses, and also lead to a decrease in lending activity if businesses don't grow and consumer spending declines.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump continues to go back and forth on tariffs, a cycle that has seemingly exhausted investors. Trump on Tuesday implemented sweeping 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. On Wednesday, he exempted goods covered under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) until April 2. Today, Trump floated the idea of tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy goods. Trump also threatened tariffs and new sanctions on Russia as he seeks further progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nLarge banks are exposed to the broader economy\n\nLarge banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have relationships with consumers and businesses in nearly every sector of the economy, so if investors get worried about the economy or the impact of tariffs on economic growth, the sector is likely to take a hit.\n\nLonger term, however, I certainly don't hate the set up for banks. The sector faces a much friendlier regulatory environment under Trump, and hopefully, the yield curve continues to steepen, which is when bank profits tend to perform best. While I don't think you should sell JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, I see better opportunities in the small- and mid-cap space where valuations are more attractive and where mergers and acquisitions activity could pick up as the year progresses.",

Staley has consistently denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cWhile I did not consider there was a sufficiently strong enough basis to suspect the applicant was involved in criminal conduct with Mr. Epstein, as initially alleged by JPM, I considered there was a strong basis to suspect the true nature of the relationship was materially different from the impression conveyed in the 8 October 2019 response and this justified opening an investigation,\u201d Steward said.\n\nThe FCA has never accused Staley of any involvement in criminal activities. The regulator opened a probe into whether Staley had given a proper account of his friendship with the late pedophile financier and ultimately found that he had \u201crecklessly misled\u201d the FCA. It hit Staley with a lifetime ban and fined him \u00a31.8 million ($2.3 million) \u2014 which the former banker is challenging.\n\nIn a witness statement shown to the court in London, Steward said JPMorgan highlighted two payments made to a woman in 2009, when Staley worked at the bank. The woman\u2019s identity has been redacted. The first payment came in January 2009, when Staley traveled to Florida to meet Epstein at his Palm Beach office, and the second was made in September of that year when Staley was set to make a trip to London.\n\nKathleen Harris, a lawyer for Staley, referred to the FCA\u2019s own statement set out earlier this week when contacted for comment.\n\n\u201cAt no point has the authority sought to make the case that Mr. Staley was involved in or witnessed the conduct of Mr. Epstein which formed the subject of the allegations made against him and led to his arrest,\u201d the FCA said.",

In essence, Capital One \u201cde-banked\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Accounts because Capital One believed that the political tide at the moment favored doing so.\n\nIn addition to the considerable financial harm that Plaintiffs and their affiliated entities suffered, Capital One\u2019s reckless decision is part of a growing trend by financial institutions in the United States of America to cut off a consumer\u2019s access to banking services if their political views contradict with those of the financial institution. Capital One\u2019s conduct is but one example of a systemic, subversive industry practice that aims to coerce the public to shift and re-align their political views.\u201d\n\nThe move comes after Trump openly slammed both Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nAt a World Economic Forum session in January, Trump publicly criticized Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nHe accused them of denying services to conservatives, urging them to \u201copen your banks\u201d to those who have allegedly been unfairly kicked out of the banking system.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks touch on a broader debate over alleged discrimination in the financial sector.\n\nThis month, after meeting with Republican lawmakers, Chase\u2019s Dimon said US banks sometimes \u201cpush people out of the system\u201d due to vague federal anti-money laundering rules.\n\nDimon denied political or religious bias at Chase, instead blaming regulatory pressures that force compliance-driven account closures.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Constituents are selected based on company market capitalization and weighted by free float market capitalization.\n\nThe Russell 3000 Index is a capitalization-weighted stock market index that seeks to be a benchmark of the entire U.S. stock market. It measures the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. companies representing approximately 96% of the investable U.S. equity market.\n\nThe S&P 500 Equal Weight Index is the equal-weight version of the widely-used S&P 500. The index includes the same constituents as the capitalization weighted S&P 500, but each company in the S&P 500 EWI is allocated a fixed weight of the index total at each quarterly rebalance.\n\nThe Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is a broad-based flagship benchmark that measures the investment grade, US dollar-denominated, fixed-rate taxable bond market. The index includes Treasuries, government-related and corporate securities, MBS (agency fixed-rate pass-throughs), ABS and CMBS (agency and non-agency).\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are a group of influential companies in the U.S. stock market: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla.\n\nThe Magnificent 7 Index is an equal-dollar weighted equity benchmark consisting of a fixed basket of 7 widely-traded companies (Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla) classified in the United States and representing the Communications, Consumer Discretionary and Technology sectors as defined by Bloomberg Industry Classification System (BICS).\n\nThe S&P Midcap 400 Index is a capitalization-weighted index which measures the performance of the mid-range sector of the U.S. stock market.\n\nThe S&P 500 index is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities and serves as the foundation for a wide range of investment products. The index includes 500 leading companies and captures approximately 80% coverage of available market capitalization.\n\nBonds are subject to interest rate risk, credit, call, liquidity and default risk of the issuer. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.\n\nStandard and Poor\u2019s 500 Index is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks. The index is designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries. The index was developed with a base level of 10 for the 1941\u201343 base period.\n\nThe Bloomberg Eco Surprise Index shows the degree to which economic analysts under- or over-estimate the trends in the business cycle. The surprise element is defined as the percentage difference between analyst forecasts and the published value of economic data releases.\n\nThe MSCI World Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure global developed market equity performance.\n\nThe NASDAQ 100 Index is a basket of the 100 largest, most actively traded U.S companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.

The index does not include fees or expenses.\n\nWe believe the information contained in this material to be reliable but do not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

You may not invest directly in an index.\n\nThe price of equity securities may rise or fall due to the changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to 'stock market risk' meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.\n\nInvesting in fixed income products is subject to certain risks, including interest rate, credit, inflation, call, prepayment and reinvestment risk. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to substantial gain or loss.\n\nIn general, the bond market is volatile and bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. Longer term securities are more prone to price fluctuation than shorter term securities. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to substantial gain or loss. Dependable income is subject to the credit risk of the issuer of the bond. If an issuer defaults no future income payments will be made.\n\nWhen investing in mutual funds or exchange-traded and index funds, please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses associated with the funds before investing. You may obtain a fund\u2019s prospectus by contacting your investment professional. The prospectus contains information, which should be carefully read before investing.\n\nInvestors should understand the potential tax liabilities surrounding a municipal bond purchase. Certain municipal bonds are federally taxed if the holder is subject to alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, are federally taxable. The investor should note that the income from tax-free municipal bond funds may be subject to state and local taxation and the alternative minimum tax (amt).\n\nInternational investments may not be suitable for all investors. International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations. Investments in international markets can be more volatile.\n\nInvestments in emerging markets may not be suitable for all investors. Emerging markets involve a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.\n\nInvestments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss.\n\nReal estate investments trusts may be subject to a high degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.\n\nInvestment in alternative investment strategies is speculative, often involves a greater degree of risk than traditional investments including limited liquidity and limited transparency, among other factors and should only be considered by sophisticated investors with the financial capability to accept the loss of all or part of the assets devoted to such strategies.\n\nStructured products involve derivatives and risks that may not be suitable for all investors. The most common risks include, but are not limited to, risk of adverse or unanticipated market developments, issuer credit quality risk, risk of lack of uniform standard pricing, risk of adverse events involving any underlying reference obligations, risk of high volatility, risk of illiquidity/little to no secondary market, and conflicts of interest. Before investing in a structured product, investors should review the accompanying offering document, prospectus or prospectus supplement to understand the actual terms and key risks associated with the each individual structured product.

            "content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This article has been updated to include a statement from Zelle.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau dropped its lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM, Wells Fargo & Co WFC and Bank of America Corp BAC on Tuesday concerning the banks\u2019 alleged failure to prevent fraud on Zelle. The Trump Administration has wound down CFPB cases in recent weeks.\n\nWhat Happened: The agency dismissed its case against the banks and Early Warning Services, Zelle\u2019s parent company, CNBC reports. The lawsuit was originally brought in December during the Biden Administration.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that banks did not do enough to protect and reimburse consumers from fraud on Zelle. The defendants allegedly rushed to launch Zelle without implementing sufficient anti-fraud protections. Because the cases were dismissed with prejudice, the agency will not bring similar charges against the banks again.\n\nA Zelle spokesperson said, \"We welcome the CFPB's decision to drop its lawsuit against the Zelle network. As we've said before, this lawsuit was without merit and legally and factually flawed. We look forward to continuing to provide Zelle, a trusted service, to 151 million enrolled American consumer and small business accounts.\"\n\nThe CFPB\u2019s December filing said that 210,000 Bank of America customers experienced over $290 million in collective losses, 420,000 Chase customers lost over $360 million and 280,000 Wells Fargo customers were defrauded of over $220 million since 2017.\n\nReactions: The Trump administration has ended several consumer protection cases in recent weeks. Elon Musk, senior advisor to Trump, previously said he\u2019d like to \u201cdelete\u201d the CFPB.\n\nThe CFPB\u2019s mission is to \u201cprotect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices and take action against companies that break the law.\u201d\n\nPolitical figures reacted to the cases dropped by the agency.\n\n\u201cThe CFPB makes up just 0.01% of the federal budget, yet it has returned $21 BILLION to American taxpayers,\u201d Congressman Bill Foster (D-IL) said. \u201cStill, Trump & Musk want to shut it down and make it easier for scammers to rip you off.\u201d\n\nAlso Read:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

            "content": "JPMorgan doesn't expect a big move higher in crypto in the near future. Cryptocurrencies including bitcoin rallied to start the week following a social media update by President Donald Trump on the widely expected bitcoin stockpile, which has become a \"strategic crypto reserve.\" Those gains quickly reversed as part of a broader sell-off on tariff concerns, but there is also lingering skepticism about the crypto reserve now that the market has had some time to digest it, JPMorgan's Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note Wednesday. \"Overall we believe that crypto markets are likely to remain under pressure over the near term,\" he said. \"Not only is there skepticism about congressional approval for such a strategic crypto reserve, but also the feasibility of including smaller tokens outside bitcoin and [ether] given their higher risk and volatility.\" Panigirtzoglou went on to highlight that bitcoin reserves have failed to gain traction at the state level, with Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming rejecting proposals due to concerns about risk and volatility. The central banks of Switzerland and Poland have also rejected the idea, he noted. With the market still absent a crypto-specific catalyst, demand for bitcoin has weakened, he also pointed out. \"Institutional investors appeared to have also reduced their positions due to lack of positive catalysts and due to momentum decay,\" he said. \"Our futures position proxies for bitcoin and [ether] based on open interest changes in CME futures contracts, have subsided but rather modestly \u2026 suggesting there is room for further position unwinding, especially now that momentum traders have started building up short positions.\" Another sign of weaker demand is the recent $2 billion convertible debt issued by Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, Panigirtzoglou said. Since the election, Strategy and bitcoin miners such as Mara Holdings have raised large amounts of capital by issuing equity and debt, which has contributed to bitcoin's price appreciation. But now the terms of these deals are \"increasingly more investor-friendly over the past month or so,\" he explained, \"indicating that investors are becoming more cautious and more selective.\"",

Morgan\u201d) have an actual or perceived economic or other incentive in its management of our clients\u2019 portfolios to act in a way that benefits J.P. Morgan. Conflicts will result, for example (to the extent the following activities are permitted in your account): (1) when J.P. Morgan invests in an investment product, such as a mutual fund, structured product, separately managed account or hedge fund issued or managed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or an affiliate, such as J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.; (2) when a J.P. Morgan entity obtains services, including trade execution and trade clearing, from an affiliate; (3) when J.P. Morgan receives payment as a result of purchasing an investment product for a client\u2019s account; or (4) when J.P. Morgan receives payment for providing services (including shareholder servicing, recordkeeping or custody) with respect to investment products purchased for a client\u2019s portfolio. Other conflicts will result because of relationships that J.P. Morgan has with other clients or when J.P. Morgan acts for its own account.\n\nInvestment strategies are selected from both J.P. Morgan and third-party asset managers and are subject to a review process by our manager research teams. From this pool of strategies, our portfolio construction teams select those strategies we believe fit our asset allocation goals and forward-looking views in order to meet the portfolio\u2019s investment objective.\n\nAs a general matter, we prefer J.P. Morgan managed strategies. We expect the proportion of J.P. Morgan managed strategies will be high (in fact, up to 100 percent) in strategies such as, for example, cash and high-quality fixed income, subject to applicable law and any account-specific considerations.\n\nWhile our internally managed strategies generally align well with our forward-looking views, and we are familiar with the investment processes as well as the risk and compliance philosophy of the firm, it is important to note that J.P. Morgan receives more overall fees when internally managed strategies are included. We offer the option of choosing to exclude J.P. Morgan managed strategies (other than cash and liquidity products) in certain portfolios.\n\nThe Six Circles Funds are U.S.-registered mutual funds managed by J.P. Morgan and sub-advised by third parties.

            "content": "JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) is the amalgam of two iconic names in the finance industry. The company is well respected and has been executing well. But is that enough of a reason to buy the stock?\n\nConsidering that, at the moment, the market is pricing in what seems to be a perfect performance in the future, most investors will want to think twice before jumping in. Here's a look at the problem with JPMorgan Chase's stock today.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nWhat does JPMorgan Chase do?\n\nJPMorgan Chase is a finance company. That's the best way to describe it because its business touches on several important segments of the industry. For example, it owns a large bank that services consumers and businesses. It also operates an investment bank, which helps companies raise capital. And it operates a wealth management business, which handles the details of personal investing for wealthy clients. That basically touches on all of the big business lines in the finance industry with the exception of insurance.\n\nA person holding a sign that says \"warning attention please.\"\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe roughly $700 billion market cap financial giant has been performing pretty well of late. For example, in the final quarter of 2024, JPMorgan Chase's revenue rose 11% year over year. It increased earnings by 58%. And return on equity rose to 17% from 12% in the prior year. There is a reason why investors have been pushing the stock price up.\n\nAnd that's where things get interesting if you are looking at JPMorgan Chase today. The stock has pulled back a little from its recent highs, but it is still up nearly 28% over the past year. That's more than twice the gain of the S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). Investors are pricing in a lot of good news.\n\nJPM Chart\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nJust how expensive is JPMorgan Chase?\n\nFor dividend investors, it is notable that JPMorgan Chase's roughly 2% dividend yield is near the low end of its 10-year range. That suggests a premium price tag today and should give income investors pause. However, dividend yield is a less common valuation tool.\n\nLooking at more common valuation metrics backs up the valuation concerns highlighted by the dividend yield. For example, JPMorgan Chase's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is currently sitting at around 4.25 times versus a five-year average of around 3.3 times. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is up around 12.5 times compared to a long-term average of roughly 11 times. And price-to-book value (P/B) is a bit above 2.1 times right now versus a five-year average of about 1.6 times.\n\nThe P/E ratio gap is the smallest of this group of valuation tools, suggesting only modest overvaluation. But the P/S and P/B ratios are both materially above their longer-term averages. And then you have to consider that the actual stock price is within 10% of its all-time highs at the time of this writing. This is most definitely not a stock that is on sale.\n\nNot a big enough pullback to buy JPMorgan Chase\n\nJPMorgan Chase's stock has pulled back some along with the broader market on economic concerns. But that drop isn't nearly enough to make the stock cheap if you look at traditional valuation tools or less traditional ones, like dividend yield. That doesn't mean JPMorgan Chase is a bad company, but even a good company can be a bad investment if you pay too much for it.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you\u2019d have $292,207 !*\n\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $45,326 !*\n\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $480,568!*\n\nRight now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nContinue \u00bb\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 3, 2025\n\nJPMorgan Chase is an advertising partner of Motley Fool Money.

EWS is owned by seven U.S. banks, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Those three banks are the largest financial institutions on the Zelle network, accounting for 73% of activity on Zelle in 2023.\n\nBut a filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona on Tuesday indicated that the CFPB was dismissing its lawsuit against EWS, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo with prejudice.\n\nThe dismissal comes less than a week after the CFPB dropped several enforcement actions against companies like Capital One and Rocket Homes.\n\nIn notices of voluntary dismissals that were filed, the CFPB dropped lawsuits it had brought against Capital One, Rocket Homes, Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, owned by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, and others.\n\nThose suits were all filed under the agency\u2019s previous director, Rohit Chopra, who Trump fired just weeks ago. The CPFB has since plunged into turmoil \u2014 with the White House later ordering it to halt nearly all its work. The administration also closed the agency\u2019s headquarters and moved to fire scores of its workers.\n\nTrump has defended his administration\u2019s broadside against the CFPB \u2014 including recent claims about the agency being \u201cset up to destroy people.\u201d But supporters of the agency stress that it provides crucial oversight and protects consumers from being vulnerable to predatory business practices.\n\nThe CPFB isn\u2019t the only federal agency to signal a pullback on previous enforcement action under the new administration. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has either closed or paused legal action against several cryptocurrency platforms in recent weeks, as the regulator tries to present itself as more crypto-friendly under Trump.\n\nLast month Binance and the SEC filed a joint motion to pause its high-profile lawsuit against the crypto exchange. The SEC filed a similar joint motion with Coinbase. In addition, Robinhood has said that the case against it has been closed.",

The bullish note on Carrier comes with the company\u2019s stock down 6% so far in 2025 and underperforming the broader market.\n\nStephen Tusa, a top five-star rated analyst, wrote in a note to clients that \u201cthe stock is trading below HVAC peers and sector and in our view is the most attractive of the top 3 premium HVAC players on a relative basis.\u201d He added that CARR stock is more than 25% off its 52-week high and \u201cattractively valued.\u201d\n\nTariff Uncertainty\n\nTusa acknowledged that \u201cthere is a high degree of uncertainty in HVAC\u201d right now due to U.S. import tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada. However, he added that the long-term outlook for companies operating in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) sector remains positive.\n\nThe JPMorgan Chase analyst added that he sees CARR stock at or near a bottom, and that the company\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio of 20.16 is attractive. \u201cThis one is cheap on a [sum of the parts] basis, reflective of a disconnect between the perception of fundamentals here versus peers,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCARR stock has risen 13% over the last 12 months.\n\nIs CARR Stock a Buy?\n\nThe stock of Carrier Global has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 12 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on nine Buy and three Hold recommendations issued in the last three months. The average CARR price target of $81.73 implies 27.01% upside from current levels.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on CARR stock\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "An important discussion on superconductivity. And then a brief review of topics that we might get into detail on next year. So that\u2019s the end of this podcast. Please enjoy the energy piece. And thank you for listening, and look forward to connecting with you in April, probably on healthcare. Thank you. That is, unless I get either measles or polio by.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the whole story, particularly when you look at the breadth and depth of the damages. There\u2019s a lot of political issues as well. That\u2019s important to understand. Again, we have a section on renewable jet fuel. We look at methane tracking, from U.S. basins and how satellites are helping on that effort. We, yet another section on the disintegrating prospects for the hydrogen economy.\n\nAnyway, the, our 15th annual energy paper starts with an executive summary on heliocentrism and, and solar power and the speed of the transition. We have some comments from forklifts, mill and a lot of charts on how the planet is changing. We have a long section with 70 essential charts on the energy transition that we update every year, a section on Trump\u2019s energy policies and how the pendulum is swinging again. We have a section on the high cost of European decarbonization, Europe as the world\u2019s transition leader. But it\u2019s also paying the highest price for that decarbonization. We discuss the nuclear renaissance of interest in nuclear that\u2019s happening in the OECD. We introduce our new grid optimization model to understand how you can deeply decarbonize U.S. grids and how much it would cost. There\u2019s an important section on the LA fires. Climate change is an important part of understanding why it took place with respect to wind and rain and drought.\n\nAnd so I just think that people should pay more attention to that kind of thing. The renewable jet fuel cost estimates across the board, no matter how you do it, are much higher than traditional jet fuel estimates, which is why so many of the biofuel companies have been getting crushed because once their processing costs meet the light of day, investors don\u2019t like them quite so much.\n\nI, one of the things that we discuss in here is that one of these, one of these pathways, if people were just paying attention, the thermodynamics are clear. It takes 150 megajoules of energy to go into the thing, and you get 50 megajoules of energy out of the thing. So there aren\u2019t too many successful businesses that our clients run that have a negative energy deficit like that.\n\nAnd of course, who wouldn\u2019t want sustainable jet fuel to replace traditional jet? According to this diagram, there\u2019s lots of different ways using food oils, corn, cellulosic biomass. Or you can use electrolysis. There\u2019s a lot of different pathways through which you can create sustainable aviation fuel. The problem is they\u2019re all really expensive, and, and, and then a lot of them have an energy deficit.\n\nAnd I wish sometimes people would then pay more attention to the fundamentals behind the energy things they invest in. So I want to show you just a couple of things on sustainable aviation fuels, and then we\u2019ll close. This spaghetti chart gets people very excited because when they see the individual pieces of this on a term sheet or in a in a green energy blog, or in a YouTube video, they get all excited about the ability to create sustainable jet fuel.\n\nSo this looks at the performance of a composite of different renewable indices compared to traditional oil, gas and pipeline investing. The renewables crushed everything else in 2020 during the free money period from the Fed, and has been getting absolutely decimated ever since, and somewhere around, roughly around a 40%, underperformance since the beginning of this chart.\n\nAnd this administration is extremely focused on energy policy, which is paying very close attention, attention to energy independence and national security. And obviously those priorities have, have shifted a lot versus the prior administration. And it\u2019s important to understand why. And this, this chart helps explain that. And I\u2019m just going to close, I\u2019m going to close this podcast by showing you a chart on the performance of renewables versus traditional energy.\n\nI\u2019m not going to spend too much time focused on the Trump policies. We have a couple of pages in the piece on what those energy policies are. But at the core of them, it\u2019s important to understand that the U.S. has achieved energy independence for the first time in 40 years, and unlike China and unlike Russia. And this chart here looks at the imports of net imports of oil, gas and coal, and common energy terms.\n\nSmaller renewables facilities. I also want to remind you about this green dotted line, for all the people that are really hung up on the data center issue. In 2007, the EIA made a projection of U.S. electricity demand going up a ton, and since then, actual electricity advanced, but flat. There are times when people don\u2019t appreciate increased efficiencies, and how that can sometimes offset increased demand and population growth.\n\nWhat\u2019s the important context? The important context is about electricity demand in the United States has been flat for around 20 years, but for the 20 years before that, the United States was more than capable of adding a lot of electricity generation capacity. The difference was at the time, those were large natural gas and nuclear plants that were being added rather than today.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a lot of discussion about data centers. I\u2019m not going to get too hung up on it here. I just want to show you a couple of different forecasts that are out there. If you add up data centers, electrification of vehicles and electrification of heat through heat pumps, you can, you can sense some people are penciling in a combination of a 20% increase by 2030 and electricity demand, or as low as 7%, but it\u2019s probably going to go up.\n\nRemember, the Helios interests we\u2019ve defined as the people that believe that you just need more solar, more storage, and you don\u2019t need to invest in natural gas. The, the people that run the independent system, operators are screaming from the other side, like, please pay attention. Our reserve buffers during peak summer demand are shrinking because as we retire baseload power and replace it with renewables, we\u2019re getting more and more close to the point where we might have some kind of brownout situation, and the Midwest, the Northwest, California, New England, are places where you\u2019re seeing the most acute squeeze by the end of this decade.\n\nAnd we\u2019re barely on this electrification journey. Right, so there\u2019s a lot of supply chain questions related to the equipment. And do we have enough electrical engineers, etc., etc., to implement a lot of these electrification visions that people will talk about now, the, the people that run the independent system operators in the United States disagree with the Helios interests.\n\nNot just in the United States, but in most countries. So that\u2019s another important impediment to electrification. And by the way, just for good measure, if you looked at all of the 47 categories in the producer price basket in the United States, practically the highest rate of inflation over the last few years has been transformers and power regulators.\n\nThe other thing to remember too, is electricity per unit of energy costs a lot more than natural gas. So for people that are focused on electrification of heat by industrial or residential or commercial users, yes, you can swap out your furnace or boiler for an electric heat pump that operates much more efficiently and uses less energy, but the energy that it uses can be anywhere from two to five times more expensive than the energy that you used to use because electricity is a lot more expensive than gas.\n\nBut just a few charts here. It\u2019s hard to electrify a country when the country itself is having so much trouble building transmission lines, and we\u2019ve gone from about 4,000 miles of transmission lines being added each year to less than a thousand over the last couple of years. So this is going in the opposite direction of electrification.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case with the transition that we\u2019re currently experiencing now. Just a few more exhibits and, and then I\u2019ll let you go. I mean, the piece is 50, 54 pages. There\u2019s a lot in there. And I would encourage anybody who wants to learn about energy, start with the executive summary, which is seven pages, and then pick the different topics that you find interesting.\n\nYou can\u2019t just look at this chart and say, okay, sometimes industrial transitions can be rapid. It happened because the new technology cut steel production times to a tenth of what they used to be, allowing for 80 to 90% savings in energy costs. So when you have a transition that can pay for itself like this, it can happen rapidly.\n\nNow, there can be industrial transitions that occur more quickly. One example is this very rapid, energy-saving steel transition that took place in the 60s and 70s. And within around 20 years, almost all of the global steel production processes shifted from something called open heart furnaces to basic oxygen furnaces. Why did, but why did this happen so quickly?\n\nSo for me, this chart is very important because, it\u2019s important to understand the pace at which these things can change. A lot of the stuff I read on green tech media sites and things like that, and from the Rocky Mountain Institute are constantly talking about S curves and accelerating geometric adoption of renewables. When you look at it from this perspective, it\u2019s not happening at that speed.\n\nIn the U.S., it\u2019s growing about 8.3% a year. So there\u2019s progress being made. And for people that say that there\u2019s no progress at all, they\u2019re wrong. But the progress is very slow, which results in a lot of important discussions about the other kind of energy systems that you need to simultaneously be investing in in order to maintain your prosperity.\n\nIt includes electric heat pumps displacing residential, commercial, industrial furnaces and boilers. Biofuels. Biomass. Deep geo, critical G super critical, geothermal, synthetic fuels, hydro, etc., etc. So everything\u2019s in here. And how\u2019s it going? Well, after about $9 trillion in investment globally since 2010, what we have here is a linear transition in Europe at this, the shares growing at about half a percent a year.\n\nI call this the Scorpion Bowl chart because it\u2019s, it also has everything in it. So when we produce a chart that says the renewable share of final energy consumption, it\u2019s got everything. It\u2019s got wind and solar displacing coal, it\u2019s got lithium ion battery storage, rooftop solar. It reflects electrification of cars, trucks, busses, motorcycles, electrolytic green hydrogen, carbon capture, decarbonized production of steel and ammonia cement.\n\nSo, and so that\u2019s a challenge in terms of decarbonization. And the most important chart, I think, in this year\u2019s energy piece is this one, and I call it the Scorpion Bowl chart. If anybody remembers, the, the scorpion balls were these things that you could get at the Hong Kong Bar and Harvard Square, and they had, you know, tequila and rum and gin, and all sorts of things in them.\n\nRight. So every year the renewable electricity generation is going up, but the share of electricity used in final energy consumption isn\u2019t budging in the U.S. China is making a lot of progress. A few other countries are making some progress, but in a lot more countries are like the U.S. than like China in terms of somewhat stagnant or very slow growth in electrification of energy consumption.\n\nAnd one of the, one of the, the subheads of this year\u2019s piece is the objects may be further away than they appear. It\u2019s the opposite of the thing that you see in your rearview mirror. And so here\u2019s a chart that we\u2019ve shown several times every year. The renewable share of electricity generation goes up in the U.S. and in many other countries.\n\nSo as things stand now, modern prosperity is highly reliant on fossil fuels, as we all know. But it\u2019s interesting to kind of see the numbers and see the graphs laid out like this, so that you can appreciate just how the whole, the whole piece fits together. And so it\u2019s while we should be trying to decarbonize as much as we possibly can, we have to be realistic about the pace at which this can be done.\n\nThose are the components of modern prosperity. It\u2019s very difficult to find a prosperous country that doesn\u2019t have those things in terms of either producing them or buying them from people that do. And if we look at the energy of that is used to create those industrial pillars, 80, roughly 80% of them, of the energy of the input energy is from fossil fuels, whether it\u2019s oil, natural gas or coal directly, or the coal or natural gas that\u2019s used to make electricity that is then used to produce those things.\n\nAnd because some of those, some of those people don\u2019t believe that we need to either invest in or, either existing or new gas capacity, for example, which I think is a difficult argument to make. So one way to think about this and why it\u2019s so important to understand the rest of the ecosystem is modern prosperity, in almost all places where it thrives, revolves around certain kinds of industrial products: chemicals, iron, steel, cement, food, paper, machinery, metals, textiles, and other kinds of industrial products, glass, rubber, things like that.\n\nSo while that\u2019s impressive growth from a low base, we obviously need to be more focused on the other 95% of where we\u2019re going to get our final energy consumption from, and rather than just the solar on its own. So impressive growth in solar power, declining costs, declining cost of storage, but some of the narratives about heliocentrism have gotten a little carried away.\n\nThat, that number probably doubles over the next three years, which is impressive. But as we\u2019ve talked about in this energy paper, endlessly, electricity is roughly only a third of all the energy that gets consumed. A lot of countries are electrifying at a very slow pace. So if we translate this solar power into the share of final energy consumption around the world, it\u2019s only 2%, probably growing to 4 to 5% by the end of the decade.\n\nOkay, this now, this is the part of the podcast when the buts start. So first solar, based on all the installations that exist to date, has a capacity factor of 15 to 20% around, in most places around the world, not all, but in most places where it\u2019s been installed. So if we translate that into shares of electricity generation, solar accounts for around 6% of global electricity generation.\n\nAnd if, if we think about it as a percentage of all the capacity that\u2019s being installed, it\u2019s already about two-thirds of all new generation capacity, and expected to reach about three-quarters of all generation capacity for the rest of the decade. So it\u2019s kind of a remarkable transition to see solar advancing this much and this quickly.\n\nSo let me just show you a few pictures, and then we can explore that thesis. One thing\u2019s for sure, global solar capacity, both utility scale and rooftop, is exploding. And if the forecasts from several places are correct, you can see here on the first chart that we\u2019re going to get another doubling or tripling of global solar capacity over the next just two to three years.\n\nAnd so, I enjoy it. Hopefully as much as the red crabs do. And this, this year\u2019s piece is called \u201cHeliocentrism.\u201d Heliocentrism refers to the belief for few hundred years ago, which finally emerged that the world does, that the earth revolves around the sun rather than the sun revolving around the Earth. And the reason I picked it as a topic is because there\u2019s a lot of people out there that are now so focused on the growth and solar power that they believe that solar power typically bolted on with some energy storage can represent the dominant share of where we get our energy from.\n\nNobody knows exactly why, but it\u2019s a kind of remarkable thing to see. And the whole island is overrun with these migrating red crabs. And I\u2019m showing this because I started writing this energy paper 15 years ago. Also, for reasons that are unexplained, I just decided to do it. So like a red crab every year, I go through this three- to four-month migration process of researching energy and talking about energy and writing about energy.\n\nGood morning, everybody, and welcome to the March 2025 Eye on the Market podcast. This is the one is entitled \u201cHeliocentrism.\u201d This is our podcast for the 15th annual Eye on the Market energy paper.

A blue line is labeled solar share of electricity generation. A gold line is labeled solar share of final energy consumption. The lines rise from left to right. The blue line is higher. Both lines have a circular point at 2023, where they become dotted lines with more circular points. Both lines rise more sharply after 2023, but the blue line rises more sharply than the gold line does.\n\n(SPEECH)\n\nSo, first, solar, based on all the installations that exist to date, has a capacity factor of 15% to 20% in most places around the world-- not all, but in most places where it's been installed.

Li dash ion battery storage displacement of gas peaker plants. Rooftop solar power co-located with batteries. Electric cars, trucks, buses, vans and motorcycles. Electrolytic green hydrogen displacing brown hydrogen. Decarbonized production of steel, ammonia and cement. Electric heat pump displacement of residential, commercial and industrial furnaces slash boilers. Biofuel displacement of fossil fuels for transport. Biomass and waste heat used for district heating. Deep supercritical geothermal systems. Synthetic fuels created from green hydrogen and C.O. 2 sourced from direct air carbon capture. Pumped hydro formations. Iron air batteries, vanadium redox batties and other forms of long duration energy storage.\n\n(SPEECH)\n\nthe most important chart, I think, in this year's energy piece is this one. And I call it the Scorpion Bowl chart. If anybody remembers, the scorpion bowls were these things that you could get at the Hong Kong bar in Harvard Square, and they had tequila, and rum, and gin, and all sorts of things in them.\n\nI call this the Scorpion Bowl chart because it also has everything in it. So when we produce a chart that says the renewable share of final energy consumption, it's got everything. It's got wind and solar displacing coal. It's got lithium ion battery storage, rooftop solar. It reflects electrification of cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, electrolytic gene hydrogen, carbon capture, decarbonized, production of steel, and ammonia, and cement.\n\nIt includes electric heat pumps displacing residential, commercial, and industrial furnaces and boilers, biofuels biomass, supercritical geothermal, synthetic fuels, hydro, et cetera, et cetera. So everything's in here. And how's it going?\n\nWell, after about $9 trillion of investment globally since 2010, what we have here is a linear transition. In Europe, this share is growing at about half a percent a year. In the US, it's growing at about 0.3% a year. So there's progress being made.\n\nAnd for people that say that there's no progress at all, they're wrong. But the progress is very slow, which results in a lot of important discussions about the other kind of energy systems that you need to simultaneously be investing in in order to maintain your prosperity.\n\nSo for me, this chart is very important because it's important to understand the pace at which these things can change. A lot of the stuff I read on greentech media sites and things like that, and from the Rocky Mountain Institute, are constantly talking about s-curves and accelerating geometric adoption of renewables. When you look at it from this perspective, it's not happening at that speed.\n\n(DESCRIPTION)\n\nNew slide. Text: Can industrial transitions occur more quickly? Chart: Rapid energy-saving steel transition of the 1960s slash 1970s. Near y axis, text: Percent of global steel production. The chart's y axis begins at 0% and increases in increments of 10%, with 90% as the highest number at the top. The chart's x axis has years from left to right, beginning at 1920 and increasing in increments of 20 years, ending with 2020 as the right-most year. The chart has two vertical dotted lines, with one each at 1960 and 1980. A blue line is labeled basic oxygen. A gold line is labeled electric arc furnace. The red line is labeled open hearth. From left to right, the blue line begins between 1940 and 1960, and ends as the highest line. The gold line ends as the next-highest line. The red line begins as the highest line, but ends as the lowest line. Text: The catalyst: new technologies cut steel production times to less than a tenth of open hearth furnaces, allowing for 80% dash 90% energy savings.\n\n(SPEECH)\n\nNow, there can be industrial transitions that occur more quickly. One example is this very rapid energy saving steel transition that took place in the '60s and '70s. And within around 20 years, almost all of the global steel production processes shifted from something called open hearth furnaces to basic oxygen furnaces.\n\nWhy did this happen so quickly? You can't just look at this chart and say, OK, sometimes industrial transitions can be rapid. It happened because the new technology cut steel production times to 1/10 of what they used to be, allowing for 80% to 90% savings in energy costs. So when you have a transition that can pay for itself like this, it can happen rapidly. But that's not the case with the transition that we're currently experiencing.\n\n(DESCRIPTION)\n\nNew slide. Text: Transmission line growth is stuck in a rut. Chart: U.S. transmission line growth. Near y axis, text: Miles added per year. The y axis begins at 0 and increases in increments of 1,000, with 10,000 as the highest number at the top. The x axis has years, beginning at 2013, increasing in increments of 2 years, and ending with 2035 as the right-most year. A line has blue circular points. It begins at 4,000 at 2013. The right-most point on the line is between 0 and 1,000, at 2023. A red dotted line between 5,000 and 6,000, and near 2023 to between 2029 and 2031 is labeled D.O.E. 2030 target. A red dotted line near 10,000, and near between 2021 and 2023, to 2035, is labeled D.O.E. 2035 target.\n\n(SPEECH)\n\nNow, just a few more exhibits, and then I'll let you go. I mean, the piece is 54 pages. There's a lot in there. And I would encourage anybody who wants to learn about energy, start with the executive summary, which is seven pages, and then pick the different topics that you find interesting. But just a few charts here.\n\nIt's hard to electrify a country when the country itself is having so much trouble building transmission lines. And we've gone from about 4,000 miles of transmission lines being added each year to less than 1,000 over the last couple of years. So this is going in the opposite direction of electrification.\n\nThe\n\n(DESCRIPTION)\n\nNew slide. Text: Another impediment to electrification. Chart: Electrification is expensive compared to gas. Near y axis, text: Electricity cost per M.J. divided by natural gas cost per M.J., 85% industrial and 90% residential furnace efficiency. On the y axis, from bottom to top, labels: Florida Residential, China Industrial, Germany Residential, Texas Residential, Germany Industrial, Louisiana Industrial, California Residential, U.K. Residential, California Industrial, Texas Industrial. Each label has a blue bar. The blue bars increase in size from bottom to top. The x axis has labels: 0 x, 1 x, 2 x, 3 x, 4 x, 5 x.\n\n(SPEECH)\n\nother thing to remember, too, is electricity per unit of energy costs a lot more than natural gas. So for people that are focused on electrification of heat by industrial, or residential, or commercial users, yes, you can swap out your furnace or boiler for an electric heat pump that operates much more efficiently and uses less energy.\n\nBut the energy that it uses can be anywhere from two to five times more expensive than the energy that you used to use, because electricity is a lot more expensive than gas-- not just in the United States, but in most countries. So that's another important impediment to electrification.\n\n(DESCRIPTION)\n\nNew slide. Text: inflation. Chart: Producer price inflation: core goods. Text near y axis: percent increase versus 2018 for each of the 47 core goods categories. The y axis has labels starting with negative 10% at the bottom, increasing in increments of 10%, with 80% as the highest number at the top. The chart has many blue circles in a decreasing line from left to right. The second-highest circle is red and is labeled Transformers and power regulators.\n\n(SPEECH)\n\nAnd, by the way, just for good measure, if you looked at all of the 47 categories in the producer price basket in the United States, practically the highest rate of inflation over the last few years has been transformers and power regulators. And we're barely on this electrification journey, right? So there's a lot of supply chain questions related to the equipment, and do we have enough electrical engineers, et cetera, et cetera, to implement a lot of these electrification visions that people will talk about.\n\n(DESCRIPTION)\n\nNew slide. Text: Reserve margins. Chart: Generation capacity buffer during peak summer demand. Near y axis, text: Anticipated reserve margin. The y axis has labels beginning at 0% at the bottom, increasing in increments of 5%, with 45% as the highest number at the top. The x axis has years, beginning with 2025, increasing in increments of 2 years, with 2035 as the right-most year. Colored lines are labeled, in order of their final position on the chart, from highest position to lowest position: ERCOT parentheses Texas close parentheses, S.P.P. parentheses Plains close parentheses, Southeast, P.J.M. parentheses mid-Atlantic close parentheses, New England, New York, California, Northwest, M.I.S.O. parentheses Midwest close parentheses.\n\n(SPEECH)\n\nNow, the people that run the independent system operators in the United States disagree with the heliocentrists. Remember, the heliocentrists we've defined as the people that believe that you just need more solar, more storage, and you don't need to invest in natural gas. The people that run the independent system operators are screaming from the other side, like, please pay attention.\n\nOur reserve buffers during peak summer demand are shrinking because, as we retire baseload power and replace it with renewables, we're getting more and more close to the point where we might have some kind of brownout situation. And the Midwest, Northwest, California, New England are places where you're seeing the most acute squeeze by the end of this decade.\n\n(DESCRIPTION)\n\nNew slide. Text: Electricity demand. Chart: U.S. electricity demand forecast. Near the y axis, text: T.W.h. The y axis begins with 2,500, increases in increments of 500, and ends with 5,500 as the highest number at the top. The x axis has years, beginning with 1985 on the left, increasing in increments of 5 years, with 2023 as the right-most year. A blue line with blue circular points is labeled electricity demand, generally increasing from left to right. A dotted green line increases sharply from the blue line, beginning near 2005 to between 2020 and 2025. The green line is labeled E.I.A. 2007 projection. From highest to lowest between 2025 and 2030, a vertical red line with red circular points has circular points which are labeled: plus Heat pumps, plus Elec vehicles, plus Data centers, 2023 demand. There is a vertical gold line with gold circular points to the left of the line with red circular points. A red line segment with a circular point is labeled: High end plus 19%. A gold line segment with a circular point is labeled: Low end, plus 7%.\n\n(SPEECH)\n\nNow, there's a lot of discussion about data centers. I'm not going to get too hung up on it here. I just want to show you a couple of different forecasts that are out there. If you add up data centers, electrification vehicles, and electrification of heat through heat pumps, some people are penciling in a combination of a 20% increase by 2030 in electricity demand or as low as 7%. But it's probably going to go up.\n\nWhat's the important context? The important context is that electricity demand in the United States has been flat for around 20 years, but for the 20 years before that, the United States was more than capable of adding a lot of electricity generation capacity. The difference was, at the time, those were large natural gas and nuclear plants that were being added, rather than today's smaller renewable facilities.\n\nI also want to remind you about this green dotted line. For all the people that are really hung up on the data center issue, in 2007, the EIA made a projection of US electricity demand going up a ton. And since then, actual electricity demand has been flat. There are times when people don't appreciate increased efficiencies and how that can sometimes offset increased demand and population growth.\n\n(DESCRIPTION)\n\nNew slide.

The x axis has years, beginning with 1980 and increasing in increments of 10 years, with 2020 as the right-most year. Near the top left of the chart: text: Net importer, up arrow. Near the bottom left of the chart, text: Net exporter, down arrow. A gold line is labeled Europe. A red line is labeled China. A light blue line is labeled U.S. A dark blue line is labeled Russia. The entirety of the dark blue line is below a straight line extending from left to right at the number 0 on the y axis. From top to bottom, the ending point of the lines are China as the highest, Europe, U.S., and Russia as the lowest. The line for U.S. extends below the zero line slightly before 2020 on the chart.\n\n(SPEECH)\n\nI'm not going to spend too much time focused on the Trump policies. We have a couple of pages in the piece on what those energy policies are. But at the core of them, it's important to understand that the US has achieved energy independence for the first time in 40 years, unlike China and unlike Russia.\n\nAnd this chart here looks at the net imports of oil, and gas, and coal, and common energy terms. And this administration is extremely focused on energy policy, which is paying very close attention to energy independence and national security. And, obviously, those priorities have shifted a lot versus the prior administration.\n\nAnd it's important to understand why. And this chart helps explain that. And I'm just going to close this podcast by showing you a chart on the performance of renewables versus traditional energy.\n\n(DESCRIPTION)\n\nNew slide. Text: Renewables underperformance. Chart: Renewables versus traditional energy: annual outperformance. Near the y axis, text: Renewables composite return minus traditional energy return. The y axis has labels beginning at negative 75%, increasing in increments of 25%, with 200% as the highest number at the top. The x axis has years, beginning with 2016, increasing in increments of 1 year, with 2025 as the right-most single year. After 2025, there is a label 2016 dash 2025, as the right-most label on the chart's x axis. The chart has text near the top left: Renewables composite parentheses equal weighted close parentheses: NASDAQ Clean Edge. Wilderhill Clean Energy. F.T.S.E. Renew slash Alt Energy. S. & P. Global Clean Energy. M.A.C. Global Solar. The chart has text near the top right: Traditional: M.S.C.I. World Energy Index parentheses oil, gas and pipelines close parentheses. Each single year on the chart's x axis has a blue bar extending either up or down from 0% on the y axis. The 2016 to 2025 label has a gold bar extending down from 0% on the y axis.\n\n(SPEECH)\n\nSo this looks at the performance of a composite of different renewable indices compared to traditional oil, gas, and pipeline investing. The renewables crushed everything else in 2020 during the free money period from the Fed and has been getting absolutely decimated ever since-- somewhere around roughly around a 40% underperformance since the beginning of this chart.\n\nAnd I wish sometimes people would pay more attention to the fundamentals behind the energy things they invest in. So\n\n(DESCRIPTION)\n\nNew slide. Text: Biofuels. Chart: Sustainable jet fuel pathways. White boxes on the chart are labeled: Food oils. Corn, sugarcane. Cellulosic biomass. Water plus electricity.

This spaghetti chart gets people very excited, because when they see the individual pieces of this on a term sheet, or in a green energy blog, or in a YouTube video, they get all excited about the ability to create sustainable jet fuel.\n\nAnd, of course, who wouldn't want sustainable jet fuel to replace traditional jet fuel? According to this diagram, there's lots of different ways, using food oils, corn, cellulosic biomass, or you can use electrolysis. There's a lot of different pathways through which you can create sustainable aviation fuel. The problem is they're all really expensive.\n\n(DESCRIPTION)\n\nNew slide. Text: Biofuels. Chart: Production of 1 kg of e-methane via Sabatier reaction. Near the y axis, text: Megajoules. The chart's y axis begins at 0 and increases in increments of 25, with 150 as the highest number at the top. The chart's x axis has two labels: energy in, energy out. The Energy in label has a bar that extends up from 0 to 150, with three sections, from largest at the bottom to smallest at the top: a grey section labeled Electrolysis for green hydrogen, a gold section labeled Sabatier reaction, a blue section labeled D.A.C.C. for atmospheric C.O. 2. The Energy out label has a bar that extends up from 0 to slightly above 50. It is pink and is labeled: Synfuel: e-methane. A box in the chart's upper right area has text: D.A.C.C.: 366 kWh of electricity and 5.25 G.J. of thermal heat per ton of C.O. 2. Sabatier reaction: 75% efficiency. Electrolysis: 55 kWh of electricity per kg of H. 2.\n\n(SPEECH)\n\nAnd a lot of them have an energy deficit. One of the things that we discuss in here is that one of these pathways, if people were just paying attention, the thermodynamics are clear. It takes 150 megajoules of energy to go into the thing, and you get 50 megajoules of energy out of the thing.\n\nSo there aren't too many successful businesses that our clients run that have a negative energy deficit like that. And so I just think that people should pay more attention to that kind of thing. The\n\n(DESCRIPTION)\n\nNew slide. Text: Biofuels. Chart: Renewable jet fuel cost estimates.

We have some comments from Vaclav Smil and a lot of charts on how the planet is changing.\n\nWe have a long section with 70 essential charts on the energy transition that we update every year, a section on Trump's energy policies and how the pendulum is swinging again. We have a section on the high cost of European decarbonization.\n\nEurope is the world's transition leader, but it's also paying the highest price for that decarbonization. We discuss the nuclear renaissance of interest in nuclear that's happening in the OECD. We introduce our new grid optimization model to understand how you can deeply decarbonize US grids and how much it would cost.\n\nThere's an important section on the LA fires. Climate change is an important part of understanding why it took place with respect to wind, and rain, and drought. But that's not the whole story, particularly when you look at the breadth and depth of the damages. There's a lot of political issues as well that's important to understand.\n\nAgain, we have a section on renewable jet fuel. We look at methane tracking from US basins and how satellites are helping on that effort. We have yet another section on the disintegrating prospects for the hydrogen economy, an important discussion on superconductivity, and then a brief review of topics that we might get into detail on next year.\n\nSo that's the end of this podcast.

This school has been the perfect fit for me.\u201d\n\nAs impressive as her golf career at AU has been as a four-year starter, Conway\u2019s academic career is even more distinguished.\n\nNot only has Conway earned several all-academic golf honors at AU and is an Emerson Scholar, she also is a member of the Eagle Investment Group, she co-founded the Ashland Finance Club and, of course, she earned a prestigious JPMorgan Chase summer internship, as well as another internship the summer before at Webull Financial, a brokerage firm in St. Petersburg, Florida, where she was a rotational intern, rotating between treasury, margin and risk, client services and project management.\n\nImage\n\nConway grateful for everyone at AU who has helped her\n\nShe credits the supportive community, individualized attention and the opportunities to grow academically, athletically and personally at AU for her success the past four years and for helping her obtain two valuable internships that have already led to a full-time job waiting for her after graduation.\n\n\u201cOn top of Ashland\u2019s incredible staff and academic rigor, I believe the one-on-one attention I received here is what truly sets me apart against peers from other schools,\u201d Conway said.\n\nFor the people AU brought into her life, including her friends, classmates and teammates, as well as professors, support staff and coaches, Conway said she will always be grateful.\n\nThose people also are grateful to have crossed paths with Conway and look forward to what the future brings for her.\n\n\u201cEmma is inimitable,\u201d said Tim Hinkel, Ph.D., chair of the Accounting and Management Information Systems program at AU and a mentor for Conway. \u201cHer unique skill set combines elite intelligence, preternatural confidence and effortless communication. I know the students prefer the term academic weapon \u2013 which she is \u2013 but I find it more appropriate to call her an academic unicorn.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m genuinely curious to see what she accomplishes in her career,\u201d he added.",

Investors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks, as they have demonstrated strong long-term performance, especially during times of elevated interest rates.\n\nThe report mentioned that one possible scenario for 2025 is that earnings-per-share growth outpaces market gains, leading to a decline in overall price-to-earnings valuations. Factors such as prolonged high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainties could contribute to a lackluster year, causing some of the recent optimism to fade. However, if this happens, the market could regain momentum in 2026, making 2025 more of a temporary pause rather than a deeper downturn.\n\nAnalysts do not expect the market\u2019s strong run to persist this year. A report from Morgan Stanley points out that while the third year of a bull market tends to deliver only modest returns on average, it is usually not negative.\n\nStock market investors have enjoyed strong annual returns over the past two years, but analysts caution that 2025 may not deliver a repeat performance. In 2024, the broader market posted a 23% gain, following a 24% increase in 2023. When factoring in dividends, total returns for those years reached 25% and 26%, respectively. However, such sustained high returns are uncommon. According to Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, US stocks have only recorded three consecutive years of 20%-plus total returns once since 1928, during the late 1990s.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 15 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against the other stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhen assessing the reliability of dividend stocks, analysts suggest that investors should emphasize dividend growth rather than being lured by high yields that may not be sustainable. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar\u2019s Index team, underscored the significance of dividend growth as a strategy distinct from high-yield investing. He pointed out that companies with consistent dividend growth often have strong competitive advantages and promising future outlooks. A portfolio focused on dividend growth generally mirrors the broader market in terms of sector allocation and the balance between growth and value characteristics, including price-to-earnings ratios. While it leans toward a value-driven approach, it remains more balanced and core-oriented compared to portfolios concentrated on high-yield stocks.\n\nAlthough dividend stocks did not experience the same level of gains as tech stocks in 2024, they still delivered impressive returns. That year, companies across the broader market that distributed dividends returned approximately 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, according to Bloomberg. On average, these companies had a dividend yield of around 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield was about 1.5%. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the broader market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned the list of the companies in the broader market and picked dividend stocks with dividend yields of about 2%, as of February 27. From that list, we picked 15 dividend stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of Q4 20234. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) the Best Affordable Dividend Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 123\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is an American multinational financial services company that offers services in commercial banking, financial transaction processing, and asset management. In 2024, the bank achieved record-breaking financial results, with annual revenue exceeding $177 billion and net income surpassing $58 billion. Both figures reflected strong double-digit growth from the previous year, with revenue increasing by 12% and profitability rising by 18%.\n\nThese milestones were largely driven by growth across all three of its primary business divisions. The core Consumer and Community Banking unit saw a 2% increase from 2023, while the Commercial and Investment Banking and Asset and Wealth Management segments each posted a solid 9% gain.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has established itself as a leading dividend stock, maintaining consistent payouts since 1972. In the latest quarter, the company reinforced its commitment to shareholder returns by distributing $3.5 billion in dividends. Its quarterly dividend comes in at $1.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.9%, as of February 27.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has also built up a substantial reserve of excess capital, amounting to approximately 10% of its market capitalization, while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital management. Although share repurchases have not been a primary focus, the company still bought back $6.36 billion worth of stock in Q3 2024. As economic conditions improve, it is expected to gradually reduce its cash reserves and enhance capital returns to shareholders.\n\nOverall JPM ranks 1st on our list of the best S&P 500 dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for JPM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "13th edition of Guide explores key themes that will impact retirement planning this year, including Social Security and guaranteed income\n\nNEW YORK, March 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- J.P. Morgan Asset Management today released the 13th edition of its annual Guide to Retirement. This year's Guide offers a fresh perspective on the evolving landscape of retirement planning, focusing on key themes such as Social Security, guaranteed income, and the importance of long-term investment strategies. It also includes a new section on Social Security/Health, highlighting the important role these topics play in shaping retirement planning discussions. By utilizing anonymized household data and proprietary research, the Guide provides actionable insights to help advisors, consultants, defined contribution plan participants and sponsors navigate unforeseen retirement roadblocks and improve retirement outcomes.\n\n\"Retirement means different things to different people, and planning for it involves a multitude of decisions which can feel daunting or overwhelming. However, the core principles of a secure retirement are approachable and within reach. It's more important than ever to empower individuals with the tools and knowledge they need to secure their retirement future,\" said Michael Conrath, Chief Retirement Strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"The 2025 Guide to Retirement offers a comprehensive look at how retirement planning is evolving. It enables advisors and their clients to make informed decisions that align with their long-term goals, giving them the confidence to achieve their saving and spending targets.\"\n\nSharon Carson, J.P. Morgan Asset Management Retirement Strategist, added, \"The ability to simplify the answers to the most common retirement planning questions is crucial in today's rapidly evolving financial landscape. With the Guide to Retirement, our goal is to shed light on the most salient retirement issues facing U.S. retirees, such as why it is important to invest over the long-term and what they should consider regarding their Social Security benefits. Our proprietary research can help individuals at all life stages enhance their retirement plans and financial security.\"\n\nBelow are four key themes featured in the 2025 Guide to Retirement:\n\nTheme #1 - Don't plan to be average \u2013 know your savings goal. It is important to plan for a longer life expectancy, which could mean 35 years in retirement. More than half of female non-smokers in excellent health will pass age 90, and 4 in 10 healthy non-smoking men are expected to do the same. Given this, understanding your savings target and investing a portion of your retirement portfolio for growth is important to maintain purchasing power over time.\n\nTheme #2 - Savings alone won't fund retirement \u2013 invest for the long-term. Emotional reactions to market declines can harm portfolios since the best days are likely to occur close to the worst days. Missing the 10 best days of the market over the past 20 years would have reduced a portfolio's annualized return by almost 50%, missing the top 40 days would have a negative annualized return on the original investment. Staying invested with a diversified long-term investment strategy tends to produce a better retirement outcome.\n\nTheme #3 - Know what to expect from Social Security. Our research indicates that waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security can boost benefit checks by 24% compared to claiming at full retirement age for those born in 1960 or later. On the other hand, starting benefits early at age 62 means receiving only 70% of the full retirement amount, resulting in a permanent reduction. It's crucial to understand the benefits and tradeoffs of claiming decisions.\n\nTheme #4 - Adopt a retirement income plan that gives you confidence to spend. More guaranteed income may equal less fear of spending. A typical household might fund their retirement from a mix of investment accounts plus guaranteed income sources. Our research shows that having more guaranteed income may result in increased spending in retirement, for households with similar levels of total retirement wealth. This may be because people feel comfortable spending Social Security pensions and annuities while they are more reluctant to spend the capital of their portfolio.\n\nJ.P.

All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here.\n\n~~~\n\nThis is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio.\n\nBarry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast I have yet another extra special guest. Melissa Smith is co-head of commercial banking for JP Morgan. Previously she was co-head of the bank\u2019s Innovation Economy Group. Really fascinating because she sees the world from a very unique perch, has incredible access to every aspect of both commercial and investing banking that a small startup or medium-sized company, and by medium I mean up to $2 billion in revenue might need. And that gives her this really incredible set of insights into how these companies are growing, what they need, what direction various industries are moving in. It\u2019s really kind of fascinating \u2019cause if you remember back 20, 25 years ago, wall Street and the large investment banks and brokers were kind of accused of moving up market and abandoning that whole middle section and allowing private equity to get a a toehold there. To their credit, JP Morgan has aggressively moved back into what some people used to call, you know, middle merchant banking or middle market banking. And I thought this conversation is just a whole world that you don\u2019t know exists and is in fact robust and growing rapidly. I thought, I thought this was a fascinating conversation and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with JP Morgan\u2019s. Melissa Smith,\n\nMelissa Smith: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here.\n\nBarry Ritholtz: Well thank you for being here. Let, let\u2019s talk a little bit about your background before we work up to JP Morgan, bachelor\u2019s in political science from American University and then you get a master\u2019s in public policy from University of Chicago, not the traditional path for people in finance. What was the original plan?\n\nMelissa Smith: So I definitely thought that I was gonna work in the public sector when, when I\u2019m recruiting at JP Morgan I always, you know, get the question sort of how did, how did you get into investment banking? And I, and I would love to tell people I had a grand plan. I didn\u2019t really have a grand plan, but my policy degree was at University of Chicago. So it was very heavy econ and stats and basically the same core curriculum as the business school. And in my summer in between I worked for Mayor Daley in Chicago on economic development issues. And as I was doing that, I sort of decided it would be even more interesting to come to the public sector at a more senior level. And I also wanted to make sure that I was going somewhere that would really leverage the quantitative skills that I was acquiring at Chicago. And I also thought it\u2019d be a really good idea to be able to pay off my undergrad and grad school loans.\n\nBarry Ritholtz: So that makes a lot of sense. But before you got your master\u2019s in public policy, you have a little bit of a different professional experience. You began ballet at age four and dance professionally for how many years?\n\nMelissa Smith: For three years.\n\nBarry Ritholtz: Tell us about that. That is not the usual path to Wall Street.\n\nMelissa Smith: Definitely not. So yes, I started taking ballet at a very early age. That was my original career aspirations. Starting in seventh grade. My poor mother drove me 120 miles round trip every day to Washington DC to go to ballet where I was from, sort of left school early at noon, kind of got home at nine or 10 at night every night. And so, you know, quite frankly my parents were sick of driving me. So I graduated from high school a year early in order to dance and sort of continue my dance training and then dance professionally before I went to college. And my, again, my aspiration was to just continue dancing professionally. As you may or may not be aware, you know, very few people obviously sort of make it in that world 1e-06% are ever gonna be in a BT, which is sort of the pinnacle in the US right? American Ballet Theater. And so while I was, you know, good enough to be in a small company, I was not gonna be an A BT and I didn\u2019t wanna totally give up my education. And so that\u2019s why I stopped.\n\nBarry Ritholtz: I know people who were pretty far along that same process and as they\u2019ve gotten older they talk about like, they sound like old football players come talking about injuries, their ankles, their toes, their calves, their knees. I\u2019m like, wait, no, no, you guys are just dancing. And they laugh when you say that. What, what was your experience like with that?\n\nMelissa Smith: I mean, it was an amazing experience in that it teaches you such a huge amount of discipline and, you know, takes determination, perseverance, and kind of grit. You know, just back to, there\u2019s very few people who sort of make it, you are in a sort of a siloed world \u2019cause all, all you do every day is dance. That\u2019s kind of how, how I would describe it. And I would also say, you know, I, I can have this debate with people all day long. I think there is no greater form of athlete than a dancer. To your point, they are, it is grueling on one\u2019s body and really,\n\nBarry Ritholtz: Really physical.\n\nMelissa Smith: Really, really physical. I\u2019m in, in any way that any other athletics are. With the added sort of thing on top, which is the whole point of ballet is to make it look effortless. There\u2019s no like grunting down the basketball court or the football court, right? So it takes the same amount of strength, but you add the control of your body on top of that to make it look effortless. And that\u2019s why, you know, sort of the athleticism is, is is very unique. But it was, it was an incredible experience and I felt very lucky at a young age to have something that I was so passionate about. Not everybody sort of has that in their lives at an early age.\n\nBarry Ritholtz: And and the, your comment about perseverance and grit, those are personality characteristics. I don\u2019t know even know whether to call them skills or not, but that will help you no matter what you do.\n\nMelissa Smith: Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nBarry Ritholtz: So, so ballet to college, to grad school, how did you stumble into JP Morgan?\n\nMelissa Smith: ] So again, did not have a grand plan at the time that I was in policy school at Chicago. JP Morgan\u2019s public finance team recruited specifically at the policy school. Just back to it was this, you know, very kind of quantitatively based and so kind of randomly went to the interview to be quite honest and was, you know, did well, was offered a role sort of back to, back to my earlier point, kind of thought it was good to get some private sector credibility on my resume, learn something new. And I think probably as anybody coming out of either undergrad or grad school thinks, you know, oh, I\u2019ll go do this for five years and sort of see, see where that leads me. And lo and behold, you know, have been at JP Morgan to your point, you know, 20 plus years now that\n\nBarry Ritholtz: That\u2019s amazing. So you start as an associate, you\u2019re focused on debt. Yes. W was there an interest in debt? Was that just related to public policy? So\n\nMelissa Smith: I started in public finance, which is back to, that\u2019s why they were recruiting on the policy. So taxes and bonds for sure. You know, municipalities, I did that for about a year and a half, two years. And then I moved into debt capital markets for corporates. So kind of an, you know, easy transition taxes and bonds to, to corporate bonds. And then I spent, you know, the majority of my earlier career, the first 16 years of my career in the investment bank in debt capital markets.\n\nBarry Ritholtz: And, and just for the youngsters listening, 25 or so years ago, high rated municipal tax free bonds were yielding five, 6% maybe more, maybe\n\nMelissa Smith: More. Yeah.\n\nBarry Ritholtz: Just tho those were the, the before we start were, I guess we were only halfway through our 40 year rate cutting cycle. Right? You could get tax free yield at 7% imagine and, and a rated not junk. Yeah. Imagine what that was like. Totally. Alright, so, so you go from public finance, how did you evolve towards co-head of innovation economy?\n\nMelissa Smith: So was in debt capital markets. I like to say I grew up in debt capital markets, which as an aside, I think that was such a great experience because you know, in DCM you\u2019re sitting on the trading floor, right? I loved being in that environment \u2019cause I think it fosters learning so much more quickly. I literally sat next to the, the managing director that I worked for and would listen in on all the client calls and sort of, you understand much more quickly how to handle specific situations. I also, it was sort of an interesting dynamic where you\u2019re on the private side, on the origination side, talking to corporate clients and advising them about their next, you know, debt raise or their funding needs. But you have to spend a lot of time with the traders who are trading the bonds in, in the public markets.\n\nAnd they\u2019re obviously on the public side, so you\u2019re sort of walled off, right? But then you\u2019d have to go over on, on to talk to the traders and sometimes you\u2019d walk over there and you need information from them, but they can\u2019t give you any information. And so you\u2019d walk over there and sometimes they sort of look, look at you \u2019cause they\u2019re busy and you sort of get this feeling, you know, get outta my face, what do you want? So I think it, it was an interesting experience because you have to kind of, you know, gain some credibility with them and, you know, ask insightful questions, show that you, you have some sort of use. So I thought, thought it was a great way to kind of like grow up and learn about the business. But again, was, was in DCM for 16 years, including three years that I was in London running our European debt capital markets business.\n\nBarry Ritholtz: I got a lot of questions for you about Europe, but we\u2019ll circle back to that later. I\u2019m looking at my own handwriting. 22 or 27 years. Is that 27 years you\u2019ve been there?\n\nMelissa Smith: I think it\u2019s 26. going on 27. I feel old.\n\nBarry Ritholtz: What\u2019s more fascinating is, and you started when you were, you know, 17, so there you go, it\u2019s not a big deal, but you know, that\u2019s relatively rare these days to be at any one firm for a quarter plus century. What is so special at JP Morgan? What\u2019s kept you there for so long?\n\nMelissa Smith: Sure. So first I would say you\u2019ll actually find many senior people at JP Morgan who have been there for 20 years plus. And I think that is obviously a great testament to the culture that we have at the firm. Sure. Secondly, I would say JP Morgan is a large place, clearly. And, and what that means is there are multiple lines of business with many different things that you can do over the course of your career. And generally speaking, we are sort of number one or number two in everything that we do, which, which again is a great privilege to work there from that perspective. So it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to go necessarily to another firm when you\u2019re sort of trading down, if you will, in some, in some instances. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t say it that way, but, and so I think what\u2019s kept me there is, you know, a just the opportunity to do many different things, learn about many other aspects of the business. And two, you know, obviously, you know, very much appreciate kind of the culture and environment at JP Morgan. Kind of back to that\u2019s why people stay there for so long. It\u2019s a very teamwork oriented environment. You know, we, we like to quote JP Morgan first class business in a first class way. We take that very seriously and just appreciated that about the environment. So\n\nBarry Ritholtz: Let\u2019s talk about your dual role, your, your co-head of innovation economy and your head of specialized industries. Tell us what each of those roles encompass.\n\nMelissa Smith: Sure. So our specialized industries business sits within our, our middle market business. And just to define that middle market sort of means in, in the commercial banking, right? So anything from kind of a very early stage startup to a company that\u2019s up to 2 billion in top line revenue. So kind of a very wide, wide reit if you will. About half of that business is the industry business that I run. So I have 19 different industry teams, so bankers that are experts in those specific industries to provide obviously coverage to clients in those industries. And I would just say, I mean we are just a big believer in the, the, you know, better coverage and better that we can much better serve a client when our bankers have that expertise in, in terms of the industry. So we\u2019re kind of very big believers in, in industry expertise and kind of hyper segmentation in terms of covering companies at, at different stages and sizes in their lifecycle. So 19 different industries, innovation economy is basically a part of that. And we use that innovation economy kind of umbrella term to describe tech, early stage tech, life sciences, health tech, climate tech businesses, which are generally speaking, high growth VC backed businesses overall.\n\n00:12:02 [Speaker Changed] Well, let\u2019s talk a little bit about that. Yeah. I\u2019m familiar with a lot of the companies that VCs tend to back, but one of the things that we\u2019ve been noticing very obviously over the past few years is the amount of not venture income, but either private equity or private debt. How does that play out in the companies you\u2019re servicing?\n\n00:12:25 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Two really important trends. So I would say, so within the innovation economy, to your point, a lot of the companies tend to be VC backed, but there definitely is growing, growing sort of crossover into, into growth equity funds. I think in the middle market commercial banking business as a whole, there has been a ton of activity from the financial sponsor communities. So a ton of consolidation of those middle market businesses. And when you just look at sort of the levels of activity, like what are sponsors buying, it is within that middle market space. So that has definitely driven a lot of activity overall and something that we spend a lot of time talking about with our, with our clients. And then secondly, to your point on the private credit direct lending side, that also has been just a massive trend impacting sort of that part of the business with these companies looking for alternative sources of capital and direct lending being a great, a great alternative. That\u2019s in fact why we as a firm sort of developed our own direct lending capability a couple years ago. And I think that the great benefit of that is, again, we sort of pride ourselves on being kind of financing our product agnostic, right? We can do a traditional bank loan, we can do sort of a, a sort of, you know, public execution in the, in the public debt markets, or we can do a direct lending transaction, sort of whatever best fits the company\u2019s objectives, we can sort of do it all.\n\n00:13:36 [Speaker Changed] So, so let\u2019s talk about that because you know, part of your job description is delivering a cohesive banking experience to fast growing companies. So the two different divisions that you are running or head or co-head innovation economy and specialized industries obviously have to work together. What other divisions at JP Morgan are you collaborating with? Sure.\n\n00:13:59 [Speaker Changed] So I would say just generally we collaborate across the firm in everything that we do. So the commercial bank, just very broadly speaking, regardless of industry, regardless of what aspect of the commercial bank we\u2019re talking about, we\u2019re constantly working with our partners in the investment bank when companies need, obviously, excuse me, strategic capital raising m and a advisory, whatever the case may be. So we\u2019re constantly kind of working in conjunction with one another. And at the same time, we are often working with our asset management colleagues when companies have, you know, large cash balances that they need to invest and our private banking colleagues. And I think a good example of that is within the innovation economy kind of ecosystem overall where, because it is so interconnected, when you think about VC firms funding, you know, portfolio companies, the, those portfolio companies having founders, they\u2019re oftentimes, they\u2019re repeat founders. It\u2019s important that you can serve sort of the needs of that entire very interconnected ecosystem. So bankers on my team, on the innovation economy team are serving those portfolio companies, right? But at the same time, we\u2019re working with our colleagues in asset management and the private bank who bank the VC firms themselves and bank the, the VC partners and the founders for their private wealth needs. So our objective is to deliver sort of all the needs of the ecosystem. And that\u2019s why sort of by definition, we\u2019re always working across lines of business.\n\n00:15:17 [Speaker Changed] So really what you\u2019re saying is from a checking account up to a, a secondary financing private debt up to an IPO. And even beyond that, if, if there\u2019s an acquisition or a merger, you guys are a full service, not only commercial bank, but investment bank. There really isn\u2019t any space that you guys can\u2019t play in. You said and service Service exactly what a fast growing startup needs. Exactly.\n\n00:15:44 [Speaker Changed] You said it perfectly. And, and as I often like to say, we serve companies from startup to IPO and beyond. And so, you know, again, we believe we\u2019re really one of the few firms who can actually serve every need of these companies. And again, they\u2019re the, the founders themselves.\n\n00:15:58 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. So let\u2019s talk a little bit about middle market banking. You referred earlier the definition of middle market banking as up to 2 billion in in revenues,\n\n00:16:11 [Speaker Changed] Top line revenues. So,\n\n00:16:12 [Speaker Changed] So that\u2019s, this is not a little, these are not all little companies. That\u2019s a 2 billion in revenue is a pretty decent sized company.\n\n00:16:19 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. And again, we have teams focused on the smaller size, what we call emerging middle markets. So think about that as kind of 20 million to a hundred million in top line revenue, innovation, economy, doing the high growth, you know, VC backed startups, and then a bunch of different industries obviously within kind of that broader commercial banking universe and bankers that are focused simply on a hundred million in plus in top line revenue.\n\n00:16:41 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That\u2019s, that\u2019s really interesting. And we\u2019ve talked earlier about the role of venture banking in this. Where does that fit in? Where does venture capital fit into startups and where does venture banking fit in as companies get a little larger,\n\n00:16:56 [Speaker Changed] Generally speaking, and our objective is to really become the, the company\u2019s primary operating bank and trusted advisor from the very beginning. Right. And so as an example of that, we now have a startup banking team that actually covers companies at pre-seed and seed stage. So oftentimes could be before they\u2019ve even raised an institutional round of capital. And at that point in time, their needs are very sort of simple, if you will, right? They need a, they need a bank account, they need to pay their employees, they need to have a way to sort of collect funds, they may need a credit card. Just very simple banking needs. And then obviously as the companies continue to grow, those needs become more complex over time, including the need to either raise additional capital and whether that be from a venture capital fund or whoever that may, may be coming from, they may need some debt financing and sort of on and on and on in, in terms of what, what they ultimately need to achieve their objectives and kind of become the company that they want to become.\n\n00:17:48 [Speaker Changed] So what\u2019s the split between the companies you work with that are VC funded, that are private equity backed or just bootstrapped by the founders themselves?\n\n00:17:57 [Speaker Changed] So I would say, again, it vary, it would vary significantly depending on the industries that we\u2019re talking about. But if I, if just we focus on the innovation economy business specifically, the vast majority of those are gonna be VC backed, as I mentioned, of course, you know, sort of the, the crossover if you will between growth, equity and vc. The lines continue to get blurred, but I would say about 20 ish percent of the business is sort of PE-backed and the rest is VC-backed. Just broad, broad numbers\n\n00:18:21 [Speaker Changed] Bootstrapping still goes on or is that\n\n00:18:23 [Speaker Changed] It does again, and you see that, you know, certainly at, at, at the sort of pre-seed and seed stage and then, but I would say it\u2019s still, it\u2019s a minority, right? Of the larger companies within the innovation economy\n\n00:18:33 [Speaker Changed] Business. Yeah. So, so I\u2019m, I\u2019m thinking about their, their balance sheet. What\u2019s the split between how much is equity, how much is debt, or do you do a combination of debt and equity? What, what are, what does this look like\n\n00:18:44 [Speaker Changed] Today? Yeah, no, absolutely. So again, the, the whole purpose of of having a partner like JP Morgan is that a, we can sort of help the companies think through what the optimal capital structure is. And back to sort of the point of we\u2019re sort of product agnostic depending on what, what the company choose to do. Most of these companies that are high growth VC backed in what we call the innovation economy business, tend to still be pre profit, right? Sure. They\u2019re growing really rapidly, they\u2019re throwing everything back into the business in order to achieve scale. So for the most part, their use of debt is quite small. Usually some kind of small venture debt component. And we really want to work with those companies to think about when is the right time to put debt in their capital structure, depending again on where they are in sort of that life cycle. And depending on sort of what their cash burn looks like, how close they are to the next capital raise, what is the likelihood that they\u2019re actually gonna be able to raise the next round of capital. So it is a combination of both, but again, the majority of their capital structure is definitively gonna be equity given that they\u2019re cash burning companies, generally speaking. Right. Yeah.\n\n00:19:42 [Speaker Changed] And I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not involved in angel rounds or, you know, very early seed stuff. Which kind of leads me to, what sort of criteria does your team use when you\u2019re trying to figure out, hey, is this an early stage company that we want to have a banking relationship, can we be value add to them? Or are they still too novel, too green, no business, no revenue? Like how, how did Sure, what sort of criteria do you use?\n\n00:20:10 [Speaker Changed] Sure. So I, I think about it as, as quite as a pyramid. So there is a lot that we can do for companies across, you know, all stages of their lifecycle. But when you\u2019re talking about the very early stages back to they have fairly simplistic needs, right? And so we want to be able to bank and can bank as many of those companies as possible, assuming that, you know, there\u2019s, we don\u2019t find anything from a reputational risk perspective or something, or an industry that we think is challenging. But I think, again, becoming their primary operating bank, helping them optimize their working capital is sort of like the biggest challenge that these companies are not the biggest challenge, but one of the challenges that these companies face. So we can bank in terms of providing a bank account credit card, again, sort of payables receivables, many, many, many companies as we think about which of the companies we\u2019re gonna lend to, right?\n\n00:20:58 Which is a, a sort of the next round of the pyramid if you will. And that\u2019s, we obviously need to really assess their sustainability over time, their ability to raise the next round of capital. \u2019cause when you think about venture debt, that\u2019s really one of the gating factors. Is this company be able, gonna be able to raise the next round of capital? What\u2019s the cash burn look like to obviously get them to that next capital raise and how are they using debt to sort of extend that runway overall? So those are sort of the types of things that we\u2019re thinking about when we think about which of those companies that are sort of credit worthy for us to be lending to and obviously support them to again, get to the next round of capital.\n\n00:21:36 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. So I have a recollection of the era following the.com ramp up and then the, the crash in 2000. And it felt like a lot of the major banks had moved up market, like the middle market was kind of abandoned. So I, and, and lots of private equity seemed to have filled that gap. So I\u2019m kind of fascinated that a giant bank like JP Morgan is addressing that same market segment that generally people seem to feel like the bigger Wall Street banks have abandoned. You\u2019re telling me you\u2019re focusing in that space\n\n00:22:17 [Speaker Changed] A absolutely, because I think in all, in all, again, kind of of focus on two segments if you will, kind of just the broader commercial banking business and then the innovation economy business specifically, when you think about the broader commercial banking business, right? So not just high growth VC backed companies, but small businesses overall, right? There are 300,000, you know, small businesses across, across the country that represent, you know, 13 trillion in revenues and employ 40 million people, right? Right. So it is a massive part of the economy overall that we very much want to serve. And we\u2019ve been expanding that business quite substantially, mainly through sort of geographic expansion over the course of the last several years. We serve, you know, 32,000 middle market companies today across our commercial banks. So certainly again, there\u2019s back to a lot that we want to do and can do to support small business as kind of an engine of the economy overall that we very much think is a, is a, there\u2019s an opportunity there for us, but it\u2019s also sort of a, a responsibility, right?\n\n00:23:13 For us to serve those businesses. I think on the innovation economy side, just back to how, I mean when you look at the disruption going on across every industry today and the innovation, JP Morgan clearly wants to be there to support those founders with sort of the next innovative idea. And I always like to point to the fact that, you know, we\u2019ve been serving innovative companies literally for over 200 years. When you look back at our history, right? We supported Thomas Edison and the invention of the light bulb, the railroads, the automobile, like those were disruptors at that time. But I think on the, the innovation economy business specifically, when we first started, I\u2019ll give you a little history of the business. When we first sort of started a dedicated focus, so we had always served early stage tech companies in the commercial bank, but just by sort of a local banker that didn\u2019t have any expertise in tech, right?\n\n00:23:58 That covered all industries. So back in 20 16, 20 17, we put in place sort of a dedicated team of bankers at that point in time, I would say we primarily did, we, we were very good in terms of our capabilities at serving, let\u2019s call it kind of series C and beyond, right? And when I came into this role, we very much noticed that a founder, right? And for their company would walk into a Chase branch, they\u2019d open a, a bank account, and then they would quickly leave that chase branch and move to one of our competitors who were very good at serving early stage, high growth, early stage VC backed companies. And then they\u2019d come back to us at sort of series C right? Generalization. But so when I came into this role, sort of said, what are we missing, right? In that very early stage in terms of our capabilities, like let\u2019s skip that part where they leave the JP Morgan sort of franchise, right? And really what we were missing was sort of a very simplified treasury, what we call treasury kind of payments bundle for companies to manage working capital, a simple digital platform for earlier stage companies and a venture debt capability. And that\u2019s what we really built out sort of from kind of 20 17, 20 18 over the course of the past several years. So that we had best in class capabilities, both for early stage companies as well as late stage companies where everybody thinks about JP Morgan is serving later stage.\n\n00:25:14 [Speaker Changed] So you mentioned earlier that you\u2019re expanding geographically, we\u2019ll talk about international in a few minutes, but let\u2019s stay in the United States for a bit. I think of JP Morgan down on Wall Street, very New York based. What geographies have you been expanding to? What parts of the country seem to be very fast growing these days? Sure.\n\n00:25:35 [Speaker Changed] Well, so I would just say today our commercial banking business, you know, is in the 85, you know, fastest growing top sort of MSAs across the country. We have 125 offices across the country, 2000 plus bankers across the country. A big part of that expansion over really the last decade has been sort of California and the west coast overall, where we, prior to the WAMU acquisition didn\u2019t have a ton of sort of like retail presence and or sort of boots on the ground there. So that\u2019s accounted for a lot of that geographic expansion as well as, you know, expansion into the southeast and sort of other states in, in the west, obviously sort of moving from what historically, you know, decades and decades ago was more of a kind of east coast dominated business. And that\u2019s what\u2019s accounted for a lot of the growth within the business as a whole.\n\n00:26:20 [Speaker Changed] What, what about down south places like Charlotte or Nashville or Texas or Florida?\n\n00:26:25 [Speaker Changed] A absolutely, I mean, when you look at, again, kind of depends on the industry, but when you look at the innovation economy business and kind of where some of the newer markets are from a VC funding perspective, you are seeing a lot of growth in, you know, the, the Phillies of the world, the dcs of the world, you know, San Diego. I mean certainly there\u2019s still like a huge, a huge concentration in kind of, you know, the Bay area and then kind of New York, Boston area. But there are cities, Miami\u2019s a good example for our healthcare business. Nashville is, you know, has exploded over the past several years. Yeah. So again, depending on the industry, it depends on sort of where our concentration of bankers are. But you know, back to, that\u2019s why we are in 125 cities across the country.\n\n00:27:09 [Speaker Changed] Huh. So let\u2019s talk international. You spent, was it a year in London? Is that three, three years. Three years, yes. Oh, so you are an old hand at there you go dealing with Europe. So let\u2019s talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening in the UK and what\u2019s going on in Europe. How, how do you look at those markets? Can, can you play in those spaces? Tell us a little bit about what the work is like there.\n\n00:27:28 [Speaker Changed] Sure. So I would say from a commercial banking perspective, we definitely support companies globally. And I do think that\u2019s, again, one of JP Morgan\u2019s competitive advantages. As earlier stage companies are looking to expand internationally, we can support them across, you know, basically any market they\u2019re gonna, they they\u2019re going to across, you know, both AMEA and apac. So yes, we support companies there and then we have teams on the ground in, in Europe and Asia, et cetera, that are supporting early stage companies that are headquarters in, in Europe and and apac and then their expansion into the us. So kind of doing it both ways, inbound and outbound. And again, I think that that\u2019s something that with our long history of operating in these various jurisdictions, helping to advise companies on sort of the right strategy as they think about those international expansions. Huh,\n\n00:28:15 [Speaker Changed] Really, really interesting. What percentage of your business is international? I can\u2019t imagine JP Morgan feels like it\u2019s so dominant in the us What\u2019s it, what\u2019s the perception like o overseas? How is it?\n\n00:28:27 [Speaker Changed] So I would say for our commercial banking business, so let me separate this out a moment. So again, the commercial banking business of the US is serving US headquartered companies, but when they have a European sub or an Asian sub, that clearly is a smaller percentage of the company\u2019s overall revenue. Sure. So a smaller percentage of like the revenue that we would earn as well, but we\u2019re supporting them globally. The commercial banking sort of build out in Europe and in Asia for bankers on the ground supporting European and Asian headquarter companies is a newer effort, newer over the past seven or eight years. So it\u2019s not as robust in terms of our robust as the wrong word, it\u2019s not as far along right, right. As our business in, in the\n\n00:29:13 [Speaker Changed] Us I mean clearly, clearly well established here for hundreds of years,\n\n00:29:17 [Speaker Changed] Hundreds of years. And we\u2019ve been in Europe and Asia for hundreds of years, really from an investment banking perspective, hundreds of years is maybe a strong word, but for many, many, many decades from an investment banking perspective. But the build out of the commercial bank supporting smaller size companies in those markets is, is newer seven or seven or eight years ago.\n\n00:29:33 [Speaker Changed] And, and that\u2019s a white space that\u2019s gotta be wide open now, right?\n\n00:29:36 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely, absolutely. And and again, we\u2019re finding great traction because there is so much, obviously as we all are well aware, economies and companies operate in such a global fashion today that a company sitting in Europe obviously has generally speaking plans to expand in other parts of the globe, the US being a huge market, particularly across tech and consumer facing businesses, et cetera. So that, that connectivity is important. And\n\n00:29:57 [Speaker Changed] You said earlier from from checking to IPO, how do you think about the IPO market, which has been so quiet the past few years, we really haven\u2019t seen a lot of companies coming public. How do you view this, when might that change and, and how does this impact your business? Sure.\n\n00:30:17 [Speaker Changed] So we are definitely optimistic on the IPO market this year. And I think even, you know, in 2024 I saw a significant uptick in issuance versus 2023. Obviously we were coming off a low base, but we saw about 33 billion in IPO volume in 2024. We think that that could double this year, you know, just given I think a stable backdrop, more kind of confidence all around the markets. We\u2019ve also just seen a more stable, you know, US economy obviously so far, you know, knock on wood feels like we, we sort of took a soft landing right in the US we now have rates on the decline, which is supportive of the IPO market. We\u2019ll sort of see if that, you know, how that kind of plays out over the course of the year. And then I think, you know, the expectation of sort of double digit earnings growth in the coming year is also very supportive of the equity market. So we do think you\u2019re gonna see a lot more activity in the IPO market this year. And obviously there\u2019s just a ton of supply that\u2019s built up over the past couple years of, as companies have stayed private longer and waiting for a better window to access that IPO market.\n\n00:31:20 [Speaker Changed] So we\u2019re recording this at the end of January. I don\u2019t recall seeing anybody\u2019s forecast for the year ahead saying, Hey, really inexpensive AI from China, deep seek is gonna completely disrupt everything. How do you look at the, not just the technological disruption that we\u2019re all experiencing, but the incredible pace as to how rapid everything is advancing. How do you think about this and how does that impact the day job? How does it impact the work?\n\n00:31:51 [Speaker Changed] Sure. So clearly, you know, just talking about deep seek specifically obviously just a huge impact on the equity markets. You know, as you saw a lot of, a lot of some of the, the larger names trading down significantly. We did see a rebound sort of the, the following day, which was, which was beneficial. I do think, you know, AI is obviously gonna be continued to be a big story over the course of 2025. There\u2019s also just a tremendous amount of capital that needs to be raised to kind of support that industry overall. And so I I do think like back to sort of the comments about sort of stable macroeconomic backdrop rates, declining, all of that will be supportive of the broader IPO market and the ability to access those markets. Yes, we\u2019re gonna kind of continue to see volatility with some of these, these surprises, like the deep sake example, but, but it, it hasn\u2019t really changed our view, our very constructive view on, on the market going forward.\n\n00:32:47 [Speaker Changed] Let\u2019s talk a little bit about some of your thoughts on, on leadership at the bank and, and long-term strategy. If we go back five or six years, you are a managing director and head of specialized industries. What types of firms were you working with then? And are you still working with the same firms or has your portfolio widened since then?\n\n00:33:10 [Speaker Changed] Well, I would say the portfolio has widened in the sense that we\u2019ve continued to add various industries. So specialized industries, I think I mentioned before, it\u2019s 19 different industries that we cover. Give\n\n00:33:19 [Speaker Changed] Us some examples. Cover,\n\n00:33:20 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So that, that spans a, a very wide remit. So some of our very mature businesses, for instance, our government business supporting states and municipalities and school districts across the country, we\u2019ve been doing, excuse me, doing that since, you know, JP Morgan sort of was founded. So the government business are not-for-profit. Healthcare, higher ed and nonprofit business, again, two very mature businesses. We also have, you know, beverage, food and ag, our m and c business supporting some of the subsidiaries media communications and di digital infrastructure, very hot sector right now in terms of the, the huge need for data centers and capital for data centers overall, the innovation economy business, again, as I mentioned, sort of part of all that. So those are some examples of the industries that, that fall within that, that remit. So again, when we first started specialized industries, I\u2019m not gonna remember the exact number, but we probably had five industries within, within that, right? And so we\u2019ve just continued to build out that dedicated expertise over the course of the past several years, which we\u2019ve just found great success in.\n\n00:34:17 [Speaker Changed] So how do you assess risk when you\u2019re rolling into a new sector or specialized industry when you\u2019re working in a space for a while, you kind of learn what, what the, you know, where the mines are laid when you move into a new space. How do you, how do you approach that? Yeah,\n\n00:34:34 [Speaker Changed] Well I would just say it\u2019s not as if we weren\u2019t banking companies in each of those industries before. It\u2019s simply that we did not have dedicated bankers that only did that, right? So back to this is why we very much believe in, it\u2019s been proven out in terms of the growth that we\u2019ve seen in, in sort of the specialized industry\u2019s business. So we sort of focus in on the sectors where we think it makes a difference for the banker to have that industry expertise. Keep in mind we, we partner with the investment bank on the m and a advisory and strategic capital raising, and they\u2019re all industry focused, right? But does the commercial banker need that industry expertise? Is there something very different about the credit risk associated with those industries that, that that banker expertise helps and that we need sort of dedicated credit teams, again, with the, with the focus on those specific industries.\n\n00:35:20 Is there something different about the product and solution set for those companies that would require us to have that dedicated focus back to kind of the innovation economy business? As I was saying earlier, we didn\u2019t have the early stage capabilities that we needed, you know, seven, eight years ago. And that\u2019s what we, and it was a very kind of bespoke to those high growth companies and the challenges that that we face, that they face that led us to kind of build out those digital capabilities and bundled solutions. So that\u2019s a good example of why we felt like we needed to build that as an industry.\n\n00:35:50 [Speaker Changed] So it\u2019s kind of fascinating that you\u2019re serving clients who are rapidly innovating, expanding into spaces that wholly unforeseen. How do you keep up with that? How do you make sure that you are innovative and cutting edge and how do you build this when it, it\u2019s almost as if your clients are outpacing, you know, the rest of the market.\n\n00:36:13 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely, and I would say that is one of the best parts of my job is meeting with founders all day long and really obviously hearing about their businesses and, and what they are doing to kind of disrupt industries, new technologies. And that is extraordinarily rewarding in terms of hearing about that and how we can help support that growth overall. It is very different meeting with, again, kinda back to my, my earlier background, spending time in debt capital markets, you\u2019re basically covering Fortune 500 companies. It\u2019s very, which is its own unique circumstances and, and those companies have their own challenges, but it\u2019s very different speaking to the treasurer CFO or CEO of Fortune 500 company, right. Than a founder, right? Like there\u2019s just, it\u2019s a very different, different\n\n00:36:59 [Speaker Changed] Focus, different priorities. Exactly. Different experience\n\n00:37:02 [Speaker Changed] And skillset sets. So that, that again is sort of the, the, the most fun part of my job is being able to interact with all of those founders and hear about sort of the technology to come.\n\n00:37:10 [Speaker Changed] So I\u2019m, I\u2019m intrigued at the, about the work you did in debt capital markets, especially when you were in Europe for three years. How, how did, what are the major differences between the way we manage debt capital markets and the way they do? Is it structural? Tell, tell us about, you know, why is it that, are they very similar or are they different?\n\n00:37:32 [Speaker Changed] Well, so a couple things I would say that just one in terms of how we think about co covering companies and, and d markets in the US we\u2019re, we\u2019re organized by industry team in Europe for obvious obviously reasons we\u2019re, we\u2019re organized by country team given language differences. So that again, was something that I very much enjoyed was sitting back to in DC you in the trading floor environment, I would have my UK team over here, my Germany team, my Italy team. So you know, everyone\u2019s speaking different languages. I kept thinking I was gonna learn five languages by osmosis. That did not work. So unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. But that was, that was a great experience overall I would, you know, the European debt ca capital markets are, tend to be a little bit more volatile than the us It\u2019s also because they are a lot smaller, right?\n\n00:38:15 In terms of just the total volume, the investor base that sort of supports those markets all around. And so that\u2019s one of the major differences. What I would say is for larger global companies, having access to that European market has been quite advantageous, both from a capacity perspective, if they were running up against capacity constraints for a very frequent issuer, obviously in the us and two, just from a cost of funding perspective. So over the last several years, given the, the divergence in interest rates between the US and Europe, for many companies it\u2019s actually been cheaper to issue bonds or, you know, access the debt markets in Europe than it has been in the us right? Interest u US interest rates were higher. So that\u2019s obviously just a great alternative, right? For companies when they need to access enormous amounts of capital and or are obviously very focused on sort of what the, what the most advantageous cost is. So,\n\n00:39:08 [Speaker Changed] I know you\u2019re not an economist, so I\u2019m I\u2019m not gonna ask you that question, but it just feels like Europe cannot get out of its own way for, I don\u2019t know, past five years, 10 years, go back to Brexit and, and nearly Brexit, what\u2019s going on that Europe seems to be almost structurally lagging the US and having such difficulty finding its footing.\n\n00:39:32 [Speaker Changed] Well, I\u2019m also not an expert on politics, so I\u2019m not gonna comment on that. \u2019cause I think there\u2019s, there\u2019s something to be said there, but what I would say from sort of a structural perspective is I think probably the, one of the bigger differences today is demographics where kind of working age population in Europe is declining. I think it\u2019s still growing modestly in the US and obviously that will turn in the US at some point in time. But so that, that has been sort of one issue in Europe. I think the post COVI recovery in Europe was a lot more challenging primarily because of the Russia, Ukraine war and sort of the energy crisis that they faced given a lot of their energy was coming from, or energy supply was coming from, from Russia. So that had a very different impact in Europe than it did in, in the US overall.\n\n00:40:17 If you look at Germany, obviously the largest, you know, economy in Europe, it\u2019s very still sort of heavily manufacturing based. Higher interest rates have really had hurt to manufacturing, global manufacturing. And so that\u2019s had a bigger impact I think on, on Germany with those manufacturers operating globally. So those are some of the things that I would point to. And you know, there\u2019s just never been the same labor productivity across Europe as there has been in the US and, and quite frankly, just the support for innovation and tech, right? And new technology. And I think that\u2019s just had a big impact back to Germany\u2019s heavily manufacturing based, right? The US probably less so\n\n00:40:54 [Speaker Changed] Because we\u2019re more service oriented, is that the thinking\n\n00:40:56 [Speaker Changed] More service oriented? And I think again, you don\u2019t have the same, I think a lot of countries in Europe are looking to put in place policies to better incentivize some of the technological development. But I mean, you don\u2019t have a Bay area type, right? Right. I mean, you, you have little pockets of that kind of concept, right? Where you have sort of this ecosystem coming together to, to disrupt and innovate and, and support new technology. But there\u2019s not, there\u2019s nothing as sort of big as the Bay area in, in Europe,\n\n00:41:24 [Speaker Changed] But you do have world class manufacturing throughout Europe and I I think absolutely. Yeah. Of Mercedes, Porsche, BMW in Germany, you think of all the, i i I guess it really doesn\u2019t scale watchmaking and things like that, but there are some really high-end companies that are incredibly successful. Are, are they just the exceptions? What is it I\u2019m trying to conceptualize. Sure.\n\n00:41:49 [Speaker Changed] But I also think it\u2019s, it\u2019s much more fragmented obviously than the US market with, with each different country, with its own, own rules and regulations and Sure. And you know, some, some sort of more nationalist policies than others. And I think that just has an impact on their ability to kind of dominate. And we\u2019re talking about Europe as if it\u2019s one thing, but, but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not,\n\n00:42:06 [Speaker Changed] Right. So you\u2019re saying really it\u2019s, it is structural, it\u2019s not so, so the combination of these structural challenges, relatively high interest rate, less productivity gains and a focus that\u2019s less service oriented, more manufacturing oriented\n\n00:42:24 [Speaker Changed] Demographics\n\n00:42:25 [Speaker Changed] And demographics. Yeah. So the people who have been waiting for, hey, you know, Europe is gonna catch up, it\u2019s gonna mean revert any second. That doesn\u2019t seem to be in the imminent cards anytime soon.\n\n00:42:39 [Speaker Changed] I don\u2019t think that\u2019s in the 2025 cards, let\u2019s put it that way.\n\n00:42:42 [Speaker Changed] Okay. Hey, that\u2019s fair. That\u2019s perfectly fair thing. I wanna talk a little bit about some of the work you\u2019ve done on women in banking. You were on the Women on the Move podcast and one of the things you said that struck me was women don\u2019t have as robust of a network as, as men do explain.\n\n00:43:07 [Speaker Changed] So that was, that was a little bit of a generalization probably, but I think what, what I meant by that was if women tend to stick to, because I, I think often earlier in their career, and probably I did the same thing early on, that you stick to sort of the women\u2019s network that you develop, right? Right. And there\u2019s a lot of sort of women\u2019s networking events. I\u2019ll speak for, you know, financial services specifically. If you only stick to that network, there\u2019s still a lot fewer women in sort of banking or pick, pick many industries, right? Than there are men. And so that limits kind of that network overall. And so I think like important that you spending time with people across the organization, picking mentors across the organization, networking across the organization to make sure that you are developing the same robust network that sort of some of your male colleagues would, would already be doing.\n\n00:43:55 [Speaker Changed] So I also read you value and prioritize mentorship. What, how do you approach this at, at your job? We\u2019ll get to questions about who your mentors were, but do you have mentees? Are you, are you practicing what you preach?\n\n00:44:11 [Speaker Changed] Yes, I and I, I very much take that as a, as a serious responsibility and sort of part of my day job. You know, we have various, I would say organized programs and then there\u2019s more informal, you know, mentor mentorship programs. And I think both are important, but I think over the years, you know, making sure that all of the senior individuals are sort of participating in those mentorship sponsorship programs, giving younger people sort of the opportunity to, to learn from someone else about their career. And again, sort of doing the informal mentoring. I think back to the JP Morgan culture, I think it\u2019s just very endemic there. Someone reaches out, you know, to have a cup of coffee with you, you, you go do that, right? And it\u2019s just sort of something that\u2019s expected and something that sort of I grew up with, if you will. And so certainly something that I again take very seriously.\n\n00:45:01 [Speaker Changed] So when I first started this podcast, I, I wanna say almost 11 years ago was very hard finding women in senior leadership roles and having them come on as guests. That has become much easier. I\u2019m curious how you see the industry as as once male dominated. It\u2019s still mostly male dominated, but it feels like it\u2019s improving somewhat. What, what do you, what\u2019s your perspective?\n\n00:45:31 [Speaker Changed] I do think that a lot of progress has been made overall, I think, you know, JP Morgan, not to toot our own horn, but I think is a great example for the industry where you look at, you know, our operating committee, which are the, the individuals that report directly to Jamie, you know, it is heavily female job.\n\n00:45:45 [Speaker Changed] Jamie, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not familiar with who, who was that?\n\n00:45:48 [Speaker Changed] There, there are many, many females on the operating committee. So we\u2019ve done a great job there and I think that that\u2019s kind of, you know, filtered down throughout the organization. So yes, I do think it has, has improved substantially. I do still think there\u2019s a lot of challenges, particularly at that sort of vp, late VP early ed level, early executive director level. A lot of times when people are having sort of their first, their first children and sort of making sure that we\u2019re providing this a supportive environment that they\u2019re able to obviously, you know, come back to work as, as they would like to. But yes, I think significant progress has been made, but I think that is a very intentional effort back to kind of understanding why if we are losing female employees or diverse employees, why that is. In the same way that we wanna understand why we\u2019re losing any employee, right? Any talented employee, we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t wanna lose. But I think you have to be just very intentional about measuring progress and, and understanding what the challenges are and if there\u2019s anything that you can do or should be doing to have a more sort of accommodative environment and inclusive environment. So\n\n00:46:49 [Speaker Changed] I have a question later about advice to recent college grads, but as long as we\u2019re talking about women in banking, let\u2019s stay focused on that here. What advice do you have for any young woman who wants to become part of the financial sector or, or banking industry?\n\n00:47:08 [Speaker Changed] I would just say really taking advantage of friends, colleagues that you know, your network peers to understand all aspects of the industry. And I, you know, that\u2019s hard to do sometimes when you\u2019re in college and you\u2019re not sort of sitting in the organization. But I do think, and this is not a commentary on females versus males, but just sort of back to the networking point, you, you have kind of a natural advantage if your, your parent was an investment banker or a lawyer or Right. That dealt with, with sort of the banking industry or, you know, pick, pick another sort of adjacent profession. And so, you know, those individuals know the right questions to ask, are more aware of the opportunities across the firm. It\u2019s not just investment banking, there\u2019s lots of other things we do at do at JP Morgan or, or any affirm. So I think just making sure that you are figuring out how to kind of gather that information and, and ask all of those questions so that you\u2019re a little more educated coming in about sort of what the opportunities are overall.\n\n00:48:09 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really interesting. So let me throw you a curve ball question. We talked earlier, not only about your ballet at age four, but dancing professionally for three years. You\u2019re a member of the board of trustees for American Ballet Theater. That\u2019s the pinnacle of dance in America. Tell us a little bit about the organization, how you found your way to it. Like what, what are you doing with them?\n\n00:48:35 [Speaker Changed] Sure. So I have been on the board since 2009, so Oh wow.\n\n00:48:40 [Speaker Changed] That\u2019s 15 plus years.\n\n00:48:41 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so a long time. So again, American Ballet Theater, one of the greatest ballet companies in the world based here in New York, officially designated by Congress is America\u2019s National Ballet Company. Huh. And actually, as of January of this year, I\u2019m the new chair of the board of A BT, which is super exciting. Congratulations. But, you know, the board obviously has, its, its basic sort of governance functions, but, you know, we spend a lot of time helping with fundraising for the organization and helping provide, you know, expertise where each individual has it. Any nonprofit obviously has a much more limited sort of staff overall. So if there\u2019s people on the board that have real estate expertise or finance expertise or HR expertise, that is very valuable to the organization as a whole. So there\u2019s always sort of special projects that, that we, you know, sort of participate in from that perspective. But a but a big chunk of what the board does is really making sure people are aware of a BT helping with fundraising, helping attract new donors, helping attract and develop new audience members. Huh.\n\n00:49:43 [Speaker Changed] Really, really interesting. Have past board members and or chair people been former professional ballet dancers? Or is this unusual? There\u2019s\n\n00:49:55 [Speaker Changed] Always a few, but certainly the majority of people on the board don\u2019t have a background in dance. And, and as, as I always remind everybody, I call it the separation between church and state. The board is there to sort of help with the business of running the ballet company. They have no input whatsoever to anything artistic, which is why it\u2019s not required that you have any sort of background in.\n\n00:50:14 [Speaker Changed] But I\u2019m curious if there have been previous chair people who were professional ballet dancers\n\n00:50:20 [Speaker Changed] That I would have. I, I don\u2019t think so, but I\u2019m not a hundred percent possible. All right. But I don\u2019t think so our previous chair who retired at the end of last year, his sister danced with the company for many years and that\u2019s really how he became involved and obviously, you know, very passionate about the ballet\n\n00:50:36 [Speaker Changed] Really, it, it\u2019s one of those fascinating things that just, I don\u2019t see on people\u2019s resumes all that often and I had no idea you were chairman, but it, it\u2019s really fascinating. Alright, so while I still have you, let\u2019s jump to our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests. Speaking of, of entertainment. Let\u2019s start with what are you streaming these days? What\u2019s keeping you entertained? It could be Netflix, podcast, whatever. What, what, what are you enjoying these days? So\n\n00:51:02 [Speaker Changed] First I would say I am sort of an avid reader. I was talking with a colleague on my way over here. Everybody consumes information differently. I consume it better reading, I think, than always on the same way, always listening right?\n\n00:51:13 [Speaker Changed] On\n\n00:51:14 [Speaker Changed] The same way. So I, I\u2019m sort of very religious about getting through The Economist and the New Yorker every week. And I won\u2019t let myself read the next issue of The Economist until I finish the first one. So even if I\u2019m behind, I\u2019m I, I I\n\n00:51:25 [Speaker Changed] Do that. Right. I, I\u2019m, I\u2019m in 1986. If I followed that there rule.\n\n00:51:29 [Speaker Changed] Okay, there you go. I might have to get that up at some point. I am currently streaming, I guess the second season of the diplomat, which I\u2019m very much enjoying. I so good.\n\n00:51:38 [Speaker Changed] I\n\n00:51:38 [Speaker Changed] Love the political actions thrillers, but I think I\u2019m running out of them \u2019cause I\u2019ve watched all of them at this\n\n00:51:43 [Speaker Changed] Point. So I Lion s have you seen\n\n00:51:44 [Speaker Changed] That? Oh no, I haven\u2019t seen that. Okay.\n\n00:51:46 [Speaker Changed] So a little more intelligence community slash tip of the spear. Okay. Okay. But you know, the same sort of back and forth layers of intrigue and, but I really enjoyed the diplomat. I I thought that was fascinating. And then, what was it, secretary of State was the other one.\n\n00:52:06 [Speaker Changed] Madam Secretary. Madam\n\n00:52:07 [Speaker Changed] Secretary. That same concept.\n\n00:52:09 [Speaker Changed] I will admit, I\u2019ve watched it a couple times.\n\n00:52:11 [Speaker Changed] Oh, oh really? I thought it was,\n\n00:52:12 [Speaker Changed] She\u2019s great. Yes, exactly. I think it\u2019s a good pick me up. Particularly when partisan politics are, you know, depressing everyone. It\u2019s good. It\u2019s, it\u2019s just a happy, there\u2019s always a happy ending. I appreciate\n\n00:52:23 [Speaker Changed] That. Anytime there\u2019s, you have an ability to go to a space you\u2019re wholly unfamiliar with and be challenged. It\u2019s not just entertaining, but it, you know, clears the cobweb out little bit.\n\n00:52:32 [Speaker Changed] A bit. Exactly.\n\n00:52:33 [Speaker Changed] So, really interesting. So we talked about you as a mentor. Who are your mentors who helped shape your career?\n\n00:52:42 [Speaker Changed] So I would say I feel very lucky when I was, most of my career, when I was in debt capital markets, I worked for a, a woman who ran DCM at the time. And then she went on to do different things at the firm who was very much a sponsor mentor for me overall. And has just, you know, over time she\u2019s retired now from JP Morgan, but sort of, you know, become a friend. But I think that\u2019s where I really, I think learned and embraced kind of just this concept of attracting talent, retaining talent, helping to kind of bring up the next generation of women is a responsibility of senior people. And she really demonstrated that. And, and certainly, I, I took that to heart.\n\n00:53:25 [Speaker Changed] So since you are a reader, let\u2019s talk about books. What are your favorites and what are you reading right now?\n\n00:53:31 [Speaker Changed] So favorites are hard, but what I\u2019m, what I\u2019m reading right now. So I actually just finished over the holidays. I tend to alternate between fiction and nonfiction. I do a little\n\n00:53:42 [Speaker Changed] Of both. Okay. I get that\n\n00:53:42 [Speaker Changed] Because I think both are important. I finished Chasing Hope, the Nicholas Christoff book. He\u2019s a foreign correspondent for The Times, which is interesting. I finished a biography of Alex Monki, who\u2019s a, a choreographer. I don\u2019t think many, many listening to this podcast may find that book interesting. But I did a new fiction by Michael Cunningham called Day. So those were all, all really good. Some of my favorite authors, Isabella Enig, Dave Edgar, that\u2019s what I would\n\n00:54:13 [Speaker Changed] Say. Edgar is kind of funny if I, if we\u2019re talking about he same guy, right? He\u2019s\n\n00:54:17 [Speaker Changed] Kind funny and he has funny titles, which I love. Heartbreaking work is staggering. Genius. Yes. One of his first books. Love that book. Yeah.\n\n00:54:23 [Speaker Changed] So we\u2019re down to our last two questions and this is a broader question that I asked earlier. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either banking or finance?\n\n00:54:39 [Speaker Changed] I think to make sure that they embrace risk taking. And I say that because maybe, maybe just because I myself maybe am a little bit risk averse, but I think over the course of your career you have the opportunity often to do many different things. And a lot of times people are afraid to sort of leave their current group and do something different and it just opens up a whole world of possibilities. So I think sort of taking a little bit more risk than you might naturally do is always good advice.\n\n00:55:11 [Speaker Changed] And when you have no spouse, no mortgage, no kids, that\u2019s the time easy to do it, to fall on your face. \u2019cause you get up, dust yourself off and, and start over again. It\u2019s funny how when you\u2019re a few years past being young, that\u2019s obvious, but at the time it doesn\u2019t feel that way.\n\n00:55:28 [Speaker Changed] Well, and it feels like such a big risk. Oh my\n\n00:55:30 [Speaker Changed] God. So risky. Right, exactly. And our final question, what do you know about the world of banking and investment and growth companies today that would\u2019ve been really helpful 25 or so years ago?\n\n00:55:43 [Speaker Changed] That\u2019s a really good question.\n\n00:55:45 [Speaker Changed] And it\u2019s not, I should have bought Nvidia when it was 50 cents. It\u2019s like what philosophically would\u2019ve been useful to know that you eventually figured it out?\n\n00:55:55 [Speaker Changed] I think because I started in the investment bank and then by definition was really working with primarily larger size companies, I think it, I, you know, as I kind of mentioned earlier, understanding how different it is and, and the fact that you have the ability to make an even bigger difference for a smaller size company that, that needs that sort of trusted advisor even more. I think it would be, would be sort of good to know, right? Because it is, I think financial services overall, you have the ability to take on a lot more responsibility at an early age than other industries. But I think again, the ability to kind of influence and advise an early stage company is, is just incredibly rewarding given the limited resources staff that they have.\n\n00:56:38 [Speaker Changed] Melissa, this has been absolutely fascinating.

The company is slated to reveal its earnings on April 11, 2025.

Tamara Beckwith\n\nRoy Messer, a 57-year-old health insurance broker from Charlotte, and his business partner Bill Rice, also 57, said they were shocked by the penny-pinching from the bank run by Jamie Dimon and took matters into their own hands.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe for such an amount of money that they wouldn\u2019t want to do the right thing. There is no doubt that her husband would have wanted that money to go to her and his kids,\u201d Rice said.\n\n\u201cI imagine that for Jamie Dimon, this is like a nickel falling out of his pocket. I would like to believe that he just doesn\u2019t know (about this).\u201d\n\nMesser, who served in the Marine Corps between 1986 and 1989, said he was \u201ctouched\u201d by Silverberg\u2019s story and that wiring her the money was \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know her and I could have very easily just turned the page. But when something like that reaches out and grabs you, I looked at it and thought: \u2018What if that was my mother?'\u201d he told The Post.\n\nSilverberg was left stunned by their gesture, saying it \u201crestored my faith in mankind.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this crazy world we live in, it is remarkable that such kindness also exists. I am flabbergasted at their extreme generosity,\u201d she told The Post.\n\n4 Messer and Rice learned of Silverberg\u2019s ordeal after reading The Post\u2019s story in December. Courtesy of Roy Messer\n\nJPMorgan declined to comment, but a senior source inside the bank said the rules governing its pension fund ban any exceptions from being carved out.\n\nJPMorgan insiders told The Post in December that the company would never back down after Grinches at the bank denied Silverberg\u2019s repeated pleas to hand over her husband Mel\u2019s $331-a-month pension pot.\n\nAccording to Silverberg, a former government administrator, the fully vested cash pile is worth an estimated $53,000.\n\n4 Jaime Dimon CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nBut JPMorgan bean counters said Mel, a former system analyst with Chase Manhattan Bank until 1979, failed to fill in the necessary forms before he unexpectedly died at the age of 43 from multiple organ failure in 1988.\n\nChase Manhattan went on to merge with JPMorgan in 2000. The Wall Street giant posted record profits of $58.5 billion last year, with Dimon raking in $39 million in compensation.\n\nThe Ronald Reagan administration passed the Retirement Equity Act in 1984 so spouses like Silverberg would automatically benefit if their loved ones died.\n\n4 The late Mel Silverberg (left) with Elaine and two of their daughters in 1973. Provided to the NY Post\n\nJPMorgan insists it wrote to Mel on three separate occasions asking him to elect survivor coverage after he stepped down. His widow says none of that correspondence ever arrived at the family home.\n\nShe said pension managers can only dig up documentation that they say proves they contacted Mel in 1990 \u2014 two years after he died.\n\nSilverberg even once enlisted US Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and ex-Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY) of the Bronx to convince the firm to change its mind, to no avail.",

            "content": "Shares of Southwest Airlines (LUV) slid 2% after JPMorgan downgraded the airline to an Underweight rating from Neutral, effectively a cut from Hold to Sell. Three-star analyst Jamie Baker said that the stock\u2019s valuation was too high, and that he \u201cremained convinced that Southwest\u2019s best margin and ROIC [return on invested capital] days lie in the past.\u201d Although the stock has declined around 50% from its April 2021 heyday, it\u2019s rallied about 40% since hitting a low in October 2023.\n\nSetting an unchanged price target of $25, Baker said the stock\u2019s \u201cvaluation premium can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d He said the combination of Southwest\u2019s \u201csurging valuation premium\u201d and its desire to rebalance ratings following the addition of Sun Country for the downgrade.\n\nBaker said that in terms of its valuation no other airline comes \u201canywhere close.\u201d LUV trades at 13 times forecast 2026 earnings, in comparison seven times forecast earnings for Delta Air Lines (DAL) or the 6x at United Airlines (UAL) and 4.5x at American Airlines (AAL). In terms of low-cost carriers, Alaska Air trades on a forward price\u2014to-earnings (PE) multiple of nine while Frontier (ULCC) trades on a forward PE of about seven.\n\nLUV Turning Things Around\n\nSouthwest is in the middle of a turnaround strategy under the gaze of activist investor Elliott Management, which owns a 9% stake in the budget carrier. For the JPMorgan analyst there is however a difficulty in finding other buyers of the stock. \u201cAside from Elliott, we\u2019re hard-pressed to understand who the incremental buyer may be,\u201d he said.\n\nAs part of its turnaround the company last month said it is cutting about 15% of corporate jobs, or about 1,750 positions, in an unprecedented move to cut costs, according to CEO Bob Jordan.\n\n\u201cThis decision is unprecedented in our 53-year history, and change requires that we make difficult decisions,\u201d Jordan said in a news release. \u201cWe are at a pivotal moment as we transform Southwest Airlines into a leaner, faster, and more agile organization.\u201d\n\nLast year it announced plans to boost profits by offering pricier seats with extra legroom and end open seating on its planes, in what was seen as the biggest shakeup at the airline in over 50 years.\n\nIs LUV a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nOverall, analysts tend to agree with Baker, with Wall Street having a Hold consensus rating on LUV stock, based on four Buys, seven Holds and five Sells. The average LUV price target of $32.66 implies about 5% upside.\n\nSee more LUV analyst ratings\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Under pressure from the Trump administration, JPMorgan is continuing to rework and reword its commitment to the controversial Diversity, Equity and Inclusion system of hiring and promotion, including possibly an overhaul of its flashy displays of DEI commitments featured on the company\u2019s website, the Post has learned.\n\nBut my guess \u2014 and the guess of people in Washington and on Wall Street following this issue \u2014 is that it won\u2019t be enough to satisfy the courts, the public\u2019s demands for a color-blind meritocracy and the Trump administration\u2019s desires to roll back one of the most divisive political, cultural and business issues of our time.\n\nIn many ways the nation\u2019s largest lender is an outlier in continuing to support DEI, or the use of racial and \u201cintersectional\u201d (gender and genderidentity) preferences in hiring.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon speaks during a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing in Washington DC on Dec. 6, 2023. Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nCompanies are dropping the practice because of its dubious legality following the 2023 SCOTUS ruling outlawing affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nPresident Trump has signed executive orders ending DEI in federal contracting, and is calling on major companies to do the same.\n\nAnd many are.\n\nJust this past Friday, BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money manager and once a major DEI adherent, said that while it loves diversity, it is \u201cnot requiring managers to interview a diverse slate of candidates for open positions.\u201d\n\nOthers have gone so far as to drop the word \u201cequity\u201d or guaranteed outcomes from their hiring metrics.\n\nYet it\u2019s unclear where exactly JPMorgan, led by mega-banker Jamie Dimon, stands on the issue.\n\nDimon has a long history supporting DEI, and became obsessed with it in 2020 during the social-justice George Floyd riots.\n\nBut a lot has changed since our \u201csummer of love,\u201d as the left termed those turbulent times, and Dimon has spent most of the past month of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency attempting to spin his way out of a possible confrontation with the anti-DEI president.\n\nChanging public filings\n\nJPM has begun altering public filings as they relate to so-called intersectional hiring preferences at the bank.\n\nSome people at the bank tell me there will be at least a semantic weakening of the bank\u2019s DEI commitment.\n\nOn deck, my sources there say, is a revamping of the DEI section of its website, which features maybe the most florid examples of DEI worship in the business community.\n\nAs it stands now, the website boasts that \u201c58% of new US hires are racially or ethnically diverse,\u201d and 49% of all global new hires are women.\n\nThe company has had a 35% increase in \u201cself-identifying\u201d LBGTQ+ employees in the last year it posted data, following a 50% increase.\n\nThere are \u201c500+\u201d LBGTQ+ managing directors and executive directors at the bank, it adds.\n\nPeople at JPM say look for possible new language that softens such DEI humblebrags.\n\nIt may even remove \u201cequity\u201d from its diversity hiring metrics, like many others already have.\n\nYet, these semantic changes won\u2019t satisfy the Trump White House, and the president himself, my reporting suggests.\n\nWhite House advisers tell me language tweaks often obscure the backdoor use of illegal hiring preferences.\n\nThe president, they tell me, wants a color-blind country, and he wants corporate America\u2019s buy-in. Too much is at stake to downgrade skill when we are in a global war for economic supremacyand freedom with China.\n\nNo confusion from Don\n\nFor proof, they say, look no further than Trump\u2019s Truth Social feed where he recently singled out Apple for JPM-like DEI worship.\n\nAs Trump wrote in all caps so there was no confusion about where he stood: \u201cAPPLE SHOULD GET RID OF DEI RULES, NOT JUST MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEM,\u201d adding that \u201cDEI WAS A HOAX THAT HAS BEEN VERY BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. DEI IS GONE!!!\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Dimon attempted more damage control, this time with the people over at CNBC. When asked about his DEI commitment, Dimon said: \u201cI don\u2019t like wasted money on bureaucracy . . . obviously you have to modify your plans, but we look at our policies all the time\u2026 But if we did something wrong with DEI, we\u2019re going to fix it.\n\nI never had a problem admitting that we did too much and we need to change something.\u201d\n\nWhat that gibberish means in reality is difficult to say. A JPM spokesman later told me the bank is \u201cstill committed\u201d to DEI.\n\n\u201cChanging something doesn\u2019t mean weakening\u201d it, the flack insisted.\n\nThe spokesman also said all hiring is merit-based, which again seems like a contradiction if you\u2019re committed to DEI.\n\nDimon\u2019s handlers have argued in the past that JPM is a highly profitable enterprise while employing DEI, so it must account for something.\n\nTrue, JPM is profitable, but DEI is hardly the reason any big bank makes money.\n\nDimon is a very good banker, but for all his skills as a manager, he runs a business protected by the federal government since the 2008 financial crisis, aka it\u2019s Too Big To Fail.\n\nThat designation allows it to borrow cheaply and lend more expensively.\n\nIt almost seems like it\u2019s able to print money even when the economy sputters.\n\nSorry, the real reason Dimon can\u2019t pull himself away from DEI is because he\u2019s a progressive, and always has been. He\u2019s slated to retire in the next few years, and might run for office as a Democrat or take a job in academia.\n\nBoth are places that remain committed to racialized employment policies, which explains a lot.",

            "content": "Amazon Web Services provides data and computing technology to other companies.\n\nIt has become a key part of Wall Street technology, with many firms relying on it.\n\nHere's how it's helping finance firms and fintechs with generative AI efforts.\n\nGenerative AI has upped the ante in the public cloud war for Wall Street's wallet share.\n\nAmazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, the cloud-computing arms of the respective Big Tech companies, have been duking it out to be the financial industry's go-to cloud provider. Strategies to win that business extended beyond just providing technology \u2014 many are now focusing on helping clients roll out AI.\n\nTo keep its edge, Amazon said it plans to deploy around $105 billion in its business, much of which will go toward AWS and its AI efforts. For a look at how that money may touch Wall Street, Business Insider spoke with John Kain, the head of financial services market development at AWS. Kain, who worked at JPMorgan Chase and Nasdaq before switching industries, outlined the future direction of AWS' Wall Street business through four different clients: two large international banks, a hedge fund, and a fintech.\n\n\"The tasks are getting more complex, things are becoming much more agentic in nature, much more tailored for individual use cases to get real price performance benefits,\" Kain said, referring to the industry's AI maturity.\n\nMuch of the work behind the scenes has been around cutting down on the number of hallucinations, a common issue where inaccurate responses are presented as fact.\n\nOne example is with AWS Bedrock, a service that helps customers build generative AI applications and models. Last year, AWS introduced a feature called Bedrock Guardrails that looks at the responses coming out of large language models, and then uses another large language model to check whether that answer actually was a good response. In some cases, this approach detected about 75% of hallucinations, Kain said.\n\nOther AWS efforts, like automated reasoning, have tried to use mathematical proofs to prove that the information from generative AI models is factually correct.\n\nHere's how AWS is helping Wall Street firms use generative AI.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\n\nAWS focus area: Security and scale\n\nWhen Lori Beer, JPMorgan's global chief information officer, took the stage at AWS re:Invent in December, she charted the bank's embrace of the cloud, which started in 2017. In 2020, JPM had 100 apps in the cloud, and it doubled that number the following year. It also built its UK consumer bank from the ground up on AWS.\n\nJPMorgan now has over a thousand applications running on AWS that fully take advantage of generative AI technologies, Kain said.\n\nLori Beer, CIO at JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan\n\nJPMorgan's internal data and AI platform relies on AWS SageMaker, a tool for creating and training machine-learning models, with more than 5,000 employees using the cloud-based tool every month, Beer said. The bank has simplified the process of developing new models, from experimentation to deploying them live, she added.\n\n\"This platform is empowering us to build the next wave of AI applications at the firm,\" she said.\n\nSecurity, governance, and compliance measures in the cloud were key to JPMorgan's uptake, according to Kain.\n\nJPMorgan, which processes $10 trillion in payments daily and counts 82 million customers in the US, is considered the world's most systemically important bank, according to the Financial Stability Board, which identifies global systemically important financial institutions.\n\n\"Organizations like JPMorgan, they have a unique scale and complexity that comes with being a globally regulated organization in multiple lines of business and we get to learn alongside of them,\" Kain said, adding that the bank's business compliance and security perspective helped drive AWS' roadmap forward.\n\nBridgewater\n\nAWS focus area: coordinating specialized models for investment research\n\nAbout two years ago, Bridgewater pulled together a group of investors, data scientists, and technologists to rethink how the hedge fund understood markets and economies with AI and machine learning first. Thus, AIA Labs was born. Short for artificial investment associate, the division within the investment firm sought to recreate \"everything that we do via machine-learning techniques,\" Bridgewater's co-chief investment officer Greg Jensen previously told BI.\n\nBridgewater Associates co-CIO Greg Jensen. Bridgewater Associates\n\n\"It started on a notepad, graduated to Excel, and is now running on EKS and various other AWS services,\" AIA Labs CTO Aaron Linsky said at re:Invent in December.\n\nRelated stories\n\nEarly on, the capabilities on the generative AI side were mostly limited to asking a straightforward question, getting the AI to figure out how to write code to exract that data from Bridgewater's system, and produce a response, Kain said.\n\n\"That was great, it was saving hours and hours of time,\" he said, and made it so investment analysts didn't have to bug developers to get the data.\n\nNow, Bridgewater's AI platform can take a complex investing strategy and analyze it.\n\n\"They showed how they were able to take that complex investment question, break it into multiple steps, and have each of those steps go out to a particular agent,\" Kain said. For example, one agent may check how interest rates affect overall returns, another could double-check the financials, and a third may summarize the risk profile.\n\n\"We found today that limiting the breadth of responsibilities for any given agent is really important,\" Linsky said.\n\n\"We're on the path towards full agentic workflows,\" Linsky said, adding, \"we're definitely not replacing our investment associates with the capabilities right now, but it is helping to speed along their process.\"\n\nMUFG\n\nAWS focus area: turning multiple data sets into new sales ideas\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, which offers everything from investment banking to treasury management and trade finance, is using generative AI to give its corporate salespeople a leg up. An AI platform that suggests sales ideas has led to a 30% conversion rate, Tetsuo Horigane, head of quant innovation at MUFG, said at re:Invent.\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) is a large Japanese bank. Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMUFG began developing generative AI applications in 2023 after launching an in-house AI/ML team two years prior, Horigane said. MUFG also has about 2,000 employees serving roughly 1 million corporate clients,\n\nThe bank's salespeople typically read through hundreds or thousands of pages of documents to understand a given client's situation and what financial product is most relevant to them. But now the AI platform combines multiple data sets, like the client's transaction history, previous sales conversions to understand what they're in the market for, their financial filings, and public information like news, Kain said.\n\nThis process of drafting a sales pitch, which could take several hours or days, could now be done in a matter of minutes, Horigane said.\n\nAWS focus area: using call center AI to influence strategy and experience\n\nAI in call centers is nothing novel, but for Rocket Mortgage, it's leading executives to think about whole new strategies and experiences.\n\nThe fintech integrated AWS's generative AI technology into its call centers to lessen the load for its thousands of call center employees who field calls, emails, and webchats every day.\n\nBut the idea is not just to have one AI assistant, but \"an entire network of agents,\" Dan Vasquez, VP of AI strategy at Rocket Mortgage, said at re:Invent. They help with transcribing, picking out key pieces of information mid-call, and providing insights and data about the call after the fact, he said.\n\nGenerative AI has helped save some 40,000 hours annually for call center employees and enabled 70% of client support to be fully self-served, Vasquez said.\n\nBut now, Rocket Mortgage is using those 10 petabytes of data to figure out \"what should we do next?\"\n\nThat's the real benefit, Kain said, for the fintech to start asking big questions like \"why are my customers calling me\" and \"what are my most common problems,\" and use that intel to rethink its online platforms, streamline workflows, and improve the overall customer experience.",

Some of the contracts had already been paid out or were legally protected, meaning the cancellations didn't make a difference.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nEven worse, DOGE's own financial reports were found to be exaggerated\u2014one contract initially touted as an $8 billion reduction turned out to be just $8 million. If these numbers are off, what else might be?\n\nMeanwhile, inside government agencies, not everyone is on board. The Wall Street Journal reported that at least 21 federal employees\u2014including data scientists and engineers\u2014have quit in protest. They argue that DOGE's aggressive cuts are putting critical services at risk, slashing budgets without a clear plan for how essential operations will continue.\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nIt's not just individual employees pushing back\u2014entire agencies are feeling the heat. Take the Social Security Administration, for example.\n\nWhen its acting commissioner, Michelle King, resigned after resisting DOGE's financial scrutiny, the agency shut down two offices. According to The Baltimore Banner, this left about 200 employees in limbo and raised concerns about potential service disruptions for millions of Americans who rely on SSA programs.\n\nThen there's the legal mess. DOGE is facing lawsuits, with government watchdogs and unions arguing that its actions are overstepping legal boundaries.\n\nSee Also: The $1.3 Billion Startup Investment Boom: How This Company's Explosive Growth Is Opening Doors For Everyday Investors With A New $500 Minimum\n\nReuters reported that one of the biggest issues is DOGE's demand that federal employees disclose personal financial details\u2014a move critics say violates privacy laws. Questions are also swirling about whether the initiative even has the legal authority to make some of its sweeping changes.\n\nBack in the \u201890s, the Clinton administration launched the \"Reinventing Government\" initiative, led by Al Gore.\n\nIt successfully cut costs while keeping bipartisan support and maintaining stability. According to the Associated Press, the difference between then and now is that Gore's effort relied on careful planning and collaboration\u2014something critics say DOGE is missing.\n\nRead Next:",

Each day I focus on 3 stories that are making a difference in the financial technology space. Coupled with things worth watching & most important money movements, it\u2019s the only newsletter you need for all things when Finance meets Tech.\n\nIf you\u2019re not a subscriber, here\u2019s what you missed this week:\n\nAs for today, here are the 3 fascinating FinTech stories that were changing the world of financial technology as we know it. This was yet another insane week in the financial technology space so make sure to check all the above stories.\n\nInside JPMorgan's AI Revolution \ud83e\udd16\ud83c\udfe6\n\nFollowing the trends \ud83e\udd16 JPMorgan Chase JPM 0.00%\u2191 America's largest bank, is making a strategic bet on artificial intelligence by placing it at the center of operations for its 300,000 employees.\n\nAccording to a recent Wall Street Journal interview with Teresa Heitsenrether, JPMorgan's chief data and analytics officer who oversees the bank's AI strategy, the technology is already showing promising results across various functions.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the most interesting insights shared.\n\nMore on this \ud83d\udc49 Since its rollout, JPMorgan's AI tool called LLM Suite has been deployed to 200,000 employees, with half using it actively every day. Not too shabby!\n\nOn average, employees engage with the tool for one to two hours weekly. The system leverages generative artificial intelligence from OpenAI and other providers, helping employees across multiple business functions.\n\nHeitsenrether, who despite not being a technologist brings over 20 years of experience running key businesses at JPMorgan, identified numerous applications where AI is improving productivity. These include:\n\nStreamlining the preparation of client briefing materials\n\nAnalyzing legal documents\n\nEnhancing call center operations, and\n\nSupporting investment banking analysis.\n\nRather than developing proprietary large language models, JPMorgan is focusing on integrating existing models with the bank's internal knowledge and data.\n\nThe bank is following a three-phase approach: first, deploying tools for general use; second, connecting models to JPMorgan-specific information like policies and client data; and third, enabling more sophisticated reasoning capabilities.\n\nZoom out \ud83d\udd0e Regarding workforce implications, Heitsenrether offered a nuanced perspective. Unlike previous technological waves that primarily automated clerical tasks, AI has applications across all job functions. She emphasized that AI will augment rather than replace employees, enabling humans and AI to accomplish more together.\n\nThe bank maintains rigorous controls around AI implementation, applying different models based on risk profiles. For high-stakes decisions like credit approvals, JPMorgan employs constrained, transparent models, while using more flexible systems for lower-risk scenarios like travel planning.\n\n\u2708\ufe0f THE TAKEAWAY\n\nWhat\u2019s next? \ud83e\udd14 Looking ahead, JPMorgan's approach signals a transformative shift in how financial institutions will operate. As banks integrate AI more deeply with proprietary data, we'll likely see the emergence of financial institutions that function increasingly as technology companies with banking licenses. This evolution will create competitive differentiation based on how effectively institutions leverage their unique data assets. As Heitsenrether brilliantly put it:\n\n\"The models are all trained on all the data that's publicly available... What the models don't have access to is the data that's specific to the enterprise. That then becomes the differentiator.\"\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, this suggests customer experiences will become increasingly personalized and responsive. Digital channels empowered by AI will handle more complex inquiries that previously required human intervention, potentially reshaping branch networks and call centers. Additionally, the careful, phased rollout at JPMorgan also indicates that successful AI implementation in banking will require a deliberate balance between innovation and risk management. Financial institutions that can navigate regulatory concerns while scaling AI capabilities will likely emerge as industry leaders. Zooming out, as AI becomes more deeply embedded in financial services, we may see a new paradigm where human expertise is channeled toward higher-value activities like relationship building and complex problem-solving, with AI handling more routine aspects of financial operations across both consumer and institutional banking. AI-first banks are the future.\n\nICYMI: Wall Street giant JPMorgan continues to show strong momentum despite macro headwinds \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udfe6 [breaking down their Q4 2024 financials, what they mean & whether JPM is worth your time and money in 2025 + bonus reads on JPM inside]\n\nBank of America is poised to enter the stablecoin market \ud83d\udc40\ud83e\ude99\n\nThe news \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Banking giant Bank of America BAC 0.00%\u2191 is preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market through stablecoins once regulatory frameworks are established, according to CEO Brian Moynihan.\n\nSpeaking at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., Moynihan expressed confidence that stablecoins are imminent in the financial services industry, describing them as digital assets backed by the U.S. dollar that function similarly to money market funds with check access.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at this and see why it matters.\n\nMore on this \ud83d\udc49 \"If they make that legal, we will go into that business,\" Moynihan stated during his interview with David Rubenstein, indicating that Bank of America would offer \"BofA coins\" linked to U.S. dollar deposit accounts once legislation permits. He noted that under the Trump administration, lawmakers are actively working to pass stablecoin regulations.\n\nWhile expressing certainty about stablecoins' arrival, Moynihan raised questions about their practical applications, commenting that \"the question of what it's useful for is going to be interesting.\"\n\nZoom out \ud83d\udd0e The stablecoin initiative reflects Bank of America's broader technology strategy, with the institution investing approximately $4 billion in new technology annually and allocating an additional $8-9 billion to maintain existing systems.\n\nThis technological focus has already yielded significant results, with 90% of customer interactions now occurring digitally and 40 million consumers using the bank's digital services.\n\nDespite this digital transformation, Moynihan emphasized that human interaction remains crucial. Bank of America maintains approximately 3,700 branches across the United States, recognizing that customers value multiple communication channels.\n\n\u2708\ufe0f THE TAKEAWAY\n\nWhat\u2019s next? \ud83e\udd14 At the core, Bank of America's potential entry into the stablecoin market represents a pivotal moment in the mainstream financial adoption of cryptocurrency technologies. As one of the largest U.S. banks (ranking 18th in the Fortune 500), BoA's move signals growing institutional confidence in blockchain-based financial products. This should lead to:\n\nMainstream legitimization : BofA's involvement would likely encourage other major financial institutions to develop similar offerings, potentially transforming stablecoins from relatively still niche products to standard financial tools.\n\nRegulatory framework development : The bank's conditional stance (\"if they make that legal\") highlights the critical role that upcoming regulations will play in shaping the stablecoin landscape. The Trump administration's crypto-friendly approach may accelerate this process.\n\nIntegration with traditional banking : Rather than competing with traditional banking, BoA's approach suggests stablecoins will be integrated into existing financial infrastructure (as they should be!), potentially offering customers the benefits of both worlds.\n\nEvolution of payment systems: BoA's stablecoin initiative could significantly impact payment processing, potentially reducing costs and increasing transaction speeds while maintaining the stability of dollar-backed assets.\n\nSlowly then all at once. Bullish.\n\nICYMI:\n\nPayPal is strategically expanding its PYUSD stablecoin \ud83e\ude99\ud83d\udcc8 [what\u2019s the play here, why it matters & what\u2019s next + bonus deep dive into PayPal]\n\nAmerican Express expands Chinese footprint \ud83d\udcb3\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3\n\nThe news \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f American Express AXP 0.00%\u2191 has formed a significant alliance with Alipay, China's digital payments giant, to accelerate its expansion in what analysts consider the world's fastest-growing card market.\n\nThe partnership enables American Express cardholders in mainland China to add their credit cards to Alipay digital wallets, substantially expanding their payment options across the country.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at this.\n\nMore on this \ud83d\udc49 This strategic move positions American Express to capitalize on China's booming digital payments landscape at a time when global card usage is projected to surge 43% worldwide by 2029. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to experience the most dramatic growth at 46.8%, far outpacing the United States' projected 27% increase, according to research firm Nilson Report.\n\nMore importantly, the partnership represents a significant milestone in American Express's China journey. In 2020, the New York-based company became the first non-Chinese firm to receive a license to clear local currency card transactions through its own network. Before this regulatory breakthrough, American Express was required to process payments through partnerships with Chinese state-controlled entities like UnionPay.\n\nZoom out \ud83d\udd0e Other major card networks have faced varying degrees of success in China's closely regulated financial market. Mastercard MA 0.00%\u2191 received initial approval to operate in 2020 and began processing transactions in 2023 following high-level discussions between U.S. and Chinese leadership. Visa V 0.00%\u2191, despite applying for a license in 2020, continues working with Chinese authorities to secure approval.\n\nAlipay, established in 2004 as a subsidiary of Alibaba Group, claims acceptance by 80 million Chinese merchants and has expanded its digital wallet services to other Asian markets including Thailand and South Korea.\n\nHowever, we must note that the partnership comes with limitations \u2013 notably, the service is unavailable to holders of American Express cards issued outside mainland China.\n\n\u2708\ufe0f THE TAKEAWAY\n\nWhat\u2019s next? \ud83e\udd14 This alliance signals a significant shift in China's approach to international financial service providers while highlighting American Express's commitment to the Chinese market. The partnership could also serve as a blueprint for other Western financial institutions seeking to navigate China's complex regulatory environment. For AmEx, success in China represents enormous growth potential given the country's massive population and rapidly expanding middle class. However, challenges remain, including intense competition from entrenched local payment platforms and potential regulatory uncertainties. Looking ahead, American Express will likely focus on deepening its integration with China's digital ecosystem while expanding its cardholder base within mainland China. Competitors will watch closely, potentially accelerating their own partnership strategies with local technology companies.\n\nICYMI: American Express\u2019 Q4 2024: premium FinTech powerhouse poised for profitable growth \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcb3 [breaking down their Q4 2024 financials, what they tell us & what\u2019s next for AmEx + a bonus dive into their competition]\n\n\ud83d\udd0e What else I\u2019m watching\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Following the Money\n\nCredCore , a vertical-AI company that transforms debt capital markets for lenders and borrowers, today announced $16M in Series A.

            "content": "JPMorgan Chase (JPM 3.08%) is a financial services powerhouse. Its product offering ranges from basic checking and savings accounts for consumers all the way to mergers and acquisitions advice for some of the largest corporations around. This gives it a pivotal role in our economy.\n\nShares have produced a total return well in excess of the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.63%) in the past five years. Investors want to know if a repeat performance is in the cards. Is this top bank stock a buy right now?\n\nJPMorgan Chase's staying power\n\nInvesting is best when it's focused on the long term. Owning businesses for many years lets compounding work its magic. Of course, the key to doing this successfully is to first find companies that have staying power.\n\nJPMorgan Chase fits the bill here. Facilitating the flow of capital to support the smooth functioning of economies and capital markets is perhaps the most important activity any company could be doing. Imagine what would happen if JPMorgan Chase's operations just suddenly stopped tomorrow. This highlights how critical the business is to its customer base.\n\nWith its 2025 revenue of $178 billion and asset base of $4 trillion, this financial services entity is absolutely massive. That scale provides an advantage. JPMorgan Chase is better able to leverage its operating expenses compared to smaller rivals. Its size also allows it to make significant investments in marketing and technology to further advance its industry position.\n\nJPMorgan Chase's net profit margin in the past five years averaged a superb 33%. This is higher than all of its money-center peers, a group that includes Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup.\n\nLike other banks, JPMorgan benefits from switching costs as well. Once a consumer signs up for a checking account and a credit card, for example, they are likely to handle more of their financial activity with the same company. And this essentially leads to a lock-in effect.\n\nThe same is probably true on the corporate side. Let's say a hot tech start-up decides to go public and hires JPMorgan Chase to help with the transaction. If things go well, the bank has a client for life that can come to it for any sort of strategic advisory. At the end of the day, this results in lucrative fees that pad the company's bottom line.\n\nDon't forget the valuation\n\nInvestors won't struggle to figure out that JPMorgan is a high-quality business. It is a leader in the banking industry, has a highly regarded CEO in Jamie Dimon, and possesses sustainable competitive advantages. I think the stock should at least be on every investor's radar.\n\nBut is this a business to buy for your portfolio right now? I don't believe so. A look at the valuation will cause investors to think the same way.\n\nShares traded at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of under 1.2 in late 2022. Buying the stock then would've resulted in a fantastic return. The market was probably worried about the impact rapidly rising interest rates would have.\n\nSince then, investor sentiment has drastically improved, thanks to strong financial results. JPMorgan's net interest income is up 77% in the past three years.\n\nAs of this writing, the stock trades at a P/B ratio of 2.3. The average of its money-center rivals is just 1.2. To be fair, JPMorgan typically sells at a premium, as it is the most dominant bank in this group.\n\nHowever, it's hard to argue that the current valuation isn't stretched. In the past five years, the P/B multiple has averaged 1.6. And besides hitting a peak in February, the stock hasn't been more expensive in the last 20 years.\n\nKeep JPMorgan Chase on your watch list for now. Given the ebbs and flows of the economic cycle, there will likely be a time to scoop up shares in the future at a much more compelling valuation.",

Speaking at a recent JPMorgan conference in Miami Beach, Dimon admitted he should not have cursed during the heated exchange but stood by his firm stance against work-from-home arrangements where they do not serve the company's best interests. \"I should never curse, ever,\" Dimon said in a CNBC interview, acknowledging that his anger was misplaced but his position on the issue remained firm.The controversy erupted during a town hall meeting in Columbus, Ohio, on February 12, where a JPMorgan tech support analyst, Nicolas Welch, questioned the necessity of a five-day in-office mandate. Welch pointed out that his team, which is spread across multiple countries, functioned effectively during the pandemic and even under the prior hybrid work model. Dimon responded with an eight-minute tirade, arguing that remote work had led to inefficiencies, lack of collaboration, and reduced productivity among employees.The CEO\u2019s remarks fueled internal discontent, particularly after audio recordings surfaced of him dismissing a petition signed by 950 employees opposing the return-to-office mandate. \"Don\u2019t waste time on it. I don\u2019t care how many people sign that f***ing petition,\" Dimon reportedly said, reinforcing his belief that the company\u2019s leadership\u2014not individual employees\u2014should determine workplace policies.Following the town hall, Welch claimed he was briefly fired by his supervisor, Vice President Garrett Monaghan, who allegedly told him to \"clean off your desk and get the f**k out of here.\" Welch later clarified that senior management intervened to reverse the decision, with JPMorgan officials stating that no formal termination had occurred. Global IT support head Megan Mead assured Welch that the matter had been \"smoothed over.\"JPMorgan employees currently on hybrid schedules are required to return to the office full-time starting in March, with a 30-day notice given. Dimon defended this decision by emphasizing the negative impacts of remote work on younger employees and overall company efficiency. He argued that in-office work fosters better collaboration, networking, and professional development. He also criticized employees for being distracted during virtual meetings, stating, \"You don\u2019t do that in my goddamn meetings.\"Despite the internal debates, JPMorgan Chase has seen record-breaking financial performance. The company\u2019s profits surged in 2024, and its share price has nearly doubled over the past five years. Some employees questioned the necessity of strict office mandates given the firm's strong financial results, but Dimon maintained that a disciplined workplace culture was essential for long-term success.As JPMorgan moves forward with its return-to-office plan, Dimon remains unwavering in his belief that in-office work is crucial for the company\u2019s growth. Employees now face the choice of complying with the policy or seeking opportunities elsewhere.Jamie Dimon believes remote work causes inefficiencies and weakens collaboration, especially for younger employees.No, Nicolas Welch was initially told to leave but later reinstated by senior management.",

I should never curse, ever,' he said during a CNBC interview at a recent JPMorgan conference in Miami Beach.\n\n'I shouldn't get angry or stuff like that. And the gentleman asked a long question and I answered the question. I tried to give a lot of detail which I think he\u2019s entitled to because I\u2019ve never, ever fired anyone because they asked a question like that,' Dimon added.\n\n'I completely respect people who don't want to go to the office all five days of the week. That's your right, it's my right, it's a citizen's right,' he continued.\n\n'But they should respect that the company is going to decide what's good for the clients, the company, et cetera \u2013 not the individual. I'm not being mean, they can get a job elsewhere. I understand that. It may make total sense for them to do that.'\n\n'I\u2019m not against work from home.

He apologized for cursing in the presence of his employees and said he's only against remote work 'where it doesn't work'\n\nJPMorgan employees on hybrid schedules are set to return to the office full time in March. Employees were also given 30 days of notice (Pictured: JPMorgan building in London, United Kingdom)\n\nDimon's more polite take on remote work comes after audio leaked of him shouting down an employee who asked a question about the return-to-office mandate at the February 12 town hall.\n\nAmong other things, Dimon was furious that 950 staffers had signed a petition against the new five-day in-office policy.\n\n'Don't waste time on it. I don't care how many people sign that f***ing petition,' he said.\n\nNicolas Welch, a tech support analyst at the bank since 2017, was the one who asked the question that prompted this angry response from Dimon.\n\nThe self-confessed 'old hillbilly' said dragging everyone back to the office went against the firm's 'good conscience'.\n\nDimon responded with the now-notorious eight-minute expletive-laden rant against working from home, and Welch claimed he was briefly fired as a result.\n\nJPMorgan workers nervously laughed as their colleague explained he wanted to dive into the subject that was on everyone's mind.\n\n'No problem, no problem! Go ahead, yeah,' Dimon responded.\n\nJPMorgan techie Nicolas Welch, whose question at a company town hall triggered an extraordinary work-from-home rant by the chief executive, claims he was briefly fired over it\n\nDimon responded with a long rant against working from home, and defended his earlier order dragging all employees back into the office five days a week\n\nWelch began by touting the success the bank had navigating the Covid pandemic from home and how effectively his team functioned during that time.\n\nThen about two years ago, Welch explained, a hybrid work mandate came in and he and his team were brought back into the office three days a week.\n\nThe employee said that the return order seemed pointless as his team had members scattered from India to Argentina and never interacted in person.\n\n'I had difficulty at the time because I couldn't in good conscience support my team, which did not really need an office to operate,' he said.\n\n'My team had no reason to do so, but I knew that if I couldn't support it, I couldn't in good conscience manage this team to do so.'\n\nWelch said the biggest issue was that the demand to come back to the office part time wasn't justified in a way that made sense, and went against the longstanding culture of JPMorgan.\n\n'My managers also couldn't manage that, they could not speak to it either. The answers that we got at the time were effectively \"because I said so,\"' he said.\n\n'In ten years of working here, that's not an environment that's ever even been close to it. Our work here has always been work by your conscience rather than by a directive.\n\nWelch was sitting front row at the meeting in Columbus, Ohio, on Wednesday and asked the third question of Dimon, prompting his now-infamous response\n\n'And I have to say that is because of your leadership as well, the times that you've just over the years stood up to tyrants in the way that you operate.'\n\nWelch outlined his own circumstances, with his team of seven spread across several time zones.\n\n'There's just no way that being in an office makes any difference for us specifically,' he said.\n\n'So, all I'm asking is that - I'm not suggesting you rescind such an order - but suggesting it be left up to managers of individual teams themselves on the necessity of an office workplace.'\n\nThe room burst into applause as Welch finished his speech, before Dimon cut in to ask curtly: 'That it?'\n\n'I'm going to give you a complete answer,' the CEO responded. 'There is no chance that I would leave that up to managers. Zero chance.\n\n'The abuse that took place is extraordinary. You may be a great manager, but\u2026 I\u2019m going to give you examples of how bad it got. OK?'\n\nWelch laughed about the saga on Reddit the day after, saying: 'I was in the front row, I was the one who asked the question. It was AMAZING.\n\n'I am satisfied that he was goaded in to dropping F-Bombs on a recorded meeting.'\n\nBut Welch also revealed that he was briefly fired by a furious vice president who accused him of embarrassing the company.\n\nJPMorgan's offices in Columbus, Ohio, where Welch works\n\n'When I got back to my desk, I was screamed at (with witnesses) to \"get the F**K out of this office!\"' he wrote.\n\nWelch elaborated to Fortune magazine that after the town hall, he was summoned to a meeting with his former boss, Garrett Monaghan, now a vice president but still in the same division.\n\n'I don't know what the f**k you just did, but come to my desk immediately when that town hall ends. Please,' the text read.\n\nWelch said when he arrived at the office, he was pulled into a meeting with Jeffrey Merrill, another of his former bosses from 2018 to 2021 who was now a VP.\n\nHe claimed Monaghan told him he 'just dragged our whole organization through the mud. Go and clean off your desk and get the f**k out of here'.\n\nWelch texted his direct boss, IT support Customer success manager Richard Cundiff, from the parking lot - who, like Dimon said in the town hall, had moved to Florida.\n\nHe told him Monaghan had 'threatened my job, so I've been ordered home', to which Cundiff replied, 'Thanks for letting me know.'\n\nWelch asked to speak with Welch's boss, but she was on vacation and Cundiff told him 'I will inform her in our next meeting'.\n\nCEO of Chase Jamie Dimon (L) and wife Judith Kent arrive for a State Dinner in honor of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, at the Booksellers Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 10, 2024\n\nHe went home and assumed he no longer had a job.\n\nBut hours later he got a call from Megan Mead, who heads up all of global IT support as part of the Technology Employee Support Services division, and outranked Monaghan, Merrill, and Cundiff.\n\nMead told him he wasn't fired and she had 'smoothed things over' with Monaghan during a 45-minute conversation.\n\n'I appreciate you, Nic and I am really proud about how you responded to a pretty unfair circumstance,' Mead wrote in a follow-up text message.\n\nMonaghan, chastened by his boss, sent a text to Welch to apologize for overreacting and admit he owed him a beer.\n\n'I agree with your message, if not the delivery. We good?' he wrote.\n\nJPMorgan insisted Welch was never actually fired, regardless of Monaghan's outburst.\n\n'He didn't say anything wrong in the town hall,' the firm told Fortune.\n\nActually firing Welch would have required filing paperwork and executing other procedures that appeared never to have happened.\n\nBrief clips of Dimon's long, expletive-laden answer to Welch's question were leaked within hours and widely reported by news outlets.\n\nThe longtime boss clarified that he was not against working from home as a concept, and 10 per cent of JPMorgan staff worked remotely in a way that worked.\n\nHowever, he said he came to the realization that hybrid working wasn't working for the rest of the company, and was causing huge inefficiencies.\n\n'Now, your manager moved to Florida. We never made a promise that it would be forever. That\u2019s their problem, not mine,' he said.\n\n'So people said, \"We moved, we didn\u2019t move\" - we always told people that we were going to be a work-from-the-office type of company.\n\n'And so we allowed three days and two days. But here are the problems, OK? And they are substantial\u2026the young generation is being damaged by this.\n\n'They may or may not be in your particular staff, but they are being left behind. They\u2019re being left behind socially, ideas, meeting people.\n\n'In fact, my guess is most of you live in communities a hell of a lot less diverse than this room.'\n\nDimon also railed against the 'rudeness' of staff fiddling with their phones and not paying attention during Zoom calls, which he said 'slows down efficiency, creativity'.\n\n'When I found out that people were doing that - you don\u2019t do that in my goddamn meetings. If you\u2019re going to meet with me, you\u2019ve got my attention, you\u2019ve got my focus, I don\u2019t bring my goddamn phone, I\u2019m not sending texts to people,' he said.\n\n'It simply doesn\u2019t work. It doesn\u2019t work for creativity, it slows down decision-making.\n\n'And don\u2019t give me this s**t that work-from-home-Friday works. I call a lot of people on Fridays, and there\u2019s not a goddamn person you can get a hold of.'\n\nDimon speaks to the media after the townhall on February 12, before clips of his rant leaked\n\nDimon acknowledged the need for flexibility, particularly for mothers and caregivers, but said managers failed to manage to properly and it got out of hand.\n\n'They didn\u2019t manage, they were making exceptions, and people making exceptions for exceptions, and meanwhile, head count has gone up by 50,000 people in four, five years,' he said.\n\n'We don\u2019t need all those people. We were putting people in jobs because the people weren\u2019t doing the job they were hired to do in the first place. It simply doesn\u2019t work.\n\n'I will not be responsible for a company like that, OK, and I\u2019m sorry. Now - you have a choice. You don\u2019t have to work at JPMorgan. So the people of you who don\u2019t want to work at the company, that\u2019s fine with me.'\n\nDimon then went off on a tangent about the firm having too much bureaucracy that needed to be reined in, and asked for suggestions from staff.\n\n'We\u2019re going to build a great company, and we\u2019re going to be disciplined and detailed and factual and honest and hardworking, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to do it. And honest with each other,' he said.\n\n'So, anyway, the bureaucracy stuff - if you have brilliant ideas, send them to me.'\n\nAt another point in the town hall, Dimon was questioned about a petition against his WFH policy change that garnered more than 1,550 signatures.\n\nIn a separate recording reviewed by Reuters, Dimon said: 'Don\u2019t waste time on it. I don\u2019t care how many people sign that f**king petition.'\n\nJPMorgan's profits surged to a record in 2024, and its share price roughly doubled in the past five years.\n\nThe strong performance prompted some workers to question why they needed to spend more time in the office.",

            "content": "One of the world\u2019s biggest banks, JP Morgan, has promoted \u00adenvironmental and \u201csustainable\u201d funds to customers which have invested more than \u00a3200m in the mining giant Glencore, it can be revealed.\n\nEthical investing has become big business for JP Morgan and other financial giants, with worldwide \u201csustainable\u201d investing expected to surpass $40tn by 2030. But the industry now faces scrutiny over the rules around investments focusing on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.\n\nSeveral of JP Morgan\u2019s \u201csustainable\u201d funds are investing in the London-listed commodity trader Glencore, which is under fire for its coal operations in South Africa, an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the news website Voxeurop and the Daily Maverick, an online South African news publication, has revealed.\n\nJP Morgan\u2019s asset management arm has more than 500 funds promoted as environmental or sustainable investments, ranging from a climate change solutions fund to a global healthcare fund. Under current rules, some of these may still hold investments in firms criticised for environmentally damaging practices.\n\nFor many of its funds that are promoted as sustainable, JP Morgan specifies that at least 51% of investments must have positive environmental and/or social characteristics. The remaining 49% can be invested without such restrictions.\n\nJakob Thom\u00e4, chief executive of \u00adclimate thinktank Theia Finance Labs, said: \u201cThe overwhelming majority of retail investors, in my view, would feel misled if they knew that was the \u00adcriteria for labelling something as a sustainable fund.\u201d\n\nHe said some sustainable funds may be breaking EU law, which says anything that \u201cdeceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer\u201d is misleading commercial practice.\n\nView image in fullscreen A view of a coal-fired power station from the town of Phola, which is situated in Mpumalanga\u2019s coal belt in South Africa. Photograph: Julia Evans/Daily Maverick\n\nJP Morgan\u2019s sustainable funds also exclude companies that make more than 20% of revenues from thermal coal extraction. Despite being one of the world\u2019s biggest coal companies, Glencore slips under this threshold in terms of revenues. In terms of actual profit, however, coal mining accounts for nearly half.\n\nThe investments have angered campaigners who have highlighted environmental breaches in Glencore\u2019s operation in South Africa\u2019s coal belt. Glencore runs three mining complexes around the mining town of Phola, Mpumalanga, which is about 70 miles east of Johannesburg. According to a recent South African government report, obtained via a freedom of information request, one of those has been breaking environmental laws since 2017.\n\nThe company\u2019s Tweefontein coalmine has been accused by the South African water and sanitation department of several breaches including seriously contaminating a local river, storing hazardous waste in open containers and failing to fix broken walls at a sewage facility.\n\nResidents at Phola say they don\u2019t trust the local water supply. Daisy Tshabangu, 52, moved to Phola because her family worked at the coal-fired power station that looms on the horizon. \u201cMost of the people, when they do drink this water they get stomach aches,\u201d she said.\n\nPhola residents say they feel abandoned by the companies whose mines dominate the landscape. Unemployment is high and infrastructure is crumbling.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t benefit from the mines,\u201d said Tshabangu. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t have but we are surrounded by mines. So to us, it seems like we are being sidelined as a community.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Daisy Tshabangu lives in Phola, which is surrounded by three mining complexes run by Glencore. She says her community feels like it is being sidelined. Photograph: Julia Evans/Daily Maverick\n\nGlencore says that its water treatment plant supplies clean water to Phola as part of its \u201ccommitment to sustainable development\u201d. It says it is not directly responsible for the overall supply of water and cannot comment on claims about water quality. It says it has had no complaints via a grievance procedure regarding the supply of water.\n\nDespite repeated requests to clean up its operations, the Tweefontein mine was still in breach of multiple environmental laws as recently as November 2023, an inspection report by the South African water and sanitation department reveals. Campaigners question why the company\u2019s licence has not been revoked.\n\n\u201cOur regulators are often compromised and give in to the pressure of the coal mining industry. [They] do not have the political will to enforce our laws,\u201d said Mariette Liefferink, chief executive of the Federation for a Sustainable Environment, a local campaign group.\n\nAngered that finance promoted as sustainable is supporting Glencore, Liefferink wrote to the former Labour MP Chuka Umunna in November last year about the environmental risk, ecological degradation and pollution associated with JP Morgan\u2019s investments in Glencore. Umunna is now head of sustainable solutions and head of green economy for investment banking at JP Morgan. However, the Observer understands that the former shadow secretary of state for business, who did not respond to the letter, is involved only in the activities of the investment bank, and is not involved in and does not have oversight over the sustainable policies of the asset management arm.\n\nLiefferink urged the bank to review its investments in Glencore due to the company\u2019s alleged breaking of environmental laws, as well as the pollution, wildlife damage and environmental risk its activities were causing. Liefferink\u2019s correspondence highlighted two JP Morgan funds with ESG in their name, both of which had millions of pounds invested in Glencore.\n\nAfter a rapid rise in popularity, ESG investing is the subject of increasing scrutiny around the world. Regulators are trying to settle on what it means, and create labels that are easy for investors to understand.\n\nThe Mpumalanga mines form a small part of Glencore\u2019s global operations. It is the world\u2019s fifth biggest coal miner, selling more than 100m tonnes in 2023 \u2013 including from the Cerrej\u00f3n mine in Colombia where there have been allegations of human rights abuses and environmental destruction.\n\nGlencore says it is committed to responsible engagement and the wellbeing of all workers, and that mitigating negative impacts of its mines is imperative to building trust with local communities, which it maintains through ethical and responsible business practices. The company said the water supply in Phola is a municipal service, but that it contributes to a reservoir that also receives water from other sources. It said it monitors the quality of the water provided by its treatment plant on a weekly basis to ensure it is suitable for consumption.\n\nThe company said it has been taking action in response to Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) inspections since 2017 and that incidents identified in the 2023 audit have been addressed.\n\n\u201cOur industrial assets are closely linked to the communities and regions where they operate. We aim to avoid harm to people from our activities, respect human rights, and establish and maintain trusting relationships with stakeholders, through ethical and responsible business practices,\u201d the company said.\n\nJP Morgan declined to comment.\n\nThis investigation was supported by the Bertha Challenge fellowship; Stefano Valentino is a 2024 Bertha Challenge Fellow.

            "content": "It isn't easy to get enthusiastic about a stock just after it reaches its all-time high. This has been the case recently with U.S. megabank JPMorgan Chase (JPM 3.08%), which reached such a peak in mid-February but has generally been sliding since.\n\nPrice isn't everything, of course, and the big lender has a lot going for it as an investment. Here's my take on its chances of climbing back up to, or even surmounting, that historically hefty price.\n\nSecond to none\n\nJPMorgan Chase happens to be the No. 1 bank in the country by several measures, easily topping the rest of the three other big lenders (Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo). Its assets totaled more than $4 trillion (distant second place belonged to BofA's $3.26 trillion), its latest quarterly revenue was nearly $43 billion, and market cap was more than $720 billion.\n\nJPMorgan Chase knows how to leverage its size, reach, and power to keep producing impressive fundamentals.\n\nPresaging the record share price it would notch the following month, in January the bank set all-time highs for annual revenue and net income, at more than $177 billion and $58 billion, respectively, in 2024. Both grew at double-digit percentage rates from the 2023 numbers, specifically 12% for revenue and 18% for profitability.\n\nThe bank managed these feats in no small part because of top-line increases in all three of its main divisions. Its core consumer and community banking unit was up 2% over 2023, while the commercial and investment bank and asset and wealth management segments both improved at a brisk 9% pace.\n\nBasically if there's money to be made in any corner of American finance, JPMorgan Chase is happy and eager to make it. For example, it was (once again) No. 1 in a crucial means of payment. According to data from Nilson Report cited in recent research by The Motley Fool, the company was the top credit card issuer in terms of total purchase volume at $1.2 trillion in 2023.\n\nAnchored by a famous brand\n\nSome might consider brick-and-mortar physical business locations to be old-fashioned (or even obsolete), but branding and presence still matter in the banking business.\n\nThe JPMorgan Chase operation most familiar to the public, Chase Bank, is (it should go nearly without saying by now) No. 1 in terms of geographic reach, too. According to Statista, in 2024 the bank had 5,110 outlets in the country, well ahead of No. 2 with 4,349 (Wells Fargo, if you're curious).\n\nWhat helps is longevity and familiarity; through booms and busts, depressions and financial crises, the Chase brand has endured since 1877. Any financial institution that lasts so long garners both familiarity and trust. If you stash your money with Chase, it will still be there whenever you feel like coming back for it.\n\nThat alone is a draw for all types of customers, be they individual or corporate. Mixed with the company's very wide range of products and services, in the eyes of many JPMorgan Chase is a trusted provider of any significant financial product they might want or require.\n\nSo ultimately I think that, as long as the U.S. economy continues to chug along, JPMorgan Chase will continue to do well. Analysts are modeling comparatively modest growth next year from 2025, with average estimated revenue growth of a bit less than 4% and per-share earnings improvement of nearly 7%.\n\nI feel those pundits might be underestimating the lender's ability to make a buck (and to top estimates, which it does frequently). This is a powerhouse of a bank, and I'd go as far as to say one of the best. I can easily imagine its price rising to more than $270, and ultimately notching new all-time highs.",

            "content": "Analysts suggest that value stocks tend to hold up relatively well during economic downturns. During recessions, investors often become more risk-averse and seek out stable, resilient investments, which frequently include value stocks. A report by GMO examined the performance of undervalued stocks during US recessions since 1969, using valuation metrics such as price-to-book, price-to-earnings, Composite Value, and a combination of value models within their Opportunistic Value strategies. While the firm does not recommend constructing portfolios based solely on traditional price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratios, the report found that even these simple metrics have historically performed fairly well during recessions. Notably, all value models\u2014except price-to-book\u2014delivered stronger returns during recessionary periods (including the COVID-19 downturn) than in non-recession months over the past 55 years.\n\nDuring the high-inflation environment of 2022, value stocks declined by 7%, whereas growth stocks saw a steeper drop of 28.6%. Furthermore, value stocks in the US posted their strongest relative performance against growth stocks since the dot-com crash of 2000.\n\nAn analysis of historical trends suggests that undervalued stocks have delivered stronger long-term returns. Research conducted by Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago and Kenneth French of Dartmouth College highlighted that stocks with lower price-to-book ratios outperformed the broader market index between 1963 and 1990, according to Oakmark Funds. Their findings also noted that growth investors often favored companies with exciting prospects, while value investors focused on more traditional, overlooked stocks. In the long run, value investors tended to see better results.\n\nIn 2024, several major tech companies surprised investors by announcing their first-ever dividend payments. Traditionally, technology firms reinvest billions annually to fuel growth, leading to the perception that they rarely distribute dividends. However, as more large-cap companies prioritize enhancing shareholder returns, a balanced approach\u2014focusing on both income generation and stock appreciation\u2014is increasingly becoming the norm. The market has been experiencing uncertainty in recent days, leaving investors concerned about its future direction. Given this unpredictability, a wise strategy is to consistently invest in high-quality dividend stocks when they are attractively priced, rather than attempting to time market fluctuations.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against other best affordable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDividend stocks have underperformed in recent years, largely due to the rising hype surrounding AI-related investments. Despite this, analysts continue to favor dividend stocks for their strong long-term potential. Morningstar\u2019s chief US market strategist, Dave Sekera, recently shared insights on their future outlook and current valuation. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thinking that dividend stocks are a good place to be in the first half of the year, where you can at least capture some of those high dividends for the next couple of quarters. I also like that those stocks are going to be lower in duration. So if we do have interest rates continuing to climb, those would perform better. And of course, then we also have the unknowns of exactly what a Trump presidency is going to bring here in the first quarter and even into the second quarter. So I think that there is probably more downside risks of the market in the short term than upside risk. So therefore, I like a lot of these dividend stocks, which of course are more often than not in the value category.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create this list, we screened for dividend stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 25, as of February 26. Then, we picked companies from that list that have a reliable history of paying dividends consistently to their shareholders. We ranked the resulting list based on the number of hedge fund investors who held stakes in these companies, as per the Q4 2024 data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) the Best Affordable Dividend Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 123\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of February 26: 14.01\n\nAn American multinational financial services company, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) offers services in commercial banking, financial transaction processing, and asset management. In FY24, the company posted record earnings, with annual profits rising 18% year-over-year to $58.5 billion. This growth was largely fueled by its investment banking and trading divisions, which capitalized on a market recovery in the fourth quarter. However, net interest income (NII) declined 3% year-over-year in Q4 2024 to $23.5 billion, marking its first drop since 2021.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has maintained a strong reputation as a top dividend stock, consistently paying dividends since 1972. In the most recent quarter, it reinforced its commitment to shareholder returns by distributing $3.5 billion in dividends. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.25 per share, with a yield of 1.93% as of February 26.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has accumulated significant excess capital, equivalent to roughly 10% of its market capitalization while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Although share buybacks are a lower priority, it repurchased $6.36 billion worth of stock in Q3 2024. As economic conditions improve, the company is expected to ease its cash reserves and return more capital to shareholders over time.\n\nOverall, JPM ranks 1st on our list of best affordable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for JPM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JPM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

I shouldn\u2019t get angry and stuff like that,\u201d he admitted.\n\nThe leaked audio, originally obtained by the American financial publication, Barron\u2019s, featured Dimon venting his frustration over workplace attendance resistance, lamenting that he couldn\u2019t find a \u201cgod-d\u2013 person\u201d on Fridays and criticizing the lack of engagement during \u201cf\u2013ing Zoom\u201d meetings. He also dismissed a petition signed by over 1,700 employees opposing the bank\u2019s in-office mandate.\n\nDespite the mea culpa over his language, Dimon remains unwavering on JPMorgan\u2019s return-to-office policy, which will require employees to be in-office five days a week starting March 3. He brushed off criticism, asserting that while remote work might be preferable for some employees, it\u2019s not up to them.\n\n\u201cThey can get a job\u2014I\u2019m not being mean\u2014they can get a job elsewhere,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cI totally understand that it may make total sense for them to do that.\u201d\n\nHis comments have drawn sharp reactions from JPMorgan employees. As reported by Fortune, Nicholas Welch, a tech operations analyst at JPMorgan, claimed he faced threats to his job after suggesting that teturn-to-work policies should be determined by team managers rather than a blanket mandate.\n\nDimon addressed speculation that employees faced retaliation for questioning the policy, asserting, \u201cI have never, ever fired anyone because they asked a question like that.\u201d\n\nBeyond RTO, Dimon also took aim at JPMorgan\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.\n\nIn another leaked recording obtained by Bloomberg, the CEO had expressed frustration over certain initiatives, saying, \u201cI saw how we were spending money on some of this stupid s\u2014, and it really pissed me off. I\u2019m just gonna cancel them. I don\u2019t like wasted money in bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nClarifying his stance to CNBC, Dimon insisted he wasn\u2019t scrapping DEI efforts but rather trimming ineffective programs that relied too much on outside consultants. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to reach out to the black, Hispanic, LGBT, veteran, and disabled communities. We\u2019re not changing that,\u201d he said.",

That\u2019s your right. It\u2019s my right. It\u2019s a citizen\u2019s right. But they should respect that the company is going to decide what\u2019s good for the client, the company, etcetera \u2013 not the individual,\u201d he was quoted as saying by CNBC at the company\u2019s global leveraged finance conference in Miami.\n\nHowever, he stood firm on his return to office stance and said that he is against work from home where it does not work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll understand that. And I also respect that other companies are going to try a different way to grow,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not against work from home. I\u2019m against where it doesn't work\u201d, Dimon added.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey can get a job\u2014I\u2019m not being mean\u2014they can get a job elsewhere. I totally understand that it may make total sense for them to do that.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | JP Morgan Chase India appoints Pranav Chawda as CEO after RBI approval\n\nShould never curse, says JP Morgan CEO The JP Morgan Chase CEO said he regretted his foul-mouthed rant while also clarifying that he stood firm on his opinion about returning to work from office.\n\n\u201cI do town halls all around the world, and as you know, I mope sometimes. I should never curse, ever,\u201d he said.\n\nHe agreed that he should not get angry but justified that he was trying to give a detailed answer to the employee who asked about reconsidering the return to office policy.\n\n\u201cI shouldn't get angry or stuff like that. But the gentleman asked a long question, and I answered the question. I tried to give a lot of detail, which I think he\u2019s entitled to because I\u2019ve never, ever fired anyone because they asked a question like that,\u201d CNBC quoted him as saying.\n\nWhat happened at the JP Morgan town hall? At an earlier company event, leaked audio revealed Dimon using several expletives towards an employee who asked him to reconsider the policy of returning to the office five times a week. The employee cited personal issues and the overall needlessness of working from the office for his team. He asked Dimon to leave the decision of remote work to managers, which angered the CEO.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t waste time on it. I don\u2019t care how many people sign that f****** petition,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Jamie Dimon, the CEO of banking heavyweight JPMorgan, has acknowledged the importance of smart contracts-based cryptocurrencies, in stark contrast to his views on Bitcoin BTC/USD.\n\nWhat happened: During a CNBC interview in January 2023, the CEO of the world's most valuable banking company stated that cryptocurrencies with embedded smart contracts possess value.\n\n\"There's a cryptocurrency which might actually do something. Think of a cryptocurrency that has an embedded smart contract in it and that we can use it to buy and sell real estate and move data. That may have value,\u201d he said.\n\nIt's important to understand the difference. While Bitcoin is commonly used as a digital currency for transactions and a store of value, blockchains like Ethereum ETH/USD enable the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nThis is the reason why a plethora of decentralized exchanges, banks, and tokenization platforms are built atop Ethereum.\n\nSee Also: GameStop-Themed Cryptos Soar After Vivek Ramaswamy Co-Founded Firm\u2019s CEO Urges Bitcoin Investment: Graduate From Being \u2018Meme Stock\u2019 To Sector Leader\n\nDimon's views hold weight as JPMorgan has made significant investments in ETH through spot exchange-traded funds.\n\nEthereum ETFs began trading on U.S. exchanges in July of last year. According to a 13F filing, the bank owned a combined stake worth $39,695 in Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF ETHE, Fidelity Ethereum Fund FETH, and iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ETHA.\n\nETFs Owned Shares Held Market Value Effective Date Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF 1,046 $29,309 Dec. 31, 2024 iShares Ethereum Trust ETF 300 $7,587 Dec. 31, 2024 Fidelity Ethereum Fund 80 $2,673 Dec. 31, 2024 Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF 4 $126 Dec. 31, 2024\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Dimon hasn\u2019t publicly endorsed Ethereum or any specific smart contract-based cryptocurrency, for that matter. Benzinga reached out to JPMorgan to understand if the ETF investments were shaped by Dimon\u2019s views. The bank didn\u2019t immediately respond to the inquiry.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Ethereum was exchanging hands at $$2,143.26, down 7.25% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The cryptocurrency has plunged over 30% in the last month.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nRead Next:",

(NYSE:JPM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nLast Wednesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, questioned whether the market was still following a clear and predictable business cycle, suggesting there were \u201chuge conflicting currents\u201d that made the economy difficult to navigate. Reflecting on his early days in the industry, Cramer explained that back then, understanding the business cycle was important.\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Suggested Buying These 8 Stocks on Weakness and Jim Cramer Talked About These 12 Stocks Recently\n\n\u201cIf business was too strong, the Fed might raise rates, pull things off. If business was too weak, you might have some rate cuts. You always had to pay attention to these things, right, because you didn\u2019t wanna fight the Fed.\u201d\n\nBut on that particular day, with the Dow gaining 71 points, the S&P advancing by 0.24% to reach a new all-time record, and the Nasdaq edging up by 0.07%, Cramer began to reconsider whether the traditional concept of the business cycle had become outdated.\n\nCramer went on to highlight the puzzling movements in specific sectors, especially food and beverage and drug stocks, which showed some unexpected gains. These industries, often seen as immune to economic cycles, seemed to defy the typical patterns.\n\nHe pointed out that in light of the current administration\u2019s stance on food policy, especially with a health and human services secretary who has expressed disdain for processed foods and vaccinations, it was not just a cycle affecting these sectors anymore, it felt more like a targeted attack on the industries themselves. Cramer wondered, \u201cWhat if RFK Jr. wakes up tomorrow and says, \u2018I\u2019m banning Fruit Loops\u2019 or stopping weight loss shots?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, everyone in this administration seems to think that the federal government could do whatever it wants. That\u2019s not, that\u2019s not how our system works or at least it\u2019s not how the Constitution says it works, but the blight\u2019s very much with us, even with today\u2019s reprieve.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 19. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.",

Read our privacy policy\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says he regrets his foul-mouthed tirade on working from home earlier this month.\n\n\"I do town halls all around the world and as you know I mope sometimes. I should never curse, ever,\" he said during a CNBC interview Monday at the financial giant\u2019s global leveraged finance conference in Miami Beach.\n\nHe added: \"I shouldn't get angry or stuff like that. But the gentleman asked a long question and I answered the question. I tried to give a lot of detail which I think he\u2019s entitled to because I\u2019ve never, ever fired anyone because they asked a question like that.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Dimon was heard on leaked audio from a town hall answering a staffer\u2019s question about a petition circulating within the company, asking bosses to rethink their plan to order workers back to the office on a more permanent basis.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t waste time on it. I don\u2019t care how many people sign that ******* petition,\u201d he said during the meeting.\n\nAfter the heated rant, the CEO weighed in on the fact that employees had a \u201cchoice [on] whether to work at JPMorgan\u201d and pleaded with staff not to \u201cbe mad at him.\u201d He went on to mention that they were free to work anywhere.\n\nIn the CNBC interview, Dimon said that he felt his negative feelings towards working from home were overblown.\n\n\u201cI completely respect people that don\u2019t want to go to the office all five days a week. That\u2019s your right. It\u2019s my right. It\u2019s a citizen\u2019s right. But they should respect that the company is going to decide what\u2019s good for the client, the company, etcetera \u2013 not the individual.\u201d\n\nAdmitting that his policy drew criticism and support from all sides he said: \u2018For the most part, people understand why we want to do it\u2019 ( AFP via Getty Images )\n\nHe reiterated his previous assertions that his employees were welcome to get a job elsewhere if they weren\u2019t happy about that, adding \u201cI\u2019m not being mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll understand that. And I also respect that other companies are going to try a different way to grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not against work from home. I\u2019m against where it doesn't work,\u201d he added.\n\nDimon said he believes he has already declared his reasonings, as per the revelation a few weeks ago, citing the petition.\n\nHe doubled down on his stance explaining that employees were entitled to feel disgruntled about the notion but said that his company would remain defiant and its position would not change.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, people understand why we want to do it,\u201d he concluded.\n\nSeveral Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have advocated for the return-to-office policy, arguing that it fosters better learning, company innovation, and workplace culture.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump also signed an executive order at the start of his second term, demanding that all federal government workers return to working in person on a full-time basis.\n\nUnder Dimon\u2019s leadership, the bank\u2019s profits surged to record numbers in 2024 with a share price that nearly doubled in the past five years \u2013 without enforcing the stringent measures.\n\nThe Independent contacted JP Morgan Chase for comment.\n\nHave you been affected by this story?

Our hiring is merit-based,\" a spokesperson told Fox News Digital.\n\nThe spokesperson\u2019s comments come after the bank\u2019s CEO Jamie Dimon has appeared to waver on his commitment to DEI amid the Trump administration\u2019s onslaught against the policies. During a January CNBC interview in Davos, Dimon said \"bring them on\" in reference to anti-DEI activists targeting his bank. But during a recent company townhall, the CEO appeared to criticize many of the company\u2019s DEI programs.\n\n\n\n\"I saw how we were spending money on some of this stupid s--t, and it really pissed me off. I\u2019m just going to cancel them. I don\u2019t like wasted money in bureaucracy,\" Dimon said, before telling employees he was never a \"firm believer\" in bias training.\n\nJPMORGAN'S NEW NYC HEADQUARTERS TO OFFER JAW-DROPPING EMPLOYEE PERKS\n\nThe financial institution has also scrubbed its latest SEC filing of almost any mention of DEI programs \u2013 save for one section in which the investment bank warned that it expects to be \"criticized by activists, politicians and other members of the public\" for its DEI policies.\n\nJPMorgan's 2023 filing listed diversity, equity and inclusion in a section entitled \"Firm culture\" and pointed to its business resource groups which the filing defined as \"groups of employees who support JPMorgan Chase\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion strategies by leveraging the unique perspectives of their members.\"\n\nMorgan also disclosed their DEI \"centers of excellence\" which work to achieve the bank\u2019s DEI objectives with career coaching and other services. The Centers of Excellence are mentioned in this year\u2019s filing but are no longer listed as a DEI program.\n\n\"We regularly review and make appropriate adjustments to policies and programs, including around the Supreme Court decision in 2023,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAs the Trump administration continues to crack down on DEI one Wall Street firm after another has turned on the controversial practices. Goldman Sachs announced they would no longer deny IPO services to companies with all-White boards, and Citigroup dropped their diversity hiring metrics.\n\nJAMIE DIMON SLAMS ANTI-RTO MOVEMENT: 'I DON'T CARE HOW MANY PEOPLE SIGN THAT F---ING PETITION'\n\nTrump referred to DEI programs as \"illegal and immoral discrimination programs\" in his executive order banning them from federal agencies. However, JPMorgan\u2019s spokesperson insists that the bank is not discriminating, and is simply trying to expand \"opportunity\" to their customers.\n\n\"The moniker means different things to different people.

            "content": "JPMorgan Chase has spent billions to become a technology-driven bank.\n\nNow, due to the bank's RTO stance, some of its tech workers are considering leaving.\n\nRecruiters and insiders lay out how its policy could spell trouble for retaining its top tech talent.\n\nAnthony has never been interested in attending town halls, but when texts started rolling in about his top boss' remote work diatribe, it was too much for the technology vice president to ignore.\n\nAn IT employee named Nicolas Welch had questioned JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon while he was visiting an office in Columbus, Ohio, about leaving some return-to-office decisions up to managers. Dimon launched into an expletive-laced response, in which he complained about employees not paying attention on Zoom and that there's \"not a goddamn person\" he could get a hold of on Fridays.\n\nThe audio of the exchange went viral. It also struck a nerve, and now some employees are considering leaving, teaming up to influence work policy, or, like Anthony, entertaining job offers from rival banks.\n\n\"Jamie Dimon's like, 'Well, hey, if you don't like it, you know where the door is.' Yes, we do,\" said Anthony, which is a pseudonym to protect his identity since he was not authorized to speak about internal matters. \"And that's going to impact him. He's going to lose some good people.\"\n\nJPMorgan has long prided itself on being a tech-driven bank, with a $17 billion IT budget and nearly 60,000 technology workers. To stay ahead of its rivals and keep clients engaged, it funds research and development across cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and crypto.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with two recruiters and five JPMorgan employees, four of whom requested anonymity for fear of losing their jobs, who said the bank's unpopular RTO mandate could spell trouble for the bank's ability to retain and attract tech talent. Dimon has espoused the merits of in-person collaboration, but support for the RTO plan was scarce among those interviewed by BI.\n\nAs the March 3 expiration date for hybrid work approaches, Dimon has said he's aware that his hardline stance could push some employees away and is fine with that attrition.\n\n\"I completely respect people that don't want to go to the office all five days a week. That's your right. It's my right. It's a citizen's right,\" Dimon said in a CNBC interview Monday. \"But they should respect that the company is going to decide what's good for the clients, the company, etc., not an individual.\"\n\nWhile 70% of the bank's 317,233 employees are already in the office five days a week, technology workers are part of the contingent still working one or two days at home.\n\nThe battle for technical talent \u2014 which tends to be industry-agnostic \u2014 was long fought using perks, with companies providing lavish extras like fancy food, massages, and even paid family planning services to keep workers happy and attract new ones. With many of those falling away as companies focus on cost cutting, recruiters say hybrid work is emerging as the strongest benefit a company can offer.\n\nRyan Mazza, who runs the New York office of the financial-talent search firm Selby Jennings, said he had \"no doubt\" that there would be talent attrition among companies that impose a five-day RTO. \"There will certainly be a competitive disadvantage for those companies,\" he said.\n\nCompanies with flexible working policies have quickly distinguished themselves from the wave of their competitors pulling employees back to the office. Spotify plastered its message on a Times Square billboard in early January, saying its employees aren't children and it was sticking with remote work. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser maintained her pledge to hybrid work this month, as did the fintech Revolut.\n\nWelch, the tech operations analyst who triggered Dimon's testy comments, said the town hall roused employees rather than quieted them. The RTO decision has pushed some workers to explore the possibility of a union and organizing a unified response.\n\n\"People are absolutely emboldened. I don't know fully what that means yet,\" he said.\n\nJPMorgan declined requests for comment.\n\nTech behemoth of Wall Street\n\nJPMorgan's technology footprint is massive by a few measures. The bank employs about 44,000 software engineers globally who run more than 6,000 applications and manage about an exabyte (1 billion gigabytes) of data. That engine of people, systems, and data has helped the bank bring in record financial results, with its net income rising to $59 billion for 2024.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe bank also has big AI ambitions, with Dimon saying he has no intention of losing the AI arms race to disruptors. It has created a robust AI research department led by a former Carnegie Mellon researcher, Manuela Veloso, and has earned the top spot on the Evident AI Index, an independent benchmark for AI adoption and performance in finance.\n\nMike Mayo, a Wells Fargo analyst who regularly grills Dimon on earnings calls, last year called JPMorgan the \"Nvidia of banking,\" commenting on its tech spend outpacing that of any other bank.\n\nReputation and prestige only go so far, said Deepali Vyas, the global head of the data, AI, and fintech practice at the headhunting firm Korn Ferry. She said she'd seen other companies fail to hire cloud, data, and AI talent purely because of their return-to-office policies.\n\n\"The challenge for banks is that top tech talent has options,\" Vyas said, adding: \"If firms insist on a rigid in-office structure without a compelling trade-off, they risk losing talent to more agile, innovation-friendly environments.\" Vyas added that she knew of a very senior-level managing director within JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank who told her they're considering quitting because of the return to office.\n\nA JPMorgan executive director overseeing data scientists and data engineers, a key hiring area for the bank and its AI ambitions, said he's worried about losing talent to the in-office order.\n\n\"Taking away a hybrid schedule, I honestly think, shrinks our talent pool even more,\" the executive director said. \"I wonder how many people were already on the fence in comparison to other opportunities but now said, 'Forget this. I don't want to be forced into an office.'\"\n\nWhile JPMorgan made headlines with its return-to-office policy, remote work has steadily tightened across corporate America. Wall Street bosses such as Goldman Sachs' David Solomon and Citadel's Ken Griffin pulled workers back to the office in 2021. Big Tech companies, including Amazon, Dell, and AT&T, have more recently piled into the effort.\n\nSelby Jennings' Mazza said he's already seeing pay demands increase for finance-sector jobs over the industry's return to office. Tech workers who are considering these jobs are demanding $5,000 or $10,000 in added pay to cover childcare or offset commuting costs, he said.\n\nWhile some JPMorgan employees, including Anthony, are already in talks with prospective new employers, recruiters said they didn't see a mass exodus of talent coming overnight as today's tech job market favors employers.\n\nDown the line, though, the bank's RTO demands and execution could come back to bite it.\n\n\"Once that turns, even if the pendulum starts swinging just a little bit the other way, and this includes JPMorgan and all those other guys,\" Korn Ferry's Vyas said, referring to Amazon, Dell, and Salesforce, among others, the top performers \"will be the first people that leave for that benefit.\"\n\n'Rushed and unplanned'\n\nQuestioning one of the most powerful people on Wall Street has raised Welch's profile within JPMorgan. Welch, who supports network equipment inside Chase branches, joked he's going to have to buy a wrist brace for the number of high-fives he gets walking down the hall. A stranger even gave him a mockingjay pin, a nod to the dystopian \"Hunger Games\" movie series wherein the pin becomes a symbol of rebellion.\n\nNicolas Welch, the tech operations analyst who questioned Jamie Dimon about the bank's return to office mandate. Nicolas Welch\n\nA story about Welch getting fired before the move was rescinded, reported by Fortune, has caught the attention of other employers. He said he'd received multiple job offers in the past week. It's a moot point: \"Why would I want to work somewhere else? Chase is the best,\" he said.\n\nBut Welch, who works three days a week out of JPMorgan's Polaris campus in Columbus, is still a critic of the firm's plans. One reason is that he advocates for a hybrid schedule for employees like himself who help care for family members.\n\n\"I live with my mom. She is 68. She can't reach the top shelf,\" Welch said. \"She needs help with stuff, and I'm here to do that, you know? I can turn around and go do a thing and come back to work. Why wouldn't I want to do that?\"\n\nHome to more than 19,000 employees across 13 buildings, Polaris also boasts the fourth-highest-grossing Starbucks. The campus has been key to several tech initiatives, like overhauling its deposit system on the public cloud and developing edge cloud computing for faster data analysis.\n\nEmployees BI talked to said that offices didn't have enough desks, parking, or conference rooms and that office caf\u00e9s wouldn't be ready for the increased RTO traffic.\n\nIn the January memo about the call back to the office, the bank's operating committee acknowledged that not all office locations would be ready for the March 3 deadline and said more information would be shared by the end of the month. The committee added that some offices had capacity restraints and timelines for those would become available on a location-by-location basis.\n\nBut as of late February, many workers said they were still waiting for an update. For example, Polaris-based staff have yet to be told when they'll be called into the office.\n\nThe \"messaging feels rushed and unplanned,\" the data executive director said.\n\nMeanwhile, one analyst whose office permanently closed during the pandemic and was designated a fully remote worker has been left in the lurch about whether they'll have a job in March.\n\n\"I've only been told that it's business as usual until I'm told otherwise. I was, however, advised by my manager as a friend to consider putting feelers out for new roles elsewhere,\" the analyst said.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, many have been given their marching orders, and some question: What's the point?\n\n\"Just because you bring people back into the office doesn't mean you're not going to have Zoom calls,\" a software manager in Ohio said. \"The whole collaboration thing is utter bullshit in my mind because I'm still going to be getting on Zoom calls. The only difference is, two of the people I'm on Zoom calls with might be sitting right beside me,\" the technologist, who works with people in Texas and Singapore, said.\n\nPutting gasoline on a fire\n\nThe aftermath of the RTO rollout has stoked a fire within some JPMorgan employees to unionize.\n\n\"They anticipated this was coming,\" Nick Weiner told BI about JPMorgan employees' RTO expectations. Weiner is a senior campaign lead for Communications Workers of America who has led the effort of some 25 Wells Fargo branches in unionizing. He told BI that he had been in touch with JPMorgan workers for a similar effort.\n\n\"The way he did it helped to really put gasoline on this fire,\" Weiner said of Dimon's town hall comments. Dimon has since said that he shouldn't have sworn.\n\nA petition against the in-office policy has garnered more than 1,700 signatures, and an internal Signal group counts about 200 members. Dimon said in the town hall he didn't care about how many people signed the petition, but that hasn't deterred workers.\n\nWelch participated in a meeting last week with other JPMorgan employees to learn more about the basics of the unionizing process, not because he dislikes his employer \u2014 \"even after cussing at me, I arguably have more respect for him,\" Welch said of Dimon \u2014 but because he loves it.\n\n\"A union is such a difficult thing to kind of even get going, but we love our jobs so much just in general that we're going to do that,\" Welch said. \"We want to be heard.

Photographer: Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nAccording to Dimon, JPMorgan is not entirely against remote work, with 10% of the bank's jobs operating on a fully remote basis \u2014 and staying that way even after the return-to-office mandate. For example, the bank has built virtual call centers in Baltimore and Detroit that collectively employ more than 100 remote workers.\n\nBut while working from home may make sense for virtual call centers, Dimon doesn't think it should apply to all JPMorgan employees. According to Bloomberg, 60% of JPMorgan staff, including managing directors and salespeople, are already at the office five days per week. The switch to fully in-person work in March affects back-office staff who currently work on a hybrid schedule.\n\n\"I'm not against work-from-home,\" Dimon told CNBC. \"I'm against where it doesn't work... We're not going to change. We're going back to the office.\"\n\nRelated: 'Feels Like a Slap in the Face': Some JPMorgan Employees Reportedly Aren't Happy With Their Bonuses\n\nJPMorgan first announced a strict return-to-office policy last month, with plans to implement it in March. Staff immediately flooded an internal website with over 300 comments calling out the policy's negative impact on their commute and work-life balance. Employees circulated a petition addressed to Dimon calling for hybrid work to be the default mode of work at the bank. The petition has received 1,803 signatures as of press time.\n\nJPMorgan is the largest bank in the U.S., with $3.9 trillion in assets.

Private credit is expected to become a $3 trillion business by 2028, the report said, citing data from Moody\u2019s.\n\nJPMorgan, the report adds, has in the last four years deployed over $10 billion across more than 100 private credit transactions, while also working with lending partners to allocate an additional $15 billion in private credit.\n\n\u201cPairing our vast origination platform with our lender client base has supercharged our ability to deliver in size for borrowers and increased deal flow for lenders,\u201d Kevin Foley, global head of capital markets at JPMorgan, told Reuters.\n\nAccording to Reuters, banks are increasingly also working with investment firms to push deeper into the private credit market. For example, Citigroup and Apollo last year launched a $25 billion private credit platform, while Wells Fargo in 2023 joined forces with investment firm Centerbridge Partners to issue loans to middle-market companies.\n\nAs covered here last week, JPMorgan was the only one of America\u2019s banking giants not to share details of its loans to non-bank entities with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\n\nThe advent of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) \u2014 otherwise known as shadow banks or non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs) \u2014 has attracted attention from regulators like the Fed, FDIC and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\n\u201cThe risks have been highlighted in recent months, and the risks transcend borders,\u201d PYMNTS wrote in late 2024.\n\nMonths earlier, Financial Stability Board Chair Klaas Knot warned that recent \u201cincidents of market stress and liquidity strains\u201d have been tied to NBFIs.\n\nMore recently, as PYMNTS wrote last week, the Federal Reserve announced plans for an \u201cexploratory analysis\u201d focused on \u201ccertain risks\u201d posed to banks by NBFIs, as the latter \u201coperate with high leverage and are dependent on funding from the banking sector.\u201d\n\nThose findings are set to be published in June and will take into account the impact of credit and liquidity shocks in the NBFI space during severe global recessions and \u201cmarket shocks\u201d that would accompany muted global economic activity and higher inflation expectations.",

The firm has teamed up with a group of co-lending partners, which have allocated nearly $15 billion more to the effort as well.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201ca number that we\u2019re totally comfortable going to, assuming the environment and the risk makes sense, which we think it does at the moment,\u201d Rohrbaugh said in an interview. \u201cIf we get there and we feel like we need to continue, there\u2019s certainly the capacity to do it.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan spent much of last year pulling together an initial group for the co-lending program, where it originates the loans and then invests in them alongside the other firms. The group currently comprises seven companies, according to people familiar with the matter, including FS Investments, Cliffwater, Shenkman Capital Management, Octagon Credit Investors and Soros Fund Management.\n\nRohrbaugh and Foley declined to give further details on the initiative. Bloomberg News previously reported on FS, Cliffwater and Shenkman partnering with JPMorgan. A representative for Octagon declined to comment. Representatives for Soros Fund Management didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s expanded effort underscores how banks are increasingly staking their claim in the $1.6 trillion market that had previously been the domain of asset managers and credit shops. As titans such as Blackstone Inc., Ares Management Corp. and Apollo Global Management Inc. pour money into ever-larger deals, the likes of JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have sought to defend their traditional lending turf with offerings of their own.\n\nJPMorgan is offering its direct-loan product to its vast network of middle-market clients as well as private equity sponsors, and has already done deals ranging from $50 million to $4.5 billion, according to the executives. With some clients opting for alternatives such as syndicated loans, JPMorgan can be \u201cproduct-agnostic\u201d by boosting its direct-loan capacity to provide offerings in conjunction with those traditional lending products, Foley said.",

She has been with the company for 34 years.\n\nChase announced that Becky Griffin will replace Burger as the company's top local executive. Griffin is the head of servicing and support operations for Chase Home Lending, a business dedicated to helping families achieve and sustain homeownership.\n\nBurger\u2019s business education began in the honors accounting program at Ohio State University, where she earned a Bachelor of Science in business administration. The Canton native spent six years at Deloitte in Phoenix as an audit manager and certified public accountant before moving back to Ohio in 1991 to work at Bank One.\n\nBurger was named Columbus CEO magazine's CEO of the year in 2023 for large for-profit companies. Chase employs more than 20,000 in the region, CEO Jamie Dimon said while visiting the community this month.\n\nBurger's career has included stints as controller for the retail division, controller for asset management and working as a member of the corporate accounting team for multiple mergers and acquisitions, including Washington Mutual Bank after it was seized by federal regulators during the Great Recession following a run on the bank.\n\nMore recently, Burger oversaw the renovation of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s regional headquarters on Polaris Parkway, which is also the world\u2019s largest Chase facility. The office features the second-largest solar power installation at a U.S. corporation.\n\nBurger last year was honored as a Columbus YWCA Woman of Achievement.\n\n\"Corrine has had an exceptional career,\" the company said in a statement. \"Her ability to lead and effect change has been instrumental in navigating the firm through many critical moments.\"\n\nBurger previously said her leadership style is to help people to do their jobs better, not to micromanage what they\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cOne of my big jobs is to help our teams remove roadblocks, so when I see things stalling, I tend to get personally involved,\u201d she told Columbus CEO last year.",

As per a Friday (Feb. 21) Reuters report, Javice, 31, has pleaded not guilty to securities fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy over JPMorgan\u2019s $175 million acquisition of her company in July 2021.\n\nThe prosecution alleges that Javice lied by telling the bank that Frank had 4.25 million customers when it had only about 300,000. JPMorgan claims it learned of the discrepancy when it tried to get in touch with customers it believed were legitimate to sell products, and got back far fewer responses than expected.\n\nHowever, Reuters reported, defense attorney Jose Baez said during his opening arguments that JPMorgan performed extensive due diligence into Frank, and knew how many customers it had before carrying out the purchase.\n\nHe said JPMorgan claimed it was tricked only a year later when financial aid regulations changed, and fraud was the only condition that allowed it to exit its contract with Frank.\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutor Rushmi Bhaskaran said during her opening argument that Javice collected phony names and addresses from a college friend after JPMorgan requested the data.\n\nBhaskaran added that Javice\u2019s co-defendant Olivier Amar, who was Frank\u2019s chief growth officer, purchased \u201csham lists\u201d of student data from third parties for Frank to falsely pass off as customers.\n\n\u201cIt was through their lies that they became multimillionaires,\u201d Bhaskaran said.\n\nJonathan Cogan, an attorney representing Amar, told jurors his client was \u201cout of the loop\u201d during negotiations with JPMorgan.\n\nAs PYMNTS wrote last week, the acquisition of Frank came around a year after JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the lender would be \u201cmuch more aggressive\u201d in how it approached acquisitions. The bank also began adding FinTechs with backgrounds in sustainable investing, robo-advising and constructing tax-efficient portfolios.\n\nJPMorgan Chase sued Javice in 2023, saying that she and Amar defrauded the bank by inflating its customer data. Dimon has called the Frank acquisition a \u201chuge mistake,\u201d the Reuters report noted.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 11 Best Performing Dow Stocks So Far in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against other best performing Dow stocks so far in 2025.\n\nThe Dow is a renowned and significant stock market index that measures the performance of 30 publicly traded businesses listed on US stock exchanges, representing a diverse variety of industries.\n\nAs of 20 February 2025, the index has steadily increased, rising 14.41% in the last 12 months and 4.21% year to date in 2025. It rose 8.04% over the last six months, mirroring its 8.04% gain in the previous month. Over the long term, it has risen 52.37% in the last five years and has returned an astounding 3,362.55% since 1985.\n\nIn comparison, the broader market has outpaced the Dow, gaining 22% in the last year and 4% year to date in 2025. The wider market has risen 8.84% during the last six months, with a 1.13% increase in the last month. Its long-term performance has been favorable, with a five-year gain of 83.28% and a remarkable 3,717.09% increase since 1996. Its superior performance is largely due to the strength of technology and high-growth stocks.\n\nNonetheless, the Nasdaq has led the market, climbing 28.12% in the last 12 months and 3.53% year to date in 2025. Over the last six months, the Nasdaq has gone up by 11.40%, with 1.04% growth in the last month. Over the last five years, it has surged by 108.45%, proving its dominance in high-growth sectors.\n\nWhile the Dow has fallen behind the other two markets in recent years, its consistency and solid historical returns underline its long-term investment appeal. The index typically has reduced volatility and concentrates on established blue-chip companies.\n\nAccording to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dow is still a dependable benchmark for US market performance, following 30 blue-chip businesses with strong reputations and consistent growth. Its price-weighted system ensures stability, typically reducing losses during downturns. The index has a historical association with broader markets, but it is less volatile than the broader market due to its emphasis on well-established firms. Despite its small size, the index has shown resilience in bear markets, such as 2009, while also reaping gains during bullish cycles. Its longstanding reputation and exposure to important industries make it a reliable predictor of economic strength.\n\nHowever, the Dow lost 0.6% on Thursday, February 20, 2025, as U.S. jobless claims surged faster than expected, heightening concerns about the labor market and the overall economic outlook. The wider market fell 0.5%, while the Nasdaq fell 0.7% in early trading, signaling broader market weakness. Investors reacted to economic data and shifting market sentiment as bond yields edged lower, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 4.52%.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe began with a pool of 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and identified stocks that have delivered positive returns in 2025 so far. We then picked the top 11 stocks with the highest Year-to-Date return as of February 14. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their year-to-date performance.\n\n\u201cWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\u201d\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nYear-to-date return as of February 14: 15.25%\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is among the biggest banks in the US. The business specializes in asset management, financial transaction processing, and commercial banking.\n\nOne of the best performing stocks, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) reported a record annual profit of $58.5 billion in FY24, an 18% rise from the year before, showing its remarkable performance. The bank\u2019s traders and dealmakers took advantage of a market recovery in the fourth quarter, which was a major factor in this growth. However, in Q4 2024, its net interest income (NII) dropped for the first time since 2021, falling 3% year over year to $23.5 billion.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has given stockholders a return of about 15% since the beginning of 2025, while the market as a whole has only returned 4%. Its emphasis on wealth management and investment banking has been substantially responsible for its success. Investment banking fees increased 49% in Q4 2024 compared to the prior year due to high customer engagement. As a result of record customer inflows that increased the assets under management, the Asset & Wealth Management division\u2019s net income increased by 25% to $1.5 billion.\n\nWells Fargo maintained its Overweight rating on JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) shares and increased its price target to $300 from $270 on February 7. Given market share growth, best-in-class performance, and what it views as the most favorable regulatory shift in three decades, the firm claims that the company symbolizes \u201cGoliath is Winning.\u201d According to Wells, the re-rating will be comparable to \u201cYear 1 in Trump 1.0.\u201d\n\nOverall, JPM ranks 3rd on our list of Best Performing Dow Stocks So Far in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential for JPM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "A jury has been selected in the trial of Charlie Javice. Luiz C. Ribeiro for NY Daily News via Getty Images\n\nA lawyer for Charlie Javice told jurors JPMorgan Chase didn't do enough to vet her startup.\n\nProsecutors said Javice defrauded JPMorgan Chase before it bought Frank.\n\nIn openings, prosecutors painted her as a fraud. Her lawyer called her an \"incredible young woman.\"\n\nProsecutors told a federal jury Thursday that Frank's founder Charlie Javice and her second in command, Olivier Amar, earned millions by defrauding JPMorgan Chase.\n\nThe bank purchased the company in 2021 for $175 million after the then-executives said Frank had more than 4 million users.\n\nProsecutors say that those numbers were dramatically inflated.\n\n\"They had nothing close to that,\" US Attorney Rushmi Bhaskaran said on Thursday in a Manhattan federal courtroom before District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein. \"Through these lies, the defendants became multimillionaires.\"\n\nBhaskaran added that the duo \"made up fake data\" to bolster their user base and then tried to cover it up.\n\nAttorneys for Javice and Amar, who were charged separately, painted a different picture.\n\nJose Baez, one of Javice's attorneys, said JPMorgan didn't do enough due diligence before purchasing Frank, calling it a \"business deal that went wrong.\"\n\nHe called Javice an \"incredible young woman\" who, at age 28, was savvy enough to secure a one-on-one meeting with Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's CEO.\n\nBaez added that the acquisition was more about acquiring Javice herself than Frank's users.\n\n\"They saw something in Charlie, a young female CEO breaking the glass ceiling,\" Baez said. \"That's what JPMorgan negotiated for, and that's what they got.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Amar's attorney, Jonathan Cogan, referred to his client as an \"innocent man\" who was dragged into his boss' problems after the prosecution \"lumped them together.\"\n\nAmar, who appeared stoic through much of the proceedings, nodded subtly while Cogan reminded the jury that he's innocent until proven guilty.\n\n\"Sometimes, our government gets it wrong,\" Cogan said. \"Sometimes, prosecutors can be overzealous. Sometimes, innocent people get swept up.\"\n\nOpening statements in the lower Manhattan trial came after nearly two days of jury selection.\n\nBefore being selected, jurors were questioned at hushed sidebars about their personal lives, including whether they had ever worked in finance, been a victim of fraud, or had close personal or business relationships with people such as Dimon.\n\nSome prospective jurors were excused after saying that they worked for JPMorgan or other banks. Another was excused after saying she enjoyed watching shows about scams and thinking about the psychology that motivates fraudsters.\n\n\"This is not an easy procedure. It was difficult. It took longer than I expected,\" Hellerstein said after the 12 jurors and 4 alternates were selected Thursday.\n\nThe jury and its alternates include people who told the judge they worked in sales management or IT, as well as some who worked for the city of New York. Others worked in healthcare or had no job.\n\nThroughout the voir dire process, Javice \u2014 dressed in a blouse and pencil skirt \u2014 smiled in the direction of jurors and took frequent notes. She appeared personable and chatted with the attorneys on each side of her, playing with her hair while talking.\n\nThe trial of Javice and Amar continues Friday.\n\nCorrection: February 21, 2025 \u2014 Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story misspelled the name of a defendant. Olivier Amar is on trial, not Oliver Amar.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

After graduating from the University of Liverpool he wrote for a number of British publications before joining AS USA in 2020. His work focuses on the Premier League, LaLiga, MLS, Liga MX and the global game.\n\nOne of America\u2019s biggest banks is making big changes after customers lost hundreds of millions of dollars in scams utilising the peer-to-peer payment system Zelle.\n\nFrom March JP Morgan Chase will begin blocking Zelle payments that are linked to social media contacts or online marketplaces. The bank may ask customers to specify the reason for the payment and the medium of communication, blocking any transaction that appears risky.\n\n\u201cTo help protect you from fraud and scams, the Zelle Service should be used for payments between friends, family, and others you trust and should not be used to pay for goods from recipients with whom you are not familiar,\u201d a new notice from JP Morgan Chase explained.\n\n\u201cThe Service is not intended, and should not be used, for the purchase of goods from retailers, merchants, or the like, including on or through social media or social media marketplaces or messaging apps.\u201d\n\nHow many customers got scammed with Zelle?\n\nLast year three of America\u2019s biggest banks - JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo - were sued for failing to prevent scammers operating on Zelle. A complaint from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused the banks, along with Zelle, of \u201callowing fraud to fester\u201d on the online payments platform.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the banks were worried about the impact that the burgeoning system could have on the financial industry and \u201cfailed to put in place proper safeguards\u201d to protect their own customers. Without\n\nThe complaint continues: \u201cDefendants\u2019 failures resulted in millions of complaints about Zelle fraud at (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) alone, including complaints of over $290 million in fraud losses by 210,000 Bank of America customers, over $360 million in fraud losses by 420,000 Chase customers, and over $220 million in fraud losses by 280,000 Wells Fargo customers.\u201d\n\nThe banks have rejected the accusations of malpractice in relation to the Zelle scandal, arguing that they are not responsible for the actions of scammers. JPMorgan Chase has labelled the suit a case of overreach from the CFPB.\n\n\u201cAs a last ditch effort in pursuit of their political agenda, the CFPB is now overreaching its authority by making banks accountable for criminals, even including romance scammers,\u201d JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Patricia Wexler said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s a stunning demonstration of regulation by enforcement, skirting the required rulemaking process.\u201d\n\nGet your game on!

Morgan subsidiaries and plaintiffs LHN Owner Urban Renewal, LLC and LHN II, LLC.\n\n\u201cLegal experts agree the lawsuit stands very little chance of success on the merits and serves as a nuisance suit to get JPMorgan what it was unable to achieve through negotiation with the redeveloper,\u201d wrote the city in a press release.\n\nFor their parts, the plaintiffs argue that the master deed called for the construction of a hotel, not residential housing and that any change would require both parties\u2019 consent because they have equal voting interests.\n\nThe Planning Board approved the 300-unit residential tower on Oct. 22. Courtesy of MHS Architecture.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, an arbitrator had sided with the developer in a partial finding, indicating the developer was \u201centitled\u201d to the 200 parking spaces.\n\nOver email, J.P. Morgan spokespeople wouldn\u2019t confirm the company\u2019s relationship to the LLCs nor any interest in the project or real estate in question. The company declined to comment on the mayor\u2019s statement. Their attorneys were not immediately available for comment.\n\nPlanning Board Chair Chris Langston declined to comment for this story. The Planning Board approved the site plan on Oct. 22 out of a belief it was adhering to the state\u2019s Municipal Land Use Law.\n\nThe mayor contends that the board acted legally because the project complies with a zoning amendment in the area\u2019s redevelopment plan, approved by the City Council, and which made way for the previously conceived 16-story hotel being replaced with the 30-story residential tower.\n\nThe Jersey City Redevelopment Agency previously designated Liberty Harbor North Partners, the defendant, as the redeveloper of the waterfront land. Planning board documents state that the partners scrapped the hotel plans because they were not financially feasible, and the residential use was more appropriate.\n\nRafael Salermo of Elizabeth and Scott Fields of Newark are listed as the majority owners of Liberty Harbor North Partners in board records.\n\nIn the press release, the agency echoed the mayor\u2019s criticism.\n\n\u201cWe are troubled by JPMorgan\u2019s most recent actions. We will continue to advocate for completing this noteworthy project,\u201d said JCRA Director Diana Jeffrey in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe City of Jersey City and its partners remain resolute in moving forward with the redevelopment and will explore all available legal options to ensure that the project proceeds. With a growing need for affordable housing, city officials stress the importance of removing unnecessary obstacles to progress,\u201d added the city\u2019s press release.",

            "content": "Good morning. A new documentary takes a look at how a job training program is preparing young adults for a shot at Fortune 500 internships, and the CEOs of these top companies share their perspectives.\n\nUntapped: Closing America's Opportunity Gap, is a documentary developed and executive produced by Workday (a CFO Daily sponsor) in partnership with The SpringHill Company founded by LeBron James and Maverick Carter. Carrie Varoquiers, Workday's chief philanthropy officer, served as an executive producer of the film. It debuted Wednesday on Netflix in the U.S. and shines a light on skills-based hiring as an alternative to degree requirements for jobs.\n\nI\u2019ve always been drawn to documentaries because they can be informative and entertaining at the same time. Untapped offers a compelling look at the stories of six young adults from underserved communities in New York City as they participate in a job skills training program through the nonprofit Year Up United that prepares them for an internship in corporate America.\n\n\"There are, and should be, different paths that can lead you to a successful career,\" according to Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach, who can attest to this firsthand: Rather than seeking out a four-year degree, he opted for technical school training instead. Eschenbach has since selected roles to build out his skills over the past 35 years in technology. \"Skills are the modern currency of work,\" he said.\n\nEschenbach is among the business leaders interviewed in the film including General Motors CEO Mary Barra, JPMorganChase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, Workday cofounder and executive chair Aneel Bhusri, entrepreneur Mark Cuban, and SpringHill\u2019s Maverick Carter.\n\n\"The new world of work is about skills, not necessarily degrees,\" according to Dimon. And part of that is removing the stigma of a community college and career education.\n\nIn the film, Dimon had this advice for CEOs: \u201cWe need to open our horizons, look at skills, and train people. You have these strategic visions but at the end of the day, jobs lead to dignity, health, homes, and families. It\u2019s a virtuous cycle.\u201d\n\nDimon also shares some of his own life experience, remarking that he was fortunate to have great parents and to go to a nice college, which gave him a \u201cleg up in life.\u201d And perhaps surprisingly for one of America's most prominent business leaders, Dimon says he never met a CEO until probably his last year in college.\n\nOn skills-based hiring, Barra said: \u201cI think we have to take it upon ourselves to widen the aperture of who we can hire, and then provide that training as people join the company.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, McMillon had this to say: \u201cSkills-based hiring and skills-based training are an important part of the country\u2019s economy and an important part of the future.\u201d\n\nAlong with commentary on hiring, the leaders offered career advice.\n\n\u201cWhen you get that first job, you\u2019re getting paid to learn,\u201d Cuban said. Look at it as an opportunity to build a foundation in the business world, he said. Cuban also shared an anecdote about purchasing his first suits, two for $99 made out of polyester, which he wore to interviews. \u201cThey're in a landfill somewhere standing up on their own,\u201d he quipped.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that 87% of companies are facing skill gaps or expect to within a few years. And just 38% of adults in the U.S. hold four-year degrees. A recent Harvard Business Review article argues that the \"logic of skills-based hiring is unimpeachable.\"\n\nThe film Untapped is very thought-provoking and brings insightful attention to the future of work. If you watch it, let me know what you think.\n\nHave a good weekend.\n\nSheryl Estrada\n\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

For example, access to Mastercard\u2019s Smart Payment Decisioning Tools lets them analyze the best time to initiate the payments based on the bill payer\u2019s transaction behavior and risk patterns, ensuring payments get made and reducing the risks of returns due to insufficient funds.\n\n\u201cFor consumers, pay-by-bank elevates the checkout experience, allowing billers to provide their customers with the option for a new, secure way to pay,\u201d the release adds.\n\nThe tool uses the consumer\u2019s authentication protocols with their bank to access the information needed to make a payment, letting them securely pay for things like rent, utilities, tuition, insurance and healthcare.\n\nThe release notes that Verizon will begin piloting the pay-by-bank tool in the months to come.\n\nPYMNTS examined the rise of pay-by-bank earlier this month in a conversation with Link Money CEO Eric Shoykhet.\n\nHe argued that, for the moment, open banking will be \u201coffering-driven,\u201d because \u201cconsumers in a lot of cases don\u2019t understand \u2014 or even know \u2014 about the solutions that either they\u2019re looking for or that some of these things are possible.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he added, \u201cit\u2019s going to be up to the key infrastructure providers and people in the value chain to push open banking-related use cases and products.\u201d\n\nAs that report notes, pay-by-bank is increasingly being increasingly embraced in the U.S. Merchants are promoting pay-by-bank because they have a strong incentive to reduce their payment processing costs by as much as 70% or 80%, said Shoyet.\n\nConsumers, meanwhile, are facing macroeconomic factors that drive them to open banking, with high interest rates on credit cards leading them to shift to debit transactions and pay-by-bank checkout offerings.",

For 2025, we forecast no special distributions following a more balanced 2024 cash cycle,\" the note said.\n\nAramco, which reports its 2024 results on March 4, has said it expects to declare total dividends of $124.3 billion for 2024, of which $43.1 billion would be performance-linked dividends.\n\nThe Saudi government, which directly holds nearly 81.5% of Aramco, relies on the company's payouts, which also include royalties and taxes. Its sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF)holds another 16% of Aramco and also benefits from its dividends as PIF spends tens of billions of dollars to try to steer the economy away from oil.\n\nThe government last year sold a chunk of its longtime cash cow to raise $12.35 billion from the second Aramco share offering after its record 2019 debut.\n\n(Reporting by Yousef Saba; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)",

Additionally, supportive crypto policies from U.S. President Donald Trump aren\u2019t likely to kick-in until the second half of this year, leaving crypto without any near-term catalysts.\n\nSlumping Demand\n\nLower demand from momentum-driven funds is also likely impacting demand for crypto currently, says JPMorgan. The price of BTC, the largest crypto by market capitalization, is presently at $98,320, down from a record high of $109,300 reached on Jan. 20 of this year, the date of Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nDespite the current slump, there was some positive news for the crypto sector with exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) announcing that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its enforcement case against the company. Analysts say dismissal of the Coinbase case will have long-term positive ramifications for other crypto enforcement cases and the industry as a whole.\n\nIs BTC a Buy?\n\nMost Wall Street firms don\u2019t offer ratings or price targets on Bitcoin, so we\u2019ll look at the cryptocurrency\u2019s three-month performance instead. As one can see in the chart below, the price of BTC has declined 0.79% in the last 12 weeks.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "JPMorgan will reclassify Kuwait and Qatar as developed markets and will soon begin their phased removal from its Emerging Markets Bond Index, from which the United Arab Emirates might also be removed next year.\n\nThe US-headquartered lender's EMBI tracks the performance of emerging market bonds \u2014 debt issued by countries with developing economies. These bonds typically carry higher risk but offer investors higher returns. The EMBI is closely followed by investors worldwide.\n\nIn a report released Thursday, JPMorgan\u2019s Global Index Research team said that Kuwait and Qatar will be removed from the EMBI in phases spanning a six-month period starting from March 31. The bank said that new bond issuances from these countries will no longer be included in the index.\n\nThe change will affect two bonds Qatar sold on Thursday through the Ministry of Finance: a three-year $1 billion bond priced at Treasuries +30 basis points, with a profit rate of 4.50%, and a 10-year $2 billion bond priced at UST +45, with a profit rate of 4.875%.\n\nQatar\u2019s US dollar bonds handed investors 0.8% in returns this year, Bloomberg reported. When compared to other emerging market bonds, Qatar\u2019s sovereign spread over US Treasuries is around 67 basis points, compared to the emerging market average of 317, meaning that Qatari bonds are lower risk compared to other emerging market sovereigns.\n\nMeanwhile, the bank said that the UAE\u2019s cost-of-living ratio has exceeded the EMBI\u2019s average for two years running, and if the Gulf state scores higher again in 2026, it will also be reviewed for removal from the list.\n\n\u201cAs investors we were waiting for this to happen,\u201d Anders Faergemann, co-head of emerging market global fixed income at UK-based Pinebridge Investments, told Bloomberg. \u201cOn paper, the investor base for Qatar and Kuwait will narrow by taking them out of the EM indices but we can still invest in both countries off benchmark.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a very healthy credit with a current account surplus \u2014 any external issuance won\u2019t be a concern,\u201d Faergemann added, saying that he had been making the case for Qatar to become a developing market credit for a while.\n\nWhy it matters: The JPMorgan emerging market cluster is closely watched by many investors and the loss of two investment-graded sovereigns will increase the average risk for the asset class.\n\nAs of Jan. 31, Qatar has a weighting of 3.2% and Kuwait 0.6% in the EMBI Global Diversified grouping, with UAE accounting for another 4.1%. Their removal would shift capital flows out of emerging markets and reduce opportunities for bond traders.\n\nThe US bank said the extra yield that investors demand to own emerging market bonds instead of US Treasuries \u2014 the benchmark safe haven asset \u2014 would widen by 11 basis points.\n\nKnow more: Despite the move from emerging to developing markets, both Kuwait and Qatar are projecting deficits for 2025.\n\nQatar approved a budget in December that projected a deficit of 13.2 billion riyals ($3.62 billion). However, last year, analysts from the Moody\u2019s Ratings agency said that the significant improvement in Qatar\u2019s financial metrics between 2021 and 2023 will be maintained in the medium term due to the government\u2019s fiscal prudence and the country\u2019s planned expansion of liquified natural gas slated for 2026 to 2028.\n\nKuwait\u2019s government said on Feb. 3 that it projects its budget deficit to rise by 11.9% to 6.31 billion dinars ($20.4 billion) for the fiscal year 2025-2026, up from the 5.6 billion-dinar ($18.2 billion) shortfall estimated for the current fiscal year.\n\nBloomberg reported on Jan. 30 that Kuwait may be able to sell debt for the first time since 2017, with the Council of Ministers set to approve a decree allowing the country to raise $65 billion over 50 years. Kuwait's previous debt law expired eight years ago and was not renewed due to tensions between the government and parliament around the OPEC member's heavy revenue reliance on oil prices and the resulting volatility.\n\nBut Kuwaiti Finance Minister Noura Al-Fassam told local media on Sunday that the debt law was \"now in its final stages\" and will help the country further develop infrastructure projects and support its capital expenditure.",

Hellerstein. \"Through these lies, the defendants became multimillionaires.\"\n\nBhaskaran added that the duo \"made up fake data\" to bolster their user base and then tried to cover it up.\n\nAttorneys for Javice and Amar, who were charged separately, painted a different picture.\n\nJose Baez, one of Javice's attorneys, said JPMorgan didn't do enough due diligence before purchasing Frank, calling it a \"business deal that went wrong.\"\n\nHe called Javice an \"incredible young woman\" who, at age 28, was savvy enough to secure a one-on-one meeting with Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's CEO.\n\nBaez added that the acquisition was more about acquiring Javice herself than Frank's users.\n\n\"They saw something in Charlie, a young female CEO breaking the glass ceiling,\" Baez said. \"That's what JPMorgan negotiated for, and that's what they got.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Amar's attorney, Jonathan Cogan, referred to his client as an \"innocent man\" who was dragged into his boss' problems after the prosecution \"lumped them together.\"\n\nAmar, who appeared stoic through much of the proceedings, nodded subtly while Cogan reminded the jury that he's innocent until proven guilty.\n\n\"Sometimes, our government gets it wrong,\" Cogan said. \"Sometimes, prosecutors can be overzealous. Sometimes, innocent people get swept up.\"\n\nOpening statements in the lower Manhattan trial came after nearly two days of jury selection.\n\nBefore being selected, jurors were questioned at hushed sidebars about their personal lives, including whether they had ever worked in finance, been a victim of fraud, or had close personal or business relationships with people such as Dimon.\n\nSome prospective jurors were excused after saying that they worked for JPMorgan or other banks. Another was excused after saying she enjoyed watching shows about scams and thinking about the psychology that motivates fraudsters.\n\n\"This is not an easy procedure. It was difficult. It took longer than I expected,\" Hellerstein said after the 12 jurors and 4 alternates were selected Thursday.\n\nThe jury and its alternates include people who told the judge they worked in sales management or IT, as well as some who worked for the city of New York. Others worked in healthcare or had no job.\n\nThroughout the voir dire process, Javice \u2014 dressed in a blouse and pencil skirt \u2014 smiled in the direction of jurors and took frequent notes. She appeared personable and chatted with the attorneys on each side of her, playing with her hair while talking.\n\nThe trial of Javice and Amar continues Friday.\n\nCorrection: February 21, 2025 \u2014 Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story misspelled the name of a defendant. Olivier Amar is on trial, not Oliver Amar.",

Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images\n\nJPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are taking steps to limit junior bankers' work hours.\n\nThe move follows scrutiny over Wall Street's culture of overworking and a recent death.\n\nOther banks, including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, haven't capped working hours.\n\nTwo Wall Street banks are cracking down on young bankers' working hours as the industry continues to grapple with a long-standing culture of overwork.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that JPMorgan Chase plans to limit bankers' hours and that Bank of America is using a new tool to track their time on the job.\n\nJPMorgan will cap working time at 80 hours a week. This is the first time the bank has taken such a measure. It carves out one big exception: live deals, typically the most taxing part of the job, when bankers need to be on call for high-stakes work around the clock.\n\nBofA, which already flagged work above that 80-hour weekly threshold to human resources, is implementing a system that requires junior bankers to share more details about how their time is spent and to which senior bankers they report. They will also be asked to note how much capacity they have for more work.\n\nMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs haven't established working-hour caps, the Journal reported.\n\nThe crackdown follows the death of a 35-year-old Bank of America banker, whose death in May renewed concerns about Wall Street's grueling working conditions. While the coroner's report did not establish a connection between his death and work, the death prompted a raft of questions across the industry about working conditions, particularly among the company's junior ranks, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in May that executives talked about what they learned from the banker's death.\n\nThe new rules come after the Journal's August investigation into BofA. The story detailed how junior bankers are routinely instructed to lie about their working hours so that they don't exceed the bank's policies. The bank asked employees to report any such instances to HR following the story.\n\nHowever, current and former employees told BI in May that the call from HR feels \"surface level\" and is a way for the bank to \"cover\" itself in the event of backlash. Known as the \"banker's diary,\" the tool is also used to pile on more work if there appear to be openings in an employee's schedule.\n\nJPMorgan and Bank of America did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM 3.32%), the largest bank in the U.S. by assets, fell 4.5%. Shares of investment banks and asset managers Goldman Sachs (GS 2.91%) and Morgan Stanley (MS 3.20%) also fell 3.9% and 4.5%, respectively.\n\nInvestors aren't ready for a recession\n\nThe stock market and the consumer have proven extraordinarily resilient over the last few years, despite high inflation and the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates over 530 basis points (5.3%) in a relatively short period. Although inflation is not at the Federal Reserve's 2% preferred target and some worry that it might revert higher, investors have largely shaken off these concerns this year.\n\nThe threat of a slowdown in the economy or a recession has not been in focus with a strong labor market and economy that seems bulletproof, but signs of a potential recession have rattled the market on a few occasions over the last few years.\n\nThat seems to be the culprit behind today's market's sell-off, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average giving up 500 points. Consumer retail giant Walmart (NYSE: WMT), often viewed as a proxy for how people feel about spending, reported earnings this morning along with timid guidance that left investors questioning whether consumer spending may be at or close to a peak. Consumer spending contributes over two-thirds of gross domestic product, so a slowdown can lead to a slowdown in the economy.",

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A Florida woman backed by wealthy advisers who created a company to make it easier for college students to apply for financial aid went on trial Thursday on criminal charges that she defrauded JPMorgan Chase & Co. in a $175 million buyout deal.\n\nFrank founder Charlie Javice committed a \u201cmassive fraud\u201d by telling lies to claim her company had millions of customers when it only had about 400,000 clients as she closed in on a deal in the summer of 2021, Assistant U.S. Attorney Rushmi Bhaskaran told jurors in an opening statement at the trial of Javice and another former Frank executive.\n\nJavice\u2019s attorney, Jose Baez, blamed the criminal probe that resulted in charges against his client on the nation\u2019s largest bank, saying it experienced \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d after the federal government altered regulations so that the purchase no longer was sensible. The only way to cancel the buyout was to claim fraud, he said.\n\nJavice, 31, a Miami Beach, Florida, resident, was arrested in April 2023 on conspiracy, wire and bank fraud charges.\n\nProsecutors have said that Javice, who appeared on the Forbes 2019 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list, would have earned $45 million from the fraud.\n\nBhaskaran said the nation\u2019s largest bank requested proof shortly before the purchase closed that there really were over four million customers.\n\n\u201cThey were this close to a deal that would make them millionaires. There was only one thing that stood in their way: the truth,\u201d she said.\n\nJavice reached out to a friend from her college days to buy \u201coff-the-shelf data on four million people\u201d and the deal closed, the prosecutor said.\n\n\u201cEventually, this house of cards, built on the defendants\u2019 lies, came crashing down,\u201d Bhaskaran said.\n\nBaez, though, said his client acted honestly and honorably in negotiations with JPMorgan and was hired as part of the buyout deal to a three-year contract that included millions of dollars in bonuses with plans for her to become JPMorgan\u2019s \u201cface of students\u201d to connect the bank with a coveted market of young new banking customers.\n\nHe said the deal with JPMorgan was finalized over 22 business days as the bank hurried to capture the startup company with links to the lucrative market of young clients before other banks could beat them to it.\n\n\u201cThey took a gamble and lost, and now they want to destroy a life for it,\u201d Baez said.\n\nAs Baez repeatedly attacked the bank in his opening statement, prosecutors successfully objected several times. Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein reminded jurors that the case was not about the bank but rather was about whether Javice told lies to secure a buyout.\n\nA JPMorgan spokesperson declined comment.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nJPMorgan Chase published the first installment of a climate-focused advisory series last week that the bank says is designed to help clients understand climate risk and how to factor its financial impacts in asset prices.\n\nThe first edition of \u201cClimate Intuition\u201d series looks to lay the foundation for why climate-related risk is an \u201cincreasingly relevant consideration for capital providers, capital seekers, and policy makers,\u201d JPMorgan Chief Risk Officer Ashley Bacon and Global Head of Corporate Advisory Rama Variankaval wrote in the foreword.\n\nThe report and its future iterations are spearheaded by Sarah Kapnick, the bank\u2019s global head of climate advisory and former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . JPMorgan appointed Kapnick to lead the division last October.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Feb. 13 report identified and expanded on several key emerging trends in what Kapnick labels a \u201cnew climate era.\u201d She said the era is marked by factors including an increase in annual global temperatures and greenhouse gas emissions, and the volatility of insurance markets due to climate-driven natural disasters.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a challenge for the economy,\u201d Kapnick wrote in an introductory note that pointed to how the onset of several emissions disclosure regulations could increase corporate compliance costs and shifts in consumers\u2019 preference for sustainable products could impact market shares.\n\nAdaptation struggles aside, climate change also poses a physical threat, according to Kapnick\u2019s report. She said that extreme weather-driven catastrophes can harm infrastructure, spurring expensive repairs, insurance claims and even affecting production of products and supply chains. However, Kapnick noted that these looming challenges could also pave the way for future innovation in climate technology and drive informed decision-making.\n\n\u201cSuccess in the New Climate Era hinges on our ability to integrate climate considerations into daily decision-making,\u201d Kapnick wrote. \u201cThose who adapt will lead, while others risk falling behind.\u201d\n\nKapnick\u2019s prior financial and scientific background puts her in a unique position to lead JPMorgan\u2019s climate advisory series. Prior to her two-year stint at NOAA, Kapnick worked at JPMorgan at the managing director level as a senior climate scientist and sustainability strategist in the bank\u2019s wealth management division in 2021 and 2022, according to her LinkedIn profile. Her resume also includes working at NOAA as a research and hydroclimate scientist focused on the predictability and variability of snow and extreme storms. Kapnick\u2019s first foray into finance came when she joined Goldman Sachs as an investment banking analyst in 2004 before her environmental research stints.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s rapidly evolving world, understanding climate risk is important for staying ahead in the financial landscape,\u201d Bacon and Variankaval wrote in the foreword. \u201cSarah\u2019s expertise on issues related to climate, energy transition, nature and biodiversity will help us better inform our clients and enhance our firm\u2019s climate thought leadership.\u201d\n\nThe report said that climate change will \u201cincreasingly manifest\u201d with each additional ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere in the form of extreme weather conditions, biodiversity loss, nature degradation and incurred economic and societal costs.\n\nDespite increased investments and innovation in climate technology over the past decade, corporations making headwinds establishing net-zero and decarbonization plans and the introduction of several national and international sustainability-focused legislations, Kapnick wrote that much of this progress has also been reversed due to recent political and economic changes.\n\nShe attributed the withdrawal to \u201cchanges in leadership, economic conditions, and technological feasibility stagnation.\u201d As current U.S. policies stand, global warming is expected to reach up to 2.7 degrees Celsius \u2014 surpassing the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of maintaining this rise below 2 degrees Celsius, she said.\n\nThe first edition of the \u201cClimate Intuition\u201d series comes nearly a month after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump began his first day in office by signing a flurry of executive orders that signaled reversal on the nation\u2019s federal climate policy. Among them included orders to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, again; declare a national \u201cenergy emergency;\u201d pause all wind power development; and suspend all funding disbursements related to the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nThe report concluded that in order to curb emissions for a 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise scenario in alignment with the Paris Agreement by 2100 \u2014 a bar the world is on a pathway to surpass soon \u2014 corporations need to focus on emissions reductions and ramping up investments in carbon removal. If such solutions are not adopted, Kapnick said corporations may need to \u201cplan for the physical manifestations of climate change and social responses that will ensue\u201d in the long term.",

Its health and wellness center will feature an array of fitness services including yoga and cycling rooms, physical therapy and other medical services, modern mother\u2019s rooms for parents who are breastfeeding, and prayer and meditation spaces.\n\n\n\nReturn-to-the-office work is taking on a whole new meaning as companies reconstruct offices with plentiful amenities for their employees.\n\nWall Street titan JPMorgan Chase is a prime example, opening a $3 billion headquarters with perks including lunch being delivered deskside and a sprawling health and wellness center.\n\nWhen it opens, 270 Park Ave. \u2013 New York City\u2019s largest all-electric tower \u2013 will become the new home for 14,000 employees. Designed by architect Norman Foster, the building will \"define the modern workplace with 21st century infrastructure\" by boasting smart technology and 2.5 million square feet of flexible and collaborative space, according to JPMorgan.\n\nThe building's biophilic design, an architectural style that increases connectivity to nature, will feature extensive use of natural plants. The building will also provide 30% more daylight than a typical developer-led, speculative office building and incorporate circadian lighting to reduce the impact of electric light and promote a healthier indoor environment.\n\nWhen the plan behind the new global headquarters was unveiled in 2022, the company said it was partnering with experts including Joseph Allen, director of Harvard University\u2019s healthy buildings program, and wellness expert Deepak Chopra. It also parented with Union Square Hospitality Group\u2019s Danny Meyer, who has been advising JPMorgan on a \"wellness and hospitality experience\" for employees, which includes a food hall featuring diverse food operators and healthy menus.\n\nDavid Arena, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s head of global real estate, told Fortune that Meyer is helping JPMorgan, the largest US bank with about $4 trillion in assets, create an environment like \"Eataly or something even better.\"\n\nThere are 19 different restaurants, some of which include table service. Employees can also have food delivered directly to their desk, according to Arena.\n\nIts health and wellness center will feature an array of fitness services including yoga and cycling rooms, physical therapy and other medical services, modern mother\u2019s rooms for parents who are breastfeeding, and prayer and meditation spaces.\n\nNorman also doubled the amount of outside and fresh air spaces in the building. Its advanced HVAC filtration systems will also continually clean outdoor air as it comes into the building, while also cleaning recirculated air.\n\nThere will be 50% more communal spaces and 25% more volume of space per person, offering more flexible choices for workers, according to JPMorgan. At the top of the 60-story tower there will be a conference center with unobstructed city views where the company will host events for clients and employees.\n\n\"It's become more and more apparent to everybody that place, the physical place, is really important for folks, for their energy, for the way they feel about themselves and the way they feel about their companies,\" Arena said in an interview with Fortune earlier this month.\n\nAs COVID-related restrictions eased and return-to-office mandates took effect, companies began introducing fun perks and revamping office spaces to motivate employees to return to the work environment.\n\nJPMorgan employees were notified last month that all workers must be in office five days a week starting in March, although 60% of its workforce are already doing so.\n\nWalmart, which is currently in the process of bringing most of its workers back to its main hubs, recently opened a new campus for its Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters.\n\nThe campus, spanning approximately 350 acres, features 12 office buildings, biking and walking trails, and amenities such as a childcare center and a 360,000-square-foot wellness center.\n\nLast year, Amazon opened two new offices at its Puget Sound Headquarters in Bellevue, Washington. One of them, named Dynamo, provides more than 300,000 square feet of new office space, while the other, Sonic, offers 19 floors of working space across more than 400,000 square feet.\n\nIn September 2023, Amazon opened the doors to its newest office in the iconic Lord & Taylor department store building after a years-long renovation. The midtown Manhattan office includes a cafe, courtyard and outdoor terrace complete with a dog run and views of the Empire State Building for more than 2,000 employees.\n\nGET UPDATES ON THIS STORY AT FOXBUSINESS.COM",

For example, early last year, BYD cut the prices of its major models through the Glory Edition model updates.\n\nThis year is a slightly different story, as BYD didn't cut prices at the start of the year, even though Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) fired the first shot at restarting a price war by offering an insurance subsidy for the Model 3 on February 5, the first working day of the Year of the Snake on the Chinese lunar calendar.\n\nUnlike early last year, BYD held a vehicle intelligence strategy launch event on February 10 and brought Smart Driving edition updates to 21 models, but left prices unchanged.\n\nLai's team sees BYD's move as another form of price marketing or price war.\n\n\"In fact, at the beginning of every year since 2020 or 2021, we have seen two major price leaders -- Tesla and BYD -- launch similar price marketing in January, \" the team wrote.\n\nThis year, that price war only erupted in February, largely due to the fact that, thanks to the trade-in incentives, most OEMs had very low inventories in January and had already secured sizable orders in December 2024, the team said.\n\nFollow us by email: Get Newsletter",

            "content": "NEW YORK , Feb. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- J.P. Morgan Asset Management has announced plans to convert the JPMorgan Unconstrained Debt Fund, pending board approval in May 2025. The converted ETF would be renamed JPMorgan Flexible Debt ETF. The ETF will be managed in a substantially similar manner to the mutual fund after conversion, which is anticipated to take place during the third quarter of 2025, pending board approval.\n\n\"Given continued market volatility and uncertainty, clients are increasingly interested in accessing the flexible approach of this strategy, which allows it to shift portfolio allocation in changing market conditions,\" said Bob Michele, Portfolio Manager for the fund and Head of Global Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities for J.P.

            "content": "Notes from the desk: Welcome to this month\u2019s Quarterly Review, a series where I dive into what executives from some of the best brands in financial services are focusing on in this quarter, as well as how they are planning to achieve their goals. It\u2019s a chance for the industry to learn about what goes on behind an FI\u2019s four walls and how leadership manages their priorities.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all: a review implies no mandates, a check in. So stay tuned next quarter to learn whether the executive achieves her plans and translates theory into reality.\n\nIn this edition we will\n\nfocus on Miki Van Cleave,\n\nChief Design Officer\n\nat Chase.\n\nThe bigger an organization, the harder it is to ensure that customer and employee experiences speak the same language. One of Chase\u2019s Chief Design Officer Miki Van Cleave\u2019s key objectives is to ensure there is harmony between the firm\u2019s customer and employee experiences.\n\nVan Cleave assumed the role seven months ago after spending five years as Head of Design for the firm\u2019s CI&A (Customer Identity & Authentication) and Consumer Banking, where she built multiple design teams and worked on creating interconnected experiences.\n\n\n\nBefore Chase, Miki held several leadership roles at USAA Federal Savings Bank. She ran the bank\u2019s innovation team and designed its auto experience product.\n\nToday she is here to share how she is strategizing for growth in her new role by breaking silos, digging into Chase\u2019s backend processes, and building more confidence in product delivery and design processes of the firm.\n\nThe focus: Growth, codifying discovery processes, and improving employee experiences\n\nI stepped into the role of Chief Design Officer in August 2024, and since then my goal has been to learn as much as I can and hit the ground running, picking up where my predecessor left off. The team achieved so much in 2024, and my goal is to keep up the team\u2019s awesome momentum in delivering great experiences and products to our customers in Q1 2025 and beyond. Some of the key achievements in 2024 include increasing our investment in our teams in India, which has been a multi-year focus, and gaining clarity on our body of work (BOW) and improved team allocations to enable us to work more efficiently.\n\nSomething I am really proud of is that we started a Challenge Coin recognition program in Design & Customer Experience. Inspired by military coins, I hand out Challenge Coins in person to those employees who have been nominated as showing up and willing to help.\n\n1. Enhancing employee experiences: Customer-centric design continues to be at the forefront of our design strategy and we\u2019re constantly working on new ways to enhance experiences for our customers and employees. Employees in our branches and answering our customers\u2019 calls are the lifeblood of Chase, and it\u2019s crucial we equip them with the right tools and resources to do their jobs. The team is so good at their craft, they know the space and know how to deliver great products. The next level of maturity for us will be to raise our business acumen and continue elevating our presence and profile within the design, product, tech, and data teams and business partners.\n\n2. Building up: We\u2019re currently focused on continuing our overall growth, building on what we accomplished in 2024. This includes ongoing conversations to align on a detailed BOW (Body of Work) and broader awareness across the organization\u2019s leadership on driving efficiencies as we grow and evolve the team.\n\n3. Discovery processes: I also want to codify our approach to discovery, which will help to raise our confidence on new product delivery and get alignment with our partners on the ROI of design. We\u2019ve seen success in formalizing other processes and problem-solving approaches, like our \u201cCustomer Why Template,\u201d and know there is value in continuing to standardize processes for better collaboration.\n\nPlan of action\n\nIt\u2019s important for us to stay focused on our objectives, while continuing to cultivate new ideas.\n\nThe key is to avoid being distracted in a fast-moving environment and stay the course.\n\n1. Working beyond silos: It\u2019s critical that we look beyond our own team to solve problems and come up with new ideas. We want to avoid silos and collaborate with other teams to help us understand and better solve a customer issue. A design challenge isn\u2019t always going to be solved by the design team alone; sometimes we need to enlist the support and ideas of people from product, data and other teams from our Product and Experience and Technology (PXT) organization, as well as customer-facing businesses from Chase\u2019s consumer bank, to help us find the right solution.\n\n\n\n2. Understanding the whole experience: Beyond designing new features that help solve a customer pain point, we also want to ensure we\u2019re providing the best overall multichannel experience. This means looking at the customer experience holistically \u2014 not just at visible experiences like the mobile app, web or branch \u2014 to ensure there are no gaps. We employ Service Design Blueprints to understand how less-visible factors, like how back-end systems, call center policies and scripts, and more may be impacting the customer experience.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve seen success in formalizing other processes and problem-solving approaches, like our \u201cCustomer Why Template,\u201d which was an early tool in our discovery processes. We are now creating a more standardized practice for discovery which will help create consistency across the organization. Some of the key objectives are:\n\nCreate a common understanding around what discovery means Establish timelines for how long discovery should take to complete Increase confidence in a design/product solution on the path to execution Mitigate risk\n\nLast month we covered",

From a corporate-citizenship perspective, it worsens traffic and pollution while disproportionately pushing out women, caregivers, senior employees, and individuals with disabilities. Many of these are top performers, and many of them only able to join the workforce under hybrid work rules. This directly contradicts JPMC\u2019s commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nRemote work may not suit in-person services, but it\u2019s the way of the future for all knowledge work. Indeed, it\u2019s often the only way to get anything done, even from the office!\u201d\n\nJPMorgan informed employees on January 10th that they would need to appear in person at the office five days a week after years of using a hybrid model stemming from the complexities of Covid-19.\n\nIn leaked audio obtained by The Hill, Dimon slammed remote working, even only on Fridays.\n\n\u201cIt simply doesn\u2019t work\u2026 And it doesn\u2019t work for creativity. It slows down decision-making\u2026\n\nAnd don\u2019t give me the s*** that \u2018work from home Friday\u2019 works. I call a lot of people on Friday. There\u2019s not a goddamn person to get a hold of\u2026\n\nYou don\u2019t have to work at JP Morgan. So, the people of you who don\u2019t want to work at the company, that\u2019s fine with me\u2026 I\u2019m not mad at you. Don\u2019t be mad at me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a free country.

            "content": "The J.P. Morgan Circle: The Advisory Agenda\n\n[Music]\n\nANU: Welcome to the J. P. Morgan Circle. I'm Anu Iyengar, the Global Head of Advisory and M& A, and I'm delighted to be joined by my colleagues on the Global Advisory Leadership Team. And we're going to talk a little bit about our perspectives, expectations, and outlook for 2025. The animal spirits seem to be back and there is an extreme level of optimism in the market.\n\nANU: The sentiment seems to have changed such that people are expecting rainbows and sunshine, but it feels like with the elections behind us, the world seems to have chosen change.\n\nRAMA: I mean, look, the world has definitely chosen change. [00:01:00] We had something like a hundred elections, federal elections. About half the global population went to the ballot in the last 12 months.\n\nRAMA: And about 80 percent of incumbents lost some ground in these elections. So change was definitely what voters voted for. Also agree with the animal spirits point. We have had two years now in the U. S. equity markets of 20 percent plus returns, and that's quite unprecedented. Additionally, when we have a trifecta government in the U.S., which is The White House and the Senate and the House all controlled by the same party. The first year of such a trifecta government usually sees an 80 percent outperformance in the equity markets relative to the average.\n\nANU: Yet, all the elections are not quite done, right? I mean, there's still not just election uncertainty, but also uncertainty around geopolitical risk.\n\nDWAYNE: I think you're right, Anu. We've got the Russian Ukraine situation, which is unresolved, and we have numerous presidential elections across Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and a number of those in the kind of Central Eastern Europe. That plays to confidence, and confidence, as we know in our business, is the main driver.\n\nANU: 2024 ended up being a much better year than most people forecast. We ended the year with 3. 5 trillion in global volumes and a 12 percent year over year growth. And it feels like 2025 building on that should be at least 12 percent of growth, if not even higher. Does every part of the world feel as optimistic?\n\nROHIT: From an Asian standpoint, Japan definitely, you know, feels that way. Now, the outbound appetite from Japan continues to be very strong. Replacement of expiring patents and searching for new growth pillars, particularly in the industrial tech sector. The growth of activism in Japan, the change in mindset and receptivity now to combining domestically, being taken private.\n\nROHIT: We will also see with the support of the regulatory environment there. Significant inbounds, particularly if, for instance, you see a very strong U. S. dollar. Many of these Japanese companies have very strong business models and foreign exchange earnings. The favorable exchange ratio might actually mean that Japan continues to be a very active recipient of inbound strategic interest as well.\n\nRAFAEL: Yeah, and Latin America, as you know, has always been an area where there's some uncertainty. And we're not going to be absent of that next year, but we are ending the year with a lot of optimism, a lot of it driven by the cross border activity that we see, which in Latin America happens to be 60 to 70 percent of the wallet.\n\nRAFAEL: And the interesting thing is that it's no longer only the North America and EMEA corridors that are impacting that volume, but we're seeing a lot more activity from the likes of China, the Middle East, also playing a role. And most importantly. The emergence of Latin American champions that are taking advantage of these opportunities to grow within borders and across within Latin America.\n\nRAMA: You said that global M& A volumes were 3. 5 trillion dollars last year, expected to be perhaps, you know, materially higher. We looked at the level of GDP growth, the level of equity multiples, level of interest rates, and forecasted using a statistical model, the likely M& A volumes, and that range has been up to 20 percent higher.\n\nRAMA: That's just based on these kind of fundamental factors, and then Rohit you touched on the regulatory environment. Massive expectations. We'll see how far we end up going of deregulation in the U. S. under the new government. That should be a new and pretty material tailwind to the M& A volume as well.\n\nREBECCA: Given the regulatory market that we've been in the last couple of years, not surprisingly, we've seen a lot of boards reaching out to us for regulatory talent or talent who could help maybe unlock or open their eyes to different pathways and how to make this work and come together more efficiently.\n\nANU: Yeah, this expectation on a more favorable regulatory environment is actually quite broad. It's also how much money companies are going to be spending in being regulatory compliant. In addition to that, I think companies will probably continue doing self help. We saw a spate of that happen in terms of corporate clarity transactions across the globe.\n\nANU: And when you combine that with the valuation differential between the U.S. and the rest of the world, we are certainly expecting that the focus on corporate clarity and the focus on U. S. markets will likely continue.\n\nALFREDO: Yeah, that is likely to happen. There is an increased amount of that activity that we're seeing in terms of corporate clarity, and there's no reason why it would end.\n\nALFREDO: I think that, coupled with the M& A outlook that you are outlining, should spark quite a bit of, of activity more broadly. And it's both. Organic on the part of companies and then induced by external factors.\n\nRAMA: We talk about two things and they seem sometimes contradictory. One is the importance of scale. And yet we say corporate clarity matters.\n\nRAMA: These are both true statements. Being a scaled player in your core competency is definitely something the market rewards. But having a disparate set of businesses where you may not be the lead player, I don't think the market likes.\n\nDWAYNE: Corporates to get the clarity point. We see them seeking scale, but more focused scale and really trying to get ahead of Activist debates or otherwise also to enhance the value equation\n\nALFREDO: Activists continue to be very focused on value themes, but also on governance and certainly boards tend to be the areas Where they have most focus.\n\nALFREDO: Rebecca, how do you think about that and how do you advise boards of clients in terms of their refreshment?\n\nREBECCA: Yeah, I think the best boards are always going to be in succession planning mode and so the best outcome is that they don't have an activist come knocking and have to defend their board, their composition, their You know, kind of investment thesis.\n\nREBECCA: Um, but where you and I partner best, I think is where the doorbell has rung and there is something we need to solve for. We're often looking for operators. We're often looking for CEOs or C suite [00:07:00] executives who bring some sort of halo effect that can help not just answer the investment thesis, but also bring some value creation.\n\nDWAYNE: That is a key component now of the broader advisory business in a mere one. We hope to continue to develop and develop very strongly and as well as the it. Connectivity between our clients.\n\nREBECCA: Governance matters more today than it ever has. Stakeholders care, shareholders care, institutions care. But no matter if you're an early stage company, you're a late stage company, you've been public for a hundred years.\n\nREBECCA: You're a family, you're a founder, your private equity, your venture, you're thinking about your governance really differently than you were 10 years ago.\n\nANU: The relationship between the company and the shareholders have also changed because there was a time when people would come and ask us for a vaccination to prevent the activist from coming in, whereas we've changed our practice to shareholder engagement, because as long as you have complete meeting of the minds between your strategy and what your shareholders want, then an activist may still be there.\n\nANU: But at least you have your shareholders as your stakeholders. First line of defense,\n\nRAMA: It can ask question. You said India, right? India is in fact one of the markets that has the best valuations You know next to the US India might be the best, right? The fact that there is still interest in India is that because the growth expectations are commensurately very high as well.\n\nROHIT: Yeah. There seems to be now growing consensus that the midterm growth outlook in India purely driven by the domestic demand It's going to be very strong.\n\nROHIT: That's also driving the thought process around carve out IPOs of domestic business of multinational subsidiaries in India. The other thing that's driving valuation there is the growing pool of domestic savings that are moving into the equity capital markets. That are compensating for any volatility in the international investor demand for stocks in India\n\nRAFAEL: As interesting because you point out this issue of valuation and relative valuation across different geographies, and you could say now with exceptionalism in the U.S. And high value multiples. Would that be a deterrent for inbound M and A into the U. S. But what I'm seeing in Latin America is actually in the country because for our clients who are seeing the U. S. as a long term investment on a risk adjusted basis, attractive still, not for the valuations that I have right now, but for what they could provide in the long term.\n\nANU: That's the most attractive thing about the U. S. market is the growth that it is offering. So from across the world, when you look at valuations, yes, valuations are high, but you either play that by taking your U. S. business and getting that valuation for the U. S. business, or you're saying, I'm buying into that market because it gives me access to a much deeper capital market, much deeper set of consumers who have been resilient.\n\nRAMA: The other thing to your point, you know, there is the highest expectation of growth in the U. S. Yeah. In the developed market, but also the U. S. 's highest track record or the best track record of rewarding growth.\n\nROHIT: And it's true for how the Japanese think about the U. S. markets. Think about the addressable demand pool here and the growth.\n\nROHIT: And when you think about it in the context of now a stagnant GDP and a demographic profile that's going the wrong way in Japan, you kind of want to be and need to be in this market if you want to deliver long term growth.\n\nANU: Yeah, but even though we talk about U. S. High valuations, if you take away the mega seven companies, there still seems to be.\n\nANU: And even though we said the minimum bar for entering the S and P 500 was 18 billion, I think there's 100 companies in the S and P 500, which are not 18 billion in market cap. The activists certainly seem to continue to find those mispriced opportunities in the market.\n\nALFREDO: You're spot on there. The high valuations do not prevent people from identifying companies are underperforming or viewed as underperforming.\n\nALFREDO: But I do think there is a sense by the activists that opportunities do remain. And I think as we think about the markets that will also have a role to play with respect to the appetite on the part of private equity players coming in. When there is a dislocation of value, there are instances where a company is better valued in the private markets and can He operated better in the private markets than in the public ones.\n\nREBECCA: And we've been seeing a huge uptick in private equity, engaging to professionalize their boards earlier. They want to make sure that they have the very best talent that they can have, make sure they're bringing independence, have that operating profile that can help that CEO and management team really be the best in class that they can be.\n\nRAMA: If you look at the private equity data in the last year or two, they're tracking at about a quarter of the rate of monetization that they've historically had. And then you go back to what we started the conversation with, this in spite equity valuations being so strong.\n\nANU: In 20 and 21, most of it was domestic and cross border has been a little bit muted for a few years.\n\nANU: Where do we see activity? Where was it? Where is it going?\n\nDWAYNE: I start in the UK.\n\nANU: All right.\n\nDWAYNE: Okay.\n\nANU: That's certainly been the most active part of the locket.\n\nDWAYNE: We had a bad 2023. I'm gonna be honest. And 2024 came back very strong.\n\nANU: I expected 23 actually to be better. To be better. Right. I remember we were kind of positioned for Brexit, then something changed.\n\nDWAYNE: So I think, generally speaking, there was a concern around how the UK was emerging out of COVID, the Brexit effect. Valuations were at a low point. We kept talking about the opportunity in the UK in particular, on the relative valuation trade. And I think as a result, people saw that. And people also just kind of decided now is the time to move.\n\nDWAYNE: So we've seen a 43 percent increase. We're back to kind of normal trends.\n\nROHIT: What's driving that? Is it that the buyers are looking for the UK domestic market? Is it they're focused on companies with global earnings, but sitting in an undervalued jurisdiction?\n\nDWAYNE: I think the people mix up slightly as they say UK company, but actually when you look at the earnings, they're not coming from the UK.\n\nDWAYNE: The actual exposure is quite relatively low. They are that kind of truly broad global businesses. I think\n\nROHIT: that exact dynamic. It's true for a lot of companies in Japan and for a lot of companies in Australia. The same open shareholder registers, strong corporates with global earnings, but traded in a market where foreign exchange movement can actually make them look, on a relative basis, very attractively valued.\n\nDWAYNE: I think it's almost been people have over indexed on kind of very localized issues. Rather than recognizing here are low valuation global companies that actually when you look at a lot of the tech, et cetera, and it's one of my points that I think actually we underdo the commercialization of a lot of UK tech and actually a lot of U.S. companies pick up that tech and commercialize it much better.\n\nRAFAEL: Yeah. And the activity in the UK is mainly within Europe or you're seeing? cross border with Asia or North America?\n\nDWAYNE: We're seeing it with cross border with, uh, with all, actually. It's probably one of the most open markets in terms of allowing foreign companies take out U.K. businesses. Now, equally, we also see it in reverse. And quite a bit of cross border out of the U. K. has been happening over the years. And, you know, Rama, it's part of the valuation trade. They're looking to balance boards. They're seeking to pull more U. S. orientated people on to be acceptable to the U. S. investor base.\n\nALFREDO: And I do think with the internationalization of shareholder bases across the world, there is going to be more of a push from the owners of companies for more of international expertise and different skills that don't need to be necessarily local.\n\nREBECCA: The other things that we continue to see a lot more interest in People from different parts of the world, whether they're listing in the UK or they're listing in the US, they want people who are global citizens at sort of table stakes and understand what it takes to operate successfully in those different markets.\n\nREBECCA: And these sort of single issue directors really aren't in favor as much as, you know, the best athlete who can tick a number of different box in the composition table.\n\nALFREDO: And Rohit, when you think about Asia, so Japan is a clear proven case, we've seen the growth, the number of dollars going into that market, the activity levels, the changes to the regulatory framework that makes it easier.\n\nALFREDO: What other areas do you think are going to be particularly in focus?\n\nROHIT: I'd say India is a market where there's a lot of strategic and financial sponsor interest, and that means that India, for the addressable domestic market, It's a very attractive opportunity.\n\nANU: I feel like everybody is so optimistic about valuations and growth in that market.\n\nANU: But at least in the last 12, 18 months, that has sort of been true. Valuations in the Indian market. Maybe the only place which is even higher than U. S.\n\nROHIT: That is true.\n\nANU: why are the activists suddenly interested in Japan? Because it's the same activists. It's one of the most successful U. S. Exports to Japan. Why is Japan in fashion?\n\nALFREDO: So it's an interesting question. There's always gonna be opportunities in the U. S. But I do think one of the phenomena in the globalized market is that you're always trying to streamline your investment thesis. And so you've identified a company That you have done a good investment in in the U.S. Then you start looking at Canada. Then you move into Europe and then you decide whether there's something in the APAC region that applies and has a similar logic. And so you have a tremendous amount of capital going. into chasing growth. Some of it will remain in the U. S. But some of it will have to go elsewhere.\n\nALFREDO: And we think that the Japanese, Korean, and Australian markets tend to be places where there are those opportunities, both because of scale and growth profile that activists could be interested in.\n\nRAFAEL: That's why, to me, it's very exciting to have these kind of discussions, because activism is a word that has not appeared in the board in Latin America for a long time because of the few companies that are truly public, concentration, and so on. But to your point, Eventually, activists are going to start looking at other regions and other areas where they're going to apply that expertise.\n\nROHIT: It is the same pattern recognition everywhere. Undervalued companies, cross ownerships, value unlocking, regulatory support for activism and deal flow. Lazy balance sheets.\n\nRAMA: Lazy balance sheets,\n\nROHIT: capital efficiencies. And particularly in Japan, it is also the very low cost of domestic debt, which enables these activists to then drive these companies. Into possible transactions.\n\nANU: You know, the industry dynamic in Japan is, of course, always been both curious and interesting and a big driver.\n\nANU: But part of what private equity has been waiting for is going back to that industry environment where Money was almost free\n\nRAMA: the period of zero interest rate is definitely not coming back I think we can say that with a high degree of certainty But having an idea of where interest rates might settle may be good enough Maybe not at zero, but if the 10 year is going to settle between four and four and a half percent Which is where it's been which\n\nANU: is not bad at all\n\nRAMA: Just not bad from a very long term historical perspective and that clarity might actually be enough for investors to go out and borrow the money and make the investment rather than wait for zero interest rates again.\n\nRAMA: Is it also that, you know, look, the world is moving pretty fast, you know, the emergence of topics like ESG or AI, the board having expertise in these emerging topics, or is that really not a focus area?\n\nALFREDO: I think activists do care that the business is equipped with the right people to kind of be a counterbalance to the management team, someone who can be a sounding board, who can be kind of a differentiated opinion, and who can probe where the direction of the company is going.\n\nALFREDO: So clearly, in sectors that are highly specialized, like AI, and other kind of industry spaces or regulatory spaces. It's important to know that in many countries across the globe, including in the U. S., there is a bit of a generational change at the board level.\n\nREBECCA: Yeah, the best boards are always going to be in succession planning. There is this age cliff that we've been looking at for the last couple of years. So I think the best advice is to be out there looking at talent, but with the pace of change, with the pace of business, with A. I., making sure that you're not just exchanging one skill set for the next, but you're thinking five years ahead.\n\nALFREDO: And I do think there's a globalization of markets as a result of that, a globalization of companies. There's a globalization of issues that boards and managements have to deal with. And by so doing, there's also a globalization of boards.\n\nRAFAEL: And to your point, this day and age, the talent at the board is not only sitting in the U. S. for North American companies or in Asia for Asian companies or Europe, it's everywhere.\n\nALFREDO: But I also push it further, which is. The place where growth might be might change very radically over five or six years. So it is important to one, have people who understand the core business, but also people who have the toolkit to be able to be deployed into a new geography, a new market, a new reality, and to quickly know what questions to ask, to be able to get that information that allows them to decide.\n\nANU: For a few years, we saw tech and healthcare being 50 percent of the M& A market. And then whether it was the regulatory focus on tech or Focus on covert from health care and then G. L. P. One this year. Actually, D. I. Had one of the biggest growth and particularly D. I. Europe saw a lot of activity. What do you see as the biggest sectors in each of the regions that is driving activity?\n\nDWAYNE: Many do in in a mere for a number of reasons. I think there is the clarity play. There is a need for scale, and as a general theme, it has to continue. And we are seeing it in certain of the industrial plays, and I think the other key areas from EPRM, or is what we call EPRM in terms of the energy power, renewables, etc.\n\nDWAYNE: We're 37 plus countries, so there's individual strategies. How do you overlay across them? So that naturally is going to be another main player. And I think FIG. Whether it's the evolution of the private equity firms, the big players, the KKRs, the Blackstones, etc. Um, it's the bank consolidation. Hopefully regulation relaxes itself.\n\nDWAYNE: It allows inter country consolidation, because a lot of it is still needed. But then again, you can't get away from what happens in tech. Because, and that, to me, is just one of those imponderables as to where does it strike. And tech also goes across every sector, right? It's embedded in all of them. And it's a little bit like AI, data centers, energy transition.\n\nANU: There is no avoiding that. Interplay. And that interplay, and likewise, and the tech stripe across every sector. Those, those two trends will likely continue seeing across the board. And industrial tech as...\n\nROHIT: well. All elements of industrial tech. Clearly the center of gravity of competencies between China, Korean, and Japanese businesses in diversified industrials, that center of gravity will move around.\n\nRAFAEL: It almost is a mirror to what is happening in Latin America, perhaps for, for different reasons. But the ones we see the most activity continue to be the diversified industries, like heavy manufacturing, oil and gas, energy. Perhaps because Latin America has the resources, but also we can call it nearshoring, frenshoring, reshoring.\n\nRAFAEL: But at the end of the day, it's going to be important for the U. S. and manufacturing the U. S. to have capacity nearby. with a friendly country. And Mexico right now has surpassed China already in terms of the biggest exporter to the U. S. And that will continue. So with the right investment on the right political dynamics, we see that as a very positive going in 2025.\n\nANU: Another sector which is now actually become a sector is infrastructure. We've had a team doing infrastructure financing and advisory before infrastructure became cool. Even companies which you may traditionally have not thought of as infrastructure being viewed as infrastructure. The definition of infrastructure keeps expanding and so more and more things are now called infrastructure.\n\nRAMA: So that always helps. But you're right. Look, I think, you know, whether it is the aging, you know, airports and bridges and toll roads around the globe, that's the reason why we need more financing to update the infrastructure. Then you have digital infrastructure, right? Whether it's fibers or data center or cell towers, that is obviously a more recent phenomenon, a lot of money going into that.\n\nRAMA: And then energy transition, whether it's gas, LNG, whether it's hydrogen, whether it's green or otherwise, whether it's carbon capture. That's, again, a massive secular tailwind to invest. And then the infrastructure funds have come to kind of provide the capital. And you're right, I mean, we have a team in the infrastructure finance and advisory business within the corporate advisory practice that we keep expanding and we still feel like we don't have enough people or enough resources to deploy. It's a massive area for us.\n\nROHIT: For the last 10 years, the amount of capital that's moved into renewable energy in Japan and India and across the rest of Southeast Asia, Australia, that is now at the point where it needs to seek monetization of the first round of investments, the investments that are going into digital infrastructure, particularly data centers and the valuations that we've seen explode their monetization of embedded infrastructure out of operating companies like mining companies.\n\nROHIT: We're starting to see logistics, logistics, And also industrial infrastructure, gas pipe, gas supplies, industrial gases, etc.\n\nALFREDO: What is the role of governments there? Can governments play a supplemental role? In certain instances, or not so much these days? I think the idea of private public partnership is talked about all the time in infrastructure land, especially when it comes to, you know, energy transition.\n\nRAMA: Absolutely, because a lot of these newer technologies, they are not quite, you know, commercially viable yet. So you need some level of concessionary capital, often in the form of public money, whether it's tax credits in the U. S. or, you know, direct investments in Europe and China, et cetera. You need that.\n\nRAMA: So I would say governments have a massive role to play.\n\nDWAYNE: I think it's become a, it's more and more specialized, particularly the advice clients need. Yeah. It's a different focus. It's got its own various levels of sophistication, whether it might be how do you monetize or how do you sell the actual physical assets underneath a fiber business or into a particular plant.\n\nDWAYNE: And that's got various different forms in terms of the private equity element, which might be a minority investment to the actual full sale or otherwise.\n\nRAMA: Absolutely. And the structuring of capital in many situations becomes very important, right? Because you have a lot of infrastructure assets that are embedded in otherwise in operating companies that are not infrastructure companies.\n\nRAMA: How do you finance those infrastructure assets to, to finance them at the corporate level may not be the most efficient, right? And how do you kind of, again, bring the right investors and the capital providers? To the capital seekers is something obviously we do all day long.\n\nANU: As you've hopefully heard from the conversation, there is a high level of optimism across every part of the world, across every product.\n\nANU: But at the same time, hopefully you also got a sense that it's not a straight line between wanting to do something and getting it accomplished. The environment is complex, requires a very nuanced approach. Which sector it is in is also not clear, because the lines are getting blurred. And that's why we've brought a differentiated approach to help you navigate these situations.\n\nANU: And we look forward to continuing our conversations, maybe in smaller settings. With each and every one of you and help you navigate these complex markets successfully in 2025 and beyond.\n\n[End]",

            "content": "Return-to-the-office work is taking on a whole new meaning as companies reconstruct offices with plentiful amenities for their employees.\n\nWall Street titan JPMorgan Chase is a prime example, opening a $3 billion headquarters with perks including lunch being delivered deskside and a sprawling health and wellness center.\n\nWhen it opens, 270 Park Ave. \u2013 New York City\u2019s largest all-electric tower \u2013 will become the new home for 14,000 employees. Designed by architect Norman Foster, the building will \"define the modern workplace with 21st century infrastructure\" by boasting smart technology and 2.5 million square feet of flexible and collaborative space, according to JPMorgan.\n\nAMERICA\u2019S OFFICES ARE THE EMPTIEST THEY'VE BEEN IN AT LEAST FOUR DECADES, ACCORDING TO REPORT\n\nThe building's biophilic design, an architectural style that increases connectivity to nature, will feature extensive use of natural plants. The building will also provide 30% more daylight than a typical developer-led, speculative office building and incorporate circadian lighting to reduce the impact of electric light and promote a healthier indoor environment.\n\nWhen the plan behind the new global headquarters was unveiled in 2022, the company said it was partnering with experts including Joseph Allen, director of Harvard University\u2019s healthy buildings program, and wellness expert Deepak Chopra. It also parented with Union Square Hospitality Group\u2019s Danny Meyer, who has been advising JPMorgan on a \"wellness and hospitality experience\" for employees, which includes a food hall featuring diverse food operators and healthy menus.\n\nDavid Arena, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s head of global real estate, told Fortune that Meyer is helping JPMorgan, the largest US bank with about $4 trillion in assets, create an environment like \"Eataly or something even better.\"\n\nWALMART TO CUT JOBS, RELOCATE SOME EMPLOYEES TO MAIN HUBS\n\nThere are 19 different restaurants, some of which include table service.

Its advanced HVAC filtration systems will also continually clean outdoor air as it comes into the building, while also cleaning recirculated air.\n\nThere will be 50% more communal spaces and 25% more volume of space per person, offering more flexible choices for workers, according to JPMorgan.

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM, Financial) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-02-18, JPMorgan Chase & Co's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $376.67. It's currently trading at a price of $276.59. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 26.57%. The company is modestly undervalued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. JPMorgan Chase & Co's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $18.02 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.52%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 14.00%\n\nYears of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4%\n\nYears of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 209.32 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 167.35 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 376.67\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $-517.61. This valuation indicates that the JPMorgan Chase & Co is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 153.44%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.\n\nHere are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\n\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\n\nThe DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\n\nGrowth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\n\nThe model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance.

(FDIC) to gauge the depth of connections between banks, buyout firms and the fast-growing private lending sector.\n\nAccording to the report, regulators had given banks until Feb. 4 to share their year-end exposure to different types of \u201cnon-bank financial institutions\u201d on a \u201cbest-efforts basis,\u201d with most of America\u2019s big banks complying.\n\nHowever, the FT said, JPMorgan Chase \u2014 the largest lender in the country \u2014 listed all of the $133 billion it had lent to non-banks as \u201cother\u201d in a report filed with the FDIC, rather than breaking these loans down by types of borrowers.\n\nThe $133 billion figure, the report noted, is greater than the total loans of all but a handful of the country\u2019s biggest banks.\n\nA source familiar with JPMorgan\u2019s decision told the FT that the bank believed it faced an \u201coperational risk\u201d by reporting its loan categories one way to the FDIC and another to the Federal Reserve, which has kept its past reporting requirements and guidelines for disclosing loans to non-banks.\n\nAs covered here last year, the private credit market is a nearly $2 trillion business, with several banking giants partnering with companies in that space.\n\n\u201cNon-banks have become some of the most important and potentially risky borrowers of the large U.S. banks,\u201d Viral Acharya of New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business told the FT. \u201cRight now the only one who has a picture of how much of a risk this is, it\u2019s the Fed, and only of the banks that it stress tests.\u201d\n\nThe rise of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) \u2014 also known as shadow banks or non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs) \u2014 has drawn scrutiny from regulators like the Fed, FDIC and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\n\u201cThe risks have been highlighted in recent months, and the risks transcend borders,\u201d PYMNTS wrote late last year.\n\nDuring the summer of 2024, Financial Stability Board Chair Klaas Knot warned that recent \u201cincidents of market stress and liquidity strains\u201d have been tied to NBFIs.\n\nHowever, the regulatory landscape in the U.S. has been changing under a new presidential administration, one which is reportedly considering folding the FDIC into other agencies or limiting its power.",

Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and another that called for US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,\u201d Trump told business leaders and politicians last month during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research, the National Legal and Policy Center, and the Heritage Foundation have all submitted shareholder proposals seeking changes or deeper examinations of practices at several big banks.",

            "content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon has been emphatic about employees returning to the office (RTO) to work, dismissing hybrid or work-from-home (WFH) options for his workforce. During the recent company town hall on February 12, one staff member who disagreed was allegedly fired for questioning Dimon about the RTO policy, according to a Forbes report.\n\nEmployee Nicolas Welch managed a front-row seat at the 45-minute town hall of around 1,000 staff and others on Zoom and raised the issue for himself and his team, the report said.\n\nAlso Read | US Digital Service employees face layoffs as Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE team takes over\n\nWhat Did the JPMorgan Employee Say to Jamie Dimon? The report noted that Welch, an analyst in tech ops, has worked for the bank since 2017. He told the publication he is going through a divorce and flexible work times would help deal with family and childcare. Welch works out of the Polaris office, which has headquarters in Ohio and serves 12,000 people. To his good fortune, the RTO memo has not yet arrived there.\n\nHe thanked Dimon for \u201clistening to an old hillbilly like me\" and explained how his team comprises seven employees across different countries like Argentina, India, and the United States \u2014 all working in different time zones. He suggested: \u201cThere is no way that being in an office makes any difference for us specifically. So, all I\u2019m asking is that\u2014I\u2019m not suggesting you rescind such an order\u2014but suggesting it be left up to managers of individual teams themselves on [the] necessity of an office workplace.\u201d\n\nWelch's statement was met with audience applause, and throughout the day, co-workers hi-fived and thanked him, the report added. Forbes has a recording of the town hall interaction.\n\n'No Chance' Says Jamie Dimon, Goes on Rant Forbes reported that Dimon can be heard going off on the employee and accusing managers of abusing the company's hybrid work policies. \u201cThat\u2019s it? I\u2019m going to give you a complete answer. There is no chance that I would leave that up to managers. Zero chance. The abuse that took place was extraordinary,\u201d Dimon said.\n\nHe also complained about employees \u201cwasting time\u201d during Zoom meetings and complained about how staff strength has \u201cballooned\u201d by 50,000 in the past four to five years. \u201cWe don\u2019t need all those people. We were putting people in jobs because people weren\u2019t doing the jobs they were hired to do in [the] first place,\u201d Dimon said.\n\nThe report said that sometime later in the town hall too, Dimon spoke against an employee petition seeking a withdrawal of the RTO mandate. \u201cI don\u2019t care how many people sign that f***ing petition,\u201d Dimon said.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has ordered all 317,233 employees back to offices. At present 40 per cent of these work from home two days a week as part of a hybrid schedule.\n\nFired... the Retained? How Events Unfolded Welch's day turned for the worse with a text from Garrett Monaghan, a Vice President - Branch HelpDesk, stating: \"I don\u2019t know what the f**k you just did, but come to my desk immediately when that town hall ends. Please\" (sic) Monaghan was Welch superior from 2022-23 and both work in JPM's Technology Employee Support Services (TESS).\n\nAt the afternoon meeting, Welch was met by Monaghan and Jeffrey Todd Merrill, Vice President \u2013 Global Dedicated IT Support (also Welch boss from 2018-21), who told him to \"Go and clean off your desk and get the f**k out of here.\" (sic)\n\nThen at 4.30 pm Megan Mead, executive director, director of global IT support (TESS), said she had \u201csmoothed things over\u201d and that Welch was still hired with JPM. She also texted him, saying: \u201cI appreciate you, Nic and I am really proud about how you responded to a pretty unfair circumstance.\u201d\n\nMonaghan, Merrill and Mead did not respond to queries, according to the Fortune report.",

These are the kids who are fresh out of college who feel that they are entitled to everything work from home because that's all they've ever known. They started working during COVID so they think it's normal to be remote. Well, unfortunately for them, it's not. You can only fake work for so long until your company catches on. Oh, and everything he said is true. He's just finally allowed to call it out because he's no longer afraid of being demonized in the media. The culture has shifted. The pendulum has swung.\n\nNow, having said that, there is a major disconnect between Jamie and his employees. The thing that Jamie doesn't understand is that the younger generation of workers are simply not as committed to their job as he is...and that's fine. That's why he's the CEO and they are not, but you can't ignore the fact that this call was awesome. Refreshing even. I love a tyrant of a CEO as long as I'm not on the receiving end of their wrath. Thoughts and prayers to the employees of JPMorgan as they navigate this next chapter. At least they're being paid for it.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Best Financial Sector Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against other best financial sector dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nIn 2024, financial stocks have led the market, delivering one of the strongest performances among all sectors. While the broader financial sector is expected to continue its upward trajectory, certain stocks within the group appear even better positioned for growth. The broader market\u2019s financial sector has climbed nearly 30% this year, surpassing the overall market and even outperforming the technology sector, which includes many of the high-profile mega-cap tech stocks. The financial index is up by over 7% since the start of 2025.\n\nThe US banking sector continued to expand in the third quarter of 2024, despite sluggish loan growth. The industry saw a 1.4% sequential increase in total assets during the period. Collectively, the 50 largest US banks added $377.22 billion in aggregate assets during the third quarter, with 35 institutions reporting growth, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. This marked a turnaround from the second quarter when the top 50 banks saw a combined decline of $128.01 billion from the first quarter of the year. The report further mentioned that as of September 30, the total assets of the 50 largest US banks stood at $23.985 trillion. Among the 39 banks with assets ranging from $50 billion to $500 billion, 25 recorded an increase in assets during the third quarter.\n\nAlso read: 10 Low PE High Dividend Stocks to Buy Now\n\nFinancial stocks experienced a sharp and widespread rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the 2024 presidential election. This surge was largely fueled by market optimism surrounding a potentially more relaxed regulatory environment in 2025, particularly in relation to mergers and acquisitions. In November, the median total return for the 211 banks tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence climbed to 13.4%, significantly outpacing the broader market\u2019s 5.9% gain.\n\nAnother key factor influencing bank performance was the Federal Reserve\u2019s release of parameters for its annual industry stress test. The 2025 test outlined less severe economic shocks than previous years, although it still projected a rise in U.S. unemployment to 10% and a 33% decline in home prices. Compared to prior tests, the latest scenario included milder increases in joblessness and less drastic drops in stock and real estate values. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg emphasized these adjustments in his report, \u201c2025 Stress Test: Scenarios Easier than Past Two Years.\u201d Meanwhile, Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala suggested that the test\u2019s reduced stringency and greater predictability could lead banks to hold smaller capital buffers later in the year.\n\nThe financial sector is cyclical, meaning its performance is closely tied to the overall health of the economy. The US economy has maintained steady momentum, increasing the likelihood of a \u201csoft landing\u201d\u2014a scenario that would help ease concerns about a potential mild recession that could weigh on financial stocks. According to analysts, a key shift heading into 2025 compared to previous years is the outlook for interest rates. The second half of 2024 marked the start of a new rate cycle, with the Federal Reserve implementing its first rate cut since the early stages of the pandemic. For banks, interest rate changes present both opportunities and challenges. While higher rates can boost net interest margins, rate fluctuations can also impact lending activity and overall profitability.\n\nInvestor enthusiasm for financial stocks is on the rise, driven in large part by their appealing dividend payouts. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the financial sector saw headline growth of 7.7% growth in dividend payouts on a YoY basis. The report also mentioned that the industry paid $72 billion in dividends in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and identified dividend stocks from the finance sector. These companies offer a wide range of financial services, including banking, insurance, investment management, and financial planning. The stocks mentioned below also offer stable dividend yields. From the resultant list, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment towards them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), one of the largest banks in the US, has a strong presence in commercial banking, financial transaction processing, and asset management. In fiscal year 2024, the bank delivered record earnings, posting an annual profit of $58.5 billion\u2014an 18% increase from the previous year. This growth was largely fueled by its dealmakers and traders benefiting from a market rebound in the fourth quarter. However, net interest income (NII) declined 3% year-over-year to $23.5 billion in Q4 2024, marking its first drop since 2021.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is recognized as a leading dividend stock, having maintained consistent dividend payments to shareholders since 1972. In the most recent quarter, the company reinforced its commitment to investor returns by distributing $3.5 billion in dividends. It currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.81%, as of February 16.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has outperformed the market in the past 12 months, surging by over 54%. The company\u2019s strong performance has been largely driven by its emphasis on investment banking and wealth management. In the fourth quarter of 2024, investment banking fees jumped 49% year-over-year, reflecting heightened client activity. At the same time, the Asset & Wealth Management division posted a 25% rise in net income, reaching $1.5 billion, supported by record client inflows that expanded assets under management.\n\nOverall, JPM ranks 1st on our list of best financial sector dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for JPM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JPM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "A JPMorgan techie whose question at a company town hall triggered an extraordinary work-from-home rant by the chairman claims he was briefly fired over it.\n\nNicolas Welch was sitting front row at the meeting in Columbus, Ohio, on Wednesday and asked the third question of chairman and chief executive Jamie Dimon.\n\nThe self-confessed 'old hillbilly' said he, a tech analyst at the bank since 2017, worked in a team with members across four time zones from India to Argentina.\n\n'There is no way that being in an office makes any difference for us specifically,' he said, in audio that lit up the internet this week over Dimon's response.\n\n'So, all I'm asking is that - I'm not suggesting you rescind such an order - but suggesting it be left up to managers of individual teams themselves on [the] necessity of an office workplace.'\n\nDimon responded with a long rant against working from home, and defended his earlier order dragging all employees back into the office five days a week.\n\n'That's it? I'm going to give you a complete answer. There is no chance that I would leave that up to managers. Zero chance,' he said.\n\n'The abuse that took place is extraordinary. You may be a great manager, but\u2026 I\u2019m going to give you examples of how bad it got. OK?'\n\nJPMorgan techie Nicolas Welch, whose question at a company town hall triggered an extraordinary work-from-home rant by the chairman, claims he was briefly fired over it\n\nDimon responded with a long rant against working from home, and defended his earlier order dragging all employees back into the office five days a week\n\nWelch told Fortune magazine that after the town hall, he was summoned to a meeting with his former boss Garrett Monaghan, now a vice president but still with the same division.\n\n'I don't know what the f**k you just did, but come to my desk immediately when that town hall ends. Please,' the text read.\n\nWelch said when he arrived at the office, he was pulled into a meeting with Jeffrey Merrill, another of his former bosses from 2018 to 2021 who was now a VP.\n\nHe claimed Monaghan told him he 'just dragged our whole organization through the mud. Go and clean off your desk and get the f**k out of here'.\n\nWelch grabbed what little he left in the office, which as he worked remotely two days a week was just a coat and headphone, and walked outside.\n\nHe texted his direct boss, IT support Customer success manager Richard Cundiff, from the car park - who, like Dimon said in the town hall, had moved to Florida.\n\nHe told him Monaghan had 'threatened my job, so I've been ordered home', to which Cundiff replied, 'Thanks for letting me know.'\n\nWelch asked to speak with Welch's boss, but she was on holiday and Cundiff told him 'I will inform her in our next meeting'.\n\nHe went home and assumed he no longer had a job.\n\nJPMorgan's offices in Columbus, Ohio, where Welch works\n\nBut hours later he got a call from, Megan Mead, who heads up all of global IT support as part of the Technology Employee Support Services division, and outranked Monaghan, Merrill, and Cundiff.\n\nMead told him he wasn't fired and she had 'smoothed things over' with Monaghan, during the 45-minute conversation from 4.30pm.\n\n'I appreciate you, Nic and I am really proud about how you responded to a pretty unfair circumstance,' Mead wrote in a follow-up text message.\n\nMonaghan, chastened by his boss, sent a text at 5.14pm to apologize for overreacting and admit he owed him a beer.\n\n'I agree with your message, if not the delivery. We good?' he wrote.\n\nJPMorgan insisted Welch was never actually fired, regardless of Monaghan's outburst.\n\n'He didn\u2019t say anything wrong in the town hall,' the firm told Fortune.\n\nActually firing Welch would have required filing paperwork and executing other procedures that appeared never to have happened.\n\nWelch laughed about the saga on Reddit the day after, saying: 'I was in the front row, I was the one who asked the question. It was AMAZING.\n\n'I am satisfied that he was goaded in to dropping F-Bombs on a recorded meeting. When I got back to my desk, I was screamed at (with witnesses) to \"get the F**K out of this office!\"'\n\nCEO of Chase Jamie Dimon (L) and wife Judith Kent arrive for a State Dinner in honor of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, at the Booksellers Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 10, 2024\n\nDimon's long, expletive-laden answer to Welch's question was leaked within hours and widely reported by news outlets.\n\nThe longtime boss clarified that he was not against working from home as a concept, and 10 per cent of JPMorgan staff worked remotely in a way that worked.\n\nHowever, he said he came to the realization that hybrid working wasn't working for the rest of the company, and was causing huge inefficiencies.\n\n'Now, your manager moved to Florida. We never made a promise that it would be forever. That\u2019s their problem, not mine,' he said.\n\n'So people said, \u2018We moved, we didn\u2019t move\u2019 - we always told people that we were going to be a work-from-the-office type of company.\n\n'And so we allowed three days and two days. But here are the problems, OK? And they are substantial\u2026the young generation is being damaged by this.\n\n'They may or may not be in your particular staff, but they are being left behind. They\u2019re being left behind socially, ideas, meeting people.\n\n'In fact, my guess is most of you live in communities a hell of a lot less diverse than this room.'\n\nWelch was sitting front row at the meeting in Columbus, Ohio, on Wednesday and asked the third question of Dimon, prompting his now-infamous response\n\nDimon also railed against the 'rudeness' of staff fiddling with their phones and not paying attention during Zoom calls, which he said 'slows down efficiency, creativity'.\n\n'When I found out that people were doing that - you don\u2019t do that in my goddamn meetings. If you\u2019re going to meet with me, you\u2019ve got my attention, you\u2019ve got my focus, I don\u2019t bring my goddamn phone, I\u2019m not sending texts to people,' he said.\n\n'It simply doesn\u2019t work. It doesn\u2019t work for creativity, it slows down decision-making.\n\n'And don\u2019t give me this s**t that work-from-home-Friday works. I call a lot of people on Fridays, and there\u2019s not a goddamn person you can get a hold of.'\n\nDimon acknowledged the need for flexibility, particularly for mothers and caregivers, but said managers failed to manage to properly and it got out of hand.\n\n'They didn\u2019t manage, they were making exceptions, and people making exceptions for exceptions, and meanwhile, head count has gone up by 50,000 people in four, five years,' he said.\n\n'We don\u2019t need all those people. We were putting people in jobs because the people weren\u2019t doing the job they were hired to do in the first place. It simply doesn\u2019t work.\n\n'I will not be responsible for a company like that, OK, and I\u2019m sorry. Now - you have a choice. You don\u2019t have to work at JPMorgan. So the people of you who don\u2019t want to work at the company, that\u2019s fine with me.'\n\n@barrons EXCLUSIVE: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon offered up candid, lengthy thoughts about remote work, bureaucracy, and inefficiency during an internal town-hall meeting in Ohio on Wednesday, according to audio recordings of his remarks obtained by Barron\u2019s. #jamiedimon #jpmorgan \u266c original sound - Barron\u2019s\n\nDimon then went off on a tangent about the firm having too much bureaucracy that needed to be reined in, and asked for suggestions from staff.\n\n'We\u2019re going to build a great company, and we\u2019re going to be disciplined and detailed and factual and honest and hardworking, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to do it. And honest with each other,' he said.\n\n'So, anyway, the bureaucracy stuff - if you have brilliant ideas, send them to me.'\n\nAt another point in the town hall, Dimon was questioned about a petition against his WFH policy change that garnered more than 1,550 signatures.\n\nIn a recording reviewed by Reuters, Dimon said: 'Don\u2019t waste time on it. I don\u2019t care how many people sign that f**king petition.'\n\nJPMorgan's profits surged to a record in 2024, and its share price roughly doubled in the past five years.\n\nThe strong performance prompted some workers to question why they needed to spend more time in the office.",

I don\u2019t like wasted money in bureaucracy.\"\n\nJP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Michel Euler/Pool via REUTERS (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nDimon was not specific about what he would cancel. He also said the bank\u2019s approach to Black, Hispanic, and LGBTQ communities would not change, and that any plans for certain DEI initiatives were unrelated to Donald Trump\u2019s election as president.\n\nWhat was notable about Dimon's new comments is how outspoken he has been about his willingness to fight outside efforts to change JPMorgan\u2019s DEI policies.\n\n\"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last month.\n\nSome of the biggest companies on Wall Street, including JPMorgan, are increasingly targets of conservative activists seeking changes to DEI policies across corporate America.\n\nOver the past year, such pressure has contributed to DEI retreats at a number of other high-profile companies, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), John Deere (DE), and Target (TGT).\n\nMany of these retreats were influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.\n\nCorporate diversity goals are also coming under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and another that called for US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,\u201d Trump told business leaders and politicians last month during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research, the National Legal and Policy Center, and the Heritage Foundation have all submitted shareholder proposals seeking changes or deeper examinations of practices at several big banks.\n\nNCPPR and NLPC submitted anti-DEI proposals to Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan, while Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) got proposals from NLPC and Heritage asking for audits of how the banks treat customers with certain political beliefs.\n\nRobby Starbuck, who built a social media following by criticizing companies for their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, has also set JPMorgan in his sights.\n\n\"JPMorgan ... they are going to end up being a target for us,\" the conservative Latino activist told Yahoo Finance recently.\n\nA spokesman for JPMorgan said this past week that the company's outlook on DEI isn\u2019t changing but that the company \"regularly review[s] and make appropriate adjustments to policies and programs, including in the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision in 2023.\"\n\nThe DEI \"moniker means different things to different people,\" but for JPMorgan, it is \"about doing what we\u2019ve done for decades \u2014 trying our best to ensure that every customer and employee has a fair opportunity and that we serve communities and grow our company,\u201d the JPMorgan spokesman said.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s crosstown New York rival, Goldman, revealed a DEI change of its own this past week. It dropped a pledge to avoid taking a company public if that company had an all-white male board.\n\nGoldman\u2019s Tony Fratto, global head of corporate communications, said in a statement that \u201cas a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy.\u201d\n\nGoldman would not comment on whether it plans to hold firm on its other DEI policies posted on its website, which include advancing diversity along race, gender, and sexual orientation lines within hiring, employee mentorship and networks, vendor selection, and capital allocation.\n\nGoldman Sachs headquarters in Manhattan. (Spencer Grant/GHI/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) (UCG via Getty Images)\n\nGoldman said that even though its IPO mandate is now gone, it still plans to offer its board diversity initiative to interested clients through its major global banking and markets division.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach,\u201d Fratto said.\n\nThe conservative activist asking Goldman\u2019s shareholders to approve an audit of the Wall Street giant\u2019s DEI policies said the retreat doesn\u2019t go far enough.\n\n\"Had they come to us first and said, \u2018would you withdraw your proposal if we do this,\u2019 I think we would pretty easily have said \u2018yes\u2019,\" Stefan Padfield, executive director of National Center for Public Policy Research\u2019s (NCPPR) Free Enterprise Project, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nNCPPR has already notched one prominent Wall Street win. It was a co-plaintiff in a lawsuit that resulted in a December ruling that rejected Nasdaq\u2019s requirement that companies on its exchange set racial and gender targets.\n\nThe group, which engaged with Goldman earlier this year, is asking the bank to conduct an independent third-party \u201cracial discrimination\u201d audit analyzing Goldman\u2019s \u201clegal and reputational risks stemming from its race-based initiatives.\u201d\n\nThe IPO pledge abandoned by Goldman was among those initiatives highlighted by NCPPR. But it wants more changes.\n\nNow \u201cif they come back to the table and ask us to withdraw the proposal, we're going to have to have additional movement because they've already committed to do this, and they did not talk to us,\u201d Padfield added.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

However, Dimon\u2019s recent remarks suggest a shift in perspective, especially regarding unconscious bias training and other DEI programs that may not have proven effective or necessary.\n\nPrevious Commitments : JPMorgan had previously introduced large-scale DEI programs, such as the $30 billion pledge and specific employee training.\n\n: JPMorgan had previously introduced large-scale DEI programs, such as the $30 billion pledge and specific employee training. Dimon\u2019s Remarks: The CEO\u2019s comments raised doubts about the efficacy of certain initiatives, particularly unconscious bias training, which he viewed as potentially ineffective.\n\nThis change in stance is noteworthy, considering the bank\u2019s previous dedication to enhancing diversity and inclusion across its operations. The future of JPMorgan\u2019s DEI initiatives remains uncertain, as the bank has not provided further details on which specific programs could face cuts.\n\nConcerns Over DEI Spending\n\nDimon\u2019s comments on DEI spending have sparked discussions regarding the efficacy and financial impact of these programs. While JPMorgan has committed substantial resources to advancing DEI, the CEO\u2019s recent statements indicate a more cautious approach moving forward.\n\nFinancial Concerns : Dimon\u2019s suggestion that some programs could be deemed unnecessary reflects concerns over the financial effectiveness of the bank\u2019s DEI initiatives.\n\n: Dimon\u2019s suggestion that some programs could be deemed unnecessary reflects concerns over the financial effectiveness of the bank\u2019s DEI initiatives. Program Review: The bank has not yet identified which programs would be affected, leaving both employees and stakeholders uncertain.\n\nIt is unclear which initiatives will be reviewed or reduced, leaving investors and employees speculating about the bank\u2019s future direction on diversity and inclusion.\n\nImpact on JPMorgan Chase\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s shift in approach to DEI could have broader implications, especially in terms of investor perception and employee morale. As the bank considers which programs to scale back, the overall impact on the company\u2019s corporate culture, public image, and stakeholder relationships will be crucial to monitor.\n\nPublic Perception : The change could affect how JPMorgan is perceived by both its clients and the general public, particularly regarding its commitment to social responsibility.\n\n: The change could affect how JPMorgan is perceived by both its clients and the general public, particularly regarding its commitment to social responsibility. Employee Morale: The shift in focus could have an impact on employee satisfaction, especially those involved in DEI programs.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for JPM?\n\nJPMorgan Chase has a Moderate Buy consensus rating from analysts, based on 12 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sells in the past three months. Following a 58% increase in its share price over the past year, the average price target for JPM stands at $275.60 per share, suggesting the stock is near its fair value.\n\nImportant HIghlights:",

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\n\nLast weekend, the Trump administration ordered effectively all work at the CFPB to halt and barred employees from showing up to the agency\u2019s Washington, D.C., headquarters this week.\n\nMany Republicans have opposed the CFPB since its creation and have often called for its closure, arguing that Washington has too many redundant regulators.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is also reportedly discussing plans to consolidate other bank regulators without Congress\u2019s input, according to a Wednesday report in the Wall Street Journal. The discussions include possibly folding the FDIC into the Treasury Department and combining it with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\nDimon on Thursday did not sound overly concerned about the fate of the CFPB, which oversees how banks and other financial firms treat US consumers.\n\n\"There is consumer protection out of the SEC, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, and the question is how do you design a system that is good for everybody, that makes sense.

Recent actions included a halt to the agency\u2019s activities and restrictions on its employees.\n\nThe administration is also reportedly exploring the idea of merging other bank regulators without Congress\u2019 input, such as folding the FDIC into the Treasury Department and combining it with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\nAlthough the CFPB\u2019s future remains uncertain, Dimon noted that other agencies also provide consumer protection: \"There is consumer protection out of the SEC, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, and the question is how do you design a system that is good for everybody, that makes sense. It isn\u2019t just for the CFPB alone.\"\n\nDebanking: A growing concern\n\nThe topic of \u2018debanking\u2019 emerged as a central issue during Dimon\u2019s meeting with Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, other committee Republicans, and many of the nation\u2019s other top banking CEOs.\n\nDimon reaffirmed that JPMorgan does not debank people based on their political or religious affiliations. However, he acknowledged that certain regulatory rules, especially those related to anti-money laundering, are causing banks to pull back from customers to avoid penalties over the fear of large fines and lawsuits, citing regulators as a cause for the situation.\n\nThe topic of big banks discriminating against certain customers has gained attention as the GOP presses for legislation that would better define when banks can decline service, the crypto industry has also alleged that digital asset companies have been unfairly denied banking services.\n\nPresident Trump also weighed in on the debanking issue at the World Economic Forum in Davos, urging to Dimon and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan: \u201cI hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank.\u201d\n\nTrump further stated: \"I don't know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody else, I hope you open your banks to conservatives because what you're doing is wrong,\" highlighting the concerns from right-leaning individuals who feel excluded from the banking system.\n\nHowever, notable Democrat Elizabeth Warren also drew support, saying: \"Donald Trump was on to a real problem when he criticised Bank of America for its debanking practices.\".\n\nFollowing the meeting, Scott, criticised regulatory overreach, stating: \"It\u2019s clear that regulators have seriously overreached on issues from Basel III to debanking, and Congress needs to work to rein in and right-size the impacts of the Biden administration\u2019s burdensome and arbitrary regulations.\n\n\"My message is clear: no regulator, and no financial institution, is above the principles of fairness and market access.\"",

According to a Fortune report, this has caused strong indignation among employees and they claimed that the policy unfairly impacts women, caregivers, senior employees, and people with disabilities.More than 1,200 JPMorgan staff members signed a petition asking the firm to rethink the mandate, supporting more flexible hybrid work arrangements, as per Fortune.As per reports, several JPMorgan staff have claimed that the return-to-office plan is a regression, arguing that it will damage morale, staff retention, and cost-effectiveness. For them, hybrid working arrangements have worked well for staff and the organization, enhancing work-life balance and collaboration.But Dimon was stern with his decision at the town hall, he said \"Don't waste time on it. I don't care how many people sign that petition,\" as quoted by Reuters.His response mirrors his long-held view that having everyone in the office for five days a week is the optimal template for the bank's success, as per Fortune. Dimon said, \u201cI\u2019ve been working seven days a goddamn week since COVID, and I come in, and\u2014where is everybody else?\u201d as quoted in Barron\u2019s report.Despite the criticism, Dimon is steadfast in the long-term objectives of the company. According to Barron\u2019s report, JPMorgan has 14,000 vacancies at present, and Dimon stressed that while there are planned layoffs in 2025, the firm remains committed to hiring new people.Dimon has declared that he will not let managers give hybrid work permission to employees. According to Fortune, Dimon cited that workers abusing remote work, particularly on Fridays, a popular work-from-home day. He said \"Don't give me that work-from-home Friday works,\" as quoted in the report. \"I call a lot of people on Fridays, and there's not a goddamn person you can get a hold of.\"It is doubtful that JPMorgan will change its position on the RTO, as per the Fortune report. He ended the town hall by emphasizing that workers can choose to leave if they do not agree with the company's strategy. The CEO said \"It's a free world,\" as quoted by Fortune.Dimon was dismissive of the petition and said \u201cDon\u2019t waste time on it. I don\u2019t care how many people sign that petition.\u201d According to him, the five-day office work model is essential for the company\u2019s success and won\u2019t be swayed by employee protests.Yes, Dimon mentioned that there are currently 14,000 open positions, this move is part of the company's ongoing commitment to growth and talent acquisition.",

It is planning more cuts later this year, the source said, requesting anonymity discussing confidential information.\n\nThe operating environment for the banking sector has improved considerably, with JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, earning its highest-ever annual profit in 2024.\n\nWall Street profits have surged in recent months as dealmaking and fundraising activities rebounded against the backdrop of a strong U.S. economy.\n\nIndustry executives have stayed bullish even as the Trump administration announced a slew of economic and regulatory policy shifts that fueled uncertainty.\n\nWhile JPMorgan expects market activity to pick up this year, it has said some companies are staying on the sidelines as they wait for more clarity on economic policies.\n\nIts investment banking fee has grown by a mid-teens percentage so far in the first quarter as clients' economic optimism grows, Chief Operating Officer Jennifer Piepszak said on Tuesday.\n\nReporting by Manya Saini and Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath and Arun Koyyur",

Chase is central Ohio's largest employer with more than 20,000 workers.\n\nEmployees at the largest U.S. bank have complained on internal message boards and chats about losing hybrid working arrangements, and one group launched an online petition urging Dimon to reconsider.\n\nWhen asked about the in-person work policy during the staff meeting, he said: \"Don't waste time on it. I don't care how many people sign that (expletive) petition,\" he said, drawing some laughter.\n\nJPMorgan declined to comment.\n\nInstead, Dimon demanded more efficiency and stressed employees have a choice whether to work at JPMorgan. The CEO told them not to be mad at him, and said it was a free country.\n\nThe rollback of remote working policies has prompted groans from some workers as COVID lockdowns receded. JPMorgan's call for more workers to come back brought a deluge of complaints, many from back-office workers.\n\nSome employees sought advice from the Communications Workers of America on how they might set up a labor union, a rare thing in the U.S. finance sector, CWA campaign lead Nick Wiener said.\n\nAbout 950 people had signed the petition against the five-day policy by Wednesday evening. JPMorgan has more than 317,000 employees worldwide.\n\nDimon, who has run the lender for 19 years, said some staff did not pay attention during Zoom meetings, which reduced their efficiency and creativity.\n\nChase CEO in Columbus: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon talks Trump, tariffs, DEI and remote work at Columbus event\n\nJPMorgan's profits surged to a record in 2024 and its share price has roughly doubled in the past five years. The strong performance prompted some workers to question why they needed to spend more time in the office.\n\nIn-office requirements will not be left up to managers, Dimon said.\n\n\"There is no chance that I will leave it up to managers,\" he said. \"Zero chance. The abuse that took place is extraordinary.\"\n\nDimon's view is shared by many Wall Street leaders and President Donald Trump, who demanded the end of remote work arrangements in the federal government. Several other Columbus employers, including AEP, Huntington Bank and state government have recently said they will require workers to come to the office more.\n\nDimon has asked all of the bank's departments to show 10% gains in efficiency, which would entail 10% cuts in reports, meetings, documents and training sessions.\n\nDuring the town hall, Dimon recounted a story about a wealth management matter that required 14 committee approvals.\n\n\"I feel like firing 14 chairmen of committees, I can't stand it anymore,\" he said. \"I'm sorry. It's my fault. I'm the boss.\"\n\nHe also cited performance reviews for the bank's operating committee that could stretch to six pages.\n\n\"Because of legal and risk, they have to look at it, the regulators might say, there could be litigation around it, so you have to be careful,\" Dimon said. \"I get the thing, I throw it in the (expletive) garbage can.\"\n\nIn the wide-ranging conversation, one questioner asked how Dimon felt about Trump's decision to stop work at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Dimon said some consumer protection rules were good, but that the CFPB had overstepped its authority, echoing mixed feelings across the industry. He used an expletive to describe former director Rohit Chopra.\n\nA spokesperson for Chopra declined to comment.\n\nDimon was also asked about hiring.\n\nThe bank is working to keep headcount flat, and \"we continue to invest in hiring new professionals where appropriate and currently have 14,000 open positions,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nReporting by Isla Binnie, additional reporting by Tatiana Bautzer and Nupur Anand in New York, editing by Lananh Nguyen, Megan Davies, Gerry Doyle and Chris Reese",

As Bloomberg News reported Thursday (Feb. 13), Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-S.C.) was leading a roundtable with banking executives to discuss the issue.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t debank people for their religious or political affiliations,\u201d JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said on his way into the meeting, per Bloomberg.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged \u201cserious problems\u201d and said debanking needs to be discussed. He cited issues relating to anti-money laundering (AML) and financial crime rules.\n\n\u201cThe AML/Fincen rules are extraordinary, and it does cause a lot of people to be pushed out of the system because banks were afraid of being sued, fined, because if after the fact something goes wrong \u2014 coulda, woulda, shoulda \u2014 you could pay a billion dollars,\u201d Dimon told reporters.\n\nScheduled to join Dimon in the meeting were the CEOs of Bank of America, Wells Fargo, US Bancorp, PNC, Truist and Capital One, the Bloomberg report added.\n\nAs covered here late last year, several figures in the cryptocurrency and FinTech space have been warning about \u201cdebanking,\u201d accusing the financial sector of shutting out conservatives.\n\nFinTech and crypto investor Marc Andreessen last year, during an appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast, alleged that dozens of companies backed by his namesake firm, Andreessen Horowitz, were being fundamentally \u201cdebanked\u201d by American financial institutions (FIs).\n\nThe cause was taken up by Elon Musk, now a central figure in the new Trump administration, who posted about the issue on his X platform.\n\nBut as PYMNTS wrote, the reality here could be much more nuanced than a political assault on crypto and FinTech, with tensions between traditional banks and upstart FinTech and crypto firms stemming from outdated regulations and, as Dimon noted, stricter standards for things like preventing money laundering.\n\n\u201cAt the heart of the issue is potentially the lack of a clear, comprehensive regulatory framework to address the unique risks posed by the FinTech and cryptocurrency industries,\u201d that report said. \u201cFinancial institutions, tasked with navigating a labyrinth of overlapping and often contradictory rules themselves, can commonly be left with little incentive to take on high-risk clients when the compliance burden could outweigh any potential gains.\u201d",

On February 18, the millennial founder will try to rebut criminal allegations that she lied to JPMorgan Chase as part of a ploy to get the nation\u2019s biggest bank to buy her startup for $175 million.\n\nThe criminal trial, which will take place in lower Manhattan, caps a stunning fall from grace for Javice. In 2021, she was riding high as a media darling who sold her startup, Frank, to JPMorgan Chase after touting it as the \u201cfastest growing college financial planning site.\u201d (You can read Fortune's full story of Javice and JPM here.) In a press release announcing the acquisition, the bank said Frank served five million students at more than 6,000 colleges across the country.\n\nMonths after the deal closed, however, JPMorgan feared they had been duped about the size of Frank. The realization came after the bank sent marketing emails to a batch of 400,000 supposed Frank customers. Only 28% of the emails were delivered, and just 1.1% were opened, according to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s lawsuit against Javice. The bank alleged that Javice, along with codefendant Olivier Amar, Frank\u2019s chief growth officer, used a data scientist to create millions of fake customer accounts that it used to dupe JPMorgan Chase. The bank ended up shutting down the Frank website in January 2023, just weeks after suing Javice in Delaware district court.\n\nIn April 2023, the DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission each filed complaints against Javice, who faces criminal charges including conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud. Each of which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. She was also charged with one count of securities fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nJavice has since been free on a $2 million bond that was secured by her Miami Beach condo and co-signed by her mother and father. Late last year, she convinced Judge Alvin Hellerstein, who is overseeing her case, to remove a clunky 24-hour ankle bracelet she was required to wear because it \u201cimpeded her work as a fitness instructor,\u201d according to court filings.\n\nFormer Frank exec may testify against Javice\n\nJavice\u2019s trial is expected to last three to four weeks with opening statements anticipated on Feb. 20.\n\nOne former prosecutor described Hellerstein, who is 91, as liberal and a good judge to draw for defendants. \u201cEveryone loves him, he\u2019s great,\u201d they said. In September, Hellerstein denied Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to move his hush-money case to federal court.\n\nUnlike securities fraud or insider trading, Javice\u2019s case is simple because it focuses on actual people and what they might have done to get money. \u201cIt centers around the fact of whether [Javice] knowingly lied about this company that she was trying to sell,\u201d said the ex-prosecutor, who declined to speak on the record.",

A little over half the workforce was already working full-time in one of the bank\u2019s offices.\n\nIn the recently drawn-up petition, more than 500 signatories are asking CEO Jamie Dimon to change his mind and keep a hybrid model. They say the company\u2019s new mandate to end hybrid work \u201cis a great leap backward: It hurts employees, customers, shareholders, and the firm\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom a corporate-citizenship perspective, it worsens traffic and pollution while disproportionately pushing out women, caregivers, senior employees, and individuals with disabilities,\u201d the petition says. \u201cMany of these are top performers, and many of them only able to join the workforce under hybrid work rules. This directly contradicts JPMC\u2019s commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion.\u201d\n\nWhen the company announced its plan, many workers expressed their frustration on the company\u2019s internal channels until the company disabled comments. Employees complained the new policy would put a strain on their finances, particularly around child care and commuting costs. Others said it would disrupt their work-life balance, and some even called for unionizing after the announcement was made.\n\nThe pushback at JPMorgan comes as other Wall Street firms and major companies continue to tighten their return-to-office policies.The bank wrote in its January memo \u201cWe know that some of you prefer a hybrid schedule and respectfully understand that not everyone will agree with this decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe feel that now is the right time to solidify our full-time in-office approach. We think it is the best way to run the company,\u201d it continued.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

JPMorgan Chase\u2019s payments processing unit, the world\u2019s largest merchant acquirer, is partnering with Klarna to bring BNPL plans to its merchants.\n\nThe service is set to roll out later this year, allowing some 900,000 businesses that use JPMorgan Payments to offer BNPL financing at the point of sale.\n\nKlarna, which serves 85 million customers globally, has been rapidly expanding in the U.S. Headquartered in Sweden, the company is expected to launch an initial public offering in the U.S. later this year and has also been exploring the possibility of securing an American banking license.\n\nThe partnership with JPMorgan marks another milestone for Klarna, as it continues to build partnerships with major processors to become omnipresent at checkouts globally. Last October, Klarna teamed up with Worldpay to make its services automatically available through Worldpay\u2019s merchant infrastructure. It has also entered into similar partnerships with Adyen and Stripe.\n\n\u201cThis is all about giving merchants and customers more options at checkout,\u201d said Ben Danner, Senior Analyst, Credit and Commercial at Javelin Strategy & Research. \u201cThe partnership with the largest merchant acquirer in the U.S. extends Klarna\u2019s reach immensely ahead of its IPO.\u201d\n\nBringing BNPL Under the Chase Umbrella\n\nBNPL services have been growing rapidly in recent years. Last holiday season, BNPL spending topped $18.6 billion, up from $16.6 billion in 2023 and $14.5 billion in 2022. A report from GlobalData predicts that the U.S. BNPL market will expand at an average annual rate of 21% between 2023 and 2028.\n\nJPMorgan has offered its own BNPL option, Chase Pay Over Time, to its credit card holders since 2020. Last year, the banking giant banned customers from using its credit cards to repay outside BNPL services like Klarna or Affirm, citing that it did \u201cnot generally allow customers to pay for credit products\u201d with their credit cards, according to a statement given to the New York Times.\n\nObservers noted at the time that this move helped bolster JPMorgan Chase\u2019s investment in its own BNPL product.

            "content": "Chana R. Schoenberger\n\nBuy now/pay later lending is a scale game, where it's much easier for lenders to court merchant networks rather than woo individual retailers. That makes Klarna's deal to provide BNPL to JPMorgan Chase's merchant network a major score ahead of the Swedish firm's initial public offering in the U.S.\n\nThe bank will offer Klarna's installment options at the point of sale for more than 900,000 businesses, including interest-free BNPL and other financial options that will be available on the JPMorgan Payments Commerce Solutions Platform. The integration is scheduled to launch later this year. The collaboration enables JPMorgan to broaden credit choices for merchants as more banks offer the product. Klarna gains an opportunity to quickly add merchants and name recognition in the U.S. market, where it faces stiff competition from other banks and payment firms such as Block and PayPal.\n\n\"Inking a deal with the world's largest payment processor is going to provide Klarna with unmatched marketing reach and connectivity to the largest population of merchants,\" said Don Apgar, director of merchant payments for Javelin Strategy & Research. \"The leading enterprise retail brands have widely adopted BNPL, and Klarna has done a good job of capturing a sizable slice of that market.\"\n\nJPMorgan is one of the largest merchant acquirers in the U.S., based on the number of transactions. The bank processed 38 billion payments in 2023, the latest full-year numbers available, according to Statista . That was about 70,000 transactions behind Fiserv, the largest acquirer with just over 38 billion. Other large merchant acquirers in the U.S. include FIS with 33 billion payments, Global Payments with 12 billion and Wells Fargo, the second largest bank merchant acquirer with 9.7 billion payments. JPMorgan was the largest merchant acquirer by volume, with $1.8 trillion in payments, ahead of Fiserv with $1.6 trillion.\n\nThe partnership is aimed at expanding JPMorgan's options for its merchant services clients and is not aimed at consumers. JPMorgan in October 2024 imposed a ban on using Chase credit cards to pay for installment loans from non-Chase apps, such as Klarna, Affirm, Afterpay and others. Chase allows credit card customers to split individual payments on their card statements into three, six or 12 monthly installments from within the Chase banking app, for a fee. The Klarna partnership does not change JPMorgan's policy regarding bank-issued credit cards, a JPMorgan spokesperson said in an email.\n\nKlarna in November filed a confidential IPO registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Klarna in late October held an estimated valuation of $14.6 billion following an additional investment from one of its shareholders, Chrysalis Investors. Klarna did not answer questions about its planned IPO or its JPMorgan partnership. Klarna's pending listing has drawn attention from the financial services community, which is looking for signs that a multi-year fintech slump is easing. The IPO reportedly is due to launch in April in New York, according to The Financial Times .\n\n\"Klarna's partnership with JP Morgan Payments has the potential to move the needle for [Klarna's] business. It's no coincidence that the deal was announced while Klarna is on an IPO roadshow,\" said Glen Anderson, CEO and Co-Founder of Rainmaker Securities, in an email. Klarna's other distribution partnerships include Stripe , Adyen and Worldpay, among others, Klarna last year sold its checkout unit as part of a pivot to focus more on partnerships. The Swedish firm has also invested heavily in new forms of artificial intelligence to reduce overhead costs, another factor it can pitch to IPO investors.\n\nIn an effort to improve its financial services game, Klarna in early 2024 offered a new version of its Visa debit card that enables consumers to pay in installments with interest, replacing a $4.99-per-month debit card that supported Klarna's traditional installment lending. The updated Klarna Visa card was part of an effort to compete with other BNPL lenders that offer similar cards, such as Affirm and Afterpay .\n\nThe nonbank BNPL market is under pressure and is looking to expand revenue streams with more banks entering the market and regulators investigating BNPL fintechs over concerns about the financial health of borrowers. The fact that the JPMorgan /Klarna partnership is scheduled to launch \"later this year\" would also reinforce the idea of a deeply integrated reseller relationship, not a simple referral deal, according to Apgar. Klarna is creating the foundation for their BNPL program to scale without the expense of having to sign and service every merchant individually, Apgar said.",

Morgan Payments is expanding its buy now, pay later (BNPL) offerings in partnership with Klarna.\n\nThe collaboration lets roughly 900,000 businesses offer Klarna\u2019s installment payment options to customers, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday (Feb. 11). It also means that Klarna, preparing to go public in the U.S. this year, will be available through the biggest merchant acquirer in the world, processing $2 trillion in payments annually.\n\n\u201cWe in the more recent years have become a third party network like Amex and PayPal,\u201d Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna\u2019s CEO, told Bloomberg. \u201cWe are a bank, so this is the natural evolution. We are moving into a world with increased competitive pressure with retail banking services.\u201d\n\nSweden-based Klarna has recently added Stripe, Adyen and Worldpay to its distribution roster, after selling its checkout business in 2023. The company has also been expanding in the U.S., where it is exploring a banking license.\n\nThis would allow Klarna to \u201ccontrol even more customer experience and provide a richer service,\u201d Siemiatkowski said.\n\nBloomberg noted that for J.P. Morgan, the deal extends the banking giant\u2019s BNPL business, this time via its payments unit.\n\nThe news comes days after Siemiatkowski said Klarna would \u201cembrace\u201d cryptocurrency, and asked advocates for the digital currency how to best do so.\n\nJoking that his company was the \u201clast FinTech in the world\u201d to join the crypto race, the CEO added: \u201cBTW all crypto fans. Tell me what we should do with it? \u201cI have some ideas but keen to hear more,\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PYMNTS wrote last week about Klarna\u2019s planned initial public offering (IPO), which could come in April and value the company at as high as $15 billion. However, some factors won\u2019t be determined until Klarna\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) documentation comes through, that report added.\n\n\u201cMuch remains to be seen when the SEC documentation comes through, including Klarna\u2019s own current estimation of market size, potential and a more recent spate of financials,\u201d that report said. \u201cBut then again, the stars are aligning for what might prove to be a timely listing, because some of the fundamentals clearly have momentum.\u201d\n\nA valuation of $15 billion, PYMNTS added, would mark an increase from the $14.6 billion valuation that had been seen as recently as the end of 2024, implied by Klarna\u2019s most recent funding round, and head and shoulders above the $6.7 billion seen in 2022.",

Burger, a CPA who\u2019s handled staggeringly complex bank mergers, is the face of Chase in Columbus, its largest operation in terms of number of employees. Through her role, she\u2019s using her keen understanding of the business world to drive crucial workforce development solutions not only for Chase but also broadly across the Columbus region.\n\nBurger has the ear of the highest levels of leadership at the nation\u2019s largest bank, reporting to New York-based Gordon Smith, co-president and chief operating officer for JPMorgan Chase and a person who has been mentioned among possible successors to CEO Jamie Dimon. Smith says Burger is \u201cexactly the kind of talent we need right now.\n\n\u201cCorrine is collaborative, thoughtful, results-oriented and very personable in her style and approach. She listens to other people, thinks about what it is they have to say and factors their thoughts into her point of view,\u201d Smith says. \u201cWhat makes her a marvelous executive is she\u2019s just very good at laying out a plan, getting the right people on board to deliver what needs to get done and then following it all the way through. And she\u2019s dealt with some really complex issues for us.\u201d\n\nMore: CEO of the Year 2023: Corrine Burger Removes Roadblocks to Success at Chase\n\nSmith says Burger has \u201cdramatically helped us improve our customer experience,\u201d beginning when she was asked to step into operations in the years following the Great Recession and the housing crisis, which for banks were some of the toughest years in memory. \u201cAnd she\u2019s really taken ownership in Columbus,\u201d he says. \u201cShe has become\u2026 I\u2019ll call it the spiritual leader, the head of all of the company\u2019s activities in the Columbus area. She\u2019s somebody who\u2019s able to drive change, take people on a journey. She cares passionately about the community that she lives in.\n\n\u201cAnd you know, I have to say: She\u2019s wonderful when there\u2019s a fire.\u201d\n\nThe Consummate Fixer\n\nIn her precise, understated way, Burger characterizes her contributions to the firm during the fallout from the housing crisis as making process improvements that helped the bank, its customers and its employees. JPMorgan Chase Home Lending CEO Mike Weinbach says she walked straight into a fire.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who have technical skills,\u201d Weinbach says. \u201cI think what really distinguishes Corrine is she is a great problem-solver. She is a great problem-finder. A lot of people have a tendency to want to point a finger at somebody else whose fault it is or whose responsibility it should be. When Corrine sees an issue, she owns it.\u201d\n\nFor JPMorgan Chase, Burger\u2019s skills were essential as it dealt with the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The nation\u2019s largest banks were on the hot seat as customers were being turned out of homes they no longer could afford. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s mortgage business was front and center.\n\n\u201cAnd she came in to get right into the middle of that,\u201d Weinbach says. \u201cThe firm had issues where we had inappropriately foreclosed on military personnel. We had issues that had been going on for some time, but people weren\u2019t well aware of it. And Corrine got right in the middle of finding the issue and getting the right people together.\u201d\n\nBurger\u2019s technical skills in accounting carried JPMorgan Chase through the weekend of Sept. 25, 2008, when it agreed to buy the $310 billion-asset Washington Mutual for $1.9 billion, resolving the largest bank failure in U.S. history. WaMu had been placed into receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. \u201cCorrine was the person who needed to balance the books and figure out how to financially account for the sale properly, which was a very difficult thing to do in a very short time period,\u201d Weinbach says. \u201cI think the FDIC seized WaMu on Friday and then on Monday we needed to know how we were going to balance the books.\u201d\n\nConsent orders from the Federal Reserve, lawsuits by state attorneys general, major private securities litigation settlements and more\u2014\u201cnone of those was unique to JPMorgan Chase,\u201d he says. \u201cThese were industry issues. That\u2019s true for every single large player in the mortgage industry. And you know Corrine literally sat in the center of all of that, making sure we got to the other side of it, which is where we are now.\u201d\n\nThe McCoy Center at Polaris is the nation\u2019s largest single-tenant office building after the Pentagon. At 2 million square feet, it can feel like an impersonal maze of hallways inside a nondescript compound sitting in a sea of parked cars. Four years ago when she was named location leader for Columbus, Burger began a mission to improve employee engagement at the center. \u201cIf you look at this building, it\u2019s a massive building to try to get people to feel part of,\u201d Burger says.\n\nTo that end, the complex is amid a $200 million renovation plan. Part of that is creating enticing community spaces, such as the new conference center or forthcoming patios, Burger says. About 12,000 employees participate in business resource groups, which bring together people from disparate places in the organization to bond through commonalities. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to bring people out of their desks into interacting with the rest of the organization,\u201d Burger says. Volunteerism is another way Burger is engaging the workforce. JPMorgan Chase Columbus employees logged 34,000 volunteer hours last year, she says, double the number five years ago.\n\nMore than half of the employees at the McCoy Center are millennials, and the bank is increasingly being seen as a desirable place to work by young people from outside Ohio. When Burger first began working with the 250 or so interns JPMorgan Chase has annually in Columbus, 90 percent were from Ohio. Now, she says 30 percent to 40 percent come from outside Ohio. The shift is happening regionally as well, with Columbus attracting more relocating millennials than any other Midwest city, according to the Brookings Institution.\n\nAlternative transportation is on the minds of many younger workers, and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Columbus operations had 100 daily riders using Ford\u2019s Chariot microtransit service before the San Francisco-based Chariot ceased operations in February. The experiment started with the \u201c1,000 Car Club,\u201d Burger says, which was an aspirational sort of exercise involving \u201cWhat would it take to remove 1,000 cars from our parking lot?\u201d\n\nThe availability of commute options has benefits beyond recruiting skilled workers. Persuading more people to carpool would solve a logistical issue: The McCoy Center has 10,500 people working in it and only 8,800 parking spaces. Chase is exploring other ideas, such as an app to connect commuters who could ride in together. It also is pursuing partnerships that could involve a Chariot-like service: \u201cWe\u2019ve met with everyone,\u201d Burger says, including Columbus-based Share and the Central Ohio Transit Authority.\n\nCorrine Burger as a Columbus Region Leader\n\nA major pillar in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s talent strategy is a national focus on diversity and inclusion, Burger says. That underscored a $2.5 million investment the company made last year to support Ohio State scholarships for diverse students.\n\n\u201cWithout the right skills and meaningful education, many young people entering the labor market find themselves stuck in low-skill, low-wage jobs or, worse, unemployed and out of school,\u201d JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a November column in the Columbus Dispatch. \u201cBut only half of high school graduates who go on to four-year colleges end up completing a bachelor\u2019s degree within six years. Young people of color and those who come from low-income families fare even worse. Universities must do more to support students of all backgrounds who arrive on their campuses. Looking to the successes of central Ohio, one reason JPMorgan Chase has been able to increase our hiring here is the steady stream of talented women and men graduating from local colleges and universities.\u201d\n\nThe idea is for those diverse graduates to work for Chase, Burger says. That symbiosis also is playing out at Columbus State Community College, where Burger sits on the board of trustees and where JPMorgan Chase invested $2.5 million in 2014. Dimon says the bank has hired 630 Columbus State students since then.\n\nWorkforce development is center stage for the region\u2019s largest private employer and for organizations supporting economic development here including Columbus 2020, another of Burger\u2019s board positions. As machine learning and artificial intelligence advance to the point of changing the way people do their jobs and indeed what jobs they do at all, organizations including Chase are identifying the necessary skill sets of the future. Problem-solving, math and science skills and critical thinking all are crucial for the workforce of tomorrow.\n\nThe market for engineering students coming out of Ohio schools is tight, Burger says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably going to continue to get tighter. You certainly see it from the Columbus 2020 metrics as well. When new companies are coming in, they\u2019re looking at the local labor force. And of course, they see JPMorgan Chase, and we have a large tech presence. We try to attract people to migrate into Columbus, which is always interesting. It\u2019s hard to convince people to come here, but once you get them to come here they don\u2019t want to leave because it\u2019s such a fabulous place to live.\u201d\n\nColumbus is regarded as a tech hub for the bank, with 5,500 technology jobs among its roughly 20,000 total, Burger says. \u201cWell over 10 percent of our global network of technologists are here in this market, so I\u2019d say Columbus is an innovation site,\u201d she says. The innovation lab for Chase\u2019s branch network is in north Columbus, where ATM functionality is invented and tested. In Westerville, about 50 JPMorgan Chase technologists have taken up residence in a new fintech hub at The Point at Otterbein University, a STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) education center. The fintech hub is a collaboration among the city of Westerville, Chase and Otterbein to encourage financial technology research and development including ATMs, credit cards, blockchain, AI, machine learning and cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cWhat JPMorgan Chase is doing here helps not only to solidify their presence and their future aspirations within our community, but it also helps to fulfill our vision for The Point,\u201d says City Manager Dave Collinsworth of Westerville, where the bank is the largest employer with about 5,000 workers. \u201cI think Corrine really saw that early on: [The power of] pairing industry, higher education and local government together.\u201d\n\nAt Columbus State, Burger brings great strategic capacity to the board of trustees and \u201chas been just a tremendous add in terms of her direct understanding of workforce needs and not just where Chase is going, but where the business world is going,\u201d says David Harrison, the college\u2019s president. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s New Skills at Work program has been put into place under Burger\u2019s leadership and directly supports a regional initiative called the Central Ohio Compact, which has the goal of having 65 percent of adults hold a postsecondary degree by 2025. \u201cA big part of the Chase work has been focused on our relationships with K-12 and their investment has really created an infrastructure that\u2019s allowed us to expand that work dramatically,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cWe\u2019re now in the process of extending that same partnership model to employers.\u201d For example, in January JPMorgan Chase began a program in conjunction with Columbus State that gives the bank\u2019s operations employees certification in baseline technology skills such as web development and Java proficiency.\n\nConnecting the region\u2019s public leaders in education, government and nonprofits with the expertise in private industry is crucial for central Ohio to thrive, says Kenny McDonald, CEO of Columbus 2020. \u201d[Burger is] unbelievably connected,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cShe gives us great insight into how the bank and its operations are thinking about the world. That helps us not only understand Chase but what their clients are thinking about globally and how we need to evolve as a region to meet their needs locally.\n\n\u201cShe wants Columbus to be a talent magnet and a place that gets the credit it deserves for being a highly sophisticated, growing area,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cShe is a staunch Columbus advocate and we love her for that.\u201d\n\nKaty Smith was the editor of Columbus CEO from 2019 to 2022.",

Following the announcement, JPM stock rose 1.7% in yesterday\u2019s trading session. Chief Operating Officer Jennifer Piepszak highlighted that robust pipelines and sustained deal flow are key contributors to this expected growth.\n\nIn addition to the positive outlook for investment banking, JPMorgan reports that trading revenues have risen by low double digits year-over-year in the same period. This uptick reflects increased market activity and client engagement across various trading platforms.\n\nThese projections follow JPMorgan\u2019s solid fourth-quarter performance. The bank reported a 20% year-over-year increase in fixed-income trading revenue, reaching $5 billion. Additionally, investment banking fees surged 49% compared to the prior year, reflecting higher fees across all products.\n\nPayments Business Expands as Commercial Lending Slows\n\nBeyond traditional banking services, JPMorgan continues to expand its payments processing business, which currently handles nearly $10 trillion daily.\n\nThis strategy focuses on meeting the rising demand for fast and secure payments in the changing financial world.\n\nEconomic Uncertainty Slows Business Loan Demand\n\nWhile the bank\u2019s outlook remains optimistic, Piepszak acknowledges that some clients are exercising caution due to uncertainties surrounding new economic and regulatory policies. This uncertainty has slowed commercial loan demand because businesses are waiting for a clearer direction before making big financial decisions.\n\nIs JPM Stock a Good Buy Now?\n\nAnalysts remain cautiously optimistic about JPM stock, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys and seven Holds. Over the past year, JPM has surged by more than 57%, and the average JPM price target of $275.60 implies an upside potential of 0.22% from current levels.\n\nSee more JPM analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\u201cJPMorgan \u2026 they are going to end up being a target for us,\u201d Starbuck, a former video music director with roughly 800,000 followers on X, told Yahoo Finance over the weekend.\n\nStarbuck, 36, slammed the nation\u2019s largest bank for its gender identity training courses, calling it \u201cembarrassing\u201d and \u201cludicrous,\u201d and claimed the company uses illegal quotas to hire apprentices and analysts.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, if you see the evidence that this is not making you money, or this is wasting you money, then you should get away from it,\u201d Starbuck said.\n\nHis comments came after President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 21 in which he called on the Attorney General to identify private sector companies with \u201cegregious and discriminatory\u201d DEI programs.\n\n4 Trump signed an executive order last month calling on the Attorney General to identify private sector companies with \u201cegregious and discriminatory\u201d DEI programs. POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nA JPMorgan spokesperson defended the company\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cWe engage all communities to find the best talent and to bank the broadest range of customers, which is good for business,\u201d the rep told The Post on Monday.\n\nDimon recently dismissed criticism of DEI in an interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nSpeaking at the Alpine summit for global elites, the 68-year-old urged critics to \u201cbring them on\u201d when asked about possible fights over the policy with activist investors.\n\n4 JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon dismissed criticism of the bank\u2019s DEI policies in an interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. CNBC\n\n\u201cWe are going to continue to reach out to the black community and Hispanic community, LGBT community, and the veteran community,\u201d Dimon, who raked $39 million in 2024, said last month. \u201cWherever I go \u2014 red states, blue states \u2014 mayors, governors say they like what we do. So we\u2019re not trying to pander to any which side or any which thing.\n\nStarbuck claims to be responsible for encouraging some of America\u2019s biggest corporations to roll back DEI policies, including Walmart, Ford, Harley Davidson, and McDonald\u2019s.\n\n\u201cNo industry should feel safe,\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal in November. \u201cI will likely turn my sights to retailers who depend on the majority of Americans who just elected Trump with the popular vote.\u201d\n\nConservative groups such as the National Legal and Policy Center and the Heritage Foundation have also called upon America\u2019s biggest banks to review their approach to DEI.\n\n4 Starbuck led a vocal campaign against Walmart, the largest employer in the US, urging them to roll back DEI initiatives. Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nHeritage has also complained about accusations that some lenders are \u201cdebanking\u201d customers who hold right-wing beliefs.\n\nTrump, also speaking at Davos, singled out Bank of America and argued that \u201cthey don\u2019t take conservative business.\u201d\n\nThe commander-in-chief\u2019s claims were denied by a BoA spokesman.",

            "content": "With investors expecting a volatile market in 2025, many are turning to options strategies to help smooth the ride \u2014 and produce income. Stocks have bounced around this year, with tech names getting rattled by China's DeepSeek AI model and Trump administration trade policies causing uncertainty. Exchange-traded funds like the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) have been employing options strategies for years, but they are becoming increasingly popular. Morningstar calls these types of funds a \"hot corner\" of the ETF market. The derivative income ETF category raked in $33 billion in 2024 \u2014 bringing the total assets to $97 billion, the fund tracking firm said. That's up from $3 billion at the end of 2020, according to Morningstar. JEPI YTD mountain JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF one-year performance Hamilton Reiner, head of U.S. equity derivatives at JPMorgan Asset Management and manager of the Equity Premium fund, still expects the stock market to deliver low double-digit earnings growth this year across the board, not just in the Magnificent Seven. \"If you keep [price-to-earnings] multiples the same or if you have a slight reduction in multiples, we should probably see stocks up high single digits, low double digits,\" he said. He also anticipates a slightly higher level of volatility than last year, when the S & P 500 returned 23%. \"A strategy like this is going to seek to take advantage of that higher volatility by providing our investors two things \u2014 one, maybe a little more income, but also a little more upside,\" he said. Reiner's ETF has a 30-day SEC yield of 7.12%, as of Jan. 31, and an expense ratio of 0.35%. It had assets of $38.71 billion , as of Friday. The fund's mission is to balance income and total return, Reiner explained. When choosing stocks, the team focuses on those it believes are fundamentally attractive and have persistence of earnings. The team also makes sure there is diversification across all sectors and names, with no single stock allowed to account for more than 2% of the portfolio. The managers also sell out-of-the money options on the S & P 500 , so that investors still get some of the market's upside. \"We ladder and stagger our options, doing a portion of them each and every week, so our strategy is never, ever fully capped out,\" Reiner said. Investors get income in the form of the options premiums and any dividends on stocks within the fund. The dividends are a bonus and not the main driver of equity selection, he stressed. Reiner said the strategy is not meant to replace bonds or equities. \"You can complement those wonderful allocations by taking some of your stock, some of your bonds, and investing in a strategy like this, but maintaining that same risk profile,\" he said. The Equity Premium Income ETF can also be a home for part of investors' excess cash, he added. Some $6.92 trillion is currently sitting in money market funds, according to the Investment Company Institute . \"Cash is sort of like that silent killer,\" Reiner said. \"It feels good today, but when you start thinking about compounding wealth over the next 10, 20, 30 years, you are really going to be left on the sidelines.\"",

The oldest predecessor is The Bank Of The Manhattan Company which was founded in 1799 by Aaron Burr. At the time, The Bank Of The Manhattan Company was the 3rd oldest bank in the U.S. and the 31st oldest in the world. The Chase Manhattan Bank, a precursor to JPMorgan Chase, was later formed when The Bank Of Manhattan Company purchased Chase Bank which was established in 1877.\n\nJPMorgan & Co came to life in 1895 in order to finance the United States Steel Corporation. Itself a result of merger, the company also financed other early American businesses as well as aided the federal government by backing a bond offering. It wasn\u2019t until the year 2000 and after several more mergers that JPMorgan Chase & Co was born. It will be four more years before the merger with Bank One which is notable because it brings CEO Jamie Dimon into the picture.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co was instrumental in aiding the US government during the 2008 financial crisis. It backed the accounts of several major banks including Bear Stearns and eventually took over their operations. Today, JPMorgan Chase & Co operates as a financial services company worldwide with operations on every continent and in more than 60 countries.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co operates through four segments that are Consumer & Community Banking (CCB), Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB), Commercial Banking (CB), and Asset & Wealth Management (AWM).

Last month, Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan\u2019s president and chief operating officer, announced his retirement after 40 years with the bank. He is being replaced by Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of commercial and investment banking.\n\nIn other banking news, PYMNTS wrote last week about efforts by financial institutions (FIs) to recapture credit card \u201coutsiders,\u201d a group that includes \u201cSecond Chancers\u201d (people who once owned a credit card and are interested in doing so again) and the \u201cCredit Curious\u201d (people who\u2019ve never owned a credit card but are curious about obtaining one).\n\n\u201cCrucially for FIs is that contrary to the assumption that credit card outsiders avoid all credit products, 62% hold at least one type of credit account,\u201d that report said.\n\n\u201cStore cards and buy now, pay later (BNPL) plans are particularly prevalent, indicating a preference for accessible, short-term credit solutions over traditional loans. Notably, Second Chancers and the Credit Curious are more inclined to utilize these alternatives, suggesting their openness to credit products that offer flexibility and immediate utility.\u201d",

Yet you can make meaningful contributions in many ways\u2014volunteering your time, giving your financial resources and helping the nonprofit organizations working tirelessly to support those in need.\n\nHelping people who are in great peril is one of the most intrinsic forms of philanthropy. Your support might even have a transformative effect on relief and rebuilding efforts.\n\nBut donating can be difficult during a crisis. Information from the field can be inaccurate, and the number of charities asking for donations during and after a disaster can suddenly proliferate.\n\nTo help you give effectively in times like these, we offer these insights, including questions to help you with due diligence, considerations for the disaster\u2019s later phases, and ways to track your donations\u2019 impact.\n\nKnow the charity\n\nWhether you are looking to volunteer your time, financial resources or expertise, it\u2019s essential to choose established, registered charities with a proven track record in disaster management. Look for charities that have demonstrated success in prior crises and/or that are familiar with the area. When you\u2019re looking, you may find charities with needs that have emerged during the crisis that also align with your existing philanthropic goals.\n\nIf you find yourself drawn to new charities, ensure they have applied for 501(c)3 status or are using a registered fiscal sponsor. Evaluate the charity\u2019s leadership, reputation and capacity to manage funds and assess needs effectively.\n\nKey questions\n\nDoes the group have a deep understanding of the issues and problems it\u2019s addressing and strong ties to the communities being served?\n\nIs the organization led by skilled leaders who have a proven track record\u2014especially in times of crisis?\n\nDoes the organization have the capacity and resources to effectively deliver programs and services?\n\nDoes the organization collaborate with peers, and if it\u2019s been in existence for a while, does it maintain a good reputation with its funders?\n\nIs its financial management sound, with diverse revenue sources and a pattern of financial stability? You can verify this by reading its Form 990 (a tax-exempt nonprofit\u2019s tax return), publicly available from a variety of sources.\n\nAdapt your action and impact\n\nDisaster recovery is a complex process. It requires a strategic approach to addressing immediate needs\u2014emergency shelter and supplies, for example\u2014and to long-term needs as well, including reconstruction and ongoing mental health support. Philanthropy plays a crucial role in these multifaceted efforts.\n\nWhile disaster fundraising often declines after six months, the needs on the ground persist.\n\nKey considerations\n\nThink about the evolving situation as having several phases:\n\nPhase 1\u2014Urgent needs\n\n\n\nThe first focus is on a rapid response to provide essential services and critical supplies: emergency shelter, food and water, medical assistance, psychological support to individuals coping with trauma.\n\n\n\nWhile this has already occurred in Los Angeles, normally in an emergency, your first step should be to find out if distribution channels for emergency supplies have been established, and if charities and government departments are coordinated to ensure that the people with the greatest needs are reached first.\n\n\n\nRecognize that needs may vary from neighborhood to neighborhood, and news reports and social media may not be fully accurate on the state of the disaster region (resource deployment may seem slower than expected, for example, but perceptions may not reflect the reality on the ground).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first focus is on a rapid response to provide essential services and critical supplies: emergency shelter, food and water, medical assistance, psychological support to individuals coping with trauma.

Phase 2\u2014Recovery and rebuilding\n\n\n\nOnce the immediate crisis has been managed, efforts shift to restoring normalcy and beginning reconstruction. This involves debris removal, restoring homes, repairing infrastructure, and engaging the community to foster collaboration and ownership.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the immediate crisis has been managed, efforts shift to restoring normalcy and beginning reconstruction. This involves debris removal, restoring homes, repairing infrastructure, and engaging the community to foster collaboration and ownership. Phase3\u2014Building resilience and promoting sustainability\n\n\n\nThese actions can better prepare communities for future disasters. They include conducting disaster preparedness training and prevention, undertaking sustainable development projects and economic recovery programs, and advocating for policy change to reduce the community\u2019s vulnerability over the long term.\n\nMeasure your impact\n\nYou should certainly gain an understanding from the recipient organization of where the needs are greatest, but equally important is setting clear expectations for your contributions so that your donations will be used for the purposes you intend.\n\nKey tips\n\nIf reasonable, you might ask charities to provide periodic reports, on the target population\u2019s and organization\u2019s current needs, and how it\u2019s responding (although you wouldn\u2019t want to make inquiries that would divert scarce resources away from its ability to function during a crisis).\n\nIf you have contributed significant funds to an organization, consider conducting a site visit, if possible, or requesting a meeting with leadership three to six months after the donation, to learn more about how your donation is being used.\n\n\n\nLeverage our help and expertise\n\nAs we have come together to support Los Angeles and its surrounding communities, our collective efforts can help rebuild lives, restore hope and ensure a more resilient future for all.

            "content": "5 Mins Read\n\nDriven by climate-related disruptions, America\u2019s largest banks face financial risks of up to $9.3B from their investment in livestock agriculture.\n\nBy lending money to some of the world\u2019s biggest meat and dairy companies, US banks aren\u2019t just hurting the planet, but also their bottom lines.\n\nSince 2023, 58 American banks have provided at least $134B in loans and underwriting to animal protein and feed producers, and 55% of this sum ($74B) has come from just three institutions. Bank of America, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase are the largest US-based lenders for livestock farming, but the climate crisis they\u2019re exacerbating is putting their money at risk.\n\nNearly 90% of the outstanding financing provided by these \u2018Big Three\u2019 banks faces climate-related risks, while the 31 companies that benefit from this capital \u2013 including Nestl\u00e9, JBS, Tyson Foods, Fonterra, and Danone \u2013 themselves stand to lose up to $5.4T, according to a new report by Dutch research group Profundo.\n\nIt analysed financial data from 2016 to 2023 and used climate scenario modelling to calculate both near-term and long-term risks to both the banks and their beneficiaries, considering factors like deforestation impacts, greenhouse gas emissions, water scarcity, and supply chain risks due to weather volatility.\n\n\u201cThe analysis and the numbers are a wake-up call: continued investment in this unsustainable industry creates very high externalized climate damage costs as well as potential high cash costs,\u201d said Gerard Rijk, senior equity analyst at Profundo and a lead researcher for the study. \u201cThese hurt the planet as well as the portfolios of banks and asset managers.\u201d\n\nBig Three face up to $9.3B in long-term losses\n\nCourtesy: FromtheNorth/Ben Sutherland/Bloomberg/Patricia Enciso via Flickr/CC, Getty Images\n\nThe report suggests that in the near term (to 2030), the 31 corporations analysed could face $116B in losses, representing 44% of their gross debt. For the Big Three banks \u2013 whose outstanding financial exposure here is valued at $10.4B \u2013 this translates to a risk in the range of $430M to $1.1B.\n\nIn the long term, the numbers really rack up. The meat, dairy and feed producers face a risk in the range of $536B to $5.4T by 2050. These potential losses comprise 58% of their enterprise value at the lower end, and 581% at the higher end.\n\nThere are more factors that influence the long-term risks \u2013 in addition to higher feed costs and volume changes, livestock farming companies could also face carbon taxes, higher interest rates, declining consumer demand, and reputation loss.\n\nBank of America, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, are confronted with financial risks between $2.3B and $9.3B in the long term. But by ending financing as soon as loans are redeemed, the Big Three can reduce these risks by 83-95%.\n\n\u201cFinancial institutions must act swiftly to mitigate these risks by shifting capital toward more sustainable food systems,\u201d said Kelly McNamara, senior research and policy analyst at climate non-profit Friends of the Earth US, which supported the report.\n\n\u201cThe tools to redirect investments toward environmentally sustainable practices that benefit consumers, the climate and the global economy are already within our reach. The real question is: do major financial institutions have the will to use them?\u201d she added.\n\nHow banks can halt climate risks and emissions\n\nCourtesy: Erik McGregor\n\nThe study notes that Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) and committed to aligning their financed emissions with net-zero pathways. But while agriculture is among the high-emitting sectors for which NZBA signatories are required to set 2050 net-zero targets, no bank has taken this step.\n\n\u201cThe data is clear: climate risk is financial risk. By significantly curtailing or ending financing to a small number of high-emitting companies in the agricultural sector, the Big Three and any other lenders or investors in the sector can limit exposure to climate-related losses and make significant progress on their net-zero commitments,\u201d the report reads.\n\nThe Big Three\u2019s lending to these companies represents just 0.25% of their total outstanding loans, but roughly 11% of their reported financed emissions \u2013 so taking action on a tiny portion of their portfolios will have an outside impact on their path to net zero.\n\nThe report recommends these banks curtail and ultimately end financing that enables the expansion of livestock farming. To do so, they need to stop issuing new corporate or project-based financing or revolving credit facilities to meat, dairy or feed producers, and not renew existing loans or facilities either. The banks should also refrain from underwriting bonds or IPOs and halt new investments in their publicly traded securities.\n\nAccording to Profundo, banks should require clients to disclose 100% of their emissions across scopes 1, 2 and 3, set near- and long-term absolute reduction targets, and prioritise methane cuts with a pledge to decrease emissions by at least 30% by 2030 (from 2020 levels). These companies should also lower emissions by reducing the number of animals in their supply chains, and without relying on carbon credits or offsets.\n\nCourtesy: The Nature Conservancy\n\nBank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase were also among the banks that left the Equator Principles, a set of minimum standards and safeguards to identify and manage the potential ESG impacts of financing high-polluting projects, after political pressure last year.\n\nThat said, in November, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s head of nature and biodiversity, Gwen Yu, highlighted the importance of filing the $700B nature funding gap: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a significant increase in client demand for products that incorporate nature, so we\u2019re excited to be part of these global dialogues and share our expertise on how banks can help facilitate capital towards nature-related projects.\u201d",

Itself a result of merger, the company also financed other early American businesses as well as aided the federal government by backing a bond offering. It wasn\u2019t until the year 2000 and after several more mergers that JPMorgan Chase & Co was born. It will be four more years before the merger with Bank One which is notable because it brings CEO Jamie Dimon into the picture.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co was instrumental in aiding the US government during the 2008 financial crisis. It backed the accounts of several major banks including Bear Stearns and eventually took over their operations. Today, JPMorgan Chase & Co operates as a financial services company worldwide with operations on every continent and in more than 60 countries.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co operates through four segments that are Consumer & Community Banking (CCB), Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB), Commercial Banking (CB), and Asset & Wealth Management (AWM).

Morgan\u201d) have an actual or perceived economic or other incentive in its management of our clients\u2019 portfolios to act in a way that benefits J.P. Morgan. Conflicts will result, for example (to the extent the following activities are permitted in your account): (1) when J.P. Morgan invests in an investment product, such as a mutual fund, structured product, separately managed account or hedge fund issued or managed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or an affiliate, such as J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.; (2) when a J.P. Morgan entity obtains services, including trade execution and trade clearing, from an affiliate; (3) when J.P. Morgan receives payment as a result of purchasing an investment product for a client\u2019s account; or (4) when J.P. Morgan receives payment for providing services (including shareholder servicing, recordkeeping or custody) with respect to investment products purchased for a client\u2019s portfolio. Other conflicts will result because of relationships that J.P. Morgan has with other clients or when J.P. Morgan acts for its own account.\n\nInvestment strategies are selected from both J.P. Morgan and third-party asset managers and are subject to a review process by our manager research teams. From this pool of strategies, our portfolio construction teams select those strategies we believe fit our asset allocation goals and forward-looking views in order to meet the portfolio\u2019s investment objective.\n\nAs a general matter, we prefer J.P. Morgan managed strategies. We expect the proportion of J.P. Morgan managed strategies will be high (in fact, up to 100 percent) in strategies such as, for example, cash and high-quality fixed income, subject to applicable law and any account-specific considerations.\n\nWhile our internally managed strategies generally align well with our forward-looking views, and we are familiar with the investment processes as well as the risk and compliance philosophy of the firm, it is important to note that J.P. Morgan receives more overall fees when internally managed strategies are included. We offer the option of choosing to exclude J.P. Morgan managed strategies (other than cash and liquidity products) in certain portfolios.\n\nThe Six Circles Funds are U.S.-registered mutual funds managed by J.P. Morgan and sub-advised by third parties. Although considered internally managed strategies, JPMC does not retain a fee for fund management or other fund services.\n\nLEGAL ENTITY, BRAND & REGULATORY INFORMATION\n\nIn the United States, bank deposit accounts and related services, such as checking, savings and bank lending, are offered by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

About 200 of JPMorgan's largest clients attended, according to the source, who declined to be identified discussing a private client event.\n\nMusk took the stage with his mother, Maye Musk, for a conversation moderated by David Rubenstein, co-founder of private equity firm the Carlyle Group.\n\nThe conversation covered a wide range of topics, including the scope of work of the Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Musk.\n\nDOGE has goals of eliminating entire federal agencies and cutting three quarters of federal government jobs.\n\nJPMorgan declined to comment, while Musk and Carlyle did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.\n\nDimon and Musk, once adversaries in a prolonged legal battle, have settled their differences, the prominent Wall Street banker said in an interview last month.\n\nThe biggest U.S. lender had sued Tesla in 2021, kicking off a drawn-out dispute that was at least in part tied to Musk's 2018 tweet where he said he had \"funding secured\" to take the EV giant private, only to abandon that plan a few weeks later.\n\nTesla countersued the bank in 2023, but both the companies dropped their claims against each other in November.\n\n(Reporting by Nupur Anand in New York, Editing by Marguerita Choy and Chris Reese)",

But JPMorgan Chase says the AI chipmaker is bound to benefit from the Chinese startup.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based artificial intelligence startup sent shockwaves through both Silicon Valley and Wall Street last month after raising questions about Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure.\n\nBut despite the AI-driven stock rally losing $1 trillion in value, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research analysts said in a new report that DeepSeek will likely have a positive impact on companies such as Amazon, Meta, and Google parent Alphabet, as well as chipmaking leader Nvidia.\n\nThe Chinese startup launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models in January that performed on par with similar models from OpenAI and Anthropic, while its open-source DeepSeek-V3 model released in December also performed competitively with AI models from the U.S.-based companies \u2014 for far less money and less advanced chips.\n\nAccording to the V3 technical paper, the model cost $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s reduced-capability H800 chips. U.S. firms, meanwhile, are spending billions on tens of thousands of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful H100 chips, which are not allowed to be sold to China under U.S. export controls.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to \u201cstrong demand\u201d for higher performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, JPMorgan analysts said Wednesday. \u201cTherefore, Nvidia\u2019s leadership in advanced AI chips \u201cshould enable them to unlock new use-cases.\u201d Other chip firms such as Broadcom, Marvell, and Micron are also likely to benefit from DeepSeek, according to JPMorgan.\n\nChip pioneer Intel, however, stands to lose out from DeepSeek, analysts said, because demand for its central processing units, or CPUs, will decrease as amid the shift to accelerated computing.\n\nJPMorgan analysts also said they \u201cbelieve the broader Internet ecosystem should benefit\u201d following the open-source AI model advancements demonstrated by DeepSeek and China\u2019s Alibaba. The improved cost efficiency \u201cshould accelerate\u201d AI development and adoption, leading to more consumption, the analysts said, adding that they \u201cexpect heavy capital expenditures investment\u201d by Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta to continue in the medium term.\n\nMeta is expected to benefit from increased open-source model adoption as it builds its next-generation open-source Llama 4 model, JPMorgan said. During the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough shows the need for a global open-source standard led by the U.S.\n\nAmazon, which introduced DeepSeek-R1 in its cloud platforms, will likely benefit from providing more open-source AI model options, analysts said, because it will increase AI demand and usage, driving monetization.\n\nMeanwhile Alphabet is also likely to benefit from the lower training and inferencing costs demonstrated by DeepSeek, JPMorgan said, because it will be able to accelerate development and adoption of AI agents, as well as other AI applications such as Google\u2019s NotebookLM and Gemini Advanced with Deep Research.\n\nGoogle on Wednesday made its \u201cmost capable\u201d AI model, Gemini 2.0, available to everyone. At its unveiling in December, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said Gemini 2.0 \u201cwill enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.\u201ds.\n\nSource: QZ\n\nSee more: GSMA to name permanent new chair after MWC25\n\nSee more: Moove acquires Kovi\n\nSee more: Telef\u00f3nica Tech and IBM sign a collaboration agreement for quantum-safe technology",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 10 High Growth Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against the other stocks.\n\nKen Fisher is the founder and executive chairman of Fisher Asset Management, a renowned investment and financial analysis expert. He established the firm in 1979 and now has $299 billion in assets under management. Over the years, he has built a legacy of innovative investment strategies, a contrarian approach, and a focus on long-term growth.\n\nInvestment Philosophy and Strategies of Fisher:\n\nCompared with many other firms, Fisher Investments' most distinctive aspects are its methodical approach to portfolio management and its reliance on research. In his 1984 book Super Stocks, he popularized the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio to find undervalued growth stocks. The ratio continues to play a key role in his firm\u2019s stock selection process, helping to uncover companies with strong growth prospects that might be hidden from the broader market.\n\nFisher\u2019s contrarian mentality distinguishes him from most investors. He advises questioning mainstream market sentiments and looking for opportunities others might miss. His book The Only Three Questions That Count examines this more in-depth, explaining how good investors must constantly challenge their view of the world, find insights no one else sees, and combat mental biases to find the right investment opportunity.\n\nDiversified Portfolio and Sector Emphasis:\n\nThe firm\u2019s holdings express Fisher\u2019s long-held maxim that diversification helps reduce risk. Technology is a particularly strong-performing sector, accounting for 31.8% of the portfolio as of Q3 2024, displaying Fisher\u2019s faith in the enduring rise of tech stocks. The portfolio is also heavy in other sectors, such as services (14.6%), financial services (12.3%), and healthcare (10.5%).\n\nIn 2024, Fisher Investments achieved an incredible 32.18% return, fueled mainly by its tech positions, especially in companies that benefited from the artificial intelligence boom. While many investors have become cautious about frothy tech valuations, Fisher\u2019s firm has remained steadfast, doubling down on AI chipmakers and other tech innovators.\n\nRecent Developments:\n\nIn January 2025, Fisher Investments finalized the sale of a minority stake valued at nearly $3 billion to Advent International and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, valuing the firm at approximately $13 billion. The decision is a strategic move that has been a part of Ken Fisher's long-term estate planning, allowing the firm to continue its private independence and never-ending commitment to outstanding client service. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best high growth stocks in Ken Fisher's portfolio.",

            "content": "A new survey from JPMorgan has unveiled a significant shift in the institutional trading landscape, with nearly one in three institutional traders indicating plans to engage with cryptocurrency in 2025. This marks a substantial increase from last year, highlighting growing institutional interest in digital assets as part of broader financial strategies.\n\n29% of Institutional Traders to Engage in Crypto This Year\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s annual e-Trading Edit survey, which queried over 4,200 traders from more than 60 countries, reveals that 29% of institutional traders will either be actively trading cryptocurrencies or plan to do so in 2025. This figure represents a notable rise from 21% in 2024, underscoring the increasing momentum behind cryptocurrency adoption within traditional financial institutions.\n\nSpecifically, the survey found that 13% of respondents are already trading crypto, while 16% plan to begin trading in the coming year. Both of these figures have increased compared to 2024, where only 9% were trading and 12% intended to do so.\n\nCrypto Moving from Speculation to Strategic Asset\n\nThe growth in institutional interest is being seen as more than just a trend or speculative phase. According to Sidney Powell, co-founder and CEO of Maple Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lender, the rise in crypto trading among institutional traders signifies a deeper shift. Powell notes that institutional sentiment has evolved from mere curiosity to an active strategy, with firms integrating cryptocurrency into their operational frameworks.\n\n\u201cFrom our vantage point, institutional sentiment has shifted from curiosity to strategy. Firms aren\u2019t just exploring crypto; they\u2019re actively finding ways to integrate it into their operations,\u201d said Powell. This shift reflects the broader trend of digital assets evolving from niche, high-risk investments to accepted, integrated components of diversified portfolios for institutional investors.\n\nClearer Regulatory Frameworks Driving Crypto Adoption\n\nThe growing acceptance of crypto as an asset class is also due to clearer regulatory frameworks being implemented in various jurisdictions. While regulatory uncertainty has plagued the U.S. market, Powell points out that many countries are moving toward more structured approaches to digital asset regulation.\n\nThe Trump administration and U.S. Congress have stated their intent to create a stable coin bill and broader regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, which many believe will further boost institutional confidence in the space.\n\nDigital Channels Dominate Crypto Trading\n\nAs more institutional traders turn to cryptocurrency, digital trading platforms remain the primary medium for executing crypto transactions. The survey found that 71% of institutional traders expect their trading activities to be conducted through e-trading channels this year, with this figure projected to rise to 80% by 2026. This growth suggests that digital assets are increasingly treated on par with other traditional financial products, such as equities, commodities, and foreign exchange.\n\nThis shift toward digital channels reflects the growing mainstream acceptance of crypto, making it easier for institutions to trade and manage digital assets as part of their broader financial strategies.\n\nAI and Blockchain Technologies: Key Influences on Trading\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies are gaining traction, artificial intelligence (AI) continues to dominate as the most influential technology in institutional trading. Two-thirds of survey participants cited AI and machine learning as the leading technologies driving their trading activities, up from 53% in 2023.\n\nIn contrast, blockchain and digital ledger technology saw a decline in influence, with only 6% of respondents naming it the most influential technology in 2025, down from 12% the previous year. This shift reflects a growing focus on the practical applications of AI, while the foundational blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies, though still important, may be seen as less immediately impactful for trading operations.\n\nThe Path Ahead for Crypto in Institutional Portfolios\n\nThe JPMorgan survey highlights a growing trend of crypto adoption among institutional traders, signaling a shift toward integrating digital assets as part of diversified investment portfolios. This adoption is not just driven by speculation but by the recognition of cryptocurrency\u2019s potential as a legitimate and stable asset class.\n\nAs more institutions explore ways to include crypto in their operations, the regulatory landscape will play a key role in shaping how the market develops. With clearer guidelines and growing mainstream acceptance, cryptocurrencies are poised to become a central component of institutional investment strategies in the coming years.\n\nThe increased institutional interest is also likely to have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. As more capital flows into the space, volatility may decrease, and market stability could improve, attracting even more institutional investors looking for reliable, long-term growth potential in digital assets.",

The blockchain ecosystem is constantly evolving, and new solutions offer more efficient and scalable alternatives.\n\nThis scenario puts pressure on Ethereum, which must face crucial challenges to maintain its dominant position.\n\nJPMorgan: la crescente concorrenza frena Ethereum\n\nIn recent years, several blockchain networks have gained ground, offering faster and cheaper solutions compared to Ethereum.\n\nSolana, Avalanche e Binance Smart Chain are among the platforms that have attracted developers and users thanks to lower fees and reduced transaction times.\n\nEthereum, despite being the first to introduce smart contracts, still suffers from scalability issues. The transition to Ethereum 2.0 and Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism have improved some aspects, but the competition has not stopped.\n\nNew blockchains with innovative consensus mechanisms continue to gain market share.\n\nJPMorgan has highlighted how the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem has slowed down due to competition. Although the network continues to dominate the DeFi and NFT sectors, its dominance is no longer absolute.\n\nRecent data shows that Ethereum\u2019s market share in DeFi trading volumes has fallen below 60%, while other blockchains are attracting liquidity and users.\n\nThis drop in dominance might explain why ETH is unable to register a significant price increase, despite the cryptocurrency market showing signs of recovery.\n\nOne of the main problems of Ethereum remains the high cost of transactions. During periods of high congestion, the gas fees can reach prohibitive levels, making the network less attractive for retail users and developers.\n\nThe Layer-2 solutions are trying to alleviate the problem, but the success of competing networks shows that many users prefer native alternatives with integrated scalability.\n\nThis scenario creates an increasingly competitive environment, in which Ethereum must accelerate its technological developments to avoid losing further ground.\n\nDoes the market reflect uncertainty?\n\nThe price of ETH has shown a lack of momentum compared to other cryptocurrencies. Although Ethereum remains a fundamental asset for the blockchain ecosystem, investors seem to be waiting for more concrete progress before betting on significant growth.\n\nThe market sentiment reflects a cautious wait: on one hand, Ethereum maintains a dominant position, on the other, the competition is reducing its lead.\n\nThe lack of a clear catalyst could explain the stagnation of the price of ETH in a market that instead has seen other altcoins register more consistent gains.\n\nIn other words, Ethereum is in a crucial phase of its evolution. The competition with emerging blockchains is putting pressure on its dominance and is influencing the performance of ETH on the market.\n\nTo maintain its position, Ethereum will need to address the challenges related to scalability and costs, ensuring that its ecosystem remains the most attractive for developers and users.\n\n\n\nContinuous innovation will be the key to the future of Ethereum. Will the network overcome the competition and regain its momentum in the cryptocurrency market? Time and technological developments will provide the answer.",

When employees register for a conference room, their temperature preferences will be included, and employee coffee preferences will be tracked.\n\nAdvanced tech isn\u2019t the only perk. Much like a hotel, the new building will feature a \u201csignature scent.\u201d The company\u2019s large corporate art collection (featuring gifts from David Rockefeller) will also be on display, as well as generative artwork that comes to life and moves when guests walk past.\n\ndbox/Foster + Partners\n\nThe firm also created a 19-restaurant food court for employees, which Arena says is \u201clike the modern version of an Eataly.\u201d Food can be delivered on-demand straight to employees\u2019 desks. After work, they can take advantage of an Irish pub also located in the building, as well as physical therapy, yoga or meditation classes.\n\n\u201cThat's the job of our group in real estate: Take the friction out of your day and make your day easier,\u201d David Arena, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s head of global real estate, told me when we recently sat down for a video interview. \u201cWhy shouldn't your day be great? Why shouldn't coming to work be great? Why shouldn't it be better than being at home? And we kind of love that.\u201d\n\nThe first group of around 2,000 employees are scheduled to transition to the building in August.

Constituents are selected based on company market capitalization and weighted by free float market capitalization.\n\nThe Russell 3000 Index is a capitalization-weighted stock market index that seeks to be a benchmark of the entire U.S. stock market. It measures the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. companies representing approximately 96% of the investable U.S. equity market.\n\nThe S&P 500 Equal Weight Index is the equal-weight version of the widely-used S&P 500. The index includes the same constituents as the capitalization weighted S&P 500, but each company in the S&P 500 EWI is allocated a fixed weight of the index total at each quarterly rebalance.\n\nThe Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is a broad-based flagship benchmark that measures the investment grade, US dollar-denominated, fixed-rate taxable bond market. The index includes Treasuries, government-related and corporate securities, MBS (agency fixed-rate pass-throughs), ABS and CMBS (agency and non-agency).\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are a group of influential companies in the U.S. stock market: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla.\n\nThe Magnificent 7 Index is an equal-dollar weighted equity benchmark consisting of a fixed basket of 7 widely-traded companies (Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla) classified in the United States and representing the Communications, Consumer Discretionary and Technology sectors as defined by Bloomberg Industry Classification System (BICS).\n\nThe S&P Midcap 400 Index is a capitalization-weighted index which measures the performance of the mid-range sector of the U.S. stock market.\n\nThe S&P 500 index is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities and serves as the foundation for a wide range of investment products. The index includes 500 leading companies and captures approximately 80% coverage of available market capitalization.\n\nBonds are subject to interest rate risk, credit, call, liquidity and default risk of the issuer. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.\n\nStandard and Poor\u2019s 500 Index is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks. The index is designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries. The index was developed with a base level of 10 for the 1941\u201343 base period.\n\nThe Bloomberg Eco Surprise Index shows the degree to which economic analysts under- or over-estimate the trends in the business cycle. The surprise element is defined as the percentage difference between analyst forecasts and the published value of economic data releases.\n\nThe MSCI World Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure global developed market equity performance.\n\nThe NASDAQ 100 Index is a basket of the 100 largest, most actively traded U.S companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.

But JPMorgan (JPM) Chase says the AI chipmaker is bound to benefit from the Chinese startup.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based artificial intelligence startup sent shockwaves through both Silicon Valley and Wall Street last month after raising questions about Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure.\n\nBut despite the AI-driven stock rally losing $1 trillion in value, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research analysts said in a new report that DeepSeek will likely have a positive impact on companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Google (GOOGL) parent Alphabet, as well as chipmaking leader Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nThe Chinese startup launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models in January that performed on par with similar models from OpenAI and Anthropic, while its open-source DeepSeek-V3 model released in December also performed competitively with AI models from the U.S.-based companies \u2014 for far less money and less advanced chips.\n\nAccording to the V3 technical paper, the model cost $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s reduced-capability H800 chips. U.S. firms, meanwhile, are spending billions on tens of thousands of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful H100 chips, which are not allowed to be sold to China under U.S. export controls.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to \u201cstrong demand\u201d for higher performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, JPMorgan analysts said Wednesday. \u201cTherefore, Nvidia\u2019s leadership in advanced AI chips \u201cshould enable them to unlock new use-cases.\u201d Other chip firms such as Broadcom (AVGO), Marvell (MRVL), and Micron (MU) are also likely to benefit from DeepSeek, according to JPMorgan.\n\nChip pioneer Intel (INTC), however, stands to lose out from DeepSeek, analysts said, because demand for its central processing units, or CPUs, will decrease as amid the shift to accelerated computing.\n\nJPMorgan analysts also said they \u201cbelieve the broader Internet ecosystem should benefit\u201d following the open-source AI model advancements demonstrated by DeepSeek and China\u2019s Alibaba (BABA). The improved cost efficiency \u201cshould accelerate\u201d AI development and adoption, leading to more consumption, the analysts said, adding that they \u201cexpect heavy capital expenditures investment\u201d by Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta to continue in the medium term.\n\nMeta is expected to benefit from increased open-source model adoption as it builds its next-generation open-source Llama 4 model, JPMorgan said. During the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough shows the need for a global open-source standard led by the U.S.",

And what does it mean to you?\n\nSo, I brought this [holding up her item \u2013 blue, glinting in the light], which is a Chase pin. It was given to me by my former Market Director of Banking at a quarterly meeting he was hosting to kick the year off. I had just been on leave for four months, and this was my first day back at work. As soon as I walked into the room, he gave it to me, and it was so meaningful for several reasons.\n\nAt the time, I wasn't sure if I wanted to stay here. When I was on leave, I started questioning myself. Like, do I even belong there? I didn\u2019t know if it was the right fit. But for my Market Director to have the foresight to give me a gift as soon as I walked into the room made me feel like \u2013 well of course I belong here! It was such a simple gesture for him. But to me, it meant the world.\n\nAnother reason I carry this pin around is because of what else happened that day. My Market Director played a video from the recent National Achievers Conference \u2013 and it actually featured Abe, who\u2019s also here at this shoot today. And my Market Director came up to me at the end of the meeting and he said, \u201cSophie, that guy reminds me of you. The way you carry yourself, the way you speak \u2013 he reminds me of you.\u201d And don't forget \u2013 at this point in time, I was wondering: Do I belong here? And now I'm hearing that not only do I belong here, but that I seem to have some similar characteristics as these people that are doing really, really well.\n\nAnd I thought, you know what? It's okay. It's okay to be Sophie. Sophie kind of rocks. So, I carry this pin because of that. Because it reminds me that I do belong here. And that my Chase family really is the wind beneath my wings. And that I\u2019m not doing the company any good by pretending that I'm not good in the areas that I'm good at.\n\nThat\u2019s amazing! It\u2019s wonderful to hear about coworkers and leaders being so supportive. Switching gears a little bit, what would you say is one of the best pieces of financial advice you've ever been given?\n\nI don't know that I've ever been given financial advice that was impactful as much as what I saw. I was born in Kenya, and grew up there, and came to America for college. Growing up, I was in boarding schools my whole life, but when I\u2019d come home on holiday, my parents were really big on allowing me to travel worldwide. My parents were strict, with their default answer being \"no\" to what felt like everything. But they\u2019d never say no to giving me an allowance when traveling. The night before a trip I\u2019d make a case for however much I wanted for my allowance. And dad's answer was always \"yes\" as long as I accounted for every single penny when I returned.\n\nI think for me, that practice of accounting for every single penny taught me everything I needed to know about finance. I mean, I was the only kid I knew at eight, nine, ten years old on the side of the road, buying ice cream, and pocketing the receipt for it. I took the responsibility seriously! I got good at planning out what I wanted to buy in advance and I\u2019d bring my dad home every bit of change with receipts to show what was spent. It was an excellent way to learn about budgeting, the act of conscious spending, and even foreign currency as some of my travel was international.",

The first group of around 2,000 employees are scheduled to transition to the building in August.The building\u2019s lighting system is tailored to sync with a worker's natural body rhythm (circadian rhythm), adjusting its brightness, colour, and pulse throughout the day to energize employees.When employees register for a conference room, their temperature preferences will be included, and employee coffee preferences will be tracked, reported Fortune.But it\u2019s not just about technology. JPMorgan has also gone all out to make the space feel like a hotel. The building will feature a signature scent, a rotating art collection (including gifts from David Rockefeller), and even generative art that moves as people walk by, making the office feel dynamic and creative.The organization also partnered with New York restaurateur Danny Meyer to design and build a food court of 19 restaurants for employees. According to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s head of global real estate David Arena, the food court is expected to be \u201clike the modern version of an Eataly.\u201d According to the report, food can be delivered on-demand straight to employees\u2019 desks.Employees will also have access to an Irish pub, which is located in the building, along with physical therapy, yoga or meditation classes.According to Arena real estate helps to take the friction out of one's day and make the day easier. Arena said \u201cWhy shouldn't your day be great? Why shouldn't coming to work be great? Why shouldn't it be better than being at home? And we kind of love that,\u201d as quoted by Fortune.Employees will have access to physical therapy, yoga, and meditation classes after work, along with an Irish pub for relaxation and socializing. The goal is to create a balanced, enjoyable environment for all employees.Yes, when registering for a conference room, employees can set their own temperature preferences to create a more personalized and comfortable workspace.",

            "content": "Traders are bracing for the release of January's jobs report on Friday, which could inject some more volatility into an already jittery market. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to report a gain of 169,000 jobs for last month. The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 4.1%. The latest employment data comes as investors grapple with global trade concerns, which could postpone rate cuts from the Federal Reserve if tariffs on imports from countries such as China, Mexico and Canada translate into an uptick in inflation. Against this backdrop, traders at JPMorgan broke down how they expect the market to react to the report, depending on how many jobs are added. Here are the five scenarios: More than 230,000 jobs added (5% chance): The S & P 500 would fall between 0.5% and 1% under this scenario. \"This is the type of print that would be worrisome to the Fed and the bond market, and the reaction would likely remove the 2x rate cuts currently priced into the market; and, depending on the strength of the print, could increase bets that the Fed would have to hike at some point this year as the economy would be poised to accelerate well beyond 3% real GDP growth,\" the traders said. Between 190,000 and 230,000 jobs added (25% chance): The S & P 500 would gain between 0.25% and 1.25% under this outcome, according to JPMorgan. Traders said that, \"given the growth fears induced by Trade War 2.0, this would assuage some of those concerns and give investors a higher base, of economic growth, to consider the potential impact.\" Between 150,000 and 190,000 jobs added (40% chance): \"The second best outcome for bulls despite this range including a cooler than expected print, which would still show enough job growth to keep the U.S. growing at least at trend-levels,\" the traders said. The S & P 500 would gain between 0.25% and 0.75%. Between 110,000 and 150,000 jobs added (25% chance): This outcome would put pressure on stocks, sending the S & P 500 down 0.5% to 1.25%. \"The risk here is that the labor market is cooling faster than anticipated and that will take spending with it,\" JPMorgan traders said. Less than 110,000 jobs added (5% chance): The S & P 500 would lose between 1.25% and 1.5%, per JPMorgan. \"Adverse weather aside, this type of print would suggest that the uncertainty surrounding global trade is filtering into the real (U.S.) economy more quickly than expected,\" the traders said.",

            "content": "JPMorgan Chase expects to triple its branch network in Alabama over the next five years, continuing a yearslong strategy to build its physical footprint.\n\nThe plan calls for opening 24 new branches across Alabama by 2030, and hiring more than 170 people to staff them. The country's largest bank by assets has grown its Alabama branch count from one to 11 in the last five years.\n\nThe \"quick\" growth in the region has been boosted by Chase's nationwide scale, said Jennifer DiSalvo, who has led the bank's branch expansion in the state for the past three years.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many people come in that have moved [from other parts of the country] that are like, 'We've been waiting for you to be here for 10 years,'\" DiSalvo said. \"We already have such a footprint, as far as customers that have credit cards with us or that banked with us \u2026 we've had a great response to being in Alabama from those clients, and word has really spread.\"\n\nDiSalvo, an Alabama native, said the new locations will be staffed locally, and will complement the bank's technology solutions, which consumers can also tap into.\n\nThe bank currently operates in Birmingham, the Huntsville area, Tuscaloosa and Auburn, with plans to add a few branches in those locations, plus expand into towns like Montgomery, Muscle Shoals and Decatur.\n\nThe bank is also looking to grow its commercial and small-business lines in Alabama, hoping to add more relationship managers in some cities.\n\n\"Alabama is a vibrant state with a strong manufacturing economy, good small-business growth, and burgeoning aerospace and technology sectors. Our mission is to support economic growth and foster opportunity for all,\" Jennifer Roberts, CEO of Chase Consumer Banking, said in a prepared statement.\n\nAlmost exactly one year ago, Chase said it would open more than 500 new branches across the country \u2014 and renovate 1,700 more \u2014 by 2027. The multibillion-dollar effort includes plans for branches in new markets, low- to moderate-income communities and rural communities. The bank has previously highlighted expansions in locations like Boston, Charlotte, the Washington, D.C., area, Minneapolis and Philadelphia.\n\nIn 2024, Chase added more than 175 branch locations across the country while closing 110, per data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\nLast May, Roberts said during an investor presentation that about 900,000 people walked into the company's 4,900 locations each day. Some 40% of the company's deposit-share gains since 2019 were attributable to investments in new branches, she added. The bank was on track to spend $800 million on field and branch investments in 2024, she said at the time.\n\n\"People like to visit their money,\" JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said during a conference a few weeks later.\n\nChase's push in Alabama is part of that game plan. The bank made a similar push in Iowa last fall, saying that it will open 25 new locations in the Hawkeye State by 2030.\n\nIn the last five years, Chase has added more than 650 branches , 400 of which were in 25 new states. Since 2021, the bank has been operating branches in every U.S. state except Hawaii and Alaska.\n\nThe strategy of adding in-person locations originally made it an outlier among major banks, as branch closures accelerated when the pandemic hit, and consumer demand for digital services rose. But in the last year, the megabank's peers have begun to recalibrate their own physical blueprints, making investments in grabbing deposit share across under-tapped or high-growth markets.\n\nBranch banking Why megabanks are seeing the value in new branches Bank of America is planning to open 165 new branches by the end of 2026. As brick-and-mortar locations remain critical for adding new customer accounts, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are also making targeted additions to their branch networks. September 23\n\nBank of America said in September that it plans to open 165 branches by the end of 2026 in markets where it has a smaller presence. Although the bank has reduced its total location count by nearly 40% in the last 15 years, its deposits have doubled in the same amount of time.\n\nWells Fargo has looked at targeted expansions to build its deposit base in markets like Chicago, where it's said it will add at least 23 branches.\n\nIn November, PNC Financial Services Group said it would double its previously announced branch expansion plan . Now, the bank is slated to spend $1.5 billion to open 200 new branches in major cities throughout states like Texas, North Carolina and Florida, spending an additional $500 million to build more than 100 branches in select cities over the next five years. The fast-growing bank is the eighth-largest in the country, with more than 2,200 branches across 29 states.\n\nThough numerous major banks have been reaffirming their commitments to branches, Chase has led the charge, said Steve Reider, president of Bancography, a research and consulting firm with a focus on bank branches.\n\nHe added Chase is looking to build a foothold in all of the major U.S. markets, and is dropping pins more rapidly in places where it previously had a more minor presence.\n\n\"One thing that is attractive for financial institutions in Alabama is that we're not a very cyclical economy,\" said Reider, who's based in Birmingham. \"So while there aren't booms, there also don't tend to be busts, the way you might in an oil-dependent region. \u2026 But my premise is that it's less about that, and more about filling in the gaps, and entering as many markets of size as possible.\"\n\nThe branch expansion trend hasn't yet been embraced by the entire banking industry, according to recent data. In the third quarter of last year, banks in the U.S. closed 439 locations , more than double the pace of the prior quarter and the highest quarterly number of net closings since the start of 2022, per S&P.\n\nRegions Financial, the largest bank headquartered in Alabama, has been trimming costs recently across staffing, branches, office space and vendor budgets \u2014 and it could cut more, the bank said in its recent earnings report.\n\nMegabanks have the scale to build dominance, Reider said. For example, Chase isn't going into new markets and opening one location, it's dropping dozens.\n\n\"Banks are looking to say, 'We're going to go into this market, we're going to win,'\" Reider said.\n\n",

Worthington also raised his price target on the stock to $53 from $44, indicating 20.5% upside potential from Tuesday's close. Janus Henderson on Jan. 31 posted fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat expectations, driven in part by its fixed income business. Worthington cited his confidence in CEO Ali Dibadj's initiatives to upgrade and refocus the firm to increase its market share and take advantage of its strong balance sheet as catalysts for the upgrade. \"We see Janus as the turnaround story in traditional asset management,\" Worthington wrote in a note. \"The difference between Janus and peers that are pursuing a similar strategy is that Janus's core business has better performance and [management] is being more innovative around growth priorities,\" Worthington added. The firm is on a path for sustainable organic growth, and its recent results show that it is able to win more businesses, the analyst noted. \"While we still envision a period of heightened flows risk and a long road ahead in the transformation journey, we acknowledge the early progress in the strategic initiatives and we have increasing confidence in the management team's ability for continued successful execution,\" Worthington said. Worthington's rating puts him in the minority of those covering the stock. LSEG data shows that 9 of 10 analysts who cover Janus Henderson have a hold rating on it.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other high flying AI stocks.\n\nIn the artificial intelligence world, the spotlight will be shifting to France next week as the world awaits the US and China to find common ground over the safe development of artificial intelligence. Judging by the measured response from China over the tariffs issue, there is a chance it might. That noted, a wide variety of countries are going to be attending an AI Action Summit in Paris next week to discuss how to put the technology to work. France is going to be hosting the summit alongside India on Feb 10 and 11, focusing on areas such as open-source systems and clean energy for powering data centers, Reuters reported.\n\nREAD NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street and 9 AI Stocks Investors Are Monitoring\n\nMeanwhile, the emergence of DeepSeek is increasingly turning into a game-changing event for AI development in China. The founder, Liang Wenfeng, is being hailed as a national hero. Indeed, his efforts have greatly helped the country to catch up with the US in the race toward AI supremacy. Chinese companies are increasingly rushing to support AI models coming from DeepSeek. Moore Threads and Hygon Information Technology, for instance, said on Monday that their computing clusters and accelerators will be able to support Deep Seek\u2019s R1 and V3 models. Moore Threads, in particular, stated that progress by DeepSeek\u2019s models using domestically made GPUs could set China's AI industry \u201con fire\u201d.\n\nWhile many of the companies in China are rushing to adopt DeepSeek, yet many others are pushing their own AI models forward. Alibaba Cloud released Qwen 2.5-Max just after DeepSeek over the holidays, Beijing-based start-up Zhipu is also in the AI race with its AI assistant app released in October, Chinese start-up Moonshot AI released its own LLM the day DeepSeek released its r1 model, and more. These moves by Chinese companies, and the broader market reaction in the US after the emergence of DeepSeek, reflect on how grave the impact has been on the AI world.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(JPM) is a financial services company that serves millions of customers and many of the world\u2019s most prominent corporate, institutional, and government clients daily. The New York-based company manages assets and investments, offers business advice and strategies, and provides innovative banking solutions and services.\n\nThis financial service provider\u2019s shares have significantly outpaced the broader market over the past 52 weeks. JPM has rallied 52.7% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has gained 20.9%. Moreover, the stock is up 11.3% on a YTD basis, compared to SPX\u2019s 1.9% rise during the same time frame.\n\nZooming in further, JPMorgan\u2019s outperformance becomes more evident when compared to the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLF) 31.5% return over the past 52 weeks and 6.1% gain on a YTD basis.\n\nOn Jan. 15, shares of JPM surged 2% after its better-than-expected Q4 earnings release. A massive 49% growth in investment banking fees and 21% higher trading revenue resulted in a 10.9% year-over-year rise in the company\u2019s top line to $42.8 billion, which outpaced Wall Street\u2019s expectations by a notable 4.4%. Moreover, its EPS advanced 58.2% from the year-ago quarter to $4.81 and easily topped the estimates by a whopping 19.4%, despite a rise in adjusted operating expenses.\n\nHowever, its Net Interest Income (NII) declined 3% annually to $23.3 billion due to lower rates and deposit margin compression across the lines of business. Nevertheless, the overall strong results overshadowed this decline. The stock continued its upward momentum, reaching a 52-week high of $270.82 on Jan. 31.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect JPM\u2019s EPS to decline 2.1% year over year to $17.82. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is promising. It surpassed the Wall Street estimates in each of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 24 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d which is based on 13 \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d two \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d eight \u201cHold,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell\u201d rating.\n\nThis configuration is slightly more bullish than three months ago, with 12 analysts suggesting a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating.\n\nOn Jan. 15, Goldman Sachs maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on JPMorgan and raised its price target to $295, which indicates a 10.6% potential upside from the current levels.\n\nAs of writing, the company is trading marginally above its mean price target of $266.65. The Street-high price target of $330 suggests an upside potential of 23.7%.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "This article originally appeared on Business Insider.\n\nSome Americans facing return-to-office mandates are doing whatever they can to keep working from home.\n\nTake Richard, who began working for Amazon last year as a finance manager. He said the company's three-days-a-week in-office policy wasn't ideal because his prior job was fully remote, but he accepted the role because he felt Amazon offered better growth opportunities.\n\nHowever, when the company announced that it would be ramping up its return-to-office policy in 2025 to five days a week, Richard decided to try to jump ship.\n\n\"I immediately started applying for remote jobs,\" said Richard, whose identity was verified by Business Insider but asked to use a pseudonym for fear of professional repercussions. \"I wanted to get ahead of the rush of people that would be applying once the policy went into effect.\"\n\nRichard is among the Americans reacting to their companies' return-to-office mandates. In recent months, corporate giants like Amazon, AT&T, and JPMorgan have issued timelines for when employees must return to the office five days a week. In response, some workers have begun searching for remote or hybrid jobs so they can quit and avoid returning to the office full-time.\n\nIn a Pew Research survey of 2,315 US adults conducted in October, 46% of respondents who worked from home at least some of the time said they would be very or somewhat unlikely to stay in their role if their employer no longer allowed them to work from home. This included 61% of respondents who worked from home all the time. However, finding a new remote role isn't easy: Job seekers have encountered a challenging labor market and intense competition for roles that allow working from home.\n\nRichard, who's in his 30s, said he hadn't had much luck in his job hunt so far and expanded his search to hybrid roles. He hopes that hiring will pick up later this year.\n\n\"There are less and less fully remote roles and more people trying to fill them,\" he said. \"It has been hard to get far in the interview process.\"\n\nIn a September memo to employees, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said, \"The advantages of being together in the office are significant.\" In a January memo, JPMorgan's operating committee said it thought bringing workers back to the office was \"the best way to run the company.\"\n\nHow employees are trying to work around RTO mandates\n\nSome Americans managed to secure work-from-home roles before the market became more challenging.\n\nIn 2022, George was working remotely as an IT professional in the financial industry. When his employer began discussing return-to-office plans \u2014 some teams were asked to switch from remote to hybrid \u2014 he found a new remote role.\n\nGeorge, 39, kept his original job and juggles both roles simultaneously to help ensure he'll always have at least one remote gig. He's earning about $250,000 annually \u2014 roughly double his prior income.\n\n\"I ultimately decided to try it since I could easily just drop one if it was too much,\" George, whose identity was verified by BI but asked to use a pseudonym for fear of professional repercussions, previously told BI.\n\nWhile some workers might be fine with hybrid working arrangements, there's no guarantee a company won't later issue a stricter return-to-office mandate. This is among the reasons Steven, an e-commerce professional in New Jersey, prioritized a fully remote working arrangement during his job search.\n\nAfter being laid off two years ago from a job that allowed him to work remotely, Steven applied for a mix of in-person and remote roles. Last February, he landed an offer from JPMorgan that would require him to work from the office three days a week in Manhattan.\n\nAs he mulled over the offer, he estimated that his commuting time would total nine hours a week \u2014 or roughly 450 hours a year. Parking at his local train station and taking the New Jersey Transit would cost him roughly $7,200 in annual commuting costs.\n\nAround the same time, Steven received another job offer \u2014 this one for a remote position that offered an annual salary that was about $5,000 lower than the pay for the JPMorgan role. When he compared the jobs in terms of the money he'd earn for every hour he'd have to \"invest\" in them \u2014 including commuting time \u2014 he said it was an easy choice to pick the remote role.\n\n\"JPMorgan just could not compete,\" he said, adding: \"A 40-hour week plus nine commute hours is basically a 50-hour week for the salary that they were offering.\"\n\nSteven said he's particularly grateful he turned down the offer because on January 10, JPMorgan announced that most employees would be required to work from the office five days a week beginning in March.\n\nMeanwhile, Richard is still looking for a remote role while commuting to his current job. Because of space constraints at his office, he said, he doesn't have to comply with Amazon's five-day-a-week policy until April. In the meantime, he's found ways to minimize his in-office time.\n\nRichard said he typically goes into the office three days a week but estimated that he works from there only between nine and 12 hours a week across the three days. He thinks he can get away with this because he's the only one from his team who works at that office location.\n\n\"I would go into the office for a few hours, avoid rush hour, and fulfill my badging requirement,\" he said, adding that he planned to take a similar approach once the five-day-a-week policy took effect.\n\nGeorge said his second employer appears to have permanently embraced remote work but that he still has some concerns that his original employer will eventually require him to return to the office. He said he lives roughly 14 miles from the nearest office \u2014 an hourlong commute with traffic and about 30 minutes without.\n\nSteven said his employer had called some workers back to the office but that he'd been told this wouldn't affect him because he was designated as a remote worker when he was hired. He thinks his company offers workers in certain roles this perk to attract and retain talent.\n\n\"If you want to be able to find the right kind of people,\" he said, \"you're going to be much more successful at finding people if you allow remote work.\"",

Many of the bank\u2019s more than 300,000 workers are expected to be in the office five days a week starting on March 3, even though the bank is still wrestling with where to put them all, according to several JPMorgan employees.\n\nPhil de Josselin, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief administrative officer, alerted employees on Thursday that many of the company\u2019s banks and offices will be ready to accommodate five-day-a-week work starting in early March. Other employees will apparently get a reprieve from the RTO for now.\n\n\u201cMany of our locations globally will be ready to welcome employees back in early March; other sites will need more time to get ready,\u201d Josselin wrote in a Jan. 30 email that was viewed by Fortune.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has created a listing, which it called a lookup tool, that showed the approximate time that work sites will be ready for employees to use, Josselin said. The list was available on the bank\u2019s internal intranet. Many of the sites have a March 3 return date while some have March 10, according to six employees who viewed the list. (All JPMorgan Chase workers questioned by Fortune refused to speak on the record for fear of retaliation.)\n\nJPMorgan Chase did not return requests for comment.\n\nSome bank locations are getting more time to comply with the RTO. Two JPMorgan buildings in Plano, Texas, are listed as \u201cnot yet determined,\u201d as is a site in Greenwood Village, Colorado. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Polaris regional headquarters in Ohio, which houses more than 12,000 employees, is also not yet available. The four-story, 2 million-square-foot building was listed Thursday as \u201cnot yet determined.\u201d JPMorgan spent about $200 million on the redesign and renovation of the Polaris location, which is located at the McCoy center in Columbus, according to a 2017 report from Columbus Business First.\n\n\u201cThat implies they do not yet have a strategy to accommodate everyone from the teams in those buildings or they need to reshuffle the floors,\u201d one of the employees told Fortune.\n\nOn January 10, JPMorgan Chase set off a firestorm when the bank informed its more than 300,000 employees that all staff would be required to return to the office five days a week, possibly as early as March. Roughly 40% of the bank\u2019s employees are currently on a hybrid schedule, where they are in the office three days a week.\n\nAbout 60% of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s staff, including many traders and retail branch workers, currently come into the office five days a week.\n\nMany workers remain unhappy with the RTO. One employee, who works from home two days a week, had already told their fianc\u00e9 to accept a job that was three hours away when they found out about the RTO mandate.",

            "content": "Tesla Inc TSLA, the eighth most valuable company in the world, is worth $1.24 trillion. Banking giant JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ranks 13th with a market cap of $749.15 billion.\n\nComparing EVs to finance may seem like apples to oranges, but many consider Tesla to be more than a traditional auto stock. Also, the comparison and use of financial tools like price-to-earnings ratios can help show when companies are overvalued or undervalued.\n\nWhat Happened: Tesla recently reported fourth-quarter and full fiscal-year financial results. Its revenue and earnings per share missed analyst estimates in the fourth quarter.\n\nFor the full fiscal year, Tesla reported $8.4 billion in net income and earnings per share of $2.42. Its profitability as an EV company differs from competitors who continue to lose money. Tesla's focus on scale and vertical integration has helped.\n\nWith earnings per share of $2.42 and a share price of $384.70, Tesla stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 159.0. This is on the high side even for the fastest-growing technology stocks, which puts the question on how Tesla should be valued into question.\n\nJPMorgan also recently reported its full-year financial results. In the last fiscal year, JPMorgan had net income of $58.5 billion. That\u2019s nearly seven times more than Tesla's net income. JPMorgan had earnings per share of $19.75 in the last fiscal year.\n\nTaking JPMorgan's share price of $268.00, the firm has a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.6.\n\nAre you buying when the CEOs of the Magnificent 7 are selling?\n\nStay in the know with our Insider Trades page \u2014 see when leaders like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Jensen Huang are offloading their own shares.\n\nWhy It's Important: Tesla would be worth $32.84 per share if it traded at the same P/E ratio of JPMorgan. Keep in mind that automotive stocks often have lower P/E. Ford Motor Company F trades at 11.5x earnings and General Motors Company GM trades at 7.8x earnings.\n\nFor Tesla, many investors and analysts believe that the future valuation of robotaxis, new models, AI, FSD and the Optimus Bot are not priced in. That means shareholders are likely paying more today based on the future valuation.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said that he believes Tesla could be worth more than several of the largest companies in the world combined if they are able to meet all their ambitious goals.\n\nArk Invest CEO Cathie Wood, a Tesla investor, told Benzinga last year that it should trade more like a high-growth tech stock than an automotive stock.\n\nWhile it's well-known for its EVs, Tesla also operates in fields like solar, energy storage, AI, autonomous driving and robotics.\n\nFor this reason, Wood said that Tesla should trade like a technology stock and not like traditional automakers, something that analysts and Tesla bears can't grasp.\n\n\"That's why they're getting it wrong,\" Wood told Benzinga on \u201cThe Raz Report.\u201d\n\nAutonomous taxi platforms could be \"the biggest AI project in the world,\" she said. \"This is not an auto play. This is an autonomous taxi platform play with software-as-a-service like margins.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan would trade at $3,139.66 per share if it had the same P/E ratio of Tesla. Instead, the bank is a value stock. Its price-to-earnings ratio of 13.6x is similar to, or slightly lower than other large financial institutions.\n\nWhen it comes to using P/E ratios and looking at growth versus value, Tesla could be overvalued and JPMorgan could be undervalued. Tesla could also be undervalued when looking at its P/E compared to other tech stocks and the future valuations of items not priced in. Time will tell if both companies can show that they should be worth more than their current stock prices.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage: Shutterstock",

For an outsider, the money would appear to pay for Turkey\u2019s first nuclear-power plant.\n\n\u201cThe investigators found that Russia and Turkey used the nuclear project in 2022 to dance around US sanctions imposed on Russia\u2019s central bank, according to people familiar with the matter,\u201d WSJ wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo prominent American banks, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, acted as intermediaries \u2013 correspondent banks \u2013 to handle the payments. This attracted the attention of Justice Department investigators, who tasked the banks to freeze the money transfer until they finished an investigation.\n\n\u201cUS prosecutors in 2024 prepared to try to seize the money on the grounds it was the proceeds of sanctions evasion, money laundering and bank fraud. But they were blocked in the final stretch of the Biden administration, the people said, because the White House wanted to avoid angering Turkey, a vital but sometimes contentious ally,\u201d the article writes.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Trump Sees \u2018Good\u2019 Chance for Peace; Kyiv Denies Trump Claim of Ukrainian Troop Encirclement The US president made his claims following a meeting between Putin and US envoy Steve Witkoff\n\nA representative from the Trump administration told WSJ that \u201cthe US government will keep reviewing its sanction regimes and act against people who try to evade them.\u201d\n\nHow Turkey and Rosatom plotted to avoid sanctions\n\nRussia\u2019s state energy giant Rosatom operates around the world and acts as an umbrella for numerous organizations that form divisions producing nuclear fuel, reactors, electricity, nuclear ammunition, equipment for the nuclear industry, and chemical products.\n\nThe \u201cumbrella\u201d method is used to help Russia avoid sanctions. Approximately 4% of companies within the Rosatom structure fall under sanctions, Olena Lapenko from think tank DiXi Group told Kyiv Post in an interview. Some of these legal entities can call themselves research institutes but import dual-use components for the military, she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spokeswoman for Rosatom told WSJ that \u201call funds allocated to the nuclear plant have been used to finance the project and pay for contractors and other social and financial commitments in Turkey,\u201d not connecting it to the US Justice Department investigation.\n\nThe US froze Russia\u2019s sovereign central bank reserves right after the invasion, a move by Western governments in response to Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv Post previously wrote.\n\nBut Elvira Nabiullina, Russian central bank governor, and other senior Russian officials established a route to create an offshore dollar reserve to fund Russian interests beyond America\u2019s gaze, WSJ sources reported.\n\nAny dollar money transfers require operations through intermediary banks.\n\n\u201cRussia and Turkey agreed unsanctioned Gazprombank, the banking arm of Russia\u2019s state gas company, would lend about $9 billion to the nuclear plant being built by Rosatom, which also wasn\u2019t under sanctions, the people said. What they didn\u2019t disclose: The Bank of Russia would secretly fund the loan, and the nuclear project wasn\u2019t its only purpose,\u201d WSJ wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Gazprombank, the transfer was sent to Turkish state-owned bank Ziraat through American intermediaries.\n\n\u201cUnder Moscow\u2019s plan, the nuclear plant could hand dollars to Russian firms that also had accounts at Turkey\u2019s biggest bank, state-owned Ziraat,\u201d the article wrote.\n\n\u201cIn the summer of 2022, Gazprombank sent $3 billion through Citi to the nuclear plant\u2019s deposits at Ziraat. A bit more than $2 billion ran through JPMorgan,\u201d WSJ reported.\n\nThe US State Department noticed the payments, started an investigation and blocked the $2 billion from reaching Turkey, freezing the funds.\n\n\u201cThe White House and State Department were nervous\u201d because Biden\u2019s administration feared the freeze could undermine cooperation with Erdogan\u2019s government in efforts to stabilize Syria and the war in Gaza.\n\n\u201cA big reason for the trepidation, some of the people said: The Justice Department suspects one of Erdogan\u2019s top lieutenants, intelligence director Ibrahim Kalin, was involved in the payments in 2022,\u201d the article wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House asked the Justice Department to stand down under Biden, but WSJ reported it\u2019s unknown what the Trump administration will decide regarding the case.",

            "content": "Herman Ko, 27, deferred his college graduation by one semester to intern at JPMorgan.\n\nHe managed to land a full-time role there but decided to quit just over three years into the job.\n\nKo says the long hours, as well as a mismatch with his career aspirations, drove him to leave.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Herman Ko, 27, a former banker at JPMorgan. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment history.\n\nI wasn't the most academically focused student back in college.\n\nI didn't have a perfect GPA, and I didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted to do for my career. I only knew I wanted two things in a job \u2014 one, it had to be prestigious, and two, it had to offer good career mobility if I ever wanted to leave my job.\n\nI decided to focus on getting a job at an investment bank. Admittedly, I was chasing a shiny object, but it ticked all my boxes, whether be it in terms of pay, prestige, or exit opportunities.\n\nI figured that since there wasn't something I particularly enjoyed doing, I might as well pick a job that offered the maximum potential and benefits.\n\nThat said, the journey to landing a job at a bulge bracket bank was tough. When I started applying for internships, my GPA was only 2.4 out of 4.3. I also didn't have any familial connections who could offer me job referrals.\n\nThat drove me to approach my job hunt differently from most of my peers. I knew that I couldn't let my GPA, which is really just one line in my entire CV, define my application.\n\nTo that end, I experimented with different interview methods and revised my CV countless times. I networked with finance professionals to get a better sense of what life is like on the trading floor. That way, I could try to position myself as an industry professional instead of a wide-eyed student trying to find his way.\n\nAnother thing I did to distinguish myself during my internships was perform magic tricks at events like my boss's birthday. That helped to leave a memorable impression on my colleagues.\n\nDeferring my graduation to clinch a gig at JPMorgan\n\nKo says he had to give up his return offer at Deutsche Bank and defer his graduation by one semester to intern at JPMorgan. Herman Ko\n\nI actually secured a return offer from Deutsche Bank after interning for them one year before my graduation.\n\nRelated stories\n\nHowever, in my final year, I decided to apply to American banks since they are seen as more prestigious than their European counterparts. That's when I received a summer internship offer from JPMorgan.\n\nThat presented two problems for me. Firstly, if I wanted to intern at JPMorgan, I had to give up my job offer at Deutsche Bank. Secondly, I had to defer my graduation by a semester in order to intern at JPMorgan as an undergraduate.\n\nAlthough it was a huge gamble, I decided to intern at JPMorgan anyway. To me, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work at one of the top banks in the world.\n\nFortunately, I did well in the internship and earned a spot on JPMorgan's two-year graduate rotation program. I did four different rotations, where I got to pitch and sell cash management and treasury products to clients. At the end of the program, I landed a full-time role at the bank.\n\nWorking at JPMorgan was an exhilarating experience. Everyone I got to work with was insanely smart. I learnt a lot from JPMorgan's in-house training as well as on the job.\n\nLeaving JPMorgan and charting a new path\n\nKo says he's still able to use the sales and pitching skills he picked up at JPMorgan in his new role at Career Hackers, a human resources and education technology startup. Herman Ko\n\nAfter working at JPMorgan for about 3 \u00bd years, I decided to call it quits. For one, the long hours I was clocking were starting to take a toll on my body.\n\nI also realized that the work done in an investment bank is very specialized. In my case, I was tasked with marketing financial products specifically to financial institutions.\n\nThat wasn't what I wanted for my career. I wanted to stay ahead of the curve and cover solutions powered by the latest technologies instead of traditional financial products.\n\nOn a deeper level, I also wanted to challenge myself. Though I was achieving a lot at JPMorgan, I couldn't tell how much of that was driven by the bank's reputation. I wanted to see if I could still excel without relying on the JPMorgan brand.\n\nThat eventually led me to my current employer, Career Hackers, a human resources and education technology startup. My new role aligned with my passions and interest in mentoring and technology.\n\nEven though I'm now working at a startup, I can still use the sales skills I picked up at JPMorgan. As a junior banker, I got to learn the ropes by first taking meeting minutes and then gradually progress to lead client conversations myself.\n\nThat has made the transition to my new role a lot smoother since startup work tends to be self-directed.\n\nLooking back, I have no regrets about starting my career at JPMorgan. The opportunities and exposure I got there could not have been found anywhere else.",

The delivery notices \u2014 which total 30 million troy ounces of gold \u2014 were the second-largest ever in bourse data going back to 1994.\n\nFears of imminent tariffs on imports following the election of US President Donald Trump have caused prices for gold futures on Comex to surge over spot prices in London.\n\nGold bars are pictured at bullion house in Mumbai on Dec. 3, 2009. Photo: Arko Datta, Reuters\n\nSpot prices shot to record highs this week, but the additional premium on Comex has created a lucrative arbitrage opportunity for the handful of banks that could quickly fly bullion between key trading hubs.\n\nSimilar pricing dynamics have emerged in other Comex contracts too, and the disparity has become so large that traders have started flying silver into the country.\n\nThe precious metal is usually too cheap and bulky to justify the cost of airfreight, and one industry veteran said it is the first time they have seen it happen.\n\nWhile millions of ounces of gold trade on Comex every day, typically only a small fraction of that goes to physical delivery, with most long positions being rolled over or closed out before they expire.\n\nThe exchange is often used to hedge positions in London, the largest trading hub, with banks offsetting longs with paper short positions in New York. However, since the day of the US election last year, physical inventories in the exchange\u2019s depositories have swelled by 13 million ounces, about US$38 billion of gold.\n\nIt is unclear whether JPMorgan or the other banks were delivering bullion physically to take advantage of an arbitrage opportunity, or were simply using the deliveries to exit existing short positions. JPMorgan and exchange owner CME Group Inc declined to comment.\n\nJPMorgan issued delivery notices for 1.485 million ounces of gold to meet physical delivery for this month\u2019s gold 100-ounce contract, with deliveries tomorrow.\n\nThat accounted for roughly half the total to be delivered, with Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc making up the bulk of the rest.\n\nDeutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while Goldman did not immediately provide comment.",

            "content": "A few months after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia made a series of huge money transfers to Turkey. In a fairly short time, more than $5 billion was transferred with the promise of further payments. This was reported by The Wall Street Journal, according to UNN.\n\nDetails\n\nAccording to the publication, these funds were officially intended for the construction of Turkey's first nuclear power plant, Akkuyu, a project supported by dictator Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nHowever, US regulators noticed suspicious activity in these transfers. Two leading U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, helped process these payments, which attracted the attention of U.S. Department of Justice investigators.\n\nInvestigators found that in 2022, Russia and Turkey used this nuclear project to quietly transfer billions of dollars through US banks to Turkey and then fund Russian state initiatives.\n\nRussia and Turkey agreed that Gazprombank, which is not under sanctions, would provide a $9 billion loan for the construction of the nuclear power plant. In reality, this money was financed by the Bank of Russia, which was hidden from international observers, - the publication notes.\n\nAfter receiving the funds, Turkish banks transferred them to Russian companies that had accounts with Ziraat, the largest Turkish state-owned bank. This scheme allowed Russia to circumvent U.S. sanctions without having to conduct transactions directly through U.S. banks.\n\nIn 2022, Gazprombank transferred $3 billion through Citigroup to Ziraat accounts. Another $2 billion went through JPMorgan.\n\nWhen the U.S. Department of Justice discovered the suspicious transactions, it stopped the next tranche of $2 billion that remained frozen at JPMorgan.\n\n\u201cThis money was stolen from us\": peskov threatens to take legal action for transferring funds from russian assets to ukraine\n\nIn 2024, U.S. prosecutors prepared to confiscate $2 billion, arguing that the money was the result of sanctions evasion and money laundering. However, the Biden administration intervened and blocked the process.\n\nThe White House feared that the move could anger Turkey, a key but unpredictable US ally. The US government often coordinates the actions of the Department of Justice with the State Department and the National Security Council if they could affect diplomatic relations.\n\nSuch requests for a complete freeze of the case are rare - said the former prosecutors.\n\nAnkara has a difficult position in global politics. It did not join the sanctions against Russia, maintaining economic cooperation with Moscow. At the same time, Turkey supplied Ukraine with lethal weapons. In 2024, Turkey helped to release the American WSJ journalist Evan Hershkovich as part of a prisoner exchange between the United States and Russia.\n\nWashington feared that if the DOJ investigation directly affected Turkey, it could harm cooperation between the two countries on such important issues as prisoner exchange, the fight against terrorism, and the stabilization of Syria.\n\n1 billion dollars: Ukraine receives the first tranche of frozen assets from the US\n\nU.S. investigators suspect that the key role in the transfers was played by Turkish intelligence director Ibrahim Kalin, who was then President Erdogan's chief adviser. Also, the then Turkish Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati could have been involved in the scheme. None of them commented on the allegations.\n\nNow the issue of the frozen $2 billion falls on the shoulders of the new administration of Donald Trump.\n\nInterestingly, in Trump's first term, his government had already accused the Turkish state-owned bank Halkbank of violating sanctions against Iran, which caused significant tension between Washington and Ankara. Whether Trump will go for an open confrontation with Turkey this time will become known in the coming months, the publication notes.\n\nAll frozen assets of the russian federation in the EU should be sent to Ukraine - EU diplomat Kaja Kallas",

            "content": "US banking giant JPMorgan plans to deliver $4bn of gold bullion to New York this month, before an anticipated escalation of Donald Trump\u2019s trade-rebalancing tariff moves planned for Saturday.\n\nThe US bank, the world\u2019s biggest bullion dealer, said it would deliver the hefty raw material against contracts that will expire in February. Several institutions declared plans to deliver bullion, which in total will weigh 30m troy ounces of gold, or 2m lbs.\n\nThe delivery comes as the price of gold has surged to $2,813 per ounce, and the delivery notices are the second largest ever in bourse data going back to 1994, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe outlet has also reported that tariff-war fears have made it profitable to fly silver into the US \u2013 a commodity that typically is transported by ship because it is considered too cheap and bulky to justify the costs.\n\nThe gold shipment is just one of a series of signals that Trump\u2019s tariff threats are reshaping global trade, which many fear could exacerbate inflation in the US and test the patience of allies.\n\nTrump is expected to move ahead with plans on Saturday to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and a 10% levy on China. The three countries account for almost half of the total volume of US imports. The US president has hinted at a reprieve for Mexico and Canada if they move against undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs coming across their borders into the US.\n\nBefore an expected press conference at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on Saturday, Trump said he planned to impose new tariffs on imports of computer chips, pharmaceuticals, steel, aluminum, copper, oil and gas as soon as mid-February.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll happen fairly soon,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office, saying he also wants to hike tariffs on the European Union, which has \u201ctreated us so horribly\u201d. Trump didn\u2019t specify the European behaviors or actions he was referring to, but the tariff threats are a part of a pressure package on Europe to increase domestic defense spending.\n\nOn Friday, Trump dismissed concerns that increased US import tariffs could increase domestic US inflation and disrupt global supply chains. Trump said \u201cthere could be some temporary, short-term disruption and people will understand that\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe tariffs are going to make us very rich and very strong,\u201d he added.\n\nUS industries, including the oil and auto sectors, have lobbied the new administration for tariff exemptions, while Canada and Mexico have prepared a list of retaliatory measures to hit US products.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said \u201ctariff\u201d is among his favorite words and sees import duties as a way to finance the extension of his first-term tax cuts that are due to expire in 2026.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Grzegorz Wajda/SOPA/Getty Images\n\nTesla is up 8% since its earnings report on Wednesday, despite missing profit and revenue estimates.\n\nJPMorgan criticized Tesla's valuation, citing a pattern of missed earnings projections.\n\nIt said Elon Musk's bold predictions may have influenced the stock's rise.\n\nJPMorgan thinks Tesla's post-earnings stock rally of 8% despite missing analysts' profit and revenue estimates is a head-scratcher.\n\nThe bank, which has long been bearish on Tesla stock, said in a note on Thursday that a 38% miss in earnings before interest and taxes and the lowest profit margin in years were yet another sign that the company is overvalued.\n\n\"The move higher in Tesla shares bore no relation whatsoever to the company's financial performance in the quarter just completed or to its outlook for growth in the coming year,\" the analyst Ryan Brinkman said.\n\nBrinkman offered several theories about what drove the stock higher after Tesla's earnings report, including the sky-high projections CEO Elon Musk made during the earnings call.\n\n\"Perhaps it was management's statement that it had identified an achievable path to becoming worth more than the world's five most valuable companies taken together,\" Brinkman said.\n\n\"Or maybe it was management's belief that just one of its products has by itself the potential to generate 'north of $10 trillion in revenue,'\" he added, referring to a prediction made on the call about Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot.\n\nBut Brinkman isn't buying what Musk is selling, sticking with his $135 price target, which represents potential downside of 68% from current levels.\n\nTesla reported its first annual sales decline since selling its first car in 2008. It reported fourth-quarter revenue of $25.7 billion, missing estimates by $1.4 billion, and earnings per share of $0.73, missing estimates by $0.02.\n\nBut to Brinkman, the most concerning aspect may have been the guidance for a return to growth in 2025.\n\nBrinkman highlighted that the outlook Tesla provided during its third-quarter earnings call for vehicle deliveries to grow by 20% to 30% in 2025 was moderated to only \"a return to growth.\"\n\n\"This fits into a broader pattern for Tesla shares \u2014 the company's financial performance and Bloomberg consensus for revenue, margin, earnings, and cash flow all keep coming down, but analyst price targets and the company's share price keep going up,\" Brinkman said.\n\nFor example, Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings before interest and taxes of $1.58 billion was 38% below the $2.5 billion Wall Street expected, but 10 quarters ago, analyst consensus for fourth-quarter 2024 EBIT stood at nearly $9 billion, representing an 82% miss from that estimate.",

Several whistleblower complaints were also filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Reserve in 2022, per the report.\n\nCiting a source in the banking industry, the report says the Federal Reserve allowed JPMorgan Chase and other big US lenders to continue the practice that\u2019s prohibited not just by the Fed but also globally.\n\nThe ICIJ report quotes US Senator Elizabeth Warren saying,\n\n\u201cInconsistent and lax bank supervision has crashed our economy before. [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell owes the American people an explanation for allowing CEOs to manipulate their financial reports so they can pay themselves and their wealthy investors more in executive compensation and buybacks.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s alleged years-long habit of misreporting its complexity indicators allowed the mega lender to expand its loan book by between $75 billion to $100 billion and in the process allegedly earned the bank as much as $2 billion in additional net income in one fiscal year, according to the ICIJ report.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023 earnings call, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledged the mega lender goes to great lengths to minimize its capital reserves requirements.\n\nDimon said,\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got our smartest people, we\u2019re going to figure out every angle to reduce capital requirements for JPMorgan. That\u2019s the difference.

            "content": "JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM is preparing to deliver gold bullion valued at over $4 billion in New York this February, amid rising prices and increased demand for the precious metal.\n\nWhat Happened: The bank, recognized as the largest bullion dealer globally, announced on Thursday. According to a report by Bloomberg, JPMorgan plans to deliver gold against contracts expiring in February on the CME Group\u2019s Comex.\n\nThe delivery notices, amounting to 30 million troy ounces, represent the second-largest tranche on record since 1994.\n\nGold futures on Comex have surpassed London spot prices due to tariff concerns following President Donald Trump\u2019s election. This has created a profitable arbitrage opportunity for banks capable of swiftly moving bullion between trading hubs.\n\nSimilar pricing trends have been observed in other Comex contracts, prompting traders to fly silver into the U.S. for the first time, despite its usual cost-prohibitive nature, the report added. While millions of ounces trade daily on Comex, only a small fraction typically results in physical delivery.\n\nSince the U.S. election, physical inventories in Comex depositories have increased by 13 million ounces, valued at approximately $38 billion.\n\nIt remains unclear if JPMorgan and other banks are delivering bullion for arbitrage or to exit short positions.\n\nWhy It Matters: The timing of JPMorgan\u2019s gold delivery coincides with Trump\u2019s announcement of new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, effective Feb. 1. These tariffs have already caused ripples in financial markets, raising concerns about their economic impact.\n\nGold has recently hit a record high, surpassing $2,790, driven by central banks\u2019 easing stance and increased demand for safe-haven assets. Several major central banks have signaled a more dovish stance on inflation, leading speculators to anticipate lower borrowing costs, further supporting gold prices.\n\nAdditionally, speculation over higher U.S. tariffs has led to increased demand for gold by central banks, with disruptions affecting trading in London.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock",

            "content": "The recent gains in Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) stock price following an earnings report that missed analyst expectations has left many, including JPMorgan (JPM) analysts, searching for answers in a sea of confusion. Despite reporting a 38% shortfall in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), with actual EBIT of $1.58 billion, compared to the expected $2.5 billion from Wall Street analysts, and experiencing the lowest profit margins in years, Tesla\u2019s stock reacted with an unexpected rally, prompting skepticism from JPMorgan\u2019s long bearish stance on the company\u2019s valuation.\n\nRyan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan, described the stock\u2019s movement as having \u201cno relation whatsoever\u201d to Tesla\u2019s actual financial performance or its guidance for future growth. This disconnect between the company\u2019s fundamentals and its market valuation has been a recurring theme, but the latest developments, including the company\u2019s Q4 net income plummeting 71% to $2.31 billion, down from $7.93 billion a year earlier, have further highlighted this anomaly.\n\nBrinkman speculated on several reasons behind the stock\u2019s rise, pointing to the ambitious, almost fantastical projections made by CEO Elon Musk during the earnings call. Musk\u2019s claims about Tesla achieving a valuation surpassing that of the world\u2019s top five companies combined, or the potential of a single product like the Optimus humanoid robot generating revenue in the trillions, seem to have captured investors\u2019 imagination despite their detachment from current financial realities.\n\nHowever, Brinkman remains unconvinced by these narratives, holding firm on his $135 price target for Tesla \u2014 a stance that suggests a steep 66% decline from its Friday close of $404.60. His skepticism stems from Tesla\u2019s recent struggles, including its first annual sales decline since its founding in 2008.\n\nThe adjustment in Tesla\u2019s growth outlook from a projected 20% to 30% increase in vehicle deliveries for 2025 to a more vague \u201creturn to growth\u201d was particularly concerning for Brinkman. This revision seems to underscore a pattern where Tesla\u2019s operational metrics like revenue, margins, earnings, and cash flow projections are continually revised downwards, yet the stock price continues to defy these fundamentals, buoyed by optimistic future projections and Musk\u2019s influence.\n\nThe broader context cannot be ignored, where Tesla benefits from Musk\u2019s proximity to political power and his status as the world\u2019s richest individual, factors that might contribute to investor confidence beyond mere financial metrics. Despite these misses, Tesla\u2019s stock has seen a solid 115% year-over-year increase, suggesting that market sentiment is driven by more than just the company\u2019s financial health.\n\nThis situation encapsulates the broader debate on market valuation: whether stocks should be priced on current earnings and fundamentals or on the promise of future innovation and market disruption. For now, Tesla\u2019s valuation appears to be more of a vote of confidence in Musk\u2019s vision than a reflection of its current financial state, a trend that continues to baffle traditional analysts like those at JPMorgan.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

It reported fourth-quarter revenue of $25.7 billion, missing estimates by $1.4 billion, and earnings per share of $0.73, missing estimates by $0.02.\n\nBut to Brinkman, the most concerning aspect may have been the guidance for a return to growth in 2025.\n\nBrinkman highlighted that the outlook Tesla provided during its third-quarter earnings call for vehicle deliveries to grow by 20% to 30% in 2025 was moderated to only \"a return to growth.\"\n\n\"This fits into a broader pattern for Tesla shares \u2014 the company's financial performance and Bloomberg consensus for revenue, margin, earnings, and cash flow all keep coming down, but analyst price targets and the company's share price keep going up,\" Brinkman said.\n\nFor example, Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings before interest and taxes of $1.58 billion was 38% below the $2.5 billion Wall Street expected, but 10 quarters ago, analyst consensus for fourth-quarter 2024 EBIT stood at nearly $9 billion, representing an 82% miss from that estimate.\n\n\"This brings us to the crux of the issue,\" Brinkman said. \"Tesla shares continue to strike us as having become completely divorced from the fundamentals.\"\n\nFor now, investors don't seem to care as Musk gets closer to the White House and continues to be the richest person in the world by a wide margin.\n\nShares of Tesla are up by 4% in the year to date and are up by 119% over the past year.",

He will also work in tandem with JPMorgan\u2019s Workplace Solutions to bolster client strategies.\n\nIn addition, Kevin Tompkins has been appointed as a senior cybersecurity specialist. Under the leadership of Ileana van der Linde, Tompkins will be crucial in fortifying the cybersecurity measures for the bank\u2019s clients.\n\nAlso, Christie Houlihan, a former EY senior family office adviser, joins the team to provide guidance on family office design and succession planning.\n\nHer collaboration with Elisa Shevlin Rizzo, Head of Family Advisory, will support families in managing wealth transitions.\n\nIs this the first step in a huge expansion of JPMorgan in the wealth space.\n\nPBI: Why is now the time to expand the private advisory team?\n\nBJ Goergen, Global Head of Private Advisory at JPMorgan Private Bank: The decision to expand Morgan Private Advisory was motivated by the changing needs of our clients. We collaborate with individuals, families, and business owners globally, all of whom are affected by global volatility, shifting regulatory landscapes, and swift technological advancements. By attracting top talent and specialized expertise, we strengthen our capacity to guide clients through these challenges and empower them to make more informed decisions about their future.\n\nWill this new team of experts be a differentiator in the market?\n\nAbsolutely. What sets us apart is the breadth and depth of experience our new team members bring, each in an area of significant interest to our clients. Morgan Private Advisory includes former practicing attorneys specializing in Trusts & Estates, M&A, and taxes, plus policy makers, business leaders, credentialed planners, and professionals across all disciplines that impact our clients. This expertise allows us to deliver trusted, actionable advice that is personalized to each client.\n\nHow important is it to have a cybersecurity expert in the private advisory team?\n\nIn today\u2019s digital age, cybersecurity is essential and a top priority for many of our clients. Adding Kevin to our team of experts elevates our collective expertise. We know that individuals and family offices are increasingly targeted by cyber threats \u2013 based on our 2024 Global Family Office Survey, we also know that many of our clients (40%) identified cybersecurity as a gap in their overall plans. Our Cyber Advisory team helps our clients protect their assets and personal information, and ensures our clients feel secure in every aspect of their financial lives.\n\nWealth transfer is set to be a big topic this year; what is the private advisory team\u2019s strategy? Or does it depend on the client/family?\n\nWealth transfer is a critical area of focus for us, as we recognize that each family has distinct goals and circumstances. We are closely monitoring legislative developments in Washington regarding the federal estate tax exemption, which is set to be reduced by half at the end of 2025, along with other expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In the meantime, our strategy advises clients to build resilient portfolios to protect against increased macroeconomic volatility. This resilience begins with revisiting a propriety Wealth Plan to ensure that investments are aligned with someone\u2019s goals, especially given the recent increase in household wealth. For those in the U.S. who are able, this year is an advantageous time to maximize the lifetime exclusion, a tax-free wealth transfer opportunity, before it is set to decrease after 2025.\n\nEach client has unique goals and priorities concerning their estate plan and family legacy, and it is our responsibility to ensure their financial plan aligns with these intentions.\n\nCan we expect to see this team expand more in the near future?\n\nYes! Our goal is to continuously enhance our capabilities and maintain our position as a leader in private advisory services. We plan to prioritize our advisory capabilities for executives, including those entering the c-suite, those building wealth in the c-suite, and those exiting the c-suite. Morgan Private Advisory will continue to invest in the tools and talent that allow us to deliver timely, impactful advice to our clients.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWhen the largest U.S. bank needs compute, there\u2019s little margin for error.\n\nExecutives at JPMorgan Chase don\u2019t want IT teams waiting in line to access resources needed to spin up an AI use case, upgrade a customer service portal, enhance market forecast analytics or support critical business applications.\n\n\u201cWe're putting a lot of effort into improving the ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development,\u201d the company\u2019s CFO Jeremy Barnum said during a January earnings call.\n\nAs technology drives business outcomes, infrastructure availability becomes a competitive advantage \u2014 and a priority.\n\n\u201cFor our capacity, we like to use a just-in-time model, which usually means planning years before we need the capacity \u2014 as much as five to 10 years out,\u201d Darrin Alves, CIO of infrastructure platforms at JPMorgan Chase, told CIO Dive. \u201cIf you wait until you're only a year or two away, you won't have the capacity available when you need it.\u201d\n\nAlves oversees the digital systems that connect more than 600 JPMorgan offices globally and over 5,000 individual branch locations to a complex hybrid ecosystem of private data centers, colocation facilities and hyperscaler deployments.\n\n\u201cWe have everything from mainframe to quantum computers and blockchain to public cloud and generative AI,\u201d Alves said.\n\nLike cloud before it, generative AI is transforming banking processes, as coding assistants help unlock data in legacy COBOL applications, smarter chatbots improve customer experience and agentic solutions ease workflow processes.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is an industry leader in AI adoption. The company widely rolled out its in-house generative AI assistant LLM Suite last September and ranked first for AI maturity in Evident Insights\u2019 analysis of the sector\u2019s top 50 financial institutions last year.\n\nModernization investments are integral to AI success going forward, Alexandra Mousavizadeh, co-founder and CEO of Evident, said.\n\n\u201cWhether banks are building their own AI or buying third-party solutions, the end result will only be as good as the underlying infrastructure,\u201d said Mousavizadeh. \u201cAs the drive towards organizationwide AI deployment ratchets up, we\u2019ll start to see which institutions have placed the right bets.\u201d\n\nComputing capacity\n\nMajor transformations call for rigorous planning and a modernized infrastructure foundation. There are multiple challenges to surmount, especially in banking.\n\n\u201cAnytime you go through an application, you first have to solve for legal and compliance,\u201d Alves said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to meet our security and risk and controls and then it's customer experience.\u201d\n\nInfrastructure and spending are also key considerations, though they are further down the decision tree.\n\n\u201cWe have to decide where it\u2019s going to fit into our architecture and the last step is to optimize for cost,\u201d said Alves.\n\nVirtual event / Free to access Generative AI - Where Are We Now?, from the editorial team at CIO Dive. Go deeper with an exclusive virtual event,, from the editorial team at CIO Dive. Learn more \u2794\n\nFinding the right compute environment and the capacity to run generative AI use cases became an enterprise pain point last year as hyperscalers raced to deploy GPU servers and build out data centers.\n\nIn August, CBRE analysts estimated that nearly 80% of data center space under construction had already been leased. Gartner forecasted 40% of existing AI data centers will be operationally constrained by power shortages in the next two years.\n\n\u201cAI expansion is putting constraints on the entire supply chain for data centers,\u201d said Alves.\n\nJPMorgan Chase navigated around the hardware hurdles proactively.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a company that wants to make sure we can control our own destiny, for our own business reasons and for regulatory reasons,\u201d Alves said. \u201cSo, we partner closely with the hardware manufacturers and the colocation and data center designers.\u201d\n\nThe bank is also vigilant about refreshing its data center infrastructure regularly, as it expands capacity where needed and leverages public cloud.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re on a continuous refresh cycle, we can accommodate significant growth without having to expand,\u201d Alves said. \u201cThe most efficient data center that you can build is the one that you don't [have to build].\u201d\n\nHybrid equilibrium\n\nWhile cloud remains a cornerstone of JPMorgan\u2019s IT strategy, the bank retains a diversified infrastructure portfolio and invests broadly in solutions.\n\n\u201cYou use the right tool for the right job,\u201d Alves said.\n\nFirmwide, the company increased tech spend by $1.5 billion year over year to roughly $17 billion in 2024, Barnum said during a May presentation to investors. CEO Jamie Dimon said JPMorgan Chase would have three-quarters of its data and 70% of its applications migrated by the end of last year.\n\n\u201cWe were methodical in our approach to cloud, so we didn't go too quickly,\u201d Alves said. \u201cAs we went, we learned that you need to be very thoughtful about which workloads make sense in public cloud.\u201d\n\nCertain banking applications align with on-prem capabilities, while others do not, depending on their function, data needs and scaling requirements.\n\nIn some cases, a modernized mainframe is the right call.\n\n\u201cWe process more than 10 trillion dollars in payments a day on our systems,\u201d Alves said. \u201cWhile there are other systems that participate in that, the mainframes are the workhorse that do the bulk of the heavy lifting.\u201d\n\nDeveloping AI solutions called for a different strategy. Initiatives were launched in the cloud, where piloting potential use cases was relatively easy and affordable. Now, as trial-and-error leads to practical applications, Alves expects to adopt a hybrid mix of infrastructure to support AI.\n\n\u201cThe cloud gives us a place to do that experimental learning with no regrets,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it doesn't work, we can shut it down very quickly. You can't really do that on your own infrastructure if you're making a significant investment in what AI requires.\u201d",

            "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM).\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.96, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 25 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.96 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 25 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 52% and 8% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for JPM\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for JPMorgan Chase & Co. here>>>\n\n\n\nThe ABR suggests buying JPMorgan Chase & Co., but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs JPM Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for JPMorgan Chase & Co., the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 6.3% over the past month to $17.82.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for JPMorgan Chase & Co. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for JPMorgan Chase & Co. may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2024. While not all picks can be winners, previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.\n\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "All renderings courtesy of Streetsense\n\nThe largest office-to-residential conversion in the country officially began leasing in the Financial District. The former 1960s office tower at 25 Water Street, once home to JPMorgan Chase and the New York Daily News, is now a luxury apartment building with 1,320 homes and 100,000 square feet of amenities, following a two-year redevelopment designed by CetraRuddy. Dubbed \u201cSoMA,\u201d for its location in \u201cSouth Manhattan,\u201d according to a press release, the rental is the first to take advantage of the 467-m tax break, a new incentive for converting offices to residential space.\n\n25 Water Street in 2023. Photo by SnowFire on Wikimedia\n\nThe brick Brutalist building, originally known as 4 New York Plaza, was built in the late 1960s as an operations center for the bank Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. Since the building mostly held computers, windows were not an important part of the structure; it was designed to look like a punch card.\n\nAfter flooding from Hurricane Sandy damaged the building in 2012, tenants like JPMorgan Chase and the Daily News did not return for a year. In 2020, the newspaper closed its newsroom and JPMorgan cut back its presence at the building preparing to move to new headquarters at 270 Park Avenue.\n\nDevelopers GFP Real Estate, Metro Loft, and Rockwood Capital bought the building in 2022 with plans to convert the 22-story office tower into apartments. As part of the $800 million redevelopment, two light wells have been carved out at the center of the building, to allow in natural light and air, and a large portion of the facade has been removed and replaced with windows. A 10-story overbuild was added to bring the height of the building to 32 stories.\n\nThe 1,320 luxury units range from studios to three-bedroom apartments, as well as a collection of penthouses at the top of the building. Apartments feature home offices, soaring ceilings, custom Italian kitchens with paneled appliances, in-unit washer-dryers, custom solar shades, and water views.\n\nAccording to the rental\u2019s newly launched website, pricing for the apartments starts at $3,436/month for a studio. According to Bloomberg, three bedrooms will go for about $10,000/month, with higher-floor apartments closer to $12,000/month.\n\nAbout a quarter of the units will be designated affordable, a requirement of the 467-m tax incentive approved by the state last year.\n\nCompass Development Marketing Group is the project\u2019s exclusive leasing and marketing partner.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re well acquainted with the practice of adapting underutilized and vacant office and commercial structures into elevated residential offerings, SoMA presented a singular opportunity through its sheer scale,\u201d Nathan Berman, founder of Metro Loft, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe site and location possessed such great potential, making it a challenge worth undertaking. There is no other location in the surrounding area where you can live with such impressive water and skyline views within the context of such expertly crafted homes and communal spaces.\u201d\n\nResidents can access 100,000 square feet of amenities, including common perks like a fitness center, spa, and co-working spaces as well as more unique offerings like a private bowling alley and a karaoke room. There\u2019s also a rooftop terrace, an on-site basketball court, two pickleball courts, and two swimming pools.\n\nThe \u201cSoMA Spa\u201d offers a steam room, Himalayan salt room, infrared sauna, relaxation room, and treatment rooms.\n\n\u201cAs architects who have planned and designed residential conversions across New York City for nearly four decades, it\u2019s no exaggeration to say that SoMa is a unique and completely unprecedented project in both scale and vision,\u201d John Cetra, founding principal of CetraRuddy, said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to be a part of the team responsible for this building\u2019s transformation. From the pioneering use of new tax incentives, to its impressive technical and design solutions and the unequaled residential experience in one of Manhattan\u2019s best locations, SoMa sets a higher standard for what\u2019s possible in giving new life to former office buildings. People across the country and around the globe will be looking at this project as the new paradigm.\u201d\n\nSeveral office-to-residential conversions are completed, underway, or planned for the Financial District as its transformation into a live-work neighborhood continues. In addition to 25 Water Street, residential conversions at 55 Broad Street, 77 Water Street, 160 Water Street, 111 Wall Street, and 1 Wall Street are expected to add roughly 5,000 new homes to the area.\n\nWhile SoMA is currently the largest completed office-to-residential conversion in the country, the conversion of Pfizer\u2019s former headquarters in Midtown will have it beat upon its completion, with more than 1,500 apartments expected to hit the market next year.\n\nRELATED:",

That was a major factor in HeyMama\u2019s interest in the sale, Luzio says.\n\n\"This is about membership and community,\" Luzio says. \"Their desire is to have more community, more programming, and more content.\" HeyMama is unlikely to be Luzio\u2019s last acquisition as she looks to continue to build and scale Luminary. She always has a list of businesses she\u2019d like to acquire under the right circumstances, something she advises of other small business owners.\n\nThat said, Luzio has a particular vision for Luminary\u2019s future. Though other women\u2019s coworking spaces like The Wing have failed to live up to the initial hype, Luzio sees a clear path forward for Luminary, one predicated on providing community, inclusivity, education, and mentorship to professional women. And one that is built on the company\u2019s \u201cown roadmap\u201d and scaled strategically.",

            "content": "JPMorgan's London HQ at 25 Bank Street, centre left\n\nWhile some large banks like HSBC are trimming their office footprints, looking for less but better-quality space, one bank seems absolutely insatiable right now.\n\nU.S. giant JPMorgan Chase is in talks to lease about 150K SF at the 1 Cabot Square office building in Canary Wharf, Bloomberg reported. That is because it is running out of space at 25 Bank Street, its nearby 1.1M SF London headquarters.\n\nThe 540K SF 1 Cabot Square is owned by the Qatar Investment Authority and leased to Credit Suisse, but it is currently empty. After a March 2023 deal to acquire its distressed Swiss rival, UBS moved Credit Suisse staff to its 700K SF UK base at Broadgate in the City of London.\n\nJPMorgan, which employs 12,000 people in London, became the sweetheart of the office real estate world earlier this year when it said it would be bringing staff back to the office five days a week, though this expansion predates that mandate, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe space JPMorgan would lease is likely to be on a temporary basis. The bank has launched a review of its long-term real estate needs, and options include refurbishing the 25 Bank Street tower it owns or building a new office on another site it owns on the Canary Wharf estate known as Riverside South, Reuters reported.\n\nJPMorgan's total office requirement is likely to be between 1.5M SF and 2M SF, according to Reuters. One option that seems remote is for JPMorgan to follow the likes of HSBC and move from Canary Wharf to the City. That is because there are unlikely to be any development sites that could house a building large enough for its requirement.\n\nJPMorgan bought the Riverside South site, which offers enough space for a 2M SF office to be built, for \u00a3237M in 2008. At that point, the City and Canary Wharf were competing fiercely to win the bank as a tenant. It bought 25 Bank Street from Canary Wharf Group for \u00a3495M in 2010.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The nation\u2019s biggest office-to-residential conversion is hitting the market with 1,300 apartments carved from a million-square-foot brick fortress originally built to house computers \u2014 and not much else.\n\nAfter a two-year transformation, the 55-year-old building in Manhattan\u2019s financial district \u2014 used for years to process checks, money transfers and other paperwork for Manufacturers Hanover Trust and then later, for back-office staff at its successor bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co. \u2014 is now unrecognizable.\n\nBroad swaths of intricate brickwork that separated the few windows marking the fa\u00e7ade of 25 Water St. have been removed and replaced with, well, windows.\n\nThe building\u2019s remaining reddish-brown bricks \u2014 carefully selected by the original designers to match historic buildings that once stood nearby \u2014 are now white. Two light wells have been carved from floor plates measuring more than 40,000 square feet (3,716 square-meters), and ten stories have been placed on top. Inside, 100,000 square feet of amenities including pickleball courts, a pool, a gym, and spa, have been dug out from a basement that once served as a cafeteria for bank employees.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a decades-old evolution of the area, accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic that decimated demand for old, outdated office space. Tower vacancies in the district are still among the highest in New York, but the condos and rentals that have filled some of their empty shells have fueled a population boom like none other in Manhattan.\n\n\u201cCreating light and air where there isn\u2019t any, and creating the number of units that were created, it\u2019s just mind boggling,\u201d Nathan Berman, founder of Metro Loft, one of the project\u2019s developers, said in an interview. \u201cDownstairs, they\u2019ve created, basically, a private Chelsea Piers.\u201d\n\nThe brutalist structure, with narrow bands of inset windows placed at irregular intervals (a pattern thought to imitate an IBM punch card), was unfriendly by design. \u201cComputers cannot look out of windows,\u201d The Architectural Forum wrote in a 1970 article about the building, which was also known as 4 New York Plaza. The machines\u2019 air conditioning demands made windows \u201cdistinct liabilities,\u201d the magazine wrote.\n\nThe building changed hands through a series of bank mergers that eventually formed JPMorgan. The bank sold the building during the financial crisis but continued to lease it, using it for staff across legal teams and other lines of business in non-customer facing roles. They were eventually moved to offices in midtown or Brooklyn as part of JPMorgan\u2019s effort to have people closer together, according to a company spokesman.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s lease was set to expire in 2025 and the building, which until the pandemic also housed the newsroom for The Daily News, was about 70% leased when it sold again in 2022 for $251 million to Metro Loft, Rockwood Capital and GFP Real Estate. After the pandemic, occupancy was around 10% or less, according to GFP executive Brian Steinwurtzel.\n\n\u201cThe building had to either be torn down or retrofitted for a new life,\u201d said Bradley Gerla, executive vice president at CBRE Group Inc., who was a broker for the building a few years before it was sold. \u201cThere was no reuse for that building.\u201d\n\nThe developers, individually behind 25 other conversions in the city, obtained a $536 million loan for the acquisition of the building, its existing debt and the cost of conversion. They struck a deal with JPMorgan to exit the lease.\n\nA tower of this size \u2014 with 1,320 units in dozens of layouts ranging from studios to three bedrooms, tenant parking, a rooftop and co-working spaces \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be economically feasible to rebuild from the ground up, particularly when considering the time and permitting required to do so, Steinwurtzel said. New construction of this kind runs about $1,000 per square foot, according to architect John Cetra, who oversaw the project. That would amount to about $1 billion for a building the size of 25 Water St.\n\nRents will range from more than $3,000-a-month for a studio to about $10,000 for three-bedroom apartments, not including an undisclosed amenity fee. Monthly rent for the higher-floor apartments, which will be ready to rent in a few months, will near $12,000. A quarter of the apartments are planned to be offered at reduced rates through an affordable housing program approved by the state last year in exchange for tax abatements, according to Steinwurtzel.\n\nTwo blocks from Battery Park, four from major subway lines and around the corner from the FDR Drive, the building \u2014 rebranded as SoMA for South Manhattan \u2014 is set back on a wide avenue, giving three of its sides uninterrupted views.\n\nStairwells that once occupied precious corner real estate were moved into the center of the building. Cetra designed more than 70 different layouts to fit a variety of renter needs. They include custom Italian kitchens with paneled appliances, washer and dryer, solar shades and high-speed WiFi.\n\n\u201cEverything has some value, but the highest value was to convert it to a residential building,\u201d said CBRE\u2019s Gerla. \u201cIt was not going to survive the way it was.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Natalie Wong and Katherine Chiglinsky.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

Texas has been one of the most active states in anti-ESG initiatives, with actions including having several asset managers placed on a list for potential divestment for allegedly \u201cboycotting\u201d energy companies, and more recently launching a multi-state lawsuit against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, accusing the asset managers of using their positions in climate-focused investment initiatives to manipulate energy markets.\n\nIn the weeks following the election, each of the firms targeted by the new letter announced withdrawals from climate-focused investment and finance coalitions, including the Net-Zero Banking Association (NZBA) and the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative.\n\nWhile the letter states that the AGs \u201capplaud you for terminating your relationships\u201d with the NZBA, NZAM and climate-focused engagement network Climate Action 100+ (CA100+), the AGs added that \u201cwe still want answers\u201d to decisions made by the firms while they were members of the groups, and accused the firms of potential legal violations through their support for net zero-focused shareholder resolutions and engagement practices.\n\nThe letter added that statements made by some of the firms reiterating their net zero commitments after leaving the groups \u201craise serious concerns as to whether your exodus is an optics-only effort.\u201d\n\nThe letter also warns the firms of potential legal actions related to their DEI policies, including \u201cdiscriminatory employment quotas,\u201d such as BlackRock\u2019s use of DEI goals in employee performance reviews and bonus considerations, \u201cdiscriminatory board quotas,\u201d citing BlackRock\u2019s proxy voting guideline that encourages large companies to have boards with \u201cat least two women and a director who identifies as a member of an underrepresented group\u201d as an example, and \u201cdiscriminatory supplier quotas,\u201d such as Goldman Sachs\u2019 goal to \u201cspend a cumulative $1.5 billion with small and diverse vendors between 2023 and 2025.\u201d\n\nThe letter includes a series of questions for each firm regarding their ESG and DEI policies, requesting responses within 45 days as an \u201copportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,\u201d and to \u201cdemonstrate whether violations have occurred, whether they will continue, and the necessity of enforcement actions to vindicate federal or State laws.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released alongside the letter, Texas AG Paxton said:\n\n\u201cBanks and financial institutions are finally starting to realize that the ESG and DEI policies pushed by radical activist groups are bad for consumers and potentially violate the law. Unlawful race- and sex-based quotas and so-called \u2018green energy\u2019 schemes will not be allowed to stand and I will continue to urge these organizations to uphold the legal obligations they owe to consumers and investors.

            "content": "JPMorgan Chase & Co. ((JPM)) has held its Q4 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. recently held an earnings call showcasing a robust financial performance, marked by record-breaking revenue and net income. The general sentiment was overwhelmingly positive, driven by significant growth in investment banking and asset management, alongside improved expense management. However, challenges like deposit margin compression and higher credit costs were acknowledged, yet the positive aspects dominated, indicating a strong outlook for future growth.\n\nRecord-Breaking Revenue and Net Income\n\nJPMorgan Chase reported a net income of $14 billion for the quarter and a full-year net income of $54 billion, with an EPS of $18.22. This remarkable performance was seen across all segments, underscoring the firm\u2019s robust financial health and its ability to generate strong earnings consistently.\n\nStrong Revenue Growth\n\nThe company achieved a revenue of $43.7 billion for the quarter, marking a 10% increase year-on-year. This growth was largely driven by higher asset management fees, investment banking fees, and increased market revenue, highlighting the firm\u2019s versatile income streams.\n\nInvestment Banking Success\n\nInvestment banking proved to be a standout segment, with fees rising by 49% year-on-year. Advisory fees increased by 41%, and underwriting fees saw significant growth, reflecting the favorable market conditions and the firm\u2019s strategic positioning.\n\nRecord Asset and Wealth Management Inflows\n\nThe firm reported record long-term net inflows of $234 billion, with assets under management reaching $4 trillion. Client assets rose to $5.9 trillion, both reflecting an 18% increase year-on-year, showcasing the strength and appeal of JPMorgan\u2019s wealth management offerings.\n\nImproved Expense Management\n\nJPMorgan demonstrated effective cost management, with expenses declining by $1.7 billion or 7% year-on-year, excluding the previous year\u2019s FDIC special assessment. This indicates the firm\u2019s emphasis on efficiency and operational discipline.\n\nPositive Outlook for Investment Banking\n\nThe firm expressed optimism about its investment banking segment, citing positive momentum and a strong pipeline. This optimism is bolstered by the segment\u2019s recent successes and the favorable market conditions expected to continue.\n\nDeposit Margin Compression\n\nThere were challenges noted in deposit margin compression, with NII excluding Markets down by $548 million or 2%, due to lower rates. This impacted revenue within the Banking & Wealth Management divisions, highlighting a key area of pressure for the firm.\n\nChallenges in Loan Growth\n\nLoan growth faced hurdles, as Global Corporate and Investment Banking loans decreased by 2% quarter-on-quarter, with commercial real estate loans remaining flat. This was due to paydowns offsetting new originations, pointing to challenges in expanding the loan book.\n\nHigher Credit Costs\n\nCredit costs rose to $2.6 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $2.4 billion and a net reserve build of $267 million. This increase was largely due to higher card revolving balances, indicating a cautious stance on credit risk management.\n\nGuidance for 2025 Financial Outlook\n\nLooking ahead, JPMorgan Chase provided solid guidance for 2025, expecting net interest income excluding Markets to be around $90 billion, with overall NII reaching approximately $94 billion. Despite anticipated modest compression in deposit margins, growth is expected post-mid-year 2025. Expenses for 2025 are projected at about $95 billion, emphasizing investments in new products and technology. The firm maintains a strong capital position with a CET1 ratio of 15.7% and intends to adjust capital return strategies through share buybacks to manage excess capital effectively.\n\nIn summary, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings call highlighted a strong financial performance, with positive sentiment fueled by record revenues and strategic growth in key areas like investment banking and wealth management. Despite some challenges, the firm\u2019s outlook remains optimistic, supported by solid forward guidance and strategic financial management.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nIn response to external attacks on DEI at big-name financial firms, JPMorgan Chase CEO and Chair Jamie Dimon had a few choice words regarding the activists: \u201cBring them on.\u201d\n\nThe comments were made Wednesday on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d program, filmed at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThis comes shortly after President Donald Trump\u2019s two-day cascade of executive orders \u2014 including several that dismantle or seek to dismantle DEI initiatives \u2014 following his inauguration on Monday.\n\nThe forum correspondent asked Dimon about \u201ca rebuke of ESG, a rebuke of DEI\u201d spearheaded by conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck.\n\n\u201cYou now have a couple of activists going after your company,\u201d the interviewer said.\n\n\u201cReally? Not that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Dimon responded. When the interviewer pushed him, Dimon said, \u201cWell, bring them on.\u201d\n\nStanding by DEI, despite executive orders\n\nTrump has signed at least five executive orders that pertain to DEI in both the public and private sector:\n\nThe topic of executive orders came up during the conversation with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s CEO.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t like monikers and it makes it sound like it\u2019s a binary thing of what you do,\u201d Dimon said at one point. He outlined what JPMorgan Chase does and has \u201calways done.\u201d\n\nWhile some policies may change, he acknowledged, the firm has long followed its own map.\n\nFor example, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve always done our own thing in climate. So we get criticized by people on the left and the right about climate. We\u2019ve financed the biggest oil and gas companies \u2014 who\u2019ve done a great job reducing their CO2, by the way. We\u2019re the biggest financer of solar and wind.\u201d\n\nAdding to his illustrations of arguable contradictions, Dimon said, \u201cWe are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community [...] And wherever I go, red states, blue states, green states, mayors, governors [...] they like what we do.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to pander to any which side or any which thing.\u201d\n\nESG Dive sister publication HR Dive reached out to JPMorgan Chase for additional comment. A spokesperson pointed to Dimon\u2019s previous statements on diversity and inclusion efforts. The document, published in 2023, highlights the firm\u2019s commitment to business resource groups and community outreach for Black people, women, veterans and people with disabilities.\n\n\u201cThis approach is integral to what we do, in great scale, around the world \u2014 and it works,\u201d Dimon said at the time. \u201cWe are quite clear that whether our efforts are inspired by the goodness of our hearts (as philanthropy or venture-type investing) or good business, we try to measure the actual outcomes.\u201d",

The expansion of alternatives into the private wealth market has also led to a rise in semi-liquid structures, which typically rely on secondaries to source liquidity and invest.\n\nPrivate Equity:\n\nPro-Growth Policies: U.S. tax reform and deregulation are anticipated to enhance corporate profitability, reviving IPOs, M&A, and lending activities.

            "content": "Even as it develops a gleaming skyscraper across the street, JPMorgan Chase is planning to polish up its soon-to-be-former headquarters along Manhattan's Madison Avenue to accommodate the banking giant's growing workforce.\n\nAlongside recent news calling employees back to a full, five-day work schedule, the New York-based company is preparing to renovate its 383 Madison Ave. tower, adding to the firm's office investments both in the city and elsewhere across the country. The 1.2 million-square-foot tower is within steps of JPMorgan's future headquarters at 270 Park Ave., a more than $3 billion development that's on track for completion later this year.\n\narticle 3 Min Read JPMorgan prepares to call workers back full time, shedding pandemic-era flexibility The nation's largest bank is set to join other corporate employers with an expanded in-person requirement. Katie Burke Social\n\n\u201cWith more than 17,500 employees working in Manhattan across a number of corporate office locations, we are always reviewing our long-term real estate options in Manhattan, especially as we move toward opening our new global headquarters at 270 Park,\u201d a JPMorgan spokesperson said in an emailed statement to CoStar News.\n\nJPMorgan, the largest bank in the United States, is expected to kick off renovations on the Madison Avenue property once work on the 70-story, 2.5 million-square-foot headquarters project is complete.\n\nJPMorgan's future Manhattan headquarters tower at 270 Park Ave. is set to be stocked with high-end amenities and features. (JPMorgan Chase)\n\nThe bank has made a number of significant investments in its physical real estate since it broke ground on its Park Avenue headquarters in early 2021, underscoring the importance JPMorgan has long placed on in-person work.\n\nEarlier this month it told all employees they'd be required to return to an office five days a week, marking the end of a pandemic-era policy that allowed some to work on a hybrid schedule.\n\nThe escalated policy, which takes effect in March, has meant the bank is scrambling to boost capacity across its portfolio of offices to accommodate the full return of all of its employees. JPMorgan's operating committee said in a recent memo, earlier reported by Bloomberg, that employees will be notified before the end of the month whether certain offices have the space necessary for everyone to begin to fill them back up.\n\n\u201cWe know that a lot has changed in our workplaces since returning to the office after the pandemic and recognize that it will take us some time to get all of our locations ready to accommodate a five-day-a-week schedule,\u201d JPMorgan said in the memo. \u201cWe know that some of you prefer a hybrid schedule and respectfully understand that not everyone will agree with this decision. We think it is the best way to run the company.\u201d\n\nFull-scale return\n\nThat commitment to physical office space has rippled across the country as JPMorgan has signed several large renewal deals, expanded regional offices and spent hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire more property.\n\nLast year it closed a roughly $320.2 million deal with developer Hines to acquire 250 Park Ave., an office tower across the street from its headquarters development. It signed major new and renewal agreements in Southern California, New York City, Dallas and New Jersey, according to CoStar data, and is currently finalizing a deal to expand its longtime San Francisco hub in the JPMorgan Chase Building at 560 Mission St.\n\nIf realized, that agreement would boost the bank's footprint in the 31-story tower up to about 280,000 square feet, an increase of about 30%.\n\narticle 2 Min Read JPMorgan to expand San Francisco office as it calls workers back The nation's largest bank has signed a renewal deal as part of efforts to consolidate employees within its real estate. Rachel Scheier Social\n\nFrom corporate giants to smaller professional services firms, employers across the country are stepping up their in-person requirements in an attempt to move past the pandemic-related shift toward increased flexible work arrangements. Office market stakeholders point to the escalated mandates, many of which take effect this year, as a signal that demand for office space will be on the rebound after years of depressed leasing activity.\n\nLarge employers such as Amazon, Starbucks, AT&T, Southwest Airlines and Walmart have recently stepped up their in-person requirements, and some employers are now demanding workers commute to an office all five days of the workweek.\n\nEscalated mandates have fueled optimism among national office landlords looking to retain their portfolio occupancy as tenants slashed real estate to both trim costs and adjust to flexible, post-pandemic work policies.\n\nThe combination of depressed demand, stagnant leasing and ongoing flexible work has helped push the national office vacancy rate to a record high of about 14%, according to CoStar data. Tenants have collectively handed back roughly 210 million square feet of office space since the start of 2020 with tepid demand expected to prolong any effort to revert to pre-pandemic levels of occupancy.\n\nGrowing presence\n\nFor JPMorgan, the push to boost in-person attendance is critical given its string of large investments to expand its office real estate portfolio.\n\nThe bank is one of New York City's largest employers and was one of the first to mandate a return to the office for its U.S. workforce in 2021, albeit on a hybrid schedule.\n\nWith its new headquarters nearing the finish line and its planned renovations along Madison Avenue, JPMorgan is also among a cohort of companies aiming to make the office a commute-worthy destination. At 270 Park Ave., for example, the skyscraper's roughly 14,000 employees are set to have access to a slew of amenities such as outdoor lounges, a fitness center, a meditation room and an upscale food hall.\n\nEmployees at the soon-to-be-renovated 383 Madison Ave. tower \u2014 a property JPMorgan acquired through its takeover of Bear Stearns at the height of the Great Recession \u2014 could get a similar boost of perks. The bank has brought on Foster and Partners, the same design firm as its Park Avenue headquarters project, to spearhead the renovation.\n\nThe bank declined to provide additional comments or details about its Madison Avenue plans.\n\nJPMorgan occupies upward of 27 million square feet of office space around the world, according to CoStar data, a footprint spread across more than 700 outposts.",

            "content": "The 43rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference (JPM), which took place Jan. 13 through 16 in San Francisco, is one of the largest healthcare investment symposiums in the industry, connecting global industry leaders, emerging fast-growth companies, innovative technology creators, and members of the investment community.\n\nBelow are three key topics that emerged from conversations on the ground floor.\n\nRadiotherapy on the rise\n\nSponsored Post How PDPM Optimization Improves Facility Financial Performance Transitioning to PDPM models significantly shifted the healthcare industry. By replacing the RUG system, healthcare providers cut waste and more accurately reflect the care each patient received.\n\nRadiotherapy was a key focus among attendees. Radiotherapy, also known as radiation therapy, uses targeted radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. The radiotherapy market is growing rapidly due to a focus on advancements in radiotherapy treatment technologies, a growing cancer patient population, the increasing use of particle therapy for cancer treatment and increased initiatives to promote radiotherapy awareness, according to a December 2024 report from MarketsandMarkets, a market research firm. The report concluded that the global radiotherapy market is projected to grow from $7.21 billion in 2024 to $9.62 billion by 2030, a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) during the growth period of 4.9%.\n\nMany investors and strategic partners were already aware of the clinical and commercial importance of radiotherapy in the oncology space, but this awareness has been heightened by positive study results, new FDA approvals, and growing commercial traction following the clinical and commercial successes of radiopharmaceuticals such as Lutathera and Pluvicto and the increase in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity. Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate) has demonstrated promise as part of the initial therapy for some neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and is the first radioactive drug approved to treat these rare tumors. Pluvicto (lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan) is a radioactive drug that has demonstrated significant benefits in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. A wave of radiopharmaceutical companies has arisen to offer competition to Lutathera and Pluvicto in those two indications. With regard to M&A activity, TaylorWessing, a global law firm specializing in technology and life sciences, has identified therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals for oncology indications as a treatment modality that has recently built up \u201creal traction in the market.\u201d Examples include RayzeBio, acquired in 2024 by Bristol Myers Squibb, and POINT Biopharma, acquired in late 2023 by Eli Lilly & Co. The uptick in M&A activity is also fueling investments, as funds from successful exits are being reinvested into newer companies.\n\nChina\u2019s biotech surge\n\nAnother theme of the conference was the appetite of U.S. pharmaceutical companies for deals with China. More than a third of therapeutic molecules purchased by U.S. pharma companies in 2024 were sourced from China, compared to zero four years ago. That striking statistic is from Stifel\u2019s Biopharmaceutical Outlook for 2025 report, released earlier this month. These deals were larger than average and three or four or more involved partnerships or whole new companies forming around a China-developed asset. Moreover, a Chinese company is involved in at least a fifth of development programs across the entire industry\u2019s total clinical pipeline, according to a 2025 preview report from Evaluate Pharma. Venture companies are following suit, launching U.S. startups around Chinese-sourced compounds. Historically, Chinese deals have focused on oncology, but pharmaceutical company prospecting has broadened to include obesity, immunology and cardiometabolic diseases.\n\nStimulated by government investment in biotech R&D, efforts to make its business climate more biotech-hospitable, and an influx of U.S. and European-trained scientists, China\u2019s biotech boom is threatening the global dominance of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry and raising concerns about its reliance on Chinese R&D for new drugs. An example cited in BioPharma Dive is ivonescimab, a drug developed by China-based Akeso and licensed by U.S.-based Summit Therapeutics. Recent results from a lung cancer study conducted in China showed that ivonescimab outperformed Keytruda. Manufactured by Merck, Keytruda is its dominant immunotherapy and is currently the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s most lucrative product. Boris Za\u00eftra, head of business development at Roche, which sells a rival to Keytruda, was quoted as saying that the finding \u201cput a huge focus on what\u2019s happening in China.\u201d\n\nWhether the trend will hold is a matter of speculation, but in the meanwhile, it serves as a warning to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry that it is facing some stiff competition when it comes to innovation.\n\nAI and drug discovery\n\nThough AI\u2019s role in drug discovery has yet to play out, the enormous potential upside in terms of savings of time, resources, and money was of great interest to conference participants. A 2024 study in JAMA Network Open, for instance, found that the mean cost of bringing a drug to market from 2000 to 2018 was $172.7 million (in 2018 dollars) in a process that typically takes 10 to 15 years. Even small improvements in these numbers would be a boon to drug discovery and patient health. In particular, participants shared their hopes that AI will help cut the failure rate for new drugs. Despite the significant investments mentioned above, about 90% of drugs in clinical development still fail. When the cost of failures was included in the JAMA Network Open study, the cost of bringing a drug to market increased to $518.8 million and, when both drug development failure and capital costs were included, to $879.3 million, or about $1.1 billion in today\u2019s dollars.\n\nThe huge amounts of data amassed by pharmaceutical companies over decades are ripe for mining by AI companies, many of whom are partnering with big pharmaceutical companies in the discovery and design of new small molecules. At the conference, the tech giant NVIDIA, the world\u2019s most valuable company, for example, announced new partnerships to transform the healthcare and life sciences industry by using AI to speed clinical trials by reducing administrative burden, advancing drug discovery and enhancing genomic research. The partnerships announced included those with IQVIA, a global provider of clinical research services, commercial insights and healthcare intelligence to the life sciences and healthcare industries; Illumina, a global leader in DNA sequencing and informatics technologies; and Arc Institute, a research organization operating at the intersection of biology and machine learning.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images, 501972854\n\nRaphi Levy Raphi Levy specializes in corporate finance and strategy and has served as Alpha Tau\u2019s CFO since 2019, after spending 13 years working in the investment banking division at Goldman Sachs in New York and Tel Aviv.

Investors can gain exposure to the stock via iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF IYG.\n\nIn fact, major firms like Alphabet Inc. GOOG GOOGL, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS, are pushing for a return to office (RTO) policies, despite widespread resistance from employees.\n\nWorkers at these companies have voiced frustrations, some even resorting to petitions or quitting in protest, Fortune adds.\n\nThe Future of Work: Can Remote Work Gain Ground?\n\nA study found that employees working from home two days a week are just as productive as those in the office every day, Forbes reports, citing a survey from Resume.org. Despite this, 28% of business leaders plan to enforce 100% in-person work by 2025, while only 2% will allow less than one office day per week.\n\nAs the future of work evolves, Veeva\u2019s focus on employee happiness and productivity through remote work continues to set the company apart in an increasingly competitive labor market.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDoug Ford Takes on Trump: Ontario Premier Threatens Swift Retaliation in Trade War\n\nImage: Shutterstock",

            "content": "JPMorgan Chase says ongoing inflation and an outlook for sharply lower returns for investors means that retirees should toss the long-standing 4% rule. That\u2019s the rule that says retirees can safely draw down their savings by 4% per year without having to worry that they\u2019ll run out of funds before they die. Failure to toss this rule could mean having to cut back on your spending or even seeing your savings disappear. Instead the big bank advises drawing down no more than 2% or 3% of your nest egg each year. Consider working with a financial advisor as you plan for a worry-free retirement.\n\nWhat Is the 4% Rule\n\nThe 4% rule was first articulated in 1994 by financial planner Bill Bengen. It calls for spending 4% of your retirement savings in the first year of your retirement and then adjusting that percentage each year for inflation. Doing that would have kept retirees from running out of money in every 30-year period since 1926, even when economic conditions were at their worst, according to Bengen.\n\nFor example, a retiree with $1 million in savings would withdraw $40,000 in the first year of his or her retirement. Because all subsequent withdrawals are adjusted for inflation, the same retiree would withdraw $41,200 in their second year of retirement if inflation was 3%.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Time to Toss the 4% Rule\n\nHere's How Much JPMorgan Says You Can Pull From Your Retirement Accounts Yearly\n\nEarlier this year, however, Bengen said the 4% rule needs to be tossed. And the reasons for doing so are numerous. For one thing people are living longer. According to the Social Security Administration, the average man turning 65 today can expect to live until age 84.3. His female counterpart can expect to live, on average, until age 86.6. Research has suggested that millennials may live well into their 90s and beyond, so there\u2019s even more pressure to make retirement savings stretch.\n\nThe 4% rule also doesn\u2019t take into account individual savings rates. Millennials have the lowest participation rate when it comes to saving in an employer-sponsored plan and a recent report shows that 56% of them are less likely to save for retirement outside of work. That means that a significant number of young workers could come up short in retirement.\n\nJPMorgan also advises retiring the 4% rule because of prospects for lower returns and higher inflation \u2013 \u201cthat all economists now see on the horizon\u201d \u2013 means the 4% rule could be a prescription for serious financial trouble. While the S&P 500 earned on average 10% over the last 10 years, the bank\u2019s recently published long-term capital market assumptions forecast a 60/40 portfolio returning just 4.3%.",

They had earlier received positive reviews on their performance.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it goes when you stay at a company,\u201d they said. \u201cIt just feels like a slap in the face.\u201d\n\nFor this staff member, in particular, the ordeal was \u201cvery much like a punch to the gut\u201d.\n\nThe employees\u2019 compensation pales in comparison to the pay package of CEO Jamie Dimon, who will receive $39 million: $1.5 million of which will come from his base salary and $37.5 million in incentives.\n\nKeeping mum over low pay raises\n\nBut employees are choosing to fight their battles carefully.\n\nOne employee \u2013 whose office was shuttered during the COVID crisis and who switched to remote work \u2013 no longer raised concerns over the meagre increase after they found out.\n\nTheir pay bump this year was just 2%, a low ball compared to what they had received in previous reviews.

            "content": "Donald Trump and activists are taking aim at DEI programs in government and the corporate world.\n\nFortune 500 companies, like Meta and Walmart, have begun scaling back some DEI initiatives.\n\nYet a defense of DEI by JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and leaders at Costco show the efforts aren't dead.\n\nDEI might be down, but it's not dead.\n\nOne of President Donald Trump's first executive orders upon returning to office aimed to stomp out federal DEI programs, a pledge he made on the campaign trail. Before Trump's inauguration, industry bellwethers Meta, McDonald's, and Walmart had announced plans to roll back at least some of their diversity, equity, and inclusion work.\n\nOn Friday, Target said it was ending its several programs related to diversity.\n\nYet, elsewhere in the corporate world, there are still high-profile supporters. Take Jamie Dimon. This week, the JPMorgan CEO defended the bank's DEI work as activist shareholders appear to be targeting the company, among other financial heavyweights, over their DEI programs.\n\n\"Bring them on,\" Dimon told CNBC on Wednesday in reference to the critical investors.\n\nCostco has also shown support for DEI in the days leading up to Trump's return to the Oval Office. Then, on Thursday, the retailer's shareholders overwhelmingly defeated a proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research that would have required Costco to produce a report on its DEI work \u2014 a move the board opposed as being both politically biased and a waste of resources.\n\nMany companies stepped up or talked more about their DEI efforts after the 2020 murder of George Floyd and the racial justice protests that followed.\n\nYet diversity efforts have been under attack in recent months, first by conservative activists and now by Trump, prompting many companies to reconsider their advocacy for progressive initiatives.\n\nTrump's executive order has the potential to ripple further through the private sector. The president wants federal agencies to identify \"the most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners\" across public companies and nonprofits for possible civil investigations.\n\nStill, the companies that are sticking by DEI seem unperturbed.\n\nMore innovation, smarter decisions\n\nOne of the reasons some major companies are doubling down on DEI today is because they say it's good for business.\n\nDimon, for example, said JPMorgan's efforts to reach out to the Black, Hispanic, LGBTQ+, and veterans groups, among others, were \"90% for-profit.\" He spoke to CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nIn the company's most recent annual report, issued in April, Dimon wrote that JPMorgan's work around DEI leads to \"more innovation, smarter decisions and better financial results\" for the company and the economy. A JPMorgan spokesperson declined to comment further to BI.\n\nAt Costco, 98% of shareholders voted against a measure that would have required the retailer to investigate any legal or financial risks tied to the company's DEI work. The results followed a unanimous recommendation by the board urging them to reject the proposal.\n\nThe board wrote in December that its commitment to running a business \"rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary.\" Costco did not respond to BI's request for further comment.\n\nAbout half of US residents are female, while more than 40% consider themselves non-white, according to the nonprofit USAFacts.\n\nActivists are targeting DEI programs\n\nOther companies have made pitches in favor of DEI. Apple has encouraged investors to vote against a shareholder proposal to jettison its DEI programs. In a filing this month, it criticized the petition as one that would constrain Apple's \"ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies.\"\n\nSome of that pressure from investors comes as activists, like the influencer Robby Starbuck, have pushed companies \u2014 sometimes successfully, in the case of Walmart \u2014 to alter their programs.\n\nA Walmart spokesperson told BI that the company remains committed to \"creating a culture where everyone can be successful, and ensuring we are a Walmart for everyone.\"\n\nMeta's vice president of human resources, Janelle Gale, wrote in a memo this month that the parent of Facebook and Instagram would cease to have a team focused on DEI. She also said that the term DEI had \"become charged\" because it's sometimes seen as a \"practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others.\"\n\nIn Target's announcement Friday, Kiera Fernandez, the company's chief community impact and equity officer, wrote that, as a company that sees millions of customers daily, \"we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape.\"\n\nPart of that shifting landscape, as Meta's Gale noted in her memo, involves what's legal. That reassessment follows the Supreme Court's 2023 decision ending affirmative action in college admissions. While it's not permissible to practice DEI in a way that becomes discriminatory, the Trump administration's push to weaken DEI could prompt added scrutiny of corporate programs, legal experts told BI.\n\nMeta, McDonald's, and Target didn't respond to BI's requests for further comment. Apple didn't immediately respond to an inquiry sent outside normal business hours.\n\nEven before the White House's pushback, it was already a tough political environment for DEI, which critics often assail for prioritizing gender or ethnicity over merit. In addition, some who sympathize with the aims of DEI programs contend that some of the efforts aren't effective and need to be reimagined.\n\n'A business imperative'\n\nCompanies might be convinced to stay the course on DEI because such efforts are often part of a strategy to attract and keep the best workers, Diana Scott, US human capital center leader at The Conference Board, told BI. The Conference Board describes itself as a nonpartisan, nonprofit entity. As part of its work, it operates councils for business leaders in areas including diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe majority of execs Scott talks with from the large companies that make up the think tank's membership say they plan to continue their DEI work.\n\n\"For them, it's a business imperative,\" she said.\n\nHaving a diverse workforce where the focus is on equity \u2014 things like fairness in opportunities and in how workers are rewarded \u2014 leads to better culture and collaboration, Scott said. That, in turn, drives innovation and better business results.\n\n\"People don't view this as a zero-sum game,\" she said, referring to the views on DEI among many of the business leaders she talks to.\n\nSome DEI efforts haven't been working\n\nThat support doesn't mean, however, that there aren't DEI efforts that couldn't be improved, Scott said.\n\nSome researchers agree.\n\nIris Bohnet, a behavioral economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and coauthor of the book \"Make Work Fair,\" told BI that some measures, like diversity training, too often fail to change behaviors that could be influenced by bias, such as decisions on hiring, promotions, or performance appraisals.\n\n\"What we have been doing in the past five to 10 years really hasn't been working,\" she said.\n\nThat's one reason to revisit \u2014 yet not abandon \u2014 DEI, Bohnet said. Focusing on ideas like fairness could create greater buy-in from skeptics, she said.\n\nMany workers support DEI\n\nAnother reason some employers are likely to stick with DEI is because employees often support it.\n\nIn an August survey of some 1,300 workers and executives at US companies, 58% of respondents told the Conference Board that their organization put an appropriate amount of effort into DEI. About one in five workers said their employer didn't go far enough.\n\nFor groups that have historically often faced a tough time on the job, DEI often matters a great deal. About half of women and 56% of Black workers told the Conference Board they wouldn't work for an organization that didn't regard it as important.\n\n\"Many of these companies have been practicing DEI for decades,\" Scott said. \"This is not performative for them.\"\n\nJennie Glazer, CEO of the think tank Coqual, which focuses on barriers to advancement for underrepresented people in the workplace, told BI that its members, which include big companies like JPMorgan, believe that \"inclusive\" workplaces are more effective.\n\n\"Diverse teams make better decisions and solve problems faster,\" she said.\n\nThat's why she thinks it's unlikely that many companies will ultimately abandon all of their efforts in this area.\n\n\"We are going to have a very multicultural workforce, whether or not you invest in DEI,\" she said.",

            "content": "JPMorgan Chase & Co. is the 5th largest bank in the world and the largest in the U.S. The current company is the result of a series of mergers that began in the earliest days of American banking history and include more than 1,200 original banks. The oldest predecessor is The Bank Of The Manhattan Company which was founded in 1799 by Aaron Burr. At the time, The Bank Of The Manhattan Company was the 3rd oldest bank in the U.S. and the 31st oldest in the world. The Chase Manhattan Bank, a precursor to JPMorgan Chase, was later formed when The Bank Of Manhattan Company purchased Chase Bank which was established in 1877.\n\nJPMorgan & Co came to life in 1895 in order to finance the United States Steel Corporation. Itself a result of merger, the company also financed other early American businesses as well as aided the federal government by backing a bond offering. It wasn\u2019t until the year 2000 and after several more mergers that JPMorgan Chase & Co was born. It will be four more years before the merger with Bank One which is notable because it brings CEO Jamie Dimon into the picture.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co was instrumental in aiding the US government during the 2008 financial crisis. It backed the accounts of several major banks including Bear Stearns and eventually took over their operations. Today, JPMorgan Chase & Co operates as a financial services company worldwide with operations on every continent and in more than 60 countries.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co operates through four segments that are Consumer & Community Banking (CCB), Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB), Commercial Banking (CB), and Asset & Wealth Management (AWM). Services are available in branches in 48 of the 50 US states and around the world. Services are available via ATM, online, mobile, and telephone.\n\nThe CCB segment offers traditional banking services to consumers that include but are not limited to deposits, loans, mortgages, and lines of credit. The CIB segment provides investment banking products and services to businesses, institutions, and governments that range from prime brokerage, insurance, corporate strategy, and access to capital markets, to lending, cross-border financing, and derivative instruments. The CB segment provides financial services for small, medium, and large businesses including commercial real estate banking of all types.\n\nThe AWM segment provides investment management solutions to institutional and retail investors. This segment also provides retirement products, brokerage, trusts and estates, and investment management products.",

He disagrees with some critics about the reasons why.\n\nThe claim that big banks have closed accounts held by certain political or business customers gained new visibility this week when President Donald Trump confronted Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\n\"I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives,\" Trump told Moynihan during a virtual question and answer session. The president also appeared to include Dimon in his confrontation.\n\n\"I don't know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody else, I hope you open your banks to conservatives because what you're doing is wrong,\" Trump added.\n\nBrian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. REUTERS/Yves Herman \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\n\nMoynihan did not respond to Trump\u2019s criticism in the moment, but Dimon offered his defense of debanking in a Chase podcast interview published earlier this past week.\n\nThe reason isn\u2019t politics, he said. It has to do with regulations imposed on banks by regulators in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"We have not debanked anyone because of political or religious relationships, period,\" he said.\n\nWhat Dimon instead argued is that US rules such as the Bank Secrecy Act discourage banks from dealing with customers that are considered high-risk \u2014 and that there needs to be clearer regulation on that front.\n\n\"We are responsible in the law to fight sex trafficking, money laundering, tax avoidance,\" Dimon said, and regulators \u201cput a lot of pressure on us\u201d and \u201ctell us what is high risk.\"\n\n\"If we don't debank someone and something goes wrong, it could be hundreds of millions of dollars in fines. So a lot of banks are kind of guessing, like, \u2018we should get rid of these people\u2019?\u201d\n\n\"We're not allowed to tell you why we debanked you,\u201d he added.\n\nJamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Mike Segar \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\n\nThe issue of debanking surfaced repeatedly during the 2024 presidential campaign and had perhaps its most prominent airing in the weeks after Trump\u2019s election win in early November when Silicon Valley billionaire and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen appeared on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast.\n\nDuring that interview, Andreessen claimed the Biden administration had instructed regulators to pressure banks into debanking its enemies \u2014 including closing accounts held by conservatives and startups in crypto, artificial intelligence, and other sectors.\n\nHe referred to it as \"Operation Choke Point 2.0.\" (Operation Choke Point was a program during the Obama administration designed to root out bank accounts tied to consumer fraud \u2014 a program that also attracted conservative critics).",

Goldman last week disclosed that it gave Solomon a 25.8% raise, in addition to a one-time $80 million retention bonus.\n\nDimon\u2019s pay package consists of a $1.5 million annual base salary, a $5 million cash bonus and $32.5 million in variable performance share units.\n\n\u201cDuring the year, under Mr. Dimon's stewardship, the Firm continued to serve clients and customers against a dynamic global macro backdrop characterized by ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty,\u201d JPMorgan said in its filing.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s board evaluated Dimon's leadership in developing executives, the bank\u2019s financial performance, and the CEO\u2019s commitment to shareholders, according to the filing.\n\nThe bank saw $180.6 billion in revenue in 2024, along with $58.5 billion in net income, and a 22% return on tangible common equity. The bank raised $2.8 trillion in credit and capital and maintained a 15.7% common tier 1 ratio, the board noted.\n\nAdditionally, Dimon in 2024 named Jennifer Piepszak \u2013 historically seen as a front-runner to become JPMorgan\u2019s next CEO \u2013 as co-CEO of the bank\u2019s commercial and investment bank, alongside Troy Rohrbaugh. At the same time, the bank appointed Marianne Lake to lead its consumer and community banking division.\n\nMore recently, the bank tapped Piepszak as its next chief operating officer, and elevated Doug Petno, the bank\u2019s co-head of global banking, into Piepszak\u2019s commercial and investment banking role.

However, some of his workers are unhappy with their recent bonuses.\n\nAccording to Fortune, JPMorgan managers began telling the bank's more than 300,000 global employees how much they earned in 2024 bonuses on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week. The bank is expected to pay U.S. employees the extra money next week on January 28. Annual bonuses on Wall Street have a long history, dating back to the 20th century when J.P. Morgan himself pioneered the practice by giving his employees a one-time cash gift equal to a year's salary. According to figures from the New York State Comptroller, seen by the NYPost, the average Wall Street bonus in 2023 was $176,500.\n\nThe five U.S.-based JPMorgan employees who spoke to Fortune indicated that they were disappointed with their bonuses, though some tried to look on the positive side and said they were grateful that their numbers weren't lower. These employees, who worked in divisions other than investment banking (like commercial banking and asset and wealth management), received raises ranging from 2% to 2.7%\u2014far less than the 15% raise in bonuses reportedly received by JPMorgan investment bankers.\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Isn't Worried About AI Taking Over Jobs \u2014 Here's Why\n\nJPMorgan reported its fourth quarter 2024 financial results earlier this month and stated that net income for the quarter was $14 billion, up 50% from the same time last year, while net revenue was $43.7 billion, up 10%.\n\nThe bank posted a record-high full-year 2024 net income of $58.5 billion.\n\nAll of the employees who spoke with Fortune were aware of the bank's recent record performance, with one worker stating that they felt \"disrespected and undervalued.\"\n\nOne JPMorgan employee told Fortune that they found out on Wednesday that their bonus only increased by $3,000 from last year, for a 2% raise. They took the rest of the day off from work\u2014so they wouldn't say anything negative about it.\n\nA different worker said they received outstanding reviews last year yet earned a similarly low raise.\n\n\"It just feels like a slap in the face,\" they said.\n\nOther employees complained of receiving smaller bonuses than last year.\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Wants People to 'Stop Talking' About AI: 'It'll Help You Do Your Job Better'\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan informed its staff earlier this month that it is implementing a strict return-to-office (RTO) mandate in March where almost all workers will be required to work from the office five days per week, shifting schedules for the 40% of workers who were on a hybrid schedule.\n\nThe announcement sparked internal pushback on an internal company website. More than 300 JPMorgan employees voiced concerns about how the RTO mandate would affect their commute, work-life balance, and childcare costs, prompting JPMorgan to shut down comments about the topic.\n\nRelated: JPMorgan Says Its AI Cash Flow Software Cut Human Work By Almost 90%\n\nThe RTO mandate, coupled with the recently low bonuses, has led some employees to speculate that JPMorgan wants to reduce the number of people in its workforce, per Fortune.\n\nAccording to a July survey from Bamboo HR, about a quarter of C-Suite executives hoped that strict return-to-office policies would cause employees to quit. Bamboo HR called this concept \"layoffs in disguise.\"",

            "content": "JPMorgan Chase for years understated the risk it posed to the financial system, according to a whistleblower who claimed that America\u2019s largest bank made billions of dollars by violating rules established to protect the global economy from crisis.\n\nIn a 35-page letter sent to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s board audit committee, the whistleblower, a former JPMorgan Chase banker, alleged the firm \u201cmisrepresented\u201d several indicators used to assess its complexity by the Federal Reserve by engaging in a process called \u201cnetting,\u201d which is prohibited under Fed rules and international standards. This practice made the bank appear less complex, allowing the firm to hold less capital in reserve \u2014 in effect eroding the financial buffer meant to protect against future shocks.\n\nThough the practice violates international standards, the Federal Reserve allowed JPMorgan Chase and other large U.S. banks to continue it, according to another banker familiar with the matter.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said she was deeply concerned that the Federal Reserve \u201cmay be turning a blind eye as JPMorgan and other Wall Street banks cook their books and skim off of funds meant to prevent a global economic collapse.\u201d\n\n\u201cInconsistent and lax bank supervision has crashed our economy before,\u201d she told the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism.\n\n\u201c[Federal Reserve Chair Jerome] Powell owes the American people an explanation for allowing CEOs to manipulate their financial reports so they can pay themselves and their wealthy investors more in executive compensation and buybacks.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower claimed that JPMorgan Chase was able to issue an additional $75 billion to $100 billion in loans by understating its complexity. They calculated that this could have allowed JPMorgan Chase to generate an additional $2 billion in net income in one year alone.\n\nFormer policymakers warned that the lack of proper enforcement of the rules established in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 after which taxpayers footed the bill for colossal government bailouts to stabilize the global economy \u2014 could leave large U.S. banks without the necessary capital on hand in the event of another crisis.\n\n\u201cIf [U.S. banks] don\u2019t have enough capital for times when they experience financial stress, that is putting their domestic economies at greater risk because it\u2019s eroding their ability to absorb losses,\u201d said Graham Steele, a former assistant secretary for financial institutions at the U.S. Treasury Department. \u201cIt also imposes risks to the global financial system. They will spread risk and contagion because these are global financial institutions and global markets.\u201d\n\nIn August 2023, the whistleblower wrote in the letter to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s board audit committee, which oversees the firm\u2019s financial reporting, that the bank had been misreporting complexity indicators since 2016. The whistleblower claimed they had raised the issue internally in 2018 and that they were ultimately retaliated against and laid off in 2022. According to the letter, they filed whistleblower complaints with the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2022 and briefed both agencies on the matter that year.\n\nThe indicators are part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s quarterly systemic risk report, which the U.S. regulator uses to calculate the risk posed by the eight largest American banks to the global financial system. The Federal Reserve uses the data in the report to calculate the additional capital each bank must hold above the minimum requirements set by U.S. law, which is known as the capital surcharge. The banks that pose a greater risk to the financial system are required to hold larger capital reserves.\n\nA JPMorgan Chase spokesperson did not answer a question from ICIJ and TBIJ about whether the whistleblower\u2019s description of how the firm reported these indicators was accurate. The spokesperson said in a statement that the bank fully complies with all capital regulations, and that the bank\u2019s methodology \u201cis fully transparent to our regulators.\u201d\n\nThe Basel Accord, an international set of banking standards, also prohibits netting in reporting these complexity indicators. The framework is not legally binding, but the members of the international committee that sets these standards \u2014 which includes the Federal Reserve and other U.S. institutions \u2014 have agreed to fully implement them in their jurisdictions.\n\nA Federal Reserve spokesperson did not answer a question by ICIJ and TBIJ about whether the regulator allowed banks to report the complexity indicators in the way described by the whistleblower. Instead, the spokesperson pointed to the overall higher amounts of additional capital that large U.S. banks must hold in comparison to European counterparts, and the advisory nature of the international banking standards.\n\n\u201cComparing how U.S. and European banks calculate their capital surcharge exposures is not a proper comparison,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe largest and most complex U.S. banks are required under Fed rules to have substantially higher capital surcharges than their international counterparts and substantially higher capital surcharges than specified under the non-binding Basel Accord.\u201d\n\n\u2018Our smartest people\u2019\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, banking regulators across the globe agreed to a set of rules designed to strengthen oversight and regulation of banks. These new rules attempted to ensure that banks kept enough capital on hand to survive another crisis on their own without relying on a large taxpayer bailout, as occurred in the United States in 2008.\n\nThe executives of the largest U.S. banks, meanwhile, have made no secret that they consider how the U.S. has implemented these rules a roadblock to greater profits.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said previously the bank was working hard to minimize the capital it was forced to hold \u2014 assets that could otherwise be loaned out, disbursed to shareholders as a dividend, or awarded to executives in the form of annual bonuses. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our smartest people figuring out every angle to reduce capital requirements for JPMorgan,\u201d Dimon said in 2023.\n\nA spokesperson for the Financial Services Forum, which represents the largest U.S. banks, said that the amount of capital these banks hold has tripled to nearly $1 trillion over the past 15 years, and that the organization has urged the Fed to review U.S. capital requirements \u201cwhich are higher than international standards and have increased due to economic growth and inflation unrelated to systemic risk.\u201d\n\nThe complexity indicators described by the whistleblower constitute a substantial part of a bank\u2019s total global systemic risk score. A reduction to the bank\u2019s score on those indicators could therefore have a tangible effect on its capital requirements.\n\nThe complexity indicators also require banks to report their overall trading volumes. Large banks often hold both long positions, which increase in value when the assets appreciate, and short positions that decline in value if the assets appreciate. If the banks net, or offset, their long and short positions, their trading volume will look smaller.\n\nA bank that holds long and short positions in a single security, for example, might have zero net exposure \u2014 but it would be more complex than a bank with no positions in that security. For that reason, Federal Reserve rules and international standards require banks to report the long position and specifically prohibit netting short and long positions.\n\nThe whistleblower included in their letter what they alleged was a description of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s methodology for reporting these indicators. It described a practice dubbed \u201cinternal operational elimination,\u201d which the firm asserted did not constitute netting. The whistleblower contended that this policy was functionally the same as netting and derided the interpretation as \u201cnonsensical.\u201d\n\nAnother former JPMorgan Chase banker, who has since moved to another large U.S. bank, said other banks subject to the capital surcharge have adopted similar policies to JPMorgan Chase in reporting these indicators.\n\nIt\u2019s deeply unfortunate that [the Federal Reserve] would allow the banks to get away with violating very clear domestic and international standards, but even more shocking to do it in a way that\u2019s so opaque \u2014 former U.S. Treasury official Graham Steele\n\nAsked if the banks had sought approval for that interpretation from the Federal Reserve, the banker said: \u201cU.S. firms are kind of discouraged from making the regulators their interpretive offices. Supervisors expect the banks to have expertise, to do their work and then it\u2019s subject to review. It\u2019s less asking for permission up front and more of doing the interpretations and being subject to being told that they\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\nSteele, the former Treasury official, said the Fed\u2019s failure to enforce its own rules was concerning, and could potentially advantage some U.S. banks over others if all banks were not made aware of its position at the same time. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply unfortunate that [the Federal Reserve] would allow the banks to get away with violating very clear domestic and international standards, but even more shocking to do it in a way that\u2019s so opaque,\u201d he said.\n\nGaming the rules\n\nFormer policymakers and economists critical of the Federal Reserve told ICIJ and TBIJ that the U.S. regulator\u2019s approach on this issue fits within a larger pattern of caving to banks\u2019 desire for less regulation, and could undermine international coordination on banking standards.\n\nThe banking industry waged a lobbying blitz in 2023 and 2024 against proposed rules, dubbed the \u201cBasel Endgame,\u201d that would increase capital requirements for the largest U.S. banks. Lobbyists for the banks paid to put up billboards opposing the new rules alongside major highways and Washington\u2019s Reagan National Airport, and even aired ads during Sunday Night Football warning that the rules would increase costs for working-class Americans.\n\nIn September, the banking industry scored a major victory when the Fed dramatically revised its plan, proposing a 9% increase for large U.S. banks instead of the 19% increase it had proposed in summer 2023. The Fed\u2019s vice chairman for banking supervision, Michael Barr, also announced in January that he would step down from his position after advisers to President Donald Trump mulled an effort to demote him. Barr had come under attack by Republicans in the Senate in part for his role in pushing for higher capital requirements.\n\nLeak to us\n\nContact ICIJ Do you have a story about corruption, fraud, or abuse of power? ICIJ accepts information about wrongdoing by corporate, government or public services around the world. We do our utmost to guarantee the confidentiality of our sources. LEAK TO ICIJ\n\nBy deviating from international standards, critics also said the Fed had made it more difficult to ensure a level playing field among banks across the globe.\n\n\u201cNo individual country will want to penalize its own large banks,\u201d said David Aikman, a professor of finance at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThey\u2019ll only sign up to those rules if they think everybody else is applying the rules faithfully.\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nIn response to external attacks on DEI at big-name financial firms, JPMorgan Chase CEO and Chair Jamie Dimon had a few choice words regarding the activists: \u201cBring them on.\u201d\n\nThe comments were made Wednesday on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d program, filmed at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThis comes shortly after President Donald Trump\u2019s two-day cascade of executive orders \u2014 including several that dismantle or seek to dismantle DEI initiatives \u2014 following his inauguration on Monday.\n\nThe forum correspondent asked Dimon about \u201ca rebuke of ESG, a rebuke of DEI\u201d spearheaded by conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck.\n\n\u201cYou now have a couple of activists going after your company,\u201d the interviewer said.\n\n\u201cReally? Not that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Dimon responded. When the interviewer pushed him, Dimon said, \u201cWell, bring them on.\u201d\n\nStanding by DEI, despite executive orders\n\nTrump has signed at least five executive orders that pertain to DEI in both the public and private sector:\n\nThe topic of executive orders came up during the conversation with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s CEO.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t like monikers and it makes it sound like it\u2019s a binary thing of what you do,\u201d Dimon said at one point. He outlined what JPMorgan Chase does and has \u201calways done.\u201d\n\nWhile some policies may change, he acknowledged, the firm has long followed its own map.\n\nFor example, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve always done our own thing in climate. So we get criticized by people on the left and the right about climate. We\u2019ve financed the biggest oil and gas companies \u2014 who\u2019ve done a great job reducing their CO2, by the way. We\u2019re the biggest financer of solar and wind.\u201d\n\nAdding to his illustrations of arguable contradictions, Dimon said, \u201cWe are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community [...] And wherever I go, red states, blue states, green states, mayors, governors [...] they like what we do.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to pander to any which side or any which thing.\u201d\n\nHR Dive reached out to JPMorgan Chase for additional comment. A spokesperson pointed to Dimon\u2019s previous statements on diversity and inclusion efforts. The document, published in 2023, highlights the firm\u2019s commitment to business resource groups and community outreach for Black people, women, veterans and people with disabilities.\n\n\u201cThis approach is integral to what we do, in great scale, around the world \u2014 and it works,\u201d Dimon said at the time. \u201cWe are quite clear that whether our efforts are inspired by the goodness of our hearts (as philanthropy or venture-type investing) or good business, we try to measure the actual outcomes.\u201d",

In 2020, JPMorgan announced a $30 billion program aimed at working on racial equity in personal finance, a move that came as other financial institutions made significant commitments to similar causes. JPMorgan's program included mortgage refinancing and working with historically Black colleges and universities.\n\nDimon's comments at Davos came after the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative nonprofit, proposed this month that JPMorgan revisit how executive compensation is tied to the company's racial-equity goal.\n\nJPMorgan started an \"accountability framework\" in 2020 to assess executives' progress toward DEI goals, which affects compensation. The firm doesn't publicly break out what proportion of executive pay, including for Dimon, is tied to DEI work.\n\nJPMorgan declined to comment on the shareholder proposal.\n\n\"I don't understand why these Wall Street banks are zigging when the rest of Corporate America is zagging on DEI,\" Paul Chesser, the director of corporate integrity at NLPC, said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\n\"Both CEOs, David Solomon and Jamie Dimon, should be smart enough to understand that you don't need DEI quotas to achieve fairness and equality in things like hiring and promotion,\" Chesser said.\n\nNLPC has sent shareholder proposals focused on climate, China, and other issues to major companies in recent years.\n\nIn a different interview with CNBC on Wednesday, David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, said that he'd seen news of shareholder proposals but that he hadn't yet looked at any of them.\n\n\"We're advising our clients to think about these things,\" Solomon said. \"They think about decarbonization, they think about climate transition. They think about their businesses, how they find talent, the diversity of the talent they find all over the world.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nShareholder proposals \u2014 about any subject \u2014 do not always end up on companies' ballots. Proposals against ESG, including those against DEI, that came to a vote have garnered little support in the past three years, a review by the consultancy ISS-Corporate found. The NLPC and another conservative advocacy group, the National Center for Public Policy and Research, submitted more than 80% of the anti-ESG proposals in the last three years, per ISS-Corporate's research.\n\n\"These politicized campaigns have failed to make the case for the economic impact related to the requests,\" the report's authors wrote in November.\n\nOn Thursday, Costco investors overwhelmingly rejected a proposal from the NCPPR to report on the possible risks of the company's DEI efforts.\n\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order ending DEI programs in the federal government and an order ending DEI-based hiring in the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nIn recent months, several high-profile companies have rolled back their DEI programs , including Meta, McDonald's, Ford, and Walmart \u2014 the nation's largest private employer.\n\nJanuary 23, 2024 \u2014 This story has been updated with comment from the NLPC, more information on anti-ESG proposals, and Costco's Thursday vote.",

            "content": "Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM 3.36%) are up a fantastic 55% over the past year, strongly outperforming the S&P 500 index's 26% gain. The banking giant has successfully leveraged a resilient economic backdrop into a record year for profitability.\n\nThis momentum was evident in its latest fourth-quarter earnings report (for the period ended Dec. 31), which exceeded Wall Street expectations. The bank posted Q4 earnings per share (EPS) of $4.81, up 58% from last year.\n\nWith the stock trading near a record high, investors may be wondering if the rally has further room to run or if the opportunity has already passed. Let's discuss whether JPMorgan Chase stock is a buy now.\n\nJPMorgan's record year by the numbers\n\nThe allure of JPMorgan Chase as an investment starts with its dominant position as the largest U.S. bank, bolstered by a globally diversified financial services footprint. Its size and scale have proven to be a significant advantage during a period in which smaller institutions have struggled to rebuild market confidence following the 2023 industry turmoil that saw several regional banks collapse. In this case, JPMorgan has consolidated its market share by attracting deposits from a growing client base.\n\nThese dynamics have powered an impressive set of operating and financial results. Even with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates last year, pressuring the bank's net interest income, Q4 revenue rose 11% year over year.\n\nThe investment banking division stood out particularly well, with fees surging 49% from last year, reflecting an improved environment for deal-making, as well as larger mergers and acquisitions. The strong performance in global asset prices contributed to a 21% increase revenue from the markets and securities services group and also helped drive client assets under management up 18% compared to the end of 2023. Meanwhile, the consumer business continues to show strength through solid debit and credit card sales.\n\nPerhaps the most significant development has been the stable credit conditions. Compared to fears of widespread delinquencies in the loan portfolio in recent years, the Q4 provision for credit losses at $2.6 billion was down 15% sequentially from Q3 and 5% lower from the prior-year quarter. This trend has kept costs subdued and drove full-year EPS to $19.75 per share, up from $16.23 in 2023. Overall, JPMorgan has reaffirmed its position as a blue chip stock with industry-leading fundamentals.\n\nWhat's next for JPMorgan in 2025?\n\nHow JPMorgan Chase performs in 2025 will largely depend on how economic conditions evolve. A backdrop of a firm labor market and durable credit conditions would support the bank's income growth. Investors comfortable with this baseline scenario have good reason to buy or hold the stock.\n\nOn the other hand, when considering any investment, it's important to examine it critically and think about what could go wrong. While projecting optimism in the outlook by citing the still-low unemployment rate and improving business optimism in the U.S. into the new year, comments by CEO Jamie Dimon also offered a word of caution. He specifically highlighted inflationary pressures and volatile geopolitical conditions as primary risks within the bank's range of possible scenarios.\n\nSimply put, if inflation accelerates while the economy slows, JPMorgan's results would likely suffer. Investors must weigh several uncertainties, including interest rate trajectories, fiscal policy under the new Trump administration, and the Federal Reserve's future moves that could impact the stock.\n\nBeyond these factors, JPMorgan's shares appear relatively expensive, trading at 2.2 times book value, well above the decade average of 1.5. Separately, the stock's dividend yield of about 1.9% has settled near its 10-year low. While this premium valuation doesn't necessarily signal the stock needs to be sold off, my interpretation is that it may limit the upside potential in the near term.\n\nDecision time: I'm on the sidelines\n\nThere's a lot to like about JPMorgan Chase, which is well-positioned to reward shareholders over the long run. That said, I believe the stock is just a bit too pricey following the spectacular rally over the past year to jump in and buy with bullish conviction. Ultimately, investors may find more compelling stocks with better value elsewhere.",

JPMorgan Chase & Co. et al. was filed on Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nDaniel Wright, a participant in the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan, claims JPMorgan failed to engage in a reasoned and impartial decisionmaking process before deciding to use the forfeited funds in the plan to reduce the company\u2019s own contribution expenses.\n\n\u201c[JPMorgan\u2019s] wrongful conduct \u2026 caused the plan to receive fewer employer contributions than it would otherwise receive, and depleted plan assets,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nThe complaint also alleges that JPMorganChase saved itself millions of dollars in contributions by allocating forfeitures in this way.\n\nMore than 30 other forfeiture lawsuits have been filed against employers since 2023, all with similar allegations of using forfeited funds to help reduce future employer contributions.\n\nThe IRS reaffirmed its position in 2023 that 401(k) plan forfeitures can be used to pay plan expenses, reduce future employer contributions or to make an additional allocation to participants. Some attorneys have also argued that if the practice is allowed in a plan\u2019s documents, it should not be a violation of ERISA. The Department of Labor has yet to comment on this litigation trend.\n\nSeveral large employers have been targeted by such lawsuits, most recently Amazon.com Inc. earlier this month. BMO Financial Corp. also recently filed a motion to dismiss a complaint against the firm\u2019s use of forfeitures. Haffner Law PC, which represents Wright, is also representing plaintiffs in the BMO case, as well as a similar suit against Bank of America.\n\nSome forfeiture lawsuits have been dismissed by district judges in recent months, including those against BAE Systems Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Clorox Co.\n\nIn the JPMorganChase case, the plaintiff, Wright, is asking that all assets and profits secured by JPMorganChase as a result of each violation of ERISA be disgorged and is seeking removal of the fiduciaries who \u201cbreached their duties.\u201d\n\nThe JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan had more than $44 billion in assets and 292,458 participants, according to its 2023 Form 5500 filing. Employees are fully vested in the plan after three years, according to the complaint.\n\nJPMorganChase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

The market for private lending was estimated at $2 trillion last fall. It offers a capital lifeline for a range of \u201cespecially smaller firms that may have been, or still are, underserved as they seek capital from traditional channels,\u201d PYMNTS reported in October.\n\nPinto said in the interview that although the private credit industry slowed when the pandemic began, robust government guarantees during those years meant that it hasn\u2019t truly been tested.\n\nThe growth of the private credit sector has also caused concern among regulators about potential threats to the financial system, per the Bloomberg report. Banks, meanwhile, are wondering how to deal with this industry.\n\n\u201cBanks, we\u2019ve been lending for 200 years,\u201d Pinto said in the interview. \u201cWe are in an amazing position to compete because we have relationships with all those clients, and we offer to them not just the loan, we offer to them a bunch of activities.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PYMNTS wrote last week that the small- to medium-sized business (SMB) market shows \u201cvast\u201d potential. More than 33 million SMBs operate in the United States, according to U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates. They employ nearly half of the overall workforce.\n\nPYMNTS Intelligence found that most SMBs must grapple with delayed payments and about 60% struggle with cash flow. Loans and other credit products, such as virtual cards and expense management solutions, can prove useful when helping SMBs survive.\n\nIt was reported last week that Pinto is retiring after 40 years at J.P.

He will will relinquish his role June 30 to Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of commercial and investment banking, and then retire next year.\n\nFor all PYMNTS B2B coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B Newsletter.",

(\u201cI\u2019m talking about the U.S. stock market,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s not true for stock markets around the world.\u201d)\n\nU.S. stocks were some of the world\u2019s top performers last year after soaring the prior year as well. The outperformance has been driven by years of a strong U.S. economy, underpinned by a resilient labor market and consumer spending, in the face of elevated interest rates.\n\nWall Street generally expects the U.S. to continue to outperform this year, thanks in part to the animal spirits expected to be unleashed by President Donald Trump\u2019s deregulation and tax-cutting plans. Dimon, asked Wednesday why he\u2019s \u201ccautiously pessimistic\u201d rather than \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the economic outlook, pointed to elevated asset values.\n\n\u201cYou need really good outcomes to justify those prices,\u201d he said. \"Having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there and they can tend to surprise you.\u201d\n\nBy one measure, Trump is inheriting the priciest U.S. stock market in history. According to a Wall Street Journal analysis, the stock market\u2019s Shiller P/E ratio on the day of Trump\u2019s second inauguration was 44% higher than at the start of Herbert Hoover\u2019s inauguration just months before the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression.\n\nDimon's concerns extended beyond stock valuations. Echoing statements made last week in JPMorgan's quarterly earnings report, he said he was worried about the long-term risks of bubbling geopolitical tension in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Global sovereign finances, he said, were another cause for concern.\n\n\"What I\u2019m a little cautious about is the deficit spending,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a global issue, not just an American issue.

            "content": "Navigating the hedge fund frontier: Insights from CPP Investments\n\n[Music]\n\nKumar Panja: Welcome to another episode of Market Matters. My name is Kumar Panja and I run the EMEA Capital Advisory Group here at J.P. Morgan. I'm joined today by Amy Flikerski, a Managing Director and head of the External Portfolio Management Group at CPPIB. Welcome, Amy.\n\nAmy Flikerski: Thanks, Kumar. Great to be with you.\n\nKumar Panja: Great to see you again. So what we thought we would talk about today, kind of three things, and we're going to interweave, lace them through the conversation today. The first thing we'll talk about are questions that hedge fund managers have, whether it's aspiring hedge fund managers, whether it's established hedge fund managers. And the questions they have and they ask us about how to approach CPP Investments, things like team structure, things they should be doing, how they should engage. The second thing is certainly from our perspective, CPP Investments is held up as a model for some other investors for long-term investing in particular. And I think it'd be useful if you could share some insights into kind of how you've done that and what is the model going forward. And then we'll also, of course, touch on current themes of the day. And as I said, we'll mix it up what we talk about. But for those hedge fund manager listeners who are not aware of CPPIB's impact in the hedge fund space. Not quite sure what stone you've been under, but I direct you to their website, which has a lot of good information and unusually so because, one of the things we'll talk about is the transparency that you provide. But if any of you want to know more about CPP Investments-- before you speak to them, please do call me or anyone on the team, and we're happy to talk through before you engage with CPP. I think, Amy, you would be useful to talk about your specific role within external portfolio management.\n\nAmy Flikerski: Happy to do that. Thanks, Kumar. So I lead the External Portfolio Management group. We're a global team. We manage a fair bit of capital focused on just public market external managers. We are based in Toronto as a firm, but we are global as a group and we have a global footprint as a result as well. So we're Toronto, London, Hong Kong, New York. We're about 40 people. And my role is to lead this team. And what we do is investments in established managers, emerging managers, as well as public market co-investment opportunities through managers. So it's a broad-based program. And then we also have portfolio construction and risk within the team as well.\n\nKumar Panja: Right. And you talked about, you know, the stripes in the team just a moment ago. Certainly one of the questions that we get is about the team structure. Is there, you know, an entry point or several points that you would suggest the managers when they come into CPP? How is the team structured?\n\nAmy Flikerski: In terms of how we're set up, we have sub-strategy specialists, so we have senior team members who are the point people for those strategies. And as I mentioned it's really broad in terms of the coverage, from the commodity insurance linked to more scalable areas like fundamental equities. But basically, the approach would be through either J.P. Morgan Cap Intro or through our team directly. We're one team so it's quite flat if any inbounds come either to me or to other colleagues we figure out how to direct them appropriately. But in terms of kind of fleshing out the structure, we've got roughly those six to eight strategy leads, myself. And then we have a number of mid and junior colleagues who are supporting us and that makes up the 40 people across the different geographies.\n\nKumar Panja: Very good. Just looking back now for kind of the last three or four years, and the current investing environment seems quite positive. I mean, you and I were talking about one of the charts that my colleague here, long-term strategist, Jan Loeys uses to show hedge fund excess returns over the last 25 years. And the listeners can't see the chart, of course, we don't have that facility here. But Amy and I have looked at the chart and what it shows is those excess returns were there kind of up to about sort of 2006. And then went into kind of flat to negative territory and has come back up not to the same levels as certainly in the late 90s/early 2000s, but it's certainly come back up. So all of that sort of paints the picture that I think most of our listeners are aware of by now, that it's a good environment to be investing in hedge funds. It's a good time to be a skilled hedge fund manager deploying their skills into the marketplace. How have the last three years looked for CPP? I mean, what's performance been like?\n\nAmy Flikerski: The last three years have been really strong, particularly 2022, I think when broader markets -- bond and equities -- were down, and there was a correction in tech. I think we were able to demonstrate through our hedge fund program which is very diversified and global that we could generate returns even in amidst the market backdrop. And really show the benefit of de-correlated nature, or uncorrelated nature of hedge funds in that kind of period. So, I think that is a really good testimony to the value of hedge funds and having the diversification and having that exposure in portfolios.\n\nKumar Panja: And does that mean that the view on the current environment is positive so that you are continuing to deploy money?\n\nAmy Flikerski: Absolutely. The chart that you reference is compelling, and I think we do see that in terms of pull forward of returns through hedge funds, it's been a strong 2024. And I think that investors broadly have seen the benefit, of course, of having the public markets exposure: the ability to have more flexibility in capital deployment through public market hedge fund managers, the ability to access parts of the market like macro or credit or systematic which are complementary to whatever private equity or venture.\n\nKumar Panja: Mm-hmm.\n\nAmy Flikerski: Or even private credit that they may have in their portfolio. So I think it's a great opportunity set as we continue to see evolution in the market. We just had the U.S. election, of course, and we'll continue to see what happens, but it's a great backdrop in terms of potentially, you know more deal making, more confidence, more activity, which could translate to better opportunity set across different strategies.\n\nKumar Panja: Yeah, I mean on that point, I think this kind of the mid to longer-term environment, which we just touched on, I think. It's been observed that the -- a combination of the-the kind of macroeconomic backdrop of elevated fiscal spending, political uncertainty around the world at higher rates. And just greater macro volume in particular provides the environment for hedge funds to do what they're supposed to do and therefore improve hedge fund returns. Do you think that applies to all sectors in the hedge fund space, or do you think there are some that are naturally poised to perform better in that type of backdrop?\n\nAmy Flikerski: I think it's tough to call the alpha in a given strategy. So we tend to think of it as hard to time strategies. So we have roughly a band of allocation across our different areas, and the diversification in the way they all fit together is really kind of the-\n\nKumar Panja: A secret sauce.\n\nAmy Flikerski: -special sauce, exactly, if you will. [laughter] If one wants to call it that, I think that's where it all comes into play. The complementary nature of macro, of fundamental and systematic kind of coming together. So it's always going to ebb and flow in terms of what you've described, but we think the breadth of our program enables us to deliver on that alpha opportunity set.\n\nKumar Panja: And you are known to be an investor with a large portfolio, and therefore making kind of large investments. But what about niche strategies, are they still of interest?\n\nAmy Flikerski: So we have a large program, as you mentioned at the start of a very large investor in hedge funds globally. With the seeding, I think we're quite known for that. But we do a lot of different types of investments, both large and early stage. And sometimes they are niche opportunities that are not emerging managers. They can be in nascent markets like carbon trading or specialty sector funds. So we do target that in terms of the potential for higher return profile. Scale and capacity is important to us, but we also think there's a role to play of more niche strategies within our portfolio. For example, fixed income relative value has been an important bedrock of the program as well. And we may have an approach where we'll invest in more managers where its capacity constrained to kind of get the aggregate asset allocation that we're looking for.\n\nKumar Panja: And one of the topics that we've had from investors, particularly North American pension groups, but not exclusively, has been an increasing interest-- reinterest in portable alpha, which you know, it's a concept that we know has been around for years, cost-effective way to effectively increase returns on public equity portfolio by building in alpha from long only on the long-only side to complement equity beta. What's your view on that?\n\nAmy Flikerski: Sure. I think that it sounds that the evolution of portable alpha has evolved since its initial beginnings in the 2000s. It sounds to me that it's a big area of interest from a lot of different pools of capital. For CPP Investments, we're trying to deliver alpha for our organization. And so we effectively act in a portable alpha type of nature where we're complementing our--\n\nKumar Panja: You are the alpha stripe.\n\nAmy Flikerski: --private equity -- exactly. We're the alpha piece. And there's another department that is doing that as well, which is called active equities. But that's effectively what we're trying to do. So it makes a lot of sense for those who are really trying to allocate fee dollars for something that's unique and special above what they can access more cheaply through passive exposure.\n\nKumar Panja: Yeah. Okay. If we pivot now to questions that managers often pose to us when they ask about CPP Investments and say, \"How do we go about getting in touch?\" And there's a bunch of questions that they ask us. One of the questions, and I think you mentioned it earlier, in terms of timing. They want to give it the best shot and equally, they don't want to waste your time. There's a tension there. What advice would you give to managers -- new managers -- that are thinking about approaching you?\n\nAmy Flikerski: Sure. So my colleague Yan Kvitko leads our emerging managers program, which is, as I mentioned, part of our team, we're one team. So Yan does like to meet folks early, even before they may have materials or a fund if they're just thinking about it. I think that's part of really what it is. It's a dialogue between us and the managers. And I'm sure Kumar, your team is doing the same thing. And we often also get, I think, introductions through your group in that sense.\n\nKumar Panja: That they shouldn't fret too much about the time.\n\nAmy Flikerski: Exactly. I think sometimes those early discussions can help shape how a manager wants to launch as well. Certainly, we're not trying to have a hands-on approach. We don't have that approach in terms of our investment. But it can help inform choice of providers or operational best practices, et cetera, or fee alignment for example as well. So I think there definitely should not be consternation around early conversations and it's, again, part of the process is to have evolving dialogue.\n\nKumar Panja: Yeah, no, that's good. The other thing that comes up a lot is the track record. And the managers sort of put themselves under a certain amount of pressure to make sure that they can show and they can come to that meeting, that first meeting or-or early meetings with a demonstrable track record. But of course, we both know that sometimes structurally there isn't the ability for an individual to have a track record that is attributed to that person, either because they've been working for a single CIO type hedge fund where the contribution of that particular portfolio manager can't be stripped out as easily. Or the other construct is where they've been working perhaps in a in a multi-manager set up where, again, there might be contractual restrictions about pulling out the data. But how do you think about that? What are your tips on managers preparing to show their contribution in that construct?\n\nAmy Flikerski: Yeah. That's a fantastic question. So we've been creative around that. Not all investors are the same. So for us, we don't need a minimum years of track. We have often actually invested even with no track, as you say, Kumar, no verified track. So what we do is we triangulate. So we say because of our participation in the markets, we'll often know the firm where they're coming from, so we can triangulate through both provided and off-list referencing to triangulate into the individual's contribution from a performance viewpoint. And again, not looking to the dollar, but to a general high-level sense. We also look at compensation to cross reference what the individual has shared in terms of their P&L impact. So we'll look at tax statements and things of that nature. So yeah, it's a triangulation process in which we'll look at many different pieces of information, but largely trying to pull together all the mosaic of data that we might be able to come across. But it all starts with a first conversation with the individual.\n\nKumar Panja: Of course it sounds very accommodating as you say. And the last point, because this isn't supposed to be a talk just about new managers, but a lot of managers will come to us and ask, you know, seed or not to seed and you know, and CPP Investments -- it is associated with being very active in the hedge fund seeding marketplace. But you know, is that something which managers need to get their heads around, or will you have relationships with new managers both with a seeding relationship and without?\n\nAmy Flikerski: So we kicked off formally our emerging managers program back in 2016. We had done some seeds before that, but we officialized the program with certain beliefs and approaches and what we do through early-stage managers is both seeding and capital acceleration. So seeding would be the day zero investment, the cornerstone anchor into a new launch. And we'll often actually negotiate for revenue sharing in that case to mitigate the downside risk that we're taking at that early stage. In addition to seeding, we also do what's called capital acceleration, where we're investing in a fund that may be two, three or four years old or more, but seeking those kind of more founders like fees. And in that case, there's no revenue share. And we're not incentivized so much around revenue share. It's more, again, the downside protection to going early. We are very focused on performance and return. So that really is what's driving our interest on the rev share side. And then more broadly why we do early stages to be able to access the capacity, future capacity as well, and to be able to kind of negotiate commercial terms that make sense for us. So I think it's something that we're known for and we are utilizing our long-term horizon as well as our stable capital to be able to participate in that way in the market.\n\nKumar Panja: In terms of established managers then, so again, we talked about this earlier. Your website is wonderfully transparent in terms of some of the relationships that you have with external portfolio managers. But the question sometimes comes to us from managers who've been, you know, running a business for several years, if not, you know, a decade or so. That is there an opportunity for them to engage with you if, for example, there might be another manager that does something that's similar or maybe it's in the similar segment. What are the rules of the road for established managers? Do they differ vastly from what you've just talked about in terms of new managers?\n\nAmy Flikerski: So we run one portfolio, so that's the beauty of having kind of a simple approach. We think about the portfolio in aggregate, we don't kind of think about it as the emerging manager portfolio and then the established, it's all one. And then one important point actually to add, if I may, to the emerging piece is we're evergreen investors. We don't have, you know, a pool of three-year capital that we need to then recycle. So if that emerging manager does well they, you know, quote unquote \"graduate\" into our core program, and again, it's the same pool of capital. But there's a view that we don't have to ever redeem because it's going well, it's meeting our objectives and they're no longer tagged as emerging.\n\nKumar Panja: And you recently launched another program, didn't you, to sort of capture even sort of smaller managers?\n\nAmy Flikerski: That's right. Exactly. So, Kumar, you're referencing what we call Inicio, so that's our answer to the SMA platform and the motivation for that. It's still in kind of early stages, but the motivation has been to be able to perhaps write smaller tickets-\n\nKumar Panja: Mm-hmm.\n\nAmy Flikerski: -to access an even wider breadth of managers back to the niche point to enable additional diversification to what we have. And again, to see what success can come through the even earlier part of the funnel, if you will. Maybe just addressing the established managers. So we think about our program as what net new will be additive, what is complimentary. It doesn't mean because we have certain allocations that they're fixed and no further ones can come through that area. I think I referenced fixed income relative value as an example. We have that in the systematic space as well. So depending on capacity, we may go with more managers or fewer, it just depends. But basically, anything net new into the portfolio we'll analyze from a portfolio construction impact. And we often think about both the qualitative and quantitative such as correlations or volatility profile around that net new addition. So it's a constantly evolving program in which the direction of travel is increasing, in terms of dollars allocated. So we're very active, we're continuing to build our program and to continue to allocate.\n\nKumar Panja: And then again a nod to the sheer size of the portfolio in terms of, you know, what size you like to be. How do you think about sizing, particularly in say in established manager space?\n\nAmy Flikerski: We think about it as about roughly $300 million and above. We will have the initial immediate ticket that we'll invest, and then we'll also seek to negotiate the future capacity. Often that's easier of course with the emerging manager, but it can be sometimes with established. So we think about it as those larger tickets for established and potentially the anchor investor for a new launch. And then we'll also for the smaller Inicio type manager it could be $50 million and within a range of $50 to $75 or $100. We also do co-invest, so that's roughly the range between Inicio and co-investment more the agile, nimble dollar size-\n\nKumar Panja: Right.\n\nAmy Flikerski: -in contrast to the, you know, larger investments that we'll make for established groups.\n\nKumar Panja: I was going to ask you about the co-investment program because I think in recent years that's also got quite a lot of attention. And sometimes can be the way that you build up a relationship with a new established manager. Is that, again, is an area of focus?\n\nAmy Flikerski: Yes, definitely. It sits within our group as well so we see all of these as working in concert and all centered around the manager. So we have been growing our co-investment efforts over the years steadily from 2018 until now. So we-we have, you know-\n\nKumar Panja: So across all segments?\n\nAmy Flikerski: Yes.\n\nKumar Panja: Or strategy segments?\n\nAmy Flikerski: Yeah, it's effectively structured as fundamental trades and then macro or relative value type of trades. A lot of those ideas are coming through our existing managers, but we do occasionally work with what we call off-platform managers. So that can be, as you were saying, a way to get to know the group. We think the alignment with our existing partners is stronger but we do have scope of course to access investment ideas where we have, you know, economics, a compensation model that can also make sense with non-invested partners.\n\nKumar Panja: Okay. The other thing that I think to be quite interesting for our listeners is when things go wrong. And some of this-- again, you've been investing or CPP Investments have been investing in hedge funds for a long while, and through your career you'll have seen funds come and go through the portfolio. To your mind, how do things go wrong? And by go wrong I mean when a manager exits a portfolio. And how do things go wrong, is it always performance-driven?\n\nAmy Flikerski: Yeah, interesting question. So mostly it's not so dramatic, it is performance-driven. As we know, performance is the lifeblood of a fund that will attract more assets. And to the degree that performance is not there, assets also start to leave-\n\nKumar Panja: Mm-hmm.\n\nAmy Flikerski: -go out the door. And that often leads to sometimes a fund closure. So that's the most often where it goes wrong. It's that critical moment in time where a fund in year one, two -- has to deliver performance as well as get the investor interest or to keep and grow the investors who are making up the fee allocation. Otherwise, of course, if the fees are going down, it's harder to keep critical talent or to maintain an infrastructure. So it's all connected as we know, but that's most often what we will see. It's takes a few years to recognize that, but once it happens, it's sometimes an inevitable--\n\nKumar Panja: Yeah.\n\nAmy Flikerski: --outcome. And that's just the nature of our industry, isn't it? It's a creative destruction in terms of new launches and that close.\n\nKumar Panja: It's a different approach to saying that all of the managers need to perform all of the time. You will have some flex to say there are certain strategies, that's why you have the diversity that certain strategies won't be performing to the same degree. And that's why you've got that diversity of different strategy in the portfolio. But when you measure that performance of a single manager against a peer group, that's what you are looking at presumably.\n\nAmy Flikerski: Exactly. I think it's an important point to flesh out, which is we are a long-term-oriented investor. We think of ourselves as partners. We are driving towards commercial outcomes. So it's not an indefinite approach in that sense. We are comparing fund managers to the peer group. We're trying to understand what's the driver. There are always reasons why the returns may be less attractive. So it's not to say that if returns are down, we're out, absolutely not. We tend to err on the more patient side, but again, it's not indefinite. So we do a quarterly portfolio review where we look at all of our line items and we discuss this pretty actively. But in terms of decision making tend to be a bit more longer ended.\n\nKumar Panja: And just picking up on the talent piece that you mentioned there, congratulations on your recent accolade as one of 100 Most Influential Women in Finance. Of course, we think that you are one of the most influential people in finance full stop. But no, very well done on that. But talent and diversity, I think these are things that have been discussed in the past. You've been a big supporter, particularly minorities in hedge funds. What's your assessment on progress though to date?\n\nAmy Flikerski: Yeah, thanks so much, Kumar, [chuckles] as well. Yeah, it's slow. I think we see this more broadly in not just the financial services, but other industries as well. So it's an ongoing challenge and something that we all need to contribute to. But I think it's great to have aspects like emerging managers. And again, for us, it's not necessarily a women and minorities program, but emerging managers more broadly. But I think we do tend to see some of the diversity coming up through that channel as well. So I think it's a really important area of focus. We do think about that a lot as an organization in terms of our own internal efforts through employee groups, support groups, as well as our external efforts around things like board diversity or governance, voting. So we tend to try to impact that in broad ways. And then through our hedge fund program, I think it's really through the emerging manager channel.\n\nKumar Panja: And just sort of then looking forward then, what are some of the things that you think are going to be front of mind for either yourselves or for hedge fund managers that you are looking to invest in?\n\nAmy Flikerski: I think having been in the industry for a long time, this is a constantly evolving space. So it's the new innovations, whether that's the managed accounts, different ways of trading, alpha capture, the combination of quant and fundamental, for example. New innovations. Or even as you were talking about, macro or policy changes that can result in new opportunities. So I think it's just continuous evolution and being alive to that as well.\n\nKumar Panja: And as a program, would you say you are -- is it revolution or evolution?\n\nAmy Flikerski: Definitely evolution. We started as a program at CPP Investments, the external portfolio management team, started in 2004. I joined in 2012 and it's definitely been in a constant evolution in terms of refining, taking a very solid foundation, but trying to make it better and better year over year and moving with the opportunity side.\n\nKumar Panja: Well, given the amount of interest that certainly we hear about and feel from our client base and prospective client base, I think we're certainly in alignment with that. I think this has been very, very helpful. Thank you for being so candid. We've covered a broad range of topics, but uh, no, that was very helpful indeed.\n\nAmy Flikerski: Thank you so much and thanks for the partnership with J.P. Morgan. We're really grateful for that and look forward to working more together.\n\nKumar Panja: Thank you, Amy.\n\nVoiceover: Thanks for listening to Market Matters.

(Photo by Halil Sagirkaya/Anadolu via Getty Images) \u00b7 Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nThe lighter regulatory touch is a welcome sign for big banks such as JPMorgan, which have been lobbying for changes to rules that affect their industry.\n\n\"We're very hopeful that we do get a lighter touch regulatory environment in banking,\" Erdoes said. \u201cIt's particularly stifling, particularly when it comes to lending and keeping the global economies going.\"\n\nShe lauded Trump's new requirement that government workers be back in the office five days a week.\n\n\"A lot of this is exactly what you would do to have a very pro business environment,\" she said.\n\nAnother big bank studying the policies of Trump 2.0 closely is Bank of America (BAC), second biggest in the US behind JPMorgan.\n\nA subject of intense interest is the impact of any tariffs. Trump made it clear Monday that historic new duties are coming.\n\n\"We are thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada,\" the president said while signing a slew of executive orders in the Oval Office, and added that they could happen soon.\n\nCEO Brian Moynihan told Yahoo Finance that the Bank of America research team found that 10% to 15% tariffs wouldn't have a \"big impact on [the] economy or inflation,\" though when \"you start rising above that, it gets a little more interesting.\"",

            "content": "American banks are reportedly in \u201cgo mode\u201d with Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House.\n\nSo says Mary Erdoes, head of asset and wealth management for J.P. Morgan, who said Tuesday (Jan. 21) that the banking giant was hopeful the new administration would roll back some of its predecessor\u2019s regulatory restrictions.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the last administration and the number of new, significant regulations, it was eight times the number of significant new regulations versus the prior Trump administration,\u201d said Erdoes, whose comments at the World Economic Forum in Davos were reported by the Financial Times (FT).\n\n\u201cWith that comes multiple millions of man hours of paperwork. Work . . . that clogs up the system and stops the economy from continuing to have that very healthy flywheel. So we\u2019re really looking forward to that.\u201d\n\nThe FT notes that Erdoes remarks came at a time when Europe\u2019s banks are worried that a relaxed regulatory approach in the U.S. could place them at a competitive disadvantage if regulators on the continent call for tighter application of rules such as Basel 3.1.\n\nDuring the same panel discussion at Davos, Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters said it was important that rules were \u201cset consistently globally, so that we don\u2019t have this arbitrage from market to market.\u201d\n\nAlthough Europe might find it difficult to scale back certain regulations, the U.K. could shift heavily toward the U.S. system, one senior banking executive told the FT.\n\n\u201cThe UK government will be at the forefront of deregulation,\u201d the executive said. \u201cThey have delayed the implementation of Basel III to see how or if it is implemented in the US.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump issued a wave of executive orders on his first day in office this week, the administration\u2019s plans for banking regulation are not yet clear, though potential cabinet nominees have apparently floated some sweeping changes.\n\nAs covered here last month, some of these ideas include abolishing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and moving deposit insurance into the Treasury Department; eliminating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or confining its responsibilities to consumer education.\n\nThere\u2019s also the idea of either merging the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve or having just one of these agencies regulate banks.",

            "content": "Banks are kicking off the fourth-quarter 2024 earnings season with a bang, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM 3.36%), Bank of America (BAC 3.21%), Wells Fargo (WFC 3.02%), and Citigroup (C 2.45%) all hovering near 52-week highs.\n\nInvesting $3,500 into each stock will generate about $308 in passive income a year, likely even more if each company continues raising its payout.\n\nHere's what's driving bank stocks higher and the best dividend-paying bank stock to buy now.\n\nThe stars have aligned for big banks\n\nThe financial sector can be cyclical based on a variety of economic factors. Banks are affected by Federal Reserve policy, interest rates, commercial and residential real estate, corporate debt, consumer financial health, economic growth, and regulatory policy. In 2024, the macro backdrop was about as favorable as it gets.\n\nPerhaps the simplest reason the financial sector surged in 2024 and is continuing the momentum in 2025 is because a highly anticipated recession never came, setting the stage for deal-making and strong profits amid higher interest rates.\n\nWells Fargo blasted 6.7% higher on Jan. 15 thanks to solid results, including 11% higher diluted earnings per share and 15% growth in fee-based revenue. JPMorgan Chase popped 2% on Jan. 15 and reached an all-time high on Jan. 17 in response to excellent results and another year of record revenue and net income.\n\nThe good news is that earnings, not speculation, are driving big banks higher. However, it's a mistake to assume a business at the top of its game will stay that way forever. Myriad economic factors could lead to challenges for banks in 2025. JPMorgan Chase Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said on the fourth-quarter earnings call: \"We think it's important to acknowledge the tension between the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations. In that context, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios.\"\n\nWhen approaching the big banks, it's important to understand the composition of their revenue streams and exposure to capital markets and different industries. For example, JPMorgan Chase has a sizable banking and wealth management business, is involved in home lending, card services, and auto loans, has a huge commercial and investment banking division, and more. By comparison, Wells Fargo has spent the past four years simplifying its business through efficiency initiatives aimed at focusing on quality rather than quantity.\n\nYield compression\n\nNot long ago, you could count on 3% or higher yields from the big bank stocks. But stock prices have outpaced the rate at which the big banks have raised their dividends -- leading to lower yields.\n\nThe big banks don't exactly have the best ultra-long-term track records for consistent dividend raises. However, some banks have prioritized dividend growth since the financial crisis of 2008. JPMorgan has increased its payout every year since 2011, with its current annual dividend of $5 per share, more than triple the 2008 dividend.\n\nBank of America slashed its dividend during the financial crisis and began raising it again in 2014.\n\nSimilarly, Citigroup cut its quarterly dividend to just $0.01 per share in 2011 -- keeping it at that level till it gradually began raising the payout in 2015. Citi is a much smaller bank today than it was before the financial crisis. And even after last year's rally, the stock is still down slightly during the past five years.\n\nWells Fargo is the least reliable dividend payer of the group after it cut its quarterly dividend from $0.51 per share to just $0.10 per share in 2020, although it has since raised it to $0.40.\n\nDespite the industry's rocky past, dividends are now an integral part of the investment thesis of each company. Low yields aside, all four companies have relatively low payout ratios, which measures the cost of a dividend as a percentage of net income.\n\nA low payout ratio indicates that dividend expenses are affordable, and there's room to make sizable increases in lockstep with earnings growth.\n\nThe best big bank to buy now\n\nAnd while you could invest $3,500 in equal parts of each bank to generate more than $300 in annual passive income, some investors may want to focus on quality over dividend quantity by concentrating on JPMorgan, with the lowest payout ratio of the four.\n\nJPMorgan is the most expensive of the banks in terms of forward price-to-earnings ratio, but it is also highly diversified and arguably the highest-quality bank. As you can see in the following chart, JPMorgan is experiencing its fastest growth since before the financial crisis -- showcasing just how favorable this period has been for its business.\n\nAs valuations rise in the financial sector, it's paramount for value and income investors to focus on quality businesses that can perform well or even take market share during an industrywide slowdown. By maintaining diversification or concentrating on high-quality businesses like JPMorgan Chase, you can be well positioned no matter what the market brings in 2025.",

REUTERS\n\nHer comments came after the 78-year-old\u2019s second presidential inauguration on Monday; Trump moved to revoke nearly 80 executive actions by his predecessor Joe Biden hours after taking office.\n\nHe campaigned last year on threatening to slap huge tariffs on US trading partners such as Mexico and Canada raising the possibility of potential trade and market turbulence.\n\nBut Erdoes, a JPMorgan veteran who joined the firm in1996, said she saw signs that the new administration is set to be a boon for American businesses.\n\nShe told the Davos panel that the new commander-in-chief is keen to create a \u201cvery pro-business environment\u201d and that \u201canimal spirits are alive\u201d setting the US economy to \u201cgo mode\u201d at present.\n\nThe 57-year-old also praised Trump for his decision to order all US government workers back to the office in a sweeping crackdown on the permissive and cushy coronavirus perks of the Biden administration.\n\n\u201cThank God the U.S. government has done it, and hopefully that\u2019ll keep us ahead of other governments in the world so we can continue to compete.\u201d\n\n3 Erodes told the Davos audience that she expected a lighter touch approach to regulation from the new Trump administration. AP\n\nJPMorgan recently ordered its staff back into the office, sparking outrage from some employees.\n\nSeen as a possible successor to current CEO Dimon, Erdoes slammed the previous administration for strangling the financial industry with red tape.\n\nThe Harvard Business School alum expressed hope that Trump would pare back some of the rules.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the last administration and the number of new, significant regulations, it was eight times the number of significant new regulations versus the prior Trump administration,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWith that comes multiple millions of man-hours of paperwork. Work that clogs up the system and stops the economy from continuing to have that very healthy flywheel. So we\u2019re really looking forward to that,\u201d Erdoes added. \u201cHopefully that will keep us ahead of other governments in the world so we can continue to compete.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Dimon has repeatedly singled out the so-called Basel III rules, a global blueprint that demands banks to hold more emergency capital on their books so they can weather any financial storms.\n\n3 The Post revealed in November how senior Trump aides had used JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon as \u201ca sounding board\u201d for the new administration\u2019s economic policies. Getty Images\n\nCritics argue that diverts financing away from potentially profit-making loans, reducing access to credit for people and businesses who need it.\n\nThe majority of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees are yet to be confirmed with the new administration\u2019s plans to shake up the banking industry still unclear.\n\nThe Post revealed in November how senior aides from the then-Trump transition team had spoken to JPMorgan\u2019s Dimon to use the 68-year-old banking titan as \u201ca sounding board\u201d for the new administration\u2019s economic policies.\n\nA report by last month\u2019s Wall Street Journal suggested the president is mulling whether to abolish the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), a US government agency that guarantees deposits in US banks, and shift that responsility to the Treasury Department.\n\nIt also said that Trump could ax the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that angered many Wall Street executives during Biden\u2019s term in office.\n\nA group of major banks sued the CFPB last month over a rule, set to take effect in October 2025, that limits the amount they can charge in overdraft fees.",

            "content": "JPMorgan Chase, the US banking behemoth with a global footprint spanning over 100 countries, is on the front lines of the financial industry's fight to safeguard its systems and customer data. The valuable data held by financial organizations make them a lucrative target for financially motivated cybercriminals. Meanwhile, they are also a target for nation-state actors and hacktivists because of the cascading impact a cyber event could have on the global economy. Cast against the backdrop of escalating cyber threats, the financial industry has been compelled to accelerate its cyber resiliency. This has been further fueled by new regulations like the EU's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), demanding significant levels of cybersecurity preparedness. JPMorgan\u2019s Global CISO, Pat Opet, spoke to Infosecurity Magazine about these challenges and the bank\u2019s approach to tackling them, in coordination with the wider financial industry. This includes keeping up to date with the evolving threats facing finance firms, securing a widening supply chain and complying with complex regulatory requirements. Opet also highlighted what he views as the biggest challenges and successes in the cybersecurity industry today.\n\nInfosecurity Magazine: What have you found to be the most effective approaches to meeting compliance requirements amid rising cybersecurity regulation in the finance industry globally, including the DORA regulations? Pat Opet: In general, we view our compliance obligations as necessary provability for our security controls. We seek to evidence the fact that our controls are operational and deployed in all the places we expect them to be and automate that evidence to the greatest extent possible. DORA has two elements to it broadly that we look at. One is operational resilience \u2013 having response and recovery processes for tail risk disruptive events. We believe foundationally that security is made up of detection, prevention and the response and recovery components. Financial services in the US have put in an enormous of effort into response and recovery, particularly for tail risk scenarios. We\u2019ve changed our third-party obligations over the past several years to ensure that third parties are institutionalizing response and recovery to the extent that we expect them to. However, the reporting requirements for DORA are burdensome. The fact that we have to report incidents for every legal entity in any country that\u2019s subject to this regulation, and also individually report on the impact of an incident relative to that legal entity when we\u2019re a multi-provider business, is very taxing. In general, the more regulatory fragmentation there is, the harder it makes it for us to have consistency in the control outcomes that we expect.\n\n\"The reporting requirements for DORA are burdensome\"\n\nTherefore, we\u2019re big supporters of regulatory harmonization. We are also supporters of incident notification rules but the level to which it is taken in DORA is introducing a lot more overhead that we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ll see the value for. In the US, the reporting obligations are public, but in the EU, the obligations under DORA are private. I\u2019m not sure if the industry knows where that\u2019s headed. We are of course prepared to have the processes necessary to comply as we always would with any regulation. But the complexities of incident reporting here, in the 72-hour period with the level of depth expected, is burdensome. IM: How have cyber-threats targeting JPMorgan Chase and the wider financial industry evolved in the past year? PO: Disruptive impacts to third-party dependencies have been pervasive throughout the past year and that\u2019s been largely driven by ransomware attacks targeting perimeter facing vulnerabilities in our third parties or those that serve the broader ecosystem. These issues can cause business disruption in many of these companies. My personal view is that the ransomware actors have become far more sophisticated. They have leveraged automation to a great extent to perform mass compromise of vulnerable entities followed by selective targeting of victims. I think a lot of that is to do with the nationalization of vulnerability data in some foreign countries. For example, we\u2019re seeing China in the news with respect to cyber activity. Their national security laws require vulnerabilities to be disclosed by security researchers and companies in China to the government first. Those turn into zero days that are exploited by nation-state actors with follow-on exploitation by ransomware actors. It is also impossible to ignore the geopolitical conflicts, particularly between East and West, as contributing factors to the threat environment in general. Obviously we\u2019re paying very close attention to the alleged compromise of telecom networks by Volt Typhoon [in November 2024]. As a critical infrastructure entity ourselves, we depend on telecommunications. While what has been reported has been the targeting of particular data of sensitive individuals, there\u2019s nothing to say that this level of pervasive access couldn\u2019t be used to cause disruption. I think that geopolitical conflict has gone from serving intelligence purposes to potentially serving disruptive purposes. Everybody who\u2019s in a seat like mine needs to be paying close attention to that. The last trend is the combination of multi-factor authentication (MFA) phishing, token theft and search engine optimization poisoning, which has created an incredibly dangerous scenario that I don\u2019t think is well understood. For many years MFA was incredibly effective, mostly because it wasn\u2019t pervasive. Attackers just worked against organizations that didn\u2019t leverage MFA. Once it was prioritized from the White House on down, and security practitioners across the globe were promoting the use of MFA, many organizations adopted it. However, many of the methods of MFA that were adopted are phishable. Now we\u2019re in a situation where bad actors are page ranking malicious websites to cause individuals to sign in to what they believe are legitimate websites that are designed for MFA phishing. It\u2019s created a situation where MFA codes are being operationalized in real time by bad actors. IM: What are the challenges of monitoring cyber threats across JPMorgan\u2019s global IT estate and supply chain? What approaches are you taking to address this challenge? PO: In general, many suppliers don\u2019t operate with the same level of maturity in the control ecosystem that an organization in a highly regulated financial institution would. That itself leads to situations where these organizations are either compromised, and the concern is the disruption of services on one side, or the use of software that the suppliers distribute is exploited as a mechanism to establish access on the other side.\n\n\"Industry still lacks the necessary capabilities to evaluate the efficacy of open source or commercial software\"\n\nIt is challenging because the supply chain is broad. We\u2019ve done a couple of different things to try and mitigate this. We\u2019ve increased the depth of our analysis for controlled maturity within our most critical third parties. We have a robust third-party program which we run across the whole supplier base that JPMorgan interacts with. For our most critical third parties, we\u2019ve placed leaders from our penetration testing group with our third-party oversight organization to dig deeply into the areas we believe ultimately lead to compromise. This helps us better understand the likelihood of failure for the supplier and also help the supplier uplift their practices. In addition, several years ago we built an intelligence and security operations function that is focused on our supplier base, not on JPMorgan. The goal there is to passively collect as much information as possible about our supply chain and the entire ecosystem, and use those risk signals to proactively inform suppliers that they may have vulnerabilities prior to those issues becoming a problem. We\u2019ve seen a huge degree of efficacy in the speed at which our suppliers fix issues when compared to the market as a result of this specific focus on intelligence collection and then direct follow-up action. On the software supply chain side, industry still lacks the necessary capabilities to evaluate the efficacy of open source or commercial software. Practitioners in the community and companies that support all of us have made great strides in vulnerability identification for open and closed source packages and binary analyses. But the capabilities to perform malware analysis on a third-party package aren\u2019t pervasive. This means the SolarWinds type scenario is still one of meaningful concern to the community. We work through the Open-Source Security Foundation to try and increase practices on both sides and have experiment with a lot of tooling that we hope can enable us to do this internally. IM: How have you sought to build a strong cybersecurity culture across the wider business in your time as global CISO? What approaches have you found most effective and are there any that haven\u2019t worked as well as you had hoped? PO: We have experimented with a bunch of things. First and foremost, the burden is on us to have a talented security team and to meet the technology community shoulder to shoulder. Too often, security is high level and not in the detail. The first step in driving the right culture is ensuring we can meet the developers where they are and bring back some data and details to the table. Second is that we have to view ourselves as an enablement organization. We are there to support getting things done not preventing things from happening. If you combine those two things \u2013 the right level of depth and talent and the desire to further the business and get things done as an enablement organization \u2013 that drives a lot of the necessary changes to ensure the culture is in the right place. We educate at every level of the organization. There\u2019s a phrase \u2018let\u2019s never waste an incident\u2019, whether it\u2019s a public event or otherwise. We diagnose failures \u2013 technological and cybersecurity \u2013 and we educate everybody in the company on how those failures happened and why so that people understand it. However, we\u2019ve found that while we push requirements to the developer teams, they are often viewed as check-the-box requirements and they don\u2019t understand \u201cwhy\u201d it\u2019s required. For a time, we had a red team podcast series that helped teams understand the rationale behind some of the requirements. It helped bring to life the value of the requirement and potential impact. Another area we\u2019re exploring right now is the automation of threat modelling. Threat modelling allows you to elaborate the threats to a system and the controls that are necessary to defend it. However, it\u2019s hard to scale, because it depends on architects being embedded in all the places that you need to be to perform threat modelling.\n\n\"The burden is on us to have a talented security team and to meet the technology community shoulder to shoulder\"",

JPMorgan ultimately plans to shrink its footprint there by 244,000 square feet as leases expire, according to regulatory filings.\n\nIn October, the publicly traded company began marketing the 244,000-square-foot block of offices for lease.\n\nAfter its lease expires for the 244,000 square feet at 1 Front Street, JPMorgan will have 102,000 square feet of offices left in the building across two leases that end in 2029 and 2030.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s expansion at 560 Mission will give employees room to settle as the financial service firm calls them in to the office five days a week, from three days, beginning in March.\n\nParamount will also lose another prominent tenant at One Market Plaza, after Google announced last year it would exit its 300,000-square-foot office that it has occupied since 2018, once its lease expires in April.\n\n\u2014 Dana Bartholomew",

The oldest predecessor is The Bank Of The Manhattan Company which was founded in 1799 by Aaron Burr. At the time, The Bank Of The Manhattan Company was the 3rd oldest bank in the U.S. and the 31st oldest in the world. The Chase Manhattan Bank, a precursor to JPMorgan Chase, was later formed when The Bank Of Manhattan Company purchased Chase Bank which was established in 1877.\n\nJPMorgan & Co came to life in 1895 in order to finance the United States Steel Corporation. Itself a result of merger, the company also financed other early American businesses as well as aided the federal government by backing a bond offering. It wasn\u2019t until the year 2000 and after several more mergers that JPMorgan Chase & Co was born. It will be four more years before the merger with Bank One which is notable because it brings CEO Jamie Dimon into the picture.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co was instrumental in aiding the US government during the 2008 financial crisis. It backed the accounts of several major banks including Bear Stearns and eventually took over their operations. Today, JPMorgan Chase & Co operates as a financial services company worldwide with operations on every continent and in more than 60 countries.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co operates through four segments that are Consumer & Community Banking (CCB), Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB), Commercial Banking (CB), and Asset & Wealth Management (AWM). Services are available in branches in 48 of the 50 US states and around the world. Services are available via ATM, online, mobile, and telephone.\n\nThe CCB segment offers traditional banking services to consumers that include but are not limited to deposits, loans, mortgages, and lines of credit. The CIB segment provides investment banking products and services to businesses, institutions, and governments that range from prime brokerage, insurance, corporate strategy, and access to capital markets, to lending, cross-border financing, and derivative instruments. The CB segment provides financial services for small, medium, and large businesses including commercial real estate banking of all types.\n\nThe AWM segment provides investment management solutions to institutional and retail investors. This segment also provides retirement products, brokerage, trusts and estates, and investment management products.",

            "content": "Nobody doubts its resiliency. But resiliency doesn't always mean sustained explosive growth is in the cards.\n\nFew investors would argue that JPMorgan Chase (JPM 3.38%) isn't a solid company. After all, there's a reason it's the U.S.'s biggest bank, boasting nearly $3.6 trillion worth of assets. Credit the depth and breadth of its offerings, which range from consumer banking to wealth management to corporate fundraising, and more. It's got a lot of ways to generate profit-producing revenue. Look for continued dominance of its industry going forward too, driving the stock higher as a result.\n\nBut is JPMorgan the kind of pick that could set you up for life with near-guaranteed above-average gains? Keep reading.\n\nJPMorgan Chase, up close and personal\n\nYou probably know the company better than you think. It's been around in a form we'd recognize today since the late 1800s, mostly focused on institutional banking for the better part of its existence. It wasn't until 2000 -- when it merged with Chase Bank -- that it wholly embraced the consumer as well as the corporate aspects of the banking business. Today, the $700 billion company employs over 300,000 people who collectively serve over 90 million different customers.\n\nSheer size doesn't guarantee future growth, though. Indeed, the bigger the organization gets, the more difficult it can be to find new ways to tack on even more size. For any company to be the basis for a life-changing investment, it must be able to firmly outpace the mere rising tide of inflation and population growth.\n\nJPMorgan Chase just doesn't have that capability.\n\nSpeed bump ahead\n\nDon't misunderstand. As was noted, it is a solid company, and an equally solid investment ... particularly if you're looking for dividend income. Although the fallout from 2008-09's subprime mortgage meltdown forced the bank to axe the bulk of its dividend payments at the time, its annual payout began growing again by 2011 and hasn't stopped since. It's a reasonably safe bet that the company (along with most of its peers) won't allow itself to be blindsided like that again.\n\nStill, there are limits.\n\nAlthough the big bank's bottom line is growing of late, and its dividend growth even seems to be accelerating, this growth has taken shape at an extraordinary time for the business. That is, a period in which rising interest rates and a recovering economy not only whipped up demand for lending and corporate fundraising, but made lending a highly profitable business to be in as well.\n\nJust know that the underlying circumstances behind 2023's and 2024's banking booms are the exception, rather than the norm. More to the point, they're not sustainable. The U.S. Federal Reserve says it's likely done with its streak of rate hikes, in fact, with modest cuts expected for the coming couple of years. That should put the kibosh on lending's soaring profitability.\n\nIn the meantime, although Goldman Sachs -- and others -- believe this year should be a solid one for fee-bearing mergers and acquisitions, this too is a cyclical business that's actually been lackluster of late to the point of being disappointing. It wouldn't take much to produce a short burst of relative growth.\n\nIt's not clear what major deals might actually add real value for would-be suitors right now, just as it's not clear if there are any attractive IPO candidates that would meaningfully move the needle on JPMorgan Chase's investment banking business.\n\nNot a fast-growing business anyway\n\nThen there's the longer-term concern. That's the fact that the banking business just isn't a high-growth one.\n\nNumbers from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) paint the ho-hum picture, indicating that the U.S. banking industry's net income has only grown an average of about 5% per year over the course of the past 30 years. That's in line with the revenue growth New York University's Stern School of Business expects in the coming five years, too. The school expects per-share profits to pace higher by about twice as quickly, but this outlook reflects the benefit of stock buybacks more than actual profit growth.\n\nYou can find more compelling growth prospects in other industries. This one's crimped by market saturation and a limited amount of money being printed to eventually become monetizable assets. Indeed, JPMorgan Chase's own asset base has only grown about 3% per year since 2014, when it had $2.6 trillion on its books, and inflation arguably did the bulk of the heavy lifting between then and now.\n\nBe realistic with your expectations\n\nDon't panic if you already own JPMorgan Chase stock. It isn't doomed. Indeed, as was noted, it's a fantastic dividend payer and dividend grower. You can still step into a stake while the forward-looking yield stands at 2%. That's not bad, especially considering its healthy track record of dividend growth.\n\nIf you're looking for an investment that could prove life-changing, however, this one isn't it.\n\nIt's still a great way to round out your portfolio with a financial name. It's not a bad speculative pick to capitalize on recoveries from economic swoons, either, since these headwinds often seem to disproportionately punish bank stocks. This ticker outright soared beginning in 2014 once the last of the subprime mortgage debacle was shaken off.\n\nBut will it \"set you up for life\" better than a different name might? Doubtful. If you're looking for more explosive, sustained gains, consider something with bigger (long-lived) growth prospects.",

            "content": "Nothing like going to one of the largest research conferences in the world and having everyone down in the dumps about their sector. That was the case from the moment I got to JPMorgan's annual health healthcare conference in San Francisco on Monday to the moment I wrapped up my West Coast tour Wednesday. It felt more like a wake than an industry pep talk \u2014 something that happens when the room is full of people whose stocks are sitting near their 52-week lows, while so many of the host city's tech companies are banging on the roof of yearly highs. That's what happens when you are the pharma skunk surrounded by the tech garden party. I want to give you a behind-the-scenes look at a conference that's become more of a dealmaking marathon than an actual dog-and-pony show. It's such an important conference that I put Lisa Gill, who leads JPMorgan's healthcare research team, on \"Mad Money\" to describe what she expected to hear. A preview. I don't like to put analysts on the show. It's a CEO-driven show, not an analyst show, because I believe you should have no filter between the companies and you. Why should there be? You need to make up your mind, I don't want someone paid to do it for you. The conference is gigantic. There are thousands of people there: analysts, hedge fund managers, CEOs, public relations people, bankers, lawyers \u2014 everyone you need to put together a deal, and that's exactly what happens. Every year. Gill boasted about it on the show, talking about how a huge percentage of deals start at the conference. Why not? Everyone's there. You see people from companies you are interested in. You sidle up. You talk about commonalities. Take it from there. When I first heard this a decade ago, I didn't believe it. But I have now been making this pilgrimage for multiple years and I can tell you it's the truth. Not only do deals start here, they end here. I have seen takeover after takeover come to fruition. Here are some of the impressions and observations from this year's trip gathering. Think of them as takeaways to inform your investing decisions in the days and months ahead. 1. A dark cloud hangs over the industry. In previous years there was a joy to the conference. This year, the large number of police you saw from the moment you got there was a reminder that a prominent UnitedHealth Group executive, Brian Thompson, was murdered in early December at the insurer's annual investors conference. Sadness met you at the door. There would be no prominent managed care presenters this year. Safer for all. I had a full slate of executives to interview from the get-go. CEOs from Medtronic , Boston Scientific , Cardinal Health , Merck , Biohaven , Abbott Labs , as well as several off-the-record sessions with other leaders of companies \u2014 some private, some public. CNBC had an extraordinary makeshift setup in a hotel cafeteria, but before the assassination we had a full-blown studio, meant to be prominent. No need to be prominent now. 2. There are lots of excuses for poor performance ... I know most of these CEOs by now and we enjoy each other's company. We all joked about how poorly the group's been doing. The list of the excuses is as a long as half my arm but let me spew some: An economy that just won't quit. An economy that, if it slowed, would be greeted with interest rate cuts, which would drive money into the cyclicals. President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of Health and Human Services doesn't believe in the foundation of so much research: vaccines. A group of companies with nothing revelatory to offer. A leaving administration that was incredibly hostile to the group and was able to accomplish the unthinkable: passing legislation to allow Medicare to negotiate prices, via the Inflation Reduction Act\u2014 something that actually is deflationary. An incoming administration that seems equally hostile. A sense that Thompson's murder had a lot to do with a group that's not allowed to trumpet itself without calling needless attention to itself. 3. ... but plenty of positives, too. Once you got one-on-one with executives, there was a solid show-and-tell. Boston Scientific is crushing it and its competitors in atrial fibrillation (AFib). Medtronic is chronically undervalued, something that actually changed for the better as the week went on. Cardinal Health has value and isn't just a hated middleman (like Cencora and McKesson ). Merck's Keytruda cancer franchise is worth a lot more than you think. Bristol Meyer's schizophrenia drug Cobenfy is working and the scripts are stronger than you think. Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson's acquisition of Intra-Cellular for $14 billion for its central nervous system franchise meant to treat the same illnesses is not that effective (ouch!). Abbott Labs is going to win the big litigation involving its special infant formula which should add ten bucks to the stock. 4. That includes new innovative products. Once you get away from the stocks, you grow excited about what's happening. Lots of science, including potentially personalized medicine for hard-to-beat cancers. Lots of healthcare solutions, including Abbott Labs' consumer biowearable Lingo. The glucose monitoring system was a hit at CES earlier this month and gives you a readout of how your body's doing from a quarter-sized device. It's so much better than what you get from your Apple Watch that it should move the needle. 5. Even I got in on the dealmaking (sort of). We bought more shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb this week because of how amazing Cobenfy can be for what amounts to an epidemic of schizophrenia. The drug, which was approved late last year, can be so effective that I even told San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie that he ought to call Bristol CEO Chris Boerner and figure out a way to get the drug for many of the city's homeless, as they are rife with this horrendous illness. Hey, I did my own, perhaps sainted, dealmaking. 6. Weight loss drugs are the talk of the town ... The wonder drug that still has everyone talking is the GLP-1 franchise owned by Eli Lilly , its popular weight-loss treatment Zepbound and type-2 diabetes drug Mounjaro. (I didn't meet or see rival Novo Nordisk , which makes GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Wegovy). Lilly CEO David Ricks preannounced his quarter, which was weaker than expected, but gave an outlook which was stronger than expected. The dichotomy was stark as the stock got clobbered on the fourth-quarter shortfall but would, in a bull market, have been roaring 50 to 60 points. Yes it would have been that great. Another positive: The Biden administration on Friday unveiled the next 15 prescription drugs , including Ozempic, that will be subject to price negotiations between manufacturers and Medicare. That's a big deal considering there was talk that maybe Medicare wouldn't cover the weight loss drugs at all. 7. ... but are still a major source of debate. The real question revolved around the potential increase of U.S. adults using weight loss drugs to 12%, from the current estimate of 8%. Those users who want to stay vanity thin would have to pay out of pocket, but those with co-morbidities would be covered by any insurer. That's another reason why the trust keeps Eli Lilly, which now looks like a busted stock. The sheer number of trials for all sorts of things that haven't been talked about \u2014 joints, cancers, dementia, and alcoholism, among others \u2014 could drive that percentage even higher. Of course, there were plenty of people talking about how it could bankrupt \"the system,\" with others claiming it could have save millions. Everyone had an opinion even as I could sense that no one knew anything \u2014 especially because RFK Jr. is a believer in diet, exercise and the end of junk food as a way to lose weight, as if obesity is a choice and not an illness. 8. We are sticking with Eli Lilly. I came away with a definitive sense that Lilly stock is undervalued because of the trials going on for so many illnesses. But the stock cast a pall on the realities of the situation, again a bear market phenomenon. It would be so easy to kick this one out of the trust for a huge gain. But I am stubborn and want to buy back the substantial amount of shares that we sold. CEO Ricks is terrific. His confidence is palpable. He admits he screwed up the launch of the GLP-1s. Very few CEOs would ever cotton up. He knows that the sheer size of the demand and the convoluted way that they were distributed via the middlemen, chiefly Mckesson , was a problem. It didn't help that Hims & Hers and other outfits were allowed to make and profit from knock-off versions of the drugs when there was a shortage from Lilly (The FDA determined in December that there is no longer a shortage and those compounders have to wind down operations in the coming month or two). It's a total mess. I think everything will be figured out in 2025, so the estimates will prove low. Lilly is spending $20 billion to create manufacturing space. That's a huge competitive advantage. Don't forget the rest of the world. Lilly hasn't. The numbers could dwarf what people expect. 9. Cardinal and Abbott should be higher. I was struck by how Cardinal's generic drug-making business could be gigantic and is not priced into the stock, which trades more like a low-margin distributer than a manufacturer. Abbott is particularly aggrieved because the market is treating all litigation like it is equal and that means this fine company's stock is kept back by the dreaded Johnson & Johnson talc powder analogue, even as that will ultimately be resolved for less than what was expected by Wall Street. (The company's $8 billion proposed settlement would end tens of thousands of lawsuits alleging that its baby powder and other talc products caused cancer.) So many are worried about the loss of exclusivity for so many drugs, that the patent cliff is too great. I don't share that pessimism. 10. Opportunities abound. The execs are a cerebral group. They know that they are out of favor. They've been there many a time. They are prepared to handle it even as the biggest wild card, of course, is Trump himself. Is he pro-business for real? Is pharma a real business to him? Does he mean it when he says the middlemen take more than they should? It's certainly true from what I can tell and Rob Davis, the self-effacing Merck CEO, is willing to call them out on it. There's a lot of rancor there and it seems untenable if Congress was to examine the situation at the behest of the big drug companies. I know the rap on these execs. They are just salespeople. They don't develop anything. They have plenty of scientists. I see it up close because I am developing a drug with Biohaven that has yet to be announced. Scientists galore at that company. But they are the first to admit that they see so many opportunities at this conference \u2014 who can resist? In the end, isn't everything for sale?

(NYSE:JPM) stands against other best cheap stocks to buy for 2025.\n\nThe U.S. consumer prices report released this week revealed a less-than-expected increase in December, signaling a potential cooling in inflation pressures. This data has sparked bets on further tame inflation and a drop in interest rates. The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 0.2%, down from 0.3% over the previous four months. This marks the first decrease in the rate of core CPI growth in six months, driven by lower hotel prices, slower increases in medical care costs, and moderate rent growth.\n\nThe data has renewed hopes that the Federal Reserve might ease interest rates sooner than anticipated. Before the report, most market participants expected rate cuts to occur in the second half of the year, if at all. However, the latest data has bolstered expectations for two cuts this year and even the possibility of a rate cut as early as March. Following the release, Treasury yields dropped, the S&P 500 rose, and the dollar weakened.\n\nThe sharp surge in equity prices is not surprising, as lower interest rates are generally bullish for several reasons. When interest rates fall, borrowing becomes cheaper for companies, which can lead to increased investment and expansion. Stock prices are often valued based on the present value of future earnings or cash flows, discounted by interest rates. Lower interest rates reduce the discount rate, increase the present value of future earnings, and make stocks appear more valuable.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy and 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on January 16, Christopher Waller, Governor of the Federal Reserve, discussed the recent economic data and its implications for future monetary policy decisions. Waller welcomed the strong jobs report from the previous week and the latest inflation prints, which he found particularly encouraging. He noted that the inflation data was very positive, with core PCE inflation coming in below 0.2% for the sixth month out of the last eight. This trend, he believes, is bringing inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target in terms of core, despite a couple of bumps in September and October.\n\nWaller emphasized that while the inflation data is promising, it is crucial to see if this trend continues. He mentioned that base effects from last year will play a role, but he is hopeful that a repeat of the shock experienced in January and February of last year will not occur again. If the current trend persists, he suggested that rate cuts could be on the table in the first half of the year.\n\nWhen asked about the exact timing of potential rate cuts, Waller indicated that much depends on the continued improvement in inflation data. He stressed that the Fed is not in a rush to act, as Chair Jerome Powell has stated, and that they need to see more progress on inflation before making any decisions. Waller mentioned that while March is not entirely ruled out, any significant economic disruptions could push the timeline back. Regarding the number of rate cuts that might be expected this year, Waller reiterated that the data will drive the Fed\u2019s decisions. He noted that the extent of progress on inflation and the perception of the neutral rate among policymakers will influence the number of cuts.\n\nThe latest consumer price data has sparked optimism among investors, as easing inflation and the possibility of interest rate cuts create a more favorable environment for businesses and markets.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 15 best cheap stocks to buy for 2025, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 40 largest companies trading below the forward P/E ratio of 15 as of January 15.

It should be also noted that this movement began last year when workers at an Albuquerque branch voted to unionize while marking a historic moment for the bank.The unionization push at Wells Fargo has been actually driven by issues such as understaffing and low wages.In contrast to these ongoing things, the leadership of JPMorgan has dismissed employee concerns regarding the return-to-office policy while stating that it is the best way to run the company, asserted Fortune. However, at the same time, this approach might backfire as employees express severe dissatisfaction and consider organizing for better working conditions.The situation actually highlights a broader trend in the financial sector where workers are increasingly seeking representation to address their grievances, noted Fortune.Amidst growing discontent over the strict return-to-office mandate of JPMorgan Chase, several employees are reportedly engaging in numerous discussions about forming a labor union while being inspired by successful efforts at Wells Fargo.The unionization push at Wells Fargo has been actually driven by issues such as understaffing and low wages.",

(NYSE:JPM) stands against other best Fortune 500 dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nCompiled and published by Fortune Magazine, the Fortune 500 is an annual list that ranks the biggest US companies by revenue. In total, the Fortune 500 companies represent two-thirds of the US GDP with $18.8 trillion in revenues, $1.7 trillion in profits, and $43 trillion in market value (as of March 28, 2024), and they employ a workforce of 31 million around the globe.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks to Buy\n\n2024 proved to be a big year for large-cap stocks, as the broader US market achieved gains of nearly 25%, piggybacking on a 26% performance the year before. Large-cap stock funds, with the heaviest tilt toward growth stocks, performed the best last year, even as the market\u2019s rally somewhat broadened from the handful of mega tech companies that have led much of the bull market.\n\nHowever, the tailwinds that propelled the market to new heights are beginning to recede, as the rate of monetary policy easing slows down, long-term interests swing upward, inflation becomes sticky, and the US economy is slowing down. Moreover, the upcoming presidency of Donald Trump and his much-rumored tariffs could also herald a more volatile period for markets, as they could further fan inflation fears and put pressure on stock prices.\n\nThat said, the expected upcoming fluctuation isn\u2019t going to be something that the mega corporations haven\u2019t dealt with before. A 2023 report by J. P. Morgan revealed that despite the considerable volatility during the period, large-cap stocks gained around 162% between 2013 and 2023, galvanized primarily by big tech. Another 2023 report by CNBC unveiled that large US companies outperformed other investments between 2003 and 2023, with average returns of 9.3%. However, it hasn\u2019t always been a smooth ride, as despite the stability and reliability large-cap stocks are known for, investors had to survive drops of 56.8% during the 2007-2009 bear market, 33.9% in 2020, and 25.4% in 2022.\n\nIn addition to the few tech giants regularly making headlines with their gains, large-cap dividend stocks could also be an attractive option for investors looking for a reliable, significant, and growing stream of income. According to Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, the broader US large caps are expected to post an 8% increase in dividend payments in 2025, compared to the 6.4% uptick in 2024, 5.1% gains in 2023, and the 10.8% increase witnessed in 2022.",

Whether you made New Year\u2019s resolutions, pasted images on a vision board or crunched numbers on a balance sheet, you likely started the year with high hopes and big plans.\n\nNow is the perfect time to solidify your plans and take steps to help you achieve those goals. Starting strong can set the tone for the entire year.\n\nHere are six dos and dont\u2019s about financial planning and management that can help you achieve a fresh start and get closer to reaching your goals.\n\n1. DO create a budget\n\nOne common financial mistake is not having a budget at all. Remaining in the dark about your spending can limit your ability to save for important goals like a car, a home or your retirement. If you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re spending, there\u2019s a good chance you may be spending too much.\n\n2. DON\u2019T leave your budget up to chance\n\nUsing guesswork when trying to allocate your monthly budget can lead to overestimating or underestimating how much to allot toward each budgeting category. This may set you up for failure. Taking a month to assess and identify your spending patterns may help to establish a baseline as you\u2019re setting your budget.\n\n3. DO track your spending\n\nGet to know your spending by creating a monthly budget tracker. You can then review your spending and track it in a monthly budget worksheet. Over time, you can adjust which budgeting categories to cut back spending on. Expenses can fluctuate month to month, so be prepared to shift gears whenever necessary.\n\n4. DON\u2019T put wants and needs in the same category\n\nA common error beginner budgeters can make is mistaking \u201cwants\u201d for \u201cneeds.\u201d Needs are essential items like utility bills, rent or mortgage payments, and groceries. These are things you need to live. Wants, on the other hand, are non-essential expenses like dining out or entertainment. It may still be possible to find room in your budget to accommodate a few luxuries, but being honest with yourself about what\u2019s truly necessary may help you avoid this budgeting mishap.\n\n5. DO keep it simple\n\nThe idea of listing every single expenditure for a month might seem daunting, but you don\u2019t have to go that far. It can be helpful to create a budget that works for you, which includes making it manageable enough to take on in the first place. If you\u2019re just starting out, create just a handful of budgeting categories to help keep things simple.\n\n6. DON\u2019T skip the emergency fund\n\nLife is unpredictable and having an emergency fund to pay for unplanned expenses may help you during that time. Without it, you may have to dip into long-term savings or use a credit card if the unexpected arises. Creating an emergency fund doesn\u2019t have to be intimidating. When you\u2019re making your budget, include a monthly line item for emergency fund contributions. This can help build up your reserves over time. Many bank accounts even let you automate these emergency fund deposits.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nStarting the new year with a clear plan can set you up for success, and budgeting is a powerful tool to help you achieve your financial goals.\n\nStart tracking your spending now to set up your budget for the year and be aware of common budgeting mistakes. It\u2019s never too early \u2013 or too late \u2013 to get back on the road to financial freedom.\n\nFor informational/educational purposes only: Views and strategies described in this article or provided via links may not be appropriate for everyone and are not intended as specific advice/recommendation for any business.

(NYSE:JPM) stands against other best bank stocks to buy in 2025.\n\n2024 was a stellar year for banking giants in the United States. According to a report in the Financial Times, the seven largest banks in the country by deposits accounted for 56% of the industry\u2019s profits during the first nine months of the year, up from 48% during the same period in 2023.\n\nAmong these, the four biggest banks collectively reported around $88 billion in profits between January and September 2024, representing 44% of the American banking industry\u2019s profits. This puts them on course to grab their largest industry share since 2015.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Bank Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has stated that equity capital increased by 3.5% in Q3 2024 to $81.6 billion, reflecting the growing capitalization in American banks. In November, the Federal Reserve Board found that 99% of the country\u2019s banks reported capital above the regulatory requirements. This significant improvement from 2020 highlights the banking industry\u2019s collective ability to sustain unforeseen losses.\n\nCredit rating agency, Moody\u2019s, has also upgraded the global banking industry from negative to stable for the first time since 2023, citing monetary adjustments and interest rate cuts among G-20 countries as reasons behind the upgrade. On December 18, the Federal Reserve announced the third cut for the year, reducing the central bank\u2019s target interest rate by a quarter-point to between 4.25% and 4.5%.\n\nTrump\u2019s victory in the US presidential elections has raised hopes of lax regulations in the financial sector amid growing concerns about antitrust scrutiny and capital requirements slowing down investment banking and lending revenues. While the President-elect has yet to name his picks to head the country\u2019s banking agencies, potential nominees are already hinting at pulling back regulations.\n\nFinancial analysts believe reduced oversight and a business-friendly environment are likely to drive revenues and loan growth and improve banks\u2019 bottom line. At the same time, they also warn of the risks ongoing geopolitical conflicts can have on the general outlook of the global economy.\n\nIncreasing trade tensions, with growing protectionist policies can also hurt investment flows in 2025. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase costs for manufacturers. The 78-year-old last month also threatened the EU with tariffs if it does not buy more oil and gas from the United States.",

The result beat Wall Street profit projections of $4.09 a share, according to the data firm FactSet. Total managed revenue hit $43.7 billion, up 10% from $39.9 billion a year ago. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $41.9 billion.\n\nJPMorgan posted a record $54 billion profit for the year, or $18.22 per share, adjusted for one-time expenses.\n\nYet interest income fell 3% to $23.5 billion, driven lower by lower interest rates.\n\nJPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the bank got a boost from investment banking business, where fees rose 49% and markets revenue jumped 21%.\n\nThe bank's consumer banking business also thrived, with clients opening nearly 2 million checking accounts.\n\nThe New York bank set aside $2.6 billion to cover bad loans, down slightly from the same period a year ago.\n\nJPMorgan shares rose 2% to close Wednesday at $252.35.\n\nWells Fargo also topped profit expectations Wednesday with a nearly 50% jump in net income, with earnings of $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter, or $1.43 per share. Revenue came in at $20.4 billion, a touch lower than expectations. In the same quarter a year ago, Wells posted net income of $3.4 billion, or 86 cents per share, on $20.5 billion in revenue.\n\nIn September, Wells Fargo agreed to work with U.S. bank regulators to shore up its financial crimes risk management, including internal controls related to suspicious activity and money laundering. The agreement came just seven months after the Biden administration lifted a consent order on the bank that had been in place since 2016 after a series of scandals, including the opening of fake customer accounts.\n\nWells rose 4.9% before markets opened.\n\nJPMorgan's Dimon said the U.S. economy remains strong, noting the nation's low unemployment and strong consumer spending.\n\n\"Businesses are more optimistic about the economy, and they are encouraged by expectations for a more pro-growth agenda and improved collaboration between government and business,\" he said, alluding to an incoming Trump administration that has promised to cut regulations across industries.\n\nDimon said that any regulation should balance promoting growth and keeping the banking system safe. \"This is not about weakening regulation ... but rather about setting rules that are transparent, fair and holistic in their approach and based on rigorous data analysis, so that banks can play their critical role in the economy and markets.\"\n\nDimon, however, said that the state of geopolitics \"remains the most dangerous and complicated since World War II\" and that JPMorgan is preparing for a wide range of outcomes.\n\nJPMorgan announced this week that Dimon's top deputy, Daniel Pinto, would step away from his position as president and chief operating officer at the end of June and retire at the end of 2026. Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of the bank's commercial and investment bank division, will take over the COO role with Pinto's guidance.\n\nAfter Dimon hinted last spring that he expected to retire within five years, it was presumed that Pinto, who has worked for the bank for more than 40 years, would take over as the bank's top executive.\n\nA spokesman for the bank said Tuesday that Piepszak was not currently interested in the CEO role when Dimon exits, potentially opening the door for another of the bank's executive leadership to fill the role when it eventually opens.\n\nCitigroup shares climbed 6.5% and Goldman Sachs gained 6% after both banks beat Wall Street profit forecasts.",

            "content": "Haris Karonis Nick Paleologos/Bloomberg\n\nJPMorgan Chase has filed fresh lawsuits totaling about $943 million stemming from its investment in Viva Wallet, the latest legal salvo in a long-running dispute between the bank and Greek technology mogul Haris Karonis.\n\nThe bank contends Viva's managers deprived JPMorgan of the value of its investment. This is significant because the agreement with Karonis allows JPMorgan to take full control of Viva in June if the fintech's valuation is below 5 billion euros, or about $5.3 billion.\n\nThe new suit named Karonis, who is the CEO of Viva, and other executives. In a related case, the bank sued Werealize.com, Karonis' company, which owns 51% of Viva Wallet. JPMorgan owns the rest.\n\n\"We are disappointed that since the firm's investment in 2022, WRL has repeatedly and persistently sought to undermine JPM's rights by breaching the agreement that formed the basis of the firm's investment. These actions harm not only Viva but also Greece's attractiveness for future significant investments. We now look to the courts to enforce the contract terms agreed upon between us,\" a JPMorgan spokesperson said in an email.\n\nKaronis countered JPMorgan's complaint.\n\n\"[The JPM lawsuits] are simply the latest step in JPM's concerted effort to depreciate Viva's value, preclude it from expanding in the United States and elsewhere in competition with JPM , and ensure that Viva's directors do not feel free or able to take steps that are in Viva's best interests but with which JPM disagrees,\" Karonis said in an email.\n\nJPMorgan in 2022 first invested in Viva Wallet , an Athens-based company that sells bill pay, virtual payment cards and merchant credit in about two dozen European countries. The investment was designed to boost the bank's merchant services business in the region by addressing processing challenges within the European Union. Despite sharing a common currency, payment acceptance varies in different European countries, creating a fragmented market for merchant acquiring.\n\nThe partnership created an additional opportunity for JPMorgan to improve its ability to offer short-term credit to merchants backed by future payment flows \u2014 a similar product that fintechs such as Block and PayPal offer in the U.S., Europe and other regions to compete with established banks such as JPMorgan . Viva's range of payments and financial services includes banking licenses Viva acquired in 2020 from Praxia Bank, a Greek financial institution, enhancing Viva's ability to offer banking products and making it an attractive partner to JPMorgan . Viva received funding to fuel its own expansion as part of the deal.\n\nThe terms of the JPMorgan /Viva investment were not disclosed at the time, but Nasdaq, Reuters and other media outlets reported JPMorgan's stake was $1.1 billion and Viva's valuation was $2 billion.\n\nViva's current valuation is unclear. A London judge in 2024 issued a ruling that set parameters on determining Viva's valuation and was an attempt to bring closure to the legal dispute. But with the June deadline fast approaching, the two firms are no closer to an agreement.\n\nIn earlier interviews, payment experts told American Banker the troubled relationship was a cautionary tale resulting from the complexities of bank/fintech partnerships. By courting an investment from a large U.S. bank, Viva Wallet was accepting funding from a partner that it was also competing with for merchant clients. Analysts additionally noted the valuation deadline that enables JPMorgan to take total control of Viva is unusual for bank/fintech collaborations. \u2014John Adams\n\nChris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\n\nLatin American fintech dLocal's international ambitions get boost\n\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has granted dLocal an authorized payment institution license, enabling the Uruguay-based company to offer cross-border payments, fraud controls and other digital transaction services to users in the United Kingdom.\n\ndLocal sells technology that links merchants to emerging markets, enabling those merchants to manage both sides of the transaction without having to forge relationships with local merchant acquirers in different countries.\n\nThe FCA nod gives dLocal the ability to reach U.K. merchants that want to tap e-commerce markets in Latin America and other emerging economies, covering more than 900 payment methods. dLocal recently named co-founder Serio Fogel as its chief strategy officer while the company seeks ways to combat cross-border payment rivals such as Tipalti, Ripple, Block and PayPal.\n\nIn addition to covering its bases by connecting merchants in different markets, dLocal is looking to reach companies and gig economy workers who want to make cross-currency payments. \u2014John Adams\n\nAdobe Stock\n\nGoldman Sachs invests in Canadian B2B payment firm\n\nWith B2B payments emerging as a key issue for banks, Goldman Sachs has led a 70 million Canadian dollar (about $50 million) round in Float Financial, a Toronto-based firm that sells a range of financial products to business clients.\n\nGoldman's investment follows an expansion program at Float that added automation to accounts payable, corporate reimbursements and analysis of corporate spending. Launched in 2021, Float offers virtual and physical payments cards denominated in both Canadian and U.S. dollars as well as high-yield accounts and fund transfers. Float has about 4,000 clients and intends to use the new capital to recruit staff.\n\nThe firm is positioning itself as a rival to firms such as Brex, Marqeta and Ramp . \u2014John Adams\n\nLuke MacGregor/Bloomberg\n\nChainalysis acquires Israeli fintech to address emerging threats\n\nBlockchain analytics firm Chainalysis has acquired Alterya, a Tel Aviv-based fraud security firm, to respond to the threat that generative AI poses to financial security.\n\nChainalysis plans to use Alterya's assets to support fraud detection for real-time payments and provide anti-money-laundering solutions for blockchain firms, digital wallets and crypto exchanges. Alterya's clients include Binance, Coinbase, Block and financial institutions, and it monitors about $8 billion in payments per month in both crypto and traditional currency.\n\nThe growth of Gen AI makes financial fraud difficult to prevent, Chainalysis said, contending the technology helps scammers produce fake content and identities that can deceive users to authorize payments under false pretenses. That makes it harder for banks and fintechs to detect when fraudsters are monetizing through crypto and real-time payment networks, the firm said in a release . \u2014John Adams\n\nBloomberg Creative Photos/Bloomberg\n\nU.K. opens CBDC lab but no final decision on digital pound\n\nThe Bank of England plans to launch a Digital Pound Lab to experiment with technology that supports a central bank digital currency.\n\nThe Bank of England is consulting with industry and academic experts to build a model for a U.K. CBDC. That includes technology, operational issues, commercial use cases, regulatory requirements for and the rule that public and private sector stakeholders will play.\n\nA digital pound, if approved by Parliament, would likely split management responsibilities, with the central bank operating the ledger and commercial banks supporting the CBDC's infrastructure and managing public-facing tasks and data management.

Square envisions users of Square Card in the U.K. will particularly benefit from the Salt partnership, accessing Salt's open banking compliance product to share data with banks and other providers through application programming interfaces.\n\nThis will enable businesses to access financial services and personalized insights into their consumer's payment trends.\n\n\"Square Card is a new product for us in the U.K. and an important solution for small businesses to manage cash flow, which we know is often the biggest blocker for starting and growing a business,\" said Samina Hussain-Letch, executive director of Square UK, in a release. \u2014John Adams\n\nPayPal, Latin American firm collaborate on payment orchestration\n\nColombian payment technology company Yuno has entered a strategic collaboration with PayPal to expand the reach of Yuno's payment orchestration platform.\n\nPayment orchestration refers to routing a transaction to the best processing option based on factors such as expense and settlement time.

            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 JPMorgan\u2019s net income soared 50% to more than $14 billion in the fourth quarter as the bank\u2019s profit and revenue easily beat Wall Street forecasts, and other major banks reported banner earnings for the year as businesses and consumers continued to spend despite elevated interest rates.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s earnings per share rose to $4.81 from $3.04 a year ago. The result beat Wall Street profit projections of $4.09 a share, according to the data firm FactSet. Total managed revenue hit $43.7 billion, up 10%, from $39.9 billion a year ago. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $41.9 billion.\n\nJPMorgan posted a record $54 billion profit for the year, or $18.22 per share, adjusted for one-time expenses.\n\nJPMorgan shares rose just less than 1% in morning trading.\n\nCitigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs also issued strong results on Wednesday.\n\nThe country\u2019s biggest banks have benefitted from higher interest rates for the last two years, when the Federal Reserve jacked up rates to combat the inflation that took root in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe government\u2019s latest consumer prices report, also issued Wednesday, showed that prices for many essentials rose, pushing the consumer price index to 2.9% in December, the highest it has been since July. But underlying inflation trends \u2014 watched closely by the Fed \u2014 slowed to 3.2% in December, better than analysts expected and a good sign for consumers and the broader economy.\n\nThat, combined with the strong bank earnings, boosted markets, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials each climbing 1.7% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq gaining 2.2%.\n\nAs great as 2024 was for markets, bank stocks did even better, despite the Federal Reserve trimming its benchmark interest rate three times between September and December.\n\nWhen it issued its last cut in December, the Fed also trimmed its forecast for 2025 rate cuts to two from four as inflation remained stubbornly above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. That sent markets into a mini-slump, but not enough to dampen what was a spectacular 2024 run. The S&P gained 23% last year, the Nasdaq climbed more than 28% and the Dow finished up nearly 13%.\n\nAs for the banks, Goldman Sachs shares finished 2024 48% higher, while JPMorgan enjoyed a 41% gain and Wells Fargo shares climbed 43%.\n\nJPMorgan reported Wednesday that its interest income fell 3% to $23.5 billion, thanks to a downtick in interest rates.\n\nCEO Jamie Dimon said the bank got a boost from investment banking business, where fees rose 49% and markets revenue jumped 21%. The bank\u2019s consumer banking business also thrived, with clients opening nearly 2 million checking accounts.\n\nThe New York bank set aside $2.6 billion to cover bad loans, down slightly from the same period a year ago.\n\nDimon said the U.S. economy remains strong, noting the nation\u2019s low unemployment and strong consumer spending.\n\n\u201cBusinesses are more optimistic about the economy, and they are encouraged by expectations for a more pro-growth agenda and improved collaboration between government and business,\u201d said, alluding to the incoming Trump administration which has promised to cut regulations across industries.\n\nDimon said that any regulation should balance promoting growth and keeping the banking system safe.\n\n\u201cThis is not about weakening regulation ... but rather about setting rules that are transparent, fair and holistic in their approach and based on rigorous data analysis, so that banks can play their critical role in the economy and markets.\u201d\n\nDimon, however, said that the state of the geopolitics \u201cremains the most dangerous and complicated since World War II\u201d and that JPMorgan is preparing for a wide range of outcomes.\n\nJPMorgan announced this week that Dimon\u2019s top deputy, Daniel Pinto, would step away from his position as president and chief operating officer at the end of June and retire at the end of 2026. Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of the bank\u2019s commercial and investment bank division, will take over the COO role with Pinto\u2019s guidance.\n\nAfter Dimon said last spring that he expected to retire within five years, it was presumed that Pinto, who has worked for the bank for more than 40 years, would take over as the bank\u2019s top executive.\n\nA spokesman for the bank said Tuesday that Piepszak was not currently interested in the CEO role when Dimon exits, potentially opening the door for another of the bank\u2019s executive leadership to fill the role when it eventually opens.\n\nWells Fargo also topped profit expectations Wednesday with a nearly 50% jump in net income, to $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter, or $1.43 per share. Revenue came in at $20.4 billion, a touch lower than expectations. In the same quarter a year ago, Wells earned $3.4 billion, or 86 cents per share, on $20.5 billion in revenue.\n\nIn September, Wells Fargo agreed to work with U.S. bank regulators to shore up its financial crimes risk management, including internal controls related to suspicious activity and money laundering. The agreement came just seven months after the Biden Administration lifted a consent order on the bank that had been in place since 2016 following a series of scandals, including the opening of fake customer accounts.\n\nWells rose 5.3% in early trading.\n\nCitigroup climbed 5.7% and Goldman Sachs gained 5.4% after both banks beat Wall Street profit forecasts. Goldman said its global banking and markets business generated nearly $35 billion in revenue, driven by strong performances from equities and investment banking.\n\nGoldman claimed to lead all global firms in mergers and acquisitions in 2024.",

So while it paid the largest FDIC assessment among its peers a year ago to shore up the deposit insurance fund, it was also a major winner from the regional banking crisis, gaining even more deposits and assets in the tumult.\n\nFixed income trading revenue jumped 20% to $5 billion, topping the $4.42 billion StreetAcount estimate on rising credit and currency results. Equities revenue climbed 22% to $2 billion, missing the $2.37 billion estimate and underperforming the firm's rivals at Goldman Sachs .\n\nInvestment banking fees jumped 49% to $2.48 billion, topping the $2.39 billion estimate.\n\nCEO Jamie Dimon said in the release that the economy was \"resilient,\" buoyed by low unemployment and healthy consumer spending, as well as optimism for the Trump administration's pro-growth agenda.\n\n\"However, two significant risks remain,\" Dimon said. \"Ongoing and future spending requirements will likely be inflationary, and therefore, inflation may persist for some time. Additionally, geopolitical conditions remain the most dangerous and complicated since World War II. As always, we hope for the best but prepare the firm for a wide range of scenarios.\"\n\nOn a call with reporters, CFO Jeremy Barnum said that net interest income for 2025 would be about $94 billion.\n\nBanks ended the year with several reasons to be bullish: Wall Street activity has picked up at the same time that Main Street consumers remain resilient, while the election victory of Donald Trump has led to hopes of regulatory relief.\n\nWhile the business is thriving, analysts will likely ask Dimon about his succession planning after his No. 2 executive, Daniel Pinto, said he was stepping down as chief operating officer in June. Dimon signaled last year that he was likely to step down as CEO within five years.\n\nAnother question is how the changing outlook for Federal Reserve rate cuts will impact the bank across its sweeping operations. While Fed officials expect two more cuts this year, economic indicators could cause them to pause.\n\nFinally, analysts may press JPMorgan on what it intends to do with a possible windfall of capital if Trump regulators present a gentler version of the Basel 3 Endgame, as potential nominees have supported. Dimon said last May that share buybacks would be muted because the stock was expensive, but they've only climbed since.\n\nBesides JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs , Wells Fargo and Citigroup are also out with quarterly and full-year results Wednesday, while Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are due to report Thursday.",

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\u201cWhy not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so?\u201d Mayo asked.\n\nDimon said, \"We're on a path. The path is not just about me. It's about the other senior people in the company. It's about the board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be chairman of that, it's going to be up to the board.

            "content": "JPMorgan Chase named Jennifer Piepszak its chief operating officer, effective immediately, the bank said Tuesday in a press release.\n\nJennifer Piepszak Retrieved from JPMorgan Chase on January 14, 2025\n\nShe replaces Daniel Pinto, the bank\u2019s longtime No. 2 executive, who will retire at the end of 2026, the bank said.\n\nBut with the new role, Piepszak is effectively taking herself out of the running to succeed Jamie Dimon as CEO.\n\n\u201cJenn has made clear her preference for a senior operating role working closely with Jamie and in support of the leadership team going forward and said she does not want to be considered for the CEO position at this time,\u201d spokesman Joe Evangelisti told CNBC. \u201cShe is deeply committed to the future of the company and our team and wants to help in any way she can.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo and Piper Sandler analysts each emphasized the \u201cat this time\u201d portion of that statement in notes to clients Tuesday. Piper Sandler said the caveat made Tuesday\u2019s transition less clear, while Wells Fargo asserted that Piepszak should not be counted out of the CEO race.\n\nTuesday\u2019s moves raised the profile of Doug Petno, JPMorgan\u2019s co-head of global banking. Petno will succeed Piepszak as co-CEO of JPMorgan\u2019s commercial and investment bank, alongside Troy Rohrbaugh, the bank said. That effectively puts Petno in the race to succeed Dimon.\n\nJohn Simmons, JPMorgan\u2019s head of commercial banking, will succeed Petno as co-head of global banking, alongside Filippo Gori, the bank said.\n\nPiepszak and Marianne Lake had been front-runners to become the next CEO of the nation\u2019s largest bank ever since a 2021 executive shuffle made them co-heads of consumer and community banking for JPMorgan. Another shuffle last January left Lake solely in charge of that unit and shifted Piepszak to the commercial and investment bank, which she led with Rohrbaugh.\n\nJPMorgan specified Tuesday that Lake\u2019s role would not change, nor would that of asset and wealth management chief Mary Erdoes, another of the bank\u2019s high-profile women executives.\n\nPinto, meanwhile, will relinquish his responsibilities as president and COO by June 30 and move into a vice chair role with the bank.\n\n\u201cDaniel is a first-class person who I am proud to call a friend, and he has made a truly significant impact on our company for more than 40 years,\u201d Dimon said in a statement Tuesday. \u201c[He\u2019s] done a truly exceptional job in every role he has played at our firm. I can\u2019t thank him enough for his partnership and outstanding stewardship as President and COO, and for building the best, most respected Corporate & Investment Bank in the world.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s moves leave unanswered the central question: When will Dimon retire? The 68-year-old CEO, who has led JPMorgan for 19 years, would ritually tell analysts, when asked: \u201cFive years.\u201d That retort changed slightly last May, when Dimon said the timetable \u201cisn\u2019t five years anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cJamie Dimon is a tough act to follow, even though he's done a great job shuffling top executives around to gain more experience,\" David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, told Reuters. \"But, when a CEO is at the helm for so long, many of his proteges get older and would prefer to ride off into the sunset than take on a position that they're likely expected to [hold] for a decade.\"\n\nPinto, who began his career at one of JPMorgan\u2019s predecessors in 1983, had been seen as the bank\u2019s go-to executive in case of emergency. He and now-retired co-president Gordon Smith ran JPMorgan in March 2020 as Dimon recovered from heart surgery.\n\nIn a statement, Pinto said he is \u201cvery proud of the team here at JPMorgan Chase, the company we have built and all we have achieved along the way. I will continue to support our company in any way I can and am excited about the firm\u2019s bright future.\u201d\n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s shuffle undoubtedly points the spotlight to JPMorgan\u2019s other players.\n\n\u201cWe are fortunate to have developed an exceptional team of world-class executives, each of whom has contributed significantly to the success of our company,\u201d Dimon said Tuesday. \u201cI want to congratulate Jennifer, Doug and John on their expanded roles. I have never been more proud and optimistic about our company, in large part because of the extraordinary efforts of these leaders and our other members of the Operating Committee and executive team.",

All Corporate functions will be managed jointly by Piepszak and Dimon.\n\nDimon said, \u201cDaniel Pinto has done a truly exceptional job in every role he has played at our firm. I can\u2019t thank him enough for his partnership and outstanding stewardship as President and COO, and for building the best, most respected Corporate & Investment Bank in the world.

The shares closed Friday at around $240.\n\n\n\nJPMorgan is expected to report $11.92 billion in quarterly net income, a gain of nearly 30% from the same time last year on $41.49 billion in revenue, up 7.5% year-over-year.\n\nThe bank's net interest income is expected to decline to $22.93 billion from $24.05 billion a year ago, as the bank feels the impact of high deposit costs for another quarter before lower interest rates help bring deposit costs down.\n\nQ4 Follows Estimate-Beating First Three Quarters\n\nJPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, largely beat estimates in its first three quarters of the fiscal year.\n\nThe bank's NII missed estimates in the first quarter, but revenue and profits consistently beat estimates as asset management and investment banking revenue surged.\n\nMarket watchers will also be paying attention to any comments from JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon on the bank's succession plan, projections for the next fiscal year, and its expectations for the economy under president-elect Donald Trump's second term.\n\nJPMorgan shares fell Friday, leaving them up about 40% over the past 12 months. They're about 1% higher in Monday trading.",

            "content": "Loan demand has been anemic in recent quarters, with industry data suggesting loan growth of about +1.8% in December, the best rate in over a year. Also notable is that the growth isn\u2019t solely resulting from credit cards, with commercial & industrial loans (C&I) starting to show positive growth.\n\nThe bond market\u2019s immediate reaction to the aforementioned blockbuster December jobs report has been to relatively reduce the yield curve\u2019s steepness, but it nevertheless remains far steeper than a few months back. This is positive for net interest income (NII) for these banks, with everything else being constant. There is likely further upside to current 2025 NII estimates, particularly if deposit and loan growth accelerates.\n\nThe development of elevated, longer-dated treasury yields has been an active discussion point in the market, as it seemingly runs counter to the easing monetary policy trajectory. We tend to agree with the view that the ongoing strength in long-term treasury yields is primarily a reflection of favorable economic growth expectations and rising demand for capital due to investment opportunities in secular growth areas like artificial intelligence. Part of it is tied to sticky inflation expectations, but the economic growth angle represents the most significant component.\n\nThe outlook for Fed easing that had already dampened following the \u2018hawkish cut\u2019 in December is likely to moderate further following the latest blockbuster jobs report. That said, the overall operating environment for these banks has significantly improved lately on the back of a favorable macroeconomic outlook and a relatively more permissive regulatory regime under President Trump.\n\nWells Fargo , which joins JPMorgan in kicking off the Q4 earnings season for the Finance sector on Wednesday, January 15 th , is barely in positive territory since election day, while Citigroup , which also reports the same day, has outperformed both of its peers.\n\nJPMorgan shares are down a little over -3% since their late-November highs, marginally better than the Zacks Finance sector but lagging the broader market that is essentially flat over the same period. Since the November elections, however, JPMorgan shares are up close to +2%, while the S&P 500 index is modestly in the negative.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWith respect to credit quality, the problems in the commercial real estate (CRE) market are well-known and already adequately provisioned for at the major banks. Beyond CRE, aggregate bankruptcies in the U.S. are up significantly from the Covid-driven low of early 2022, but the growth rate has been leveling off in recent months.\n\nWith current bankruptcy levels roughly 30% below pre-Covid averages, the recent slowing of the bankruptcy growth pace is likely indicative of improved household balance sheets. We also see this trend in early-stage credit card delinquencies, with the flat year-over-year growth rates in recent months indicative of favorable developments concerning net charge-off rates this year.\n\nConcerning investment banking, revenues should be up in the mid-teens percentage range, with JPMorgan and other industry leaders likely enjoying gains in excess of +20%. The equity capital markets business has been particularly strong, with decent gains on the debt capital market side and some early signs of life in the M&A space. On the trading side, volumes were up strong in Q4, while fixed income, currencies, and commodities (FICC) volumes improved during the period after the flattish showing in the first three quarters of the year.\n\nExpectations for JPMorgan, Wells Fargo & Citigroup\n\nJPMorgan is expected to report $4.02 per share in earnings (up +1.3% year-over-year) on $40.9 billion in revenues (up +6.1% YoY). The stock was up nicely on the last earnings release on October 11th, reflecting positive commentary about the outlook. Estimates have been steadily increasing, with the current $4.02 per share estimate up from $3.82 a month ago and $3.79 three months back.\n\nWells Fargo is expected to report EPS of $1.34 (up +3.9% year-over-year) on $20.5 billion in revenues (up +0.1% YOY). Estimates for Q4 have inched up since the period got underway, with the current $1.34 estimate up from $1.32 a month back and $1.30 three months back. Wells Fargo shares were up following the last quarterly release on October 11th.\n\nFor Citigroup, the expectation is of $1.24 per share in earnings (up +47.6% YOY) on $19.6 billion in revenues (up +12.1%). The revisions trend has been modestly positive, with analysts nudging their estimates higher since the quarter began. Citi shares were down following the last quarterly release. But the market\u2019s reaction to any Citi quarterly release is more a function of the market\u2019s assessment of management\u2019s progress in repositioning the business and simplifying the structure than actual quarterly results. We don\u2019t think this report will be any different in that respect.\n\nThe Zacks Major Banks industry, of which JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are a part, is expected to earn +4.4% higher earnings in 2024 Q4 on +3.3% higher revenues. Please note that this industry brought in roughly 50% of the Zacks Finance sector\u2019s total earnings over the trailing four-quarter period.\n\nQ4 earnings for the Zacks Finance sector are expected to be up +11.3% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues.\n\nDespite the big bank stocks\u2019 outperformance over the past year, they are still cheap on most conventional valuation metrics.\n\nAt first glance, this valuation picture may look full, if not rich. But we must see the group\u2019s valuation multiple relative to the broader market.\n\nLooking relative to the S&P 500 index, the Zacks Major Banks industry is currently trading at 66% of the S&P 500 forward 12-month P/E multiple. Over the last 10 years, the industry has traded as high as 78% of the index, as low as 52%, and carries a median of 62%.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThe Q4 earnings season will take center stage with the bank results this week. However, the reporting cycle has actually gotten underway, with results from 22 S&P 500 index members. These 22 index members, including bellwether operators such as FedEx, Nike, Oracle, and others, have reported results for their fiscal quarters ending in November. We and other data aggregators count these fiscal November-quarter results as part of the December-quarter tally.\n\nThis week brings Q4 results from 18 S&P 500 members, which, in addition to the aforementioned big banks, include UnitedHealthcare, Schlumberger, Fastenal, and others.\n\nTotal earnings for the 22 index members that have reported results are up +22% from the same period last year on +5.5% higher revenues, with 72.7% beating EPS estimates and 68.2% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Broad-Based Growth Expected in 2025\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nJoin us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/\n\nZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

So, let's analyze how we can structure an option trade that fits the view that 1) we think JPMorgan stock will stay within the expected range and 2) the response to the earnings report is likely to be positive.\n\nTaking the at-the-money put and call for the Jan. 17 expiration, we can see that the expected range is 3.8%. Now that we know the expected range, let's find a bull put spread that has a break-even price roughly 3.8% below the stock price.\n\nJPMorgan Stock Today: The Trade\n\nSelling the Jan. 17, 230-strike put and buying the 225 put would create a bull put spread.\n\nThis spread is trading for around $0.65, based on recent trading. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $65 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $435.\n\nThat represents a 14.9% return on risk between now and the end of the week if JPMorgan stock remains above 230.\n\nIf JPMorgan stock closes below 225 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $435.\n\nThe break-even point for the bull put spread is 229.35, which is calculated as 230 less the 0.65 option premium per contract.\n\nRisk And Reward\n\nThere is little room for adjustment with short-term trades such as this held over earnings.\n\nA 14.9% return in a few days would be nice, but the possibility of losing 100% is also very real. As such, this style of trade is only for traders with a high risk tolerance and a bullish outlook for the stock.\n\nAccording to IBD Stock Checkup, JPMorgan stock is ranked seventh in its group and has a IBD Composite Rating of 89, an EPS Rating of 72, and a Relative Strength Rating of 87.\n\nPlease remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.\n\nThis article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation.

Again, that is up to the board, not up to me. But if it makes sense, I may be chairing for a couple of years,\u201d the 68-year-old Dimon said during an interview with Lesley Stahl on \u201cCBS News Sunday Morning.\u201d\n\n4 In the interview with CBS, Dimon hinted that he is \u201clikely\u201d to stay at JPMorgan as chairman once he eventually steps down as CEO.\n\n4 Dimon sat down with CBS\u2019 Lesley Stahl for the interview. CBS\n\nThe Queens native, who has led the bank since 2006, downplayed talk of any possible political ambitions when pressed by Stahl about his retirement plans, insisting he planned to write a book or teach.\n\nDimon also appeared to throw his weight behind Trump\u2019s threat to use tariffs to put pressure on countries to resolve spats with the US.\n\n\u201cTariffs are a way, are a tool \u2014 if properly used \u2014 that can help get some of those issues resolved \u2014 unfair competition, national security issues. Like any tool if it is misused, it can do damage too,\u201d Dimon told Stahl.\n\nHe added that he was \u201ccautiously pessimistic\u201d about the future of the US economy despite lower inflation and improving job numbers.\n\n4 The Post revealed exclusively that Dimon had been used as \u201ca sounding board\u201d for Trump\u2019s top aides as they crafted the incoming commander-in-chief\u2019s economic policies. Getty Images\n\nHis comments come ahead of JPMorgan\u2019s full-year results, which will be released Wednesday, amid an ongoing rebound in deal-making and lucrative investment banking fees.\n\nDimon\u2019s future has been the subject of furious speculation. Reports surfaced during the election cycle that Dimon was eyeing a job in a potential Kamala Harris administration \u2014 before he ruled himself out.\n\nDonald Trump floated his name as a possible Treasury Secretary pick in an interview with Bloomberg in June, only to disavow his own words just weeks later.\n\nIn November, The Post exclusively reported that the president-elect and Dimon had established a secret \u201cback channel\u201d in which Trump used the banking veteran as a \u201csounding board\u201d for his economic policies.\n\nDimon regularly held calls with a close-knit group of Trump\u2019s inner circle to discuss everything from banking regulation to taxes but formally ruled out joining his administration in October, The Post reported.\n\nThe race to replace the Wall Street titan has long been a subject of discussions among New York\u2019s financial elite. Dimon has not given a timetable for when he would step aside.\n\n4 Erdoes, 57, is one of the names in the frame to take over as JPMorgan CEO when Dimon calls it a day in the bank\u2019s top job. Getty Images\n\nThose reportedly being considered to eventually replace Dimon include Mary Erdoes, the head of JPMorgan\u2019s asset wealth management division, Jennifer Piepszak, who is co-CEO of the company\u2019s investment bank division, as well as her counterpart Troy Rohrbaugh.\n\nThe Post revealed in July how Erdoes, 57, represented the bank at a swanky VIP lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee, his official residence, this past summer.\n\nDimon, who pulled down a salary of $34.5 million in 2023, turned on the Biden administration in recent months, lashing out at what he sees as ill-conceived rules that are hobbling JP Morgan\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to fight back,\u201d Dimon told stunned bankers at a conference in New York this past October. \u201cI\u2019ve had it with this s\u2013t.\u201d\n\nHe singled out a blueprint aimed at helping banks absorb major economic shocks by forcing them to hold more capital on their balance sheets to weather any financial storms.\n\nThe proposal, known as Basel III, would see major lenders raise that emergency buffer by 9%.\n\n\u201cWe are suing our regulators over and over and over because things are becoming unfair and unjust, and they are hurting companies, a lot of these rules are hurting lower-paid individuals,\u201d he said at the time.",

While some comments remain visible, the discussion has been largely shut down.\n\nEmployees have also taken to social media to express their opposition to the new policy, with some suggesting the need for unionization to advocate for a hybrid work arrangement.\n\nIn the memo, executives acknowledged that while many prefer hybrid schedules, the decision was made to reinforce a full-time in-office approach, which they believe is essential for the company\u2019s operation.\n\nJPMorgan is not alone in this trend, as other companies such as Amazon are also implementing similar mandates after a period of flexible working policies implemented during the pandemic.\n\nExecutives at JPMorgan indicated that affected employees would receive a 30-day notice prior to returning to the office full time, with limited remote work options available under specific circumstances.",

Such robust growth, which has contributed to inflation remaining above 2%, may lead the Fed to halt rate cuts sooner than expected. This makes a dollar weakening unlikely in the short term.\u201d\n\nShould the Fed continue to pursue its easing cycle, JPMorgan says rate cuts will likely be minimal this year due to a strong US economy.\n\n\u201cThe increasing divergence in global growth has led to a greater disparity in central bank policies worldwide\u2026 These differentials may remain elevated, as markets are currently pricing in only a limited number of Fed cuts next year [amounting to] 44bps (basis points), compared to 110bps for the ECB (European Central Bank) and rate hikes of 47bps in Japan.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan also says President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposed policy changes could send the US dollar higher.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming administration\u2019s focus on boosting domestic manufacturing, increasing tariffs and deregulating industries could spur business growth and sustain higher interest rates, supporting the dollar.\u201d\n\nBut while the largest bank in the US is bullish on the dollar, it says the country\u2019s excessive reliance on foreign-made products could stifle USD\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.\u2019s persistent trade balance deficit, at 4.2% of GDP as of September 2024, poses a long-term constraint, highlighting a structural challenge that could eventually pressure the currency.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against the other best financial stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nAccording to the Business Research Company, the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years.\n\nThe year 2024 was remarkable for the financial sector, as seen by the Financial Sector Index, which rose over 30% as of mid-December and outperformed the broader market by almost 5 percentage points. This expansion came after worries over mid-sized bank failures in early 2024, which turned out to be isolated events rather than a problem affecting the entire industry.\n\nAs of January 7, 2025, the market\u2019s financial sector produced returns of 5.51% over three years, 9.68% over five years, and 9.49% over ten years. These numbers, however, pale in comparison to the sector\u2019s remarkable success during the previous 12 months, which saw a return of 28.01%.\n\nLooking forward, according to Fidelity\u2019s report, the financial industry\u2019s prospects for 2025 seem promising, backed by consistent economic expansion in the United States. It is projected that the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to rate decreases in the second half of 2024 will boost confidence and lower credit risk. Falling rates have the potential to boost lending and deposit growth while also reducing net interest margins.\n\nAs per Fidelity analyst Matt Reed:\n\n\u201cLower rates boost economic momentum, benefiting banks and payment processors alike.\u201d\n\nBanks that are well-diversified and have solid fundamentals are better equipped to handle a soft landing situation. Sensitive to consumer spending, payment processors are likewise poised for expansion as more accommodating monetary policy and strong consumer activity coincide.\n\nRisks still exist, though. As per the aforementioned report, if the economy weakens, some lenders may face difficulties due to their exposure to commercial real estate and possible nonperforming loans. Nonetheless, financials start 2025 with significant momentum due to a less stringent regulatory agenda following the election and more prospects for mergers and acquisitions.\n\nMichael Kantrowitz, chief investment strategist at Piper Sandler stated:\n\n\u201cI think investors have rotated a little bit out of some of the big tech companies and into the big financial companies,\u201d\n\nHe claimed that while a lot of optimism about artificial intelligence (AI) is priced into tech businesses, some investor movement made sense since the rate environment has improved for bank earnings.\n\nDeloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report states that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. According to the report, the baseline scenario for economic growth in 2025 is projected to fall to 1.5%, with possible deviations between 1.0% and 1.9% due to slowing consumer spending, greater unemployment, and sluggish business investment. By Q2 of 2024, consumer debt had risen to $17.7 trillion, and by March 2024, savings from the pandemic had been spent, further straining the economy. Inflation is forecast to be around 2%, allowing for three to four rate cuts, bringing the federal funds rate down to 350-375 basis points. Treasury yields are projected to fall, and following two years of inversion, the yield curve may normalize. With the exception of economies that are under pressure, global central banks will likely choose to cut benchmark rates.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through holdings of financial ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 financial stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:JPM), with assets of around $4.1 trillion, is one of the biggest and most complex financial firms in the US. It is divided into four key segments: consumer and community banking, corporate and investment banking, commercial banking, and asset and wealth management. The company is regulated in many countries where it conducts business.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is perhaps the most dominant bank in the United States, with leading franchises in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, retail banking, and asset and wealth management. Though few other businesses have been able to implement a similar approach, the bank\u2019s combination of scale, diversity, and careful risk control is a straightforward route to competitive advantage. Although even the most effectively managed banks occasionally make errors, the business has appeared to be able to put everything together more effectively and with fewer mistakes than its competitors.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\u2019s Q3 of 2024 revenue increased by 6% year on year to $43.3 billion, led by a rise of 31% YoY in investment banking fees, a 27% YoY increase in equity market revenue, and a 15% YoY increase in asset management fees. While assets under management increased by 23% to $3.9 trillion, consumer card loans increased by 11%. The firm maintained its top spot in retail deposit share for four years in a row. Higher interest rates and the expansion of loans drove the firm\u2019s Q3 2024 net interest income, which increased 30% year over year to $22.9 billion.\n\nGlenn Schorr, an analyst at Evercore ISI, increased his price target for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) from $238 to $264 on January 2, 2025, and maintained his Outperform rating for the company\u2019s shares. The analyst notes that after a \u201cpretty strong\u201d September and October, investment banking activity levels continued to decline into December, and that equity markets sold off by roughly 2% in December in \u201ca post-post-election breather driven largely by the realization\u201d that rate cuts might not be as imminent as thought.\n\nKen Griffin\u2019s Citadel Investment Group was the largest stakeholder in the company among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database. It owns 16.78 million shares worth $3.54 billion as of Q3.\n\nOverall, JPM ranks 4th on our list of the Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.

Many companies began to call staff back to the office as early as 2021.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and counterparts at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been strong advocates of working from the office, saying it fosters better learning, innovation and culture.\n\nMore than half of JPMorgan's employees already come into the office full-time, according to the memo from the bank's operating committee. It has more than 316,000 staff worldwide.\n\n\"Now is the right time to solidify our full-time in-office approach,\" the executives wrote. \"We think it is the best way to run the company.\"\n\nA JPMorgan spokesperson confirmed the contents of the memo but declined to comment further.\n\n\"We know that some of you prefer a hybrid schedule and respectfully understand that not everyone will agree with this decision,\" Dimon and other leaders wrote in the memo. \"Being together greatly enhances mentoring, learning, brainstorming and getting things done.\"\n\nSome JPMorgan staffers pushed back against the return-to-office directive by posting comments on the company's intranet site, according to two sources who saw the posts and declined to be identified discussing personnel matters.\n\nThe complaints cited increased commuting and childcare costs, as well as concerns about mental health and stress, according to one of the sources.\n\nAfter more than 300 comments were posted within the first hour, the page was locked, the second source said.\n\nEssential workers at lenders, including bank branch employees, reported for in-person work throughout the pandemic. JPMorgan called corporate staff back to offices on a rotational basis in mid-2021 after months of pandemic shutdowns, and brought managing directors back to the office full-time in 2023.\n\nThe largest US lender said that employees will be given at least 30 days' notice before they are expected to return to offices full-time. The employees were also directed to seek manager approval if they needed more time to prepare.\n\n\"What is not changing is our support for flexibility in the workplace, which we are committed to providing at every level in a fair way,\" the bank said.\n\nThe memo also included a link to a list of frequently asked questions, giving details about special exceptions for remote work, flexibility for personal reasons and attendance logs.",

In a memo issued by the bank's operating committee, the largest US bank by assets said it was calling all workers back to the office starting in March.\n\n\"Starting in March, we'll be asking most employees currently on a hybrid schedule to return to the office five days a week,\" a copy of the memo obtained by Business Insider said. \"As it stands, more than half of our workforce already comes into the office full-time.\"\n\nA company spokesman said that roughly 70% of the bank's employees were already back in the office five days a week, while everyone else was in three or four days a week.\n\n\"We know that some of you prefer a hybrid schedule and respectfully understand that not everyone will agree with this decision,\" the memo said, adding, \"We think it is the best way to run the company.\"\n\nJPMorgan, which had more than 300,000 employees in September, is the latest in a growing list of large companies to revert to pre-pandemic office norms. AT&T and Amazon have implemented similar five-day mandates starting this month.\n\nJPMorgan's return-to-office policies have been slowly ratcheting up since the COVID-19 pandemic. It returned all managing directors \u2014 the highest rank outside the C-suite \u2014 to a five-day workweek in 2023.\n\nThe full memo sheds some light on the company's rationale:\n\nMessage from the Operating Committee\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nWe're proud of how our company has successfully adapted and thrived in an ever-changing environment, and this is thanks to all of you. We are a better organization because of your commitment and continued care for our customers, clients, communities and each other. Developing effective teams and maintaining a vibrant, healthy culture are clearly key for our success \u2014 and we believe best achieved through working together in person. This is why starting in March, we'll be asking most employees currently on a hybrid schedule to return to the office five days a week. As it stands, more than half of our workforce already comes into the office full-time.\n\nWe know that some of you prefer a hybrid schedule and respectfully understand that not everyone will agree with this decision. We are now a few years out of the pandemic and have had the time to evaluate the benefits and challenges of remote and hybrid working. We feel that now is the right time to solidify our full-time in-office approach. We think it is the best way to run the company. As we've discussed before, the benefits of working together in person are substantial and irreplaceable, and as we spend more time together, the more advantages we gain. Being together greatly enhances mentoring, learning, brainstorming and getting things done. It accelerates decision-making and offers valuable opportunities for spontaneous learning and creativity. It also allows our early career professionals to learn through our apprenticeship model and expand their networks by building connections with peers across the firm.\n\nMany of our global locations, but not all, have existing capacity to allow for most or all employees to return to the office full-time in early March. We will confirm the list of locations where this is possible by the end of January. The evaluation of our locations will focus on operational readiness, including food services, cleaning and parking. For locations with capacity constraints, or where changes are needed to create capacity, we will work through plans in the coming weeks and will share information and timelines as they become available on a location-by-location basis. Until your location's readiness is confirmed, you should continue on your current work schedule. It's important to note that following a thorough review and applying stringent criteria, a few specific teams whose work can be easily and clearly measured will continue to work remotely or on a hybrid schedule. These decisions have been made in the best interest of the company. If you are on one of these teams, your manager will confirm your schedule.\n\nWe recognize that switching from hybrid to five days a week in the office may be disruptive and require adjustments for some colleagues. Importantly we will work to give you at least 30 days' notice in line with local requirements, prior to your full-time return. Once your location is ready, if you need a bit more time to accommodate the new schedule, you should discuss your needs with your manager and get their approval. We know that a lot has changed in our workplaces since returning to the office after the pandemic and recognize that it will take us some time to get all of our locations ready to accommodate a five-day-a-week schedule.\n\nWhat is not changing is our support for flexibility in the workplace, which we are committed to providing at every level in a fair way. We fully recognize how important it is to be able to work remotely as life events happen, and managers will be directed to provide team members with the flexibility they need to work remotely under some circumstances, such as unexpected occurrences, family commitments or other times on occasion when you and your manager agree you can work away from the office. As always, we expect you to continue to track your time out of the office, and we will work hard to support a workplace of flexibility and collaboration.\n\nWe greatly appreciate your outstanding efforts day-in and day-out and are honored to work together on behalf of everyone we serve.",

Morgan Chase and Greece\u2019s Viva Wallet is not over.\n\nThe Wall Street banking giant has filed a pair of lawsuits related to its investment in the FinTech, Reuters reported Wednesday (Jan. 8). It marks the latest chapter in an ongoing disagreement between the companies over the value of Viva Wallet.\n\nThe Reuters report, citing a source with knowledge of the matter, said J.P. Morgan filed a suit in Greece last week seeking $944 million and claiming that Viva founder and CEO Haris Karonis, and three other executives \u201cdeprived JPMorgan of the value of its 2022 investment in Viva through unlawful actions from March 2022 onwards.\u201dV\n\nViva confirmed the suits in a statement from Karonis provided to PYMNTS\n\n\u201cThese proceedings are simply the latest step in J.P. Morgan\u2019s concerted effort to depreciate Viva\u2019s value, to preclude it from expanding in the United States and elsewhere, and intimidate its directors,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nViva Wallet provides card acceptance through its point-of-sale (POS) application, add-on Google Play devices, and payment systems through online stores throughout Europe. It is now one of Europe\u2019s largest FinTechs.\n\nJ.P. Morgan purchased a 48.5% stake in the FinTech in late 2022 for roughly $800 million. Investment company Werealize owns the remaining stake. The Reuters report notes that the deal forbids Werealize from rejecting any J.P. Morgan offer to take control of Viva if the business\u2019s value drops below 5 billion euros by July 30 of this year.\n\nAccording to Reuters, J.P. Morgan has also this week sued Werealize, claiming the company violated shareholder agreements by causing Viva not to respect the obligation to get JPMorgan\u2019s consent before taking certain \u201cspecified significant business actions.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for J.P. Morgan told PYMNTS, \u201cWe are disappointed that since the firm\u2019s investment in 2022, WRL has repeatedly and persistently sought to undermine JPM\u2019s rights by breaching the agreement that formed the basis of the firm\u2019s investment. These actions harm not only Viva but also Greece\u2019s attractiveness for future significant investments. We now look to the courts to enforce the contract terms agreed upon between us.\u201d\n\nPYMNTS has reached out to Werealize for comment but has not yet gotten a reply.\n\nIn February of last year, Karonis sued J.P. Morgan, accusing the larger company of trying to drive down Viva\u2019s valuation. The suit also alleged that J.P. Morgan was preventing Viva from expanding into the U.S. and new European markets, and was hiring the company by allowing J.P. Morgan\u2019s payments business to compete with Viva in parts of Europe.\n\nJ.P. Morgan had also filed an earlier claim against Viva\u2019s Karonis, accusing the founder of taking measures to \u201climit or circumvent our contractual and legal rights as an investor.\u201d\n\nIn June of 2024, a judge in London issued a ruling on how Viva should be valued, with both sides expressing satisfaction with the outcome.",

The Zacks analyst believes that relatively higher interest rates, strategic acquisitions, branch openings and a decent loan balance are expected to support the company. A resurgence in deal-making activities and JPMorgan\u2019s leading position in investment banking (IB) are expected to aid related fee income.\n\nHowever, the volatile nature of capital markets and high mortgage rates will likely hurt fee income growth.\n\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)\n\nChipotle's shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (+29.0% vs. +5.6%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company is benefiting from its focus on service digitization, new menu offerings and bringing back customer favorites, and new restaurant openings, especially with drive-thru Chipotlanes. Anticipation regarding the augmented make line by Hyphen and Autocado are encouraging for the company\u2019s future sales growth.\n\nYet increased input costs, along with labor inflation, are concerns.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Chipotle Mexican Grill here >>>)\n\nShares of Workday have underperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past two years (+59.0% vs. +133.3%). Per the Zacks analyst, growing competition in the human capital and financial management software market could lead to pricing pressure and impede profits. Continuous investments to achieve long-term growth are hurting its margins in the short term. The lack of geographical diversity remains a concern.\n\nHowever, solid customer wins across various industries, including education, financials and healthcare are driving growth for the company.

At least five people have been killed in the fires and over 2,000 homes, businesses and other structures have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe report noted that nearly 30,000 acres have been impacted by the fire and nearly 15,000 houses and buildings are considered to be at risk as of Thursday \u2014 up from 13,000 as of Wednesday morning. Firefighters have struggled to contain the wildfires, which are being driven by strong Santa Ana winds.\n\n\"Expectations of economic losses stemming from the fires have more than doubled since yesterday to closer to $50 billion, and we estimate that insured losses from the event could exceed $20 billion (and even more if the fires are not controlled),\" JPMorgan analysts wrote. \"This would make this event significantly more severe than the 2018 Butte County Camp fires, the highest insured loss wildfires in California's history previously (with insured losses of roughly $10 billion).\"\n\nCALIFORNIA WILDFIRES PROMPT SCRUTINY OF FEDERAL, STATE RULES HAMPERING MITIGATION EFFORTS\n\n\"Insured losses in the Butte Camp fire were close to two-thirds of economic losses (about $15 billion). That event impacted over 150,000 acres and affected over 18,000 houses/buildings,\" the report said.\n\nThe 2018 Camp Fire devastated the town of Paradise and several nearby communities and caused 85 fatalities. It was caused by a downed utility transmission line during a high wind event.\n\nCALIFORNIA WILDFIRES: WHAT TO KNOW WHEN FILING AN INSURANCE CLAIM\n\nJPMorgan's report noted that most of the damage and insured losses in the Camp Fire came from personal property losses, which accounted for 86% of the losses compared to 12% for commercial property and 2% from all other lines and auto insurance.\n\nThe ongoing wildfires in Southern California are impacting larger population centers than the Camp Fire did, and JPMorgan analysts expect that the insured losses will be higher as a result.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"While the current wildfires haven't affected as much acreage or as many houses/buildings (thus far), more of the damage is concentrated in the affluent Pacific Palisades area, which has high value residential homes (median home price >$3 million versus <$500k in Butte County),\" the analysts wrote.\n\n\"Moreover, the fires have not been contained thus far and continue to spread, implying that estimates of potential economic and insured losses are likely to increase.\"",

            "content": "Equity analysts from investment bank JP Morgan have now doubled their earlier loss estimate for still raging Los Angeles region of California wildfires, now suggesting it could even exceed $20 billion.\n\n\n\nAt that level this would become the most expensive wildfire outbreak ever for the insurance and reinsurance market and at such a high cost there would definitely be ramifications for a number of exposed insurance-linked securities (ILS) positions.\n\nWhile the wildfires continue to rage, reports continue to suggest the number of structures destroyed or badly damaged could be as high as 2,000, although this figure could rise.\n\nWith wildfires still burning without containment and winds expected to pick up again through Thursday, the outlook for further damage in Los Angeles appears significant still.\n\nWe reported this morning that a number of analyst reports had pegged the potential insurance industry loss from the LA wildfires at somewhere between $6 billion and $13 billion.\n\nWithin that group, the JP Morgan analysts had preliminarily estimated $8 billion of insured losses from the fires.\n\nBut now, with economic loss estimates having doubled and reports suggesting damage is much more extensive, the analyst team from the bank have lifted their industry loss estimate.\n\nThe JPM analyst team explained their reasoning, \u201cExpectations of economic losses stemming from the fires have more than doubled since yesterday to closer to $50 billion, and we estimate that insured losses from the event could exceed $20 billion (and even more if the fires are not controlled).\n\n\u201cThis would make this event significantly more severe than the 2018 Butte County Camp fires, the highest insured loss wildfires in California\u2019s history previously (with insured losses of roughly $10 billion). Insured losses in the Butte Camp fire were close to two-thirds of economic losses (about $15 billion). That event impacted over 150,000 acres and affected over 18,000 houses/buildings.\n\n\u201cWhile the current wildfires haven\u2019t affected as much acreage or as many houses/buildings (thus far), more of the damage is concentrated in the affluent Pacific Palisades area, which has high value residential homes (median home price >$3 million versus <$500k in Butte County). Moreover, the fires have not been contained thus far and continue to spread, implying that estimates of potential economic and insured losses are likely to increase.\u201d\n\nWe are still a long way off any loss estimates based on actual damage information, given the still-unfolding disaster situation in Los Angeles County.\n\nSo it\u2019s hard to tell how high the total insurance market loss from these fires will rise, but it is certain to be well into the billions, it seems, based on all the estimates seen to-date.\n\nAt levels above $10 billion there would be expected to be more impacts and losses to reinsurance capital, which could include some private ILS arrangements, collateralized reinsurance and retrocession, especially for any lower-layers that feature ILS market participation.\n\nFor the catastrophe bond market, the main threat continues to be aggregate deductible erosion, it seems, which was highlighted yesterday by manager Icosa Investments.\n\nIn the cat bond market, wildfire risks are most typically featured within multi-peril deals, many of which are annual aggregate in nature.\n\nHowever, there is one dedicated California wildfire cat bond, the latest in the Randolph Re series that have been issued to support insurer Mercury\u2019s reinsurance needs.\n\nIt\u2019s a relatively small and privately placed transaction, that provides Mercury $45.5 million of collateralized reinsurance against wildfire losses in California, we understand.\n\nLarger insurers such as Liberty Mutual, Allstate, Progressive, American Family, USAA, Farmers, and Nationwide Mutual, all have in-force multi-peril cat bonds with some wildfire exposure, some of which includes coverage in California we believe.\n\nHowever, as we said and Icosa Investments highlighted, the main threat to cat bonds (aside perhaps from the Randolph Re private deal), would seem to be from aggregate deductible erosion due to this specific event.\n\nThe main threat for ILS investors would likely be from private and collateralized deals in the lower-layers of any affected reinsurance towers, we suspect.\n\nJP Morgan\u2019s analysts also said, \u201cWe expect primary insurers to incur a greater proportion of losses compared to reinsurers than for similar severity events in the past, driven by the increase in reinsurance attachment points and limited availability of aggregate covers since 2023.\u201d\n\nAlso just now, Jasper Cooper, Vice President-Senior Credit Officer, Moody\u2019s Ratings has said, \u201cThe wildfires in the Los Angeles region have caused tragic loss of life and widespread destruction of property. We would expect insured losses to run in the billions of dollars given the high value of homes and businesses in the impacted areas. Losses will be shared among standard homeowners insurers, insurers specializing in high-value E&S homeowners policies, and the California FAIR plan. In addition, commercial property losses could be significant.\u201d\n\nAs we said, it\u2019s far too early for an accurate picture of the insurance and potentially reinsurance market losses from this ongoing catastrophe event. While the JP Morgan updated estimate may prove to be on the higher-side, we won\u2019t know for certain until the fires are brought under greater control and damage assessment begins.\n\nAlso read:\n\n\u2013 LA wildfires: Analysts put insured losses in $6bn \u2013 $13bn range.

            "content": "The market expects JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 15. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +0.5%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $40.92 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.33% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",

In pushing for five days a week back in the office, the bank follows the example of the largest online retailer in the United States: Amazon.\n\nAmazon required all of its corporate employees to be back in the office every weekday as of January 2 but has since delayed its return-to-office (RTO) mandate for thousands of employees because it doesn't have enough office space.\n\nAmazon's push for RTO has inspired other companies like AT&T and Sweetgreen to follow suit and ask staff to come into the office more frequently in the new year.\n\nRelated: AT&T and Sweetgreen Are Following Amazon's Lead With Stricter Return-to-Office Mandates \u2014 Though Amazon's Plan Has Hit a Snag\n\nDespite the push for in-person work, research shows that hybrid schedules have their benefits.\n\nA study published last year in the scientific journal Nature compared a hybrid work group to an in-person work group over six months and found no observable difference in productivity, performance, or promotion between the two.\n\nHybrid work had the advantage, leading to better outcomes in terms of lower quit rates and job satisfaction.",

            "content": "The nation's largest bank is preparing to boomerang back to a pre-pandemic routine that requires employees to commute to an office all five days of the workweek.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., with more than 300,000 employees around the world, is looking to expand its in-person requirement as it and other corporate heavyweights throughout the United States become increasingly eager to get workers back to the office more regularly. The escalated mandate, reported earlier by Bloomberg, has yet to be formally announced but would effectively end the bank's flexible work policy.\n\nA JPMorgan spokesperson declined to comment to CoStar News on the company's intended policy change. However, he said that about 70% of the financial institution's employees were already back in the office on a Monday through Friday schedule, while the remaining portion of its workforce reported to a physical outpost three to four days per week.\n\narticle 7 Min Read Here's how some large employers are stepping up return-to-office mandates this year The escalated in-person requirements may not trigger a meaningful spike in leasing. Katie Burke Social\n\nIf and when enacted, the five-day requirement would close the book on a flexible work policy that has been gradually rolled back to pre-pandemic schedules, something JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has long been pushing for as an outspoken critic of remote work.\n\nIn mid-2021, the bank was among the first to begin calling some employees back on a rolling basis. By April 2022, about half of its workforce was expected to be in the office five days a week.\n\n\"As we've returned to more normal patterns in our lives and work, we can all appreciate the many benefits of in-person engagement, [and] this is especially true when it comes to the importance of being in the office,\" JPMorgan's operating committee wrote in a 2023 memo requiring all managing directors to return to the office five days a week. \"Being together in person is the best way to build and strengthen our culture \u2014 the very thing that makes our company special.\"\n\nPush to boost attendance\n\nFrom corporate giants to smaller professional services firms, employers across the country are stepping up their in-person requirements in an attempt to move past the pandemic-related shift toward increased flexible work arrangements. Office market stakeholders point to the escalated mandates, many of which take effect in 2025, as a signal that demand for office space will be on the rebound after years of depressed leasing activity.\n\nLarge employers such as Amazon, Starbucks, AT&T, Southwest Airlines and Walmart have recently stepped up their in-person requirements, and many employers are now demanding workers commute to an office all five days of the workweek.\n\nEscalated mandates have fueled optimism among national office landlords looking to retain their portfolio occupancy as tenants slashed real estate to both trim costs and adjust to flexible, post-pandemic work policies.\n\nThe combination of depressed demand, stagnant leasing and ongoing flexible work has helped push the national office vacancy rate to a record high of about 14%, according to CoStar data. Tenants have collectively handed back roughly 210 million square feet of office space since the start of 2020, with tepid demand expected to prolong any effort to revert to pre-pandemic levels of occupancy.\n\nFor JPMorgan, the push to boost in-person attendance is critical given its outsize investment in expanding its office real estate portfolio.\n\nThe New York-based bank, one of the city's largest employers, is nearing the finish line on a development set to house its new global headquarters at 270 Park Ave. in midtown Manhattan. The roughly 2.5 million-square-foot project, slated to complete construction later this year, is designed to accommodate about 14,000 employees who will have access to a slew of amenities such as outdoor lounges, a fitness center, a meditation room and an upscale food hall.\n\nJPMorgan occupies upward of 27 million square feet of office space around the world, according to CoStar data, a footprint spread across more than 700 outposts.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nJPMorgan Chase has joined a growing list of major U.S. banks to depart the United Nations-backed Net Zero Banking Alliance, a bank spokesperson confirmed to ESG Dive Tuesday.\n\nThe bank\u2019s departure, first reported by Reuters , comes a week after Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley announced their exits from NZBA and less than a month after Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo ended their memberships in the group.\n\nThe JPMorgan spokesperson said the bank would continue to work with the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which recently announced its plans to refocus its work on mobilizing capital this year.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWith JPMorgan\u2019s departure, five of the six largest U.S. commercial banks by assets have exited NZBA in the past month, according to data from the Federal Reserve.\n\nOnly three U.S.-based banks remain in NZBA \u2014 Amalgamated Bank, Climate First Bank and Areti Bank \u2014 according to the group\u2019s membership list. Amalgamated is the 158th largest U.S. bank by assets, and Climate First is the 984th, according to the Fed; Areti was not among the 2,151 banks with more than $300 million in combined assets at the end of September.\n\nThe spate of NZBA defections comes just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office with a Republican majority in both the House and Senate. The membership withdrawals also come after House Republicans spent the past two years probing such climate alliances for potential antitrust and consumer protection law violations.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work independently to advance the interests of our Firm, our shareholders and our clients and remain focused on pragmatic solutions to help further low-carbon technologies while advancing energy security,\u201d a JPMorgan spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe will also continue to support the banking and investment needs of our clients who are engaged in energy transition and in decarbonizing different sectors of the economy.\u201d\n\nAll of the recently defecting NZBA members were targeted by state Republican-led probes in the past few years. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo were all probed by 14 Republican state attorneys general about their membership in 2022 and 12 Republican heads of agriculture last year about their membership status in the group.\n\nDespite leaving NZBA, JPMorgan is now at least the third recently departed bank to say it will also maintain engagement with GFANZ, which is the UN-backed umbrella organization for NZBA and other climate-focused alliances in the financial sector. Citi and Bank of America also reiterated their commitment to GFANZ in statements to ESG Dive last week.\n\nThe JPMorgan spokesperson said the bank will continue working with GFANZ, \u201camong others,\u201d on advancing solutions and the market conditions that \u201ccan help further a low-carbon and energy-secure future.\u201d\n\nThe continued commitment to working with GFANZ follows a Jan. 2 announcement from the group\u2019s secretariat Mary Schapiro that the alliance will restructure and turn its attention to \u201cmobilizing [climate] finance through public-private partnerships.\u201d\n\nSchapiro said the group had \u201cachieved its initial goal of developing the building blocks\u201d of a financial system able to finance the net-zero transition, and will now look to close the financing gap.\n\nUnder the restructuring, the alliance will engage through an independent \u201cPrincipals Group,\u201d led by CEOs and financial institution leaders, according to Schapiro\u2019s letter. The Principals Group includes Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser and BofA CEO Brian Moynihan, as well as BlackRock CEO and Chair Larry Fink and State Street CEO and Chair Ron O\u2019Hanley, among others.",

Following the departure of JPMorgan, the only remaining U.S. banks listed on the NZBA website are Amalgamated Bank, Areti Bank, and Climate First Bank.\n\nIn a statement provided to ESG Today, a JPMorganChase spokesperson said:\n\n\u201cJPMC is ending our membership in the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). We will continue to work independently to advance the interests of our Firm, our shareholders and our clients and remain focused on pragmatic solutions to help further low-carbon technologies while advancing energy security. We will also continue to support the banking and investment needs of our clients who are engaged in energy transition and in decarbonizing different sectors of the economy.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan joined the NZBA in October 2021, shortly after the launch of the alliance. Members of the NZBA commit to transitioning operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their financing activities to align with net zero pathways by 2050, and to set 2030 financed emissions targets, initially focused on key emissions intensive sectors.\n\nAfter rapidly expanding from 43 banks at launch to over 140 banks representing $74 trillion in 2024, members of the group have come under significant pressure, particularly from Republican politicians in the U.S., who have been warning financial institutions including banks, insurers, asset owners and investors of potential legal violations from their participation in climate-focused alliances and of plans to exclude the companies from state business, as part of a broader anti-ESG political campaign.\n\nThe NZBA formed part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a UN-backed umbrella group of net zero-focused financial sector coalitions, including the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM), Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA), Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance (NZFSPA), the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative (NZICI), the Paris Aligned Asset Owners (PAAO), the Venture Climate Alliance (VCA), and the Net-Zero Export Credit Agencies Alliance (NZECA).\n\nGFANZ announced a major restructuring and repositioning earlier this month, including a shift in focus towards enabling the mass mobilization of capital to support the low carbon transition, and opening participation widely even to firms not participating in the net zero coalitions.\n\nJPMorgan announced a commitment in October 2020 to align its financing activities with the goals of Paris Agreement, and to help clients navigate the challenges and capitalize on the long-term economic and environmental benefits of transitioning to a low-carbon world. Since joining the NZBA, the firm has set interim, net zero-aligned financed emissions reduction targets for eight sectors, including Oil & Gas, Electric Power, Auto Manufacturing, Aviation, Shipping, Iron & Steel, Cement and Aluminum. The targets remain in place on the company\u2019s website.\n\nThe bank\u2019s statement added that the firm plans to continue engaging with GFANZ and other groups, \u201cto advance pragmatic solutions and market conditions that can help further a low-carbon and energy-secure future.\u201d",

This week\u2019s list includes Wells Fargo WFC and JPMorgan JPM.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Looms: A Preview\n\nThe first earnings season of the New Year will get underway on January 10th, with the big banks reporting results for the last quarter of 2024.\n\nThe expectation is that 2024 Q4 earnings for the S&P 500 index will be up +7.6% on +4.7% higher revenues. This would follow the +8.3% earnings growth in Q3 on +5.5% higher revenues.\n\nAs we have noted here all along, the revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q4 earnings season has been fairly stable.\n\nAt the sector level, estimates have been cut for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors since the quarter got underway, with the biggest declines at the Aerospace, Industrial Products, Energy, Conglomerates, and Basic Materials sectors. On the positive side, estimates have increased since the quarter underway for 5 of the 16 Zacks sectors. These sectors are Finance, Consumer Discretionary, Technology, Business Services, and Autos.\n\nThe positive revisions trend for the Finance sector can be seen in how estimates for some of the major banks have unfolded. For example, Wells Fargo will kick off the reporting cycle for the sector on January 10th, and JPMorgan will report on January 15th.\n\nWells Fargo is expected to bring in $1.33 per share in Q4 EPS, up +3.1% from the year-earlier period on essentially flat revenues at $20.5 billion. Wells Fargo's $1.33 per share earnings estimate for the period has inched up from $1.31 per share two months back and $1.27 per share three months back.\n\nJPMorgan is expected to earn $3.86 per share in Q4, down -2.8% from the year-earlier period, on +5% higher revenues at $40.5 billion. Analysts have raised their estimates for JPMorgan steadily, with the current $3.86 per share estimate up +1.3% over the past month and up +2.7% over the past three months.\n\nJPMorgan and Wells Fargo shares are off their late-November 2024 highs but have still been solid performers over the preceding year, handily outperforming the S&P 500 index as well as the Zacks Finance sector.\n\nFor the Finance sector as a whole, 2024 Q4 earnings are expected to be up +12.1% from the same period last year on +5% higher revenues. This would follow the sector's +5.9% earnings and revenue growth in 2024 Q3.\n\nThe Finance sector is one of only three Zacks sectors that are expected to enjoy double-digit earnings growth in Q4; Technology (earnings growth of +14.9%) and Medical (+15.3%) are the other two.",

These tools go beyond simple automation, acting as catalysts for innovation, efficiency and growth. For founders, harnessing AI could be crucial to remain competitive in an increasingly digital and data-driven world.\n\nAI for startups\n\nThe adoption of AI and LLM tools is growing across diverse applications, offering startups solutions that could streamline operations and boost productivity. Advanced language models provide natural language processing capabilities, useful for automating customer support, generating sales and marketing content and drafting proposals. Machine learning platforms could allow startups to create custom models for predictive analytics, aiding sales forecasting and inventory management. Additionally, AI-driven analytics can process large datasets to potentially uncover insights and trends, supporting strategic decisions. Identifying the right combination of tools for your business could be critical.\n\nThe transformative potential of AI and LLMs\n\nAI offers a wide array of capabilities, from learning and reasoning to problem-solving. LLMs, a subset of AI, excel in processing and generating humanlike text, potentially making them invaluable for content creation and customer interaction. Integrating these technologies into startup operations could streamline processes, enhance decision-making and shorten development cycles.\n\nStartups often have limited resources compared to established businesses. Automating routine tasks with AI could allow employees to focus on higher-value activities. For instance, AI-driven chatbots could potentially manage initial customer requests, which might in turn reduce the workload on customer service teams and enable them to address more complex issues while improving response times.\n\nAdditionally, AI\u2019s scalability could allow startups to expand operations without the traditional human resource constraints. For example, an e-commerce startup could use AI to manage inventory, process orders and handle customer inquiries simultaneously, potentially facilitating growth without a proportional increase in staff.",

            "content": "Despite the cautious optimism a year ago, 2024 did not exactly bust the biopharma industry out of the prolonged downturn that followed the pandemic boom. Going into the 2025 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, leaders in the space are a bit more pessimistic.\n\n\u201cSentiment is really bad in general in biotech,\u201d Seaport Therapeutics CEO Daphne Zohar told BioSpace.\n\nThat said, Zohar and others are looking forward to potentially big news that could spark that optimistic attitude once again. The annual gathering in San Francisco is a who\u2019s who of biopharma with thousands of executives descending on the Bay Area looking to strike deals. The meeting, which officially begins next Monday, Jan. 13, sets the tone for the year, and for many executives who spoke to BioSpace, a few high-profile transactions could really change the tune. But, Zohar commented, it needs to happen early.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t see a lot of M&A between now and, like, the Tuesday of J.P. Morgan, I think we\u2019ll have kind of negative sentiment,\u201d Zohar said in a late December interview. \u201cI always feel like, by Monday, if you\u2019re not seeing a lot, then people begin to assume that there\u2019s not much that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nLinda Marb\u00e1n, CEO of cell and exosome-based therapy biotech Capricor Therapeutics, agreed that the industry will be watching closely. And despite the swirling gloom, some of last year\u2019s \u201ccautious optimism\u201d still exists, she wrote in an email to BioSpace.\n\n\u201cWhile challenges like clinical failures remind us of the complexity of developing transformative therapies, they also reinforce the importance of innovation and persistence,\u201d she said. \u201cI think everyone is eager to see what opportunities JPM will bring.\u201d\n\n2024: A Lull in Big Deals\n\n2024 ended with multiple high-profile clinical failures: Roche\u2019s Prothena-partnered Parkinson\u2019s drug ; Novartis\u2019 similar flop for a UCB asset ; Galectin\u2019s stock-crushing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) miss; Axsome\u2019s mixed Alzheimer\u2019s disease agitation results and many more. 2025 didn\u2019t start off much better, with Neumora Therapeutics reporting the Phase III failure of a much-anticipated major depressive disorder candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, companies have been slashing pipelines and headcounts . Even good news has not been reflecting at the stock market, according to Zohar.\n\n2023 ended with a flurry of deals that defined 2024, including one involving Karuna Therapeutics\u2014a biotech formed from Zohar\u2019s former company, PureTech Health. Bristol Myers Squibb swooped in to pick up the neuroscience biotech for $14 billion in the final weeks of that year, then brought the company\u2019s schizophrenia asset to an FDA approval in September 2024 . Peer AbbVie had the opposite luck with a similarly timed buyout of Cerevel Therapeutics. The biotech\u2019s lead asset failed in two Phase II schizophrenia trials in November 2024. AbbVie is hoping to have better luck with other assets from the transaction.\n\n2024, meanwhile, didn\u2019t have a ton of sector-defining deals. Companies kept their buys to under $5 billion with just one exception: Novo Holdings\u2019 $16.5 billion acquisition of contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) Catalent.\n\nWhat 2025 holds for the sector remains to be seen, with all eyes on JPM for potentially the first multi-billion dollar announcement of the year. But while a big acquisition would certainly help jumpstart the industry, some positive regulatory news, clinical data or other \u201cmeaningful partnerships\u201d could also help sentiment, Marb\u00e1n said.\n\nExecutive Wish Lists\n\nExecutives from Galimedix Therapeutics have a lofty set of goals heading into the meeting. Executive Chairman and co-founder Alexander Gebauer told BioSpace that his team will meet with several investment banks and venture capital firms in preparation for raising a crossover round this year. The company, which focuses on small molecule drugs for serious eye and brain diseases, is planning a U.S. initial public offering in 2026.\n\nThe IPO window did not open as expected in 2024, so Galimedix\u2019s crew will have their work cut out for them. But Gebauer is confident.\n\n\u201cThe investors have become even more selective,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cI believe that quality will prevail; companies with excellent teams and high-quality programs should be able to get the support they require.\u201d\n\nZevra Therapeutics\u2019 management will head into JPM with both partnering and acquisitions on their minds as well as investor relations meetings. CEO Neil McFarlane told BiosSpace that his company has executed several buyouts in the past so he\u2019s looking to meet with companies that may have single assets in need of a larger partner with proven infrastructure. At the same time, Zevra is also seeking partners for its idiopathic hypersomnia program.\n\nThijs Spoor, CEO of radiopharma biotech Perspective Therapeutics, similarly has a big wish list heading into the meeting. \u201cI usually go into J.P. Morgan with three buckets of requests: One is people that want money from us\u2014and I\u2019m not doing really any of those for this go around\u2014and then there\u2019s people that I want money from, and then there\u2019s people that I want to do a deal with.\u201d\n\nPerspective is in the enviable position of not needing to court investors at this year\u2019s meeting, having raised a cash reserve of $250 million in 2024. Instead, Spoor and his team will focus on getting his company\u2019s name out there and updating its story from the year prior.\n\nSeaport, which just emerged in April of last year, will present at the conference in the private company track, according to Zohar. The executive team will be meeting with investors and pharma companies, as well as taking some time to see old friends and colleagues.\n\nAnother big headwind over the industry is the presidential transition. Donald Trump will re-take the presidency on January 20, just after the JPM meeting concludes. Zohar and Gebauer both said that the wait for the new administration has suppressed deal activity.\n\n\u201cThe sooner stability can be achieved, the more openness [we\u2019ll see] to invest,\u201d Gebauer said.\n\nImmunic Therapeutics Chief Operating Officer Jason Tardio said the macroeconomic stars are aligning for a year full of deal activity: the cost of capital has come down and interest rates are declining. On the policy front, the incoming Trump administration and Republican-led Congress are expected to ease corporate taxes, regulatory hurdles and drug pricing provisions like the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\u201c2025 could see significant megadeals as companies look to fill their growth gaps ahead of the looming loss of exclusivity in 2028,\u201d Tardio said.\n\nWhether the deals come now or later, Zohar is similarly confident that deal activity will return, fueled by Big Pharma. \u201cThey really need to fill their pipeline, so at some point they\u2019re going to get pretty aggressive.\u201d\n\n",

JPMorgan analysts have projected that the company might see a 40% decline in profits due to anticipated policy changes under President-elect Donald Trump JPMorgan analysts estimate that the elimination of electric vehicle (EV) tax credits and subsidies could reduce Tesla's profits by up to 40%, equating to a potential loss of approximately $3.2 billion. These subsidies have been crucial in making EVs more affordable and stimulating consumer demand. Eliminating them may lead to higher vehicle prices, potentially reducing sales and profits.In addition to policy changes, Tesla is facing increased competition in the EV market. Ford and General Motors (GM) have reported stronger growth in EV sales compared to Tesla, highlighting the intensified competition. Ford sold 30,176 all-electric vehicles in Q4, with an annual growth of 35% for their EV sales, leading to a positive market response and a 2.3% increase in stock price. GM sold about 44,000 EVs in Q4, showing a significant year-over-year increase of 126% and resulting in a 0.8% rise in stock price.Analysts are divided on Tesla's future. Some maintain an optimistic outlook, citing potential regulatory support under the new administration. However, others express concerns about the company's ability to maintain its market share and profitability amidst policy changes and increased competition.While Tesla has been a leader in the EV market, upcoming policy shifts and rising competition present significant challenges.Companies like Ford and General Motors are gaining ground in the electric vehicle market. Their growing EV sales put more pressure on Tesla, which may see a drop in market share.Analysts are divided. Some are optimistic about regulatory support, but others worry that the combination of reduced subsidies and rising competition could hurt Tesla's profitability.",

Indeed, the institution has expressed some concern regarding what could be on the horizon when US President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year.\n\nThe Elon Musk-led company skyrocketed after Trump emerged victorious in the 2024 election. Just one month prior, the company unveiled its highly anticipated Robotaxi product line. With autonomous vehicles set to be a critical part of its business model, there is a lot that is on the line as it enters a critical 2025.\n\nSource: Vanity Fair\n\nAlso Read: Tesla (TSLA) Up 69% Since Trump Win: Is Now the Time to Buy?\n\nJPMorgan Warns 40% of Tesla Profits in Trouble in 2025\n\nThroughout the last several months of 2024, Elon Musk joined Donald Trump on the 2024 campaign trail. In response, the Tesla CEO was made head of Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency Commission (DOGE), in a move that many thought would be a good one for Musk\u2019s various entrepreneurial endeavors.\n\nHowever, that may prove to not be the case. Indeed, Tesla stock may be in trouble, as JPMorgan has predicted profits will evaporate in 2025. Specifically, the bank has stated that the EV manufacturer will lose around 40% under the incoming Trump administration, according to a Business Insider report.\n\nSource: The Financial Technology Expert\n\nAlso Read: Tesla (TSLA) Cybertruck Qualifies for up to $7,500 in US Tax Credit\n\nThe projection comes amid Trump\u2019s seeking to remove EV tax credits that help incentivize the purchase of Tesla Moreover, the increased risks take place as Tesla has already gotten off to a shaky start to the year. The company reported a drop in annual vehicle sales for the first time in a decade.\n\n\u201cTesla does not appear to us on track to dominate the global auto industry amidst the electrification transition, which we view as only the starting point for present valuation,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman notes.\n\nFor Musk, the Robotaxi is still the focus for Tesla.

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Risky companies defaulted more than once at a record rate in 2024, according to a new report from JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nAround 35% of the year\u2019s defaults and distressed exchanges were repeat offenders in a historical record, the report from strategists led by Nelson Jantzen said. That\u2019s while the leveraged loan default rate is at a roughly four-year high.\n\nInterest rates remaining higher for a big part of last year weakened balance sheets of lower-rated companies. That impact has been especially pronounced in the leveraged loan market as those issuers borrow on a floating-rate basis, with interest costs nearly doubling for some when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. While the central bank cut rates three times last year, it signaled that it would slow its pace in 2025.\n\nThe loan market also has a greater share of lower-rated issuers than the high-yield market as private equity firms increasingly tapped the asset class during the period of near-zero rates. That\u2019s meant that the default rate in the loan market has far outpaced that of the high-yield bond market, with the gulf between the two at a 24-year high, the report said.\n\nThe par-weighted US high-yield bond default rate stood at 1.47% while the same metric for loans was 4.49% at the end of the year.\n\nLoan issuers with high debt loads have increasingly undertaken so-called liability management exercises to reshape capital structures, often while facing a looming maturity or cash crunch. A record 70% of the 2024\u2019s default and exchange volume was attributed to a distressed exchange, according to the report.\n\nStill, such transactions don\u2019t always slash enough debt to turn companies around, and borrowers could end up defaulting again, leading to still lower recoveries for investors.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Within the span of a month, Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks have quit what had been one of the most popular clubs inside global finance.\n\nThe Net-Zero Banking Alliance \u2014 a group dedicated to helping lenders reduce their carbon footprints \u2014 has in quick succession been abandoned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest US bank, looks to be next in line.\n\nThe moves reflect US banks\u2019 desire to shield themselves from increasing political pressure as Donald Trump returns to the White House, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. And NZBA is bracing for more US exits, Secretariat Lead Sarah Kemmitt told members in a Dec. 31 letter seen by Bloomberg. She cited the \u201cpolitical environment.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the real-world impact of the NZBA defections is unclear. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, banks have collectively stepped up their financing of the fossil-fuel industry since the alliance was formed in 2021.\n\nMembership of NZBA was likely more a case of \u201cvirtue signaling\u201d than \u201cmeaningful climate impacts,\u201d said Jill Fisch, a business law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nA spokesperson for NZBA declined to comment.\n\nActivists are now demanding that the government intervene to target Wall Street. Environmental Advocates NY, a nonprofit, says it\u2019s urging New York state officials to introduce regulations and laws that would compel banks operating in the world\u2019s biggest financial hub to take climate action.\n\nThe wave of NZBA exits follows behind-the-scenes tensions that have been brewing for more than two years, Bloomberg\u2019s reporting has shown. In 2022, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were among banks pushing back against binding targets on climate finance. NZBA then watered down some requirements, and members stayed put. But as the Republican Party grows more hostile toward climate-friendly organizations, the finance industry is repositioning itself.\n\nGlobal temperatures are rising fast, yet banks continue to reap short-term profits by sticking with fossil fuel producers. It\u2019s therefore both \u201cdistressing and unsurprising\u201d that Wall Street is turning it\u2019s back on net zero alliances, said Ken Pucker, who teaches sustainability at the Fletcher School at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts.\n\nThe alliances were created in order to encourage the finance industry to take into account the longer-term cost of supporting oil, gas and coal.\n\nBack in 2021, when NZBA was formed, banks now leaving the alliance proudly touted their membership. BofA Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan spoke of a \u201ccommitment to net zero\u201d in his role as co-chair of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, whose stated mission is to \u201cbuild a coordinated global effort\u201d to help green the private sector.\n\nAnd in an April 2021 statement announcing its agenda, the world\u2019s biggest coalition for climate finance \u2014 the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero \u2014 said it would \u201crequire signatories to set science-aligned interim and long-term goals to reach net zero no later than 2050.\u201d\n\nGFANZ ended 2024 by recalibrating its mission as banks flee and GOP attacks intensify. The group is distancing itself from the net zero alliances for which it had previously been an umbrella organization. Going forward, GFANZ will make its guidance available to financial firms, whether they\u2019ve committed to a net zero alliance or not.\n\nA spokesperson for GFANZ declined to comment beyond the group\u2019s public statements. Banks that sign up to NZBA still commit to transition their financed emissions to align with \u201cpathways to net zero by 2050\u201d at the latest, according to its website. They\u2019re also required to provide 2030 targets to show they\u2019re on track, and to document their progress.\n\nAll banks exiting NZBA have made public statements to say they still recognize decarbonization as a worthy goal. But they\u2019ve also made clear that their biggest duty is to serve the needs of their clients. None has provided an official reason for quitting the alliance.\n\nWall Street is now navigating a world in which bankers and money managers suspected of being unsupportive of the GOP\u2019s pro-fossil fuel agenda face a growing threat of litigation.\n\nJust weeks after Trump was re-elected in November, Texas led a move to sue BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by adopting pro-climate strategies to suppress coal production.\n\nThen in December, the GOP-led House Judiciary Committee said it found \u201csubstantial evidence that a climate cartel of financial institutions\u201d had engaged in \u201canticompetitive collusion\u201d by demanding that companies \u201cdisclose, reduce and enforce\u201d their net zero climate commitments.\n\nThe committee, which is led by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, singled out GFANZ and similar groups for leading what it described as a climate crusade.\n\nGOP members have made clear they feel increasingly emboldened. After hearing of the defections from NZBA, Republican Congressman-elect Riley Moore of West Virginia said via a spokesperson that he will keep trying to ban and block financial firms suspected of supporting \u201canti-fossil fuel ESG policies.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street firms continue to earn considerably more from arranging fossil-fuel deals than their European counterparts. Last year, JPMorgan topped the league table of banks underwriting bonds and loans for oil, gas and coal companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was followed by Wells Fargo, TD Securities, BofA, RBC Capital Markets and Citigroup. The biggest underwriter of green bonds, meanwhile, was BNP Paribas SA, which is the largest bank in the European Union.\n\nEuropean banks, which are subject to much stricter climate regulations than their US peers, have so far showed no sign of walking away from NZBA. And representatives of lenders with headquarters spanning London to Amsterdam to Frankfurt said they plan to stay put.\n\n\u201cOur position is very straightforward, we have absolutely no intention of leaving the NZBA,\u201d a spokesperson for Standard Chartered Plc told Bloomberg. ING Groep NV and Deutsche Bank AG have made similar statements.\n\nGlobal banks provided about $680 billion worth of fossil-fuel loans and bond deals in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s up from $667 billion in 2021, when NZBA was created. Banks that have stepped up such deals over the period include BofA and Goldman, the data show.\n\nPucker of Tufts University draws parallels between the choices banks are making today, and those they made in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis. He says to understand banks\u2019 thinking now, it\u2019s worth recalling a 2007 comment by Charles O. Prince III, who was Citigroup\u2019s CEO at the time: \u201c\u2018As long as the music is playing, you\u2019ve got to get up and dance\u2019.\u201d\n\nGlobal warming is now on track to race past the critical threshold of 1.5C, raising questions as to the value of having financial firms claim they can still align their operations with that target.\n\n\u201cBanks merely reflect the real economy,\u201d said Aniket Shah, head of sustainability and transition strategy at Jefferies Financial Group Inc. \u201cSo if the real economy remains a hydrocarbon economy, then banks will reflect that too.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental Advocates NY says the state government must now consider forcing banks to impose financing limits to align with climate goals, including restrictions targeting fossil fuels. They also are calling for rules that would require banks to document the extent to which they\u2019re lowering their so-called financed emissions.\n\nVanessa Fajans-Turner, executive director at the nonprofit, said it\u2019s clear Republicans have succeeded in their efforts to get Wall Street to retreat from climate commitments, \u201cmodest\u201d as they were.\n\n\u201cThe banks won\u2019t police themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need regulation.\u201d\n\n(GFANZ is co-chaired by Mark Carney, who is chair of Bloomberg Inc. and a former Bank of England governor, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.)\n\n--With assistance from Alastair Marsh, Gautam Naik and Todd Gillespie.\n\n(Updates with comment from Jefferies in fourth-last paragraph.)\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

The results rounded out a year when Tesla finally started to feel the pinch of a larger slowdown in the EV market as consumers gravitated toward more affordable and practical hybrids.\n\nThe results also slightly reversed a stunning postelection rally for Tesla's stock price, as investors were encouraged by Musk's proximity to the White House and his new extragovernmental commission's work to relax autonomous-vehicle regulations that restrict Tesla's big robotaxi plans.\n\nBrinkman argued that Thursday's sales results should be investors' wake-up call.\n\n\"The slowing of deliveries, even ahead of a likely subsidy removal, we think has the potential to refocus investors on the deterioration in deliveries, revenue, gross profit, EBIT, EPS, and FCF estimates across all periods,\" Brinkman wrote, reiterating a bearish $135 price target for the stock.\n\nMusk has insisted that removing EV subsidies would benefit Tesla, but Brinkman disagreed. He estimated that Tesla has the most to lose from shifting regulations under Trump, costing it about $3.2 billion, as government subsidies account for a reliable minority of Tesla's revenue.\n\nTesla's regulatory-credits business has for years provided a reliable cash flow. Essentially, Tesla makes money on the EVs its competitors don't sell when these companies purchase Tesla's extra regulatory credits. Additionally, Tesla's most affordable vehicle, the Model 3, benefits from the $7,500 tax credit applied to some new EV purchases under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nTesla shares rebounded slightly on Friday morning, up by about 4%.",

            "content": "Tesla (TSLA) faces a challenging road ahead as the second Trump administration takes the helm, despite the close relationship between CEO Elon Musk and the incoming president. JPMorgan (JPM) has warned that Tesla could see significant financial strain due to proposed policy changes, particularly the removal of EV tax credits and subsidies that have made Tesla vehicles more accessible to consumers. According to BI, analysts from the bank estimate that these changes could threaten about 40% of Tesla\u2019s profit margin.\n\nThe company\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter of 2024 was disappointing, with Tesla reporting a slight decline in annual vehicle sales to 1.79 million cars from the previous year\u2019s record of 1.8 million. This marked the first annual decrease since Tesla became a prominent player in the automotive market, signaling a slowdown in demand for electric vehicles (EVs) as the market shifts towards more cost-effective hybrid options.\n\nThis sales drop came after a 63% surge in Tesla\u2019s stock price post-election, fueled by optimism about Musk\u2019s political connections and the potential for regulatory relief concerning autonomous vehicles. However, the reality of decreased sales figures has prompted a reassessment among analysts. Ryan Brinkman, a JPMorgan analyst, issued a note to clients on Friday morning, warning that the current downturn \u2014 even before the expected removal of subsidies \u2014 should serve as a critical wake-up call for investors. He highlighted the risk of further declines in key financial metrics such as deliveries, revenue, and profit, reaffirming, as per BI\u2019s report, his bearish $135 price target for Tesla stock.\n\nMusk has argued that removing EV subsidies would ultimately benefit Tesla, suggesting that it would level the playing field with competitors. However, Brinkman counters this, estimating a significant financial hit of about $3.2 billion for Tesla due to the loss of these subsidies, which have been a stable revenue stream through Tesla\u2019s regulatory-credits business. This business model allows Tesla to profit from the regulatory credits it sells to other manufacturers who fail to meet emissions standards, bolstering Tesla\u2019s bottom line.\n\nDespite these concerns, Tesla\u2019s stock showed resilience, rebounding with an 8.22% increase by the end of the trading day on Friday, closing at $410.44. This rebound suggests that while the immediate outlook might be fraught with challenges, investor confidence in Tesla\u2019s long-term potential remains, possibly buoyed by Musk\u2019s influence and the ongoing promise of innovations like the robotaxi.\n\nThe situation underscores the delicate balance Tesla must navigate between political landscapes, market dynamics, and its strategic positioning in the evolving automotive industry. As the EV market matures and competition intensifies, Tesla\u2019s success will increasingly depend on its ability to adapt to regulatory changes, manage costs, and maintain its edge in technology and consumer appeal.",

And while planning for retirement involves a lot of sitting tight for the long haul, there are still current events with the potential to impact portfolios that investors should be aware of.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Wealth Management recently hosted a webcast which examined retirement planning for investors just starting to plan, those nearing retirement and everyone in between. Brian Blagdon, Head of Investment Specialists at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, spoke with Elyse Ausenbaugh, Head of Investment Strategy at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, and Michael Conrath, Chief Retirement Strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The trio spoke on how to successfully create a retirement plan along with specific factors one ought to consider heading into 2025.\n\nHere are some highlights.\n\nWhere do things stand now with the economy and markets?\n\nThe trio of specialists covered a range of retirement planning topics throughout the webcast, opting to first tackle a question that\u2019s been top of mind for investors all year: How has the market fared throughout 2024?\n\n\u201cWhen you look at market performance, 2024 has been a phenomenally strong year,\u201d Ausenbaugh said.\n\nRunning the numbers, there\u2019s been an approximately 20% rally in equities so far year-to-date. Magnificent Seven companies led the way for the first half of 2024, bolstered by excitement over artificial intelligence. In the second half of the year, the rally has broadened out with sectors like utilities, real estate, financials and industrials outperforming.\n\nOf course, another big development has been the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to cut interest rates. This demonstrates not only that inflation has cooled down significantly, but also that the Fed is prepared to stave off labor market and broad economic weakness if needed.\n\n\u201cAll in all, when we pull the pieces together, it appears that the ingredients for the so-called soft landing, no-recession scenario where the Fed is cutting interest rates are here. And investors are embracing that despite uncertainties [\u2026] and everything we've been through since the start of 2020,\u201d Ausenbaugh said.\n\nGetting started with a retirement plan\n\nWhat do these things mean for someone just getting started on their retirement planning journey \u2013 and where exactly do you start?\n\n\u201cThe typical person spends more time planning a vacation than they do planning for retirement,\u201d Conrath said. \u201cPretty wild, right? I have been guilty myself. We live in an instant gratification society; there are benefits of thinking about vacation versus other things like planning, retirement and markets.\n\n\u201cBut the thing is,\u201d he continued, \u201c[retirement planning] actually can be approachable. It doesn't have to feel so daunting. A great place to start is with something like a wealth plan.\u201d\n\nJ.P. Morgan offers wealth planning as a service, which helps you balance retirement with other goals you have for yourself and your family. It looks at where you\u2019re at today and the actionable steps you need to take to reach your goals. Essentially, it\u2019s creating a long-term roadmap for your wealth and retirement while keeping in mind current market conditions.\n\nThe three levels of control\n\n\u201c[Control is] one of those key components around retirement that is so unique,\u201d Blagdon said. \u201cIn many cases, things that we think we have complete control over we may not. Or things out of our control \u2013 maybe we have more than we actually think.\u201d\n\nTo this point, Conrath explained that there are three levels of control when it comes to retirement planning:\n\nThings out of your control\n\nThings you have limited control over\n\nThings you have complete control over\n\nHe gave examples for each.\n\n\u201c[We] don't have the control of the outcomes of markets,\u201d Conrath said. Despite this, investors still plan and manage portfolios around market fluctuations.\n\nMeanwhile, we have some control around things like how long we live and how long we need to work for; and we have complete control over our investing and spending behaviors.\n\nSaving vs. investing\n\nLooking at what investors can control, one important decision is whether to save or invest.\n\nWhile saving is having the discipline to put money away, investing is more nuanced. Conrath described it as \u201cearmarking dollars for a specific goal in the future and ideally targeting a rate of return that will increase your likelihood of reaching that goal.\u201d\n\nSaving is a good habit to have but in the context of retirement, saving without investing probably won\u2019t cut it. To reach a fully funded retirement that can support you for decades, most will need to focus on investing.\n\nCreating a long-term strategy\n\nWhen you\u2019re looking at investing for retirement, a key component of that plan will be your time horizon. This is not only how long you have before you retire, but how long you\u2019ll need your retirement funds to last.\n\n\u201cOne of the pitfalls I see clients make is they plan around averages. They may plan for average markets and plan for average life expectancy,\u201d Conrath said. \u201cThat might be a helpful starting point. But for at least half of the folks, it could undershoot your goal.\u201d\n\nConrath and advisors and strategists at J.P. Morgan like to take a more individualized approach, which considers a variety of factors including health, gender and marital status.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a married couple aged 65 today, \u201cyou have a 43% chance that one of you will live to age 90 or beyond,\u201d he said. \u201c[For nonsmokers], there's a 73% chance that one member of that married couple will live to at least age 90.\u201d\n\nThese numbers go up as we move into the future and life expectancies increase.\n\n\u201cThe takeaway when you're doing planning [is] you need to stress-test different scenarios here and think about what happens if I live 30, 35-plus years without a paycheck,\u201d Conrath said. \u201cAm I taking all the right steps to make sure that my money lasts as long as I do?\u201d\n\nHow might the election impact retirement plans?\n\nAnother topic that can worry investors is election outcome \u2013 particularly with big elections like a presidential race. But our experts say it\u2019s important to stay consistent with investing and retirement planning regardless of who is in office.\n\n\u201cOver the long run, election outcomes don't tend to have a meaningful impact on either the trajectory of the economy or the performance of markets,\u201d Ausenbaugh said. \u201cRegardless of who has controlled the White House over the years, our economy has continued to grow and expand even taking in to account the historical recessions we've been through along the way.\u201d\n\nThat said, there are important policy considerations when it comes to the current election, especially as it relates to taxes and government debt \u2013 things that investors will need to monitor as we move forward with a new administration.\n\nTaxes and retirement planning\n\nOne of the big questions marks here is, of course, the sunset of rates that came with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and whether those rates may be extended.\n\nIn respect to tax planning, Conrath encouraged investors to consider the different vehicles they\u2019re invested in. \u201cDo [you] have too many retirement eggs in one of these baskets?\u201d he asked.\n\nFor example, many have the lion\u2019s share of their investments in a 401(k), traditional IRA or both. Some questions you may want to ask yourself include: Am I taking full advantage of my employer match? Am I maxing out my contributions? And, importantly, am I considering my tax burden in retirement, and do I want to diversify with something like a Roth?\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we don't know where tax rates are headed. We don't know what future policy holds for all of us. But what we do know is there could be opportunities now to diversify across these vehicles, because as it relates to your retirement spending, the most important thing is not just what you earn but what you get to keep,\u201d Conrath said.\n\nWhere to focus your attention in the markets\n\nLooking forward, \u201cinvestors should feel really confident about putting money to work in the market today but also staying invested for the long run in order to enjoy the benefits of allowing those returns to compound over time,\u201d Ausenbaugh noted.\n\nAs far as which vehicles one should invest in, she pointed to two major themes she thinks will continue to define markets: national security and artificial intelligence.\n\nNational security focuses on elements like traditional defense, supply chains, cybersecurity and energy infrastructure. Some of this also carries over to artificial intelligence, particularly with cybersecurity and energy infrastructure.\n\n\u201cMy favorite statistic right now in terms of contextualizing this is to consider that today\u2019s data centers account for about 4.5% of the consumption of U.S. energy supply,\u201d Ausenbaugh said. \u201cBy 2030, there are some estimates as high as 21.5% in terms of what that consumption of energy supply is expected to be from these data centers as artificial intelligence proliferates.\u201d\n\nAusenbaugh advised building exposure across sectors and regions when investing in these themes.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAccording to Conrath, successful retirement planning can be summed up in one word: alignment. That means aligning your portfolio with your goals. It also means aligning all aspects of your retirement plan, including your income sources, investments, projected expenses and estate or legacy plan.\n\n\u201cSomething like a wealth plan can help you think of all of these things interchangeably and cohesively together in one package,\u201d Conrath concluded.

The CFPB hit JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Early Warning Services with a lawsuit over Zelle, contending the banks didn\u2019t go far enough to protect consumers in creating the peer-to-peer payments platform, then abandoned fraud victims.\n\nStill, \u201call of the rules matter for different reasons,\u201d Lake said last month, before the lawsuit\u2019s filing. \u201cAnd for some of them, there are constituents on the other side of our arguments. And so, it is not obvious that everything is going to go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're going to prepare for the fact that some of those things could land,\u201d Lake said, without elaborating on what those are, adding that the company will be patient.\n\nConsumer growth\n\nJPMorgan expects to spend about $95 billion this year as it pursues growth opportunities, Lake said. In the consumer unit, that includes chasing new credit card and bank account customers, and opening new branches.\n\nThe bank has grown consumer bank accounts by close to 30% and card accounts by nearly 40% over the past five years, Lake said. In February 2024, the bank \u2013 which has nearly 5,000 branches across the country \u2013 said it planned to open 500 more by 2027.\n\nThe branch strategy is \u201ca very long game,\u201d Lake said, \u201cbut we understand what we're doing and it is paying dividends.\u201d Branches opened in the past five years are fueling the bank\u2019s market share gains, and Lake expects that to continue.\n\nA smaller portion of growth \u201cwill come from the branches we're about to open, and those will continue to grow for decades,\u201d she said.\n\nWith the consumer bank, \u201con average, we've gained 30 basis points of share over the last 10 years,\u201d Lake noted. \u201cWe think that's a reasonable trajectory going forward, but in any one year it could be plus or minus of that.\u201d\n\nThe bank\u2019s credit-card business benefits when JPMorgan enters new markets with branches, she said. The bank is focused on investing in card segments where it continues to see outsized growth, including small business and affluent customers, Lake said.\n\n\u201cIt's about making sure we're capitalizing on our owned channels, so dot-com and branches, because they are the most efficient channels that we have, leveraging our data to make sure we're underwriting as deeply as we can, but profitably and with confidence,\u201d Lake said. \u201cAlso making sure that in addition to core card, we're innovating on installment lending and other lending options, like pay over time, which is gaining traction.\u201d\n\nThe bank, which counts a 17% share in the credit card market, is chasing a 20% target.\n\nWith both bank and credit card accounts, \u201cwe think that there\u2019s more share gains ahead of us. It\u2019s hard work,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is like a branch at a time, a vintage at a time, a tactic at a time. There\u2019s no silver bullet.\u201d\n\nFirst Republic opportunity\n\nWith the bank\u2019s integration of First Republic nearly complete \u2013 loan migration was still in process as of December \u2013 JPMorgan executives are optimistic about leveraging that for added growth. The bank acquired the failed lender in May 2023.\n\nJPMorgan retained 90% of bank clients, 95% of deposits and about 75% of advisers and wealth clients, making for a \u201cstable base,\u201d Lake said. JPMorgan also let go of some First Republic staffers, too, in 2023.\n\nJPMorgan has about 6 million affluent bank customers \u201cand only 15% of them invest with us today, and those customers have $7 trillion of investments,\u201d Lake said. \u201cSo we have happy Chase customers that are not yet enjoying the benefits of what we have to offer in wealth management.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan aims to court those customers for wealth management through the bank\u2019s concierge service, the coverage model and financial centers.\n\n\u201cFive years ago, we maybe didn't have all of the right capabilities and all of the right assets to be able to feel like we could invite those customers to do that with us, and feel confident that we would do an amazing job,\u201d Lake said. \u201cWe do now.\u201d",

Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 2.1%, which is below the industry average.\n\nJPMorgan Chase's Dividend Forecasted To Be Well Covered By Earnings\n\nIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 26%, which means that JPMorgan Chase would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.\n\nOver the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to expand by 2.3%. The future payout ratio could be 29% over that time period, according to analyst estimates, which is a good look for the future of the dividend.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Has A Solid Track Record\n\nEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.52 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of $5.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 13% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. JPMorgan Chase has impressed us by growing EPS at 13% per year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for JPMorgan Chase's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock\n\nOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.\n\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For instance, we've picked out that investors should take into consideration.

The plans would increase the size of the building by close to 50%, from 200,000 square feet to 290,000 square feet of offices with access to west-facing terraces on all floors.\n\nIn a filing on 30 December, Situs AMC, as special servicer to the London Office 2021 DAC commercial mortgage backed securitisation, said JP Morgan had completed the acquisition of two tranches of notes in the CMBS, the \u00a331.207 million Class B notes and the \u00a3100 million Class XB notes. Situs said it had previously recommended the sale as being liable to secure \"maximum return to debt holders\".\n\nThe agreement is a consensual restructuring between JP Morgan and Brookfield, which will see the latter continue to own the asset and continue to progress the required planning permissions and approvals for the redevelopment.\n\nJP Morgan provided a loan on 18 August 2021 of \u00a3164,250,000 to the Amber Milton Gate vehicle set up to buy the site. That was transferred to the London Office 2021 DAC CMBS on 16 December 2021.\n\nA special servicing transfer of the securitised senior loan took place on 21 October 2024. At the time, 201,666 square feet of the property was let to law firm Addleshaw Goddard for one year with an option to terminate the lease on or around 3 May 2025. The tenant has now served notice to terminate the lease.\n\nSitus, as special servicer, said it had discussed loan extension options with the operating adviser and the sponsor and no agreement was reached. It said discussions had also been held around the injection of additional equity but this had not been pursued.\n\nIt added a consensual sale had been considered and it was estimated that would provide \u00a3100 million for the asset and \u00a3105 million for the special purpose vehicle.\n\nIt added that JP Morgan as controlling class and Class A lender submitted a non-binding offer to buy the securitised senior loan by way of a \"credit bid in the amount of \u00a3131,400,000 representing a portion of the Class A Loan and the Issuer Loan\u201d.\n\nSitus said no competing bid has been received from the Class B noteholder and added that it had concluded the maximum return to the debt holders was represented by the loan sale.\n\nBrookfield bought Milton Gate from Chinese life insurance company Taikang Life for around \u00a3215 million in 2021. The entire property was let to Addleshaw Goddard on a single full repairing and insuring lease for 16 years and six months from 20 March 2008 expiring on 19 September 2024.\n\nIn 2022, Addleshaw Goddard completed a prelet of 114,000 square feet of offices for a relocation to Pembroke's 41 Lothbury in the City, in a deal revealed by CoStar News.\n\nIn London, Brookfield has developed over 3 million square feet including London Wall Place, Principal Place, 100 Bishopsgate, and One Leadenhall.\n\nBrookfield declined to comment.",

Morgan Self-Directed Investing shines\n\nEasy-to-use platform: With a single web trading platform, plus a mobile app, this is a straightforward way to get started investing in stocks and managing your portfolio.\n\nApp connects all Chase accounts: J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing is available within the Chase mobile app. If you\u2019re already a Chase customer, the ability to view all of your Chase accounts, from checking to investments, in one location may be very appealing to you.\n\nNo account minimum: With no account minimum, you can start saving and investing with whatever amount works for you.\n\nWhere J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing falls short\n\nLow interest rate on uninvested cash: Many of the brokers we review offer some way to grow your money, even when it's on the sidelines, by a few percent per year. But at J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing, your uninvested cash will earn an APY of just 0.01% per year. No cryptocurrencies, futures or forex: J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing has a more limited investment selection than some other brokers. It offers stocks (including fractional shares), bonds, funds (including some exchange-traded cryptocurrency funds) and options \u2014 but if you want to trade actual cryptocurrencies, futures or other assets, you're out of luck. Alternatives to consider: For interest on uninvested cash: Vanguard, Public For alternative assets: Interactive Brokers, Fidelity\n\nWhat type of investor should choose J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing?\n\nChase customers: Having a mobile investing platform that is integrated with all of your other bank accounts in the same app is a big plus.\n\nBond investors: J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing offers free Treasury bond trading, and competitive pricing on corporate, municipal, agency and international bond trades. It offers one of the widest bond selections of any broker we review.\n\nWhat the Nerds think \ud83e\udd13\n\nSam Taube, lead investing writer \"Chase users will enjoy the integration of J.P. Morgan's trading experience into the Chase mobile app. That said, the trading interface is fairly bare-bones, and the bank integration is not quite as smooth as other banks that also provide brokerage services. It takes several taps to get from the logged-in screen to a brokerage account screen you can trade from. But trading itself is pretty easy.\"\n\nJ.P. Morgan Self-Directed at a glance\n\nAccount minimum $0. Stock trading costs $0. Options trades $0 per trade + $0.65 per-contract fee. Account fees (annual, transfer, closing, inactivity) No annual or inactivity fees; $75 full ACAT transfer fee. No partial transfer fee. Tradable securities Stocks, ETFs, options, mutual funds, fractional shares (minimum $5), CDs, bonds (Treasuries, corporates, agency & municipal bonds and bond ETFs) Interest rate on uninvested cash 0.01%. Number of no-transaction-fee mutual funds About 3,000. Trading platform Web and mobile trading platform meet most investor needs. Mobile app The Chase mobile app seamlessly integrates the trading platform with all Chase products (including credit cards and bank accounts). Available for iOS and Android. Research and data Clients have free access to Morningstar analyst ratings, CFRA reports, and news feeds from Benzinga, Midnight Trader and Comtex. Customer support options (includes how easy it is to find key details on the website) Email 24/7.\n\nPhone and in person Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-9 p.m. Eastern, and Saturday 9 a.m.-5 p.m.\n\nSocial media Monday-Friday 7 a.m.-11 p.m. and Saturday-Sunday 10 a.m.-7 p.m.\n\nIn-person meetings at branches.\n\nHow to sign up for a J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing account\n\nExisting Chase customers will be happy to know that they don\u2019t need to download another app to access J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing accounts. All of Self-Directed Investing\u2019s offerings are available on the Chase mobile app, where users can research, trade and manage investments, in addition to accessing any other Chase accounts, such as credit cards or bank accounts.\n\nIf you\u2019re not an existing Chase bank customer, you can still open a Self-Directed Investing account.\n\nThe signup experience is generally quite smooth, although it can take a while to fund an account. J.P. Morgan does not have an \"instant deposit\" feature like some other brokers, so newly-deposited funds can sometimes take the better part of a week to become available for trading.\n\nWhat to know about J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing's fees\n\nJ.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing offers free stock trades, and its options pricing is pretty standard; just like with stock trading, you won\u2019t pay a per-trade commission. However, you will pay $0.65 per contract. (Options are typically grouped into contracts made up of 100 shares of the underlying stock.)\n\nJ.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing has a $0 account minimum, making any amount of money you\u2019ve saved enough to start investing. According to J.P. Morgan, you can invest as little as $1 in no-load mutual funds with no transaction fees.\n\nYou'll pay a $75 fee for full account transfers of assets, but $0 for partial transfers. Some brokers, such as Fidelity and Vanguard, don't charge this full transfer fee, but among those that do, $50 to $75 is fairly standard.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Self Directed Investing's trading platforms and apps\n\nFor Chase users, the mobile app works well to integrate various Chase financial products, such as checking and savings accounts, credit cards and investments. Through the app, users can trade stocks, bonds, mutual funds and ETFs, as well as access charting tools, screeners, J.P. Morgan research, stock watch lists and more. The app is available for iOS and Android; both versions have good reviews from users.\n\nHow we nerd out testing trading platforms Our reviewers \u2014 who are writers and editors on NerdWallet\u2019s content team \u2014 test every online broker platform in our analysis hands-on. That way, we can report on every aspect of the user experience, from funding a new account to placing trades. We score each broker against criteria that factor in the capabilities offered and the actual user experience of trading with those capabilities. This includes how easy it was to sign up for and fund a new account. Note that a broker may score very highly for the platforms it offers but low for the experience of actually using that platform. Our analysis scores these criteria separately and weighs them evenly when factored into the broker\u2019s overall score. As a result, a broker can offer an advanced trading platform. Still, if it is clunky to use or the process of opening an account is unnecessarily arduous, their score will reflect that.\n\nHowever, the trading experience felt slightly clunkier than those from similar bank-brokers, such as Merrill Edge (which is integrated into the Bank of America app, as Self-Directed Investing is into the Chase app). It takes several taps after logging into your Chase app to get to a screen where you can actually place a trade.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing does not accept payment for order flow (PFOF), a business model where customer orders are routed to trading firms for execution. Under some circumstances, PFOF brokers may have slower or less-price-efficient order execution than non-PFOF brokers. However, it's hard to say whether that's the case here, as J.P. Morgan declined to share data about its order execution quality with NerdWallet.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing's investment selection\n\nWhile Self-Directed Investing may be an excellent choice for the beginner investor, more advanced investors may find its offerings limited. Self-Directed Investing doesn\u2019t support investing in futures or forex. The broker does not allow access to initial public offerings (IPOs).\n\nHowever, J.P. Morgan is well-equipped for mutual fund investing. With roughly 3,000 no-transaction-fee mutual funds available from J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing, you shouldn\u2019t have a problem finding a mutual fund that fits your investing goals while still avoiding paying a transaction fee for it.\n\nJ.P. Morgan recently added support for fractional share investing \u2014 that is, users can buy less than 1 share of several hundred stocks and ETFs, for a minimum of $5. Some brokers don't offer fractional shares at all, but others have more extensive fractional share offerings that don't include minimums.\n\nSelf-Directed Investing users can buy Treasury bonds and bond ETFs for no additional fee, while corporate bonds, municipal bonds, government agency bonds and foreign bonds are available for an additional commission of $10 per trade plus $1 per bond, capped at $250.\n\nWhen it comes to margin rates, the high end of J.P. Morgan's range \u2014 the Prime rate plus 4.75%, or about 12.75% at the time of writing \u2014 is fairly standard among comparable brokers. However, users with higher account balances can get rates as low as 5.68% (technically the secured overnight financing rate plus 1.85%).\n\nOther key J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing features\n\nResearch and data\n\nInvestors have access to Morningstar analysis and CFRA reports (which are likely sufficient for most Self-Directed Investing users), and news feeds from Benzinga, Midnight Trader and Comtex, but the number of third-party research providers isn't as high as similar brokers.\n\nCustomer support\n\nJ.P. Morgan customer support is available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern, and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays. Users can also reach out via Facebook and Twitter Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern, and from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. If you\u2019d rather speak to someone in person, J.P. Morgan does have in-office visits during normal branch hours.\n\nJ.P. Morgan's educational content hub, \"The Know,\" offers thousands of articles and videos. Newsletters and webinars are also available. The Self-Directed Investing website is reasonably easy to navigate, although we could not easily find information on how to close an account.\n\nIRA account\n\nIn addition to standard brokerage accounts, J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing also offers both Roth and traditional IRAs, which are individual retirement accounts. Experts recommend using an IRA to save for retirement because doing so comes with significant tax benefits. You can have an IRA In addition to another brokerage account, as well as in addition to an employer retirement plan like a 401(k).\n\nJ.P. Morgan also offers one of the most extensive suites of retirement planning tools of any broker we review, including calculators, checklists and hundreds of articles.\n\nGood to know about J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing\n\nUnknown execution quality\n\nTypically, brokers share their execution quality with us as part of this review process. That's the percentage of trades that are executed at an equal or better price than the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO). However, J.P. Morgan did not disclose their execution quality to us. We've factored that lack of transparency into their score.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The average execution quality of all brokers we review was 96.95% as of Oct. 16, 2024. That means 96.95% of orders sold for at a price that was at or better than the National Best Bid and Offer. Executing at or above the NBBO means you may receive a price improvement or a better share price than you were originally quoted.\n\nLow interest rate on uninvested cash\n\nJ.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing offers money market funds, which often have yields of 4% or more. But unlike some other brokers, such as Fidelity or Vanguard, it doesn't offer users the option to sweep their uninvested cash into a money market fund by default. Instead, uninvested cash earns the rock-bottom interest rate of 0.01% per year.\n\nIs J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing safe?\n\nInvesting always means assuming some risk of loss. But J.P. Morgan is insured to protect your funds in the event that a banking crisis rendered it insolvent.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing accounts come with Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) coverage, which protects up to $500,000 per account (up to $250,000 of which can be cash). J.P. Morgan is also regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency, which ensure its compliance with securities laws and financial industry standards.\n\nIs J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing right for you?",

            "content": "Today, Dell\u2019s product line includes important memory storage devices, particularly the high-end server stacks in strong demand from AI developers and data center operators. Dell has solid institutional expertise in building high-quality computer systems, and the company has applied this to such leading applications as AI, data centers, and high-speed computing. The company boasts that it can supply these build-outs at any scale, from personal or small business to large enterprises.\n\nThe first stock we\u2019ll look at is Dell, a name that most of us know from the world of personal computers. Dell got its start \u2013 and built its reputation \u2013 as a maker of PCs and laptops marketed to the direct-to-consumer niche. Dell continues to be an important supplier for PCs and laptops, along with peripherals like monitors and gaming accessories. In 2016, Dell acquired EMC, the memory storage firm, and has since been expanding its business to offer the hardware products that support AI and networking applications.\n\nGetting to specifics, the bank\u2019s 5-star tech expert Samik Chatterjee has picked out two hardware stocks to watch next year. According to the TipRanks database , both of these picks are Buy-rated; let\u2019s find out why JPM sees them as solid choices for the coming year.\n\nAs the team puts it, \u201cWe expect the demand drivers for Hardware and Networking companies to broaden in 2025, moving beyond the narrow focus on AI investments and the limited driver of share price outperformance seen in 2024\u2026 Despite potential risks from tariffs affecting Hardware companies, we foresee a net positive set up for a broader range of customer verticals and end-markets to return to healthy spending levels compared to the depressed levels of 2024, while navigating macro headwinds. We expect that improving sentiment on behalf of customers, potentially lower corporate tax rates, and reduced capital costs, along with key customer verticals cycling past inventory digestion, will likely aid in broadening the revenue drivers for the Hardware industry beyond AI.\u201d\n\nThe equity research teams at JPMorgan are getting ready for next year by sifting through the markets to find stocks worth watching in 2025. They\u2019re looking by category \u2013 and in the tech world, they are advising investors not to forget to \u2018look beyond AI.\u2019\n\nWith New Year just around the corner, it\u2019s high time to get the ol\u2019 portfolio in order. While it might be somewhat arbitrary to choose this time to sort through stocks and find the best picks for the next year, it is wise to do so periodically \u2013 and the change on the calendar is as good a time as any.\n\nStory Continues\n\nProminent among Dell\u2019s recent products are its PowerEdge servers, capable of supporting the latest in AI and machine learning. Beyond AI, Dell\u2019s products are also capable of simplifying various IT operations. The servers support the automation and other tools needed for smooth system deployment, monitoring, and upgrading. In addition, Dell\u2019s servers are built with modern network security in mind, an essential feature in today\u2019s digital world, with so much of our sensitive data being stored electronically.\n\nIn Dell\u2019s last set of quarterly results, released for fiscal 3Q25, the company showed a top line of $24.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year \u2013 although missing the forecast by $356 million. At the bottom line, Dell realized non-GAAP earnings of $2.15 per share. This earnings figure was up 14% from the prior year and beat the estimates by 9 cents per share.\n\nThe company\u2019s results were driven by strong gains in the infrastructure solutions group segment and the servers and networking segment. The first of these generated $11.4 billion in revenue, up 34% year-over-year, while the second, at $7.4 billion, was up 58%.\n\nAs noted above, we\u2019re checking in with JPM\u2019s Samik Chatterjee. The analyst, who is rated by TipRanks among the top 3% of Wall Street\u2019s experts, points out that Dell\u2019s infrastructure business is outpacing its AI segments, writing, \u201cWe anticipate a broadening of demand drivers to include Traditional IT Infrastructure in 2025, moving beyond the focused investments in AI seen in 2024, which situates Dell as one of the best-positioned companies within our coverage, due to materially stronger core business growth. We estimate the earnings potential from Traditional Infrastructure demand, assuming a normal spending environment, to be ~$9 per share and project ~$2 per share of earnings potential from AI Infrastructure which supports a bull-case valuation that is materially higher than the current share price.\u201d\n\nChatterjee goes on to chart a course forward for DELL stock, adding, \u201cWith the Core business (ex-VMware resell and other) tracking to double-digit revenue growth, medium-term growth is expected to significantly exceed the +3% to +4% long-term growth previously outlined by the company, which in our view should justify a premium valuation in the mid-teens range.\u201d\n\nThe analyst\u2019s stance backs up his Overweight (Buy) rating on the shares, and his price target, set at $160, implies an upside for the coming year of 39%. (To watch Chatterjee\u2019s track record, click here.)\n\nDell has picked up 16 recent analyst reviews, and their breakdown, 14 Buys to 2 Holds, gives the stock its Strong Buy consensus rating. Dell\u2019s 12-month average price target of $149.72 suggests ~30% gain in 2025. (See DELL stock forecast.)\n\nCorning Incorporated (GLW)\n\nNext on our list is Corning Incorporated, a multinational tech company that focuses on the development and manufacture of high-end specialty products. Corning has been in business for over 170 years and has built up its own expertise in the science of glass and ceramics, as well as optical physics. The company\u2019s products include the damage-resistant glass used on mobile device display surfaces; precision glass products used on advanced display screens; and connectivity solutions, based on optical fibers, used to carry information on our networks.\n\nCorning\u2019s products are found in a wide range of technological areas, including life sciences, automotive markets, consumer electronics, display screens, and optical communications. The latter is growing increasingly important, especially as telecom and tech providers work to expand data networks and the rollout of 5G systems. All of those rely on fiber-optic cables, which are made from high-tech glass fibers. Corning\u2019s optics technology is in wide use in various industrial, networking, and scientific applications.\n\nAt the end of October, Corning announced an important collaboration with AT&T. Under the partnership, a multi-year purchase agreement, Corning will provide important technologies to the telecom giant. These will include the next generation of fiber, cable, and connectivity solutions capable of supporting AT&T\u2019s expanding fiber network and high-speed internet business.\n\nCorning recently reported results for 3Q24 and gave a top-line revenue total of $3.73 billion, edging over the forecast by over $9 million and growing by 8% year-over-year. The company also reported non-GAAP earnings of 54 cents per share, up 20% from the prior-year period and 2 cents per share better than had been expected.\n\nChatterjee, in his coverage of Corning, sees plenty of reasons why this stock is likely to show sound growth through next year. He says of the tech firm, \u201cCorning is well-positioned to benefit from several favorable trends, including continued Datacenter demand, recovery in demand from Telecom, medium-term tailwinds from government subsidies (BEAD) aimed helping Cable/MSO capex, recovery in TV display unit demand helped by government subsidies in China, recovery in Smartphone sales, and steady improvement in Life Sciences demand. Driven by a cyclical recovery across various diversified end-markets and continued robust Datacenter demand, we forecast Corning to deliver high-single digit revenue growth, significant operating leverage, and stronger growth in free cash flow generation.\u201d\n\nBased on these comments, Chatterjee sets an Overweight (Buy) rating on GLW shares, which he complements with a $60 price target that points toward an upside potential of 26% for the stock on the one-year horizon.\n\nOverall, Corning\u2019s shares hold a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 6 Buys and 3 Holds. GLW\u2019s 12-month average price target of $53.57 implies gains of 13% in the year ahead. (See GLW stock forecast.)\n\nTo find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019 Best Stocks to Buy, a tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

(NYSE:RDDT) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nAs reported by Reuters, Wall Street\u2019s major indexes started the final trading session of 2024 on a high note, continuing the two-year-long bull market. This was marked by economic recovery after the pandemic, hopes for lower interest rates, and excitement about the AI boom. All three major stock market indexes, the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq, are near record highs and ready for their second consecutive year of gains.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 10 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss\n\nDespite an overall good year, late 2024 saw a pullback in artificial intelligence stocks. From profit-taking and investors locking in gains from the year's substantial rallies to concerns over high valuations and the Federal Reserve's cautious stance signaling fewer interest rate cuts in 2025, the sector was a bit \u201cchoppier\u201d than usual these last few weeks.\n\nHowever, Wall Street analysts expect that the artificial intelligence sector will be in full gear in 2025, with a $2 trillion surge in AI-related capital expenditure over the next three years. Moreover, regulatory discussions around AI ethics and safety, spearheaded by global governments, are creating a supportive environment for innovation.\n\n\"We believe tech stocks will be robust in 2025 on the shoulders of the AI Revolution and $2 trillion+ of incremental AI capex (spending) over the next 3 years\u201d.\n\nAccording to Ives, tech stocks are anticipated to rise 25% in 2025 as Wall Street and investors deal with \"a less regulatory spiderweb\" under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. He also believes that stronger artificial intelligence initiatives in the federal government should give the sector a boost. However, there may be \"white-knuckle moments\" in the year ahead over Federal Reserve decisions, uncertainty over U.S.-China tariffs, and concerns from critics who believe stock valuations are too high.\n\n\"This will create the opportunities to own the tech theme and key names which has been our core investing tech playbook the last 2 years\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Designed by Norman Foster of Foster + Partners with Adamson Associates as the architect of record and developed by Tishman Speyer, the 60-story skyscraper will yield 2.5 million square feet of office space with a capacity of 15,000 employees, and will become the tallest structure in New York completely powered by hydroelectric energy. The property occupies a full city block bound by East 48th Street to the north, East 47th Street to the south, Park Avenue to the east, and Madison Avenue to the west.\n\nThe tower crane was dismantled and more of the dark, reflective glass and bronze-hued cladding have enclosed the skyscraper since our last update in late August, when portions of the fa\u00e7ade had just reached the flat roof parapet. The signature diagrid of bronze beams is now in place up to the third setback, with only two more diamond patterns left to finish on the eastern and western faces. Signs of interior work are also visible across multiple sections of the building.\n\nWork is also progressing on the base of the skyscraper, with more sections of the glass envelope in place behind the massive fanning perimeter columns.\n\nInstallation has also begun on the precast stone panels surrounding the western lobby entrance along Madison Avenue. The following rendering depicts these walls covered in hanging vegetation, creating a striking contrast with the angular glass and metal surfaces of the tower above.\n\nEast 47th Street has reopened to traffic since our summer update, when crews were in the process of re-strengthening the roadway. Portions of the sidewalk shed have been removed from the base of the building, replaced by barriers and chain link fencing, and work has begun on the sidewalk bollards lining the forthcoming curb along Park Avenue, as seen in the below rendering by DBOX.\n\n270 Park Avenue\u2019s construction has involved more than 300 Local 40 ironworkers, multiple crane operators, and several hundred electrical, plumbing, and mechanical engineers. Other contributing teams include MEP engineer JB&B; steelwork supplier Banker Steel, which is manufacturing 93,600 tons of recycled steel; steel subcontractor NYC Constructors; structural foundation designer Mueser Rutledge Consulting Engineers; structural engineer Severud Associates; hoisting and scaffolding provider Safway Atlantic by BrandSafway Scaffolding Systems; curtain wall supplier New Hudson Fa\u00e7ades; and BMU supplier R&R Scaffolding Companies.\n\nThe supertall office skyscraper project is expected to generate over 8,000 jobs by the end of construction, spanning 40 local unions and producing $2.6 billion of economic activity for New York City. JPMorgan Chase is also expected to contribute $29.8 billion annually to the city\u2019s economy and stimulate an additional 40,000 jobs across local industries.\n\nYIMBY estimates 270 Park Avenue will finish construction before the end of summer 2025.\n\nSubscribe to YIMBY\u2019s daily e-mail\n\n\n\nFollow YIMBYgram for real-time photo updates\n\nLike YIMBY on Facebook\n\nFollow YIMBY\u2019s Twitter for the latest in YIMBYnews",

            "content": "The board of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 31st of January, with investors receiving $1.25 per share. Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 2.1%, which is below the industry average.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for JPMorgan Chase\n\nJPMorgan Chase's Payment Expected To Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has a long history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at a minimum of 10 years. Based on JPMorgan Chase's last earnings report, the payout ratio is at a decent 26%, meaning that the company is able to pay out its dividend with a bit of room to spare.\n\nOver the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to expand by 6.6%. Analysts forecast the future payout ratio could be 29% over the same time horizon, which is a number we think the company can maintain.\n\nNYSE:JPM Historic Dividend December 31st 2024\n\nJPMorgan Chase Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.52 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $5.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 13% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. JPMorgan Chase has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 13% per annum. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for JPMorgan Chase's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.\n\nWe Really Like JPMorgan Chase's Dividend\n\nOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.\n\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for JPMorgan Chase that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

Its adjusted EPS for the last reported quarter grew marginally to $4.37, exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates by 8.7%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts project JPMorgan to report an adjusted EPS of $17.31, up 3% from $16.80 reported in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2025, its earnings are expected to dip 3.1% year-over-year to $16.77.\n\nJPM stock prices have soared 40.7% over the past 52 weeks, significantly outperforming the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLF) 28.4% surge and the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX) 23.8% gains during the same time frame.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s stock prices surged over 4.4% after the release of its impressive Q3 results on Oct. 11. The company reported a robust 7% year-over-year growth in total net revenues to approximately $42.7 billion, which exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations by a notable 3.9%. Its investment banking fees surged 29.6% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, while its asset management fees grew 14.7% compared to the year-ago quarter to $4.5 billion. Furthermore, in consumer & community banking JPMorgan was ranked 1 in U.S. retail deposits for the fourth consecutive year. Meanwhile, it acquired about 2.5 million accounts during the quarter and delivered an 11.2% growth in card income to $1.3 billion.\n\nHowever, its profitability took a hit due to a massive 124.8% increase in provision for credit losses, reaching $3.1 billion. This led to a 1.2% year-over-year decline in net income to shareholders amounting to $12.5 billion.\n\nNevertheless, analysts remain optimistic about JPMorgan\u2019s prospects. It has a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating, out of the 21 analysts covering the JPM stock, 11 recommend \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d two advocate \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d seven recommend \u201cHold,\u201d and one advises a \u201cStrong Sell\u201d rating. Its mean price target of $245.65 represents a modest 2.6% premium to current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Contrary to those representations, on a number of occasions JPMorgan employees knew that the securities did not comply with those underwriting guidelines, the Justice Department said.\n\nThe final issue in the settlement revolved around the $4 billion to compensate consumers. Some $1.5 billion will be a write-down to reduce the principal of homeowner loans; $300 million will enable homeowners to pay less now on their mortgages; and the remainder of the $4 billion will go toward reducing mortgage interest rates, originating new loans and helping revive blighted properties in some of the hardest-hit areas of the housing crisis.\n\nAn independent monitor will be appointed to oversee the assistance to homeowners.\n\nStill to come is a decision on whether the Justice Department will file criminal charges against JPMorgan.

Turley's BrokerCheck page lists 13 customer complaints against him.\n\nTwelve of those complaints were settled by J.P. Morgan Securities (the brokerage business the megabank acquired from Bear Stearns in 2008) between 2020 and this year for a total of $63.2 million. Turley denied the earliest of the 13 complaints, which was filed in 1999 when Turley was at Lehman Brothers.\n\nRather than allot JPMorgan the damages it had requested, the three-member FINRA arbitration panel overseeing the case awarded Turley $521,000 to cover his attorneys' fees and other costs. In approving that amount, the arbitrators cited California statutes providing reimbursement of legal expenses. As is common in FINRA arbitration decisions, the panelists did not go into their reasons for the decision.\n\nThe award notes that J.P. Morgan Securities accused Turley of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.\n\n\"The causes of action related to Claimant's allegation that Respondent was a former financial advisor with Claimant who unjustly enriched himself by brazenly lying to Claimant and breaching its policies over several years,\" according to the award.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nEx-J.P.

Morgan to pay $4M amid surge of complaints involving fired broker\n\n7 enforcement trends and notable cases in 2022\n\nJPMorgan wealth subsidiaries pay $151M SEC settlement\n\nJPMorgan declined to comment on the award. Turley's lawyer, Andrew Harvin of Doyle, Restrepo, Harvin and Robbins in Houston, said his colleagues and his client were \"very pleased that Ed has been vindicated.\"\n\n\"It shows this claim by JPMorgan should have never been brought in the first place,\" he said.\n\nLou Straney, a regulatory expert at Arbitration Insight , said it's highly unusual for a broker to prevail against a firm's claims in a case like this. He said he wouldn't be surprised if JPMorgan tries to appeal the decision.\n\nStraney said the award makes Turley almost seem like an innocent bystander.\n\n\"But he's been barred by FINRA,\" Straney said. \"That alone is usually enough to get you pretty far down the road and for the firm to be able to recover some money.\"\n\nTurley was a star broker at JPMorgan , generating about $30 million a year from $1.6 billion in assets under management, according to a detailed briefing of the case posted on the website of the Law Offices of Robert Wayne Pearce. Pearce represented several former clients of Turley's, including one in Texas who filed a claim for $55 million for unsuitable trading, misrepresentation and other alleged violations. Pearce, who declined to comment for this article, wrote that Turley would visit the wealthy client in Texas about once a quarter by flying his own jet across the country to \"wine, dine, and curry favor\" with him and his family.\n\nTurley logged 28 years in the securities industry before being fired by JPMorgan in August 2021 over a \"loss of confidence concerning adherence to firm policies and brokerage order handling requirements,\" according to BrokerCheck. He was barred by FINRA in November the following year after refusing to provide testimony concerning \"trading in customer accounts, including but not limited to the use of foreign currency and margin, and the purchasing and selling of high-yield bonds and preferred stock.\"",

(NASDAQ:MU) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nFamously known as the \u201cgodfather of artificial intelligence\u201d, British-Canadian computer scientist Professor Geoffrey Hinton has recently warned that the pace of technological change today is much faster than was initially anticipated. As a result, there is a 10% to 20% chance that artificial intelligence will wipe out humanity within the next three decades. Previously, he had said there was only a 10% chance of technology doing so.\n\nREAD NOW: Top 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm\n\nDespite such warnings, companies are racing to lead the AI arms race. OpenAI, for instance, which is also known as the company that started the race itself, has recently outlined plans to revamp its structure. The company said that it would create a public benefit corporation so that it would make it easier to raise more capital.\n\nReuters reported the news back in September, which had sparked debate among corporate watchdogs and tech moguls regarding whether the company would be able to allocate its assets to the nonprofit arm fairly, and whether the company would be able to strike a balance between making a profit and breeding public good as it develops AI.\n\n\"We once again need to raise more capital than we'd imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness. The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission\u201d.\n\nThe company plans to turn its for-profit branch into a Delaware public benefit corporation (PBC), aligning its structure with rivals such as Anthropic and Musk\u2019s xAI, which use a similar structure and have recently raised billions in funding.\n\n\"The key to the announcement is that the for-profit side of OpenAI 'will run and control OpenAI's operations and business. This is the critical step the company needs to make in order to continue fund raising,\" Luria said, although he added that the move did \"not necessitate OpenAI going public\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).",

            "content": "Quick look: Chase Private Client vs. J.P. Morgan Private Client\n\nLet's take a quick tour to set the stage for some of the weirdness between these two banking options. First, the same parent company, J.P. Morgan Chase, owns both Chase Bank and J.P. Morgan. They offer similar-sounding services that often overlap. You can open a Chase Private Client checking and savings account through Chase or J.P. Morgan, for example.\n\nIt's very confusing, but there's a reason for all the madness. In 2023, J.P. Morgan Chase actually acquired First Republic Bank after its high-profile failure, one of the few times in recent years when the FDIC actually stepped in to protect people's insured deposits.\n\nSince then, it's been trying to merge First Republic Bank's services with the broader J.P. Morgan Chase empire \u2014 minus the parts that caused it to fail (like cheap mortgages). What worked well at First Republic was catering to the uber-rich with private banking services, and it developed a reputation for having the best customer service around. This led to the rebranding from the failed First Republic Bank to the rising-from-the-ashes phoenix, J.P. Morgan Private Client.\n\nYou'll probably see these services change over the years, especially as J.P. Morgan Private Client tries to figure out its place in the world. But, as of this writing, here are some of the major differences between the two.\n\n\n\nChase Private Client\n\nJ.P. Morgan Private Client Best for Newly high-net-worth individuals looking to grow Discerning higher-net-worth individuals Open to new customers Yes Only to current J.P. Morgan Chase customers and prospects Available banking services Savings\n\nChecking\n\nHome lending\n\nAuto loans\n\nPersonal banking\n\nBusiness banking\n\nInvestment services Savings\n\nChecking\n\nCredit cards\n\nHome lending\n\nPersonal banking\n\nBusiness banking\n\nInvestment services Minimum balance No minimum to open, but you'll need $150,000 in combined deposits and investments to waive the monthly checking fee (unless you have a linked Chase Platinum Business Checking account) $750,000 or more in combined deposits and investments Important fees $35 per month if you don't meet the checking account fee waiver requirements\n\nAnnual fee of 1.45% of assets under management for investment advisory services Potential monthly fee for a Chase Private Client Checking account\n\nAnnual fee of 1.45% of assets under management for investment advisory services Main features Personal Chase Private Client Banker\n\nPersonal investment advisor\n\nJ.P. Morgan Wealth Plan\n\nChase Business Relationship Manager\n\n0.25% interest rate discount on auto loans\n\nMore waived fees for ATM withdrawals, wire transfers, overdrafts, etc.\n\nPotential bonuses for new customers Higher-end concierge service\n\nSpecial interest rates on savings products\n\nPersonal relationship manager\n\nPersonal investment advisor\n\nIt's important to note that this isn't an exhaustive list of all fees, services, and features. Private banking services don't always publicly declare specific details on their offerings since they're catering to a richer clientele than the general public. Simply put, top-notch service is often a higher priority for these customers than the lowest loan rates and ways to avoid paying fees.\n\nWhen you should pick Chase Private Client\n\nChase Private Client and J.P. Morgan Private Client both offer similar services within the J.P. Morgan Chase ecosystem (say that 10 times quickly). However, Chase's Private Client services are more applicable to the general public, and that may be better in some cases. Let's look at some reasons why you might choose Chase Private Client over J.P. Morgan Private Client.\n\nYou're new to the J.P. Morgan Chase ecosystem\n\nA company representative confirmed that J.P. Morgan Private Client services are only open to current customers and prospects of J.P. Morgan Chase (i.e., J.P. Morgan or Chase Bank), not the general public. Unless you deposit at least $750,000 in funds with either bank first, you can't skip to enrolling in J.P. Morgan Private Client services like you can with Chase.\n\nYou're not eligible for J.P. Morgan Private Client\n\nWhenever J.P. Morgan Chase does decide to open J.P. Morgan Private Client to the general public, you'll still generally be funneled to Chase Private Client services if you have less than $750,000 across your bank and brokerage accounts with J.P. Morgan Chase. You won't need that large sum to qualify as a Chase Private Client customer.\n\nHowever, unless you're also a Chase Platinum Business Checking customer, you'll still need at least $150,000 in combined deposits to avoid the pricey $35 monthly fee for your Chase Private Client Checking account.\n\nYou want an established private banking firm with defined benefits\n\nRight now, the biggest benefit of going with Chase Private Client is that you have a better idea of what you're going to get. It's a well-known service that the bank has offered since 2007, so there's a long track record of actual customers who've reported their experiences.\n\nChase is more open and upfront on its website about what you'll get as a Chase Private Client member, including:\n\n0.25% discount on auto loan rates\n\nFewer fees for your checking account and select services\n\nCD ladder access\n\nHigher limits on transfers and withdrawal activities\n\nJ.P. Morgan Private Client Advisor access for investment services\n\nTickets to invite-only sporting matches, cultural events, and financial seminars\n\nPlus, you'll have a Chase Private Client Banker who serves as your go-to for managing the various program benefits. If you're also a small business owner, Chase will put you in touch with a Chase Business Relationship Manager who can help you find the right services and support needed to grow your business. Finally, Chase maintains a 24/7 support line for Private Client customers.\n\nWhen you should pick J.P. Morgan Private Client\n\nJ.P. Morgan generally caters to a more monied crowd. After all, it's one of the best banks for corporations and governments. However, it also offers banking services for individuals who have enough money.\n\nGiven the institution's high-profile stature, it's no surprise that J.P. Morgan Private Client is a better match if you're looking for something out of the ordinary in a field that's already more removed from the hoi polloi. Below are some more reasons to choose it.\n\nYou're transitioning from First Republic Bank\n\nWhen J.P. Morgan Chase absorbed First Republic Bank in 2023, it didn't just open a basic new Chase bank account for everyone and transfer their entire balance over. First Republic Bank made a name for itself in offering superior service to high-net-worth clients, after all \u2013 complete with fresh-baked cookies and free umbrellas at the branches.\n\nTo keep these customers happy and avoid losing them in a mass exodus, J.P. Morgan created an entirely new division. It was a blend of J.P. Morgan's offerings for the uber-wealthy paired up with Chase Private Client's already-proven services and a dash of the old spice (yes, even the umbrellas and the cookies).\n\nIt called the new services J.P. Morgan Private Client, which was intended to serve as a gateway for incoming First Republic Bank customers to access new services and existing Chase Bank offerings. True to the bank's mission, it reported in May 2024 that 85% of the former First Republic Bank customers transferred over had stayed on with J.P. Morgan Chase.\n\nYou want the best service possible\n\nOne of the biggest ways that J.P. Morgan Private Client is trying to distinguish itself from Chase Private Client is by offering high-quality service that even the best banks can't match. In fact, it offers concierge-level service with one dedicated Relationship Manager who'll \"anticipate your needs\" and serve as your go-between for any other J.P. Morgan Chase services you're eligible for, including those through Chase Private Client.\n\nTip While Chase Private Client offers a similar approach with its Private Client Banker benefit, J.P. Morgan Private Client implies that you'll receive higher-level support.\n\nYou're not afraid of being a guinea pig\n\nThere's no getting around it: J.P. Morgan Private Client is new, and new things often go through trials and growing pains. J.P. Morgan Chase just announced it in May 2024, and by October 2024, it had only opened two J.P. Morgan Financial Centers to serve Private Client customers: one in New York and the other in San Francisco. It designed these centers to emulate the old First Republic Bank branches, right down to the luxury finishes inside.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Chase plans to open 30 more of these centers before the end of 2026, but until they materialize, they're just plans and not actual places. In fact, even in the announcement of J.P. Morgan Private Client, company executives noted that their loyalty was first toward existing affluent Chase customers, and the primary goal was to get a bigger \"share of their overall wallet.\"\n\nThe new J.P. Morgan Private Client services serve as a learning tool for this end with all other plans being flexible around that goal.\n\nWhich is the better high-net-worth banking option?\n\nIf I were more concerned about opulent touches and one-on-one service \u2014 and had the bucks to back it up \u2014 I'd likely choose J.P. Morgan Private Client over Chase Private Client due to its superior concierge service.\n\nI'd also keep in mind that the service offerings, quality, and pricing may change as it gets its legs under it. (Plus, now that the bank has hyped them up so much, I'm curious about those cookies.)\n\nOn the other hand, if I wasn't able to qualify for J.P. Morgan Private Client, then Chase Private Client would be an acceptable backup. Many of the services you'd get through the J.P. Morgan side of things are handled by Chase Private Client offerings anyway. You'll just get better handholding if you opt for J.P. Morgan.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs J.P. Morgan the same as Chase Bank? Yes and no. J.P. Morgan and Chase Bank are separate banks, but they're subsidiaries of the same company called, confusingly enough, J.P. Morgan Chase. While J.P. Morgan focuses more on corporations and wealthier people, Chase focuses more on everyday people. How much money do you need for J.P. Morgan Private Client? You'll need at least $750,000 in deposits across your J.P. Morgan Chase bank and investing accounts to access J.P. Morgan Private Client services. Is J.P. Morgan Private Client better than Chase Private Client? Generally, yes. J.P. Morgan Private Client aims to provide better service to people with more money. However, since J.P. Morgan Private Client is a new division formed after Chase acquired another bank catering to wealthy clients, some customers have reported growing pains, such as long waits for customer support and problems with card payments.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you're able to meet J.P. Morgan Private Client's minimum balance requirements, I would recommend it over Chase Private Client. Still, both options are strong neck-in-neck contenders. The base services should be roughly the same but with better holistic guidance on the J.P. Morgan side of things to bring it all together.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Private Client has three strikes against it with its limited availability, high minimum balance requirements, and new business model that could likely change in the future (hopefully for the better). J.P. Morgan says it'll fix at least two of those things going forward, so we'll see if it keeps its word.\n\nIf you want to explore other options, our list of the best banks for high-net-worth individuals has some recommendations.\n\n",

            "content": "With New Year just around the corner, it\u2019s high time to get the ol\u2019 portfolio in order. While it might be somewhat arbitrary to choose this time to sort through stocks and find the best picks for the next year, it is wise to do so periodically \u2013 and the change on the calendar is as good a time as any.\n\nThe equity research teams at JPMorgan are getting ready for next year by sifting through the markets to find stocks worth watching in 2025. They\u2019re looking by category \u2013 and in the tech world, they are advising investors not to forget to \u2018look beyond AI.\u2019\n\nAs the team puts it, \u201cWe expect the demand drivers for Hardware and Networking companies to broaden in 2025, moving beyond the narrow focus on AI investments and the limited driver of share price outperformance seen in 2024\u2026 Despite potential risks from tariffs affecting Hardware companies, we foresee a net positive set up for a broader range of customer verticals and end-markets to return to healthy spending levels compared to the depressed levels of 2024, while navigating macro headwinds. We expect that improving sentiment on behalf of customers, potentially lower corporate tax rates, and reduced capital costs, along with key customer verticals cycling past inventory digestion, will likely aid in broadening the revenue drivers for the Hardware industry beyond AI.\u201d\n\nGetting to specifics, the bank\u2019s 5-star tech expert Samik Chatterjee has picked out two hardware stocks to watch next year. According to the TipRanks database, both of these picks are Buy-rated; let\u2019s find out why JPM sees them as solid choices for the coming year.\n\nDell Technologies, Inc. (DELL)\n\nThe first stock we\u2019ll look at is Dell, a name that most of us know from the world of personal computers. Dell got its start \u2013 and built its reputation \u2013 as a maker of PCs and laptops marketed to the direct-to-consumer niche. Dell continues to be an important supplier for PCs and laptops, along with peripherals like monitors and gaming accessories. In 2016, Dell acquired EMC, the memory storage firm, and has since been expanding its business to offer the hardware products that support AI and networking applications.\n\nToday, Dell\u2019s product line includes important memory storage devices, particularly the high-end server stacks in strong demand from AI developers and data center operators. Dell has solid institutional expertise in building high-quality computer systems, and the company has applied this to such leading applications as AI, data centers, and high-speed computing. The company boasts that it can supply these build-outs at any scale, from personal or small business to large enterprises.\n\nProminent among Dell\u2019s recent products are its PowerEdge servers, capable of supporting the latest in AI and machine learning. Beyond AI, Dell\u2019s products are also capable of simplifying various IT operations. The servers support the automation and other tools needed for smooth system deployment, monitoring, and upgrading. In addition, Dell\u2019s servers are built with modern network security in mind, an essential feature in today\u2019s digital world, with so much of our sensitive data being stored electronically.\n\nIn Dell\u2019s last set of quarterly results, released for fiscal 3Q25, the company showed a top line of $24.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year \u2013 although missing the forecast by $356 million. At the bottom line, Dell realized non-GAAP earnings of $2.15 per share. This earnings figure was up 14% from the prior year and beat the estimates by 9 cents per share.\n\nThe company\u2019s results were driven by strong gains in the infrastructure solutions group segment and the servers and networking segment. The first of these generated $11.4 billion in revenue, up 34% year-over-year, while the second, at $7.4 billion, was up 58%.\n\nAs noted above, we\u2019re checking in with JPM\u2019s Samik Chatterjee. The analyst, who is rated by TipRanks among the top 3% of Wall Street\u2019s experts, points out that Dell\u2019s infrastructure business is outpacing its AI segments, writing, \u201cWe anticipate a broadening of demand drivers to include Traditional IT Infrastructure in 2025, moving beyond the focused investments in AI seen in 2024, which situates Dell as one of the best-positioned companies within our coverage, due to materially stronger core business growth. We estimate the earnings potential from Traditional Infrastructure demand, assuming a normal spending environment, to be ~$9 per share and project ~$2 per share of earnings potential from AI Infrastructure which supports a bull-case valuation that is materially higher than the current share price.\u201d\n\nChatterjee goes on to chart a course forward for DELL stock, adding, \u201cWith the Core business (ex-VMware resell and other) tracking to double-digit revenue growth, medium-term growth is expected to significantly exceed the +3% to +4% long-term growth previously outlined by the company, which in our view should justify a premium valuation in the mid-teens range.\u201d\n\nThe analyst\u2019s stance backs up his Overweight (Buy) rating on the shares, and his price target, set at $160, implies an upside for the coming year of 39%. (To watch Chatterjee\u2019s track record, click here.)\n\nDell has picked up 16 recent analyst reviews, and their breakdown, 14 Buys to 2 Holds, gives the stock its Strong Buy consensus rating. Dell\u2019s 12-month average price target of $149.72 suggests ~30% gain in 2025. (See DELL stock forecast.)\n\nCorning Incorporated (GLW)\n\nNext on our list is Corning Incorporated, a multinational tech company that focuses on the development and manufacture of high-end specialty products. Corning has been in business for over 170 years and has built up its own expertise in the science of glass and ceramics, as well as optical physics. The company\u2019s products include the damage-resistant glass used on mobile device display surfaces; precision glass products used on advanced display screens; and connectivity solutions, based on optical fibers, used to carry information on our networks.\n\nCorning\u2019s products are found in a wide range of technological areas, including life sciences, automotive markets, consumer electronics, display screens, and optical communications. The latter is growing increasingly important, especially as telecom and tech providers work to expand data networks and the rollout of 5G systems. All of those rely on fiber-optic cables, which are made from high-tech glass fibers. Corning\u2019s optics technology is in wide use in various industrial, networking, and scientific applications.\n\nAt the end of October, Corning announced an important collaboration with AT&T. Under the partnership, a multi-year purchase agreement, Corning will provide important technologies to the telecom giant. These will include the next generation of fiber, cable, and connectivity solutions capable of supporting AT&T\u2019s expanding fiber network and high-speed internet business.\n\nCorning recently reported results for 3Q24 and gave a top-line revenue total of $3.73 billion, edging over the forecast by over $9 million and growing by 8% year-over-year. The company also reported non-GAAP earnings of 54 cents per share, up 20% from the prior-year period and 2 cents per share better than had been expected.\n\nChatterjee, in his coverage of Corning, sees plenty of reasons why this stock is likely to show sound growth through next year. He says of the tech firm, \u201cCorning is well-positioned to benefit from several favorable trends, including continued Datacenter demand, recovery in demand from Telecom, medium-term tailwinds from government subsidies (BEAD) aimed helping Cable/MSO capex, recovery in TV display unit demand helped by government subsidies in China, recovery in Smartphone sales, and steady improvement in Life Sciences demand. Driven by a cyclical recovery across various diversified end-markets and continued robust Datacenter demand, we forecast Corning to deliver high-single digit revenue growth, significant operating leverage, and stronger growth in free cash flow generation.\u201d\n\nBased on these comments, Chatterjee sets an Overweight (Buy) rating on GLW shares, which he complements with a $60 price target that points toward an upside potential of 26% for the stock on the one-year horizon.\n\nOverall, Corning\u2019s shares hold a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 6 Buys and 3 Holds. GLW\u2019s 12-month average price target of $53.57 implies gains of 13% in the year ahead.
