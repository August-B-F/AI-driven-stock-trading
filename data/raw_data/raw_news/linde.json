            "content": "Lenox \u2014 You will not believe your ears. These guys are smoking hot, and they are coming to the Linde Center for Music and Learning on Friday, April 4.\n\nAlfredo Rodriguez and longtime sidemen Han Beyle and Michael Olivera have virtuosic chops to spare, and they use them to play latin jazz at the very highest level, with Rodriguez on keyboards, Olivera on percussion, and Beyle on bass.\n\nI spoke with Rodriguez this week by telephone to get a better idea of what to expect on April 4. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nHow important to your music is your Cuban heritage?\n\nI always say that I play what I live. So obviously, being from Cuba is part of my heritage, my blood, my roots, and Cuba is always very present, alive when I am on the stage, when I play music. Basically, it\u2019s part of who I am. So that was why I started saying that I play what I live because, for me, it\u2019s very simple to have Cuban influences in my music since I was born in Cuba and I left, and I always say left physically because, spiritually, I am always in Cuba and always thinking about it and basically dedicating my life and my music to it. But unfortunately, physically, I haven\u2019t been there too much for so many years and lately, but Cuba is part of me.\n\nDid you have to leave Cuba in order to understand your musical roots there?\n\nNo, not really. In Cuba, we\u2019ve been isolated for so many years. So speaking about Cuba, it\u2019s a country that is very\u2026 How can I say this? We have had a big contradiction in our country for so many years because it has been a dictatorship for almost 70 years, which means that almost everything is Cuban. Even in a world that we live right now, very multicultural and we see a lot of trans-culturation in many countries. The United States is one of the most important countries when it comes to that\u2014mixing cultures. In Cuba, it\u2019s not like that. We still are in a country that my parents are Cuban, my grandparents are Cuban, my great-grandparents\u2014everyone is Cuban for so many years because we haven\u2019t had most confrontation, most trans-culturation through the years because of the political situation in Cuba and also because we are an island, so we don\u2019t have anyone closer to us. And also, it\u2019s because of the political situation in Cuba.\n\nSometimes when you live in a country abroad, then you see your previous life with a different perspective. And for sure that has happened to me living in the United States. It\u2019s not the same picture in my country while I am traveling the whole world. Right now, I am in Palermo, Italy. And as I travel the whole world playing my music, I see Cuba with different eyes now. When I was there, it is in my blood and my roots and it\u2019s everything that I see, but you start seeing it from a different point of view. But definitely, I understood Cuban culture and Cuban music since the beginning, because it\u2019s all what we had.\n\nHow did a Grammy nomination change you and your music?\n\nThat\u2019s a very tough question. I think prizes are very important when it comes to developing the business side of my career, which is very important for me, and I pay a lot of attention to it.\n\nBut when it comes to my music, it doesn\u2019t change much. When it comes to my personality, it doesn\u2019t change much. And I hope I continue to be like this forever, because I don\u2019t think prizes are that important. Sometimes it disorients us instead of helping us to focus on what is really important, which for me are the simple things in life. And definitely, prizes are not.\n\nSo I will say that more importantly for me, when it comes to changing my life, it has to be the presence of people, meeting great, extraordinary human beings who do very well in what they do in life and support very good things for our societies in all countries. And to be honest, that\u2019s more than enough.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m very grateful when we get a result, a success through prizes, through people, important people who come to me and tell me that I\u2019m a really good musician or things like that. But to be honest, I\u2019ve been the same Alfredo since I was a little kid, four or five, three years old. I\u2019ve been playing music because, for me, it has been a necessity.\n\nFor me, music is like drinking water, and I hope to continue like this forever. That\u2019s what is most important for me, feeling grateful and thankful every day that I wake up and I feel I have one more day in order to keep learning and to keep trying in the pursuit of happiness. That\u2019s it for me: my family, my friends, my music, sitting at the piano, and performing all over the world.\n\nTell us more about your sidemen.\n\nI\u2019m bringing my trio, who has accompanied me for a long time. My drummer and I started together in Cuba, and we\u2019ve been playing on and off for more than 20 years. He\u2019s coming with me. And then the bass player is from Azerbaijan. I like to bring musicians from different cultures to my music and adapt and learn from them. His name is Han Beyle. He lives in Miami. I\u2019ve been based in Miami for the last five years, and I met him there, and he\u2019s an extraordinary bass player, and we can\u2019t wait to share our music, our life with your audience.\n\nWe like to listen to each other, like this conversation, because it\u2019s an interview and I\u2019m talking a lot, but when it comes to music, that\u2019s not the situation. I like to listen to the musicians who are with me. I like to give them freedom and leverage to be themselves, and I like to collaborate and improvise and just be honest and open when we are on the stage.\n\nSo that\u2019s the main message: try to welcome different cultures into your life, try to have a good time, and motivate and inspire people with what we do best, which I think is music.",

Here\u2019s why\n\nSmaller increase in maize prices\n\nVan der Linde said the improved crop production at the start of the 2025 planting season should help control food prices later in the year.\n\n\u201cReliable crop production estimates for South Africa paint an encouraging picture, with maize prices having shifted lower since the start of 2025.\n\n\u201cAlthough we expect inflation readings to drift higher over the coming months, the pace should be gradual, with food prices expected to remain reasonably contained,\u201d he explained.\n\nCommercial maize production\n\nVan der Linde adds that, having seen the back of El Ni\u00f1o in 2024, South Africa could yield a commercial maize production of about 14.6 million tonnes in 2025, slightly more than the initial forecast of 13.9 million tonnes, Department of Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries data shows.\n\n\u201cThe production forecast for white maize stands at roughly 7.7 million tonnes, while 6.9 million tonnes is expected for yellow maize this year.\n\n\u201cAlthough this year\u2019s total maize harvest is forecast to be 13% higher than last year\u2019s, thanks to better planting conditions this season, it is still below the five-year average of 15.3 million tonnes,\u201d Van der Linde stated.\n\nALSO READ: Food prices remain too high, here\u2019s what could go up further\n\nSA to remain a net exporter\n\nHe says the anticipated output will exceed the average annual maize consumption of roughly 11 million tonnes.\n\nConsequently, South Africa will remain a net exporter of maize in 2025.\n\n\u201cWhite maize is South Africa\u2019s foremost field crop, followed by wheat, soybeans, and sunflower seeds. It serves as a key staple food for much of the population, particularly poor households.\n\n\u201cMoreover, South Africa is a leading grain producer on the continent, and as the region\u2019s economic anchor, neighbouring countries also depend on food imports from the country,\u201d said Van der Linde.\n\nInflation\n\nHe adds that the inflation outlook for Southern African Customs Union (Sacu) countries is favourable, with headline rates within the South African Reserve Bank\u2019s generally recognised inflation target range of 3%-6%.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate that headline rates, including food price inflation, will rise gradually for Sacu countries over the coming months; however, this is of little concern given the low starting point for these countries.\u201d\n\nIn addition to higher crop output, lower annual fertiliser prices should help contain cost pressures while boosting the agricultural sector by improving the 2025 maize crop\u2019s profit margin prospect,\u201d Van der Linde concluded.\n\nNOW READ: Modest decline in essential food prices but savings not always passed on",

De Zorzi registered his ninth first-class century in 146 balls.\n\nHis 164-run second-wicket partnership with Eddie Moore helped set the stage for Verreynne to come in and play his natural game as Province piled on the runs.\n\nVerreynne scored an outstanding unbeaten 131 from 215 deliveries. The wicketkeeper faced 170 deliveries to reach his 14th first-class century.\n\nHe shared a pulsating 127-run fifth-wicket partnership with George Linde.\n\nVerreynne was content to play second fiddle to Linde's swashbuckling knock.\n\nWestern Province scored an outstanding 156 runs in a session and the majority of them were off Linde's bat.\n\nThe allrounder was dismissed for 91 off 66 balls in an innings that featured six fours and seven sixes.\n\nDROPPED ANCHOR\n\nBoland's batting line-up had contrasting fortunes in their reply.\n\nOnly two of their top seven batters went past 30 runs. Pieter Malan and Clyde Reeves-Fortuin batted out of their socks to put Boland in a position from where they could fight to avoid a loss.\n\nThey shared a match-saving 209-run fourth-wicket partnership.\n\nReeves-Fortuin faced 160 balls on his way to a third first-class century.\n\nThis is the Boland captain's first ton of the season. He has two fifties to go with the milestone.\n\nThe 29-year-old was dismissed for 129 off 214.\n\nMalan stayed true to his reputation of being a batter that digs in for a long innings.\n\nThe 35-year-old dropped anchor and patiently accumulated 102 runs from 246 deliveries.\n\nHe faced 243 deliveries to reach his 41st century.\n\nShaun von Berg had the best bowling figures in an innings and in the match with a five-wicket haul.\n\nThe seasoned campaigner took six wickets for 126 runs in 37 overs for Boland.\n\nMihlali Mpongwana and Jody Lawrence did well for Province, each with a four-wicket haul.\n\nMpongwana finished with four wickets for 57 runs in 21 overs and Lawrence took four for 58 in 16 overs.\n\nWESTERN PROVINCE: Tony de Zorzi, Daniel Smith, Eddie Moore, David Bedingham, Kyle Verreynne (capt)(wk), George Linde, Mihlali Mpongwana, Dane Paterson, Jody Lawrence, Mthiwekhaya Nabe, Wesley Bedja.\n\nBOLAND: Pieter Malan, Grant Roelofsen, Gavin Kaplan, Aviwe Mgijima, Clyde Reeves-Fortuin (capt)(wk), Shaun von Berg, Keith Dudgeon, Aya Gqamane, Ferisco Adams, Akhona Mnyaka, Glenton Stuurman.",

The Hungarian says, \u201cLet\u2019s relax and have a good time.\u201d After a few drinks, the Russian says, \u201cLet\u2019s get up, dance, and let ourselves go wild.\u201d After a few more drinks, the Polish Gypsy whips out her fiddle and begins sawing away while everyone in the room starts to whirl around to a mad Czardas. That might have been a description of Sunday afternoon\u2019s concert by four string players from the Boston Symphony except that the audience remained in their seats despite the musical incentives to do otherwise.\n\nErn\u00f6 von Dohnanyi (1877\u20131960) was the third and oldest member of a trio of eminent Hungarian composers of his generation whose careers straddled the 19th and 20th centuries, the others being Bela Bartok (1881\u20131945) and Zoltan Kodaly (1882\u20131967). Unlike them, he was not active as a folk-music scholar/collector and did not incorporate folk influence into his compositions to the same extent. He received praise from Brahms for an early effort (his Piano Quintet, op. 1), and he adhered to Central European late-Romantic style and harmonic language throughout his long life, during which he was better known as a virtuoso pianist than as a composer. As music director of the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra in the 1920s, Dohnanyi actively promoted the music of his two younger colleagues. Each of these composers exhibited an individual sense of humor: Bartok\u2019s biting and sardonic, Kodaly\u2019s hearty and down to Earth, and Dohnanyi\u2019s mellow and playful (his most famous piece is his 1914 \u201cVariations on a Nursery Rhyme\u201d for piano and orchestra, the tune in question being \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\u201d).\n\nDohnanyi\u2019s \u201cSerenade\u201d for string trio, which opened the program, was the composition that I most eagerly anticipated. Chamber music concerts can be brow-wrinkling affairs with string quartets (from Beethoven and later) that challenge the listener to explore profundities and unravel complexities. This is all very edifying, but it is nice even for music reviewers to take a holiday and allow themselves to be entertained in a relatively undemanding way, which is what the genre \u201cserenade\u201d is designed to do. The period from the late 18th to early 19th centuries was the heyday for serenades. At first the aristocracy commissioned them as party music from composers like Mozart (e.g., \u201cEine Kleine Nachtmusik\u201d); then publishers discovered a large middle-class market for sheet music and issued them by the boatload as \u201chouse music.\u201d Most of these were for smaller or larger chamber ensembles. The best-known serenades since the late 19th century were mostly for larger (professional) ensembles (e.g., Brahms, Dvorak, Elgar); they succeed very well in capturing the spirit of \u201cgem\u00fctlichkeit\u201d but were heard primarily in the concert hall. Chamber serenades persisted, as some composers took a break from exploring the profundities of human experience in their weightier symphonies, concertos, etc. One of my favorites is Schoenberg\u2019s \u201cSerenade\u201d from 1924, but its approach to entertainment is still of the \u201cwrinkled brow\u201d variety and certainly not for amateur players. On the other hand, Dohnanyi\u2019s \u201cSerenade\u201d from 1904 adheres to the most attractive and characteristic qualities of the genre, despite its late-Romantic harmonic vocabulary and absence of clich\u00e9s. It is for string trio and harks back to a similarly scored work by Beethoven, his \u201cSerenade,\u201d op. 8, published in 1797. Both Beethoven and Dohnanyi adopt a five-movement format, both opening with a March rather than a more portentious sonata-form movement. Both include richly lyrical adagios with plucked string accompaniments imitating the guitar being played beneath a balcony, as well as theme-and-variations movements. Beethoven throws in a folksy \u201cPolacca\u201d while Dohnanyi offers a scintillating \u201cScherzo\u201d full of diabolical contrapuntal and chromatic mischief. Each in its own way seeks to be entertaining and easy on the ears. In a clever touch, Dohnanyi\u2019s final Rondo fades out with the opening of the March (first movement) as a way of bringing the work around full circle. What is remarkable to me about Dohnanyi\u2019s work is that it uses the complex harmonic and textural resources of late Romanticism (it is, after all, post-Brahms and post-Wagner) but wears them very lightly. It finds a kind of ideal middle path between profundity and frivolity; it attains the Mozartian ideal of rewarding listeners on many levels.\n\nTo aficionado\u2019s of chamber music, Tchaikovsky\u2019s first string quartet is no rarity. The central theme of the Andante cantabile is almost one of classical music\u2019s greatest hits. The program notes for this concert point out that the composer had his feet in two different worlds: one in the Austro-German classical tradition and one in the Russian nationalist movement. The quartet is a well-crafted work, beautifully written for the strings, that observes classical decorum regarding form and variety of texture. The first movement opens with a throbbing chordal texture that conceals its metric underpinnings in a very effective way: It seems to be pulsing, but unsteadily, so that it takes a while to discover a pattern, which depends on recognizing a cross-rhythm. (The pattern is 2-3-2-1-1 adding up to nine beats; this will sound off-balance, even to those not trying to keep count). After 15 bars of this (by which time it has become predictable), the second violin begins a melodic pattern that betrays the underlying three-by-three meter more clearly, but 14 bars later, a bar of 12 (four by three) is thrown in to keep things off kilter. This may all refer to the unusual meters of some Russian and Slavic folk music that were later exploited by Stravinsky and Bartok. The quartet continues to display folk characteristics, in the modally inflected harmonies of the first movement, the use of a Ukrainian tune in the second, off-beat stamping rhythms with touches of pentatonic scales in the third, and a cheerful final movement that opens with a strong rhythmic motto (short-short-long) that eventually expands into an exhilarating, dancing finale. The string writing gives the performers every opportunity to shine; in this performance, the first violin (played by Bracha Malkin, who joined her colleagues as first violin) tended to protrude a bit too much, with a bright sound and a rapid vibrato that did not blend well with the rest of the group\u2019s more homogeneous sonority. At the same time, there was unanimity in pacing and mood that allowed the shape of the music to emerge in a way that sacrificed some decorum for the sake of excitement.\n\nIn a preview in The Berkshire Edge, my colleague David Edwards interviewed violinist Bonnie Bewick who supplied extensive information about her string quartet arrangement of \u201cPolonez\u201d which served as the closing tasty \u201cmorsel\u201d (as she described it from the stage) to this very listener-friendly program. Fitting into the Hungarian Rhapsody tradition, the work evolved from an improvisatory solo introduction (performed by Ms. Bewick) to a marked rhythmic pattern (long-short-short-long) familiar from the works of Liszt, Kodaly, Bartok, etc. This led to a headlong second movement loaded with high-energy dance rhythms. What only needs to be added is that the players dug into the skillfully crafted parts and virtuoso solos with relish, including moments where the players stamped in unison, obviously enjoying themselves as they hurtled forward to the frenzy of the final Czardas. At the conclusion, the audience stirred from their usual sedentary positions to one appropriate for a standing ovation. Non-alcoholic refreshments followed.",

The wicket though did not force the home side to alter their plans.\n\nThey had added 24 runs when they lost their second wicket 20 balls later.\n\nMoore and Bedingham consolidated with an unbroken 76-run third-wicket stand.\n\nThey were both going at a relatively brisk pace.

At stumps he had faced 96 deliveries for his unbeaten 55 runs.\n\nThis morning he needed a further 64 balls to reach his milestone. He scored a brilliant 129 from 214 balls.\n\nMalan scored a patient 102 from 246 deliveries. He faced 243 deliveries to reach his 41st century.\n\nUnfortunately for the visitors, Malan couldn't add more afterwards.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best ADR Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) stands against the other best ADR stocks.\n\nAmerican Depositary Receipts (ADR) are US-listed securities that represent shares in foreign companies, allowing American investors to gain exposure to international equities without dealing with foreign exchanges or currencies. Unlike regular shares of domestic companies, ADRs are issued by US banks and trade on American exchanges, typically in US dollars. While they provide easier access to foreign markets, ADRs can carry additional risks such as currency fluctuations, geopolitical factors, and differences in accounting standards or regulatory environments. Investors should also note that ADRs come in two forms: sponsored and unsponsored. Sponsored ADRs are issued in partnership with the foreign company and typically offer more reliable financial reporting and investor communication. Unsponsored ADRs, on the other hand, are created without the company\u2019s direct involvement and may have limited information available, making due diligence more challenging.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Worst ADR Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers\n\nADRs were not particularly popular in the last 15 years, as the US stock market has been the best-performing developed market since the 2008 financial crisis, significantly and consistently outperforming all major European markets as well as the Chinese stock market. The US stock market has massively benefited from the US\u2019s technological leadership and the emergence of tech giants with multi-trillion-dollar capitalizations, a more favorable business environment with lower tax rates, more aggressive financial stimulus, and, more importantly, significantly higher productivity growth vs. other regions. As a result, the US stock markets not only delivered higher earnings growth but also experienced the largest increase in valuations compared to Europe and China. The latter is partially attributed to foreign capital flowing into the US market as investors recognized the superior growth opportunities of US companies.\n\nThe recent political developments initiated by the Trump 2.0 regime have set the stage for a potential reversal of the aforementioned trends, which may drive relative outperformance of foreign markets and make ADRs attractive again. First, the Trump 2.0 tariff turmoil and massive cuts in federal spending are likely to cause an economic slowdown and thus cut the earnings growth potential of domestic companies. Second, the threat of tariffs imposed on the USA\u2019s allies is already causing retaliatory measures, including the potential substitution of American products for European or Canadian alternatives (again, this endangers the earnings growth potential of US domestic companies while boosting the potential of European and Canadian companies). Third, Europe has recognized that the US has become a less reliable partner, as evidenced by the major shift in policies of the new administration, and is already taking steps to ensure its independence and minimize dependence on the US. This is illustrated by the recent decision of Germany to create a \u20ac500 billion infrastructure fund to boost its defense capabilities (funds which are planned to be spent primarily on European contractors). Last but not least, the increasing tensions between the Western allies could potentially drive a return of European capital to the European continent, which may cause a relative valuation repricing in favor of the European stock market.",

Boland were on 159-3 at stumps.\n\nThe visitors trail Western Province by 433 runs with seven wickets in hand.\n\nThey had Pieter Malan (63*) and Clyde Reeves-Fortuin (55*) at the crease at the close of play.\n\nDane Paterson, Jody Lawrence and Mihlali Mpongwana handicapped Boland's reply to their first-innings total with three early wickets.\n\nPaterson delivered the first breakthrough four balls into Boland's innings with the dismissal of Grant Roelofsen for a three-ball duck.\n\nJody Lawrence made it 13-2 18 deliveries later.\n\nThe visitors attempted to rebuild with Malan and Aviwe Mgijima, but that effort only added 44 runs to their cause before Mpongwana struck.\n\nThe visitors needed a substantial partnership to stabilise the innings and they got it through Malan and Reeves-Fortuin's unbroken 102-run fourth-wicket partnership.\n\nMalan is renowned for his ability to knuckle down and bat a long innings. That is the mode he locked in.\n\nThe 35-year-old was unbeaten on 63 off 139 balls at stumps. This is his 57th first-class half-century and he faced 101 deliveries to reach the milestone.\n\nHis partner Reeves-Fortuin is enjoying a good run of form.\n\nThe Boland captain registered a half-century last week in Boland's rain-affected encounter against the DP World Lions.\n\nHe followed it up with another one against Western Province. The 29-year-old faced 74 deliveries to reach the landmark.\n\nReeves-Fortuin reached the landmark in style, creaming three consecutive boundaries off Dane Paterson to get there.\n\nHe was on 55 off 96 balls at the close of play.\n\nLINDE AND VERREYNNE ENTERTAIN\n\nEarlier in the day, George Linde and Kyle Verreynne put on a show as they batted Western Province to a total close to 600.\n\nVerreynne scored an outstanding unbeaten 131 from 215 deliveries as he shepherded Western Province to a total close to 600.\n\nThis is his second-highest score against Boland. The 27-year-old came into the match with 243 runs in two outings against their neighbours. One of the innings was an unbeaten 201.\n\nThe Western Province captain registered his second century against Boland during a dominant 127-run fifth-wicket partnership he shared with Linde.\n\nThis is now the highest fifth-wicket stand record for Western Province in the format.\n\nVerreynne faced 170 deliveries to reach his 14th first-class century.\n\nVerreynne was content to play second fiddle to Linde's swashbuckling knock.\n\nWestern Province scored an outstanding 156 runs in the session and the majority of them were off Linde's bat.\n\nLinde was dismissed for 91 off 66 balls. This isn't the first time Linde has starred with the bat for his side.\n\nHe scored an outstanding 152 to bail Western Province out of a tight spot when they went up against the Dafabet Warriors.\n\nOnly one of his team's top order got going in that match. Five of them fell for single-digit scores.\n\nThe allrounder walked out to bat under different circumstances this time around. Only Daniel Smith was unable to reach a milestone, while the rest cashed in.\n\nThere were drooping shoulders and weary legs in the visitors' team during Boland's innings.\n\nOnly one Boland player stood out.\n\nShaun von Berg kept Boland afloat with his 29th five-wicket haul, his second five-wicket haul of the season.\n\nThe spinner bagged 8-54 in Boland's season opener against the Dafabet Warriors.\n\nHe finished the innings with six wickets for 126 runs in 37 overs.\n\nWESTERN PROVINCE: Tony de Zorzi, Daniel Smith, Eddie Moore, David Bedingham, Kyle Verreynne (capt)(wk), George Linde, Mihlali Mpongwana, Dane Paterson, Jody Lawrence, Mthiwekhaya Nabe, Wesley Bedja.\n\nBOLAND: Pieter Malan, Grant Roelofsen, Gavin Kaplan, Aviwe Mgijima, Clyde Reeves-Fortuin (capt)(wk), Shaun von Berg, Keith Dudgeon, Aya Gqamane, Ferisco Adams, Akhona Mnyaka, Glenton Stuurman.",

Thanks to everyone who worked hard over the winter to get us into this good starting position for the season.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsidering where we started and where we finished the race, nobody would have predicted or expected that!\u201d added Farfus. \u201cIt shows what a great team we have behind us and what a strong driver line-up, as we executed it perfectly. Taking home a podium felt like a win, and gives us great hope that we can maintain this momentum.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the next round of the campaign \u2013 the 6 Hours of Imola \u2013 holds happy memories for BMW, after the brand claimed a milestone one-two finish in Italy last year, the #31 leading the #46 to the chequered flag.\n\nThe Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari is also home soil for Valentino Rossi, although the multiple motorcycling world champion together with team-mates Ahmad Al Harthy and Kelvin van der Linde endured a tough time of things in Qatar. The trio\u2019s solid turn-of-speed was undone by a brace of penalties for track limits violations that restricted the Team WRT crew to 11th place, just one spot shy of the points-paying positions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we finished the race outside of the top ten,\u201d rued recently-appointed BMW M works driver, van der Linde. \u201cWe have so much potential within the team and our driver line-up, but for some reason, we didn\u2019t have the same pace as our sister car. The team will investigate this and we also need to put the penalties behind us. We need to deal with it, shake off the result and look forward.\u201d",

            "content": "With a market cap of $8.8 billion, Albemarle Corporation ALB is a leading global specialty chemicals company with strong positions in key markets such as energy storage, consumer electronics, and automotive. The company operates through three segments: Energy Storage, Specialties, and Ketjen, providing advanced lithium, bromine, and catalyst solutions.\n\nCompanies worth less than $10 billion are generally described as \u201cmid-cap\u201d stocks, and Albemarle fits this criterion perfectly. Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, its products support critical applications, including lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, fire safety compounds, and clean fuel technologies.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nHowever, the specialty chemicals company pulled back 45.6% from its 52-week high of $137.50. Shares of ALB have declined 15.3% over the past three months, lagging behind the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund's XLB 2% rise over the same time frame.\n\nLonger term, ALB stock is down 13.2% on a YTD basis, underperforming XLB\u2019s nearly 3% gain. In addition, shares of Albemarle have dipped nearly 42% over the past 52 weeks, compared to XLB\u2019s 6.5% drop over the same time frame.\n\nALB stock has been trading mostly below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages since last year.\n\nDespite reporting a weaker-than-expected Q4 2024 adjusted loss of $1.09 per share and revenue of $1.2 billion, Albemarle's shares rose 3.5% the next day due to optimism around its aggressive cost-cutting measures. Investors responded positively to the company's plans to cut its 2025 capital expenditures to $700 million - $800 million, roughly half of 2024\u2019s budget. Additionally, the company posted a GAAP profit of $33.6 million, a sharp turnaround from the prior year\u2019s $617.7 million loss, which reassured investors despite weak lithium prices.\n\nNevertheless, in comparison, rival Linde plc LIN has significantly outperformed ALB. Linde's shares have declined marginally over the past 52 weeks and returned 11% on a YTD basis.\n\nDespite Albemarle\u2019s weak performance, analysts are moderately optimistic about its prospects. The 25 analysts covering the stock have a consensus rating of \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and as of writing, it is trading below the mean price target of $99.80.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sohini Mondal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

            "content": "Valentino Rossi has set himself the target of improving his qualifying pace enough to score a first pole in the FIA World Endurance Championship this season.\n\nThe nine-time motorcycle racing world champion is embarking on his fourth season in car racing with Team WRT this year, and his second in the WEC, sharing the No. 46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO with Kelvin van der Linde and Ahmad Al Harthy.\n\nLast month\u2019s Qatar 1812km afforded Rossi the first chance to participate in qualifying in the WEC since he joined the championship, courtesy of a rule change that means Silver-rated drivers now have to drive in Hyperpole.\n\nBronze-rated Al Harthy qualified sixth in the first segment of LMGT3 qualifying to afford Rossi his first Hyperpole shot, with the Italian going on to secure eighth on the grid, 0.750 seconds off the pace of poleman Sean Gelael.\n\n\u201cI like it very much,\u201d said Rossi of the new rule. \u201cIf not, Saturday was very long, maybe we would do three laps in the morning, and then nothing. So this is better.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting, you have to give the maximum concentration, it\u2019s very demanding, the car is light. It\u2019s fun to drive.\n\n\u201cAlso because, sincerely, the qualifying lap is not my strong point, so to have the chance to improve on this, for me it\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nAsked if he felt he could fight for a pole this year, Rossi replied: \u201cExactly, this is the target, because when you go to other races, you have to make the qualifying.\n\n\u201cHopefully the fans in Imola will see me in Hyperpole!\u201d\n\nRossi Says Schedule Makes Suzuka 1000km Appearance \u201cDifficult\u201d\n\nAfter taking on a double program with BMW and WRT last year across the WEC and GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, Rossi has scaled back his activities for this year to focus mainly on the former category.\n\nHowever, the 46-year-old contested the Meguiar\u2019s Bathurst 12 Hour round of the Intercontinental GT Challenge last month, and has previously confirmed that he plans to make a fourth appearance in the CrowdStrike 24 Hours of Spa, and an additional appearance in the Sprint Cup leg of the GTWC Europe at his home venue at Misano.\n\nAsked whether he could consider adding the revived Suzuka 1000km round of the Intercontinental GT Challenge to his schedule, Rossi said that its positioning between the Circuit of The Americas and Fuji WEC rounds on the calendar makes it impractical.\n\n\u201cI think this year it will be difficult because in the calendar it\u2019s between two WEC races,\u201d said Rossi, who won the Suzuka 8 Hour two-wheel endurance race in 2001 and last raced at the famous figure-of-eight track in MotoGP in 2003.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s two weeks before Fuji, so it will be difficult. You have to go to Suzuka and then either stay around, or go back and forth.\n\n\u201cMaybe this year it\u2019s tricky, but I want to drive this car at Suzuka [in the future] because the track is one of the best.\u201d",

His inclusion strengthens Peshawar Zalmi\u2019s squad as they aim to improve on their performance from last season. Fans are eager to see how Linde will contribute to the team\u2019s campaign in what promises to be a fiercely competitive tournament.\n\nAlso READ: Fans slam PSL franchise Multan Sultans for taking a jibe at Indian captain Rohit Sharma\n\nKarachi Kings appoint a new captain for the upcoming season\n\nIn a bold move, Karachi Kings have named Australian cricketing superstar David Warner as their captain for PSL 2025. Warner was acquired for a record-breaking USD 300,000 during the draft, making headlines even before stepping onto the field.\n\nWarner\u2019s appointment marks his debut in the PSL, and he expressed enthusiasm about leading Karachi Kings in one of the world\u2019s most popular T20 leagues. Known for his aggressive batting style and proven leadership skills, Warner brings a wealth of experience from international cricket and various franchise leagues.\n\nAs PSL 2025 approaches, these developments promise thrilling action and new dynamics for fans to look forward to. Both Peshawar Zalmi and Karachi Kings are gearing up for an exciting campaign, setting the stage for another memorable season of Pakistan\u2019s premier T20 league.",

This collaboration is expected to significantly reduce both fuel consumption and fuel-based Scope 1 carbon dioxide emissions for O-I, a global leader in glass manufacturing.\n\nLinde offers a broad range of technologies, including the patented OPTIMELTTM TCR technology, to help glass manufacturers increase the energy efficiency of their melting operations. This unique technology recovers waste heat from glass furnace flue gas to preheat and reform the natural gas feed.

The OPTIMELTTM TCR technology is also compatible with a range of fuels such as low carbon hydrogen or blends of hydrogen and natural gas. Linde\u2019s OPTIMELTTM TCR technology is being implemented by glass manufacturing customers worldwide, including in the United States.\n\n\u201cLinde has provided innovative oxygen and burner technology to the glass industry for more than three decades.

In addition to supporting O-I\u2019s objectives, this will help our customers in their own decarbonization efforts\u201d.\n\nIn addition, O-I has commissioned Linde to install an advanced Centrifugal VITRON\u00ae Vacuum Pressure Swing Adsorption (VPSA) plant at the Holzminden plant to produce a steady supply of oxygen for the furnace. As part of Linde\u2019s ECOVAR\u00ae small on-site portfolio, the VITRON\u00ae plant incorporates the latest proprietary Linde technology to significantly improve power efficiency, lower noise emissions, and further reduce the environmental footprint for O-I and for multiple global customers in the glass industry.\n\nAbout O-I GLASS\n\nAt O-I Glass, Inc.

It faced tough competition from both domestic and Chinese players. The country has also witnessed a severe headwind in shipbuilding, infrastructure and real estate projects, which resulted in subdued demand for welding electrodes.\n\nLinde did good business in 2021, particularly in the medical segment, as the need for medical oxygen shot up for Covid patients dealing with breathing distress in hospitals.\n\nAs the pandemic waned and raw material prices skyrocketed due to the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, revenue from the segment kept falling.\n\nSubsequently, Linde saw a six-year low profit of Tk 883 million in 2022. The shrinking profit compelled the company to cut down annual cash dividends to 420 per cent for 2022 from 550 per cent paid for 2021.\n\nThe decline in profit continued in 2023, leading to a 40 per cent less income year-on-year to Tk 525.68 million in 2023.\n\nA member of Linde, a global leader in industrial gases, Linde Bangladesh has been operating for over 70 years in Bangladesh, serving sectors from healthcare to manufacturing through its extensive production facilities and market presence.\n\nbabulfexpress@gmail.com",

We can see that Linde India Limited ( ) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\n\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is Linde India's Debt?\n\nAs you can see below, at the end of September 2024, Linde India had \u20b9424.8m of debt, up from \u20b9216.0m a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it does have \u20b99.98b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of \u20b99.56b.\n\nHow Strong Is Linde India's Balance Sheet?\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Linde India had liabilities of \u20b910.5b due within a year, and liabilities of \u20b92.98b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of \u20b99.98b as well as receivables valued at \u20b94.06b due within 12 months. So it actually has \u20b9546.8m more liquid assets than total liabilities.\n\nHaving regard to Linde India's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So while it's hard to imagine that the \u20b9551.9b company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. Simply put, the fact that Linde India has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.\n\nFortunately, Linde India grew its EBIT by 6.7% in the last year, making that debt load look even more manageable. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Linde India can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free .\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. While Linde India has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Looking at the most recent three years, Linde India recorded free cash flow of 23% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect. That's not great, when it comes to paying down debt.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Linde India has \u20b99.56b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. On top of that, it increased its EBIT by 6.7% in the last twelve months. So we don't have any problem with Linde India's use of debt. Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all. If you've also come to that realization, you're in luck, because today you can for free.\n\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out without delay.\n\nNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts Our new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities. \u2022 Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n\n\u2022 Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n\n\u2022 High growth Tech and AI Companies\n\n\n\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.

            "content": "Lenox \u2014 At the 67th GRAMMY Awards in February, the Akropolis Reed Quintet became the first group of its kind to win a GRAMMY. Their single \u201cStrands,\u201d from the album \u201cAre We Dreaming the Same Dream?,\u201d earned recognition from the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences in the category of Best Instrumental Composition. The ensemble will appear at Tanglewood\u2019s Linde Center for Music and Learning on Sunday, March 29.\n\nBut what kind of group is Akropolis? Plenty of ensembles claim to be unbounded by category, and many of them truly are. But Akropolis is unconstrained by genre, convention, or tradition. Still, they self-identify as a \u201cclassical chamber music\u201d group.\n\nI spoke with Akropolis clarinetist Kari Landry last month by telephone. We talked about the group\u2019s recent GRAMMY win and their program for the 29th, which includes some of the most popular pieces they have commissioned. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nI want to start with your recent GRAMMY win.\n\nAll right.\n\nYou probably don\u2019t mind talking about that.\n\nNo! Absolutely!\n\nHow does that win differentiate you from other classical music ensembles?\n\nIt was obviously this massive thing for us. We were so, so proud of the album and that project with composer Pascal Le Boeuf and drummer Christian Euman. And to be recognized\u2014not just in the classical chamber music field for this but the music and recording industry at large\u2014is a massive honor and accomplishment for us and, I think, a great testament to just how incredible Pascal\u2019s music is, but also how I think it really connects with the wider music-listening audience.\n\nAnd so, for us as this atypical reed quintet instrumentation, it\u2019s just massively affirming and we\u2019re very grateful that people have been so supportive of us. So it\u2019s a huge bump for us\u2014I think it\u2019ll be especially a massive bump for wind players, for reed players out there to see that you can do something on your own and form something that may not be a traditional instrumentation, but still be able to make and perform and record and share music at the absolute highest level. So I think that we\u2019re not only seeing an immediate bump from it, but I really hope it will have a ripple effect across the industry at large.\n\nWell, clearly this is not the first time your group has received such broad recognition. You\u2019ve had three albums that charted on Billboard.\n\nRight, yeah.\n\nSo how does that differentiate you from other groups?\n\nWell, for us, I think we\u2019ve always wanted to make music that really directly connects with people but also reflects our community and tries to meet people where they\u2019re at but also tell stories of what\u2019s happening today. And I think through our commissioning and the fact that we\u2019re this new instrumentation, I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re able to achieve that\u2014because we work with people who are alive and have lived experiences that are happening right now. And so I think that automatically connects with people and audiences who are hungry for these stories of today to be told.\n\nWe\u2019ve been able to cut through a lot of the noise in the industry because our music is something that people can latch onto, not only emotionally, but sonically. We\u2019re always trying to find an accessible sound with our chamber music and to showcase these instruments in a way that really connects with people. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to have such a wonderful fan base of people who have always loved listening to us and have supported us.\n\nIt sounds like you must commission works from composers who also are interested in making music that\u2019s accessible to broad audiences. Is that fair to say?\n\nYeah. That\u2019s something we are drawn to in composers that we work with. And I think that, just in general, we also try to work with many different kinds of composers from many different lived experiences, so that we can create things that connect with a variety of people in communities. We\u2019ve created 200-plus commissions now, and with every single one, we continue to push ourselves as to what the sound of the Reed Quintet can be and what chamber music can be. That expands who you can reach with your music as well.\n\nSo how have you involved small business owners in the creation of new music?\n\nThat was a really amazing project that we did on our last album, the album before this GRAMMY-winning album. The album was called \u201cHymns for Private Use,\u201d and it had two pieces on it, one by Nico Muhly that we teamed up with soprano Shara Nova to make this amazing piece. And then the second track on that album was this massive work by composer Annika Socolofsky, where we decided that we wanted to somehow incorporate the story of small businesses into the music. And we decided to do this by selecting seven small businesses that we had either community or personal connections to. We then did many hours of interviews with these small business owners. And then Annika, the composer, wove together this amazing tapestry for us to perform alongside. And so the whole piece is roughly 20 minutes, and it\u2019s basically this through story and conversation that you get with these seven small business owners sharing their stories.\n\nIt\u2019s surprising how many connection points and strands that everybody shares in having a small business and what it means to have their community behind them. And this was just a great way for us to really connect with our community in a way where we could have them directly involved in the music making. We got to premiere and perform these pieces directly in some of the businesses where we had concerts, and that was really moving. Then we got to work with a filmmaker to make this wonderful documentary that shared the visual stories of all of these business owners. And so it was just a very wonderful creative project that had such a great message behind it of the impact that small businesses have on all of us. And Akropolis also really connects to that because we\u2019re a small business ourselves and it\u2019s very much an enterprise for us. So it was a wonderful story that we loved being able to tell.\n\nIs there anything in the standard repertory that\u2019s scored for your combination of instruments?\n\nSure. There\u2019s actually a wealth of arrangements that have been done either by other arrangers and reed quintets out there in the world, or there\u2019s been several arrangements that we\u2019ve done ourselves or had commissioned for ourselves. And so we have a fabulous arrangement of George Gershwin\u2019s \u201cAn American in Paris\u201d that we play quite a lot. And Ravel\u2019s \u201cLe Tombeau de Couperin,\u201d and several Rameau harpsichord suites work tremendously for the Reed Quintet.\n\nI think when we approach more traditional repertoire and arrangements, we look for shared bits of DNA in either what the composers value or what kind of energy and kinetic force the pieces have. We have a deep love for how we can combine the very classical traditions and rigorous training of our instruments and showcase that in just the highest level we possibly can and bring a lot of older sounds to new life as well. It\u2019s an important part of what we do.\n\nHow does the instrumentation change from piece to piece? Do you double on instruments and change that up?\n\nOccasionally. Our oboe player, Tim, he\u2019ll play English horn on several pieces. I believe on the concert at Tanglewood, he\u2019ll be playing English horn on the Nina Simone tune \u201cFor All We Know.\u201d And then Matt Landry, our saxophonist, he\u2019ll play both alto and soprano saxophone, and everybody will hear both those saxophones at the concert. And then as far as the bassoon and bass clarinet, those two pretty much stick to the bassoon and bass clarinet. And then myself on B-flat clarinet, I\u2019ll play both B-flat and A clarinet a lot at both concerts. So at any given point, you\u2019ll see several other instruments up on the stage.\n\nDo you play jazz transcriptions?\n\nOccasionally, we do\u2014specifically for the project that won the GRAMMY with Pascal Le Boeuf and Christian Euman, we have that album as a touring program that we play with the seven of us. And on that touring program, we\u2019ll play a few jazz charts that have been arranged for the seven of us. And in addition to that, we\u2019ll play some other pieces that Pascal was influenced by when writing \u201cAre We Dreaming The Same Dream?,\u201d like Gershwin\u2019s \u201cAn American in Paris.\u201d So we have a few little things that we pepper in, but that\u2019s very specific to that program because that program is really a classical-jazz crossover program, and Pascal and Christian are primarily jazz artists. But on the average Akropolis concert, you will not hear a jazz chart.\n\nCan you give us an idea of what you\u2019re actually going to have on your program on the 29th?\n\nYes. We\u2019re starting the concert with one of our absolute favorite pieces for Reed Quintet that\u2019s really become a staple way of how we introduce ourselves to new audiences. It\u2019s called \u201cSplinter,\u201d and it\u2019s by a Chicago-based composer named Marc Melitz. And the piece is inspired by minimalism, but also rock and roll. It\u2019s very groovy, very rhythmic, and we find it\u2019s often one of the best ways we can introduce ourselves to a new audience through this piece of music. It\u2019s one of our all-time favorites, and we\u2019ve been playing it for many years.\n\nAfter that, we\u2019re playing a relatively new work that we commissioned by LA composer Derrick Skye. And this piece was made possible thanks to a large grant from Chamber Music America. Chamber Music America has this wonderful classical commissioning program that is very competitive to get, but if you do receive one of these grants, it helps you create a new masterwork for your instrumentation.\n\nAnd so we were really fortunate to be awarded one of these with Derrick. It\u2019s really quite a lengthy piece\u2014about 20 minutes\u2014and it\u2019s called \u201cA Soulful Nexus.\u201d And it has two main influences to it really, because these are Derrick\u2019s primary influences and what he\u2019s most talented in as a composer. The first is Persian classical music, and this is Derrick\u2019s training and his background and his DNA as an artist. So the piece has a lot of direct Persian classical music woven throughout it. And when we give the concert, we\u2019ll share with the audience everything that goes into Persian classical music, but essentially it\u2019s a different scalar system. So you\u2019ll hear notes in between notes that are woven throughout the piece and some improvisatory elements that are written out for us but are meant to sound improvisatory, alluding more to the style of Persian classical music.\n\nAnd Derrick\u2019s hope in using this language alongside something that might be more familiar is that by the end of the piece, these notes between notes are just as beautiful, if not accepted by the audience at large. And the piece is just stunning. And the other main influence in \u201cA Soulful Nexus\u201d is electronic dance music. So it has really a lot of grooves to it. It\u2019s very, very catchy with how he weaves these two elements together. And that\u2019s why it is a nexus of these two styles coming together, which is just Derrick\u2019s personality and training in a nutshell. We premiered the piece last fall, and it\u2019s been on almost every single concert we\u2019ve given ever since, because it\u2019s just so cool and groovy and truly unique. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything else in our repertoire that sounds quite like it. And audiences, I think, haven\u2019t heard anything like it quite yet, which is what also makes it really special.\n\nAnd then after that, we\u2019re playing a transcription of a song made famous by Nina Simone. It\u2019s called, \u201cFor All We Know.\u201d It\u2019s a beautiful little tune that really features Matt Landry on saxophone doing the vocals that Nina sang. And that piece is a very touching tune, where it alludes to living in the moment, cherishing each day, because for all we know, tomorrow may never come. It\u2019s a beautiful track that we love to highlight on our concerts.\n\nAnd then the concert is closing with another big commission that we did a few years back by French hornist and composer Jeff Scott. Jeff is a dear friend of ours, and we asked him to write a piece that was about our hometown of Detroit, Mich. And we brought Jeff out and showed him around the city and took him to the Charles H. Wright Museum of African-American History. And he was immediately struck by this story in Detroit of these neighborhoods called Paradise Valley and Black Bottom, that in the 1940s, through \u201950s roughly, were razed or demolished, and they don\u2019t exist anymore.\n\nJeff grew up in Harlem and a very similar thing happened to his neighborhood and where he grew up. So he wanted to help shine a light on all the wonderful arts and culture and communities and businesses and people that existed that really don\u2019t exist anymore.\n\nIf you come to Detroit, there are highways now where all these businesses and clubs and venues and thoroughfares used to be. So the piece directly pays homage to this culture, and it\u2019s become just an amazingly popular work, especially among reed quintets over the last several years. We recorded it on our \u201cGhost Light\u201d album, along with poetry by Detroit author and historian Marsha Music, who grew up in these neighborhoods and experienced what happened to them firsthand. And so it\u2019s just a wonderful piece to close the concert. The final movement is really inspired by \u201cJump Jazz,\u201d which was performed in the Paradise Theater in Detroit at the time, and it\u2019s just a massive celebration of that music in that era. And so it\u2019s one of our favorite ways to close the show. And that\u2019s everything that we\u2019re playing.\n\nI know you get submissions from all over the world. Are Berkshire Edge readers free to submit new works to your group?\n\nYeah. Because we\u2019re a reed quintet, we often have a lot of people that send us music and share ideas with us. And I think that because our ensemble is living and our repertoire is living, we always welcome people sharing their thoughts and ideas with us, because the ensemble type has not been around for that long, and so it\u2019s up to all of us to shape it right now, which I think is super, super cool. So yeah, if people want to send stuff our way, feel free.\n\n* * *\n\nHear the Akropolis Reed Quintet at Tanglewood\u2019s Linde Center for Music and Learning on Saturday, March 29, 7 p.m. Tickets and more information are available here.",

            "content": "Pakistan have this habit of losing the first game of the series. They lost the first game in the Australia and Zimbabwe ODIs before coming back strongly to clinch the series. They will have to do something similar here if they are to win the series. That's all from this game. The next one is on Friday from the Centurion. Do join us for that. Until next time, goodbye and stay safe..\n\nHeinrich Klaasen | South Africa captain: I wouldn't say it was a great performance but a couple of guys stepped up. There are small margins in cricket, pleased we didn't bomb up after losing wickets early. Those three youngsters Peter, Maphaka and Simelane.. along with Georgy (Linde) had a great game. He (Miller) had a fantastic game. He has been working really hard and may it continue for long. Looking forward to all five games.\n\nMohammad Rizwan | Pakistan captain: Lot of positives. The innings from Miller and Linde took the momentum away from us. The counterattack from Miller took the momentum as we had started well by picking early wickets. The spinners bowled very well, they used the pitch and conditions well. There are a lot of positives and hopefully we do well in the next match.\n\nGeorge Linde | Player of the Match: Almost a perfect comeback game apart from the hat-trick ball. I have played quite a lot of cricket, have had a pretty good season so far, tried to keep calm and ask myself what the team needs. When he gave it out I was surprised but told the boys it was going down leg (hat-trick ball). I felt calm today for some reason. I missed the bus while coming to the ground, I thought I had to deliver and glad I did. The police escorted me to the ground.\n\n22:04 Local Time, 20:04 GMT, 01:34 IST: Rizwan might have scored 74 but that was an ordinary innings from the Pakistan captain. He got stuck at one end and struggled to get going - he went at less than a run-a-ball until he reached his fifty and only caught towards the end. His knock put pressure on the others as they had to find the boundary and they perished while doing so. Rizwan did keep Pakistan alive when he got 24 runs off the 17th over but a triple wicket over from Linde killed the contest for the visitors. Early on, David Miller put on a show as he smashed a 40-ball 82 and George Linde, who finished with 4/21 with the ball, also had a say with the bat as his 24-ball 48 is what took South Africa past the 180-mark. Presentations coming up..\n\n19.6 Kwena Maphaka to Haris Rauf, 1 run, South Africa win by 11 runs. Maphaka does a fine job in the final over. Full delivery angled across, Rauf drives it towards extra cover and crosses over\n\n19.5 Kwena Maphaka to Sufiyan Muqeem, 1 run, makes room and Maphaka follows him with a full delivery, flicked through mid-wicket\n\n19.4 Kwena Maphaka to Sufiyan Muqeem, 2 runs, backs away and Maphaka follows him with a slower ball, chips it over mid-on and that's couple more\n\n19.3 Kwena Maphaka to Sufiyan Muqeem, 2 runs, fullish delivery outside off, Muqeem slices it over backward point and the sweeper tidies up, just a brace\n\nSufiyan Muqeem, left handed bat, comes to the crease\n\n19.2 Kwena Maphaka to Rizwan, out Caught by Nqabayomzi Peter!! The youngster wins the battle of nerves against the veteran. He might have also sealed the game. Klaasen is thrilled as he fist pumps. Slower short of length delivery, the angle was going across him and Rizwan tried to pull against the angle, gets a thick top-edge and the ball goes straight up, Peter settles under it near short third and hangs on. Rizwan c Nqabayomzi Peter b Kwena Maphaka 74(62) [4s-5 6s-3]\n\nKwena Maphaka to Rizwan, THATS OUT!! Caught!!\n\n19.1 Kwena Maphaka to Haris Rauf, 1 run, full delivery on leg, Rauf drives to long-on and gets Rizwan on strike. 18 off 5..\n\nKwena Maphaka [3.0-0-32-1] is back into the attack\n\n19 needed off the final over. Young Maphaka has been given the responsibility. Rauf will have to get Rizwan on strike off the first ball.\n\n18.6 Ottneil Baartman to Rizwan, FOUR, finds the boundary. Another short of length delivery, sits up nicely for Rizwan to play the pull, he fetches it from outside off and nails it between deep mid-wicket and long-on\n\n18.5 Ottneil Baartman to Rizwan, FOUR, Baartman misses the yorker and feeds it in the slot, Rizwan pumps it straight down the ground and beats the dive from the long-on fielder. Will he take a single or look for a four/six off the final ball?\n\n18.4 Ottneil Baartman to Rizwan, no run, full pitcher outside off, Rizwan drills it hard and straight to long-off\n\n18.3 Ottneil Baartman to Rizwan, FOUR, Rizwan has taken it upon himself to win the game for Pakistan. Picks the short of length delivery, pulls it in front of square and almost gets it all the way, one bounce and over the ropes",

            "content": "The hydrogen infrastructure market faces environmental challenges despite its potential for clean energy transition. Green hydrogen production requires vast renewable energy resources, while blue hydrogen relies on carbon capture, which may not be entirely efficient. Hydrogen leakage during storage and transport can impact atmospheric chemistry, contributing to indirect warming. Additionally, water-intensive electrolysis raises sustainability concerns in water-scarce regions. Material and energy demand for pipeline construction and fuel cell production also pose environmental risks. Addressing these issues through technological advancements, sustainable resource management, and regulatory frameworks is crucial to ensuring hydrogen\u2019s role as a truly sustainable energy solution.\n\nRising global energy demands, driven by population growth, economic expansion, and urbanization, underscore the need for cleaner alternatives. With fossil fuels accounting for 80% of energy consumption, hydrogen is poised to play a crucial role in decarbonization by replacing fossil fuel-based hydrogen in refining and serving as a cleaner fuel for transportation and power generation. Governments are actively promoting hydrogen infrastructure, as seen in India's National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM). Launched in November 2024, the MNRE's R&D scheme supports indigenous technology development, fostering efficient production, storage, and utilization of green hydrogen, driving market growth during the forecast period.\n\nThe global Hydrogen Infrastructure Market is set for considerable expansion from 2024 to 2032. Hydrogen infrastructure includes production, storage, distribution, and refueling, involving governments, producers, pipeline companies, and distributors. Optimizing logistics is key for efficiency. With global hydrogen demand exceeding 97 Mt in 2023 and projected to reach 100 Mt in 2024, expanding storage, transportation, and refueling networks is essential for sustainable energy growth.\n\nDublin, March 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Introspective Market Research is pleased to announce the publication of its latest report, Hydrogen Infrastructure Market. This in-depth analysis shows that the Global Hydrogen Infrastructure Market , valued at USD 5.39 Billion in 2023, is set for substantial growth and is projected to reach USD 12.76 Billion by 2032 . This anticipated expansion reflects a strong compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.05% from 2024 to 2032.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOpportunity\n\nRise in Government Policies Create Opportunity for Hydrogen Infrastructure\n\nGovernment policies are driving growth in the hydrogen infrastructure market by supporting production, storage, and distribution. Many countries have launched hydrogen roadmaps, subsidies, and funding initiatives to accelerate adoption. For instance, India's National Green Hydrogen Mission promotes R&D and indigenous technology development, while the EU and U.S. offer incentives for hydrogen projects. Policies encouraging carbon reduction, clean energy investments, and public-private partnerships are fostering market expansion. Mandates for industrial decarbonization and hydrogen-powered transportation are creating demand. As governments worldwide prioritize clean energy, these policies will unlock opportunities, attracting investments and accelerating the transition to a hydrogen-based economy.\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\nHigh Costs Hinder Hydrogen Infrastructure Growth as a Clean Energy Source\n\nThe high initial cost of hydrogen infrastructure remains a major barrier to market growth and adoption. While hydrogen holds promise as a clean energy source, its economic challenges hinder large-scale expansion. Production costs are a key concern, with steam methane reforming (SMR) and electrolysis being the primary methods. SMR, the most cost-effective option, relies on natural gas and emits carbon dioxide, limiting sustainability. Electrolysis, though cleaner, requires significant electricity, making it expensive. These financial and environmental challenges slow the development of a hydrogen economy. Advancements in technology and government incentives are crucial to overcoming cost barriers and fostering adoption.\n\n\n\nKey Players to Watch:\n\nACWA Power (Saudi Arabia)\n\nAir Liquide (France)\n\nAir Products and Chemicals (United States)\n\nBP (United Kingdom)\n\nENGIE (France)\n\nENGIE Solutions (France)\n\nEquinor (Norway)\n\nIberdrola (Spain)\n\nLinde (United Kingdom)\n\nMAN, Energy Solutions (Germany)\n\nMitsubishi Power (Japan)\n\nNEL Hydrogen (Norway)\n\nPlug Power (United States)\n\nRepsol (Spain)\n\nShell (Netherlands)\n\nSiemens Energy (Germany)\n\nThyssenkrupp (Germany)\n\nTotalEnergies (France)\n\nWoodside Energy (Australia)\n\nOther Active Players\n\nWant exclusive data insights on Hydrogen Infrastructure Market Make an Inquiry now>> https://introspectivemarketresearch.com/inquiry/18790\n\nRecent Development\n\nIn December 2024 , JCB, HYCAP, and HydraB Group collaborated to launch HYKIT, a joint venture dedicated to advancing hydrogen infrastructure.

            "content": "Image: Linde\n\nInterCentral Logistics has strengthened its operations at its Cranbourne West site with the addition of five new Linde reach trucks.\n\nAs a high-volume third-party logistics (3PL) provider, InterCentral Logistics relies on precision and efficiency in its warehouse operations. The decision to integrate Linde\u2019s equipment into its fleet was driven by its need for high-reaching, reliable forklifts to support daily pallet movements and improve operational safety.\n\nAshley Roberts, Warehouse Manager at InterCentral Logistics, highlighted the key factors behind their choice.\n\n\u201cOur journey with Linde started when we needed forklifts that could reach up to 10.5 metres.\u201d\n\nAfter researching and trialling the equipment, and following a recommendation from Linde Victorian Territory Manager, Mia Whiteoak, it was clear that Linde could provide the quality and reliability they were after.\n\nOperating across four warehouses in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, InterCentral Logistics required equipment that could seamlessly integrate into its existing infrastructure. The Cranbourne West facility features tall racking, demanding precision in storage and retrieval tasks.\n\n\u201cWe move around 200-250 pallets daily, so having equipment that operates smoothly in our environment is crucial,\u201d Ashley explained. \u201cLinde\u2019s reach trucks have proven to be incredibly reliable and well-suited for our workload.\u201d\n\nTo meet these needs, the company added five Linde R16HD Series 115 Reach Trucks into its fleet.\n\nSafety and operational efficiency were also key considerations in the decision-making process. Each reach truck is equipped with the Linde BlueSpot safety light, a digital weight indicator, and an aftermarket CCTV camera fitted locally.\n\nAshley noted the impact these features have had on their operations. \u201cThe safety cameras have been very beneficial to our operations. They guide our staff by providing a clear view of where the tynes are positioned when moving pallets at height, eliminating guesswork and reducing strain on our operators. Previously, our forklifts didn\u2019t have cameras. This addition has made a difference in both precision and efficiency for InterCentral Logistics\u2019 racking operations.\n\nThe Linde BlueSpot safety light has also improved pedestrian awareness in the warehouse.\n\n\u201cThe BlueSpot light is great for ensuring there are no pedestrians within three metres of the truck, helping us maintain OH&S compliance.\u201d\n\nThe transition to Linde\u2019s equipment was smooth, thanks to the dedicated support from Linde\u2019s team. \u201cMia and the Linde team made the buying process easy,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cWe needed some modifications on a few units, and Linde handled it without any issue. It\u2019s been very easy for us.\u201d\n\nMia Whiteoak shares insights into the collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe encouraged a demo where we could showcase our features. Their team found the trucks easy to operate and were impressed with Linde\u2019s service and quick response times. By the time their units arrived, they had full confidence in us.\u201d\n\nSince introducing Linde equipment, InterCentral Logistics has seen minimal downtime and high operational efficiency.\n\n\u201cThe reliability is excellent. The equipment arrived in pristine condition and has required very little maintenance,\u201d Ashley said.\n\nLooking ahead, he sees Linde playing an even greater role in their future operations.\n\n\u201cI hope to see a Linde fleet across all our warehouses. The machines are durable, easy to operate, and backed by excellent service. Linde has set itself apart with their reliability and the simplicity of their solutions.\u201d\n\nMia echoed this sentiment, emphasising the strong partnership between the two companies.\n\n\u201cInterCentral Logistics has been a fantastic partner, and we\u2019re committed to supporting their operations as they continue to grow. It\u2019s been great to see the positive impact Linde equipment has had on their business.\u201d\n\nFor more insights on Linde\u2019s material handling solutions, visit the Content Hub.",

I also had my own \u201cAddams Family\u201d moment in 2016 when I was a dancing ancestor in the musical. It wasn\u2019t a glamorous part, but it was so fun learning the moves and leaning into the kooky, macabre comedy. A professional cast is heading to the Wang Theatre to put on the production, and I\u2019m so excited to see the show. If that\u2019s not quite your cup of tea, there are other events happening this weekend, including a Nowruz celebration, a solo theatrical dance performance and more.\n\nThursday, March 20\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts, Boston is celebrating Nowruz, the ancient festival kicking off the start of spring, this Thursday. Uyghur photographer Ablikim E. Yulghun\u2019s \u201cMy Homeland Through the Camera Lens\u201d will be on display in the Linde Family Wing. His photographs capture stunning natural landscapes in the Uyghur region. In the Riley Seminar Room, kids can listen to a Nowruz-inspired story in Farsi and share their own Nowruz traditions and memories. There will be a drop-in, art-making event to decorate wooden eggs with paint markers in the Druker Family Pavilion. Aftab Dance Group will perform Persian dance in the Shapiro Family Courtyard. And there will be even more music, dance and art events happening throughout the evening. The event runs from 5-10 p.m., and guests can participate with a general admission ticket. After 5 p.m., general admission tickets are pay-what-you-wish with a $5 minimum.\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts, Boston will host a Nowruz celebration this Thursday. (Courtesy of Caitlin Cunningham Photography)\n\nFriday, March 21-Sunday, March 23\n\nThere will be plenty of double snaps and macabre references onstage at the Wang Theatre during \u201cThe Addams Family\u201d this weekend. The musical adaptation follows a grown-up Wednesday Addams who falls in love with a sweet, normal boy. He arrives at the Addams family home with his parents for dinner, and a night of secrets and kooky chaos ensues. Tickets start at $35.\n\n\u201cThe Addams Family\u201d will run at the Wang Theatre Friday, March 21-Sunday, March 23. (Courtesy Meredith Mashburn Photography)\n\nSaturday, March 22\n\nKingston Gallery is exhibiting \u201cDiane Novetsky: On the Cusp\u201d through March 30. The exhibition explores Novetsky\u2019s curvilinear forms. The organic shapes evoke celestial bodies and female forms. The Somerville artist utilizes saturated, bright colors inspired by the Italian Renaissance, connecting the past with a revitalized sense of freedom and sensuality. The abstract painter will be in conversation with artist Marjorie Kaye on Saturday from 2-3 p.m. The talk is free.\n\nSaturday, March 22\n\nHead to Rabb Hall in the Boston Public Library to celebrate people of color in folk music this Saturday. Artists Naomi Westwater, Pamela Means, Adeline Um and special guest poet Golden will perform. A 2024 WBUR Maker, Westwater developed the \u201cReclaiming Folk\u201d series last year to make space for musicians of color to tell stories through folk music. Registration is required, but the concert is free.\n\nSaturday, March 22-Sunday, March 23\n\n\u201cOuroboros\u201d by Nejla Yatkin is an immersive solo dance show. Yatkin is a 2023 Guggenheim Fellow in choreography who creates works that take audiences on journeys exploring humanity and her nomadic heritage. The audience enters a theater space set to look like a nomadic tent, and they are offered rosewater and Turkish delights. The performance draws on \u201cthe ancient ritual of a gathering circle to dance, sing and tell stories.\u201d The ouroboros is an ancient symbol of a snake or dragon curving in a circle and eating its own tail. It signifies the cycle of life, death and rebirth. The performance will explore memory, time and culture through dance, song and English, German, Turkish and ASL. After the performance, audiences will be invited to dance. The performance will take place at The Dance Complex in Cambridge, and tickets start at $17.85.

Planet A Ventures, Maersk Growth, SquareOne, Prof. Wolfgang Reitzle (former CEO of Linde) and Jim Hagemann Snabe (Chairman of Siemens) also took part in the funding round. The remaining \u20ac5 million come from approved research grants.\n\n\u201cTwo ingredients are crucial for the successful commercialisation of scientific innovation: talent and capital. We are delighted that we at C1 have excellent access to both ingredients\u201d, comments Christian Vollmann, CEO of C1 Green Chemicals AG.\n\nFounded in 2022, C1 develops climate-friendly chemical production processes by addressing chemical reactions from the atomic level all the way up to production scale. The first innovation to spin out of their quantum-chemistry platform is a novel, proprietary methanol catalysis.\n\nThis technology disrupts a \u201ccentury old chemical production process\u201d and enables them to unlock non-fossil feedstocks for the production of green methanol.\n\nC1 believes that green methanol will play a pivotal role in the defossilisation of the carbon-based chemical industry and is poised to become the alternative fuel of choice for net-zero shipping.\n\nAccording to C1, the market for green methanol is expected to grow to approximately \u20ac183 billion per year by 2050. The resulting CO2 saving potential of green methanol is several gigatons per year (several percentage points of current global CO2 emissions).\n\nGreen methanol can be used to defossilise three key industries: shipping, aviation and carbon-based chemical production. At the same time, the use of this circular raw material significantly reduces dependence on foreign resources and strengthens the industry\u2019s resilience.\n\n\u201cAt C1, everything comes together perfectly: Cutting-edge research targeting an ecologically and commercially significant problem, pragmatic founders with a clear vision, and a team boasting impressive technological and commercial expertise. This is exactly the profile we are looking for as entrepreneurial investors. It was immediately clear that we would take the lead in this round\u201d, says Markus Hannebauer from denkapparat.\n\nC1 will use the capital raised to build the \u201cworld\u2019s first demonstration plant for homogeneously catalysed methanol\u201c. Preparations for this are already underway, with construction slated to start this year.\n\nC1 has also recently recruited experienced chemists, chemical engineers and project managers from established companies such as Linde, BASF, Clariant, Shell and Tesla.",

            "content": "ROWE Racing has been competing in BMW M Motorsport race cars at the 24h N\u00fcrburgring since 2016 and boasts an impressive record. Besides the overall victory in 2020, the team, led by Team Principal Hans-Peter Naundorf, has finished second on the podium three times (2017, 2021, 2023). Last year, the BMW M Team RMG BMW M4 GT3 finished in third place.\n\nThis year, ROWE Racing aims for its second victory and BMW\u0092s 21st win at the endurance classic. Taking the wheel of the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO will be Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA). Farfus (2010) and van der Linde (2017 and 2022) are already on the winners\u0092 list of the 24h N\u00fcrburgring, while it would be a first for Krohn and Marciello. To prepare for the highlight, ROWE Racing will compete in the first two season races of the N\u00fcrburgring Endurance Series (NLS) on 22nd March and 26th April.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT4 EVO will also make its debut on the Nordschleife in the hands of BMW M Motorsport customer teams during the 2025 season. The BMW M2 Racing, which BMW M Motorsport will offer as a new entry-level car starting in 2026, will undergo test runs at the N\u00fcrburgring, including the 24-hour race. Additionally, many privately entered BMW race cars of various generations will excite the fans.\n\nStatements:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \u0093We are highly motivated to clinch the 21st overall victory for BMW at this year\u0092s 24-hour race. Last year, we were very close, and this time we are doing everything we can to stand at the top of the podium for the first time since 2020. With a top team like ROWE Racing and four high-class works drivers, we have created the best possible conditions. The fact that the three most important 24-hour races of the year take place on three consecutive weekends is a massive logistical challenge and anything but ideal. Nevertheless, our goal is to make the most of the situation and provide a great show for our many fans at the Nordschleife. The many private BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers will also contribute to this, giving the event its unique character.\u0094\n\nBj\u00f6rn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \u0093I am very much looking forward to seeing the EVO versions of our BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 in action for the first time at the world\u0092s toughest endurance race. The 24 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring is an absolute highlight for customer racing at BMW M Motorsport every year. The 20 overall and countless class victories over the past 55 years speak for themselves: BMW and the Nordschleife are inseparably linked. Seeing our BMW M2 Racing, which is still in development, in race action is another highlight of what will surely be another great weekend.\u0094\n\nHans-Peter Naundorf (Team Principal ROWE Racing): \u0093Fundamentally, with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, our experienced team, and our strong driver line-up, we have all the prerequisites to win at the N\u00fcrburgring for the first time since 2020. That is our goal. ROWE Racing is competing for the 14th time, and our drivers, including former N\u00fcrburgring winners Augusto Farfus and Kelvin van der Linde, as well as Raffaele Marciello and Jesse Krohn, need not shy away from any other crew. At the same time, the race calendar gives us the unique opportunity to stand at the top of the podium at two 24-hour races within seven days. These are the positives, but it must also be said openly that the very unfortunate scheduling of the 24h N\u00fcrburgring presents us with unprecedented organisational challenges. It hurts us that we can only present ourselves with one car to the great fans at the N\u00fcrburgring, but given the double burden with the 24h Spa-Francorchamps, it was not possible otherwise.\u0094",

            "content": "BNN Bloomberg is Canada\u2019s definitive source for business news dedicated exclusively to helping Canadians invest and build their businesses.\n\nTeal Linde, manager, Linde Equity Fund\n\nFOCUS: North American mid and Large cap stocks\n\nTop Picks: Air Canada, Pinterest, Alphabet\n\nMARKET OUTLOOK:\n\nTypically, 10 per cent or higher market declines are triggered by systemic economic threats that are out of the control of any one person. However, not this time where the ambiguous intentions of a single person threatening aggressive tariffs against much of the world has spooked investors. Unfortunately, the negotiation tactics that U.S. President Donald Trump brings to settling the trade war are destabilizing to the stock market. These tactics include his combination of anchoring high (asking for the moon), keeping everyone guessing, mixing in a lot of bravado, and using the media to maximize his leverage. This all contributes to amplified levels of uncertainty, which the stock market abhors. Trump though prides himself as a dealmaker. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the market that an agreement on trade policy be made and that it sticks. A lot will depend on his mostly mainstream economic advisors (based on their stated views before joining the administration) to reign in the U.S. president\u2019s more radical stances.\n\nAt the same time though, investors should position themselves in the likelihood the world does become more protectionist. This means owning companies that produce and sell within domestic markets, and prioritizing companies that offer services since tariffs primarily target manufactured goods. Technology companies should also remain a cornerstone investment because technology is the one bright spot in the global economy contributing to increased productivity, which is anticipated to accelerate with AI. If it weren\u2019t for the world\u2019s other troubles weighing progress down, technology could really thrive.\n\nMarket-moving news, fast: Get the BNN Bloomberg App now\n\nSign up for the Market Call Top Picks newsletter at bnnbloomberg.ca/subscribe\n\nTOP PICKS:\n\nAir Canada (AC TSX)\n\nFollowing the insiders, Air Canada is trading at significant discount to its historical valuation. Along with a rebuilt balance sheet, the company is performing a lot better today than five years ago during the onset of COVID-19 where it was trading at a similar price to where it is now. Believing its shares to be undervalued, in November 2024 when its share price was near $24, Air Canada management instituted a 1-year share buyback plan for up to roughly 10 per cent of outstanding shares, from Nov. 4, 2024 to Nov. 4, 2025. Demonstrating its conviction, the company bought 90 per cent of its allowable share repurchase within the first three months of a 12-month program. With its share price subsequently falling over trade war concerns, several insiders bought shares in late February around $17. Then on March 3, the board issued a boatload of stock options to management at a strike price of $17.03. Today, Air Canada shares can be purchased under $16 \u2013 lower than the price for the company\u2019s buy back, insider buys and stock option issuances. Air Canada represents an attractive turnaround opportunity currently trading at its five year baseline offering roughly 50 per cent upside upon a return to where it was trading at just four months ago.\n\nPinterest (PINS NYSE)\n\nPinterest is an attractive growth at a reasonable price stock where new management has made noticeable improvements over the last couple of years. The company\u2019s revenues are growing at about a 15 per cent annual rate while trading at P/E (price to earnings) under 18 based on 2025 expected EPS (earnings per share). Pinterest is a visual search and discovery platform in which users explore their interests, seek creative inspiration, and browse items they may want to purchase. Women make up around two thirds of its 500 million plus user base, while Gen Z users are more than 40 per cent of users and the fastest growing user cohort. Spurred by new management and their leveraging of AI and machine learnings, the company is increasing user engagement by making its content more relevant and more shoppable, while at the same time being able to increase its ad load. In terms of revenue growth potential, Pinterest currently earns an average revenue per user (ARPU) of US$9 from Americans and Canadians, US$1.38 from Europeans, and US$0.19 from the rest of the world. Having 80 per cent of its users in Europe and rest of the world, where monetization is in the early innings, underscores just how much ARPU, and total company revenue, upside exists for Pinterest.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL NASDAQ)\n\nAmong the mega cap tech stocks, Alphabet currently looks the most attractive from a growth, valuation and consistency perspective. Currently, Alphabet trades at the cheapest P/E multiple of the Mag 7 at 18.5 times next year\u2019s expected earnings. Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon are trading between 25 to 30 times earnings. One reason for the discount are the antitrust concerns. However, these risks seem sufficiently priced into the stock. Plus, there is uncertainty over how much the DOJ would want to extract from Google among the long list of remedies proposed. The recent disregard for the TikTok ban enforcement (despite the Supreme Court upholding the law), and rhetoric around protecting national security by emboldening America\u2019s Big Tech, suggest a deal could be on the table for Google to negotiate. And as for the threat from AI, the past two years have demonstrated that most of the behavior on products like ChatGPT are non-commercial in intent. Google\u2019s search revenues still increased 12.5 per cent last quarter, where the use of AI has contributed to higher user engagement.\n\nDISCLOSURE PERSONAL FAMILY PORTFOLIO/FUND AC TSX Y Y Y PINS NYSE Y Y Y GOOGL NASD Y Y Y\n\nPAST PICKS: March 18, 2024\n\nBROOKFIELD CORP.

This includes a 400% final cash dividend and a 4,100% interim cash dividend, which was declared during the first seven months of the year.\n\nThe company made this decision at its board of directors meeting on Thursday (13 March).\n\nIn anticipation of the dividend declaration, Linde Bangladesh's share price decreased by 3.01%, closing at Tk1,041.60 on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) today (13 March).\n\nTo formalise the 400% final dividend declaration, audited financial reports, and other agenda items, the company will convene its annual general meeting (AGM) on 29 May.\n\nThe record date for eligibility has been set for 9 April. The company has already paid a 4100% interim cash dividend to their shareholders.\n\nBasically, riding on the significant capital gains out of divestment of subsidiary Linde Industries Pvt Ltd, Linde Bangladesh recommended the highest interim dividend for its shareholders for the period of January to September period of last year, according to its disclosures published on the stock exchanges' websites earlier.\n\nEarlier, the multinational firm listed on the DSE and Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE) sold its major revenue-generating segment, the welding electrodes business, to the ESAB Group.\n\nHowever, the company did not disclose the selling value of its welding electrodes business.\n\nLinde Bangladesh earned around Tk600 crore from the divestment of its subsidiary, which was engaged in the welding electrodes business, according to sources.\n\nAccording to the DSE, sponsor-directors held a 60% stake in the company and 40% by the general shareholders, including the institutional and the general investors.\n\nSo, most of the dividend will be availed by the sponsor-directors of the company owing to their majority stake, and the dividend will be repatriated to the owner of Linde Bangladesh.\n\nAccording to its final disclosures, including extraordinary income, its earnings per share (EPS) stood at Tk421.94 in 2024, a significant jump from Tk15.02 at the end of 2023.\n\nHowever, its net asset value per share stood at Tk229.34 at the end of 2024, which was Tk371.27 in the previous year.\n\nSubsidiary transfer\n\nIn July this year, Linde Bangladesh's board of directors decided to transfer shares of Linde Industries Pvt Ltd to the ESAB Group.\n\nLinde Bangladesh owned 13.82 crore shares of the subsidiary, while its Company Secretary, Abu Mohammad Nisar, held one share.\n\nAccording to its disclosure, the firm transferred its holdings to ESAB Middle East FZE, and Abu Nisar transferred his share to Exelvia International Holdings.\n\nAccording to the ESAB website, it is a world leader in welding and cutting equipment and consumables, with business operations in 140 countries and 26 manufacturing hubs across the globe.\n\nLinde Bangladesh was incorporated in 1973 and listed on the DSE in 1976. It started its welding electrode business in 1979 and set up the first electrode plant in 1995 at Rupganj.\n\nSince then, it has regularly invested in this factory and set up three more lines to boost electrode production.",

            "content": "Linde plc ( ) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$469 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$413. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Linde's current trading price of US$453 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Linde\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Linde?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 37%, trading at US$453 compared to our intrinsic value of $331.73. This means that the opportunity to buy Linde at a good price has disappeared! Furthermore, Linde\u2019s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it\u2019s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Linde generate?\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Linde's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 33%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in LIN\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe LIN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on LIN for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for LIN, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

            "content": "In a qualifying session that was shortened due to a red flag, BMW M Team RLL\u2019s Dries Vanthoor won the overall pole Friday (March 14) for Saturday\u2019s IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship Mobil 1 12 Hours of Sebring. It is his second straight overall pole after taking similar honors at Daytona in January.\n\nVanthoor ended up .025 seconds ahead of Meyer Shank Racing with Curb-Agajanian\u2019s Tom Blomqvist in his Acura ARX-06. Porsche Penske Motorsport\u2019s Felipe Nasr will start third, followed by teammate Mathieu Jaminet. The customer Porsche 963 for Proton Competition\u2019s Neel Jani was fifth.\n\nThe GTP session started off with significant trouble for Action Express Racing\u2019s Jack Aitken. The Cadillac stalled exiting 1 on his out lap and Aitken was unable to get it ready. Eventually, the red flag was thrown to retrieve the Whelen Cadillac, ending Aitken\u2019s session. He will start 13th Saturday.\n\nThe red flag significantly cut down the amount of on-track time available. By the time the green came back out, there was only a couple of minutes remaining in the session. Time had to be added in order to get the minimum 10 minutes under green.\n\nNo one had set a time when the red flag came out. Porsche Penske Motorsport hadn\u2019t put their cars out at all. When the green came back out, it was a land rush onto the track.\n\nNasr put his Porsche 963 on top on his first lap at speed. He was hoping to improve, but could not do so.\n\nBlomqvist was able to usurp Nasr for the pole, but his time on pole did not last long. Vanthoor was able to take the pole away about 20 seconds later. That time held up for the overall pole.\n\nVanthoor\u2019s teammate Sheldon van der Linde was trying to equal his teammate\u2019s pace, but he ran into trouble. Van der Linde dropped his right rear wheel off the pavement exiting turn 1 and spun his BMW. He slid across the grass and bumped the wall. Luckily, van der Linde was able to drive away and not cause another stoppage, but he lost his chance to improve. He will start 10th.\n\nThe LMP2 class was the only class that required bronze-rated drivers to qualify. Here, United Autosports\u2019 Dan Goldburg was fastest early on.\n\nThere were a couple of issues during the session. First, CrowdStrike Racing by APR\u2019s George Kurtz spun exiting turn 5 on his first lap at speed into the dirt. Later on, Inter Europol Competition\u2019s Jeremy Clarke spun in turn 15, then rejoined in a particularly unsafe manner.\n\nTDS Racing\u2019s Steven Thomas eventually took the provisional pole away from Goldburg. However, he had to battle for it with AO Racing\u2019s PJ Hyett.\n\nThomas and Hyett swapped quick laps until Thomas set a lap at 120.425 mph with just under five minutes to go. That held up to give him the class pole.\n\nThomas won the pole by .115 seconds over Hyett. Nick Boulle in the second United Autosports entry was third, then Goldburg and Luis Perez Companc.\n\nKurtz ended up eighth, having had to deal with dirty, non-ideal tires after his spin. Clarke qualified 10th in class, but lost his best lap in the session due to bringing out a red flag near the end of Practice No. 1 Thursday morning.\n\nFor much of the GTD session, it was the Ferraris that were on top. Triarsi Competizione\u2019s Mike Skeen was fastest early on. Later on, AF Corse\u2019s Alessandro Pier Guidi, who normally drives one of the factory Ferrari AF Corse Ferrari 499Ps in the FIA World Endurance Championship, went to the front.\n\nWith six minutes to go, Vasser Sullivan\u2019s Jack Hawksworth went to the top with the first lap of the session under two minutes. Korthoff Competition Motors\u2019 Kenton Koch and Winward Racing\u2019s Philip Ellis, who were quick in practice Thursday, were right there as well.\n\nWith three minutes to go, Pier Guidi put down a lap at 113.018 mph. That lap ultimately stood up to win the class pole.\n\nPier Guidi ended up .387 seconds quicker than Koch. Hawksworth will start third, followed by Ellis. Cetilar Racing\u2019s Lorenzo Patrese, son of former Formula 1 racer Riccardo Patrese, will start fifth in his Ferrari.\n\nIn GTD Pro, teams waited a little bit before getting out there to set times. DragonSpeed\u2019s Albert Costa was right up there, along with AO Racing\u2019s Laurin Heinrich, who was fastest in two of the three practice sessions Thursday.\n\nUltimately, Costa set a lap at 112.929 mph with five minutes to go. That lap held up for the class pole. It is the team\u2019s first class pole in IMSA since 2019 in the LMP2 class.\n\nCosta\u2019s lap was .172 seconds faster than Heinrich. Paul Miller Racing teammates Neil Verhagen and Dan Harper were third and fourth. Corvette Racing by Pratt Miller Motorsports\u2019 Antonio Garcia was fifth.\n\nThe Mobil 1 12 Hours of Sebring is scheduled to go green at 10:10 a.m. ET. Coverage is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. ET on Peacock.",

            "content": "This episode marks the finale of Gyms with Jun. From the incredible wall of NCAA trophies at Roberts Pavilion to the shiny basketball court at Linde Activities Center, this series has helped me gain a greater understanding of the fitness scene at the Claremont Colleges.\n\nFor the final episode of the series, I\u2019m reviewing Scripps College\u2019s Tiernan Field House (TFH). The facility is quite comprehensive, offering students both a space to work out and a variety of services that prioritize wellness and community.\n\nNow, before I start speaking about the quality of the facility, I want to talk about the design of the gym, which was certainly the most unique and arguably the best out of the five gyms.\n\nMany 5C students fancy Scripps\u2019 architecture, as it boasts Spanish Revival-style buildings that resemble the missions of the West Coast; TFH was consistent with this look. While Pomona College and Claremont McKenna College have impressively shiny, modern buildings for their gym-goers, TFH left me starstruck.\n\nThe building has three floors and is connected to a beach volleyball court, swimming pool and soccer field.\n\nThe second floor is where most of the gym equipment is housed. Unlike at the other gyms, where the majority of the equipment is placed in a single room, the TFH\u2019s equipment is divided into three different rooms.\n\nOne room contains exclusively cardio machines, another strength-related equipment and the last a mix of both. In the hallways, there are medicine ball racks and yoga mats to borrow.\n\nAnother feature of the second floor is the set of balconies attached to the rooms. Students can use the mats placed outside for mobility and stretching exercises, all while looking out at a beautiful view of the swimming pool and the Claremont Colleges.\n\nThe equipment at TFH is also quite great. The gym certainly does not lack any important machines, with its best feature arguably being the platforms attached to the squat racks. These platforms allow lifters to drop their weights, which is helpful when they\u2019re trying to lift a new max lift.\n\nOne nitpicky downside to the equipment at the TFH is that there is only one set of each uniquely weighted dumbbell. If the gym is ever busy, gym-goers will likely have to wait to use the popular weights.\n\nLooking past the equipment at TFH, the facility also has two multipurpose rooms with mirrors for aerobics, stretching and cardio. One is on the second floor and is similar to the rooms housing the cardio and strength-related equipment. For me, though, the other room \u2014 a huge aerobics space located in the basement \u2014 is the standout of the two. It\u2019s accompanied by dozens of bikes, perfect for group kickboxing, pilates or meditation sessions; TFH offers these coach-led sessions to students free of cost.\n\nI was also impressed by all of the amenities that were attached to the building.\n\nNext to the gym is Alumnae Field, a natural grass soccer field connected to a beach volleyball court. On the other side of the gym, there\u2019s a swimming pool students can access through the basement. There\u2019s plenty of space for hanging out and relaxing by the pool chairs, especially when students aren\u2019t already spending their time in the wellness room or the kitchen on the first floor of TFH.\n\nLike how I rated Pitzer\u2019s gym, I will consider all of these amenities in my rating of TFH since they are directly attached to the main facility.\n\nTranslated into numerical scores, my review is as follows:\n\nQuality of the facility: 8.5/10. The quality of the machines is pretty standard and on par with the rest of the Claremont College gyms. However, I do think I have to give Tiernan a couple of extra points for its fabulous interior, which is consistent with the rest of the campus\u2019s Spanish-style architecture.\n\nAmenities: 9.5/10. The gym is secondary to its surrounding amenities. The pool, beach volleyball court and soccer field attached to the building are impressive. Now, the Pitzer gym had an entire restaurant, which is why I gave Tiernan a lower score, but it was awfully close.\n\nSize: 7.5/10. The space itself was decent, but the size of the gym didn\u2019t wow me. I was, however, impressed by the four different workout rooms as well as the separate aerobics room. Though these were smaller, extended balconies for stretching made me think I would never get tired of the space, even if it wasn\u2019t a three-story state-of-the-art mansion like the Roberts Pavilion.\n\nNon-exercise-related value: 5/10. There isn\u2019t much else for students hoping to do something besides exercise. There is the kitchen \u2014 a first for the 5C gyms \u2014 and the wellness lounge attached to it, but there\u2019s little space to get any work done.\n\nThe Tiernan Field House of Scripps College received an average score of 7.63.\n\nAs the famous, campus-renowned \u2018Gyms with Jun\u2019 series comes to an end, here\u2019s a comprehensive ranking of all the gyms around the Claremont Colleges.\n\nClaremont McKenna\u2019s Roberts Pavilion: 9/10 Pomona College\u2019s Center for Athletics, Recreation, and Wellness: 8.75/10 Scripps College\u2019s Tiernan Field House: 7.63/10 Pitzer College\u2019s Gold Student Center: 7.38/10 Harvey Mudd College\u2019s Linde Activities Center: 5.87/10\n\nDo I think any of these gyms are worth trekking across half of Claremont for? Maybe, maybe not. However, one takeaway from the series should be that regardless of what school you go to or what gym you work out in, the Scripps College gym\u2019s balconies are probably the best place to do your stretches.\n\nJun Kwon PO \u201928 is saddened to conclude the \u2018Gyms with Jun\u2019 series but is glad he can now go to sports games. Silently working out and taking notes about gym equipment is not nearly as fun as interviewing coaches after an overtime victory.",

            "content": "SEBRING, Fla. \u2014 Sebring Int\u2019l Raceway basked in warmth Thursday as action got underway for the 73rd edition of the Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring, the second round of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship.\n\nSporting a special livery celebrating the 50th anniversary of the creation of BMW North America and BMW\u2019s victory in the 1975 Sebring 12-hour race, Sheldon van der Linde drove the No. 25 BMW M Team RLL BMW M Hybrid V8 to the day\u2019s fastest practice lap.\n\nThe 25-year-old South African, who is embarking on his first full season of IMSA competition, lapped the historic 3.74-mile Sebring course in 1 minute, 47.884 seconds (124.800 mph) for overall and Grand Touring Prototype (GTP) class honors.\n\nThat was a scant 0.114 second quicker than the 1:47.998 (124.668 mph) tour turned in earlier in the 90-minute afternoon session by Tom Blomqvist in the No. 60 Acura Meyer Shank Racing with Curb Agajanian Acura ARX-06.\n\nUnlike the Rolex 24 staged in late January at an unseasonably cold Daytona Int\u2019l Speedway, Florida lived up to its moniker as The Sunshine State as 56 cars across four classes stepped up to the challenge of Sebring\u2019s notoriously bumpy surface.\n\nFor most of the afternoon practice, Blomqvist topped the timing screens in the Acura he is sharing at Sebring with Colin Braun and IndyCar champion Scott Dixon with a substantial 0.852-second cushion over the next fastest GTP entry, the No. 6 Porsche Penske Motorsport Porsche 963 with Matt Campbell behind the wheel.\n\nThen van der Linde put together his session-topping effort with 14 minutes remaining. Any chance of besting the BMW disappeared when Brendan Iribe made hard right-side contact with a tire barrier in Turn 13 to bring out the red flag with less than three minutes left on the clock. Amazingly, Iribe was able to drive his Grand Touring Daytona (GTD) class No. 70 Inception Racing Ferrari 296 GT3 back to the pits.\n\n\u201cSebring and BMW M Motorsport share a very special bond,\u201d stated Andreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport. \u201cThis track has played an outstanding role in our history in North America, which now spans half a century. We are excited for the anniversary weekend, and our goal is to add new milestones to those already displayed on the liveries of our BMW M Hybrid V8s.\u201d\n\nMeyer Shank Racing co-owner Mike Shank is searching for his first victory in the Twelve Hours of Sebring. Acura is the defending Sebring winner, with an ARX-06 fielded by Wayne Taylor Racing.\n\n\u201cTo me, Sebring is always the hardest race of the year,\u201d said Shank. \u201cThe place challenges every person on the team. We had a good test here last month and our team and HRC (Honda Racing Corp. US) continue to bond and integrate very well.\n\n\u201cLast year, the Acura won the race, and we anticipate the car and team will be able to perform at a very high level.\u201d\n\nThe Rolex 24-winning No. 7 Porsche Penske Motorsport Porsche 963 picked up right where it left off in the day\u2019s first 90-minute practice, with Nick Tandy setting the early benchmark with a 1:48.651 (123.919 mph) lap. That bested the pair of Meyer Shank ARX-06s by less than two tenths of a second, with Nick Yelloly in the No. 93 car ahead of Braun in the No. 60 car.\n\nThe opening session was red-flagged three times, the most significant when Danny Formal suffered an off-course excursion in the GTD class No. 45 Wayne Taylor Racing Lamborghini Huracan GT3 EVO2 that caused a 25-minute delay while a guardrail between Turns 1 and 2 was reconstructed.\n\nA shorter stoppage occurred earlier in the session when the No. 6 Porsche 963 stopped on course with an electrical problem during Mathieu Jaminet\u2019s out lap.\n\nThursday marked the official IMSA race weekend debut of the No. 23 Aston Martin THOR Team Aston Martin Valkyrie. The unique prototype features a screaming V-12 engine.\n\nRoss Gunn was able to lap within 2.2 seconds of van der Linde\u2019s fast time and his co-driver Roman De Angelis pronounced himself satisfied with the car\u2019s competitiveness in the early stages of the Aston Martin program.\n\n\u201cFirst time out, BMW, Porsche, and Cadillac all had the kind of growing pains that we\u2019re going through now,\u201d De Angelis said. \u201cWe need to keep doing what we\u2019re doing and just keep plugging away. We\u2019ve been saying all week that if we can survive Sebring, we can survive anywhere. Hopefully, Saturday is a good day for us where we can keep learning and keep developing.\u201d\n\nNicklas Nielsen turned the fastest lap of the day in the Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) class in the morning session at 1:50.403 (121.952 mph) in the No. 88 AF Corse ORECA LMP2 07.\n\nIn the GT classes, Laurin Heinrich was the only driver to break the 2-minute mark with his 1:59.898 (112.295 mph) tour in the GTD PRO class No. 77 AO Racing \u2018Rexy\u2019 Porsche 911 GT3 R (992). The No. 81 DragonSpeed Ferrari 296 GT3 enjoyed a good day in GTD PRO, with Davide Rigon going fastest in the morning practice and Albert Costa guiding the car to second in the afternoon.\n\nMercedes-AMG set the pace in both sessions in the GTD class, with Indy Dontje taking the honors in the No. 57 Winward Racing car in the morning and Kenton Koch pacing the afternoon in the No. 32 for Korthoff Competition Motors.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nX\n\n",

            "content": "Dublin, March 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Refrigerants Market by Type (HFC & Blends, HFO, Isobutane, Propane, Ammonia, Carbon Dioxide), Application (Refrigeration System, Air Conditioning System, Chillers, and MAC), and Region(Asia Pacific, North America, Europe, MEA) - Global Forecast to 2029\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\nThis report segments the market for refrigerants based on type, application, and region and provides estimations of value (USD million) and volume (Kiloton) for the overall market size across various regions. A detailed analysis of key industry players has been conducted to provide insights into their business overviews, services, key strategies, associated with the market for refrigerants.\n\nIn terms of value, the Refrigerants market is estimated to grow from USD 6.99 billion in 2024 to USD 9.56 billion by 2029, at a CAGR of 6.5%. The major factors contributing to the growth of the global refrigerants market are the increasing demand for consumer appliances, especially in Asia Pacific, and the growing pharmaceutical industry. The burgeoning disposable income, rising standard of living, and increasing manufacturing facilities of consumer appliances contribute to the market growth in the region. Factors restraining the growth of the refrigerants market are the increasing regulations against fluorine-containing refrigerants due to health and safety concerns. The growing use of natural refrigerants is expected to act as an opportunity for stakeholders to grow in the refrigerants market. Natural refrigerants are likely to be in high demand in the coming years, driven by the multiplying demand from domestic, industrial, and chiller applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsobutane is expected to be the second fastest-growing type of the refrigerants market, in terms of value, during the forecast period\n\n\n\nIsobutane (R-600a) is a natural refrigerant used in various refrigeration applications. It is an excellent substitute for hazardous refrigerants, including R12, R13a, R22, HCF, and CFC. R-600a is a naturally occurring component in gasoline. Due to its remarkable thermodynamic performance and minimal environmental effect, isobutane R-600a has attracted significant interest recently. It is a non-toxic chemical with zero ODP and a modest potential for global warming. Due to its eco-friendly property, R-600a has become a refrigerant gas of choice in small commercial refrigerants and domestic refrigerants.\n\n\n\nMAC is expected to be the fastest-growing application of the refrigerants market, in terms of value, during the forecast period\n\n\n\nMAC includes air conditioning in vehicles such as cars, trucks, and buses. The commonly used refrigerant in Mobile Air Conditionings is HFC134A. Another refrigerant R-1234yf is an alternative to the R-134A refrigerant used in mac. However, some European automobile manufacturers have raised the flammability issue using R-1234yf. Apart from fluorocarbon refrigerants, HC refrigerants are also used in MAC Refrigerants such as HFC-1234yf, HCs, and carbon dioxide have GWPs below 150 and have more potential to achieve fuel efficiency as compared to the existing R-134A systems. Currently, there is no regulation for using fluorinated refrigerant gases for MAC in buses and trains.\n\n\n\nAsia Pacific is projected to be the fastest growing region, in terms of value, during the forecast period in the Refrigerants market\n\n\n\nIn terms of value, Asia Pacific dominates the global refrigerants market, with China being the largest consumer of refrigerants globally. Increased investments and a rise in the number of new manufacturing establishments make Asia Pacific a prime market for refrigerants. Increasing government projects and infrastructure development are expected to drive the demand for refrigerants in applications such as chillers, refrigerators, and freezers. Additionally, the increasing economic growth, followed by substantial investment in the consumer appliances industry, will boost the demand for refrigerants in the region. The growing population, along with industry alliances, is also expected to propel market growth in the region.\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\nThe key players in this market include Arkema (France), Dongyue Group Limited (China), Honeywell International Inc.

            "content": "With its stock down 3.6% over the past week, it is easy to disregard Linde (NASDAQ:LIN). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Linde's ROE in this article.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Linde\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Linde is:\n\n17% = US$6.7b \u00f7 US$39b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.17 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Linde's Earnings Growth And 17% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Linde seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 9.8%. Probably as a result of this, Linde was able to see an impressive net income growth of 24% over the last five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Linde's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 10% in the same period, which is great to see.\n\nNasdaqGS:LIN Past Earnings Growth March 13th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Linde fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.",

The company\u2019s performance in the industrial gases sector, which serves as a reliable indicator of industrial cycles, remains stable across both consumer and industrial-facing segments. This stability is particularly evident in key markets such as Canada and Mexico, where customer behaviors have remained consistent.\n\nAdditionally, Linde\u2019s strategic positioning in essential sectors like healthcare, food and beverage, and electronics contributes to its resilience. Despite some currency headwinds, the impact is less severe than anticipated, with certain currencies strengthening to offset others. Furthermore, while regions like China and Europe are in holding patterns, the potential for policy changes could present future opportunities. These factors collectively support the Buy rating, reflecting confidence in Linde\u2019s ability to navigate and thrive amidst economic uncertainties.\n\nIn another report released yesterday, Barclays also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $510.00 price target.\n\nLIN\u2019s price has also changed slightly for the past six months \u2013 from $465.110 to $454.070, which is a -2.37% drop .\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "BMO Capital analyst John McNulty has maintained their bullish stance on LIN stock, giving a Buy rating today.\n\nJohn McNulty has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that suggest Linde is well-positioned for future growth. The management of Linde has demonstrated confidence in their growth strategy, focusing on stable pricing, a robust backlog, and strategic buybacks. Despite some uncertainties in end-market demand and macroeconomic factors, the company has managed to offset volume softness with favorable foreign exchange movements.\n\nFurthermore, Linde\u2019s pricing strategy remains strong, with expectations to pass through inflation-driven pricing across all regions. The company is on track to meet its organic EPS growth target of 8-11% by 2025, supported by efficiency gains, new projects, and a normalized energy cost environment. Additionally, Linde\u2019s focus on clean energy projects is expected to accelerate long-term earnings growth, contributing to potential multiple expansions. These factors collectively underpin McNulty\u2019s optimistic outlook and Buy rating for Linde\u2019s stock.\n\nIn another report released today, Barclays also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $510.00 price target.\n\nLIN\u2019s price has also changed slightly for the past six months \u2013 from $465.110 to $454.070, which is a -2.37% drop .\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "In the future, warehouse managers will increasingly be able to rely on artificial intelligence (AI) when it comes to optimizing material flow processes, incluidng real-time contraol of industrial trucks. At its tech showcase at the LogiMAT trade fair in Stuttgart, Linde Material Handling (MH) will demonstrate how this product vision works and is gradually becoming reality. The solution is based on NVIDIA\u2019s powerful Omniverse AI platform, which uses a digital twin to collect, process and analyze vast amounts of data from warehouse operations in real time. This initiative aligns with Linde MH\u2019s parent company, the KION Group, which recently announced a large-scale collaboration with NVIDIA, a leader in AI, and Accenture, an expert in digitalization, to take industrial automation to a new level.\n\nIn an area adjacent to Linde MH\u2019s exhibition stand, a scenario will be staged that could be typical of the warehouse of the future \u2013 manual and automated industrial trucks working side by side in perfect harmony with the help of innovative AI technology. This development will be particularly advantageous for operators of large fleets. The integration of intelligent hardware and software, combined with substantial computing power, will guarantee transparency of every process within the warehouse, ensuring more efficient, reliable and flexible order processing through continuous simulation. \u201cMachine learning and neural networks will enhance warehouse efficiency. Throughput will increase, both manual and automated fleets can be optimized and staff can be deployed more efficiently. This will lead to significant cost savings for companies,\u201d says Ulrike Just, Member of the Management Board responsible for Linde MH Sales & Service EMEA. \u201cAs a technology and innovation leader in our industry, we are at the forefront of developing AI-based solutions. These solutions represent a significant breakthrough, aiming to enhance our customers\u2019 competitiveness and ensure the long-term efficiency of their material flows. We are planning initial pilot projects with major customers, for whom the return on the investments involved will be particularly high.\u201d\n\nReal-time localization creates transparency\n\nThe first step in Linde MH\u2019s strategy is to network manual industrial trucks. To this end, the intralogistics specialist is currently developing a real-time localization system that works both inside and outside the warehouse. It enables seamless tracking of each vehicle\u2019s location using innovative, low-infrastructure ultra-wideband technology. An intelligent display provides drivers with navigation instructions and new or updated transport orders, with the system combining location data with vehicle data such as the steering angle. This allows routes to be adjusted in real time if, for example, there is too much traffic on a route, causing delays.\n\nAt some point, AI becomes indispensable\n\nAs warehouse operations become more complex, the optimization of routes and coordination of manual and automated industrial trucks places much higher demands on computing power. \u201cWhen there are 100 or more vehicles to coordinate, it\u2019s essential to utilize higher-level intelligence and hardware capable of handling such extensive data volumes,\u201d explains Ron Winkler, Managing Director of the Digital Business Unit at Linde MH. \u201cThis is where the NVIDIA Omniverse platform\u2019s AI comes in. It creates a digital twin of the warehouse, a virtual 1:1 replica of the physical environment.\u201d In this digital twin, simulations can be run in fractions of a second \u2013 either to optimize routes and optimally coordinate AMRs and manual forklifts, or to achieve optimizations in existing warehouse layouts.\n\nThe key advantage is that solutions to changing warehouse conditions, such as new orders or inventory fluctuations, traffic congestion in certain warehouse areas, obstacles or overhanging loads, can be identified in real time, simulated in the digital twin and communicated back to the vehicle control system. For instance, if a truck arrives late, the system can automatically assign the nearest forklift equipped for unloading. To achieve this, the NVIDIA Omniverse platform digitally stores all physical data on industrial trucks (e.g., engine power, steering angle) and infrastructure (e.g., rack locations, routes, machine times). This virtual space then processes the constant stream of information coming from sensors, intelligent vehicle and infrastructure cameras, warehouse management software and vehicle control systems.\n\nSimulation is the key\n\nIntelligent camera systems, strategically installed throughout the warehouse infrastructure and on both manual and automated vehicles are used to track load carriers, AMRs and manual vehicles. They also provide real-time monitoring of loading and storage areas. The images captured by these systems are then interpreted and processed directly by the AI.\n\nThe showcase at Linde\u2019s stand will demonstrate this in practice: A forklift driver transports goods to the receiving area using a Linde electric forklift. In the designated transfer area, a fully automated Linde pallet stacker then picks up the pallet for further transport into the warehouse. To seamlessly document and track materials and goods on the Omniverse platform, the manual truck\u2019s mobile, intelligent camera automatically takes a picture of the load when the pallet is picked up and stores it in the system. Concurrently, the camera captures the entire environment, identifying people and obstacles and instantly adapting the vehicle\u2019s behavior to the situation. The stationary cameras in the warehouse provide the system with information about the occupancy of the storage locations, while also detecting potential collisions with people, which would cause the trucks to reduce speed.\n\nHowever, what if the forklift driver does not place the pallet precisely on the specified surface, as an AGV typically requires? Via the stationary cameras, the digital twin recognizes the pallet\u2019s placement and directs the picking order to the Linde L-MATIC core. Thanks to the intelligent camera on the fully automated AGV, the AI detects the tilted pallet and determines a solution \u2013 in this case, the best approach to picking up the load. The cameras also identify problems such as cartons slipping or part of the load overhanging. In such cases, the AI concludes that the AGV should not pick up the load. The Linde L-MATIC core would halt and be reassigned to another transport order. Meanwhile, the AI calculates which manual guided vehicle is nearby to take over the transport task.\n\n\u201cBy configuring a digital warehouse twin, any conceivable infrastructure and fleet configuration can be simulated in 3D and tested for efficiency,\u201d explains Ron Winkler. \u201cThe AI can be continuously trained and refined. This sets the stage for a warehouse ecosystem that proactively solves challenges and keeps getting better and better.\u201d\n\nsimilar news",

            "content": "Munich. Since the 2015 season, Shell and BMW M Motorsport have been partners and have celebrated many successes together. Now, the collaboration is entering a new decade with the extension and simultaneous expansion of their joint contract. Shell is the Premium Technology, Innovation, and, in the future, also the Energy Partner of BMW M Motorsport. The partnership is visible worldwide in the biggest racing series, including the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC). The collaboration extends far beyond just the racing events.\n\nTen days ago, Shell and BMW M Motorsport celebrated the renewal of their partnership with the spectacular design of the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 at the FIA WEC season opener in Qatar. The LMDh car will compete in the entire World Championship season, including the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA), adorned in Shell's colours. BMW M works driver Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) remains the face of Shell in the cockpit of the BMW M Motorsport race cars. He will be a regular driver for the complete seasons in FIA WEC and IWSC. In both racing series, Shell prominently appears as a partner of BMW M Motorsport, highlighting the global dimension of the collaboration. Together with van der Linde, Shell celebrated its greatest sporting success in 2022 when the young South African became the DTM champion driving the Shell BMW M4 GT3.\n\nStarting from the 2025 season, Shell will simultaneously be the Premium Technology, Innovation, and now also the Energy Partner of BMW M Motorsport. Accordingly, BMW M Motorsport exclusively uses and promotes Shell products such as Shell Helix and Shell EV Plus. As part of their technology and development partnership, Shell and BMW M Motorsport are working on joint future projects. These include more sustainable lubricants, e-fluids for electric vehicles, and innovative fuel and energy concepts for motorsport projects. As Shell is also the official partner of the BMW M Trackdays, BMW M customers also enjoy the Shell premium products.\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \u201cWithout strong partners like Shell, engagements by BMW M in series production and BMW M Motorsport in racing are unthinkable. The fact that we can look back on ten years of collaboration is extraordinary \u2013 and I am very pleased that we are now reaching the next level together. In addition to close collaboration within our current racing programmes, the development of new future technologies in both the racing and series production sectors is crucial. As mobility and thus the entire automotive industry are changing rapidly, it requires partners who share our pursuit of innovation and perfection. This is absolutely the case with Shell.\u201c\n\nAysun Akik (Vice President of New Business Development and Global Key Accounts, Shell Lubricants): \u201cThis announcement marks an exciting milestone in our unwavering partnership with BMW M Motorsport. Over the last decade, we have been pushing the boundaries together celebrating successes in major race series all over the world. As the number one lubricants supplier, Shell will continue to deliver quality solutions and together with BMW M Motorsport, help bring the pleasure of driving to customers globally.\u201d",

            "content": "Goldrush Boland shrugged aside World Sports Betting Western Province with a convincing five-wicket victory, with 39 balls to spare, in the CSA One-Day Cup at Boland in Paarl on Sunday to book their spot in the final next Sunday.\n\nThe victory foundation was laid by the home side\u2019s spinners after Clyde Fortuin won the toss and elected to bowl first.\n\nShaun von Berg (10-0-44-3), Aviwe Mgijima (10-1-27-2), Imran Manack (10-1-32-2) and Siya Mahima (3.2-0-17-2) stifled the visiting batting line-up, bowling out WP for 182 inside 46 overs. In reply, a half-century from Blayde Capell (59) and support from Gavin Kaplan (46) guided the hosts to 183 for five from 43.3 overs to seal top spot and automatic qualification for the final.\n\nThe chase was a measured approach with Capell and Grant Roelofsen (29) setting the tone with an opening stand of 64 from 100 deliveries. Kyle Simmonds (5.1-11-1) broke the opening stand, clean-bowling Roelofsen, who had faced 53 balls, striking three boundaries.\n\nThe loss of Roelofsen\u2019s wicket did not present an opening for the visitors as Capell and Kaplan continued the march to victory with a 59-run stand for the second wicket off 84 balls. With Province losing their leading wicket-taker, Simmonds, George Linde (10-1-31-1) stepped up to dismiss Capell, caught on the long-on fence by Ollie Whitehead, who was on for the injured Simmonds.\n\nA few nerves were felt around the ground as Wesley Bedja (7-0-27-3) trapped Kaplan in front, castled Mgijima (25) and then sending Lehan Botha (8) back to the hut leg before. Kaplan faced 96 balls, striking three fours and a six, while Mgijima struck three fours in his 36-ball stay.\n\nHowever, Fortuin (7 not out) and Von Berg (1 not out) knocked off the final two runs needed for victory.\n\nEarlier, Province had made a steady start with the opening pair of Eddie Moore (51) and Tony de Zorzi (32) adding 62 from 85 balls before Aya Gqamane (5-0-22-1) broke through, having De Zorzi caught at mid-on by Mahima.\n\nDe Zorzi looked to be finding some form again, striking five boundaries in 42 balls before trying to slap Gqamane back over his head, only to find Mahima at mid-on. David Bedingham failed to find the boundary in his 19 balls before finding substitute fielder, Nathan Jacobs at long-off from the bowling of Von Berg.\n\nVon Berg then nabbed Bennie Hansen, trying to cut only to find the bottom edge through to Fortuin behind the stumps. Moore then went shortly thereafter, being cleaned-up by Mgijima after striking three fours and a six from 73 balls.\n\nGeorge Linde (38) and captain Kyle Verreynne (29) steadied the ship somewhat with a stand worth 41 from 47 balls for the fifth wicket but then Verreynne clipped a ball from Mgijima straight to Gavin Kaplan at short mid-wicket.\n\nVon Berg then had Onke Nyake caught at short extra cover by Lehan Botha without scoring before Manack trapped Kyle Simmonds (7) in front and having Dane Paterson (3) caught by Von Berg at short extra cover.\n\nMahima then cleaned up the tail, trapping Linde in front and then clean-bowling debutante Asakhe Tsaka with a beautiful Yorker for three.\n\nBOLAND: Blayde Capell, Grant Roelofsen, Gavin Kaplan, Aviwe Mgijima, Clyde Fortuin (capt, wk), Lehan Botha, Aya Gqamane, Shaun von Berg, Imran Manack, Glenton Stuurman, Siya Mahima.\n\nWESTERN PROVINCE: Tony de Zorzi, Eddie Moore, David Bedingham, Bennie Hansen, Kyle Verreynne (capt, wk), George Linde, Kyle Simmonds, Onke Nyaku, Dane Paterson, Wesley Bedja, Asakhe Tsaka.",

            "content": "Goldrush Boland shrugged aside World Sports Betting Western Province with a convincing five-wicket victory, with 39 balls to spare, in the CSA One-Day Cup at Boland in Paarl on Sunday to book their spot in the final next Sunday.\n\nThe victory foundation was laid by the home side\u2019s spinners after Clyde Fortuin won the toss and elected to bowl first.\n\nShaun von Berg (10-0-44-3), Aviwe Mgijima (10-1-27-2), Imran Manack (10-1-32-2) and Siya Mahima (3.2-0-17-2) stifled the visiting batting line-up, bowling out WP for 182 inside 46 overs. In reply, a half-century from Blayde Capell (59) and support from Gavin Kaplan (46) guided the hosts to 183 for five from 43.3 overs to seal top spot and automatic qualification for the final.\n\nThe chase was a measured approach with Capell and Grant Roelofsen (29) setting the tone with an opening stand of 64 from 100 deliveries. Kyle Simmonds (5.1-11-1) broke the opening stand, clean-bowling Roelofsen, who had faced 53 balls, striking three boundaries.\n\nThe loss of Roelofsen\u2019s wicket did not present an opening for the visitors as Capell and Kaplan continued the march to victory with a 59-run stand for the second wicket off 84 balls. With Province losing their leading wicket-taker, Simmonds, George Linde (10-1-31-1) stepped up to dismiss Capell, caught on the long-on fence by Ollie Whitehead, who was on for the injured Simmonds.\n\nA few nerves were felt around the ground as Wesley Bedja (7-0-27-3) trapped Kaplan in front, castled Mgijima (25) and then sending Lehan Botha (8) back to the hut leg before. Kaplan faced 96 balls, striking three fours and a six, while Mgijima struck three fours in his 36-ball stay.\n\nHowever, Fortuin (7 not out) and Von Berg (1 not out) knocked off the final two runs needed for victory.\n\nEarlier, Province had made a steady start with the opening pair of Eddie Moore (51) and Tony de Zorzi (32) adding 62 from 85 balls before Aya Gqamane (5-0-22-1) broke through, having De Zorzi caught at mid-on by Mahima.\n\nDe Zorzi looked to be finding some form again, striking five boundaries in 42 balls before trying to slap Gqamane back over his head, only to find Mahima at mid-on. David Bedingham failed to find the boundary in his 19 balls before finding substitute fielder, Nathan Jacobs at long-off from the bowling of Von Berg.\n\nVon Berg then nabbed Bennie Hansen, trying to cut only to find the bottom edge through to Fortuin behind the stumps. Moore then went shortly thereafter, being cleaned-up by Mgijima after striking three fours and a six from 73 balls.\n\nGeorge Linde (38) and captain Kyle Verreynne (29) steadied the ship somewhat with a stand worth 41 from 47 balls for the fifth wicket but then Verreynne clipped a ball from Mgijima straight to Gavin Kaplan at short mid-wicket.\n\nVon Berg then had Onke Nyake caught at short extra cover by Lehan Botha without scoring before Manack trapped Kyle Simmonds (7) in front and having Dane Paterson (3) caught by Von Berg at short extra cover.\n\nMahima then cleaned up the tail, trapping Linde in front and then clean-bowling debutante Asakhe Tsaka with a beautiful Yorker for three.\n\nBOLAND: Blayde Capell, Grant Roelofsen, Gavin Kaplan, Aviwe Mgijima, Clyde Fortuin (capt, wk), Lehan Botha, Aya Gqamane, Shaun von Berg, Imran Manack, Glenton Stuurman, Siya Mahima.\n\nWESTERN PROVINCE: Tony de Zorzi, Eddie Moore, David Bedingham, Bennie Hansen, Kyle Verreynne (capt, wk), George Linde, Kyle Simmonds, Onke Nyaku, Dane Paterson, Wesley Bedja, Asakhe Tsaka.",

The LAC meets some tough competition, facing off against the two flagship gyms \u2014 the CARW and Roberts Pavilion\u2014 and the surprisingly strong underdog, Pitzer College\u2019s Gold Student Center.\n\nSimilar to Pitzer College\u2019s gym, the LAC was not difficult to enter, even as a non-CMS student. While I did have to swipe my ID \u2013\u2013 something not required at Pitzer \u2013\u2013 they didn\u2019t stop me, and there was no line of questioning from the front desk workers.\n\nThe gym itself was certainly not the shiniest, fanciest facility I\u2019ve ever been inside. All the equipment was placed in one small room, and most of it was arranged very close together. The four treadmills were almost touching each other.\n\nAs for the weight machines, they were equally crammed into a small space, with little room for walking around in between. The benches on the free weights were quite close to each other, too. Though I did talk down on Pitzer\u2019s GSC for its space constraints, I was saddened to find that the LAC was an even further step down.\n\nThe quality of the equipment was also a letdown compared to the three gyms previously reviewed. The machines were quite old, the seats and benches were worn down and the weights were slightly rusty.\n\nDespite the visible wear and tear on the equipment, it was a pleasant surprise to see three barbell racks for the bench press and squats, especially because everything else in the gym seemed rather small-scale.\n\nI visited during dinner time on a weekend, which I would consider the gym\u2019s downtime. The gym was completely empty with one front desk employee, but I can see the space eventually getting quite crowded and busy simply because of its size.\n\nThe rest of the facility outside of the gym room itself, however, was a decent surprise. The lobby had a couple of couches, pool tables, ping-pong tables and an air hockey table.\n\nAcross from the gym, there was an aerobics room. I initially thought the main gym space had very few cardio machines, with one elliptical and four treadmills, but the aerobics room made it up with several other cardio machines around the wall. It hosts bikes, more ellipticals and some space for stretching and agility workouts.\n\nWith yoga mats, jump ropes and rollers available to borrow, students can use the aerobics room\u2019s spacious setting to finish their workout with some stretching or light cardio. There\u2019s also a punching bag in the middle of the room for any aspiring boxers.\n\nMy favorite part of the first floor of the LAC was its shiny gymnasium. It has a full-sized, brightly-lit basketball and volleyball court with CMS-branded floors. Compared to the rest of the gym\u2019s rather old-looking facilities, the gymnasium was a pleasant surprise.\n\nUnfortunately, the second floor did not contain much that was fitness-related. However, it was pretty cool to see lounges and meeting rooms upstairs, including a computer lab and a game room.\n\nAt the computer lab, students gathered to get some work done, while the game room seemed to be decorated with couches and fairy lights for students to relax comfortably. Students can definitely go there for a quick nap or even a study session with a group of friends.\n\nThe LAC also hosts tournament-style competitions and events. It notably hosted the annual Dean Chris Classic basketball tournament and has upcoming events for spikeball, volleyball and ping-pong.\n\nTranslated into numerical scores, my review is as follows:\n\nQuality of the facility: 5/10. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the space. The equipment is definitely older and more worn out than that of the other gyms, and it was all crammed together. There weren\u2019t any particular stand-out qualities about the workout space itself, but I was a big fan of the basketball gymnasium.\n\nAmenities: 6.5/10. On top of the gym, I was pretty impressed by the recreational space on the first and second floors. It had nice ping pong and pool tables, plus a computer lab and gaming room that students could utilize even without working out.\n\nSize: 4/10. The gym itself was not very big, and the workout space was the smallest out of all four gyms reviewed so far. I do think it deserves some credit for having the full-sized gymnasium, but that is not saying much.\n\nNon-exercise-related value: 8/10. I think the facilities are actually quite great for getting some work done or getting a power nap in. This might be the one gym where you can truly get some studying done before the midterm, and do it out of free will, because the computer lab is that nice.\n\nThe Linde Activities Center at Harvey Mudd College is fourth, with an average score of 5.87 out of 10. Next week, we\u2019ll conclude the series with a review of the gym at Scripps College.\n\nJun Kwon PO \u201928 is glad he started the \u2018Gyms with Jun\u2019 series as it keeps him accountable and forces him into a workout for the TSL articles. However, despite pretending to be a fitness and gym enthusiast, it\u2019s really difficult to hide his dislike for the 23-minute walk from Pomona\u2019s south campus to Harvey Mudd\u2019s gym.",

Additionally, customer teams Ceccato Racing, Century Motorsport, and Paradine Competition will take on the challenge in one of the world's most competitive GT racing series .\n\nIn the Endurance Cup, an impressive number of eight BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars will compete in the entire season consisting of five races. ROWE Racing, in car #98, will feature the BMW M works driver trio of Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI). Also, three works drivers will pilot the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO for Team WRT: Ugo de Wilde (BEL), Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), and Charles Weerts (BEL). Jens Klingmann (GER), as the seventh works driver, will participate in the full season, sharing the cockpit of the AlManar Racing by Team WRT #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO with Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA) and Ben Tuck (GBR). WRT\u2019s car #30 will be driven by Gustav Bergstr\u00f6m (SWE), Gilles Stadsbader (BEL), and Etienne Cheli (FRA). Additional entries in the Endurance Cup include teams Ceccato Racing and Century Motorsport with one car each, and Paradine Competition with two BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars. In one of these cars, Darren Leung (GBR) will receive support from BMW M works drivers, mainly Dan Harper (GBR), who, however, will not be able to compete in all races due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nIn the Sprint Cup, five BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars will compete in all five race events, three from Team WRT and two from Paradine Competition. Kelvin van der Linde and Weerts, Klingmann and Al Zubair, as well as Bergstr\u00f6m and Stadsbader are the WRT drivers participating in both cups, competing for points and titles in the overall GT World Europe standings. In the Sprint Cup, Leung will also have a works driver \u2013 again mainly Harper \u2013 by his side.\n\nLast season, six GT World Europe titles went to BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers.

We have very strong pro crews with which we aim to compete for overall victories and titles. Additionally, there are pleasingly many customer teams taking on the challenge in one of the strongest GT racing series in the world and also aiming for titles in all classes. In its first races this season in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, our BMW M4 GT3 EVO immediately achieved victories and demonstrated its enormous potential. Hopefully, many more will follow throughout the season.\u201d\n\nBj\u00f6rn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \u201cI am proud of the impressive line-up of BMW M Motorsport customer teams and drivers in the GT World Challenge Europe. We won several titles in different classes in 2024. We aim to build on this record and ideally even expand it. I can't wait to walk through the paddock and see the large number of BMW M Motorsport cars.

The open house marks the first concert of Artfinity, an MIT music and arts festival with 80 scheduled events from Feb. 15 to May 2, 2025.\n\nThe event featured the Institute\u2019s different music groups, such as the MIT Laptop Ensemble and MIT Jazz Ensemble. Hands-on workshops for the public were also held at the open house by groups like the MIT Balinese Gamelan and Rambax, a Senegalese drum ensemble. At night, MIT Music held SONIC JUBILANCE, a sold-out concert to celebrate the opening of the music building. The concert featured four world premieres composed by MIT Music faculty and performances by MIT\u2019s eight music ensembles.\n\nThe new music building started with the late philanthropist Joyce Linde\u2019s cornerstone gift in 2018. Linde is the wife of the late Edward H. Linde \u201962, a former MIT Corporation member. Linde\u2019s gift helped address the Institute\u2019s need for a central music space. Previously, MIT did not have a main music building for music classes and rehearsals, as they were spread across different places on campus.\n\n\u201cThe choice of spaces responded to long standing priorities that the music program has identified over 20 years,\u201d Prof. Keeril Makan wrote in an email to The Tech. Makan is the associate dean of MIT\u2019s School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS), and a professor of music composition. In the proposed building plan, these spaces included a concert hall, rehearsal rooms, a recording studio, and a classroom for world music instruction.\n\nThe building is designed by SANAA, a Tokyo-based architectural firm that received the 2010 Pritzker Architecture Prize. It is located next to Kresge Auditorium, and is approximately 35,000 square feet. The building consists of three distinct brick volumes that surround a glass lobby, and underneath the building is a two-level parking garage with more than 140 spaces.\n\nOne main feature of the Linde Music Building is the Thomas Tull Concert Hall, a performance venue with a maximum seating capacity of 390. Unlike traditional concert halls where the stage is in the front and the seats follow a row configuration, the Tull Concert Hall has the performers in the center of the circle. As a result, the rows of the audience form a ring around the performers. The circular layout of the concert hall was inspired by the Pierre Boulez Saal in Berlin.\n\nAccording to Makan, the purpose of this special arrangement is for the audience to have \u201cless separation\u201d from the performers, allowing the experience to be \u201cmore intimate.\u201d For instance, a piano recital in the concert hall would enable the audience to view the pianist from an angle that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t in a conventional setting. The seats in the concert hall are also configurable to meet the specific needs of the performance, such as demounting seats for a chorus, or removing seats at the front row for a larger music ensemble.\n\nBesides the unique seating arrangement, the Tull Concert Hall has features for adjustable acoustics; this includes the acoustic banners that can be lowered to reduce reverberation time and a ring of speakers that offer reinforcement. By doing so, the concert hall is able to accommodate various kinds of music performances.\n\nNext to the Tull Concert Hall is the Music and Culture Space, a music space for the MIT Balinese Gamelan and Rambax. Previously, the two music ensembles were taught in Building N52. Given that the ensembles\u2019 sounds have loud volumes, the space has walls insulated with felt for acoustic insulation. In addition, the wide open space allows for classes to have music demonstrations more easily versus a traditional lecture room, as in the case for Introduction to World Music (21M.030).\n\nThe third volume of the Linde Music Building is the Music Maker Pavilion, a four-story building that contains rehearsal rooms, a recording studio, offices, a research lab, and a music makerspace. The rehearsal rooms have double height ceilings and drapes for acoustics. Similarly, the offices are acoustically treated so music faculty members can play instruments and compose in the office. The music makerspace is for digital instrument design and music technology prototyping, while the research lab is for students and faculty in the new Music Technology and Computation program that will begin in Fall 2025.\n\nThe Linde Music Building will help support MIT\u2019s large music program that has a yearly enrollment of over 1,500 students and over 500 musicians. Makan hopes that the music building will not only help \u201cfoster community\u201d for the music students, but also for the general MIT community. \u201cI hope that going to concerts at Tull Hall in the Linde Music Building becomes a regular part of everyone\u2019s lives at MIT.\u201d\n\nA correction was made on March 7, 2025: An earlier version of this article mislabeled the Thomas Tull Concert Hall as the Thomas Hull Concert Hall.",

In 11 matches, he scored 161 runs at a strike rate of 153.33 and claimed 11 wickets at an impressive economy of 6.29. More recently, he featured for Western Province in the One-Day Challenge Division One, scoring 106 runs and picking up four wickets in five games.\n\nThe report also said that captain Temba Bavuma and batter Tony de Zorzi have recovered from illness and will train with the squad on Tuesday evening.\n\nSouth Africa has been hit hard by injuries throughout the tournament, with key pacers Anrich Nortje, Gerald Coetzee, Nandre Burger, and Lizaad Williams all ruled out before the competition began. Meanwhile, left-arm seamer Kwena Maphaka remains with the squad as a traveling reserve.\n\nSource: IANS\n\nAbout Gopi Gopi Adusumilli is a Programmer.

South Africa are scheduled to take on New Zealand in the second semi-final in Lahore on Wednesday, March 5.\n\nSouth Africa have called in left-arm spinning all-rounder George Linde as part of travelling reserves ahead of their Champions Trophy 2025 semi-final against New Zealand. Linde will be a cover for Aiden Markram, who hurt his hamstring in South Africa's final group stage match against England. Markram, who was the acting captain for the England game, mentioned in the post-match chat that it was a precautionary decision not to field or bat after he hurt himself.\n\nLinde won't be part of the official squad unless Markram is ruled out. As per ESPNCricinfo, Markram is set to undergo a fitness test on the match day and final call on him will be taken before the toss. If Markram does miss the game, South Africa are likely to retain Tristan Stubbs in the playing XI with Temba Bavuma likely to come back in. Bavuma and Tony de Zorzi missed the England match due to illness with Stubbs opening the innings for the Proteas.\n\nLinde is set to join the squad Tuesday evening, on the eve of the semi-final clash. Losing Markram, if he does miss the knockout match, could hurt South Africa's balance even though he hasn't been required to bowl in the couple of games the Proteas have played. Linde was exceptional in the SA20 2025 for the eventual champions MI Cape Town scoring 161 runs striking at 153.33 while taking 11 wickets at an economy of 6.29.\n\nKagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, Keshav Maharaj, Marco Jansen and Wiaan Mulder will be the five bowlers and if not Markram, Stubbs might be required to bowl his part-time offies. South Africa have had to take a tumultuous journey to travel from Karachi to Dubai and back to Lahore in a span of 24 hours but now have had a couple of days to put their feet up, rest, train and get ready for the crunch game.\n\nNew Zealand are coming off a loss in the final Group A clash against India in Dubai but will start as favourites because of the all-round depth in their squad and experience of playing some games in Pakistan now.",

It is likely that South Africa added him to the group in the event that they qualify for a Dubai final against India, where conditions are drier and they need an extra spinner.

The exact time has been earmarked for Markram\u2019s fitness test to assess whether he will be able to play in the semi-final at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore or not.\n\nLinde, who has played three Tests, two ODIs and 16 T20Is for the national team, will not join the squad officially until and unless Markram is declared unfit and is ruled out of the tournament. The ICC's event technical committee will then confirm the swap.\n\nLinde\u2019s addition as cover to the squad comes in the wake of South Africa\u2019s likely chances of playing the final of the Champions Trophy in Dubai against India. Because of dry conditions, assistance for the spinners, and with Linde being in great form (11 wickets & 161 wickets in SA20 2025), Linde\u2019s selection makes a lot of sense.\n\nSouth Africa only have two spinners in their squad - Keshav Maharaj and Tabraiz Shamsi, but only Maharaj has got game time so far. India played four spinners against New Zealand in their last group-stage game in Dubai.",

            "content": "Linde plc's (NASDAQ:LIN) periodic dividend will be increasing on the 27th of March to $1.50, with investors receiving 7.9% more than last year's $1.39. This takes the annual payment to 1.2% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Linde\n\nLinde's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. Based on the last payment, Linde was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.\n\nThe next year is set to see EPS grow by 40.6%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 31% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.\n\nNasdaqGS:LIN Historic Dividend March 2nd 2025\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2015, the dividend has gone from $2.60 total annually to $5.56. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 7.9% over that duration. It's good to see the dividend growing at a decent rate, but the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Linde might have put its house in order since then, but we remain cautious.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. We are encouraged to see that Linde has grown earnings per share at 28% per year over the past five years. Linde is clearly able to grow rapidly while still returning cash to shareholders, positioning it to become a strong dividend payer in the future.\n\nWe Really Like Linde's Dividend\n\nOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Linde is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.\n\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. As an example, we've identified 2 warning signs for Linde that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

            "content": "Linde India Limited ( ) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 15% in the last quarter. But that doesn't undermine the fantastic longer term performance (measured over five years). To be precise, the stock price is 887% higher than it was five years ago, a wonderful performance by any measure. So it might be that some shareholders are taking profits after good performance. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price. We love happy stories like this one. The company should be really proud of that performance!\n\nWhile this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment.\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Linde India actually saw its EPS drop 9.5% per year.\n\nEssentially, it doesn't seem likely that investors are focused on EPS. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.\n\nWe doubt the modest 0.2% dividend yield is attracting many buyers to the stock. On the other hand, Linde India's revenue is growing nicely, at a compound rate of 13% over the last five years. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. So we recommend checking out this free\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Linde India, it has a TSR of 912% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Linde India has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 7.4% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 59% per year, is even more impressive. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. You could get a better understanding of Linde India's growth by checking out of earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nBut note: Linde India may not be the best stock to buy.

However, following regulatory challenges and operational irregularities, its foreign branch license was revoked in 1999, resulting in its reformation as Sonali Trade & Finance UK Limited.\n\nIn 2001, Sonali Bank (UK) Ltd began operations under a new banking license issued by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), with the Finance Ministry holding 51% and Sonali Bank 49% ownership.\n\nHowever, SBUK faced significant regulatory challenges, including a \u00a33.25 million fine from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which replaced the FSA, in 2016 for deficiencies in its anti-money laundering (AML) framework.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny led to a temporary ban on new deposits and placement on the FCA AML Watchlist. Extensive remediation, including a \u00a333.47 million capital injection, resulted in the institution's removal from the watchlist in 2018.\n\nHowever, ongoing challenges culminated in the revocation of its banking license by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in 2022.\n\nWith a focus on innovation and regulatory readiness, SBUK is set to expand its global footprint and enhance economic ties between Bangladesh and the UK.\n\nSBUK has partnered with PwC under Project Phoenix to strengthen compliance and risk management.\n\nStrategic transition, financial success\n\nAmid regulatory changes, SBUK launched Project Phoenix, transitioning into a Non-Bank Financial Institution (NBFI) focused on Trade Finance and Financial Institution services.

            "content": "The full-year results for Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) were released last week, making it a good time to revisit its performance. It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$33b and statutory earnings per share of US$13.62 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that Linde is executing in line with expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Linde\n\nNasdaqGS:LIN Earnings and Revenue Growth March 1st 2025\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Linde from 24 analysts is for revenues of US$34.0b in 2025. If met, it would imply a credible 2.9% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to increase 9.2% to US$15.15. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$34.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$15.22 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.\n\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$496. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Linde at US$540 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$381. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that Linde's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 2.9% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 4.5% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 4.4% annually. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Linde is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.",

In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$34.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$15.22 in 2025.

The most optimistic Linde analyst has a price target of US$540 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$381. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and growth estimates. We would highlight that Linde's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 2.9% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 4.5% p.a. growth over the last five years.

On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$496, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Linde.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best Natural Resources Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) stands against other best natural resources stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.\n\nNatural resource stocks are an important part of the global economy, representing mining, energy, and agricultural companies. These industries are the foundation of numerous sectors, providing necessary materials for infrastructure, technology, and transportation. Despite the growing emphasis on renewable energy, fossil fuels, metals, and agricultural resources remain essential for modern economies. According to The Business Research Company, the global mineral market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2%. This growth emphasizes the long-term importance of natural resources.\n\nThe top 40 global mining companies generated a record $943 billion in revenue in 2022, but this figure declined to approximately $792 billion in 2024, owing primarily to fluctuating commodity prices. Despite this, Deloitte reported that between January and mid-November 2024, the oil and gas industry paid out $213 billion in dividends and $136 billion in buybacks, demonstrating the sector\u2019s strong cash returns.\n\nHowever, the natural resource sector has been experiencing a surge in market activity, driven mainly by commodity price movements and global demand. Precious metals, in particular, have proven to be strong assets. Over the past year, the market\u2019s Gold Index returned 44.59%, while the Silver Index returned 42.01%. These gains have resulted from rising investor interest in safe-haven assets due to inflationary pressures and escalating global trade tensions. As inflation erodes the value of fiat currencies, investors are increasingly turning to gold and silver as safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty.\n\nMoreover, technological advancements such as Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) platforms are increasing the efficiency of offshore gas production while reducing reliance on onshore infrastructure. According to Business Wire, global liquefied natural gas (LNG) liquefaction capacity is expected to double by 2028 from 473 million tons per annum (MTPA) in 2023 to 968 MTPA as expansion projects continue. This projected increase indicates that even as the world strives for cleaner energy sources, natural gas will continue to play an important role in the global energy mix.\n\nWhile efforts to reduce global carbon emissions continue, natural resource companies are adjusting by balancing traditional operations with sustainability initiatives. For example, the UAE has pledged $30 billion to a global finance fund while its banking sector aims to invest $270 billion in green finance by 2030 to support renewable energy growth. Simultaneously, Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, which manage $3.8 trillion in assets, are increasingly allocating capital to green investments. This shift has not only reduced fiscal breakeven burdens for energy companies but has also increased regional economic stability.\n\nThe chemicals industry is also shifting to sustainability, with renewable production of key chemicals such as ammonia, methanol, and olefins expected to cost between $440 billion and $1 trillion by 2040. According to PwC, this figure could rise to between $1.5 trillion and $3.3 trillion by 2050.\n\nSimilarly, innovative zinc recycling techniques have produced a 95% recovery rate from steel mill waste, converting industrial waste into useful recyclable components. Nanotechnology breakthroughs are increasing recovery efficiency in gold mining while reducing environmental impact. These technological advancements demonstrate the growing significance of technology in maximizing resource use and cutting waste, which propels the natural resource industry forward.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 7 Best Natural Resources Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds, we first conducted extensive research to identify companies with significant exposure to the natural resource sector. We defined exposure in terms of mining, energy production, agriculture, or the extraction and processing of key commodities. We then analyzed these companies based on their hedge fund holdings and ranked them based on the number of hedge fund investors who held stakes in these companies, as per the Q4 2024 data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nLinde plc (NASDAQ:LIN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 70\n\nLinde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) is a global leader in the industrial gas industry, serving a variety of sectors in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. The company supplies vital atmospheric and process gases, including helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen to industries such as manufacturing, electronics, healthcare, and energy.\n\nLinde plc (NASDAQ:LIN)\u2019s financial performance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 was strong and stable, with sales of $33.0 billion and a 7% increase in adjusted operating profit. Volumes increased across the Americas and Asia-Pacific segments, owing to higher pricing and successful project launches in electronics and industrial manufacturing. Despite a 5% revenue decline in its Engineering division, the company\u2019s third-party equipment backlog remained solid at $3.3 billion. Linde also continued to provide significant returns to shareholders, with $7.1 billion distributed through dividends and buybacks.\n\nMoreover, Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) has significantly expanded its portfolio as part of its commitment to clean energy. The company signed a long-term hydrogen supply agreement with ExxonMobil\u2019s Baytown facility and made significant progress on a $1.8 billion blue hydrogen project in Beaumont, Texas. The company also completed major air separation unit expansions in China, meeting increased demand for rare gases and semiconductor-grade nitrogen. While these initiatives fueled growth in many areas, the EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) region\u2019s sales fell by 2% due to lower industrial activity in manufacturing and chemicals.\n\nLooking ahead, the company remains optimistic about its prospects, projecting an 8%-11% increase in adjusted EPS in 2025. This expansion will be aided by a $10.4 billion project backlog and ongoing investments in industrial gas infrastructure and hydrogen production.

Robin Frijns (NED) also made it into the top-ten Hyperpole with the sister car.\n\nDuring the race, the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 initially fell back, but the team, including Vanthoor, Kevin Magnussen (DEN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI), fought their way back to the top positions with strong lap times over the ten-hour race. In the end, only the three Ferraris, which battled among themselves for the win, were faster. The #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Frijns, Ren\u00e9 Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), was at one point in third place but finished seventh due to varying strategies.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, a BMW M Motorsport crew celebrated a podium finish. Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin (AUS) drove the #31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO to third place, mounting a remarkable comeback from 14th on the grid after a setback in qualifying. The #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, piloted by Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), faced challenges and finished eleventh in the LMGT3 class.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \u201cThis was a very good start to our second season in the FIA WEC. Our two BMW M Hybrid V8s showed strong pace from the Prologue, and with a second place in qualifying, we underscored our ambition to compete for the podium. Unfortunately, the Ferraris were a bit too strong in the race, but we are satisfied with fourth and seventh places. We are happy about the important points for the World Championship standings and the continuation of our positive trend from the end of the 2024 season and the Daytona IWSC opener a few weeks ago. We can definitely build on this performance. Congratulations to Augusto Farfus, Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin for their podium in the LMGT3 class. Our new BMW M4 GT3 EVO has once again proved that it can be a guarantee for success. Thanks to everyone who worked hard over the winter to get us into this good starting position for the season.\u201d\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): \u201cLooking at where we were in Qatar a year ago, we have improved significantly. Not making it to the podium with our hypercar is tough, but the Ferraris were hard to beat. The guys did an incredible job, and we are happy to take the result home. Of course, we want more, but we collected important points here. In the LMGT3 category, we had a challenging weekend and not the fastest car. Still, making it to the podium with the #31 is very positive. The #46 seemed to lose some pace during the race. We need to analyse the reasons for that.\u201d\n\nDries Vanthoor (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 4th place): \u201cAfter starting second, fourth place might not be the result we hoped for, but we didn't have a flawless race \u2013 including from my side. Without these mistakes, we could probably have fought for third place, even though there was no way past the Ferraris this weekend. They were incredibly fast in every session, making it very difficult to beat them. That was clear from the start. I think we can be satisfied. I believe we can be proud of the progress we've made compared to last year. However, we are not there yet. It's clear that we are not the fastest yet \u2013 so we need to keep working hard.\u201d\n\nSheldon van der Linde (BMW M Team WRT, #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, 7th place): \u201cThat wasn't bad. We can really be satisfied with the progress we've made in a year. Looking at where we were last year \u2013 both cars outside the top-ten \u2013 we've made a huge step forward. I think we can really be proud of BMW M Motorsport for giving us a car that we can really race with. The drivability has improved tremendously, and that now allows us to compete with other cars. As a driver, that's a great feeling because you feel that you're also doing a better job.\u201d\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 3rd place LMGT3 class): \u201cConsidering where we started and where we finished the race \u2013 nobody would have predicted this. It shows what a great team we have behind us and what a strong driver lineup, as we executed it perfectly. Taking a podium home feels like a win. After qualifying, we wouldn't have expected this result. Third place gives us great hope that we can maintain the momentum.\u201d\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 11th place LMGT3 class): \u201cIt's frustrating that we finished the race outside the top-ten. We have so much potential within the team and our driver line-up. For some reason, we didn't have the same pace as our sister car. The team will investigate this. We also need to put the penalties behind us. We need to deal with it, shake off the result, and look forward.\u201d",

            "content": "In the digital era we live in, many white-collar employees work from home and other remote areas. Office camaraderie exists only among those whose physical presence is required in the workplace.\n\nThat\u2019s the most obvious blight of advanced technology in the field of communications, and it affects every aspect of communications.\n\nThirty and more years ago, The Jerusalem Post was located in its previous premises in Romema. The printing press was in the basement; the newsroom, where the copy editors worked, was filled with people day and night; and the adjoining room for reporters was also often full.\n\nSection and senior editors sat in a row of offices that stretched across both rooms. Though there were always a few people out on assignment, they came back to the office to type up their stories. Much of that no longer exists: Reporters and feature writers work from home, as do some editors, and workplace camaraderie today is largely limited to the Internet team.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, the conference room was packed to overflowing with present employees and past members of the editorial staff. FROM LEFT: Moran Samuel, Michal Herzog, Danna Azrieli and Danny Hakim. (credit: Shaul Landner)\n\nThey came to bid farewell to popular former editor Steve Linde who left The Jerusalem Post last month after almost three decades.\n\nFollowing his initial spell as night editor, Linde became managing editor and then editor-in-chief of the Post before taking over as editor-in-chief of The Jerusalem Report, the Post\u2019s flagship magazine \u2013 until he felt it was time to move on.\n\nLinde came to the Post from Israel Radio and left the Report for JNS \u2013 a digital Jewish news syndicate, which has attracted some of his former colleagues from the Post, a factor that makes him feel more at home in a new location.\n\nThere were several speeches at the farewell, and while everyone was sad to see him go, most were happy to have the opportunity to chat face-to-face, and many lingered for quite a long time.\n\nThe common thread in the speeches was Linde\u2019s admirable professionalism, his ability to stay calm in a crisis, his willingness to help anyone with a problem, be it personal or professional, and his remarkable memory for the birthdays of every member of the editorial staff. It appeared that everyone present had benefited from one or more of Linde\u2019s qualities. Stay updated with the latest news!

They ignore the fact that he has been a consistent voice calling for the return of the hostages and that he has met numerous times with released hostages and families of hostages still in captivity. He has also met with and paid condolence calls on families whose loved ones were murdered by Hamas or died after being kidnapped and taken to Gaza.\n\nIn all his meetings with foreign dignitaries at home and abroad, Herzog has raised the hostage issue by giving interviews to global media outlets in which the main topic was the hostage situation. He has also frequently called for a state investigation into what did or did not happen on October 7, 2023.\n\nHerzog arranged for the President\u2019s Residence to be bathed in orange light to honor the memories of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas on the day of their funerals as a symbol of national mourning.\n\nHe and his wife, Michal, have been more involved with the fate of the hostages than any other public figures. Last week, during their visits to Hungary and Italy, they again brought the urgency of the release of the hostages to the attention of the leaders of those countries.\n\nIn Hungary, where they participated in ceremonies honoring the memories of the tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews who had been deported to Auschwitz never to return, the Herzogs visited Budapest\u2019s famed Dohany Street synagogue, reputed to be the largest in Europe with a seating capacity of 3,000.\n\nThe synagogue dates back to 1859 and is located close to the birthplace of Zionist visionary Theodor Herzl.\n\nHerzog unveiled a plaque marking his official visit, some 34 years after his father, Chaim Herzog, Israel\u2019s sixth president, had done the same.\n\nThe unveiling took place in almost exactly the same spot. The new plaque, placed alongside his father\u2019s one, was also crafted from the same material, symbolizing the Jewish tradition of the continuity of generations.\n\nWomen's Leaders Summit\n\n\u25a0 IN HER own right, Michal Herzog brings subjects such as the release of the hostages, bereaved families, sexual abuse, and mental health into all the events she attends, with or without the president, and in all probability will do so again at the Post\u2019s Women Leaders Summit on March 25.\n\nShe may relate to only one of these topics, or to more as she did when she attended the awards ceremony for the winners of the Second Annual Azrieli Prize for Outstanding Social Sports Coaches at the Daniel Rowing Center in Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cSport can be a tremendous source of resilience and support, physically and mentally,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many, it is a vital tool for rehabilitation.\u201d She also credited sport with building community, identity, and a sense of belonging.\n\nAmong the winners was a coach whose athletes with intellectual-developmental disabilities won two medals at the Special Olympics European Championships and a Bedouin coach who established the first sports club in a Bedouin village in the South.\n\nAdditionally, a special recognition award was given to the Open Field program \u2013 a sports rehabilitation initiative for Supernova festival survivors.\n\nAdjudicators were mainly key figures from Israeli sports, including Olympic and Paralympic medalists Arik Zeevi and Moran Samuel.\n\nThis is the second year that the Azrieli Foundation has awarded the Azrieli Prize for Outstanding Social Sports Coaches. The award, established as part of the Sport for Social Impact (SSI) program and its vision to promote and strengthen Israeli society through sports and physical activity, recognizes coaches who have demonstrated exceptional achievements in the use of sports to promote social and educational goals.\n\nChair of the Azrieli Group and the Azrieli Foundation Israel, Danna Azrieli, who leads the foundation\u2019s philanthropic vision and activities, was in attendance, along with her husband, Azrieli Foundation Canada board member and honorary president of the Paralympic Committee Danny Hakim, Knesset Sports Subcommittee chair MK Simon Davidson, and Japanese Ambassador Yusuke Arai, as well as representatives of other diplomatic missions. Also present were the chairman of the Paralympic Committee Moshe Motz Matalon and Olympic medalist Arik Zeevi, as well as heads and representatives of sports federations, centers and NGOs involved in sports for social advancement.\n\nIn the category of Women\u2019s Sports Advancement, Hanan Abu Kweder, 43, who established the first fitness club in an unrecognized Bedouin settlement in the Negev \u2013 a Pilates and strength-training coach from the Suar Almahaba Association \u2013 was given an award for pioneering work in promoting healthy and active lifestyles and advancement for women in the Bedouin community, breaking social boundaries and leading unique initiatives combining sports and educational values.\n\nIn the Special Populations category, Hadas Handler, 27, a swimming and cycling coach from the Special Olympics, was awarded for her work in advancing these two sports for people with disabilities, while creating an adapted and empowering environment for each athlete.\n\nThree athletes with intellectual and developmental disabilities flew to represent Israel at the Special Olympics European Championships in cycling and won two significant medals.\n\nIn the Shared Society category, Suha Sobeh, 40, a football coach from Tamra, working at the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation, earned her award for using football as a tool to promote shared living between Jewish and Muslim women, empowering girls and women and creating cultural connections between diverse communities, even under challenging conditions.\n\nIn the At-Risk Populations category, Jonathan Sidelsky, 40, a cricket coach from the Israel Cricket Association, was recognized for his dedication and creative approach to making sports in general and cricket, in particular, accessible to at-risk youth, creating empowering experiences and offering emotional support while building a diverse and inclusive sports community.\n\nIn the Promising Coach of the Year category, Dana Hadar, 26, a water sports coach from the Ziv Neurim Association, was awarded for her unique contribution to advancing at-risk youth and children with special needs through water sports.\n\nThe Special Recognition award was given to Safe Field for collaboration between NGOs using sports as a tool for social advancement by aiding rehabilitation and community integration through football and footvolley.\n\nThe program is a partnership between the Home Base, Safe Heart, and Balance \u2013 Back on Track associations, helping participants return to routine through social integration, assistance with rights fulfillment, encouragement of mental health treatment, and workplace integration.\n\nTelling Israel's story\n\n\u25a0 MANY WELL-KNOWN Israeli personalities become prominent figures in international organizations with little or no fanfare, but their presence is important because they help to tell Israel\u2019s story.\n\nOne such person is former legislator and cabinet minister Dan Meridor, a member of the advisory board on the Washington headquartered Radio Abraham, a recently launched broadcasting initiative that embraces a new era of regional cooperation \u2013 breaking barriers, fostering economic partnerships, and strengthening cultural ties between Jews, Arabs, and Muslims. Other Israelis on the advisory board include Gen. (ret.) Yaakov Amidror and Gen. (ret.) Ruth Yaron, along with Robert Silverman, a former US diplomat, who now teaches at Shalem College in Jerusalem.\n\ngreerfc@gmail.com",

            "content": "On February 26, 2025, Linde PLC (LIN, Financial), the world's leading industrial gas supplier, filed its 10-K report, revealing a financial performance with approximately $33 billion in revenue for the year 2024. This SWOT analysis delves into Linde's financial health and strategic positioning, drawing insights from the company's latest SEC filings. Linde's financial tables indicate a robust balance sheet, with significant goodwill and intangible assets reflecting its market leadership and past strategic mergers. The company's global presence and diverse product offerings have enabled it to maintain financial stability through various business cycles, despite the inherent risks associated with its operations.\n\nStrengths\n\nMarket Leadership and Brand Recognition: Linde PLC's dominant position in the industrial gases market is a testament to its strong brand and extensive global reach. With operations in over 100 countries, Linde has established itself as a key player, particularly where it has pipeline networks offering reliable and economic supply. This infrastructure provides a competitive edge, ensuring customer loyalty and enabling economies of scale. The \"Linde\" trademark itself is a significant asset, symbolizing quality and reliability in the industry.\n\nStrategic Talent Management: Linde's commitment to talent management is a critical strength, as evidenced by its strategic business objectives and executive compensation tied to performance in this area. The company's proactive approach to inclusivity and workforce development, coupled with competitive compensation packages, positions Linde to attract and retain top talent. This focus on human capital is essential for innovation and operational excellence, contributing to Linde's sustained competitive advantage.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nCyclical Industry Exposure: Despite its diversified customer base, Linde's performance is susceptible to economic downturns in cyclical industries such as chemicals, metals, and energy. These sectors' volatility can lead to fluctuations in demand for Linde's products, impacting the company's financial stability. Additionally, the potential for impairment losses on tangible and intangible assets during industry downturns poses a financial risk.\n\nEnergy Cost Dependency: As the production and distribution of industrial gases are energy-intensive, Linde's profitability is heavily dependent on energy costs, primarily electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel. While contractual measures are in place to mitigate price fluctuations, unpredictable energy markets could lead to increased operational costs and reduced profit margins.\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechnological Innovation: Linde's investment in research and development positions the company to lead in technological advancements within the industrial gases sector. By developing new applications and advanced process technologies, Linde can meet evolving customer needs and open new market opportunities. This focus on innovation is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge and driving future growth.\n\nGeographic Expansion: Emerging markets present significant growth opportunities for Linde. As these regions develop their industrial capacities, demand for industrial gases is likely to increase. Linde's established global presence and expertise position it well to capitalize on this growth, potentially increasing its market share and revenue streams.\n\nThreats\n\nGlobal Economic Uncertainty: Linde's international operations expose it to risks associated with political and economic instability. Global economic uncertainty, including trade conflicts and currency fluctuations, can adversely affect investment activities and demand for Linde's products. Such conditions could lead to reduced revenue and impact the company's strategic growth plans.\n\nOperational Risks: Linde's reliance on the continuous operation of its production facilities and delivery systems introduces risks such as equipment failures, natural disasters, and cyber-attacks. These events could disrupt Linde's ability to meet customer demands, result in significant financial losses, and damage the company's reputation.\n\nIn conclusion, Linde PLC (LIN, Financial) exhibits a strong market position and brand recognition, bolstered by strategic talent management and a focus on technological innovation. However, the company must navigate weaknesses such as exposure to cyclical industries and energy cost dependency. Opportunities for growth in emerging markets and through technological advancements are promising, yet Linde must remain vigilant of threats from global economic uncertainty and operational risks. The company's forward-looking strategies, including geographic expansion and investment in R&D, will be pivotal in leveraging its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

            "content": "With a price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 33.9x Linde plc ( ) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 18x and even P/E's lower than 10x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.\n\nWith earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Linde has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.\n\nWhat Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?\n\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nThere's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Linde's to be considered reasonable.\n\nIf we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 8.0%. This was backed up an excellent period prior to see EPS up by 87% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.\n\nTurning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 12% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 11% each year growth forecast for the broader market.\n\nWith this information, we find it interesting that Linde is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.\n\nWe've established that Linde currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.\n\nBefore you settle on your opinion, we've discovered that you should be aware of.\n\nYou might be able to find a better investment than Linde.

            "content": "Oksana Linde, \u201cTraves\u00edas\u201d\n\nBy Matthew Blackwell \u00b7 February 25, 2025\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nOn the 29th of January, 1991, a strange story appeared in the newspaper in Caracas, Venezuela. \u201cThe Sounds of the Future Fight for Life,\u201d ran the headline. \u201cIs electronic music elitist? Is it a fad?\u201d it asked. The article was about the 3er Encuentro de la Nueva M\u00fasica Electr\u00f3nica (Third Conference of New Electronic Music), whose participants answered both questions with a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nOksana Linde was among the artists at that influential concert. After she resigned from her job as a research scientist due to health problems caused by chemicals used in the lab, Linde began collecting electronic instruments. She purchased a used Polymoog, a TEAC 4-channel reel-to-reel tape recorder, and a Casio CZ-1. Through the \u201880s and early \u201890s, she slowly built a home studio and recorded 60 pieces, very few of which were published. While other Venezuelan electronic artists like \u00c1ngel Rada and Miguel Noya had released their music, it was difficult for Linde to gain traction in a niche, male-dominated field. \u201cIt was not easy to get labels to record my music,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was still a world that was not very appreciated, not very well known.\u201d\n\nBuh Records founder Luis Alvarado discovered Linde\u2019s work through Facebook in 2020 and set about restoring her to her rightful place in electronic music history. Aquatic and Other Worlds caused waves, garnering international press. Traves\u00edas is the much-anticipated follow-up, presenting another selection from Linde\u2019s personal archive.\n\nTraves\u00edas continues Linde\u2019s fascination with distance, from the deep sea to deep space. \u201cMundos flotantes,\u201d \u201cHorizontes lejanos,\u201d and \u201cArrecifes del espacio\u201d formed part of Linde\u2019s concert at the 1991 Encuentro, which was titled \u201cTraves\u00eda Acuastral\u201d (Aquastral Crossing). These pieces are dreamy yet dramatic, taking the listener on a journey from a \u201cfloating world,\u201d across \u201cdistant horizons,\u201d and finally to \u201creefs in space.\u201d One of the last tracks that Linde recorded is 1994\u2019s \u201cSahara,\u201d which makes clear her debt to Claude Debussy, her primary influence. One of Linde\u2019s foundational musical memories is hearing the French composer\u2019s \u201cThe Sunken Cathedral,\u201d which caused her to imagine a \u201chuge cathedral drowning,\u201d all full of blue and grey. Despite \u201cSahara\u201d\u2019s arid title, it too summons images of grand monuments being swept away.\n\nAfter the healer Julio C\u00e9sar Gonz\u00e1lez discovered Linde\u2019s music, he commissioned a series of songs to be used in meditation sessions. From this encounter, she became interested in Reiki, a form of meditation meant to transfer healing energy from the hands (she has since disassociated herself from the practice). The commission resulted in seven pieces, four of which are presented here: \u201cLuci\u00e9rnagas en los manglares,\u201d \u201cKerepacupai vena,\u201d and \u201cEstrellas I & II.\u201d These gentle, upbeat tracks tap into a larger movement combining electronic synthesis and meditative healing in the \u201880s underground, from Pauline Anna Strom to Agartha.\n\nThere\u2019s still much work to be done in recovering the work of women electronic composers, especially outside of Europe. Oksana Linde\u2019s archive is among the most revelatory finds in recent memory, and Traves\u00edas further secures the legacy suggested by her debut album. More than that, it\u2019s a pleasure to dive into and float away.",

            "content": "Doha. On the weekend before the season opener of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) in Qatar, four BMW M Motorsport cars completed numerous test laps during the Prologue at the Lusail Circuit. The BMW M Hybrid V8 made a strong impression and set the fastest time. The two hypercars and the two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs were presented for the first time in their new designs .\n\nOn Friday and Saturday, the two BMW M Team WRT hypercars completed more than 700 laps. Robin Frijns (NED) was the fastest in the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, achieving the overall best time in the fourth and final test session in 1:38.971 minutes. The #15 sister car ranked fourth. In the LMGT3 class, the #31 and #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVOs completed more than 650 laps. In the overall ranking of the four sessions, the two cars ended up tenth and eleventh.\n\nBoth hypercars will enter their second FIA WEC season in 2025 in the new Inception design by BMW M Motorsport. Car #15 will sport the traditional BMW M colours, while car #20 will feature the colours of Premium Technology Partner Shell.\n\nComments before the Qatar 1812 KM:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \u201cOur goals for our second FIA WEC season are ambitious. We aim to build on the clear upward trend from the second half of the 2024 season and be in a position to consistently compete for podium places with our BMW M Hybrid V8. This applies to the entire season, but especially for the major highlight at Le Mans. Here in Qatar, we want to start the year with good results. During the prologue, we focused on running through our intensive test programme and gathering important information. Finishing with the fastest time is always nice, and we\u2019re heading into race week with a positive mindset. In the LMGT3 class, we are looking forward to the debut of the new BMW M4 GT3 EVO. The car has won its first two races, demonstrating its great potential. The clear season goal is to contend for the World Championship title and a victory at Le Mans.\u201d\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): \u201cSo far, I think, we have a good working base. We gathered good and important information. I am quite happy. We did not have any major issues with the cars. Of course, there is still some work to be done but overall, we are quite satisfied.\u201d\n\nKevin Magnussen (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8): \u201cWe were following the plan. I got many laps but of course it\u2019s testing and you never know how competitive you are so we were just focusing on the programme. Things are running according to plan and we keep working. Now I\u2019m looking forward to the race.\u201d\n\nRobin Frijns (BMW M Team WRT, #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8): \u201cI think it went alright. We had a test programme before arriving at Qatar, we followed it pretty much and everything feels fine. Now we need to put the puzzle together and prepare ourselves for the race which is a bit different. As we don\u2019t drive at night during FP1 and FP2, Saturday was our only opportunity so that was quite important for us. Now it\u2019s all about discussions and see how we can improve the package we have for the race.\u201d\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO): \u201cThe track here has a big evolution across the weekend by having a lot of sand on the first day so it\u2019s our job to understand the track evolution and the tyre evolution. This year, we are racing with a brand-new EVO car so we also have a lot to learn on that side. Overall it\u2019s good to be back in the FIA WEC paddock and also to get to know my new teammates. It has been the first time that I met them and we have a good spirit. So let\u2019s get everything ready for the big one.\u201d\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO): \u201cFirst of all, it was good to have two days of testing before the start of the season because you have a bit of time to work on the car, other than during the race. I think that we improved a lot from Friday to Saturday and the feeling is not so bad. The tyre consumption makes a big difference here, so we tried a lot of things to improve this aspect that was a bit difficult for us sometimes in the past. Overall, it is difficult to understand where we are at the moment. We need to wait for the race. But on Saturday I felt comfortable with the car, I was able to drive a double stint and my pace was good so it is positive and the team always works hard. We are not the fastest yet, we need to improve but we are on a good way.\u201d\n\nThe BMW M Motorsport line-ups at a glance:\n\nHypercar class, BMW M Team WRT\n\n#15 BMW M Hybrid V8 #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 Kevin Magnussen Robin Frijns Raffaele Marciello Ren\u00e9 Rast Dries Vanthoor Sheldon van der Linde\n\nLMGT3 class , The Bend Team WRT, Team WRT",

TOP MAN: George Linde George Linde (37) and Kyle Simmonds (35 not out) were the only two batters to cross the 30 mark, as WP slumped to their second loss in three matches.\n\nMeanwhile at St George\u2019s Park, spinners Imran Manack and Shaun von Berg played key roles with the bat to help Boland chase down 198 against the Warriors on Saturday. After winning the toss and bowling, the visiting bowlers responded well by limiting their hosts to under 200 in 43.4 overs. Ayabulela Gqamane was the pick of the bowlers with 3/24, while there were doubles for Manack (2/48), Lehan Botha (2/28) and Akhona Mnyaka (2/32).",

Their interest signals a growing global focus on India\u2019s emerging chip manufacturing ecosystem.\n\nThe Role of Chemicals and Gases in Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nSemiconductor production relies on over 150 chemicals and more than 30 gases and minerals. These materials are crucial for ensuring reliability, safety, and innovation in chip fabrication. They enable essential processes such as etching, doping, cleaning, and depositing ultra-pure layers on silicon wafers.\n\nMerck Plans a Specialty Chemicals Plant in India\n\nMerck is in discussions with the Indian government to establish a specialty chemicals plant for semiconductor manufacturing. The proposed investment could range between $300 million and $500 million. The company has yet to finalize the location for the facility.\n\nMerck acknowledged its interest in India\u2019s semiconductor industry, stating that it has been monitoring developments over the past few years. \u201cIndia is becoming an increasingly important partner in the global semiconductor ecosystem. However, it is too early to discuss specific investment numbers,\u201d a company statement revealed.\n\nLinde to Establish High-Purity Gas Plants\n\nLinde, a global player in industrial gases and engineering, also plans to set up manufacturing facilities for high-purity gases in India. The company affirmed its commitment to supporting India\u2019s semiconductor growth. \u201cLinde actively supports investments in this critical sector and is committed to enabling its expansion in India,\u201d the company stated.\n\nBuilding a Complete Semiconductor Supply Chain\n\nIndustry experts emphasize the need for ancillary companies to establish a presence in India. Navin Bishnoi, country head of Marvell India, highlighted the importance of a robust supply chain.\n\n\u201cTo build a successful semiconductor ecosystem, we need suppliers of gases, chemicals, wafers, tools, and equipment. These ancillary companies played a crucial role in Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor success and are now gradually entering India,\u201d Bishnoi explained.\n\nProximity to Fabs is Crucial for Uninterrupted Supply\n\nNeil Shah, Vice President of Research at Counterpoint Research, stressed the importance of proximity for bulk and specialty gas suppliers. Shah noted, \u201cTo ensure seamless supply, gas plants should be within 40 kilometers of semiconductor fabs\u201d.\n\nLinde already has a strong presence in India and supplies industries, including the country\u2019s only semiconductor fab, the Semi-Conductor Laboratory in Mohali. Competitors like Korea Gases and Taiyo Nippon Sanso must act quickly to secure a foothold in India\u2019s growing semiconductor market, Shah added.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith India making strides in semiconductor manufacturing, the arrival of global specialty chemical and gas producers is a significant step.\n\nAs reported by economictimes.com, investments from companies like Merck and Linde will help establish a stable supply chain, reinforcing India\u2019s position in the global semiconductor ecosystem.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) stands against other best global stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nThe United States has long been a magnet for global businesses seeking to tap into its robust economy and dynamic financial markets. Several key economic policies and initiatives have been instrumental in encouraging these enterprises to remain active participants in US stock markets. The US offers the world\u2019s largest consumer market, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $25 trillion and a population of 335 million. Household spending accounts for nearly a third of global consumption, making it an attractive destination for businesses aiming to expand their market reach. The regulatory environment is conducive to starting and operating a business, ensuring that companies, regardless of origin, compete on an even playing field. This transparency and predictability in the legal system bolster investor confidence and encourage sustained engagement in US stock markets.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nTo further promote foreign direct investment (FDI), the US Department of Commerce launched the SelectUSA program. Since its inception, SelectUSA has facilitated more than $250 billion in investments, leading to the creation or retention of over 230,000 jobs. By providing actionable information and serving as a liaison between investors and economic development organizations, SelectUSA plays a pivotal role in attracting and retaining global businesses in the US market. The US has also implemented tax reforms aimed at creating a more business-friendly environment. The country continues to invest in infrastructure and technological innovation, providing businesses with the necessary tools and resources to thrive.\n\nAccess to cutting-edge technology, a skilled workforce, and a culture of innovation fosters an environment where companies can grow and remain competitive. Despite these advantages, global businesses must navigate challenges such as economic and political uncertainties. Recent reports indicate a shift in investment preferences, with some investors reconsidering their concentrated investments in US markets due to factors like stretched valuations and geopolitical tensions. For instance, a significant reduction in US stock holdings has been observed, with nearly 90% of investors viewing US equities as overvalued, per a recent Reuters report. This trend underscores the importance of continuous policy evaluation to maintain the attractiveness of US stock markets.",

This is due to the growing demand for zero-emission vehicles, driven by environmental concerns and stringent regulations on emissions, which is increasing the need for hydrogen refueling stations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZero-Emission Vehicles, of which hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles are a part, do not emit any pollutants from their tailpipes, thereby making them quite potent options in efforts at decreasing urban air pollution and meeting climate goals. A growing Zero Emission Vehicles market directly increases the demand for supporting infrastructures like hydrogen refueling stations. Policies and regulations that have a bias for hydrogen as a source of clean energy drive market growth.\n\nThe hydrogen fueling stations market is dominated by a few major players that have a wide regional presence. The leading players in the hydrogen fueling station market are Air Liquide (France), Linde PLC (Ireland) Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (US), Nel ASA (Norway), MAXIMATOR Hydrogen GmbH (Germany), and Hydrogen Refueling Solutions (France) among others. The major strategy adopted by the players includes new product launches, partnerships, collaboration, mergers, and investments & expansions.\n\n\n\nMid-sized station, by station size segment to be the fastest-growing market from 2024 to 2030\n\n\n\nFor medium-sized stations, operational efficiency can be higher due to optimized usage of resources and reduced downtime. They somehow balance the underutilization of small stations and the possible overburdening of large ones, thus assuring more stable performance. Another point is that the technology required for medium-size stations is more mature and widely available than that for large stations. This technological feasibility reduces the development risks and encourages investment in mid-sized infrastructure.\n\n\n\nFurther, mid-sized stations have a better way of infiltrating markets by targeting areas of moderate to high demand. Their size offers the versatility needed for deployment in many locations, adding to the overall coverage of the market and accessibility to customers. Furthermore, the total economic viability of the mid-sized stations in construction, maintenance, and operation serves the forecasted growth of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle market quite well. This balance in their economy makes them a much-preferred choice for long-term investments.\n\n\n\nEPC, by solution, is expected to be the fastest-growing market from 2024 to 2030\n\n\n\nEPC companies provide end-to-end turnkey solutions for the management of projects right from design to completion. Basically, this is an end-to-end solution that most of the investors and developers find very attractive because it relieves them of the complexity of the project. In addition, EPC companies come with special, sound expertise and vast experience in large-scale infrastructure projects, assuring high-quality execution of works with conformity to industry standards. This is a key competence to the successful delivery of hydrogen fueling stations.\n\n\n\nBesides, the duration of a project can be reduced by EPC companies through overlapping project phases and by Management of resources. With faster project completion times, it enables the meeting of market demand, gaining competitive advantages. Moreover, the complex regulatory environment is better negotiated when EPC firms are fully aware of the industry's regulations and compliance requirements. This way, the expertise will ensure that a project meets all the necessary legal and environmental standards.\n\n\n\nOn-site, by supply type, is expected to be the fastest-growing market from 2024 to 2030\n\n\n\nOn-site hydrogen generation does away with the process of transporting hydrogen from off-site production plants to the users, hence saving a lot on the associated transportation costs and eliminating the confusions related to logistics. Apart from this, on-site production reduces emissions concerned with the transportation of hydrogen over long distances, thereby saving the overall carbon footprint and confirming the environmental sustainability objectives.\n\n\n\nOn-site production reduces the risk of danger associated with transporting and handling large quantities of hydrogen. This raises the overall safety of the hydrogen supply process. On-site production systems are capable of being optimized to meet the needs of an individual fueling station and therefore offer better flexibility in terms of production capacity and hydrogen purity. Given that on-site systems can be fielded more rapidly than an extended off-site production and distribution infrastructure, they would enable faster establishment of new hydrogen fueling stations.\n\n\n\nNorth America is expected to be the fastest-growing region in the hydrogen fueling stations market.\n\n\n\nGovernments in the United States and Canada provide financial incentives by way of subsidies in the form of tax credits and grants for the development of hydrogen fueling infrastructure to encourage the adoption of hydrogen technology. In addition, tough environmental laws over Greenhouse Gas emissions act as a stimulus for the greater adoption of zero-emission vehicles like hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which increase demand for hydrogen fuel stations.\n\n\n\nBesides, feasibility and efficiency characteristics of the deployment of hydrogen fueling stations exist due to numerous technological developments and innovations in hydrogen production, storage, and refueling technologies in North America. Subsequently, many major corporations and automakers are also significantly investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology and relevant infrastructure, hastening the development and deployment of hydrogen fueling stations in the region. On the whole, with increasing consumer and corporate demand - energized by environmental awareness and corporate sustainability goals - the need for a comprehensive hydrogen refueling network comes to the fore.\n\n\n\nKey Benefits of Buying the Report\n\nIncreasing emphasis on net zero emissions and supporting government regulations are just a few of the primary drivers propelling the hydrogen fueling stations market. Regulatory and legislative uncertainties, as well as costly initial capital expenditure, limit the market's expansion. The ongoing energy shift to reduce carbon emissions is likely to provide attractive prospects for hydrogen fueling station market participants.\n\nProduct Development/ Innovation: The hydrogen fueling station market is seeing substantial product development and innovation, driven by rising environmental concerns. Companies are investing in improved hydrogen fueling station manufacturing technology.\n\nMarket Development: Nel ASA has received a purchase order from Alperia Greenpower SRL for hydrogen fueling equipment to be installed in Italy. This marks Nel's first H2Station in Italy, highlighting the company's growing footprint in Europe and its role in advancing hydrogen infrastructure. The hydrogen fueling station will primarily be built for the 2026 Winter Olympics to fuel vehicles for the transfer between the Olympic sports facilities. The contract has a total value of around EUR 3.8 million (USD 4.2 million) and includes a 2-year service and maintenance contract. The station is scheduled to be operational in the second half of 2025.\n\nMarket Diversification: Air Liquide has completed the Motomiya Interchange Hydrogen Station in Fukushima Prefecture, designed for large commercial vehicles and scheduled to operate 24/7. This station will support hydrogen mobility and the deployment of 60 fuel cell trucks in the region. It is an off-site station where hydrogen is transported from external sources, including renewable energy-based hydrogen. The project is part of a collaboration between Air Liquide, ITOCHU Corporation, and ITOCHU ENEX, supported by METI and Fukushima Prefecture.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 300 Forecast Period 2024 - 2030 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $0.5 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2030 $1.8 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 23.8% Regions Covered Global\n\n\n\nCompanies Featured\n\nAir Liquide\n\nNel Asa\n\nLinde PLC\n\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nHydrogen Refueling Solutions\n\nMaximator Hydrogen GmbH\n\nMcphy Energy SA\n\nIwatani Corporation\n\nIngersoll Rand\n\nChart Industries\n\nPeric Hydrogen Technologies Co.

Semiconductor manufacturing uses more than 150 chemicals and over 30 gases and minerals in the production processes. In fact, the success of chip manufacturing depends upon the reliability, safety and innovation of these chemicals and gases.\"Merck is looking to set up a plant to manufacture specialty chemicals here in India,\" said a person aware of the plans of the German company. \"They are in talks with the government to establish a chemical plant for semiconductors, which could mean investment to the tune of around $300-500 million. The site for the plant has not been finalised yet.\"Specialty gases firm Linde is planning to put up plants for high purity gasses, this person said.\"As a leading global industrial gases and engineering company, Linde is an essential supplier to the semiconductor industry,\" Linde said in a statement to ET. \"Linde actively supports investments in this critical sector and is committed to supporting its growth in India.\"Merck, on its part, said it has been monitoring semiconductor manufacturing developments in India for the past couple of years.\"We believe that India is becoming an increasingly important partner in the global semiconductor ecosystem,\" the company said in a statement to ET. \"However, at this time it is too early to talk about concrete investment numbers in India. We continue to closely follow opportunities that align with our strategic goals.\"Specialty chemicals and gases enable precise control over the deposition and removal of materials on silicon wafers. They help perform critical tasks like etching, doping, cleaning and depositing layers, all the while maintaining the necessary ultra-high purity levels required for the tiny and sensitive components in semiconductors.Navin Bishnoi, country head at semiconductor company Marvell India , underscored the importance of such players coming in. He said it was crucial as without them, the ecosystem would not be complete.\"Ancillary companies need to come and set up base in India. The companies that provide gases, chemicals, the different wafers, tools, equipment and everything else,\u201d Bishnoi said. \u201cEarlier, these companies existed in Taiwan as the ancillary companies to enable the manufacturing there, and now with India building its own fab, they are slowly coming in here.\"Neil Shah, vice president-research at Counterpoint Research, said there were certain aspects that must be kept in mind.\"For bulk gases and specialty gases, it is critical to maintain uninterrupted supply,\" Shah said. \"Suppliers should be at least within 40 kms of the fab for timely and disruption-free supplies. So, having local plants would be very important.\"Linde already has a good base in India and supplies to multiple industries including India's only fab, the Semi-Conductor Laboratory in Mohali, he said. For business continuity and to get new fab clients, and not lose out to Linde or Merck, competitors such as Korea Gases and Taiyo Nippon Sanso will have to be more aggressive in India, he said.",

            "content": "Jurisdictional battles generated by the dispute between Ruschemalliance LLC (\"RCA\") and entities within Linde GmbH's group (\"Linde\") arising from the termination of the EPC contract between RCA and Linde show no signs of abating. The contest between competing injunctions issued by Russian and English courts has reached a new stage, and RCA's efforts to enforce against Linde\u2019s assets, and Linde\u2019s attempts to counter such enforcement, are in full swing.\n\nRCA's enforcement action in Kazakhstan and Linde's injunction application against RCA in the Dutch courts (discussed below) demonstrate how these opposing parties have sought to protect their interests in courts outside of Russia. While the outcomes of these and other similar proceedings will be significant, they may not necessarily determine the eventual commercial fallout from the disputes. Ultimately, the practical effect of various court rulings may be determined largely by the location of the parties' respective assets, and not just by the prospects of enforcing in other jurisdictions the rulings issued by Russian Courts in disregard of arbitration agreements.\n\nIn this Part 6 we provide an overview of recent proceedings arising from the dispute between RCA and Linde and summarise the current state of play in this rapidly developing multi-jurisdictional tussle.\n\nRCA V. LINDE DISPUTE AND RELATED PROCEEDINGS IN THE ENGLISH COURT\n\nThe dispute between RCA and Linde has triggered a series of related international proceedings before state courts and arbitral tribunals. The facts of the case, discussed in more detail in our previous Legal Update, can be summarised as follows:\n\nIn 2021, RCA entered into EPC contracts with Linde and another contractor for the construction of LNG facilities in Russia. The EPC contracts were governed by English law and contained an arbitration agreement providing for Hong Kong-seated arbitration. UniCredit, Bayerische Landesbank and other banks (the \" Banks \") provided on-demand bonds in favour of RCA guaranteeing the performance of the EPC contracts. The bonds were governed by English law and provided for disputes to be resolved by arbitration seated in Paris.\n\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU extended sanctions on Russia and Russian entities, and Linde was informed by the German government that it could not continue with the project. In response, RCA sought to terminate the EPC contracts, made calls on the bonds and subsequently issued separate proceedings in the Russian courts against Linde under the EPC contract and against the Banks under the bonds, notwithstanding the arbitration agreements.\n\nRCA commenced litigation in Russia relying on the amendments to the Arbitrazh (Commercial) Procedure Code introduced in 2020 which allow Russian courts to assert exclusive jurisdiction even where a dispute is subject to an arbitration/non-Russian jurisdiction agreement, if such an agreement is deemed inoperable because the Russian party may face obstacles to access to justice in the contractually agreed forum. For a discussion on the 2020 amendments to the Arbitrazh Procedure Code please see Part 4 of this Series .\n\nProceedings then began outside of Russia. The Banks applied to the English court for anti-suit injunctions to restrain RCA from initiating or maintaining its suits in Russia in breach of applicable arbitration agreements. On appeal, the UK Supreme Court upheld UniCredit's permanent injunction against RCA in April 2024. In June 2024, Bayerische Landesbank obtained similar relief from the English Commercial Court which followed the approach in UniCredit\u2019s injunction proceedings. In sum, all five banks succeeded in their injunction applications.\n\nHowever, undeterred by the injunctions issued by the English court, RCA has maintained existing proceedings in Russia and initiated new ones, including outside Russia, in relation to the same matter. The key recent developments are described below, in chronological order.\n\nRCA'S ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS IN KAZAKHSTAN\n\nHaving obtained a favourable judgment against Linde in Russia, RCA sought to enforce it in Kazakhstan against the assets of two Linde entities \u2013 Linde Holdings Netherlands No. 3 B.V. (\"Linde No. 3\") and Linde UK Holdings No. 2 Limited (\"Linde No. 2\"). The assets targeted by RCA consisted of the participation interests Linde No. 2 and Linde No. 3 held in a Kazakh-registered Linde Gas Kazakhstan LLP. Kazakhstan is not on Russia's list1 of \u2018unfriendly\u2019 states, and this could be one of the factors why this jurisdiction was chosen to enforce the judgment outside of Russia.\n\nRCA's application for enforcement was rejected by the Kazakhstan court on 26 August 2024 (case no. 7527-24-00-00-2m/528). In its judgment dismissing RCA's suit, the court referred to the applicable local rules which provide, inter alia, that enforcement proceedings should be initiated at the location of the relevant legal entity. If the judgment debtor's location is unknown, the judgment can be enforced at the location of the debtor's property. The court held that RCA knew the location (place of registration) of Linde No. 2 and Linde No. 3 (undisputed by RCA) and rejected the enforcement application on the basis that Linde No. 2 and Linde No. 3 were not located within Kazakhstan.\n\nThe court did not indicate how it might have approached the enforcement of the relevant judgment had the respondent entities been established in Kazakhstan, which remains an open question. The decision to refuse enforcement, and the reasoning, was subsequently upheld on appeal on 18 October 2024.\n\nLINDE NO 3'S ANTI-SUIT INJUNCTION APPLICATION IN THE NETHERLANDS\n\nA Dutch-registered company within the Linde group, Linde No. 3, issued proceedings in the Netherlands against RCA to counteract the Russian proceedings and RCA's enforcement of the Russian judgment (the \"Dutch Action\" - case no. C/10/688624/KG ZA 24-1037). Linde No. 3 sought an injunction against RCA initiating any proceedings concerning the relevant contracts and an order that RCA terminates any proceedings already pending. Linde No. 3 also requested the court to issue an order prohibiting enforcement against it and to impose penalties on RCA for any breaches of the court orders. RCA responded by promptly applying for an injunction in the Russian courts to enjoin Linde No. 3 from pursuing the Dutch Action (case no. \u041056-118993/2024).\n\nThe Dutch court dismissed Linde No. 3's application for lack of jurisdiction. In its 2 January 2025 judgment, the court held that, as RCA was not established in the Netherlands, the jurisdiction of Dutch courts could not be based on the respondent's domicile. Considering whether jurisdiction could be established on the basis of obligations arising from tort where the damaging event occurred or could occur in the Netherlands, the court noted that the place of the alleged damaging event was not the Netherlands, but Russia (RCA's proceedings against Linde) and Kazakhstan (RCA's enforcement proceedings against, inter alia, Linde No. 3). It also rejected the argument that Linde No. 3's costs of pursuing the injunction in Dutch courts constituted the requisite damage that occurred in the Netherlands.\n\nSimilar to the Kazakh court, the Dutch court also did not comment on whether, had jurisdiction been established, Linder No. 3's application could have been successful on the merits.\n\nAPPLICATIONS BY THE BANKS TO WITHDRAW ANTI-SUIT INJUNCTIONS\n\nIt was recently reported that:\n\nSome of the Banks have returned to the English courts to lift the injunctions against RCA. UniCredit, which fought a long legal battle to obtain a permanent anti-suit injunction culminating in a Supreme Court victory, applied to the Court of Appeal to reverse the measure. On 11 February 2025 the Court of Appeal discharged UniCredit\u2019s injunction against RCA.\n\nUniCredit had no choice but to withdraw the English injunction , as otherwise it would face a fine of EUR 250 million being imposed by Russian courts due to a competing injunction obtained by RCA in Russia which ordered UniCredit, inter alia, to cancel the injunction issued by English courts. UniCredit claimed that it has been practically impossible to enforce the English injunction since RCA does not have assets outside Russia. Maintaining the injunction, on the other hand, carried a real risk of significantly increasing UniCredit's liabilities in Russia which could be enforced against UniCredit's assets in that jurisdiction.\n\nUniCredit has announced that some of the other Banks have already either withdrawn their injunction or submitted a similar application to cancel the injunction against RCA.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nThe tangle of proceedings that emanated from the original RCA v. Linde dispute illustrates the wide-ranging legal and commercial consequences that can follow high-impact events, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of international sanctions. Just a single LNG project undertaken by RCA involves a suite of contracts prone to disruption and a multitude of parties that can be drawn into protracted legal proceedings with unpredictable outcomes. RCA v. Linde underscores the importance of a careful prospective assessment of potential exposures and strategic risk mitigation even against unprecedented events. Once the risk materialises, the scope for taking effective legal action to protect a business and/or assets may be limited depending on where they are located at the time.\n\nThese recent developments are also a timely reminder that it may be challenging to ensure that decisions taken by courts of one country can be effective against a party in another country. Cross-border enforcement can present many obstacles, ranging from differing jurisdictional rules to geopolitical tensions. Nevertheless, an injunction backed by a fine and/or potential criminal liability can in some circumstances be a very effective tool to put pressure on opponents. International businesses would, therefore, be well advised to carefully (re)appraise their exposures and potential legal vulnerabilities with respect to the increasingly volatile and unpredictable international geopolitical environment.\n\nMayer Brown\u2019s diverse and multi-office international arbitration team is well-equipped to navigate these complex matters and provide strategic advice to ensure the best outcome in contentious matters.

            "content": "Some Linde plc ( ) shareholders may be a little concerned to see that the Lead Independent Director, Robert Wood, recently sold a substantial US$1.3m worth of stock at a price of US$456 per share. That sale reduced their total holding by 17% which is hardly insignificant, but far from the worst we've seen.\n\nLinde Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, John Panikar, for US$4.6m worth of shares, at about US$463 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$461. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).\n\nIn total, Linde insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this free\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Linde insiders own about US$370m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Linde Insiders?\n\nThe insider sales have outweighed the insider buying, at Linde, in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But since Linde is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Linde. While conducting our analysis, we found that Linde has and it would be unwise to ignore them.\n\nOf course Linde may not be the best stock to buy.

The company reported a 2% year-over-year increase in Q4 revenue to $8.3 billion and a 13% increase in adjusted EPS, excluding foreign exchange impacts. Despite facing a 4% foreign exchange headwind due to a stronger U.S. dollar, Linde remains optimistic about future EPS growth driven by strategic capital allocations and management actions. Analysts have adjusted their price targets based on these developments: Mizuho lowered its price target for Linde citing larger-than-expected currency headwinds in 2025, while BMO Capital raised its target, attributing the increase to Linde\u2019s accelerating pricing, growing backlog, and potential for long-term upside amid competitor distractions.\n\nMore about Linde\n\nYTD Price Performance: 11.24%\n\nAverage Trading Volume: 2,295,838\n\nTechnical Sentiment Consensus Rating: Strong Sell\n\nCurrent Market Cap: $219.4B\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "One thing we could say about the analysts on Linde India Limited ( ) - they aren't optimistic, having just made a major negative revision to their near-term (statutory) forecasts for the organization. Both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates were cut sharply as the analysts factored in the latest outlook for the business, concluding that they were too optimistic previously.\n\nFollowing the downgrade, the most recent consensus for Linde India from its two analysts is for revenues of \u20b938b in 2026 which, if met, would be a huge 50% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are presumed to surge 42% to \u20b973.55. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of \u20b943b and earnings per share (EPS) of \u20b983.32 in 2026. Indeed, we can see that the analysts are a lot more bearish about Linde India's prospects, administering a measurable cut to revenue estimates and slashing their EPS estimates to boot.\n\nThe consensus price target fell 8.7% to \u20b97,206, with the weaker earnings outlook clearly leading analyst valuation estimates.\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. It's clear from the latest estimates that Linde India's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 38% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2026 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 13% p.a. over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 13% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Linde India to grow faster than the wider industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that analysts cut their earnings per share estimates, expecting a clear decline in business conditions. While analysts did downgrade their revenue estimates, these forecasts still imply revenues will perform better than the wider market. Given the scope of the downgrades, it would not be a surprise to see the market become more wary of the business.\n\nStill, the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

The report runs an in-depth analysis of market trends, key players, and future opportunities. The helium market analysis focuses on an array of industrial applications that are expected to determine the market strength in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor More Information and To Stay Updated on The Latest Developments in The Helium Market, Download The Sample Pages: https://www.theinsightpartners.com/sample/TIPRE00004510/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of Report Findings\n\nMarket Growth: The helium market is expected to reach US$ 7.25 billion by 2031 from US$ 4.62 billion in 2023; it is anticipated to record a CAGR of 5.8% during the forecast period. Helium is an odorless and colorless nonrenewable resource usually recovered from natural gas deposits. It finds application in various end-use industries including aerospace, automotive, electronics and semiconductors, healthcare, power, welding and metal fabrication, and recreation/events. For instance, in aerospace, helium is used to purge hydrogen systems as a cryogenic agent and pressurizing agent for flight and ground fluid systems.\n\nHigh Demand for Helium from Healthcare Industries: The healthcare sector is one of the primary end users of helium. Helium plays an important role in medical imaging, particularly in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. It acts as a cooling agent for superconducting magnets that are essential for the machine's function. Helium also finds significant applications in cryogenics, wherein its extremely low temperature is utilized to preserve biological samples. The element is also employed in medical equipment such as lung ventilators, where a mix of oxygen and helium aids patients suffering from respiratory issues by reducing the density of the gas mixture.\n\nStrong Growth of Semiconductors Industry: As per the Semiconductor Industry Association, global semiconductor sales rose from US$ 45.6 billion in November 2022 to US$ 48.0 billion in November 2023. The sales increased at a year-on-year rate of 7.1% in Asia Pacific and other regions, and by 5.6% in Europe. Furthermore, China registered a year-on-year surge in the sales of semiconductors at 7.6% in 2022. According to the customs data of China, the import value of chipmaking tools required for the production of silicon wafers, integrated circuits, and flat-panel displays reached US$ 4.3 billion in October 2023. In April 2023, 101 listed companies in the semiconductor sector in China accounted for a total revenue of US$ 63.2 billion in 2022, recording a rise of 10% from 2021.",

Image: Linde\n\nFonterra might not be a household name for all Australians, but you\u2019re likely more familiar with the company than you think.\n\nThis dairy co-operative, owned by thousands of farming families across New Zealand, supplies ingredients included in many food products around the world. In Australia, its portfolio includes well-known brands such as Mainland, Western Star, Perfect Italiano, Bega and NZMP.\n\nThe co-op produces a range of foodstuffs from milk, butter, whole milk powders, cheese, cream cheese and Ultra High Temperature (UHT) products, through to ingredients used in paediatric, medical and active living commodities such as probiotics, advanced proteins, and hydrolysates. Shipping to more than 140 countries globally, the co-op moves approximately 300,000 tonnes of product during its peak months \u2013 equating to about 160,000 containers a year, or one shipping container filled every three minutes.\n\nWhen Fonterra chose to partner with Linde Material Handling Australia in 2009, it was around the same time the co-op was established. Fonterra\u2019s decision was largely influenced by the fact that many dairy organisations within the co-op were already using Linde forklifts, which had proven to be a great choice for the industry.\n\nWhat started out as a supplier relationship has since evolved into a true partnership, where both companies collaborate to improve efficiency and productivity while still maintaining high safety standards. \u201cWhenever Fonterra looks to innovate, especially in the MHE sphere, but not exclusively, they often turn to us,\u201d says Allan Spackman, Technical Solutions Manager at Linde.\n\n\u201cThey were the first customer in the ANZ region to take on Lithium-ION (Li-ION) from Linde, and they\u2019re now one of our biggest Li-ION customers in this region.\n\n\u201cThey were our first Linde Automation customer, taking in Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to their Darfield site, and they were our first Linde:Connect Charger customer in this region, too.\u201d\n\nFonterra, like Linde, are innovators.\n\n\u201cAt Linde we pride ourselves as being innovators in our industry, and Fonterra very much align with that,\u201d says Allan. \u201cAn example of their innovative spirit is they possess the world\u2019s biggest powdered milk dryer at their Darfield site.\n\n\u201cSo, when we present a new innovation to Fonterra, if it has value to them, and offers something they\u2019ve never had before, they\u2019re often open to partnering with us and exploring its potential.\u201d\n\nFonterra manages 27 distribution centres integrated with manufacturing facilities, along with four standalone large distribution centres across New Zealand \u2013 all of which look after exporting their products to the world.\n\nDarfield, one of Fonterra\u2019s newest facilities, mainly focuses on producing whole milk powder and cream cheese. Meanwhile, Clandeboye, one of Fonterra\u2019s founding sites, produces a diverse range of products, including whole milk powder, butter, and cheese \u2013 with a particular focus on mozzarella. As the largest producer of natural mozzarella in the Southern Hemisphere, Clandeboye provides enough mozzarella to top an 500 million pizzas annually.\n\n\u201cLinde is incredibly important to Fonterra. It\u2019s been a partnership we\u2019ve had for over 15 years,\u201d says Richard Tyson, General Manager NZ Distribution Centres Fonterra, New Zealand.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve supported us in our sustainability journey of wanting to decrease emissions by 50.4 per cent by 2030 and transitioning our forklift fleet to electric helps to achieve this, as well as playing a massive role in our automation strategy.\u201d\n\nFonterra has ambitious plans for automation across its distribution centres, and Linde has a key role in supporting these efforts.\n\n\u201cLinde has been integral in supporting our automation journey at Fonterra; they supported us in bringing our first automation to Darfield \u2013 where we\u2019ve had huge success \u2013 and we very much look forward to rolling automation out to our other sites,\u201d says Richard.\n\nSpreading efficiency: automating cream cheese distribution\n\nIn 2018, while constructing its cream cheese factory at the Darfield site, Fonterra sought a supplier for automated forklifts to operate in the palletising area. Given its strong partnership with Linde, it sought guidance to identify the best solution.\n\nThe new factory introduced two distinct work zones:\n\nInside the factory: A hygiene control zone where food processing takes place that Fonterra refers to as \u2018over the red line\u2019. This is where before any workers enter, they must remove their outside clothes and dress in gear that can only be used inside the factory including sanitised overalls, hair and beard nets, glasses, boots and gloves.\n\nIn the distribution centre: This is separate to the factory, where palletising of the cream cheese takes place, and is then transported to the cold store section of their warehouse for distribution.\n\nFonterra, already familiar with Linde\u2019s automated solutions, was drawn to its use of SLAM navigation \u2013 Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping \u2013 an infrastructure-free way for an AGV to navigate. It also wanted to explore AGVs that were built on standard Linde trucks.\n\n\u201cThey were very happy with the Linde product they had in all of their manual operations and didn\u2019t see any reason that couldn\u2019t translate into their automated operations as well,\u201d says Allan.\n\nMatt Smith, Fonterra Plant Manager \u2013 Darfield Cream Cheese, explained the company\u2019s decision to partner with Linde.\n\n\u201cWe valued our existing relationship and the AGV solution that directly addressed our need to minimise operators crossing the red line.\u201d\n\nFor a worker to transport the cream cheese from the palletising area to the cold store, it would involve:\n\n\u201cCrossing the red line\u201d i.e. removing all of their sanitised gear and changing into their outside clothes.\n\nWalking 100m to the distribution centre.\n\nDriving the pallet from the palletising area, 250m down the warehouse to the cold store section.\n\nDriving the forklift 250m back to the palletising area.\n\nWalking the 100m back to the factory.\n\n\u201cCrossing the red line\u201d again i.e. changing into a new set of sanitised PPE, and then going back into the factory to continue with their quality checks.\n\nThis process, repeated 80-120 times a day, was inefficient and disrupted quality checks.\n\nFonterra accepted Linde\u2019s recommendation to install two AGVs, which proved the ideal solution. By managing the cream cheese transport to the cold store, the AGVs saved time, enabling workers to focus on critical quality checks and maintaining the smooth operation of the process line.\n\nSince their installation five years ago, the two AGVs have collectively logged more than 20,000 hours driving pallets back and forth \u2013 which has saved Fonterra\u2019s employees from having to do it.\n\n\u201cThe AGVs are great from a productivity and safety point of view,\u201d says Matt.\n\n\u201cI know the task is getting done, and I know the products are being put away safely every day in the cold store,\n\nwhich means I don\u2019t have to worry about my operators interacting with forklifts as much.\u201d\n\nBruce Hansen, Fonterra National Fleet Manager \u2013 Manufacturing and Supply Chain, New Zealand says the relationship has been advantageous to everyone involved.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of support and collaboration between Fonterra, Linde and third-party suppliers to get the right outcomes for the business and keep the uptime of our AGVs as high\n\nas possible,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, the support we\u2019ve received from Linde has been exceptional.\n\n\u201cThe AGVs have become a welcome addition to the Fonterra family and are typically the highlight of any\n\nplant tour.\u201d\n\nWorking on this project with Fonterra, Linde understood how critical it was for workers to avoid crossing the red line to deal with any AGV errors.\n\n\u201cEvery half a per cent of error reduction we achieved throughout the commissioning process made a huge difference to how Fonterra workers get through their day,\u201dsays Allan.\n\n\u201cWe use a statistical program to inform us how effective our AGVs are, and by the time the machines were fully commissioned, we found that their technical uptime rate was among the best across all Linde\u2019s AGVs globally.\u201d\n\nToday, Fonterra\u2019s AGVs are now used as a benchmark for other AGV projects around the globe.\n\nPowering up with Linde: Connect Charger\n\nThe first rollout of the Linde:Connect Charger, a new charge management system from Linde, took place in early 2024 at Fonterra\u2019s Clandeboye site.\n\nThis was a trial for Fonterra to see if it\u2019s a viable solution that they could roll out to its other sites, and so far, things are looking good according to Bruce.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen so far is really positive, and it\u2019s very likely we\u2019ll be installing quite a few more systems in the near future,\u201d he says.\n\nPower limitations at site proved challenging for Fonterra\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cMany distribution centres were originally built for minimal power use, making electric charging station installations challenging,\u201d says Bruce. \u201cLinde:Connect Charger helps us sidestep significant infrastructure upgrade costs.\u201d\n\nThrough regular discussions with Linde, Fonterra identified the opportunity to trial new technology that could address the issue.\n\nThe system connects multiple charging stations, enabling them to communicate and prioritise which machines get charged first, or the fastest, by intelligently allocating the right amount of power to each station. For example, if three machines require simultaneous charging, the charger will identify each truck\u2019s requirements, determining which one needs a faster charge, and which one can charge\n\nmore gradually.\n\n\u201cHaving the option to run the Linde:Connect Charger allows us to charge the fleet efficiently and effectively, and we didn\u2019t have to spend a lot of money to install more electrical infrastructure or upgrade what we had in order to do it,\u201d says Bruce.\n\n\u201cIt turned out to be a perfect fit for our application.\u201d\n\nFonterra\u2019s decision followed thorough research, assessing: required operational uptime; charging time availability; and electrical capacity to support uninterrupted fleet operation.\n\nThe warehouse section where the system was installed faced limited power supply.\n\nThis solution allowed Fonterra to utilise their existing infrastructure, avoiding costly upgrades. Additionally, it provides data logging, enabling Fonterra to monitor charging schedules and prioritise key machines.\n\nThe trial at the Clandeboye site will guide potential rollouts across Fonterra\u2019s 26 other sites.\n\nContinuing a Legendairy Partnership\n\nFonterra\u2019s Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) model considers many factors including energy consumption and maintenance costs to help the co-op determine which brand fits best for their application.\n\n\u201cBased on working with other MHE brands in the past, we know that we\u2019d rather spend a bit more money up front on a product that is right for us, and that\u2019s a Linde,\u201d says Bruce.\n\n\u201cLinde forklifts and warehouse trucks are very well built with great reliability. For Fonterra, we view Linde as the best brand in the market for safety, technology, and ergonomics \u2013 our operators love our Lindes. We know and trust the brand, so it\u2019s a no-brainer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a great relationship with the many staff I deal with at Linde.\n\n\u201cEvery time I have an issue or challenge, there\u2019s always a solution being offered on the other end, and that\u2019s priceless in my opinion.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why Linde forklifts are such a seamless fit for Fonterra, Bruce explained why.\n\n\u201cWe own our whole fleet, so cost of ownership is a key aspect to selecting the right product for our application,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe do try other brands on odd occasions to compare what\u2019s on the market, see how they perform, and ensure that we\u2019re getting the best.\n\n\u201cAnd time and time again we prove that Linde is top of the bunch, where the reliability and the performance is there.\n\n\u201cYou just get so much more flexibility, longevity and reliability with a Linde, and that\u2019s what keeps our operations going so smoothly.\u201d\n\nAcross its 27 distribution centres, Fonterra operates a fleet of more than 600 machines, 60 per cent of which are now electric.\n\n\u201cThe strong relationship we have with Linde opens up a lot of opportunities for us to explore automation and other new technologies coming through, particularly around safety,\u201d says Bruce.\n\n\u201cWe explore and collaborate together to see where these new solutions can fit into our business.\n\n\u201cI also find it\u2019s pretty special for us that we get to access new and exciting technology that\u2019s coming onto the scene, but not yet publicly released.\u201d\n\nReferring to the partnership Fonterra has with Linde, Richard was effusive.\n\n\u201cLinde has been awesome for us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey really partner with us; they evolve with us and it\u2019s a relationship we absolutely see continuing on into the future.\u201d",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Safest Dividend Stocks in the UK. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) stands against other safest dividend stocks in the UK.\n\nIn recent years, investors have increasingly shifted away from UK equities, favoring global stocks, particularly high-growth sectors like US technology. The UK stock market is shrinking at its fastest pace in over a decade, largely due to a wave of takeovers involving London-listed companies. Bloomberg data showed that around 45 firms have been delisted from the London market in 2024 through mergers and acquisitions, reflecting a 10% rise from last year\u2019s total. This marks the highest level of delistings since 2010. At the same time, the value of deals involving UK companies has climbed 81% this year, surpassing $160 billion.\n\nOver the last ten years, the British index has delivered an annual total return of 6%, significantly lagging behind the 13% return of the broader US market. Analysts attribute this weaker performance to sluggish earnings growth, political uncertainty within the UK, and the lack of a dominant technology sector. However, a key factor has been the sharp drop in valuations as investors have increasingly moved away from UK stocks. According to Goldman Sachs, the issue is not a lack of foreign investor interest\u2014who currently account for roughly two-thirds of the UK market capitalization\u2014but rather the low engagement of domestic investors in UK equities.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nThat said, several factors seem to be contributing to a shift in investor sentiment. In November 2024, UK equity funds saw inflows after more than three years of continuous monthly withdrawals and a large sell-off leading up to the Budget. According to data from Calastone, retail investors invested a net \u00a3317 million into UK-focused stock funds that month. This marks a significant change, halting a streak of 41 months of net outflows, during which over \u00a325 billion had been pulled from these funds since May 2021.\n\nAnalysts also believe that the UK stock market may be on the verge of recovery, although the exact timing and pace of this shift are unclear. In this context, dividend stocks are crucial. Focusing on stocks with growing dividends can offer stability and consistency across different market conditions. These stocks also provide long-term growth potential, compounding returns as share prices recover. The UK market offers some of the highest dividend yields among major markets, with the \u201cFootsie\u201d yielding 3.46%, and the FTSE 250 offering slightly lower but still attractive yields. This setup enables investors to focus on high-growth areas, like smaller companies, while enjoying the benefit of increasing dividends. According to BlackRock, UK market dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, roughly in line with long-term inflation. Companies with growing dividends typically have strong cash flows, allowing them to increase payouts over time.\n\nJanus Henderson\u2019s 2023 annual dividend report highlighted a significant increase in dividend growth, revealing that the UK paid out roughly $86 billion in dividends last year, up from $63.1 billion in 2020. Looking ahead, the UK\u2019s stock market index is projected to distribute about \u00a383.6 billion in dividends in 2025, marking a 6.5% rise from the \u00a378.5 billion expected in 2024.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 to find FTSE stocks that are also traded on US exchanges. Our focus was on companies that have strong dividend policies and consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment toward them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nLinde plc (NASDAQ:LIN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 63\n\nLinde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) is an international chemical company that supplies various gases to industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, energy, food and beverage, chemicals, and electronics. The company delivered solid results in 2024, securing more than 59 small on-site contracts for clean energy supply and committing $2 billion to the DOW (Canada) project for low-carbon (blue) hydrogen production. The company invested a total of $4.8 billion in its operations. Annual sales reached $33 million, slightly up from $32 million in 2023, while the operating margin improved to 29.5%, marking a 190-basis-point increase from the previous year.\n\nIn 2024, Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) reported a robust operating cash flow of $9.4 billion. The company allocated $4.5 billion toward capital expenditures and distributed $7.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, after accounting for new issuances. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.39 per share for a dividend yield of 1.21%, as of February 10. It is one of the best FTSE dividend stocks on our list as the company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 31 consecutive years.\n\nDriven by the growing demand for clean energy, particularly from the expanding electronics and EV battery markets, Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) expects a promising future as a key player in the environmental and clean energy sectors. The company remains dedicated to sustainability, investing heavily in clean energy and decarbonization initiatives. With strong financial results and an optimistic market outlook, Linde continues to solidify its position as a leader in the industrial gas industry.\n\nOverall, LIN ranks 1st on our list of safest dividend stocks in the UK. While we acknowledge the potential for LIN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LIN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Amidst a tumultuous backdrop where UK equities see investors fleeing to global markets, Linde quietly exerts its dominance.

This industrial giant, known for its indispensability in industries ranging from healthcare to electronics, has showcased remarkable resilience. With more than 59 contracts clinched for clean energy supply in 2024 and substantial investments like the $2 billion commitment to a low-carbon hydrogen project, the company cements itself as a leader in sustainability.\n\nLinde\u2019s commitment to shareholders is unwavering, with an enviable track record of 31 years of consecutive dividend growth. As of February 2024, its quarterly payout stands at $1.39 per share. While its dividend yield may appear modest at 1.21%, it represents robust and reliable returns amid uncertain times. Investors looking for a cushion against market turbulence and looming uncertainties might find solace in Linde\u2019s financial fortitude and steady dividend strategy.\n\nLinde\u2019s focus on clean energy and decarbonization underlines its commitment to sustainability, positioning it as an appealing prospect in a shifting market.

While the British market faces a significant shift towards global equities\u2014losing 45 companies in 2024\u2014Linde has proven to be a stable and promising option for investors. Known for its strategic involvement in industries like healthcare and electronics, Linde continues to demonstrate its resilience and commitment to sustainability.\n\nKey Features and Innovations of Linde plc\n\nLinde plc is not just an ordinary industrial giant; it\u2019s a leader in innovation, particularly in clean energy and decarbonization efforts. Some of its notable moves include:\n\n\u2013 Sustainability Initiatives: A $2 billion investment in low-carbon hydrogen projects highlights Linde\u2019s strategic commitment to sustainability.\n\n\u2013 Clean Energy Contracts: Secured over 59 contracts in 2024, strengthening its role in clean energy supply.\n\n\u2013 Dividend Growth: Linde boasts 31 years of consecutive dividend growth, with a current quarterly payout of $1.39 per share despite a modest yield of 1.21%.\n\nPros and Cons of Investing in Linde plc\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Resilience: Linde has shown robust stability amidst global uncertainties.\n\n\u2013 Sustainability Focus: A strong pivot towards clean energy makes Linde a forward-thinking investment.\n\n\u2013 Reliable Dividends: Investors enjoy consistent dividend growth.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Modest Yield: The dividend yield of 1.21% might not attract those seeking higher immediate returns.\n\n\u2013 Exclusion from Fast-Growth Tech: Linde\u2019s focus is more industrial and sustainability-based, missing out on the rapid tech sector growth.\n\nMarket Analysis and Predictions\n\nWith a shifting landscape and doubts around domestic UK equities, Linde\u2019s strategic moves in clean energy and sustainability set it up as a promising stock. As global interest in hydrogen and clean technologies grows, Linde is positioned for sustained growth, making it appealing for investors seeking dependable dividend income amidst market uncertainty.\n\nThe Competitive Edge of Linde plc\n\nWhile overshadowed by high-growth sectors like US technology, Linde\u2019s diversification across essential industries and its sustainability initiatives offer a competitive edge. This positioning is especially significant as more investors prioritize ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) considerations.\n\nSecurity and Risk Assessment\n\nInvesting in Linde carries standard risks associated with industrial stocks, such as supply chain disruptions or regulatory changes.

            "content": "The baseball team looks to improve off a strong showing in 2024. Collegian stock photo.\n\nNHU-HAN BUI | STAFF REPORTER | hbui@butler.edu\n\nAfter ending the 2024 season with a 20-35 record, the Butler baseball team is looking for their first winning season since 2018. The team is coming off a year that saw them break school records for most home runs and total bases in a single season.\n\nFirst pitch for the Bulldogs will come against Tarleton State on Feb. 14. They then head to Norfolk State from Feb. 21-23 before their first home game against Bowling Green on Feb. 25.\n\nButler is led by head coach Blake Beemer, who is entering his third year in charge. After setting a school record for most losses in his first year, the team bounced back by winning eight more games the following year.\n\nBeemer hopes that his growth will show through the players\u2019 attitudes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve grown as a coach year-to-year, and my hope [for this season] is to put our guys in better positions,\u201d Beemer said. \u201cI think they feed off my energy, and my hope is that if I can be a more consistent and level-headed leader, they\u2019ll be consistent [and] level-headed players. We had a lot of growing pains last year, but hopefully, all of those will pay off as we get going.\u201d\n\nAfter losing key players such as shortstop Carter Dorighi, outfielder Joey Urban and infielder Kade Lewis to the MLB Draft and transfer portal over the offseason, Butler added 18 new players to reinforce its roster, including eight first-years.\n\n\u201cSometimes your [first-years] have the deer-in-headlights [reaction], and your juniors and seniors don\u2019t have that,\u201d Beemer said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been around the block and just compete to the best of their ability. I think if they can just go out and do that the way they\u2019ve done all fall and winter, we\u2019re going to be in a good spot.\u201d\n\nAnother quality that new players bring to the team is a fresh mentality. Sophomore pitcher Simon Linde hopes that with the new additions, Butler can build off last year\u2019s success and start to form a winning team culture.\n\n\u201cWhat I really hope to get from [the new players] is just coming in and setting that culture of success and helping us continue to build on what we improved last year,\u201d Linde said. \u201c[I hope they] bring in more and more competitiveness to our culture and help us cultivate a good, winning personality [for] the team.\u201d\n\nEven with all the new faces in the locker room, the team has quickly grown close thanks to several team-bonding activities. Redshirt junior outfielder Jack Moroknek said the team has naturally gravitated together as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the tightest team I\u2019ve had in my four years here,\u201d Moroknek said. \u201cWe do a lot of things off the field just to be with each other. We go out, go for food, play cards, anything. We also have a team Bible study that gets together every week.\u201d\n\nWith a large first-year class, the returning players have also begun to step up into leadership roles. Although the baseball team does not have a captain, Moroknek believes there is one player who could be voted for the position.\n\n\u201cBen Whiteside [has stepped into a leadership role], for sure,\u201d Moroknek said. \u201cHe\u2019s a senior pitcher and he\u2019s been here all four years. He\u2019s really been the \u2018captain\u2019 of this team. I think he would\u2019ve been voted easily [for] our captain of the year. He is vocal, but only when he needs to be. He knows a time and a place to do things and he knows how to do it right.\u201d\n\nAlong with Whiteside, there are also other players who are less vocal but still lead in their own ways. Linde feels that more players have stepped up to represent the team\u2019s culture and lead by example.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve had a lot of guys step up into their own and maybe not be leaders [vocally], but we\u2019ve had a lot more guys lead by example this year,\u201d Linde said. \u201cA lot of people represent what they want the program to look like and how they want things to be done, and a lot of guys will end up following that, just by seeing a good example be set. We\u2019ve had a lot of good adjustments in people\u2019s mentality.\u201d\n\nButler\u2019s success during the preseason saw Moroknek earn a spot on the Preseason All-Big East Team and land at 89th on D1Baseball\u2019s Preseason Top 100 Outfielders list. Moroknek said that the honors motivate him to show that he deserves those spots.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s nice to get those honors, but at the end of the day they are preseason rankings for a reason, so I think that\u2019s what keeps me going,\u201d Moroknek said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have it in the back of your mind like, \u2018Hey, you are recognized as a good player,\u2019 but if you\u2019re not going to perform then no one\u2019s really going to care at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nA tight-knit team gives the Bulldogs confidence that they can build off their success from last season. Although Butler has seen lots of change over the past year, its end goal remains the same.\n\n\u201cThe goal is the same as every year,\u201d Beemer said. \u201cWe want to make it to Brasco Park [and] be in the top half of the conference in the Big East so [that] we have a chance to play for regional. I think the only way to do that is to take it one game at a time and one pitch at a time. If we can stay in the moment, we\u2019re going to control our destiny at the end of the year.\u201d",

            "content": "The arts resources of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology now include the school\u2019s first building designed for the study and performance of music.\n\nThe Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building, behind the Kresge Auditorium and MIT Chapel, opens to the public Saturday with a celebratory concert called \u201cSonic Jubilance\u201d \u2013 the start of a monthslong festival of 80 events across the campus, free and open to the public.\n\nCalled Artfinity \u2013 a nod to the Infinite Corridor, the east-west walkway through MIT\u2019s interconnected buildings along Memorial Drive \u2013 the festival includes concerts and visual arts programming such as outdoor projections, films, installations and exhibitions, as well as lectures and participatory workshops. Organized by the office of the arts at MIT with faculty co-leaders Marcus Thompson and professor of art, culture and technology Azra Ak\u0161amija, the celebration runs through May 2.\n\n\u201cThe extent of art-making on the MIT campus is equal to that of a major city,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that it\u2019s all right here, by people in science and technology who are absorbed in creating a new world and who also value the past, present and future of music and the arts.\u201d\n\nMore than 1,500 students enroll in MIT music classes each academic year, and more than 500 student musicians participate in one of 30 on-campus ensembles. MIT has also had its own symphony orchestra since 1884.\n\nArts patron Joyce Linde gifted the institute crucial funds for the music building in 2018. Linde, who died in March, was a longtime MIT supporter with her late husband and former MIT Corp. member Edward H. Linde \u201962.\n\nDesigned by Tokyo architectural firm Sanaa with Nagata Acoustics International, the three-volume red brick structure encompasses the Thomas Tull Concert Hall; the Beatrice and Stephen Erdely Music and Culture Space, with robust acoustic insulation and wood floors ideal for rehearsing high-volume ensembles; and the classrooms and studios of the Jae S. and Kyuho Lim Music Maker Pavilion, home to MIT\u2019s new graduate program in music technology and computation. Sanaa\u2019s co-founders were the recipients of the 2010 Pritzker Architecture Prize, often referred to as \u201carchitecture\u2019s Nobel.\u201d\n\nThe building\u2019s glass-walled lobby, where its three cubic structures converge, lets in ample natural light and views of the surrounding campus. The entrance\u2019s overhead arch echoes the curves of the nearby auditorium and chapel designed by Eero Saarinen.\n\nOutside the entrance stands Madrigal (2024), a site-specific sculpture by Sanford Biggers commissioned by MIT. The kaleidoscopic patterns of the 18-foot mixed-media piece evoke the future and past, including the African American quilting tradition, and allude to the interweaving of diverse musical lines. The school\u2019s Percent-for-Art program chose the sculpture, administered by MIT\u2019s List Visual Arts Center, which selects a new sculpture for every new building on the campus. \u201cMadrigal stands as a vibrant testament to the power of music, tradition and the enduring spirit of collaboration across time,\u201d said List director Paul Ha, calling Madrigal the latest of more than 60 works that make the campus \u201ca giant art museum.\u201d\n\n\u201cMadrigal is a beacon that leads you into the building,\u201d said Keeril Makan, music composition professor and associate dean for strategic initiatives for the School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. \u201cMultifaceted in form and also in its surface patterns, it\u2019s about not any one point of view being privileged. Your experience matters. The sculpture mirrors the intent of the Linde Music Building.\u201d\n\nIn the Linde Music Building, performers and audience members can enjoy conservatory-level acoustics. The school achieved something tech philanthropist Glenn KnicKrehm had been promising since the 1990s for Kendall Square \u2013 to build a grand concert hall called the Constellation Center. Ultimately he sold the fenced-off gravel pit in 2018 for $50.5 million after construction estimates soared out of reach to $300 million or higher during decades of research into the perfect acoustics. MIT isn\u2019t saying how much the Linde cost.\n\nMembers of the MIT community are already enjoying the building. \u201cThe ensemble rehearsal space is fantastic, with beautiful natural light,\u201d said graduate student Sabrina Drammis, co-founder of tap-dance company Pistachio Groove, \u201cand we love performing in the round in the concert hall, with its intimate stage and amazing sound.\u201d\n\nVersatility was key to those who envisioned the Linde, including Makan. \u201cIn this building, we wanted all forms of music to coexist, whether jazz, classical or music from around the world,\u201d Makan said. \u201cThis was not easy; different types of music require different conditions. But we took the time and invested in making spaces that would support all musical genres.\u201d\n\nConcerts in the round\n\nThe Thomas Tull Concert Hall can be configured for almost any style and size of performance, from a soloist to a tap dance troupe to a full jazz ensemble. There is seating for up to 390 audience members in gently rising rows encircling a central performance area.\n\n\u201cThe concert hall is only the second in the world \u2013 the first is in Berlin, the Boulez Saal \u2013 which combines seating in the round, flexible audience configurations and flexible acoustics,\u201d Makan said. \u201cYou are never further than five rows from the musicians. You hear what the musicians hear \u2013 it\u2019s a remarkable, visceral experience, leveling the relationship between performer and audience member.\u201d\n\nThe design can also transform the experience of performers, as \u201cmusicians can align their playing with a soloist in different ways. It\u2019s a liberating experience,\u201d Makan said.\n\nThe Linde can be a catalyst for innovation in performances and a way for the program to partner with local institutions such as the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Makan said.\n\n\u201cSonic Jubilance\u201d concert\n\nThe Saturday concert, \u201cSonic Jubilance,\u201d features four world premieres of pieces composed by MIT music faculty for this event: Makan\u2019s \u201cMadrigal\u201d (named after the statue), John Harbison\u2019s \u201cTwo Noble Kinsmen,\u201d Charles Shadle\u2019s \u201cGrace\u201d and Miguel Zen\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cSummit.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Madrigal\u2019 is a tribute to Joyce Linde, who passed away before the opening of the building,\u201d Makan said. \u201cShe also loved the visual arts and took part in choosing the Sanford Biggers sculpture.\u201d\n\nThe program also presents works by Copland, Ravel, Gonzaga, Bud Powell and Benny Golson.\n\nPerformers include the MIT Concert Choir and Chamber Chorus, vocal and instrumental jazz ensembles, the Chamber Music Society, Wind Ensemble, Gamelan Galak Tika and Rambax, an ensemble employing a drum and dance tradition from Senegal. An open house from 1 to 3:30 p.m. Saturday offers Balinese gamelan and Senegalese drum workshops as well as performances by MIT chamber music and jazz ensembles.\n\nEvents into May\n\nArtfinity\u2019s 25 concerts will present jazz, classical and rap artists, including Grammy-winning saxophonist and MIT professor Miguel Zen\u00f3n; the Boston Symphony Chamber Players; Houston-based Kinetic, a conductorless chamber and orchestral ensemble founded by Natalie Lin Douglas, an MIT assistant professor of chamber music and advanced music performance; and poet and rapper BIC (Roosevelt Saillant), who will perform in Krey\u00f2l (Haitian Creole) with singer Sherlee Skai and Cambridge-based Haitian folkloric dance group Jean Appolon Expressions. Biggers, a musician as well as a sculptor, will stage a concert with his concept band Moonmedicin.\n\nArtfinity concludes with a public lecture May 1 by artist and designer Es Devlin, the 2025 recipient of MIT\u2019s Eugene McDermott Award in the Arts; and a May 2 concert by Grammy-winning rapper and MIT visiting scholar Lupe Fiasco with the MIT Jazz Ensemble.\n\nVisitors can register for concerts and view more than 60 artworks on the MIT campus, guided by tour introduced by Leonard Nimoy or by a map for mobile devices.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Environmental Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) stands against other best environmental stocks to buy.\n\nEnvironmental stocks have gained attention in recent times with more investors being interested in stock stability and increased regulatory focus for climate change issues and the financial markets. They are often favored for their potential to tap into environmental opportunities, as consumers, regulators, and companies seeking to meet Net-Zero targets increasingly look for new and innovative solutions to combat climate change and overcome environmental challenges.\n\nFund managers looking to meet their transition strategies are heavily shifting towards low-carbon solutions and projects. Potential growth projects include renewable energy projects, nuclear energy restarts and renewals, solar, battery storage projects, carbon capture and storage, and new natural gas capacity among others. The US SIF Trends Report 2024/2025 identified that 73% of surveyed investors expect the sustainable investment market to be on the rise in the next 2 years, driven by client demand, regulatory requirements, and advances in data analytics. The fund landscape is fast changing with transition investing becoming the major focus for investors, even with the potential uncertainties due to the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to revoke EV tax credits, driven by new technologies in the sector and decreases in costs. The outlook for renewable energy is still positive. A PwC report finds that ESG-focused institutional investment will rise 84% to $33.9 trillion in 2026, comprising over 21.5% of assets under management. Environmental stocks have experienced fluctuating performance, influenced by market dynamics and investor sentiment in recent years. In 2022, U.S. ESG funds net inflows decreased significantly from $69.2 billion in 2021 to $3.1 billion, the lowest level in seven years. 2023 followed a similar trend, with ESG funds in the U.S. experiencing net outflows exceeding $5 billion in the final quarter, the most substantial quarterly withdrawal in over five years. Poor investment performance and increased political scrutiny were driving forces for the slowdown. Even with the market challenges and fluctuations, certain companies within the environmental sector have demonstrated strong resilience. In summary, while investor opinions of stronger environmental stocks performance over traditional stocks remain debatable, select firms continue to stand resilient in the ever-evolving ESG landscape.\n\nWhat Are Environmental Stocks?\n\nSeveral funds are focused on industry stocks for companies that provide products and services in climate solutions or green investments that work towards reducing harmful pollutants or sustainable resource use. This can either be in the area of alternative technologies, e.g. solar/wind power, or other areas of environmental solutions such as waste management. As industries that rely heavily on fossil fuels and create pollution are facing higher costs, fines, and regulatory scrutiny, the market opportunity for alternatives is on the rise. Several mutual funds and index funds are looking at these alternative investments that provide a strong potential for future returns.\n\nThe Green Economy Index Family tracks the sectors focusing on the enhancement of economic development based on the reduction of carbon usage. These sectors include energy efficiency, bio/clean fuels, and pollution mitigation. Environmental stocks form a key part of sustainable investing, and therefore, by prioritizing environmental concerns, investors can contribute to long-term sustainability and reduce the negative costs of climate change.\n\nHowever, with growing fund manager attention and the potential of gains through policy benefits, the risk of greenwashing and misleading claims by companies is also becoming a significant challenge. This has led financial watchdogs to increase scrutiny and seller responsibility in several geographies that specify accurate \u2018labels\u2019 for levels of environmental and green funds. With the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ESG Disclosure Rule, stricter and more enforceable ESG regulations and disclosure requirements are on the horizon for the US markets.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the best environmental stocks to buy list, we have considered all US environmental stocks that feature on different indexes and have upscale potential. To identify stocks from the environmental sector we have used the FTSE Green Revenues Classification System, to come up with the sectors that are working in the provision of green solutions, these included companies involved in alternative energy generation, water and wastewater treatments, transport solutions, and pollution control. We then used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund Q3 2024 database to rank 10 stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders. Our list is sorted in ascending order according to hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

            "content": "Linde India Limited ( ) shareholders are probably feeling a little disappointed, since its shares fell 2.7% to \u20b96,016 in the week after its latest third-quarter results. Revenues were \u20b96.1b, 23% shy of what the analysts were expecting, although statutory earnings of \u20b950.90 per share were roughly in line with what was forecast. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.\n\nFollowing the latest results, Linde India's two analysts are now forecasting revenues of \u20b937.8b in 2026. This would be a huge 50% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to bounce 42% to \u20b973.55. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of \u20b943.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of \u20b983.32 in 2026. Indeed, we can see that the analysts are a lot more bearish about Linde India's prospects following the latest results, administering a real cut to revenue estimates and slashing their EPS estimates to boot.\n\nThe consensus price target fell 8.9% to \u20b97,206, with the weaker earnings outlook clearly leading valuation estimates.\n\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the itself. It's clear from the latest estimates that Linde India's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 38% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2026 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 13% p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 13% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Linde India is expected to grow much faster than its industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for Linde India. They also downgraded Linde India's revenue estimates, but industry data suggests that it is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. Furthermore, the analysts also cut their price targets, suggesting that the latest news has led to greater pessimism about the intrinsic value of the business.\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Linde India. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

            "content": "BNN Bloomberg is Canada\u2019s definitive source for business news dedicated exclusively to helping Canadians invest and build their businesses.\n\nTeal Linde, manager, Linde Equity Fund\n\nFOCUS: North American mid and large cap stocks\n\nTop Picks: UiPath, Adobe, Pembina\n\nMARKET OUTLOOK:\n\nAI has been a major driver of the U.S. market and the sudden emergence of DeepSeek has put some cracks in the bullish thesis. A number of analysts have been quick to cite Jevons\u2019 Paradox as a reason why the incumbent tech giants driving up the market will not only be fine, but actually benefit further from what\u2019s been going on. Jevons\u2019 paradox is named after the English economist, William Jevons, who noted in the 1860s that as coal powered steam engines became more efficient, the demand for coal didn\u2019t decrease. It increased.\n\nSo, AI bulls are drawing parallels to Jevons\u2019 paradox suggesting the much-reduced AI cost structure introduced by DeepSeek is going to spur even greater demand for AI, therefore rewarding the tech giants and their hundreds of billions of dollars in investments.\n\nHowever, there is a slight problem with this logic. Jevons\u2019 paradox applied to an undifferentiated input such as coal. The inputs for AI are very differentiated which allows for a lot of substitution \u2013 substitution of different types of semiconductors, hardware and software. Nvidia sells increasingly powerful and expensive GPUs. However, DeepSeek was able to use older and cheaper computer chips to basically get the same job done by coding very clever software. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being spent on data centers to support AI demand.\n\nHowever, DeepSeek\u2019s has also demonstrated that by using very clever software, it can enable highly capable distilled versions of large language models to run on consumer hardware such as an iPhone. DeepSeek is also open source which is freely accessible to everyone.\n\nSo yes, cheaper AI processing will spur increased demand. However, it\u2019s not necessarily the incumbent tech giants who will be the biggest winners. Instead, the real stars of tomorrow will likely be smaller organizations or even startups that can now leverage more affordable AI to create products and services we haven\u2019t even imagined yet.\n\nMarket-moving news, fast: Get the BNN Bloomberg App now\n\nSign up for the Market Call Top Picks newsletter at bnnbloomberg.ca/subscribe\n\nTOP PICKS:\n\nUiPATH (PATH NASD)\n\nUiPath is being recommended as more of a thematic play on the emergence of agentic AI, which follows in the footsteps of generative AI. Generative AI acts mostly as a creative assistant that responds to prompts from humans while agentic AI functions as an autonomous problem-solver and decision-maker with minimal human intervention. Agentic AI is good news for UiPath which is the industry leader in providing robotic process automation software, which automates repetitive digital tasks normally performed by people. But the problem with robotic process automation is that it relies heavily on a structured environment. It can\u2019t handle exceptions to the rule well. So that\u2019s where agentic AI can step in and respond to unique or special situations and learn how to adapt and solve the problem just like humans do. So agentic AI bodes well for expanding the use cases of UiPath\u2019s automation offerings. Analysts have mostly a hold on the stock because they are waiting to see more traction. But if you wait for that to happen, you will probably end up having to pay a higher price. UiPath also has net cash of over $1.5 billion representing over 20 per cent of the company\u2019s value.\n\nADOBE (ADBE NASD)\n\nIn December, Adobe reported better than expected fourth quarter revenues and earnings. But management reduced their first quarter and 2025 earnings guidance by less than two per cent each and its stock fell over 20 per cent afterwards. The sell off seems a bit overdone. Investors are worried about Adobe\u2019s ability to monetize its AI features. However, the company is pursuing a strategy which should show more progress this year. Segmentation of the user base is a key initiative to enable more optimal pricing, which would get those who are willing to pay to pay more, and by offering a more affordable \u201con ramp\u201d for more price sensitive low-end customers. Management also noted progress in the rollout of Express, which is their new product to compete against Canva. The company is also betting on the enterprise segment as a key growth driver and largest near-term opportunity through its rollout of GenStudio. GenStudio is its long-promised solution that ties together the end-to-end workflow of idea creation, production, delivery and activation from a marketing standpoint. It\u2019s basically an AI factory for advertisers. Finally, as a vote of confidence, the CEO of Ely Lilly recently made a $1 million stock purchase. But it wasn\u2019t Ely Lily stock that he bought, he bought US$1 million of Adobe at $444 just two weeks ago. He\u2019s a board member of Adobe and this purchase was in excess of his minimum share ownership requirement.\n\nPEMBINA PIPELINE (PPL TSX)\n\nPembina is the third largest energy infrastructure company in Canada after Enbridge and TC Energy. It owns the largest infrastructure network in the natural gas rich Montney region. Its dominance in this active area gives Pembina meaningful exposure to increasing natural gas development in western Canada arising from expanding LNG projects on the BC coast. The company has an attractive current and potential suite of infrastructure projects to support growth into the late 2020s including its floating Cedar LNG 50/50 joint venture in Kitimat, which the BC government has just put on its initial list of resource projects to fast track to completion amid US tariff threats. Between the company\u2019s excess cashflow after paying out dividends and its less leveraged balance sheet than both Enbridge and TC Energy, the company has significant capacity to self-fund major projects over the next few years without having to issue shares. Pembina\u2019s stock has recently pulled back providing a decent entry point while offering a 5.3 per cent dividend yield.\n\nDISCLOSURE PERSONAL FAMILY PORTFOLIO/FUND PATH Y Y Y ADBE Y Y Y PPL Y Y Y\n\nPAST PICKS: February 13, 2024\n\nBLUE OWL CAPITAL (OWL NYSE)\n\nThen: US$17.36\n\nNow: US$23.41\n\nReturn: 35%\n\nTotal Return: 39%\n\nFIVE BELOW (FIVE NASD)\n\nThen: US$184.13\n\nNow: US$90.64\n\nReturn: -51%\n\nTotal Return: -51%\n\nTD BANK (TD TSX)\n\nThen: $78.60\n\nNow: $85.78\n\nReturn: 9%\n\nTotal Return: 14%\n\nTotal Return Average: 0.6%",

Rashid Khan's men, who had struggled in the previous two seasons, produced a commanding all-round performance to secure a 76-run victory, thanks to a stellar bowling display led by Kagiso Rabada.\n\nOpting to bat first at Highveld, MI Cape Town\u2019s top-order came out with an aggressive mindset, making full use of the batting-friendly conditions. Dewald Brevis and George Linde played crucial cameos, keeping the scoreboard ticking despite wickets falling at regular intervals. Even as the innings lost momentum in the middle overs, MICT\u2019s attacking intent never wavered, and they managed to post a competitive total of 181 for 8.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRabada dismantles Sunrisers\n\nWhile the batting laid the foundation, it was the bowlers who truly sealed the deal for MI Cape Town. Kagiso Rabada delivered a match-winning spell, claiming 4 wickets for just 25 runs, ensuring Sunrisers Eastern Cape never got into the chase. Trent Boult (2/9) and George Linde (2/20) provided the perfect support, as the defending champions crumbled under pressure and were bundled out for just 105.\n\nMarking an incredible turnaround after finishing bottom of the table in the previous two seasons, Rashid Khan\u2019s MI Cape Town finally found their rhythm, combining fearless batting with clinical bowling. Dewald Brevis, who was named the Rising Star of the Season, played a pivotal role in the team\u2019s success, showcasing his explosive potential throughout the tournament.\n\nWith this commanding win, MI Cape Town have firmly established themselves as a force to be reckoned with in SA20 cricket, much in an attempt to match the stature of their sister team, Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Sunrisers Eastern Cape\u2019s dominant run was halted in emphatic fashion, and MI\u2019s first-ever title could mark the beginning of a new era for the franchise.",

Picture: Ron Gaunt\n\nZaahier Adams\n\nMICT: 181/8 (Esterhuizen 39, Brevis 38, Gleeson 2/22, Jansen 2/39)\n\nSunrisers Eastern Cape: 105 all out (Abell 30, De Zorzi 26, Rabada 4/25, Linde 2/29)\n\nRESULT: MI Cape Town won by 76 runs\n\nLike a runaway train there was no stopping MI Cape Town as they dethroned the Sunrisers Eastern Cape to win their maiden Betway SA20 title at rousing Wanderers on Saturday evening.\n\nRobin Peterson\u2019s team had been the dominant team throughout the competition, topping the log with a record 35 points, and now they have inflicted a first-ever play-off defeat on the Sunrisers.\n\nMI Cape Town had played a fearless brand of cricket up to the final, and they continued with that aggressive brand of cricket to set Sunrisers a target of 182.\n\nThroughout the competition the focus has been on MI Cape Town\u2019s fearsome batting unit. But their bowling unit led by the irrepressible Kagiso Rabada (4/25) who claimed a magnificent four-wicket to spearhead his team\u2019s victory charge\n\nRabada was ably supported by spin twins George Linde (2/20) and Rashid Khan (1/19).\n\nIt was Rabada that struck the initial blow by removing David Bedingham early on before Linde (2/20) and Rashid (1/19) spun a web around the Sunrisers\u2019 potentially dangerous middle-order. Rabada then returned to clean up the Sunrisers tail as the defending champions folded under the scoreboard pressure of chasing in a final.\n\nNot even a 57-run partnership between Tom Abell and Tony de Zorzi for the third wicket could ignite the Sunrisers\u2019 innings, especially after they were dismissed within three runs of each other.\n\nAnd when Markram was brilliantly caught by Rabada at point off Linde, it was merely an elongated wait for the new champions to be crowned as they slipped to 105 all out.\n\nAfter winning the toss and electing to bat MI Cape Town had earlier raced out of the starting blocks with Ryan Rickelton and Rassie van der Dussen taking the attack to the famed Sunrisers bowling attack.\n\nIn an almost premeditated plan it was Rickelton that targeted the competition\u2019s premier bowler Marco Jansen. After a quiet opening over from Craig Overton, Rickelton swung hard against Jansen.\n\nA straight boundary over Jansen\u2019s head kickstarted the innings before two wild swings flew over deep third man and fine leg for a couple of sixes. MI Cape Town were away and Rickelton was leading the charge.\n\nTwo more sixes of Rickelton\u2019s flaying willow in Jansen\u2019s follow-up over saw MI Cape Town reach fifty without loss in just the fifth over.\n\nBut at that point things took a turn with Rickelton (33 off 15 balls; 1x4, 4x6) and new batter Reeza Hendricks (0 off 2 balls) falling within one run of the other to see MI Cape Town close out the Powerplay at 52/2.\n\nThe innings\u2019 momentum swung wildly from thereon. Linde (20 off 14 balls, 3x6) and Dewald Brevis (38 off 18, 2x4, 4x6) provided the impetus while Connor Esterhuizen (39 off 26 balls, 2x4, 2x6) kept it all together.\n\nAfter two seasons after finishing stone last on the table, MI Cape Town\u2019s victory has been one of the most astounding comebacks in South African cricket history as they completed a fairytale win under the Highveld stars.",

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nView our latest analysis for Linde\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Linde\n\nThe insider, John Panikar, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.6m worth of shares at a price of US$463 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$455. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.\n\nIn total, Linde insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\nNasdaqGS:LIN Insider Trading Volume February 8th 2025\n\nI will like Linde better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nInsiders At Linde Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen notably more insider selling, than insider buying, at Linde. In total, insiders sold US$3.0m worth of shares in that time. On the flip side, Independent Director Paula G. Reynolds spent US$44k on purchasing shares (as mentioned above) . Since the selling really does outweigh the buying, we'd say that these transactions may suggest that some insiders feel the shares are not cheap.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Linde insiders own about US$372m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.",

            "content": "MI Cape Town Wins First SA20 Title, Defeats Sunrisers With outstanding performances, MI Cape Town secures the championship, ending Sunrisers' dream of three consecutive titles.\n\nMI Cape Town triumphed over Sunrisers Eastern Cape by 76 runs to clinch their first SA20 title at the Wanderers Stadium on Saturday night, ending the latter's hopes of securing three consecutive championships.\n\nThe match, which drew substantial crowds, was filled with excitement as fans anticipated the showdown between two of the competition's top teams. MI Cape Town showcased their prowess throughout the season, aiming for redemption after finishing last for two consecutive seasons before this one.\n\nMI Cape Town won the toss and opted to bat first, setting the stage for what would be a high-scoring encounter. The opening pair of Rassie van der Dussen and Ryan Rickelton got off to a blistering start, with Rickelton smashing four sixes on his way to 33 runs off just 15 balls. MI Cape Town capitalized on their early momentum, with Dewald Brevis making headlines by scoring 38 off 18 balls, including four sixes.\n\nWhile wickets fell at regular intervals, most batsmen contributed to the eventual score of 181, with Connor Esterhuizen adding valuable runs through his solid 39 off 26 deliveries. The bowling attack was bolstered by excellent contributions from George Linde and Kagiso Rabada, the latter finishing with impressive figures of 4/25.\n\nThe chase for Sunrisers Eastern Cape began poorly, as they struggled against MI Cape Town\u2019s bowling. They found themselves at 74 for 5 after just 11.2 overs. Tom Abell and Tony de Zorzi scored 30 and 26 runs respectively, but no substantial partnerships developed as MI Cape Town's bowlers continued to dominate the game. Kagiso Rabada led the charge, complimented by Trent Boult and George Linde, ending Sunrisers' innings at just 105 runs.\n\nThis victory symbolized not only MI Cape Town's remarkable comeback season but also demonstrated their evolution as a team capable of overcoming past disappointments. Captain Rashid Khan expressed his pride, stating, \"We have been playing some amazing cricket over the last month, and I think if you believe in and just focus on what we can do best on the day, that's what matters.\" This positive mindset propelled the team through the final.\n\nSunrisers Eastern Cape, who entered the match as defending champions, had hoped to become the first team to win the SA20 final three times consecutively. Despite their earlier head-to-head triumphs against MI Cape Town, including defeats by large margins during the group stages, the final's outcome was starkly different as they succumbed to MI Cape Town's relentless attack.\n\nThe atmosphere at the Wanderers was electric, with fans from both camps creating lively support. The packed stadium reverberated with cheers for MI Cape Town, particularly evident during the team's innings as every boundary and wicket earned raucous applause. The experienced MI Cape Town squad contrasted sharply with the struggling Sunrisers, whose attempts to build momentum often fell short against exceptional bowling.\n\nReflecting on the match, Tony de Zorzi, who had replaced the injured Patrick Kruger earlier this season, noted the switch from being favorites to facing a team on the rise. His performance throughout the tournament spoke volumes about his calibre, but on this day, his efforts could not avert disaster.\n\nWith the season concluded, MI Cape Town has established itself as the team to beat, and the road to future championships will begin with the foundations laid during this hard-fought victory. Supporters are looking forward to seeing how the team builds on this triumph, hoping to maintain the momentum they\u2019ve gained.\n\nThis final was not just about the trophy; it was about setting the stage for the future of SA20 cricket. With MI Cape Town embarking on their championship run, it will be interesting to see how all clubs adapt and recalibrate for the next chapter of this dynamic competition.\n\nMI Cape Town's performance at the Wanderers not only secured the prestigious title but also highlighted the league's potential for spectacular matches and unforgettable moments. Fans and players alike will have this conclusion etched in their memories for years to come, marking it as both the contentious end of one season and the bright beginning of another.",

            "content": "Lenox \u2014 More than a dozen years after the Tanglewood Jazz Festival ended, the Boston Symphony Orchestra remains a major champion of jazz music in the Berkshires. In recent years, Wynton and Ellis Marsalis, Diana Krall, Tony Bennett, Harry Connick Jr., Joey Alexander, Chris Botti, Bela Fleck, and other prominent jazz musicians have given unforgettable performances in Tanglewood\u2019s Shed and Ozawa Hall.\n\nBut since year-round programming came to Tanglewood\u2019s Linde Center for Music and Learning in the fall of 2024, the BSO has offered all manner of musical artistry, including both classical repertoire and jazz. For example, jazz pianist and composer Ted Rosenthal performed to a sold-out crowd at the Linde Center with his trio in September, and GRAMMY winner Nicole Zuraitis brought her band to the center in November. On the classical side, the Arcis Saxophone Quartet stunned a Linde Center audience on November 9 with fun and adventuresome repertoire performed with uncanny precision.\n\nOn February 14 and 15, trumpeter and vocalist Jumaane Smith comes to the Linde Center to present his program \u201cLove Always: Celebrating the Romance of Nat King Cole,\u201d and both nights are already sold out.\n\nBoston University Professor of Music Jeremy Yudkin, author of \u201cThe Lenox School of Jazz,\u201d had this to say about jazz music at Tanglewood and Jumaane Smith in particular:\n\nIt is such good news that the Jumaane Smith concert is sold out for two nights at the Tanglewood Linde Center. Programming there has been spectacular this year since the BSO has committed to year-round programming here in the Berkshires. I am especially delighted by the first-rate jazz musicians that are coming to the Linde Center. From the magisterial Ted Rosenthal to the brilliant young Arcis Saxophone Quartet to the multi-talented Smith, jazz has returned to Tanglewood in full swing since the demise of the Tanglewood Jazz Festival in 2012. Keep it up, BSO!\n\nEd Bride, founder and president of Berkshires Jazz Inc., added this:\n\nIt has become a truism that \u2018jazz is America\u2019s classical music.\u2019 It is magnificent that Tanglewood, the shrine for classical music, is wholeheartedly embracing jazz. Music followers will take note (sorry).\n\nI spoke via Zoom with Jumaane Smith a few weeks ago to find out more about what we have to look forward to on February 14 and 15. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nEDGE\n\nOn February 14 and 15 at Tanglewood\u2019s Linde Center, you are performing a program of songs made famous by Nat King Cole.\n\nSMITH\n\nYeah. It\u2019s a program that I have put together as a love/romantic program, not specifically only for this Valentine\u2019s Day, but I am very excited for this particular performance at Tanglewood. It\u2019s going to be a blast.\n\nEDGE\n\nIs the program all Nat King Cole material?\n\nSMITH\n\nNo, but there\u2019s going to be a lot of nice romantic songs that Nat King Cole used to do. It\u2019ll be a lot of the great American songbook songs. I have some original material as well that we\u2019re going to perform. I am also planning to do some of my original arrangements of some of the American Songbook Classic songs in our own way. And it\u2019s just going to be a really nice, fun, exciting, romantic evening for Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nEDGE\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve heard of your music thus far, it sounds like you\u2019re a genuine blues man. Is that fair to say?\n\nSMITH\n\nI am a good music man, but my roots are in jazz and blues for sure. Definitely. But I wouldn\u2019t say exclusively one part of jazz or part of blues. Nat King Cole has always been a big influence on my singing, and so that\u2019s why I\u2019m excited to put this particular project together.\n\nEDGE\n\nWhat do you bring to the music of Nat King Cole that nobody else brings?\n\nSMITH\n\nWell, I bring my personality. I bring my abilities musically. I\u2019m also a trumpeter, not just a vocalist, and so it\u2019s going to have a different element to it just by the instruments that we\u2019re going to utilize, even alone. There\u2019s also just the energy of my band. We\u2019ve been working together for several years and have a nice, tight, cohesive sound, and you\u2019ll see the interplay between the musicians, and it is going to be an exciting evening. Plus, Nat King Cole\u2014he\u2019s not around anymore for us to have these live performances of material inspired by his art, and a lot of great artists\u2014legendary artists\u2014aren\u2019t with us anymore. So one of the things that I aspire to do is to perform material that is from the past, not exclusively, but some material that is from the past, but informed by that history and expressing the continuation of that history.\n\nEDGE\n\nYou recently said that you were taking center stage as band leader and composer.\n\nSMITH\n\nI\u2019ve been a bandleader for many years. But on my last album, \u201cCome On Home,\u201d I set out to primarily do original material, and so that was a really exciting thing. I plan to share some of that material at the Linde Center, because some of it fits into the theme of love and romance. I guess a lot of people know me best as a sideman with Michael Bubl\u00e9 and Stevie Wonder and Quincy Jones and artists like that\u2014Harry Connick, Wynton Marsalis\u2014and so the idea of me taking center stage is more about me showing that I am a bandleader in my own right. It\u2019s something I do a lot more of now, and it has become my primary focus.\n\nEDGE\n\nYou\u2019ve worked with a long list of iconic musicians. Is there anyone you haven\u2019t worked with yet that you wish you could?\n\nSMITH\n\nI would like to collaborate with Raye. She\u2019s a young, new artist who is heavily influenced by jazz but also has a lot of R&B in her sound as well. I find her music really interesting. Another interesting collaboration would be with Jacob Collier. I got to perform with Herbie Hancock one time, or a couple times, but I would like to do a full concert with him. That would be cool.\n\nEDGE\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Louis Armstrong.\n\nSMITH\n\nHe\u2019s one of my biggest influences.\n\nEDGE\n\nIt\u2019s been said that if Armstrong were still around today, he\u2019d be making music like yours. What do you think about that?\n\nSMITH\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible honor, and I hope that what I do is continuing the legacy and tradition of Armstrong and lots of these great artists. I\u2019m influenced by the history of the music, and I try to take those influences with me and put them into my performances as well as my own life experience\u2014the ups and downs, the good and bad, and everything in between.\n\nEDGE\n\nYou studied with Wynton Marsalis, whose influence on you as a musician must have been substantially different from that of Armstrong. How does your playing today reflect it?\n\nSMITH\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that you would say his influence is substantially different from Louis Armstrong\u2019s because, honestly, Wynton is probably the person who really turned me on to Louis Armstrong\u2019s music.\n\nEDGE\n\nYou weren\u2019t really a fan before then?\n\nSMITH\n\nWell, I was a young kid. And so he opened up my ears and eyes to more of the history and more of where these artists that I was digging on at the time had been coming from and where they got their stuff from.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you have tickets to see Jumaane Smith at the Linde Center on February 14 or 15, please note that show times are 7 p.m. on both nights, with doors opening 6 p.m. Seating is cabaret style, and you can pre-order food, with beverages available to order at your table.

            "content": "Linde Plc ((LIN)) has held its Q4 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.\n\nLinde\u2019s latest earnings call conveyed a positive sentiment, underscoring the company\u2019s robust financial performance and its strides in sustainability, even as it navigates the complexities of foreign exchange challenges and economic uncertainties in regions like EMEA and China. The optimism about continuing to deliver shareholder value was palpable throughout the discussion.\n\nSustainability Achievements\n\nLinde has made significant headway in its sustainability initiatives, having boosted its low carbon and renewable energy consumption by 19% year-over-year. Impressively, over 40% of its total power consumption is now derived from low carbon sources. Further solidifying its commitment, Linde has been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for an impressive 22nd consecutive year.\n\nFinancial Performance\n\nLinde\u2019s financial performance is leading the industry with a return on capital (ROC) of 25.9%. The company\u2019s EBIT margins have risen by 190 basis points to 29.5%, and earnings per share (EPS) have climbed by 10%, despite foreign exchange headwinds. In a testament to its financial strength, Linde returned $7 billion to shareholders.\n\nRecord Backlog and Growth\n\nThe company closed the year with a record backlog exceeding $10 billion, which includes a noteworthy $7 billion in gas backlog sales. Among these, a significant $2 billion project win in Canada stands out, marking a milestone in Linde\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nSmall Onsite Contracts\n\nLinde has set a new record for small onsite wins, having signed 59 long-term agreements that will result in the development of 64 plants. This success highlights Linde\u2019s strategic focus on expanding its onsite gas production footprint.\n\nForeign Exchange Headwinds\n\nLinde faced a 4% foreign exchange translation headwind, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This challenge has been a significant factor affecting the company\u2019s financial results.\n\nEMEA Volume Decline\n\nIn the EMEA region, Linde experienced flat volume growth. The positive contributions from the project backlog in the Americas and APAC were offset by lower base volumes in EMEA, largely attributed to softer demand in metals and mining industries.\n\nEconomic Challenges in China\n\nLinde expressed concerns about the economic outlook in China, where a significant recovery is not anticipated until 2025. The company expects industrial volumes to remain stable but flat, with metals and mining likely to experience a year-on-year decline.\n\nGuidance for 2025\n\nLooking forward, Linde\u2019s 2025 guidance includes expectations for EPS growth of over 10%, driven by strategic capital allocations and management actions, despite a continuing 4% FX headwind. The company forecasts a 4% to 7% EPS growth, or 8% to 11% when excluding currency impacts, assuming a flat industrial production environment. Linde also aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2035, demonstrating its long-term commitment to sustainability.\n\nIn conclusion, Linde\u2019s earnings call painted a picture of a company that is both resilient and forward-thinking. Despite facing economic and currency challenges, it continues to deliver strong financial performance and record growth, all while maintaining a firm commitment to sustainability. Investors and stakeholders can take confidence in Linde\u2019s strategic priorities and optimistic outlook for the future.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

He emphasized the importance of the 45Q IRS provision, which predates the IRA and is a key incentive for over 90% of their U.S. projects. Linde remains confident in their project pipeline and expects to continue announcing new projects, particularly in clean energy.\n\nQ: Will Americas' margins gain ground in 2025, and how does this compare to other regions?\n\nA: Sanjiv Lamba, CEO, stated that there is no impediment to improving margins across all regions, including the Americas and APAC. He expects margin expansion in 2025, typically ranging from 20 to 50 basis points. Linde encourages each segment to learn from high-margin businesses within the company to bridge any gaps.\n\nQ: What is the impact of industrial production (IP) on Linde's earnings, and what are the global IP trends?\n\nA: Sanjiv Lamba, CEO, noted that base volumes are closely tied to IP, with higher leverage in developing countries. Globally, IP is close to zero, with variations across regions. The Americas show solid performance, while Europe is experiencing softening. In China, no significant recovery is expected in 2025, but electronics are a growth area.\n\nQ: How does Linde view market share in the industrial gas market, and are there any shifts?\n\nA: Sanjiv Lamba, CEO, emphasized that Linde focuses more on network density rather than market share. The company has a record sale of gas backlog, indicating strong market positioning. Linde's strategy is to maintain strong customer relationships and margin expansion through network density.\n\nQ: What is the contribution of pricing versus productivity and cost management in Linde's guidance?\n\nA: Matthew White, CFO, explained that the guidance assumes a roughly 50-50 split between management actions and capital allocation for the 10% EPS growth target. The focus is on maintaining a positive spread between price and cost inflation, which is crucial for long-term margin expansion.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.",

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJuan Pelaez: Abby, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending our 2024 fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. I\u2019m Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde\u2019s fourth quarter financial performance and 2025 outlook, after which, we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.\n\nSanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Looking back, 2024 was another successful year for the Linde organization. I\u2019d like to personally thank the 65,000-plus employees for their relentless drive to deliver shareholder value while they live our core values every day. This isn\u2019t something that happens overnight. Or can it be copied or indeed driven top-down from a handful of individuals. Rather, it is a result stemming from decades long culture, mindset and operating growth. And it can best be exemplified by the results shown on Slide 3. From my perspective, there are four key categories that Linde must excel at, day in day out, to maintain our long-term industry-leading position. Of course, we must deliver on our key financial metrics and remain responsible stewards of our owners\u2019 capital.\n\nThat\u2019s a given. But we have a sustainable leadership position for that and the long term, that requires continued investment in our people and surrounding communities, as well as doing our path to help improve the environment. Finally, we must position ourselves for the future to ensure resilient and continuous growth and improvement. We can never be complacent based on past performance. I want to start with our people and communities, because Linde\u2019s success has always been, and always will be, attributed to our employees\u2019 ownership mentality and collective efforts. We continuously strive to be good corporate citizens in thousands of communities where we live and work. Also having a safe and diverse [indiscernible] is a top priority in order to ensure Linde\u2019s competitiveness for many years to come.\n\nAnd you can see the improvements we\u2019ve made from an already leading position. More work is to be done, and I fully expect to leverage technology in that effort, but I am pleased to see the progress made to date. While people and communities are a priority, efforts towards ensuring a sustainable environment are becoming more challenging every day. I think it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re seeing more extreme weather now than in prior years. And here at Linde, we will continue to do our part to help the environment, through an increased focus on low carbon power, Linde increased its active low carbon and renewable energy consumption by 19% year-over-year. In 2024, over 40% of our total power consumption is now low carbon based. These are just a few of the many accomplishments, and I want to encourage you to read our annual report for many more.\n\nFurthermore, it is rewarding to see our sustainability efforts being recognized by some of the most prestigious names such as the Dow Jones, which included Linde in its sustainability world index for the 22nd consecutive year. In addition, we\u2019ve pride ourselves in helping our customers, avoiding more than 2x our CO2 emissions through the use of our products and services. But there is much more work ahead to achieve our ambitious sustainability goals, including reducing our greenhouse gas emissions 35% by 2035. Turning to financial performance. Linde once again led the industry across key metrics. 25.9% ROC. EBIT margins increased 190 basis points to 29.5%. EPS increasing 10% as FX and $7 billion of capital returned to shareholders from the significant excess free cash flow.\n\nThese are the best metrics in the industry, some by a wide margin. This provides us with a source of pride and ownership, but we also recognize this is the past. Valuations are derived from a combination of past performance and future expectations. So we must continuously position ourselves for future growth, regardless of the macroeconomic conditions. Positioning for future staff with a concise strategy and a capital allocation policy. At Linde, we know that the investments we make, and the ones we avoid are equally important, because mistakes in this industry can have long-lasting consequences. This is why sticking to our core business while maintaining disciplined contract terms is critical to building safe, reliable and profitable supply infrastructure.\n\nThe year ended with more than $10 billion in backlog, including a record sale of gas backlog of $7 billion. Included in this is a $2-plus billion to [indiscernible] win in Canada which is a great example of a high-quality project in a core geography. This project normally has fixed payment structure with predicted returns that materially improves our local supply density in a fast-growing vision for clean energy. I fully expect to be announcing new projects and customers in the near future. But growing in industrial gases in more than just mega projects. We have to continue keeping our eye on smaller opportunities as well ensuring that they add attractive annuity-like growth. During 2024, we once again set a record for small on-site wins, signing 59 long-term agreements for a total of 64 plants, all of which will increase reliability and strengthen our network density.\n\nAcquisitions of small tuck-in packaged gas opportunities also remain an important part of synergized growth with 18 signed transactions, with annualized revenues of approximately $200 million. All in, 2024 was another successful year despite the many challenges. That being said, it\u2019s time to move forward and look ahead. All of you have seen the new earnings guidance for 2025, and therefore, I believe it\u2019s important to reiterate the components of our long-standing EPS growth algorithm on Slide 4. For many years now, we\u2019ve defined our EPS growth into 3 categories, of which both capital allocation and management actions are within our control. And the economy is not. Capital allocation represents contributions from a long-standing and stable capital management policy.\n\nThe main elements include our contractual project backlog, share repurchases, small bolt-on acquisitions and capital structure efficiencies, generally achieved through interest and tax management. It\u2019s important to note that our backlog definition is unique in industry as it only includes incremental growth from contractually committed customers with fixed payment elements and termination provisions to ensure a minimum return on capital. While no other company follows the strict interpretation, it certainly provides [indiscernible] greater certainty of backlog EPS contribution in any environment. Similarly, the majority of acquisitions are justified on cost synergies only and therefore, provide a high degree of confidence on capital return and thus EPS generation.\n\nFinally, share repurchases offer an attractive and flexible use of excess free cash flow, as project start-up and acquisition cadence were ebb and flow, enabling a highly consistent EPS contribution from overall capital allocation. All of these elements have historically contributed 4% to 6% EPS growth, and I feel confident this will continue for the years to come. Management actions represent the daily self-help initiatives our employees undertake to ensure growth regardless of the macro climate. Digital solutions and AI are increasingly supporting productivity, price and cost management, which are controllable initiatives deeply embedded into a culture and operating rhythm. And which allow us to grow earnings regardless of the economy. History has proven for these to be the largest compound value generators as they are not directly correlated to overall economic activity.\n\nThis combination of capital allocation and management actions is expected to deliver 10-plus percent EPS growth each year with margin expansion, and 2025 is no exception. The pre or post merger, these two components have been the dominant drivers of our long-term double-digit EPS growth CAGR. While I remain confident in our ability to deliver on this 10%, we are constantly striving to find more opportunities to improve. Conversely, we cannot control the third category, which represents macroeconomic factors. For Linde, these are 2 factors that matter the most. Foreign exchange rates and industrial production as a proxy for base volume trends. Recall that we are a U.S. dollar-functional company with approximately 2/3 of earnings denominated in foreign currencies and thus exposed to FX translation.\n\nSimilarly, while our customers are often under long-term contracts with fixed facility fees, the incremental gas to consume is a function of their own production rates, which typically highly correlates to industrial demand. Hence, why Global IP is a generic proxy for our customer gas consumption of base volumes. The current 2025 guidance range assumes a 4% FX translation headwind, while the midpoint of the range assumes 0% IP growth environment. Overall, it\u2019s clear that the growth algorithm is well intact, but we have our work cut out regarding unfavorable FX translation. This does not come as a surprise, as you may recall from our statements last quarter, and subsequent self-help actions that we initiated. Furthermore, we will continue to identify and execute additional management actions to mitigate macro weakness.\n\nEventually, these economic headwinds will convert to tailwinds, as they always do. And until then, you can be rest assured that the [indiscernible] the organization will be focused on creating shareholder value and maintaining our long-term industry leadership, no matter the environment. I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt to walk through our financial results.\n\nMatthew White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Fourth quarter results can be found on Slide 5. Sales of $8.3 billion are flat to prior year and down 1% sequentially. For both the prior year and sequential comparisons, foreign currency translation was a 2% headwind. Excluding FX and cost pass-through, underlying sales grew 2% versus last year and were flat from the third quarter. Price increases of 2% over 2023 and 1% sequentially continue to track with globally weighted inflation. The volume growth was flat as contribution from the project backlog in the Americas and APAC offset lower base volumes in EMEA. The sequential volume decline is primarily attributed to softer EMEA metals and mining volumes and seasonality factors in APAC. In general, economic trends mostly followed our prior guidance, although the FX impact was worse than expected from a significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar toward the back half of the fourth quarter.\n\nOperating profit of $2.5 billion grew 9% and resulted in a 29.9% margin, primarily from management actions around price, cost and productivity. EPS, $3.97 grew 11%, or 13% excluding FX. The 9% CapEx increase is entirely driven by contractual projects, as base CapEx decreased from a combination of currency, productivity and lower base volumes. I anticipate this trend to continue as we execute on the record $7 billion sale of gas backlog to support future growth. Further details on capital management can be found on Slide 6. Full year operating cash flow ended at $9.4 billion, with almost 60% occurring in the second half. As mentioned in prior calls, I expect this split to remain due to seasonality of specific cash outflows, including incentive payments, taxes and interest.\n\nThe pie chart on the right shows the full year capital allocation. We invested $5 billion back into the business, with half underpinned by secured high-quality growth opportunities. And we returned $7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. Returning this amount of capital to our owners year after year requires a disciplined capital allocation policy and a very healthy balance sheet. Two things that are much easier said than done. I\u2019ll wrap up with guidance on Slide 7. We\u2019re initiating full year EPS guidance of $16.15 to $16.55, representing 4% to 7% growth or 8% to 11% when excluding an estimated 4% currency headwind. As mentioned earlier, the 4% impact is from the accounting translation of foreign earnings, which experienced a rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar towards the end of 2024.\n\nRecall this is merely a projection as we\u2019re required to book the actual months average rate to the income statement. The methodology used for this estimate is consistent with prior practice by using the forward curves on a weighted basis for each foreign currency at the start of the month. Historically, large currency devaluations have often been followed by periods of more significant local inflation, with 2022 being a recent example. If that occurs, I\u2019d anticipate incremental pricing opportunities to recover the currency devaluation impact. These potential pricing opportunities are not baked into the guidance range at this time since the amount or timing of subsequent inflation is difficult to estimate. The midpoint of this range assumes no economic improvement from the current environment and thus assumes flat base volumes.\n\nAs Sanjiv mentioned, our base volumes derived from customer supply contracts. Their growth is a function of gas consumption from our contracted tanks and cylinders. Hence, why local industrial production tends to be the best proxy. First quarter EPS guidance range is $3.85 to $3.95, with similar assumptions to the full year. At this time, we believe it\u2019s appropriate to remain prudent with a more cautious economic outlook. If things turn out better, so too will our results. And if they worsen, we\u2019ll take additional mitigating actions. But regardless of the economy, I\u2019m confident Linde will continue to create shareholder value through our time-tested execution culture, disciplined capital allocation and proven management actions. This has been embedded in our DNA for decades.\n\nAnd over the years, while many have claimed, they\u2019ll simply copy this model, all have failed, because here at Linde, we\u2019re often imitated but never duplicated. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Q&A.\n\nQ&A Session\n\nFollow Lin Media Llc (NYSE:LIN) Follow Lin Media Llc (NYSE:LIN) or Subscribe with Google We may use your email to send marketing emails about our services. Click here to read our privacy policy.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays.\n\nMike Leithead: Sanjiv, there\u2019s a lot of political noise out there right now between tariff potential, new administration, some pullback on green energy funding. I guess how has your discussions with potential project partners evolved at all? I\u2019m really trying to get at, say, projects that are pre-FID today. Have those discussions slowed down or picked up at all?\n\nSanjiv Lamba: So Mike, as we\u2019ve referenced in previous calls, we have seen people take a little bit more time and apply a bit more rigor before going to FID. I think it\u2019s a good thing because you do need that when you\u2019re doing multibillion-dollar projects typically. And I think we\u2019re seeing that pace continue. In there, built in there, obviously, is some uncertainty around the regulatory framework and requirements in terms of what the new administration may or may not do. The one thing I do want to emphasize, though, and I think in the context of clean hydrogen, this is particularly important, people tend to think about the IRA and there\u2019s a lot of talk around what happens with the IRA under the new administration. Within the IRA, there is a specific provision, an IRS provision, in fact, called 45Q, which predates the IRA.\n\nIt actually goes back to around 2008 when it was implemented. And about 90% of the projects that we are developing in the U.S. are actually looking at 45Q as a potential incentive. And I think we feel fairly confident that, that structure around the 45Q will remain as given particularly that it predates the IRA. So I just want to provide that specific clarification because I get a lot of questions around that. But generally, we\u2019re seeing people take a bit more time to get to FID, and we are seeing that they are actually being a little bit more rigorous in their approach before they make a final call in terms of putting capital on the ground. The other point I\u2019d just quickly add to that, Mike, as you\u2019re aware that in the past, we\u2019ve talked about \u2014 I think it was actually 2 years ago, we talked about $8 billion to $10 billion in clean energy investments from a Linde perspective.\n\nWe\u2019re about halfway there given the two projects, the large projects we\u2019ve already announced North America. We\u2019re obviously continuing to develop projects elsewhere. Those two current projects we are working on are both likely to see another phase, which likely means that we will see equivalent investment there, plus the other projects as well. So when I look at the overall pipeline, I feel pretty good about the quality of projects that we\u2019re pursuing and the path to getting to that $8 billion to $10 billion of investments over the next few years looks pretty much intact.\n\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Steven Haynes with Morgan Stanley.\n\nSteven Haynes: So it kind of looks like exiting the year, your EMEA margins are now like 200 basis points ahead of Americas, maybe 100 ex the cost pass-through. So do you think your Americas margins will gain ground in \u201925? And then also as a second piece of this, I think the gap is kind of widening versus APAC. So I was wondering if you could also kind of frame the opportunity there?\n\nSanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Steven. So if you go back historically, about 5 years ago, many of you asked the same question when Americas margins were leading. And I think APAC and EMEA were at 17% and 19%. And we have said then, and I want to repeat again today, that the \u2014 our business is homogeneous, and there is no impediment to getting to the highest margins we see anywhere in our business. The one thing I often point out when we have this conversation around margins is each one of our segments has a country or a business, that has a margin with a [indiscernible] number in front of it. And in many ways, we encourage our businesses, each of the segments to push and try and understand what those successful businesses with a 40-plus percent margins are doing to ensure that we can bridge the gap.\n\nSo to answer your question, both for Americas and APAC, my expectation remains that margins will continue to improve. And again, we\u2019ve said in our prepared remarks earlier on, you should expect to see margin expansion in 2025 for Linde plc overall, which obviously is an aggregation of the different segments. I\u2019d say to you that I\u2019d probably say that, that margin expansion range is between 20 to 50 basis points. Typically, that\u2019s what we expect longer term. Obviously, we\u2019ve been delivering well in excess of that, and that obviously sets up some expectations. But expect margin expansion. Each of those segments will continue to grow margin. No impediment to APAC, bridging that gap. And of course, America has got a solid business, which will continue to expand its margin as well.\n\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fisher with Goldman Sachs.\n\nPatrick Fischer: You talked about IP being your biggest KPI, which is fair. Roughly, what is the leverage if IP is up or down 1%? How much EPS does that generally drive for you? And then if you would maybe just take a spin around the world, what are you seeing IP? I know guiding to flat is prudent. But where do you see potential for things to be better or worse than that?\n\nSanjiv Lamba: I\u2019ll let Matt talk a little bit about the IP correlation and then I\u2019ll give you a walk around the world.\n\nMatthew White: Yes, Duffy. So to start, as you probably know, so we split our volumes into project and base, and our project volumes solely track our startup. So that is, as you know, completely independent of any IP or macroeconomic factor, and it\u2019s purely contractual based on the fixed element. So that one is part of the capital allocation contribution on the EPS group. But to your point, when you think about base volumes, as Sandi mentioned, we have the rental, which is fixed, irregardless. That gets back to the resiliency of our model. As you recall, about 65% of our revenues are fairly resilient. But of the molecules that they take, whether in the cylinder, or whether in the tank for liquid, and to some extent, over fixed fees in the pipe, that\u2019s just going to be a function of their production.\n\nSo from that end, that tends the best proxy to IP. And so I would say within the base volume piece, it aligns. Now to your point, we tend to get higher IP leverage in developing countries where they are expanding more, what you look at is intensity of gas per capita. Whereas in more developed nations, it\u2019s closer to a 1:1 ratio you tend to see on the IP and the base volume tracked. So that\u2019s how I would think about that. When you look around the world, I think we can all agree that how some countries report IP is not equal in all countries. But when we adjust for what we feel are a little bit of some noise in the numbers, what we\u2019ve been seeing is IP close to zero, maybe tens of bps globally weighted on our businesses is what it\u2019s been ranging at.\n\nBut we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out going forward. I think EMEA, a drag, as you know, Americas has been pretty solid. And I think China, depending upon which number you actually want to use, it can range anywhere from close to zero to the official number of 5%, and that\u2019s how we would kind of see the IP. But I\u2019ll hand off to Sanjiv, maybe you can give you a little walk around the world just with general color on trends.\n\nSanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Matt. So that\u2019s helpful and just grounding you on how IP plays into our equation, but also how we think about it. Duffy, let me just walk you through the world. I think it\u2019s a question I\u2019m sure it\u2019s on many people\u2019s minds. I\u2019m going to try and break this down and parse it by two different perspectives. I\u2019ll start off with the markets that we have the end markets and use that as a characteristic to kind of define what we\u2019re expecting and then talk about different geographies as well. So starting over with resilient end markets. By the very nature, you would expect them to grow. And therefore, we expect low to mid-single-digit growth in our resilient end markets driven primarily by electronics and food and beverage.\n\nIndustrial sector, obviously, more cyclical, impacted by industrial activity and demand. We do expect lower volumes there. And versus last year, we expect flat to lower volumes, particularly in metals and chemicals. If I now take the other perspective and talk about geographies, and I\u2019m going to start off with maybe the Americas. Our expectation, low single-digit growth in the Americas across the Brazilian end markets. The industrial sector also expected to be kind of flattish against what we see last year. I won\u2019t specifically talk about the U.S. though. And in the U.S., I\u2019d say to you, our current view remains, and I\u2019ve said this before, right, U.S. volumes and sales at a high watermark, our expectation remains that in the first half of the year, they\u2019re likely to be flattish.\n\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing from our customers. But towards the back end of the year, the second half was sure we are expecting increased momentum across the U.S., and we\u2019ll see that play through in how we see the Americas volumes and growth activity come through. On the other hand, a bit of a contrast unfortunately. In Europe, we expect to see continued softening. This is primarily in Western Europe, also a little bit in Eastern Europe, but primarily in Western Europe. The Brazilian end markets will continue to grow. There is a good trajectory there, and we\u2019ll expect that at [indiscernible] metals, manufacturing, chemicals, energy, all expected to be softer in lower volumes versus previous year. So Europe, unfortunately, is a drag at the moment.\n\nNow as far as Asia Pacific is concerned, I\u2019ll start off with China because I know that\u2019s on a number of your minds. I was in China 2 weeks ago, spent a week with the team talking to our customers, meeting a number of CEOs and getting a flavor of what I think is going to happen in China. And I think my short summary is, from our perspective, we don\u2019t expect anything significant in China in 2025. We\u2019re not baking in any kind of recovery. I think industrial volumes and activity will remain stable, but flat. No recovery in any of those sectors. Metals and Mining specifically is likely to be negative year-on-year for a number of reasons, driven partly by demand, but equally by some large turnarounds that our customers are taking in the course of the year.\n\nSo we kind of see that play in Q1 and Q2. But again, Metals and Mining unlikely to see any growth. The one sector in China that is growing today and will continue to grow is their electronic sector. A lot of energy and a lot of money has been put into that sector by the government as well. So we do expect that, that will play out and continue to see some level of growth. If I was looking at China a bit more broadly, I\u2019d say to you two trends of particular note coming out of my visit. The first that the government has recognized the need for support if it\u2019s got to get personal private consumption and the property market to pick up. It said a lot of things. Not enough stimulus has gone into the market. So we haven\u2019t seen any improvements other than the fact that in the last quarter, you saw a bit of improvement from industrial activity for exports.\n\nBut we haven\u2019t really seen private consumption pickup happen. Now there are all kinds of subsidies in place that they\u2019re putting out there is small, but hopefully, they will have an impact over a period of time. So I\u2019d say to you, I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath for 2025 in terms of improvement. But beyond that, longer term, certainly, we will see the China market stabilize and probably grow at a small pace than we used to. But certainly, we will expect to see growth come back. The rest of Asia Pacific is largely flat versus previous year, except for India, which is obviously the growth story at the moment. And again, given our strong presence in India, we are making the most of it winning more than our fair share. I feel really good about where that\u2019s going.\n\nThat\u2019s kind of a view around what we see across the world and expect in 2025.\n\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: It\u2019s David Huang here for Dave. What are your concerns if any of the [indiscernible] Linde play book will be now employed [indiscernible] products given the recent management change? I guess would that be a negative [indiscernible]? Has the shift away from focusing too much on mega projects? Could that change result in even more rational industry pricing environment?\n\nSanjiv Lamba: I didn\u2019t get your question entirely, but I\u2019m going to answer it anyway. Linde has a leadership position in the market because of a number of factors. I said in my prepared remarks, you cannot replicate, and I think Matt put it really nicely, you can try and copy but you can never really duplicate what Linde has developed over many decades. And that\u2019s built into our operating rhythm, its built into our performance culture. And more importantly, it is built into the networks that we have developed across the world where because of the network density we have, we\u2019re able to get the margin improvement that we see and, of course, command the strength of the relationship with the customer and have the pricing power we have.\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s demonstrated in the margin expansion that you\u2019ve consistently seen over the last 5 years. We will continue to work on that. What others will or won\u2019t work on really is a question you will need to address to them. But I think Linda is the market leader, and we will reflect that in the behaviors we put out there in the marketplace consistently.\n\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with BNP Paribas.\n\nLaurent Favre: Got a question on health care, where I think you\u2019ve been around 0% organic growth every quarter in 2024. I was wondering if you could talk about what you\u2019ve seen on price versus volumes? And if there\u2019s any specific area that is providing a big headwind? And I guess if you can expand into what you\u2019re thinking for 2025 for this one?\n\nSanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Laurent. You\u2019ve heard me say this before that in the health care space, we expect long-term kind of mid-single-digit growth, and that\u2019s what we would expect. Now you know the health care sector is made up of two subsegments, if you like. The hospital care business, which is growing reasonably well and well on its way. And then obviously, the home care business around the world, which tends to be moving forward as well. Now we have, as you\u2019re aware, from past calls, we have said that we were doing some portfolio rationalization in our home care business out of the U.S. And in many ways, what the numbers you\u2019re seeing at the moment are reflecting some of the rationalization that has been done in that link care business.\n\nThat is moving forward well. As you know, the Home Care business, in particular, given the inflationary environment that we see has to work really hard and productivity efforts. I\u2019m happy to see that at Lincare, we are really seeing that progress being made. So it\u2019s looking pretty robust and resilient as things stand. At some stage, we will lap these portfolio actions, and you will see the long-term kind of mid-single \u2014 low to mid-single-digit growth that we would expect from health care overall.\n\nLaurent Favre: And if I can have a follow-up on the project side, you talked mostly about decimalization related projects that would be signed in the future. You didn\u2019t mention electronics. Is there a specific reason for that? I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen significant new FIDs in electronics on your side over the last couple of years. Is this an area where we should be expecting new projects?\n\nSanjiv Lamba: So I\u2019ll only tell you that 20% of my all-time record sale of gas backlog is electronics. We are executing on electronics projects as we speak. And I\u2019m more than happy to tell you that we\u2019ll be announcing new wins very shortly as well. So I\u2019m not sure whether that question really addressed a specific point. But I think really good about electronics and our specific position in there. In fact, we took our board recently to the \u2014 to our Phoenix facility, which serves TSMC, which you know has been a very successful project for TSMC. So we feel really good about it. Executing a number of projects as we speak. They are starting up and providing impact, and we continue to win more than our fair share.\n\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas at JPMorgan.\n\nJeff Zekauskas: In 2024, your cash flow from operations was up 1%, even though your EPS grew about 10%. Was that a depressed number? And so when you look at 2025 and your EPS growth of 4% to 7%, is cash flow from operations going to grow higher or lower? And then secondly, in terms of market share in the overall industrial gas market, is market share pretty much constant for all of the major players? Or are you gaining share overall or losing share? Is there any share shift?\n\nSanjiv Lamba: Just \u2014 I\u2019ll let Matt talk about the cash flows, and then we\u2019ll talk about the market.\n\nMatthew White: Yes. Jeff. So on the OCF, to your point, we tend to look at EBITDA rates to OCF rates. So similar to what you were saying, but instead of EPS, EBITDA. And to your point, though, they should grow similarly. And the ratio we tend to always look to achieve on OCF to EBITDA is usually in the low 80s. And to your exact point, what we had occur over the last probably, I would say 24 months give or take, is this unwinding of our engineering portfolio as we worked out the sanctioned projects. And so what that created was you had a large influx of deposits of cash that stopped. And then we had to settle the payments to basically suppliers and you had a very rapid acceleration of an unwind. So that created a large outflow of cash associated with the engineering business.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what created a slower growth of OCF relative to EBITDA. Because essentially what you had was some liabilities, which are the contract liabilities, if you look at that specific line has been quite unfavorable. And what it is, is these liabilities are unwinding on the wind down, but they\u2019re not cash generative. So that\u2019s why they create that unfavorable aspect on the working capital line that you see. So that is what\u2019s been driving this inability for the EBITDA and OCF to grow together. We\u2019ve substantially gotten through all that. i our engineering business. I expect 2025 to be a lot closer aligned on those growth rates. But this is \u2014 normally, this is how the engineering percent completion business works. Normally, it\u2019s spread over a 4-year build cycle, so you don\u2019t notice it.\n\nBut given the events of the sanctioned projects, it got compressed into a much tighter structure as we had to deal with the sanction projects.\n\nSanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Matt. And let me talk about market share. So actually, Jeff, to be honest, we don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking and talking about market share. I think it\u2019s something that we can segment down and talk about specifics, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do for you. So I\u2019m going to start off by just reminding you record sale of gas backlog of $7-plus billion, right. Has a good test of where market share is headed. And to be honest, we\u2019re winning more than our fair share of those large projects, which are, as I\u2019ll remind you, and as we said in our prepared remarks, those are contracted growth with good solid terms and conditions, including termination guaranteeing a minimal return on capital that is guaranteed.\n\nSo just as a reminder, that very rigorous definition of backlog where we are excelling today with a record backlog that demonstrates on the larger project side and how we are positioned in terms of market share. For the merchant and package business, the concept of market share is less relevant. What is more important and which is where we spend most of our time is thinking about network density. Clearly, if you have network density, you are the leading player in that market usually by a mile. So it is very important to make sure that network density is what you try through the decisions you make, and in terms of how you manage your business on a day-to-day basis. So I feel pretty good about the network that we\u2019ve developed and the strength of our market position in each one of those networks, Ih actually results in, as I said earlier, getting the margin expansion that we look for and getting the market position and the strength of our relationship with our customers because of those networks that we\u2019ve developed.\n\nSo I\u2019ll just summarize by saying Linde remains a market leader, and we expect that leadership to continue to move forward given these elements that I just talked about.\n\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nSteve Byrne: I was wanting to better understand this the 59 small on-site wins. Maybe more specifically, how would you compare the contract terms of those small on-sites versus the long on sites. I would assume these are long-term take-or-pay agreements, some of them maybe even have your own employees on site. So how would you compare the returns on these projects versus the big ones? And is \u2014 can you comment on what are the gases that are driving these small on-sites, i.e., is this oxygen for oxyfuels or this hydrogen, et cetera?\n\nSanjiv Lamba: That\u2019s a fantastic question, Steve, and I really wanted somebody to raise it. So thanks for doing that. 59 long-term contracts, you would have read, we signed 59 long-term contracts and are building 64 plants. All of this happened in the space of the last 12 months. So feel really good about breaking that record. Now let\u2019s talk about the profile of the small onsite. I get excited about small on sites because from so many different perspectives, they are actually a perfect way of generating annuity income for this business. And you can imagine this building 64 plants will be starting out more than 1 plant a week to make sure that, that revenue and cash generation happens. Let\u2019s talk about returns, terms and conditions and the types of gases.\n\nSo I think good to start with the types of gases. We use both oxygen, nitrogen and indeed, in the future, we expect to see electrolyzer-based hydrogen, which is currently not included in our definition for smaller side wins. But at some stage, we\u2019ll see that as a developing portfolio element to be added on to the small onsite. Oxygen, nitrogen largely, obviously, I\u2019ll give you a great example. So we\u2019ve been working with many customers. I\u2019ll take one [indiscernible] on Illinois, where we\u2019ve been supporting them on their decarbonization efforts. And in this particular case, we have a piece of application technology called OptiMelt that we have developed, and we have deployed that successfully across a number of class customers, [indiscernible] being a good example of one of those where we are able to recover \u2014 do heat recovery, which allows them to get significant efficiencies, reduced natural gas consumption and run the throughput of their furnaces at a significantly higher level.\n\nThat\u2019s a good example of small on-site, goes on site, actually provide that. We do the same with paper and pulp. We do the same with electronics, et cetera, which is where we would largely use nitrogen as an example. So both of these gases drive our small onsite portfolio and are kind of largely equally split between the different technologies that we apply and win. The terms of these small on-site contracts range between 10 and 15 years exactly identical to what you would typically see on the large on-site piece, the terms and conditions are almost identical as well. Same fixed fee elements that we talk about similar profile in terms of cash flows. What tends to happen though is that the execution time line for these projects is much shorter.\n\nTypically, we\u2019d be able to deploy a small on-site anywhere between 9 to 15 months. As you know, the large on-site projects or the larger projects that we do tend to take longer in terms of their construction commissioning period. So again, a very, very nice piece often on the small on site, we\u2019re able to derisk the execution as well because the execution or a portion of the civil is carried out by the customer and again, helps us both implement and construct quickly but also have the customer take the risk around the civil piece as well. That brings me in the end to returns. And our returns typically above small on-sites are above what we would see on average for some of the large projects. So I feel really good about the return, highly accretive to our portfolio.\n\nAnd again, you\u2019ve been seeing over the last 4 or 5 years, we put a lot of focus on developing this part of the portfolio and are really seeing the benefits of that in the 59 long-term contract we signed and the 64 plants we\u2019re building up. All in, I think really a good part of the portfolio, we have very excited about it.\n\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Avi on for Mike. This was sort of touched on earlier in the call, but I wondered if you could just the contributions from pricing versus productivity and cost management when we\u2019re talking about forward-looking guidance for the quarter and for the year?\n\nMatthew White: Avi, it\u2019s Matt. So we don\u2019t split that out. But as Sanjiv mentioned on the algorithm. So we\u2019ve got 10-plus percent in the combination of the capital allocation contribution and the management action contribution. And for purposes of guidance, I\u2019d say roughly split 50-50, just say 5% at this stage. Historically, management actions have been the larger contribution. But we always need and want to think about that as a spread, right. To think about one in isolation to us doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense because you\u2019ll see very different inflation levels in different countries. So the local spread of price to cost inflation is a critical metric for us because that positive spread is what\u2019s part of the compound value creation of the model.\n\nSo I would say it\u2019s a very, very local discussion, but the spread needs to remain positive. That\u2019s a big component of the margin expansion, the long-term margin expansion as well. But I\u2019d say for purposes of the guidance right now, just assume it\u2019s roughly half from management actions at the 10% and half from capital allocation of the 10%, so 5 and 5 And as Sanjay mentioned, we\u2019re obviously going to continue to take actions to try and improve on that, but that\u2019s what\u2019s laid out in the guidance at this stage.\n\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nJohn McNulty: So a question around the $10 billion backlog between sale of gas and sale of equipment. How much of the equipment at this point is locked in, where we don\u2019t have to worry about tariffs or maybe the benefit of the strong dollar? And how much of it is there a little bit of exposure on? How should we be thinking about that?\n\nSanjiv Lamba: Thanks, John. So again, as you said, $10 billion in backlog, about $3.1 billion or $3.2 billion of that sits in the SOE side, the sale of equipment side, and the balance 7 plus sitting in the sale of CASA. So as far as tariffs are concerned, obviously, we\u2019ve been looking at the portfolio. On the SOE side, our contractual protection typically takes care of that. So we go in with firm pricing with our contractors and wherever necessary, we have contractual protection to make sure that events like tariffs, et cetera, get adequately covered. On the sale of gas side, where we\u2019re doing a lot of the procurement, we\u2019re obviously managing and tracking that quite closely. We did that study recently for our U.S. projects and actually the impact of the tariffs is de minimis.\n\nSo really, we are not seeing any impact there. Now our experience of the past has been, and there were tariffs \u2014 have been tariffs for a while now, including the first round of the administration a few years ago. When we dealt with this, one of the things we found was when tariffs did get introduced, typically, they didn\u2019t really impact our firm offers that we put in on the procurement cycle. But also more importantly, we got some benefit typically out of devaluation of currencies that more than offset the tariff impact, if there was impact of any significance. So all in, I\u2019d say to you, we\u2019ve looked at tariffs. It\u2019s part of what we\u2019ve done in the past. And kind of manage that adequately at this point in time, we feel pretty good about where our projects stand.\n\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Clark with Bernstein.\n\nPeter Clark: I hope I don\u2019t ask something that\u2019s been asked before. But I\u2019m not terribly surprised with your guidance, but maybe I was a bit off on the ForEx. And using the sales line, I guess, slightly lower, but I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve got some very profitable markets in there that are being hit very hard with the currency, I\u2019m thinking Mexico, maybe Brazil a bit. Just wondering if there\u2019s an element of that in that guidance? And then allied to that, the tariff risk. I know gases don\u2019t travel. I know it\u2019s mostly for customers in the region. But again, some of these very profitable markets are ones at risk in terms of tariffs. And again, Mexico would be a classic in terms of that. Just how you think around that as well?\n\nMatthew White: Peter it\u2019s Matt. So we\u2019ll start on the FX. Yes, you actually hit on the two bigger ones. Brazil and Mexico were the larger ones. I would say if you think about the evolution of FX through 2024, some of the European-based currencies, as you probably know, were almost quite favorable to flat in the beginning of 2024. But unfortunately, what you were seeing where a lot of Lat Am currencies devalue fairly materially. The peso, Mexico peso will be one, the Brazilian real and then Argentinian peso, as you can imagine, which is on a managed devaluation, which uses hypercurrency inflation. So the LatAm currencies we\u2019re probably seeing more of the brunt in the first half to 2/3 of the year. But what we saw in the fourth quarter, just given some of the geopolitical and political events was a significant flight to the dollar.\n\nI think DXY index is probably the best indicator of that. If you sort of look at DXY right around the beginning \u2014 or prior to the U.S. elections to where it ended in the year, it appreciated almost 10%. And I think you gave a pretty good indication of the 6 major basket currencies, of which that index is comprised of. How much those major currencies you saw that move. So that was, I would say, it was a 2-stage impact on the rates. And what that ended up with was some of the more larger currencies like the I and the sterling and the Aussie dollar, et cetera, really devalued in the back half of the fourth quarter. So that \u2014 I\u2019d say that was the dynamic we saw. It will be what it will be, right. We\u2019ll obviously, as we mentioned, you book on the average rate each month and then we\u2019ll see if the devaluations do create inflationary aspects.\n\nI think Sanjiv had mentioned the tariffs and as you can imagine, our impact on the tariffs is really indirect. We don\u2019t \u2014 since we\u2019re so localized to your point, we don\u2019t have much direct impact. Sanjiv mentioned the equipment, which is small, and that tends to self-correct. So it really just comes down to a function of the customers that we supply and what production levels they have. Given our leading density positions in a lot of these economies, we feel quite good that we are there to capture where the products move to because I think at the end of the day, which you have to ask yourself with these tariffs, is production shifting? Or will there be a reduction of production? But in a shifting basis, we feel quite good. We\u2019ll capture where it goes.\n\nAnd if there is a net reduction, the question will be from where. So time will tell on that, but this is more going to be a function of that IP we talked about, and we\u2019ll see how it plays out. But given the guide we gave on basically a zero IP at the midpoint, we\u2019ll have to see how things play on that.\n\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi.\n\nPatrick Cunningham: Just on the step-up in CapEx for 2025, is most of that being driven by the two large projects? And is this step-up from those projects more meaningful in 2026 as well?\n\nSanjiv Lamba: Patrick, the \u2014 we just referenced the sale of gas backlog being an all-time high at $7.1 billion clearly, that\u2019s the reason why you\u2019re seeing the step-up in CapEx. And obviously, sitting within that are the two large projects that we\u2019re executing around the clean energy piece, but also a number of electronics projects, et cetera. So that is really \u2014 that\u2019s all that\u2019s driving the CapEx number as things down.\n\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho.\n\nJohn Roberts: Your competitor had a large nonrecurring helium sale in the quarter. Does that take down industry helium prices? Or how would you characterize the helium market?\n\nSanjiv Lamba: John, I think the helium market continues to display exactly the characteristics that we\u2019ve been seeing for the most of 2024, in fact. As I look at the helium market today, I\u2019d say to you that there are parts of the world where helium is long. Asia is one of them. As you know, about 1/3 of all the imports into China coming out of Russia, which obviously has unbalance that market to some extent. The demand side on helium remains flattish. We see some softness around electronics and maybe MRI, but that tends to kind of pick up during the course of the year. Pricing as things stand remains stable. We are not seeing any significant movements on pricing. Corrections had happened, as you know, about a year or 18 months ago.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing unexpected happening. The \u2014 you\u2019re referencing a transaction that I won\u2019t comment on at this stage, but there are shifts in helium supply and demand all the time. There is nothing new happening over here that will impact the market itself.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research.\n\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Matt [indiscernible] on for Kevin McCarthy. Regarding the new CCS hub in Jabal, could you provide more details on the scope and structure of your investment in the project? How large is the investment? And do you see this project being foundational in nature in that it could turn into a base hub for additional follow-on investments with the goal of increasing regional asset density?\n\nSanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Matt. So essentially, I\u2019m going to give you a high-level view of the project. It hasn\u2019t gone to FID when it does, you will hear us talk a bit more about it. But essentially, it\u2019s a 3-way joint venture that is developing, which will be in its first phase, a very large CCS project in Saudi. The 3 partners are led by Saudi Aramco, SRB and Linde. Each kind of contributing their skill set into that project. The first phase of the project is between 9 million to 11 million tonnes per annum of CO2 being sequester. There is an expectation that there will be 2 more phases by the end of the third phase when it gets completed, this could well be the world\u2019s largest CCS project at 54 million or 53 million tonnes per annum of CO2 being captured and sequester.\n\nSo yes, there is potential for growth beyond. Obviously, we will assess those phases when they happen. At this point in time, this joint venture structure is developing the project. The feed has been completed. The capital is being assessed as we speak. So I\u2019m not going to give you a firm number just yet. I expect FID in the next few months. And once that happens, you\u2019ll get a lot more detail around it. But it is a fairly significant project with some exceptional partners in a part of the world where Linde will strengthen its position. And obviously, there will be a future opportunity to continue to grow with this. Alongside this project, we will also look at developing a blue hydrogen project, which was leverage the CCS infrastructure that has been developed in this project.\n\nBut again, when that goes to FID in due course and meets our investment criteria, and we have a project worth talking about. You\u2019ll hear us talk a bit more about that.\n\nOperator: And we will now take our final question from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.\n\nDaniel Rizzo: This is Dan Rizzo for Laurence. I was just wondering what your view is on the depth of the pipeline of potential hydrogen projects, particularly in the EU and Japan?\n\nSanjiv Lamba: So I said this earlier, and I\u2019m going to maybe just quickly recap my earlier comments and then talk specifically about the markets you\u2019ve mentioned. So we have seen that people are being more rigorous and applying more diligence before they take on FID decisions for these large projects. And when I think about our pipeline and the context of that, I feel really good about the strength of the high-quality projects we have in our pipeline that we are developing. We\u2019re developing those projects, as you would expect in the U.S., in Canada, so in North America, in the Middle East, largely in Saudi Arabia, but also potentially in [indiscernible] in Europe, particularly with partners like Equinor, where potentially we have an opportunity to provide low carbon hydrogen or blue hydrogen into the European network.\n\nAnd then we are looking at some projects in Asia which are localized for local markets. Your specific question around Europe and Japan, I would say to you that the projects in Japan are minimal other than the fact that Japan is a very important market from an import perspective that they would want to import in either clean hydrogen or derivatives such as ammonia methanol into their market for a host of applications that they have determined are needed for their decarbonization effort. So everybody is looking at Far East from a point of ability to export into that market, which is why it remains an important market alongside Japan [indiscernible] Korea as well. But the development itself in Japan, I think, is minimal. As far as Europe is concerned, obviously, you see a lot of discussion around clean hydrogen in Europe, including green and including blue and so on and so forth.\n\nThe reality is that the regulatory framework is so difficult that to be able to get to a decision point and a very large substantive investment requires a lot of time, and I think we\u2019re seeing that play out in Europe as things stand, which is why there is a real feel that the European aspirations for the amount of hydrogen they need for that market will not be entirely met because the combination of the time to kind of decipher the regulatory framework and to make investment decisions in this environment is obviously a little more challenging.\n\nOperator: And I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Juan Pelaez for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nJuan Pelaez: Abby, thank you, and thank you, everyone, for participating in today\u2019s call. If you have any further questions, feel reach out directly. Take care.\n\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

While it exceeded bottom-line estimates by reporting earnings per share (EPS) of $3.97 against the $3.94 that analysts forecast, it fell short on revenue, posting $8.28 billion compared to the expected $8.42 billion.\n\nMetric Q4 2024 Q4 2024 Analysts' Estimate Q4 2023 % Change EPS $3.97 $3.94 $3.57 11.2% Revenue $8.28 billion $8.42 billion $8.30 billion 0.2% Adjusted operating profit $2.48 billion N/A $2.27 billion 9.3% Free cash flow $1.56 billion N/A $1.58 billion (1.1%)\n\nAn Overview of Linde\u2019s Business\n\nLinde is the world\u2019s largest industrial gas company, offering a comprehensive range of gases used in diverse industries. Its core business revolves around atmospheric gases like oxygen and nitrogen, and process gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen. These are vital in sectors including healthcare, chemicals, manufacturing, and electronics. The company is also a pioneer in innovative gas technologies, which enhance its service delivery.\n\nIn recent times, Linde has focused on the clean energy sector and long-term customer agreements. It has been strengthening its technological edge, as evidenced by its developments in hydrogen solutions and advanced gas processing techniques. Its vast market reach and proprietary technologies have been key to its success.\n\nQuarterly Highlights and Strategic Developments\n\nThe fourth-quarter results highlighted Linde\u2019s capability to manage costs effectively, as its adjusted operating profit margin rose 2.5 percentage points to 29.9%.\n\nSales in the Americas grew by 1%, fueled by sectors including manufacturing, food, and electronics. The Asia-Pacific region experienced a 2% sales hike due to growth in the electronics sector. However, in the Europe/Middle East/Africa region, sales dropped by 2%, which the company attributed to reduced manufacturing volumes. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively influenced these outcomes.\n\nLinde remains proactive in clean energy, having signed a substantial $2 billion contract with chemical giant Dow. This partnership reflects the company\u2019s commitment to growing through strategic alliances. Additionally, its project backlog -- now over $10 billion -- points to significant future earnings growth prospects.\n\nLinde returned $1.99 billion to its shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases during the quarter.\n\nOutlook and Future Considerations\n\nLinde has projected its 2025 adjusted diluted EPS will land between $16.15 and $16.55, indicating anticipated growth of 8% to 11% when excluding foreign currency impacts. Such guidance reflects Linde's confidence in its ability to navigate expected macroeconomic challenges while maintaining its strategic focus on technological advancements and energy solutions.\n\nInvestors should focus on Linde's endeavors in clean energy projects and its ability to secure long-term contracts. With its commitment to innovation and strategic market position, Linde is well positioned to leverage its assets for consistent growth.",

            "content": "Linde 's earnings Thursday was a great example of why investors should always wait to hear from management before making any moves. Shares of the industrial gas giant fell after delivering a softer forecast than Wall Street expected \u2014 and is accustomed to. But the stock clawed its way back up during the post-earnings call once investors better understood management's outlook, including some conservatism embedded in the assumptions. Revenue in the fourth quarter dipped 0.2% to $8.28 billion, slightly missing estimates of $8.4 billion expected by analysts, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 0.8% year over year to $3.97, topping expectations by 4 cents, LSEG data showed. Linde (LIN) Why we own it: The industrial gas supplier and engineering firm has a stellar track record of consistent earnings growth. Its exposure to a wide range of industries, such as health care and electronics, and geographies \u2014 paired with excellent executive leadership and disciplined capital management \u2014 has been a recipe for steady success that should continue. Competitors: Air Liquid and Air Products Most recent buy : Dec. 18, 2024 Initiated : Feb. 18, 2021 Bottom line Linde shares have had a volatile Thursday. The stock traded lower for most of pre-market trading and fell as low as $450 per share around the opening bell in immediate reaction to the 2025 forecast. However, the stock has fought its way to positive territory after investors digested the conference call and got a better understanding of management's outlook. Indeed, Linde's forecasted earnings growth for 2025 is below the 10% we're used to seeing the company put up year in and year out. But the company isn't benefiting from volume growth, with management estimating a base volume range of negative 2% to 2% for this year. Additionally, currency is a significant headwind, dragging earnings down by an estimated 4% this year. However, management was quick to remind investors that this is simply a forecast and doesn't reflect potential incremental pricing opportunities to offset these headwinds. \"Historically, large currency devaluations have often been followed by periods of more significant local inflation, with 2022 being a recent example\" CFO Matt White said. \"If that occurs, I'd anticipate incremental pricing opportunities to recover the currency devaluation impact. These potential pricing opportunities are not baked into the guidance range at this time, since the amount or timing of subsequent inflation is difficult to estimate.\" This comment made us feel better about Linde's outlook being a starting point for the year and not completely hostage to currency fluctuations. Linde may not have control over currency and global industrial production, but the company continues to operate at a high level. The company-wide margin improvement was impressive, expanding to nearly 30% from 27.4%. And the company just wrapped up a year in which it signed a huge number of projects and increased its backlog to over $10 billion. On the call, management was very proud of the 59 small on-site wins Linde signed in 2024. \"I get excited about small on-sites because from so many different perspectives, they are actually a perfect way of generating annuity income for this business,\" White explained. We reiterate our 1 rating and our $500 price target. LIN 1Y mountain Linde stock 1-year performance Quarterly commentary By end market, food and beverage had the strongest year-over-year sales growth, increasing by 6%. Next was a tie between electronics and manufacturing, both up 4%. Metals and mining increased 2%, while health care and chemicals and energy were both flat. By region, Americas was the bright spot, with sales up 1% year over year, driven by 1% volume growth, a 2% benefit from price and mix, a 3% decline from currency (Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina), and a 1% boost from acquisitions. Margins were strong as well, expanding to nearly 32% thanks to continued price and productivity initiatives. The volume growth was driven by manufacturing, electronics, and chemicals and energy. Europe is a murkier picture. Sales from the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region fell 2% year over year due to a 2% decline in volume, a 3% benefit from price and mix, and a 2% decline from cost pass-through, and a 1% headwind from currency. Despite the soft sales, margins were very strong, increasing 330 basis points from last year due to strong pricing and productivity initiatives. The company expects to see conditions continue to soften, primarily in Western Europe, though Eastern Europe has its challenges, too. The weakness is mostly coming from the cyclical complex, with metals, manufacturing, chemicals, and energy expected to have lower volumes. Resilient end markets are expected to continue to grow. Asia-Pacific missed estimates but still delivered revenue and margin growth. Sales increased 2% year over year, driven by a 1% increase in volumes thanks to project startups, mostly in the electronics industry. There was also a 1% positive impact from cost pass-through. Margins expanded 240 basis points year over year to 30%, driven by what the company described as \"good cost management.\" For 2025, the company is not forecasting any significant recovery in China. The company expects most sectors in the country to be either stable or down except for the electronics sector, which they said will continue to grow. Outlook For 2025, Linde forecasted adjusted earnings per share in the range of $16.15 to $16.55, representing an increase of 4% to 7% over 2024's level. The $16.35 midpoint of the outlook range is well below the FactSet consensus estimate of $16.81. One big factor to keep in mind is the impact of the strong U.S. dollar. Linde estimates a 4% year-over-year currency headwind to 2025 EPS. When excluding the impact of currency, Linde's earnings growth forecast is back in its typical range of 8% to 11%. As usual, the midpoint of Linde's outlook assumes no economic improvement. That means if the economy does a little better, we would expect earnings at the high end of the range. Should economic conditions worsen, Linde's earnings could fall toward the bottom end of the range, but we would likely see support from mitigating actions by management and share repurchases.

            "content": "Linde (LIN) came out with quarterly earnings of $3.97 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.93 per share. This compares to earnings of $3.59 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.02%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this gas supplier would post earnings of $3.89 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.94, delivering a surprise of 1.29%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nLinde , which belongs to the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry, posted revenues of $8.28 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.89%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $8.3 billion. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nLinde shares have added about 8.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3.1%.\n\nWhat's Next for Linde?\n\nWhile Linde has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Linde: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4 on $8.47 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $16.73 on $34.42 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Foreign Stocks With Dividends For Passive Income. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) stands against the other foreign stocks.\n\nIn August, S&P Global Market Intelligence reported that US dividends are set to grow around 5.1% by the close of 2024. In the United States, the energy sector dominated dividend contributions, with pharmaceuticals, financial services, and banks trailing behind. Looking beyond the US, we see similar growth trends in international markets. For example, S&P expects a 3.9% year-over-year recovery in dividends in Canada, resulting in $74.4 billion in dividend payouts for 2024. Interest rate cuts by the Bank of Canada will aid this rebound in dividends. Two-thirds of the overall Canadian dividend distributions are attributed to the financial and energy sectors.\n\nBy year-end 2024, European dividends are projected to grow 4.2% year-over-year to $531.5 billion, with the banking and insurance sectors leading the charge and counteracting the weakness in the European transportation, materials, and energy industries. In the Asia-Pacific region, dividend growth is also projected to be strong. Developed markets in the Asia-Pacific \u2013 Australia, Japan, Hong Kong SAR, New Zealand, South Korea, and Singapore \u2013 are expected to grow their dividends to $370.5 billion by the end of 2024, reflecting a 5.8% year-over-year increase. According to S&P Global, 2024 is the year that Japan will overtake Hong Kong SAR in terms of the highest dividend contributions in the developed Asia-Pacific market, with an expected growth rate of over 10% for the year.\n\nTurning back to Canada, Ryan Bushell, president and portfolio manager at Newhaven Asset Management, joined BNN Bloomberg on February 4 and discussed the Canadian stock market outlook. He commented that the current hostility from the US should be a wake-up call for Canadian policymakers, noting that it is impractical to isolate the US but Canada should have alternative trading partners in case political tensions influence economic decisions. Bushell mentioned that having export options other than oil is crucial and that Canada should look into exporting natural gas and liquefied petroleum gases as well. In terms of investment strategies, the portfolio manager emphasized that sustainable and stable companies make for excellent long-term investments, regardless of who occupies the White House. This includes critical infrastructure companies, which cater to people\u2019s needs rather than wants. He went on to recommend his top stock picks, which were companies with steady dividend policies, high yields, and 40-60% of their revenues coming from the US, to navigate the messy tariffs. Bushnell prefers Canadian energy stocks since these companies are seeking to export to more countries, which will result in higher gains.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to filter out dividend stocks listed on US exchanges but headquartered internationally. We focused on picking stocks with a consistent record of paying dividends, offering dividend growth, and being financially stable to steer clear of yield traps. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of Q3 2024 hedge fund sentiment, and dividend yields are mentioned as of February 3.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here)\n\nLinde plc (NASDAQ:LIN)\n\nDividend Yield as of February 3: 1.25%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 63\n\nLinde plc (NASDAQ:LIN), a UK-based industrial gas company, ranks 3rd on our list of the best foreign stocks for an income portfolio. The company operates worldwide, offering a variety of gases including oxygen, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, and acetylene.\n\nIn August 2024, Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) entered a long-term agreement with Dow\u2019s Fort Saskatchewan Path2Zero Project to provide clean hydrogen. Per the agreement, Linde will spend over $2 billion to construct and operate an Alberta-based clean hydrogen and atmospheric gas site. This will be one of the largest global industrial facilities and is expected to be completed in 2028.\n\nDuring Q3 2024, North America remained a positive contributor in Linde plc\u2019s (NASDAQ:LIN) portfolio, accounting for 40% of the company\u2019s global sales. However, EMEA and parts of APAC (mainly China), were impacted by geopolitical tensions and economic turbulence. The company\u2019s operating cash came in at $2.7 billion in Q3, which was 8% higher than the same quarter last year and 42% more than in Q2 2024. The company expects similar operating cash flow in Q4. Linde injected capital worth $3.4 billion into its business while giving $5.1 billion back to shareholders. LIN aims to maintain a single A credit rating and raise dividends annually, with 2024 being the 31st consecutive year that the company increased its payouts.\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter database shows that 63 Wall Street funds held long positions in Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN), the same as the prior quarter.\n\nOverall LIN ranks 3rd on our list of the best foreign stocks with dividends for passive income. While we acknowledge the potential of LIN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LIN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The PVV Minister is paying the spokesperson out of his own pocket, the Ministry and the spokesperson involved, Kay van de Linde, confirmed to BNR.\n\nFor Beljaarts, Van der Linde\u2019s only job is to communicate about the bankruptcy of KHN Rekenwerk, an accountancy service of which Beljaarts was a director. FD discovered that customers lost hundreds of thousands of euros when Beljaarts\u2019 company went under. There are also rumors of fraudulent conduct within the KHN Rekenwerk board.\n\nSpokespersons for the Ministry of Economic Affairs do not answer questions about KHN Rekenwerk. A ministerial spokesperson told BNR that this decision was made \u201cin good consultation\u201d with Beljaarts because the bankruptcy \u201chappened before Mr. Beljaarts took office as a Minister in this Cabinet and this is not related to the exercise of his office.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to BNR, other Cabinet members have received assistance from civil servants in similar private matters. For example, civil servants spoke for State Secretary Vicky Maeijer (PVV) when she was in disrepute because of copied texts in her master\u2019s thesis last year. And State Secretary Raymond Knops (CDA) received similar support in 2020 when NRC reported critically on a land deal in which he was involved.\n\nBeljaarts decision to outsource his spokesperson duties also means that communications between him and this spokesperson do not fall under the Open Government Act, which makes them confidential in principle. However, according to public administration professor Paul \u2018t Hart, Beljaarts may still have to answer to parliament for statements made by Van der Linde.\n\nAlbertjan Tollenaar, a professor of local government and law, thinks that outsourcing this spokesperson is a risky move, especially due to the possibility of criminal behavior in the bankruptcy case. \u201cThe line between personal and public is not so easy to draw,\u201d he told BNR. \u201cThis would keep me up at night if I were Dick Schoof.\u201d",

            "content": "SHANNON CURTIS, Senior Manager, Technology Solutions & Marketing, The Raymond Corporation\n\nLOREN SWAKOW, Managing Director, Noblelift North America\n\nQ: HOW DO YOU VIEW THE CURRENT LIFT TRUCK MARKET?\n\nShannon Curtis \u2013 Raymond: Consumers are clamoring for innovation in the food supply chain sphere in 2025. From a greater emphasis on convenience to a renewed desire for operational efficiency and security, new preferences call for a shift from tried-and-true procedures to innovative business models that champion modernization\u2014the adoption of which can help organizations stand out as technological and cultural leaders in the new year and beyond.\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: I think it is still a strong and viable market\u2014[there are] always new opportunities. When the new additional tariffs come in, we shall see how that affects the total market. I think the demand for used equipment will go up. Users will have X amount of dollars to invest in equipment, and if the Chinese, Canadian, and/or Mexican product [costs] gets pushed higher, the user does not necessarily have more money available. I am not sure sales of American-made lift trucks will increase.\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: It\u2019s safe to say the industrial lift truck market has been somewhat volatile the last five years, with the market reaching all-time highs during the pandemic years, [then experiencing] massive swings downward these past two. While most lift truck OEMs enjoyed the spike in sales, the enormous demand put a significant strain on the supply chain, pushing leadtimes out to unprecedented levels while simultaneously driving up costs. The significant market decline is something no CEO in this industry would boast about. The fall we are experiencing today is better viewed as a normalization or correction to a market that was way overinflated.\n\nWith all the pent-up demand from the excessive orders due to the elongated pandemic leadtimes, we are now experiencing an abundance of stock on hand at both the OEM and distribution levels. On the surface, a market that\u2019s quickly becoming half of what it was two years ago looks catastrophic. However, when you compare it to what\u2019s happened over the past 15 years, today\u2019s market still looks relatively healthy.\n\nQ: WILL 2025 AND THE HOPES OF LOWER INTEREST RATES SPUR INVESTMENTS IN NEW INDUSTRIAL TRUCKS?\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: It will not hurt, but I do not think interest rates hinder sales. One point [in the interest rate] in either direction has a small impact on the payment. A rate reduction can be used as a marketing tool, though. If rates decline, dealers can go back over their outstanding quotes, refigure the payments, and present a new monthly cost to the user.\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: There are many factors, including interest rates, that play a role in the level of investment in industrial truck fleets. Most significant of those factors is consumer confidence. Logically, when consumers are confident, they buy more, which means manufacturers will have to make more and lift trucks will have to move more.\n\nWhile inflation and high interest rates have surely stifled consumer confidence these past four years, there are signs that a new, more business-friendly administration will work in conjunction with lower interest rates to help drive up consumer confidence. Lower interest rates will work hand in hand with that resurgence in consumer confidence to help drive more investment in industrial equipment.\n\nQ: WILL THE NEW ADMINISTRATION\u2019S PROPOSED TARIFFS HURT OR HELP YOUR BRANDS?\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: The industrial lift truck market is one that is very global in nature, with a complex supply chain and operations scattered throughout the world. The tariffs that are being proposed on countries like Canada, Mexico, and China will undoubtedly have an impact on the industrial market, depending on the manufacturer. All lift truck manufacturers will experience varying levels of impact due to the tariffs, but tariffs are designed to incentivize companies to re-evaluate their supply chains and bring more manufacturing capacity back to the United States, which is a good thing.\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: As we represent a Chinese manufacturer, the tariff increase will have an effect. We are currently paying 25%. An additional 10% (as of the last reports) is manageable. It is a world economy. Adding the tariff just adds cost to the product here in the U.S. China does not pay it; the dealers do. We have no choice but to pass on this added cost. To reduce the costs of tariffs, manufacturers will move production to a country that does not have a tariff. Even though labor costs will be higher, it will not add more than the proposed tariff to the cost of the machine.\n\nThe factory will look for new countries to manufacture in as well. If tariffs had come in at 60% per campaign promises, it would have been disastrous. We probably would have moved manufacturing to Vietnam or another Asian country immediately.\n\nQ: THE MARKET HAS BEEN MOVING TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN RECENT YEARS. DO YOU THINK THIS WILL CONTINUE, OR WILL THE ADVENT OF A MORE FOSSIL FUEL-FRIENDLY ADMINISTRATION DRIVE MORE DEMAND FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION (IC) TRUCKS?\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: The states have a bigger say in this than the federal government. Look at California as an example. With the advent of lithium as a safe and effective power solution, and with the price of lithium batteries coming down, I think [the use of] electric vehicles will continue to expand. Total cost of ownership is already much lower on electric when compared to IC product.\n\nWe continue to see electric product increasing every year. It is more sustainable, and it has now reached a point where cost is not a barrier to entry. Power and force have been overcome; we produce an electric rough-terrain lift truck that has a 50-degree gradeability.\n\nUsers will look at their own requirements, costs, etc., before deciding on IC or electric. I do not think the new administration will be able to justify the additional cost needed to use IC products. Electric is the future of material handling.\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: As anyone involved with the industrial lift truck market knows, California has been the driving force behind the electrification of the market, forcing organizations that operate in that state away from lift trucks that run on fossil fuels. While there have been no changes in the stringent regulations being imposed by the California Zero Emission Forklift Initiative, which essentially prohibits the sale of most spark-ignited internal combustion forklifts starting in 2026, there are many that expect an easing of such regulations.\n\nYet, aside from the legislative pressures, there continues to be a strong value proposition for making the switch to electric. Technological advancements in lift truck systems, battery technology, and charging platforms have all combined to make moving to electric more feasible than ever before; we are one of the only westernized nations who still use combustion engine equipment indoors. This is a welcome change for both warehouse employees and the environment.\n\nShannon Curtis \u2013 Raymond: The industry is embracing alternative fuel and energy sources. One viable option is lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with certification from Underwriters Laboratories. While lithium-ion technology is already a proven solution in the industry, offering superior performance and longer life spans than traditional lead-acid batteries, The Raymond Corporation sees UL-compliant LIBs playing a pivotal role in meeting new regulatory standards. These batteries not only help reduce emissions but also improve the operational efficiency of the material handling, manufacturing, and warehousing industries.\n\nQ: LIFT TRUCKS ARE USED FOR MANY TASKS, BUT ARE THERE ANY APPLICATIONS THAT ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO CUSTOMERS?\n\nShannon Curtis \u2013 Raymond: Today, organizations are aiming innovations in lift truck technologies to increase uptime, improve speed and mobility, streamline diagnostic procedures, and lower operating and energy costs\u2014dramatically cutting consumption without reducing productivity. And it\u2019s not just the forklift technologies that are evolving. The systems that warehouse managers rely on to manage and maintain their trucks\u2014including operator-assist and data collection technologies\u2014are also growing increasingly advanced.\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: E-commerce has fueled growth in the last few years. I believe it is here to stay. If anything, it will expand. All these products come from warehouses that need material handling machines. Every product we touch, including food, is probably moved at one point by a lift truck. We need to move products from one location to another, and trucks must be loaded and then unloaded at their destination. Lift trucks perform this function.\n\nWe are seeing continued expansion of Class III product [electric hand trucks and hand/rider trucks]. Walkie products move material but cannot stack it. Companies are realizing most of their need is for movement. For example, [a company may] have always used three lift trucks [that can both move and stack product] in its warehouse, when it only needs to have one truck [that\u2019s capable of both moving and stacking product] along with two trucks [that just] move material, which includes loading and unloading at the dock.\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: Labor constraints today have been a significant challenge for operations that require the use of lift trucks. With the massive movement to e-commerce, there is a much higher need for lift truck operators in warehousing and distribution environments. The lack of skilled labor has really pressured companies to invest in technologies that help operations accomplish more with less. As a result, more and more operations are looking to [incorporate] various levels of automation into their industrial lift truck fleets.\n\nQ: DO YOU SEE ROBOTICS SOLUTIONS AS COMPETITIVE WITH FORKLIFTS OR COMPLEMENTARY TO THEM?\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: For many years, the industrial lift truck manufacturers viewed automation and AGV [automatic guided vehicle] companies as competitors, but we\u2019ve experienced a significant change in thinking over the past decade. What was a threat has now become a strength for the lift truck manufacturers. Almost all lift truck manufacturers today have expanded their technology capabilities to such a level that they are now able to offer automated versions of their standard equipment with improved ROI [return on investment] calculations.\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: They are complementary. Most AGV solutions are based on a forklift of some type. We will just be building different types of forklifts. The goal of robotics is to take out the labor cost of the driver. The operator is by far the most expensive component of material handling.\n\nSupport of your AGV will determine the success of the project. Dealer networks will be the key here. There are more and more companies getting into the AGV market, but can they support it after the sale?\n\nRepetitive moves or long distances are the easiest [places] to remove the driver from the equation. If the unit goes down because of programming or mechanics, you must be able to get it back up operating as soon as possible. Dealer network and aftersales support should be a major component of the decision to take advantage of the benefits of AGV material handling.\n\nShannon Curtis \u2013 Raymond: Robots have been used in warehouses for decades, but in recent years, \u201ccobots\u201d have become even more complementary in the warehouse and instrumental in providing great levels of efficiency. From improved security and increased productivity to increased accuracy and lower costs, cobots are becoming an increasingly important part of warehouse operations.\n\nQ: TODAY\u2019S INDUSTRIAL TRUCKS OFFER MORE SAFETY FEATURES THAN EVER BEFORE. WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SAFETY DEVELOPMENTS OF THE PAST FIVE YEARS?\n\nShannon Curtis \u2013 Raymond: One of the most significant advancements in warehouse operations involves the implementation of virtual reality (VR) simulators. The technology can help new forklift operators develop the skills they need to succeed on the warehouse floor without impacting day-to-day operations, while also serving as a reinforcement tool for experienced operators. VR simulators serve as flexible, scalable teaching tools that rely on advanced technology to help workforces become more efficient and expand operator skills, creating optimized conditions for all employees.\n\nIn addition, training reinforcement offerings\u2014like integrated equipment detection and notification systems and operator tether systems\u2014can similarly help warehouse operators improve their work environment. Systems like these use intelligent speed limitations, real-time object detection, operator notifications, and more to improve employee awareness of their environment even in high-traffic areas.\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: With advancements in technology, all lift truck manufacturers are playing their part in developing new technologies that allow for the safe operation of their equipment. While there are various means in which manufacturers have applied these technologies, there is no substitute for a sound operator safety training program. [Ensuring that your operators receive the proper training] will always be the number-one way to reduce the likelihood of workplace incidents involving lift trucks. In addition to having fully trained operators, many manufacturers offer optional operator-assistance systems that may improve workplace safety for both the operator and those working around lift trucks.\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: When I started in this business, we were selling used trucks without overhead guards. They were produced without them. The load backrest was not a given. Seat belts were nonexistent.\n\nThere have been so many great advancements in safety, it is hard to pick just one. We are incorporating AI [artificial intelligence] into our equipment now. This will recognize a person in the area and warn the driver. Besides changing the physical attributes of the lift truck to make it safer for the operator, we will see more and more technology and AI in the pursuit of making it safer for the pedestrian.\n\nQ: WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF LEASING VERSUS BUYING FOR COMPANIES LOOKING TO ACQUIRE NEW TRUCKS?\n\nLoren Swakow \u2013 Noblelift: This is an age-old question. It really depends on the user. It is a function of cash flow and cash balances in each company. Leases can be expensed, while purchases need to be capitalized. Not only are we looking at the cash position, but we also now need to review our profit position. The user needs a lift truck, but does he need to capitalize it because profit is low, or does he need to expense it to decrease his profit and reduce the taxes on the company?\n\nEvery company is different, [but either way,] you will have outflow of cash and a new lift truck on the floor producing for you. The question is which method benefits the organization the most.\n\nShannon Curtis \u2013 Raymond: Today\u2019s electric forklifts offer performance that meets the needs of the most common lift truck applications, but with dramatically reduced maintenance requirements and with data collection capabilities that are quickly becoming essential to facility and resource optimization. Although the total cost of ownership of electric products is typically lower than for internal combustion products, the higher upfront initial purchase cost of switching to electric-powered equipment may have been a barrier in the past. Currently available governmental incentives and supplier programs, like leasing, make battery power\u2014specifically, the traditionally more expensive lithium-ion power\u2014even easier to justify.\n\nMartin Boyd \u2013 Big Joe: When it comes to the lease vs. buy decision, each organization needs to evaluate several factors when considering what\u2019s right for their application and company.\n\nIn leasing, you enjoy a lower cost per month and can be flexible on the terms of the lease. If you have a high-use environment, where you may need to renew equipment more often, leasing clearly has its advantages. In addition, a lease is often treated as an operating expense on the income statement, while a financed forklift is considered an asset on the balance sheet with depreciation expense recorded each period.",

However, before that, it would be worth reviewing LIN\u2019s performance in the previous quarter.\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nHighlights of Q3 Earnings & Surprise History\n\nIn the last reported quarter, Linde\u2019s earnings of $3.94 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89 owing to higher pricing from the Americas segment.\n\nLinde\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 1.84%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nLinde PLC Price and EPS Surprise\n\nLinde PLC Price and EPS Surprise\n\nLinde PLC price-eps-surprise | Linde PLC Quote\n\nEstimate Revision\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $3.93 has witnessed two downward revisions and no upward revision in the past 30 days. The bottom-line estimate implies an improvement of 9.47% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $8.36 billion indicates a year-over-year improvement of 0.65%.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nLinde\u2019s long-term contracts with major on-site clients are anticipated to have aided its performance in the fourth quarter. As a global manufacturer of industrial gases that caters to various industries, the company is likely to have generated profit from its Americas business unit, which should have supported its earnings.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating profit in the Americas segment is pegged at $1.15 billion, up from $1.07 billion reported in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nHowever, challenges are likely to have loomed due to an economic slowdown, particularly in Europe and China that might have affected industrial output. This is likely to have dampened the demand for industrial gases, which might have affected Linde\u2019s revenues. Furthermore, increasing energy prices due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East must have further affected margins.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the operating profit of the Engineering business unit is pegged at $106 million, down from $119 million a year ago.\n\nThese factors are anticipated to have affected demand and pricing dynamics, which might have adversely impacted LIN\u2019s financial performance in the quarter.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Linde this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.",

Team WRT achieved an impressive 1-2 result with the BMW M4 GT3 at the Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS), the season opener of the Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC). Brothers Sheldon and Kelvin van der Linde (both RSA) triumphed alongside Augusto Farfus (BRA) in car #32. Following them, Valentino Rossi (ITA), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Charles Weerts (BEL) in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 secured second place. It was the first victory for BMW M Motorsport in the GT3 era at the Mount Panorama Circuit. Team WRT remains undefeated in the 2025 season after successes at the 24h Dubai and the 6h Abu Dhabi (both UAE). On the sidelines of the race at Bathurst, the new BMW M3 CS Touring celebrated its world premiere .\n\nTeam WRT owed its 1-2 finish primarily to a perfect race strategy. Throughout the race, the two BMW M4 GT3s consistently gained an advantage in fuel consumption, which ultimately decided victory or defeat. While most competitors had to pit for refuelling just before the end, both BMW M4 GT3s were able to continue without stopping. Car #46 temporarily fell back to eighth place due to a drive-through penalty but fought its way back onto the podium. Marciello secured second place with a spectacular overtaking manoeuvre against Jules Gounon (Mercedes).\n\nBMW M Motorsport won at Bathurst for the first time after numerous attempts since GT3 cars have been competing there. The last triumph dates back to 2010 with a BMW 335i. For the Van der Linde brothers, it was their first joint victory in a BMW M Motorsport car, and for Rossi, it was his first podium at the Bathurst 12 Hour.\n\nWorld premiere of the new BMW M3 CS Touring.\n\nBorn on the racetrack, made for the street: BMW M\u2019s philosophy came to life on Thursday ahead of the Bathurst 12 Hour. In the Mount Panorama Circuit pit lane, the first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring celebrated its world premiere, presented by Sylvia Neubauer, Vice President Customer, Brand, and Sales at BMW M GmbH. The iconic racetrack provided the perfect stage for the debut of the latest BMW M special-edition model in the high-performance sports car sector. A 405 kW six-cylinder in-line engine, bespoke chassis tuning, exclusive design features and weight savings resulting from the use of numerous carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) components provide the ingredients for an unadulterated racing-car feel.\n\nReactions after the Bathurst 12 Hour:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \u201cCongratulations to Team WRT on the long-awaited Bathurst victory! It was our third attempt with the BMW M4 GT3, and after coming close last year, we finally made it! I am very happy for the Van der Linde brothers that they can celebrate a victory in their first race sharing a car for BMW M Motorsport. I am also pleased for Augusto Farfus, who can add another prestigious triumph to his illustrious career as a BMW M works driver. Valentino Rossi, Raffaele Marciello, and Charles Weerts also did a great job in the sister car. It's a pity that a penalty cost them a chance of victory. Team WRT remains undefeated this year after victories at the 24h Dubai and the 6h Abu Dhabi. Hopefully, this is a good omen for the rest of the season! Thank you to all the drivers, team members, and BMW M Motorsport employees who made this outstanding season start possible.\u201d\n\nVincent Vosse, Team Principal Team WRT: \u201cThree races, three wins. What an amazing start of the season! We tried to win at Bathurst with BMW M Motorsport for the last two years, but it never worked out. This time, everything was just spot on. This is a big race everyone wants to win, so I could not be happier. A special congrats goes to Kelvin van der Linde, who in only his second race with BMW M Motorsport achieved maybe his biggest win yet together with his brother. The #46 crew also did an excellent job coming back in the race and finishing just ten seconds behind.\u201d\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): \u201cI am very, very happy! I think this victory was down to excellent execution of the guys at Team WRT. I don\u2019t think I have ever seen such a perfect execution in terms of strategy before. We did not have the outright fastest car today, but still we did it! Both my teammates didn\u2019t make any mistakes. Sharing this win with my brother for the first time since 2018, is very special of course. I\u2019m really impressed how quickly he is up there with his pace in just his second race with BMW M Motorsport.\u201d\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): \u201cThis was a race with a crazy amount of emotions for me. First race back with Team WRT, first race back with my brother, first race with Augusto, second race for BMW M Motorsport. This is all very special. I don\u2019t have to explain what this win means for my brother and myself. I\u2019m sure, mom and dad are proud at home. It\u2019s also amazing for me to share this victory with Augusto, whom I looked up to when I was a kid. He was one of my heroes. Looking at the race, the final stint was very tough, as I had to hit fuel numbers and had Chaz Mostert behind me catching up. But in the end, it worked out perfectly.\u201d\n\nAugusto Farfus (#32 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): \u201cI\u2019m a very lucky guy to be with BMW M Motorsport for such a long time. We came here many times and never were lucky enough to win. This time, we thought we had a chance \u2013 and we executed a perfect race. To put my name in the history books of this event now is very emotional. During the final 40 minutes we just hoped for a green end, as a safety car would have ruined our race. Luckily it all went well in the end. Thanks a lot to BMW M Motorsport, Team WRT and my teammates who did a perfect job.\u201d\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): \u201cThis podium is a fantastic way to start the season. The whole weekend was great, as we were always strong and competitive. We were able to fight with our sister car until I made a mistake unfortunately and we had to serve a drive-through penalty. I thought at that point that the fight for the podium was over. But we managed to come back with great pace. Raffaele\u2019s pass against Jules Gounon was a lot of fun to watch. I am very happy with the result.\u201d\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): \u201cA 1-2 is a great result for the team. I know they have tried to win it for a long time, and now it finally worked out. Not for me personally, so I will still have to wait for my first victory here after a couple of podium finishes. It was a good fight with Jules Gounon. I knew I had the faster car on the straights, and when there was a slower car in front of us, I took the opportunity and attacked him. It was a good move. \u201d\n\nCharles Weerts (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): \u201cHuge congrats to our sister car. They were really quick all week and really deserve this win. For BMW M Motorsport it has been a long time trying to win here, so this 1-2 is pretty big for them and also for the entire Team WRT. Their strategy was absolute masterclass today. The overall result is great, but next time I hope we can swap positions.\u201d",

Augusto Farfus in the black #32 machine has controlled the second third of the race and enjoys a 2s lead over Jayden Ojeda, who is fighting hard in the Craft Bamboo Mercedes. Despite not having the same pace as the opening stint, Chaz Mostert remains in contention in the #32 Arise Racing Ferrari in third.Ayhancan Guven (#911) and Jules Gounon (#75) complete the top five. But strategy is the name of the game with the contenders needing to do either three or four more stops to make it home with the #46 going on an alternate run in sixth. Critically contenders Maro Engel (#888) and Broc Feeney (#183) are out of action after separate incidents.Sam Shahin has a strong grip on Pro Am, as does Villagomez in Silver, while Josh Buchan is four laps up in GT4. Following a fourth Safety due to debris caused by a clash between Luke Youlden and Adrian Deitz, there was finally an extended green flag run that went for more than two hours all the way to half race distance. The long stretch was dominated by Team WRT with the two BMWs heading the field by using smart strategy and fuel saving. During this period Gounon had also pushed the SunEnergy1 Mercedes all the way into the top three, where Talbot had started his stint in the #183 Audi but slumped to ninth against more experienced drivers. Critically the #44 Audi of Scott Andrews returned to the track after losing The long run was broken at the halfway mark due to Christodoulou going off at Hell Corner .Following the restart Team WRT maintained control but there were multiple moments where lapped traffic saw its advantages vanish. At one stage the top six ran nose to tail, but eventually Farfus was able to break clear. Soon the intense pace proved to be too much for some of the top contenders. In more Bathurst heartbreak for Feeney, the #183 MPC Audi got stuck in the sand at The Chase.A part failure in the braking area sent Feller suddenly careering into the sand and out of action. After going from a lap down to running eighth during the seventh hour, it was tough to take. \u201cThis place keeps disappointing me, so I hope it\u2019s not too far until we have a good one,\u201d Feeney said. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure what happened yet, so hopefully we can get the car back and have a look. \u201cWe were really fast earlier in the day. \u201cWe were one of the only cars that could actually pass the Ferraris and Mercedes and all that. \u201cI thought if we were up there at the end we could fight for it today, but as always, Bathurst seems to have something up its sleeve for me.\u201d The #888 of Engel had dropped to the back of the five-way battle for the lead due to a pit lane penalty for leaving an earthing cable connected to the car as it left a pit stop during Hour 5. However, the Team GMR Mercedes race came to an end on Lap 170, just six laps after the Audi.Sitting Martin seventh got slightly too wide leaving the Chase which saw him spear across the track and crunch hard into the concrete on the exit of Turn 22. The impact was so severe the car went airborne and was wiped out on the spot. Despite having led the race more than any international driver, Engel\u2019s Bathurst 12 Hour drought continued for another year, but he was more worried about Martin. \u201cIt was a pretty big impact into the concrete wall and it looks like he was not feeling great so I hope he is okay and that is the main thing,\u201d Engel said. \u201cWe were in the top four and Maxi was doing a great job. Looks like he just dropped a wheel in the sand but these things happen,\u201d said co-driver Greiner. During the yellow the #46 of Weerts took an extra stop to go on an alternate strategy to leading teammate Farfus. Racing resumed with 4h34m left on the clock and Farfus immediately pulled the best part of 2s on Ojeda and Mostert.That remained the order after eight hours of racing in beautiful conditions. VAN DER LINDE STAYS IN CHARGE AS FERRARI AND PORSCHE BATTLE The ninth hour of the 2025 Meguiar\u2019s Bathurst 12 Hour stayed clean as Kelvin van der Linde ensured the #32 BMW maintains the lead, currently 3s over Maximilian Gotz in the Craft Bamboo Mercedes. They are well ahead of Alession Picariello and Will Brown, who are currently in an intense nose to tail fight for third on the road. With less than three hours remaining Robichon heads Bronze, Jaxon Evans leads Pro Am by the best part of two laps having passed the #91, Jaylyn Robotham leads Tony D\u2019Alberto in a tight fight for Silver, while Levitt is three laps ahead in GT4. Despite Farfus looking strong, the top four compressed at the start of the ninth hour with only 1.7s separating them as the approached the 200-lap mark. The next turning point was the lap 201 pit cycle where Mostert, Ojeda and Guven pitted nose to tail from second to fourth. The trio were all released at the same time which saw the #911 of Picariello jump Brown\u2019s Ferrari to slot in behind the Craft Bamboo Mercedes. Farfus boxed from the lead two laps later and kelvin van der Linde jumped in with 4s up his sleeve. Gounon and Weerts stayed out for another three laps to lap 206 and they retained track position. With Stolz fifth in the #75 and Rossi sixth in the #46 the top six were separated by 20s. The pair at close quarters were Picariello and Brown, who were running nose to tail in a thrilling fight for third with a particularly close call at Forrests Elbow. Brown kept chasing hard for the remainder of the hour and sensed his moment at the arrival of the lapped #19. He got a run down Conrod Straight and had a look at both The Chase and Murrays, but could not get close enough. The Ferrari managed to even get some overlap when they arrived at Griffins Bend, but Picariello held firm on the inside yet again. However, their scuffles saw them drift more than 15s away from leader Kelvin van der Linde, who retains a soldi 3s advantage. Just three hours remain with the finish creeping every closer. Bathurst Hour 10: BMW GROWS LEAD AS FIGHT FOR THIRD INTENSIFIES With just two hours remaining, BMW remains in the box seat at the Meguiar\u2019s Bathurst 12 Hour, but plenty remain in contention. Just 23s cover the top five after 10 hours and 248 laps of racing around Mount Panorama. The van der Linde brothers of Kelvin and currently Sheldon maintained the #32 Team WRT BMW\u2019s lead that currently sits at 4s. Their nearest rival remains the Craft Bamboo Mercedes currently steered by pole sitter Lucas Auer with just 4s between them. Around 17s further back is a heated battle pack of Daniel Serra in the #26 Ferrari, Luca Stolz in the SunEnergy Mercedes and Ayhancan Guven in the #911 Porsche. Maintaining the Pro Am lead is Rovera in the sister Ferrari with Bronze controlled by Fiore and GT4 Santalucia. There was a change in Sliver class with D\u2019Alberto catching and passing Robotham\u2019s Aston Martin at the start of the 10th hour. However, there was more at play with Volante Rosso Motorsport pulling the Gulf backed machine into the garage. Brown had been right under the wing of Picariello for over an hour and just when the Porsche appeared to break free from the Ferrari, things turned upside down thanks to one mistake. Picariello bowled a wide at Murrays Corner, carrying too much entry speed and found the gravel. Although he escaped swiftly, the damage was done with Brown snatching third place and going 3s up the road. This released the pressure and tension at the front of the field as they charge towards the final two hours. They returned to the pits together on Lap 233 and things remained the same with Serra leading Guven by 3s. Gotz managed to keep up with van der Linde and squeezed an extra lap out of the stint. Leader Van der Linde boxed with 2h21m to go and retained a 2s lead over Auer, while Rossi came to complete his third 12 Hour five minutes later. The MotoGP legend unfortunately made the mistake of hitting the wall on pit entry, just before the limit line. However, Stolz found even more range in his tank, going all the way until Lap 241, ensuring he returned third and perform the overcut on Serra and Guven. However, the factory Ferrari river had the lights on and used the 296\u2019s straight line speed to snare third place back with a committed move at The Chase. As they wrestled for third, 20s up the road Sheldon van der Linde was importantly growing his lead over Auer. After it started at 2s, it doubled to 4s by the end of the hour which could be decisive if it stays green. BATHURST HOUR 11: BMW IN BOX SEAT Team WRT is the team to take the 2025 Meguiar\u2019s Bathurst 12 Hour with Kelvin van der Linde enjoying a solid advantage into the final hour. Van der Linde in the #32 BMW has controlled the second half of the race an enters the 12th and final hour with a 6s lead over Chaz Mostert. However, Mostert is predicted to make another stop before the chequered flag with Lucas Auer in the Craft Bamboo Mercedes the nearest who does not need another top up a further 8s back. Jules Gounon is back for another hero stint but has work to do in the SunEnergy machine, being 19s off the pace, while Raffaele Marciello in the #46 is keeping Matt Campbell out of the top five. Although BMW is in the box seat, things can easily shake up in the final hour. Heading Pro Am is Alessio Rovera in the #36, Silver is fronted by Brendon Leitch, while GT4 is headed by Josh Buchan. Kelvin Van der Linde was setting a hot pace up the front of the field, growing their advantage to 7s as the race entered the penultimate hour. Fiore was around 20s adrift of Bronze leader Gunn at the start of the 11th hour, but their battle would not go any further as the #9 Audi headed into the garage. GT4 Mercedes of Christodoulou also suffered the same fate. With the race closing down the contenders were most worried about fuel strategy and maintaining track position. The Team WRT BMWs were in the best position, being predicted to make it home with just one more stop, while the rest may struggle to do the same. Serra had the foot down and was going hard, reducing the deficit to van der Linde to 19s before stopping on Lap 265 with 1h24m to go. Both the #26 Ferrari and #911 Porsche carried on their battle, pitting together to put Mostert and Campbell in with the hope of a late Safety Car. A slow getaway for the Porsche star gave away 9s to his Arise Racing rival. Next to need fuel was second placed Auer, who pitted three laps later for tyres and fuel. The Craft Bamboo Mercedes came out 5s clear of Mostert, but in an awkward position in regards to file saving over the final 76 minutes. As a result, Mostert only needed three laps to fly by down Conrod. Having built an 18s advantage, leader van der Linde waited until Lap 273 to make the final fuel stop and change over to brother Kelvin. Despite coming out third on the road, those ahead had to still pit and with nearest rival Auer 15s back, this left him with a 66m stint from glory. Those ahead of Stolz and Marciello pitted line astern just one lap later, the positions rained the same with Gounon jumping into the SunEnergy machine for the run home. 2025 Meguiar\u2019s Bathurst 12 Hour results Pos Drivers Class Car Laps Time 1 A.Farfus/S.van der Linde/K.van der Linde PRO BMW 306 12:01:53.1350 +3 2 V.Rossi/C.Weerts/R.Marciello PRO BMW 306 +10.245 +10 3 K.Habul/J.Gounon/L.Stolz PRO Mercedes 306 +11.363 +5 4 C.Mostert/W.Brown/D.Serra PRO Ferrari 306 +1:03.9620 +1 5 M.Gotz/L.Auer/J.Ojeda PRO Mercedes 306 +1:27.9040 -4 6 A.Picariello/A.Guven/M.Campbell PRO Porsche 306 +1:42.0680 +7 7 R.Gunn/Z.Robichon/I.James BRO Mercedes 305 +1 Lap +6 8 J.Evans/E.Schutte/B.Schumacher/A.Rovera PAM Ferrari 303 +2 Laps +8 9 T.D\u2019Alberto/B.Leitch/G.Denyer/A.Deitz SIL Lamborghini 303 +2 Laps +6 10 L.Heinrich/Y.Shahin/S.Shahin/M.Schuring PAM Porsche 303 +2 Laps -5 11 L.Holdsworth/D.Fiore/M.Cini BRO Audi 291 +15 Laps -1 12 L.Youlden/D.Russell/T.Koundouris/J.Koundouris SIL Mercedes 283 +23 Laps +3 13 J.Day/M.Villagomez/J.Robotham SIL Aston Martin 276 +30 Laps +5 14 A.Levitt/J.Buchan/J.Santalucia GT4 McLaren 276 +30 Laps +8 15 D.Crampton/T.Harrison/G.Wood INV KTM 270 +36 Laps +4 16 M.Griffith/A.Christodoulou/D.Bilski GT4 Mercedes 261 +45 Laps +4 17 S.Andrews/M.Zalloua/S.Pires PAM Audi 241 +65 Laps -9 18 M.Engel/M.Martin/M.Grenier PRO Mercedes 170 +136 Laps -15 19 R.Feller/B.Feeney/L.Talbot PRO Audi 164 +142 laps -17 20 F.Schiller/B.Grove/S.Grove BRO Mercedes 53 +253 -6 21 R.Sorensen/T.Hayman/Buccini GT4 McLaren 36 +270 Laps \u2013 22 C.Lowndes/T.Randle/C.

            "content": "I managed to keep the January blues at bay this year until I got my tax bill, which forced me to look at the shelves and start thinking about which copper-bottomed box set might have to go. Discogs is now an exercise in window shopping. In terms of new releases I shelled out for very little, and even resisted picking anything up in the juicily stocked bins at the new World Of Echo when I popped my head in \u2013 OG Dead C, a Fahey I needed, the Terry Reed mentioned below. These limitations did not extend to the Throbbing Gristle Berlin box set, (there are a few copies left on Bandcamp, but it\u2019s sold out direct from Mute), and which was worth every penny I don\u2019t have. The sound is huge and clean and heavy; some of Genesis\u2019 vocals have a profound disquiet in their guttural delivery, and the impossible tension lashes the group together with a fizzing, demonic intensity.\n\nI saw an amazing show by Koshiro Hino and Will Guthrie, where they succeeded at doing one of the toughest things: to bring electronic and acoustic percussions together. It synced in this wonderfully wavy way, with Hino riding the rhythms from Guthrie, who seemed to be driving into jazz modes as a way to transcend the grid. I also saw Tr\u00e4d, Gr\u00e4s Och Stenar for the fourth time in my life. They were one of the first groups I saw where, when I was just a teenager, I discovered that with certain music, you could actually talk to the band at the merch stand.\n\nI pulled books from shelves I hadn\u2019t got round to reading instead of buying new ones. I read the republished In Thrall by Jane DeLynn and am looking for someone to talk to about its teenage protagonist (is her agency compromised or does it remain intact?). A good book but a bad choice for a sad month was K\u014db\u014d Abe\u2019s The Woman In The Dunes, a stressful story that chafes (and not just because of all the sand). I also found a hardback copy of Neuromancer and may reread it, which I\u2019m convinced has some of the most heinous and/or odd covers of any book, ever. I chose not to read much news; have dropped Twitter; stopped listening to any current affairs podcasts. Sometimes it is necessary to step out of the slipstream and regroup, to wait until the sky is no longer low and jaundiced with dirty rain clouds; when the wind no longer bites at your cheeks; when the first bulbs begin to show and the memory of a hefty tax bill has faded, with the influx of a few month\u2019s wages.\n\nBruit Direct Disques Tori Kudo Studio Village Hototoguiss 2007-2022 Tori Kudo \u2013 Studio Village Hototoguiss 2007-2022 by Tori Kudo I have rarely listened to anything as much as I have listened to this Tori Kudo (except for a six month period when the only CD in the car was Iggy Pop\u2019s The Idiot). If you followed Kudo on his now defunct Soundcloud account (I didn\u2019t) you might remember some of this material, which is where it originated. It was also released on some limited cassettes I also missed, so this was all new to me. Lashed-together-sentimental-songs Tori Kudo is my favourite Tori Kudo, and they\u2019re here in numbers across two LPs\u2019 worth of material, along with other miniatures. Some of them \u2013 \u2018Lickin Up The Dust\u2019 in particular \u2013 have stolen my heart as January earworms. Revealing the final track feels like I ought to issue a spoiler alert, it is such an absolutely ideal outro, closing with a sweet, short cover of the second movement of Beethoven\u2019s seventh (if you\u2019re wondering if you know this, it\u2019s the classical motif in Zardoz).\n\nVHF Liam Grant Prodigal Son Prodigal Son by Liam Grant Opening with a raw rolling blues number called \u2018Palmyra\u2019, this Liam Grant album on long running label VHF is my second favourite record of the month, and the first thing I\u2019ve really dug in on by this relatively young guitarist. Everybody seems to mention his age in write ups and features (he\u2019s in his mid-20s), perhaps because the ground he\u2019s treading has more often been the fancy of older souls. His trajectory is through an obsession with the Joe Bussard/ Fahey/ 78rpm country and bluegrass zone, later filtered and infused with the broad influences of DIY and underground culture. Recording is rough and often distorted or in the red, and this grit sits well. On \u2018Salmon Tails Up The River\u2019 his fingers are fluid and glittering over the strings, \u2018Insult To Injury\u2019 drops into a gentle lyricism; \u2018A Moment At The Door\u2019 is sparse and pensive and \u2018Old Country Rock\u2019, is of a moonshine-on-the-old-back-porch vintage.\n\nIdeologic Organ Nina Garcia Bye Bye Bird Bye Bye Bird by Nina Garcia More guitars now, on a record I\u2019m predicting will get picked up quite widely (it\u2019s on Stephen O\u2019Malley\u2019s Ideologic Organ label, with an approving write up from Thurston Moore in the notes). I\u2019d never heard of Parisian guitarist Nina Garcia before, perhaps because it\u2019s the first under her own name (previously she performed as Mariachi and has a couple of cassettes under that moniker). An old bio on Discogs translates to \u201cGuitar, pedals: that\u2019s it\u201d. Lots of these pieces have the immediacy of sketches \u2013 she mulls on a particular sound and what might come from its repetition. Some tracks become insistent and relentless, others have a pace that stops time, even when the sounds are harsh or swarming. The quiet breaths of \u2018Ballade Des Souffles\u2019 is an exception. There\u2019s a simplicity to the processes and patterns, with timbres that feel more affiliated with sheet metals than strings, as if the root input was not a guitar but Harry Bertoia\u2019s sound sculptures. She\u2019s touring this album pretty extensively across the UK and Europe from now-ish through to the end of April.\n\nBuh Oksana Linde Traves\u00edas Traves\u00edas by Oksana Linde I\u2019ve recently been listening to a lot of old private press loner synth stuff from that brief period when synths became affordable and portable enough to have in your spare room and people ran off their own cassettes from home \u2013 people like George Garside and Rick Crane (hat tip on this to Nate Young\u2019s Baker\u2019s Dozen). This is the second release on Buh for Venezuelan composer Oksana Linde and it fits right in that mould. Her previous release didn\u2019t stick with me, and right now I\u2019m not sure why \u2013 I wonder if I found it a touch light in a new age-y way \u2013 but this one has landed with me solidly and is on repeat. It has that same sense of world-building-for-one that I find in Garside and Crane, where the music feels less about the spiritual introspection or functional music that drives DIY new age synth work, and instead conjures imaginative spaces: science fiction narratives or cosmic dramas, unfolding in questing synthetic choruses.\n\nShelter Press Judith Hamann Aune Aunes by Judith Hamann Hamann has studied with and performed work by Charles Curtis and \u00c9liane Radigue (they have their own OCCAM \u2013 River XXIV work for alto flute and cello from 2019), along with a clutch of other composers. This, the latest in a handful of solo releases, is named and framed around an aune \u2013 a measurement of cloth which is not only about length or weight, and which differs from place to place. It is, apparently, known as an ell in the UK, for any fabric heads out there. This measurement frames the record, as a way of describing the sense which governs structure and significance within the compositions \u2013 I take it perhaps as an attempt to weigh a song and its contents, when there is no objective gold standard by which to do so. This is subtle work, its slow folds constructed from cello, voice, and location recordings \u2013 elements that are regularly combined elsewhere, but here serve to loosen the division of the senses: a way of looking and a way of listening. Probably because of the title, I kept thinking of fabric and light \u2013 an image of a woman in a fabric shop pulling lengths of ivory cotton from a roll; of casting a clean sheet over a bed in morning light; of gauzy curtains and an open window.\n\nSiltbreeze Terry Reed On Way To Alpha Terry Reed-On Way To Alpha mini lp by Siltbreeze Records Speaking of the spaceways\u2026 I dropped onto the Siltbreeze site to pick up a Jim Shepard they\u2019ve recently reissued and ended up On Way To Alpha, courtesy of this Terry Reed mini LP. Its title track is an undeniable tune and a half, and I especially love the Robert Plant vocal leaps. It took me a while to move past it, I just kept hitting rewind, but then realised the second track \u2018Into The Dream Block\u2019, and third \u2018The Year \u201983\u2019 could be jammed together into a single extended piece with breakdown and resolution, and in fact they are all On Way To Alpha. It\u2019s only the oddly furious minute-long outro \u2018Angry Eyes\u2019 that feels out of step. Nobody seems to know much about Reed except that he recorded this and released it on 7\u2033 around 1975. It feels like something that could have been discovered lurking in a Paul Major Sound Effects catalogue, or in Patrick Lundborg\u2019s Acid Archives. I checked the latter, and found no sign of it.\n\nAOB\n\nAOB is a late pickup of an album by Ignatz & Marcia Bassett, called Dream Of Autumn Electrified Blues I & II.\n\nOne of my first writing gigs was for a long-defunct Manchester blog, covering vaguely experimental, mostly electronica releases, which is the first place I think I ever came across Ignatz, aka Belgian musician Bram Devens. This felt like a welcome blast from the past, from a specific period in underground music, pre-Discogs, when I was always trying to escape indie sleaze quicksand and had zero contacts to ask about who would sell me DIY CD-Rs. At that time I received a comp which I grew to love dearly, because it signalled a way towards the CD-Rs I dearly desired, collecting Ignatz\u2019s cassette work. Cut to the chase, this all means I was glad to receive this collaboration from Ignatz and Marcia Bassett, and was surprised to learn it was the first time these two stalwarts have played together. Pitching itself as a psychedelic blues soundscape, it\u2019s gauzy and foggy, with shifting mists of mussed feedback and liberally applied delay. \u2018Part Two\u2019 is the one, its pitches wibbling and bending like light refracted through a prism.",

While most competitors had to refuel just before the end of the race, the two WRT BMW M4 GT3s were able to continue without stopping. With five hours to go, the #46 car temporarily dropped from second to eighth place due to a drive-through penalty from the Tavullia man for a safety car violation, but fought hard to get back on the podium.\n\nIt was an impressive one-two finish for the BMW M4 GT3s at the Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC) season opener. Brothers Sheldon and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) triumphed alongside Augusto Farfus (BRA) in the No. 32 car.\n\nValentino Rossi (ITA), Raffaele Marciello (SUI) and Charles Weerts (BEL) in the #4 BMW M3 GT46 took second place, 10 seconds from victory, with a one-second gap to third thanks to a spectacular overtake by Raffaele Marciello on Jules Gounon (AND, Mercedes).\n\nAndreas roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \u201cCongratulations to Team WRT on the long-awaited victory at Bathurst! This was our third attempt with the BMW M4 GT3, and after coming close to victory last year, we finally made it! I am very happy for the Van der Linde brothers who can celebrate a victory in their first race behind the wheel of a BMW M Motorsport car. I am also happy for Augusto Farfus, who can add another prestigious triumph to his illustrious career as a BMW M Works driver. Valentino Rossi, Raffaele Marciello and Charles Weerts also did a great job in the sister car. It was a shame that a penalty denied them a chance of victory. Team WRT remains unbeaten this year after victories in the Dubai 24 Hours and the Abu Dhabi 6 Hours. Let\u2019s hope this bodes well for the rest of the season! Thanks to all the drivers, team members and BMW M Motorsport employees who made this exceptional start to the season possible.\u201d\n\nVincent Vosse, Team Principal Team WRT: \u201cThree races, three wins. What a great start to the season! We\u2019ve tried to win at Bathurst with BMW M Motorsport for the last two years but it never worked out. This time it was perfect. It\u2019s an important race that everyone wants to win, so I couldn\u2019t be happier. I want to give a special shout out to Kelvin van der Linde, who in only his second race with BMW M Motorsport, took perhaps his biggest win with his brother. The #46 crew also did a great job in coming back into the race and finishing just ten seconds behind.\u201d\n\nValentino Rossi (BMW M4 GT3 #46, 2nd place): \u201cThis podium is a fantastic way to start the season. The whole weekend was great because we were always strong and competitive. We were able to fight with the sister car until I made a mistake and we had to serve a penalty. I thought the fight for the podium was over then. But we managed to come back with good pace. Raffaele\u2019s overtaking of Jules Gounon was great fun to watch. I am very happy with this result.\u201d\n\nValentino Rossi Australia\n\nValentino Rossi Australia",

It was a race of saving fuel and [hitting] numbers, basically.\n\n\u201cThe last stint was pretty tricky having a number in my ear. Otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have made it to the finish.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how much fuel he thinks he had left after the checkered flag, Kelvin said: \u201cI had a fuel surge on the way to the podium ceremony so it was very close.\u201d\n\nKelvin and Sheldon became only the second pair of brothers to have won overall at Mount Panorama, joining David and Geoff Brabham, who won the 1997 Bathurst 1000 Super Touring race, also in a BMW.\n\n\u201cThis race particularly just had an absolute crazy amount of emotions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my first race back with WRT, my second one with BMW, first one back with Sheldon and first one with Augusto.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely special and I\u2019m sure my mom and dad are really, really proud.\u201d\n\nYounger brother Sheldon said he was impressed with how quickly Kelvin came to grips with the M4 GT3, in only his second race with the car after last month\u2019s Rolex 24 at Daytona.\n\n\u201cI have to say I\u2019m very impressed with his start at BMW in only his second race out and he\u2019s already on pace. It\u2019s really, really impressive to see,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou saw that in the last stint. He had to save fuel and keep Chaz [Mostert] behind him, which wasn\u2019t really our race in the end so we decided to let him go.\n\n\u201cIt was really, really impressive to see both guys making no mistakes, the team, the execution was key to the win today. I think that really was key to success.\n\n\u201cI think the pace wasn\u2019t really there to win the race outright compared to other cars but I\u2019m very, very happy.\u201d\n\nBoth BMWs, along with the 75 Express-run Mercedes-AMG, were banking on the long green flag stretch to the checkered flag, as a late-race full-course caution would have gone in favor of the No. 26 Arise Racing GT Ferrari 296 GT3 of Chaz Mostert, who finished fourth.\n\n\u201cThe last 40 minutes of the race was difficult for ourselves because a safety car would have ruined our race,\u201d added Farfus.\n\n\u201cKelvin and Sheldon did a really good job. I think we showed during the race that we executed well as a team.\u201d\n\nSunEnergy1 Racing\u2019s Jules Gounon added: \u201cThis year, it was really a fuel race. It was quite difficult because you don\u2019t want to lose pace to the front but at the same time you have to meet your fuel numbers.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult race. I don\u2019t think we really had the pace to hit the front. So we\u2019re super happy to be P3.\u201d",

            "content": "Bathurst. What a race, what a victory! Team WRT achieved an impressive 1-2 result with the BMW M4 GT3 at the Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS), the season opener of the Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC). Brothers Sheldon and Kelvin van der Linde (both RSA) triumphed alongside Augusto Farfus (BRA) in car #32. Following them, Valentino Rossi (ITA), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Charles Weerts (BEL) in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 secured second place. It was the first victory for BMW M Motorsport in the GT3 era at the Mount Panorama Circuit. Team WRT remains undefeated in the 2025 season after successes at the 24h Dubai and the 6h Abu Dhabi (both UAE). On the sidelines of the race at Bathurst, the new BMW M3 CS Touring (fuel consumption combined: 10.5 l/100 km [26.9 mpg imp]; CO 2 emissions combined: 238 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO 2 class: G)* celebrated its world premiere .\n\nTeam WRT owed its 1-2 finish primarily to a perfect race strategy. Throughout the race, the two BMW M4 GT3s consistently gained an advantage in fuel consumption, which ultimately decided victory or defeat. While most competitors had to pit for refuelling just before the end, both BMW M4 GT3s were able to continue without stopping. Car #46 temporarily fell back to eighth place due to a drive-through penalty but fought its way back onto the podium. Marciello secured second place with a spectacular overtaking manoeuvre against Jules Gounon (AND, Mercedes).\n\nBMW M Motorsport won at Bathurst for the first time after numerous attempts since GT3 cars have been competing there. The last triumph dates back to 2010 with a BMW 335i. For the Van der Linde brothers, it was their first joint victory in a BMW M Motorsport car, and for Rossi, it was his first podium at the Bathurst 12 Hour.\n\nWorld premiere of the new BMW M3 CS Touring.\n\nBorn on the racetrack, made for the street: BMW M\u2019s philosophy came to life on Thursday ahead of the Bathurst 12 Hour. In the Mount Panorama Circuit pit lane, the first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring celebrated its world premiere, presented by Sylvia Neubauer, Vice President Customer, Brand, and Sales at BMW M GmbH. The iconic racetrack provided the perfect stage for the debut of the latest BMW M special-edition model in the high-performance sports car sector. A 405 kW/550 hp six-cylinder in-line engine, bespoke chassis tuning, exclusive design features and weight savings resulting from the use of numerous carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) components provide the ingredients for an unadulterated racing-car feel.\n\nReactions after the Bathurst 12 Hour:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \u201cCongratulations to Team WRT on the long-awaited Bathurst victory! It was our third attempt with the BMW M4 GT3, and after coming close last year, we finally made it! I am very happy for the Van der Linde brothers that they can celebrate a victory in their first race sharing a car for BMW M Motorsport. I am also pleased for Augusto Farfus, who can add another prestigious triumph to his illustrious career as a BMW M works driver. Valentino Rossi, Raffaele Marciello, and Charles Weerts also did a great job in the sister car. It's a pity that a penalty cost them a chance of victory. Team WRT remains undefeated this year after victories at the 24h Dubai and the 6h Abu Dhabi. Hopefully, this is a good omen for the rest of the season! Thank you to all the drivers, team members, and BMW M Motorsport employees who made this outstanding season start possible.\u201d\n\nVincent Vosse, Team Principal Team WRT: \u201cThree races, three wins. What an amazing start of the season! We tried to win at Bathurst with BMW M Motorsport for the last two years, but it never worked out. This time, everything was just spot on. This is a big race everyone wants to win, so I could not be happier. A special congrats goes to Kelvin van der Linde, who in only his second race with BMW M Motorsport achieved maybe his biggest win yet together with his brother. The #46 crew also did an excellent job coming back in the race and finishing just ten seconds behind.\u201d\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): \u201cI am very, very happy! I think this victory was down to excellent execution of the guys at Team WRT. I don\u2019t think I have ever seen such a perfet execution in terms of strategy before. We did not have the outright fastest car today, but still we did it! Both my teammates didn\u2019t make any mistakes. Sharing this win with my brother for the first time since 2018, is very special of course. I\u2019m really impressed how quickly he is up there with his pace in just his second race with BMW M Motorsport.\u201d\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): \u201cThis was a race with a crazy amount of emotions for me. First race back with Team WRT, first race back with my brother, first race with Augusto, second race for BMW m Motorsport. This is all very special. I don\u2019t have to explain, what this win means for my brother and myself. I\u2019m sure, mom and dad are proud at home. It\u2019s also amazing for me to share this victory with Augusto, whom I looked up to when I was a kid. He was one of my heroes. Looking at the race, the final stint was very tough, as I had to hit fuel numbers and had Chaz Mostert behind me catching up. But in the end, it worked out perfectly.\u201d\n\nAugusto Farfus (#32 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): \u201cI\u2019m a very lucky guy to be with BMW M Motorsport for such a long time. We came here many times and never were lucky enough to win. This time, we thought we had a chance \u2013 and we executed a perfect race. To put my name in the history books of this event now is very emotional. During the final 40 minutes we just hoped for a green end, as a safety car would have ruined our race. Luckily it all went well in the end. Thanks a lot to BMW M Motorsport, Team WRT and my teammates who did a perfect job.\u201d\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): \u201cThis podium is a fantastic way to start the season. The whole weekend was great, as we were always strong and competitive. We were able to fight with our sister car until I made a mistake unfortunately and we had to serve a drive-through penalty. I tought at that point, that the fight for the podium was over. But we managed to come back with great pace. Raffaele\u2019s pass against Jules Gounon was a lot of fun to watch. I am very happy with the result.\u201d\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): \u201cA 1-2 is a great result for the team. I know they have tried to win it for a long time, and now it finally worked out. Not for me personally, so I will still have to wait for my first victory here after a couple of podium finishes. It was a good fight with Jules Gounon. I knew I had the faster car on the straights, and when there was a slower car in front of us, I took the opportunity and attacked him. It was a good move. \u201d\n\nCharles Weerts (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): \u201cHuge congrats to our sister car. They were really quick all week and really deserve this win. For BMW M Motorsport it has been a long time trying to win here, so this 1-2 is pretty big for them and also for the entire Team WRT. Their strategy was absolute masterclass today. The overall result is great, but next time I hope we can swap positions.\u201d\n\n* Official figures on fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions were determined based on the prescribed WLTP measurement procedure and are in accordance with Pkw-EnVKV.

Goetz, ultimately, held sway.\n\nIn the cool morning conditions, Chaz Mostert (#26 Arise Ferrari) made headway early from fifth on the grid to take the lead on the seventh lap.\n\nContact with the wall for the #14 Aston Martin with Jamie Day behind the wheel \ud83d\ude2c#B12Hr pic.twitter.com/tFnOKQXIOd \u2014 Bathurst 12 Hour (@Bathurst12hour) February 1, 2025\n\nJamie Day (#14 Gulf Aston-Martin) threatened to cause the first caution when he slapped the wall under the tree as he crested The Mountain. He escaped unscathed but that car befell a clutch issue while leading the Silver class.\n\nDuring the first round of pit stops, Gotz found himself buried in the gravel at Murray\u2019s Corner after he came across the nose of the #26 Arise Ferrari, then driven by Will Brown. No penalty was issued and both cars were undamaged.\n\nDRAMA AT MURRAY\u2019S CORNER! The first BMW Safety Car of the race has been called.#B12Hr pic.twitter.com/qsGXx8m0Pg \u2014 Bathurst 12 Hour (@Bathurst12hour) February 1, 2025\n\nAn hour and a half into the race, Craig Lowndes (#888 Scott Taylor Motorsport Mercedes) crashed on approach to the Dipper. He damaged the left rear beyond repair and that brought an early end to his campaign with Thomas Randle and Cameron Waters.\n\nThe carnage continued shortly thereafter when the #24 Method Motorsport McLaren Artura lost control at McPhillamy Park. Ryan Sorensen veered across the track and into the wall before ricocheting back into the path of Pro-Am contender Marcel Zalloua (#44 Valmont Audi).\n\nWith nowhere to go, Zalloua got sandwiched up against the concrete wall entering Brock\u2019s Skyline and suffered significant damage. Nevertheless, the car was brought back to pit lane and repaired. It lost laps hand over fist but finished the contest.\n\nThe biggest crash of the day came when Kenny Habul (#75 75 Express Mercedes) side-swiped Stephen Grove (#4 Grove Mercedes). The contact sent Grove hard into the wall at Brock\u2019s Skyline, destroying his car. Grove was taken to hospital.\n\nAt the quarter-distance mark, it was the #911 Absolute Racing Porsche that led the way with Ayhancan Guven, Matt Campbell, and Alessio Picariello.\n\nPorsche\u2019s ascendency effectively stopped there. BMW came to the fore with the #32 Team WRT car making headway.\n\nAfter a lean period of drama in the middle of the race, Broc Feeney\u2019s hopes of a surprise win ended when his Audi cried no more. Ricardo Feller was driving when broke began to billow from the front under brakes at The Chase, where he parked in the gravel trap.\n\nWith a little under five hours to go. The #888 Team GMR Mercedes crashed with Maxime Martin at the wheel. Out of The Chase, he got loose and suffered a tank-slapper, which sent him into the outside wall. Damage to the car was too significant to continue and the race ended there.\n\nAs the race continued, it became abundantly clear the win would be fought between BMW, Ferrari, and Mercedes \u2013 but one thing remained the same, the #32 largely controlled proceedings.\n\nWhat Mostert hoped would be his final pit stop of the race put him in a precarious position on fuel. In the end, he had to pit for a splash-and-dash after shooting to the lead.\n\nOn the stroke of 23 minutes to go, Mostert made his way to the lane and surrendered the lead. He fell to sixth and lost the best part of half a lap.\n\nMoments after that, Rafaelle Marciello (#46 Team WRT M4) blew by Jules Gounon (#75 Mercedes-AMG) for third, dropping the left side of his car onto the grass.\n\nThat became second for Marciello when Lucas Auer in the Craft-Bamboo Mercedes pitted for fuel. Auer, Gotz, and Jayden Ojeda finished fifth.\n\nIn the end, van der Linde was untouchable. He cleared out to a 10-second lead to claim a landmark win for BMW.\n\nRESULT: 2025 Meguiar\u2019s Bathurst 12 Hour",

            "content": "BMW has won the 2025 Bathurst 12 Hour, with the WRT BMW M4 GT3 of Kelvin van der Linde, Sheldon van der Linde and Augusto Farfus taking its maiden win in the race's GT3 era and leading a 1-2 finish.\n\nTwo of the changes in the race regulations since 2024 proved to be crucial and went some way in determining the winner of the race, held in hot and dry conditions at the 3.86-mile/6.213km Mount Panorama circuit.\n\nIn previous years drivers had been limited to stints of no more than 32 laps before refuelling, and had to serve a minimum number of stops. But those windows were wide open this year and BMW made the best use of the changes, and that made the difference.\n\nSheldon van der Linde handed the car over to his brother Kelvin with just over an hour of the race remaining, with a charging Chaz Mostert-driven Ferrari close behind him. But everyone at WRT \u2013 and Mostert \u2013 knew that the Italian car would need a lot of Safety Car laps to make the finish without another pitstop. Even after Mostert took the lead at The Chase with 37 minutes of the race remaining, no Safety Cars appeared in the final half-hour and that sealed the deal for the Belgian team.\n\nMostert pitted from the lead with 22 minutes of the race to run, resumed in sixth and moved up places when Matt Campbell and Lucas Auer, who were also out of their final fuel windows, pitted late in the race.\n\nIn the other BMW, Raffaele Marciello was on a charge, steaming around the outside of Jules Gounun' Mercedes-AMG at The Chase to take third, and then chased after the other car to make the best of its fuel, the Craft-Bamboo Mercedes-AMG GT3 of Auer. But the Mercedes also fell foul of its fuel window, pitting with six minutes left on the clock and promoting the second BMW of Marciello/Valentino Rossi/Charles Weerts to second.\n\n#46 BMW M4 GT3, Team WRT: Valentino Rossi, Charles Weerts, Raffaele Marciello (Photo by: SRO)\n\n\u201cIt was the hardest two hours of my life,\u201d said Kelvin after a 10.25s victory.\n\n\u201cWe were fuel-saving, especially when Chaz was coming, and it was so hard. We are very proud.\u201d\n\nFarfus added: \u201cWe have been so close, so far and we wound up having a fast car and we executed a perfect race.\u201d\n\nSheldon echoed his brother\u2019s words: \u201cI have to say it is brilliant, I think we were flawless from the get-go this morning. I have no words. We have been trying to win this race for three years!\u201d\n\nThe BMW result was not without some good fortune. Rossi drove swiftly, but was spotted passing a slower GT4 entry under yellow flags. Straight afterwards, while Weerts was completing the consequent drive-through penalty, another Safety Car period for a separate incident allowed him to minimise the loss of track position and stay with the leaders, even if it dropped the car from second to eighth at the time.\n\nWhat the race came down to was the six leading cars: both BMWs; the 75 Express Mercedes-AMG GT3 Evo of Gounon, Luca Stolz and Kenny Habul; Mostert, Will Brown and Daniel Serra in the Arise Racing Ferrari 296 GT3; the Craft-Bamboo Mercedes-AMG GT3 of Auer, Maxi Gotz and Jayden Ojeda and the Absolute Racing Porsche 911 GT3 R of defending winners Campbell and Ayhancan Guven, and Alessio Picariello. They finished in that order.\n\nThe best of the non-Pro entries in seventh outright turned out to be the Heart of Racing Mercedes-AMG of Ross Gunn, Ian James and Zach Robichon, which took out the Bronze class.\n\nThe Pro Am class winner was the second Arise Ferrari, driven by Jaxon Evans, Alessio Rovera, Brad Schumacher and Elliot Schutte, which got the better of the Manthey EMA Porsche. In the opening half of the race, the Porsche\u2019s Pro drivers Laurin Heinrich and Morris Schuring were right among the Pro entries but the car lost pace during the stints of Bronze drivers Sam and Yasser Shahin.\n\nIn the Silver class and ninth outright was the #93 Wall Racing Lamborghini Brendon Leitch, Tony D\u2019Alberto, Adrian Dietz and Australian television personality Grant Denyer.\n\nThe Adam Christodolou/Daniel Bilksi/Mark Griffith McLaren was the sole finisher in the GT4 class. The David Crampton/Trent Harrison/Glen Wood KTM X-bow took out the Invitational Class, in spite of the sole entrant in the class losing 20-plus laps while crash damage was repaired.\n\nCla N\u00ba Driver Car / Engine Laps Time 1 32 Augusto Farfus\n\nS.van der Linde\n\nK.van der Linde BMW 306 12:01'53.1350 2 46 Valentino Rossi\n\nCharles Weerts\n\nR.Marciello BMW 306 12:02'03.3800 3 75 Kenny Habul\n\nJules Gounon\n\nLuca Stolz Mercedes 306 12:02'04.4980 4 26 Chaz Mostert\n\nWilliam Brown\n\nDaniel Serra Ferrari 306 12:02'57.0970 5 77 Maximilian G\u00f6tz\n\nLucas Auer\n\nJayden Ojeda Mercedes 306 12:03'21.0390 6 911 A.Picariello\n\nAyhancan Guven\n\nMatt Campbell Porsche 306 12:03'35.2030 7 27 Ross Gunn\n\nZ.Robichon\n\nIan James Mercedes 305 12:03'38.3790 8 36 Jaxon Evans\n\nAlessio Rovera\n\nBrad Schumacher\n\nElliott Schutte Ferrari 303 12:01'53.7460 9 93 Tony D'Alberto\n\nAdrian Deitz\n\nGrant Denyer\n\nBrendon Leitch Lamborghini 303 12:03'15.8760 10 91 Laurin Heinrich\n\nMorris Schuring\n\nSam Shahin\n\nYasser Shahin Porsche 303 12:03'18.3430 11 9 Marc Cini\n\nDean Fiore\n\nLee Holdsworth Audi 291 12:02'58.6860 12 47 James Koundouris\n\nTheo Koundouris\n\nDavid Russell\n\nLuke Youlden Mercedes 283 12:02'23.8930 13 14 Jamie Day\n\nJaylyn Robotham\n\nMateo Villagomez Aston Martin 276 12:02'37.4330 14 24 Josh Buchan\n\nJake Santalucia\n\nAnthony Levitt McLaren 276 12:06'20.5270 15 50 David Crampton\n\nTrent Harrison\n\nGlen Wood KTM 270 12:02'28.1630 16 19 Daniel Bilski\n\nA.Christodoulou\n\nMark Griffith Mercedes 261 12:03'51.9930 17 44 Scott Andrews\n\nSergio Pires\n\nMarcel Zalloua Audi 241 12:02'00.8790 - 888 Maro Engel\n\nMaxime Martin\n\nMika\u00ebl Grenier Mercedes 170 7:05'46.3790 - 183 Broc Feeney\n\nRicardo Feller\n\nLiam Talbot Audi 164 6:43'20.0960 - 4 Fabian Schiller\n\nBrenton Grove\n\nStephen Grove Mercedes 53 2:18'40.3170 - 25 Paul Buccini\n\nTom Hayman\n\nRyan Sorensen McLaren 36 1:36'35.3980 - 222 Cameron Waters\n\nCraig Lowndes\n\nTom Randle Mercedes 35 1:27'42.9450",

Having a good car at one of my favourite tracks is amazing.\u201d\n\nVan der Linde was the first to make a climb up the leaderboard, settling the BMW into fifth overall, but only just shy of two tenths off the ultimate pace.\n\nAfter 10 minutes Waters and Marciello were the only Q2 members to sit in the top 10, but the best was yet to come.\n\nThere was no questioning Van der Linde\u2019s pace as he was the first to fire a 2m01s time with 20 minutes left.\n\nThe rapid 2:01.9290 was 0.1990s clear of Auer, while the next best Q2 driver was Marciello in sixth overall, four tenths away.\n\nHe was soon joined by Waters as he kept chipping away in his first stint and shot to seventh before later improving to steal sixth.\n\nBut with the sun out few were able to make major inroads into the top 10 during the early minutes with only Campbell joining them and only van der Linde faster than the top four Q1 cars.\n\nDespite being clearly the fastest on track, not all was well for the #32 BMW as it was under investigation for being in breach of article 4.12.9 shot the lights out, but it was eventually cleared.\n\nTeam GMR ran out of sync with Maro Engel not cutting laps in anger until the second half of the session and this move did not pay off when he ran into traffic.\n\nAfter waiting for seven minutes, Engel finally got to put the foot down and he went straight to third overall with a solid 2:02.2230.\n\nBut Waters was going even faster as he shot to second, sitting just 0.1820s away from van der Linde.\n\nWith five minutes on the clock, Campbell and Q1 member Schiller were on the bubble as Stolz set a purple opening sector go from 11th to third.\n\nFeller and Heinrich were also late movers, rising from outside the top 14 to occupy the first positions on the leaderboard.\n\nFeller was leading the assault, posting a 2:01.8940 with just 0.03s covering the top three as suddenly the top six were all Q2 members.\n\nWith engine issues on the 12th placed #46 BMW of Marciello, all eyes were on Campbell in the final minutes with Q1 driver Andrews hanging onto the final Pole Battle ticket.\n\nAt the start of his final lap, Campbell ran slightly wide coming out of Griffins Bend, but bounced back with a personal best second sector.\n\nHowever, another small moment at the Chase ended up being the final blow with the defending winner heading to the pits.\n\nGunn was the last to have a crack and could only manage 13th.\n\nThe Allan Simonsen Pole Award will be determined by the Pole Battle where the top 10 cars chase perfection across 15 short, sharp minutes.\n\nThat all fires up at 16.05 AEDT.\n\nMeguiar\u2019s Bathurst 12 Hour combined Qualifying results\n\nimage: Mark Horsburgh\n\nREAD THE LATEST ISSUE OF AUTO ACTION HERE\n\nDon\u2019t forget the print edition of Auto Action available via subscription here.

            "content": "If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at Linde ( ) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Linde is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.13 = US$8.7b \u00f7 (US$83b - US$14b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nTherefore, Linde has an ROCE of 13%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Chemicals industry average of 8.1% it's much better.\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Linde's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Linde Tell Us?\n\nLinde has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 215% over the last five years. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Linde's ROCE\n\nIn summary, we're delighted to see that Linde has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And a remarkable 121% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Linde can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\n\nOne more thing to note, we've identified and understanding these should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free\n\nIf you're looking to trade Linde , open an account with the lowest-cost platform trusted by professionals, Interactive Brokers.

This prestigious endurance race takes place at the iconic Mount Panorama circuit and features a multi-class format which showcases outstanding talent from both local and international racing scenes. The event is scheduled for early February 2025, and it promises to deliver thrilling motorsport action.\n\nThe Bathurst 12 Hour is classified by different vehicle categories: Class A contest is characterized by cars in FIA GT3 homologation, sharing the track with competitors from Pro, Pro-Am, Silver, and Bronze Cup. Meanwhile, Class B prioritizes Porsche Carrera Cup vehicles, and Class C is reserved for FIA GT4 homologated cars. An additional Class I, the Invitational Cup, welcomes vehicles like the IRC GT and GT2, which don\u2019t neatly fit within the standard classifications. This diverse framework allows various performance levels to compete on equal footing.\n\nThis year, one of the returning and prominent figures is Valentino Rossi, the MotoGP legend who\u2019s participating with the de facto BMW factory team. Rossi is poised to race alongside Charles Weerts and Rafaelle Marciello in the #46 car. Meanwhile, the sister #32 entry will feature Augusto Farfus, Sheldon van der Linde, and Kelvin van der Linde. BMW has made its mark at the Bathurst 12 Hour recently; last year\u2019s installment saw the #46 entry finish fifth, with Rossi and his teammates eager to improve upon their positioning this time. \"We\u2019re aiming for more,\" he stated, reflecting on the team\u2019s ambitions.\n\nOn the Ferrari front, incoming competitor Will Brown makes his return with the famed marque, teaming with Chaz Mostert and Brazilian driver Daniel Serra. After clinching the GT World Challenge Australia title last year, Brown has shifted from his previous Audi R8 LMS to join Mostert and Serra, marking Ferrari's comeback to the Bathurst 12 Hour after last participating in 2020. All three drivers are vying for their first victory at this storied event. \"It\u2019s cool to team up with Chaz, who\u2019s really the benchmark here in Australia. He\u2019s got the speed and the skills, and I\u2019m excited to learn from him,\" Brown noted.\n\nChaz Mostert himself has shown promise with previous performances but has yet to secure the overall victory at Bathurst. During his earlier outings, Mostert made headlines with pole positions and class wins but admits the outright win has eluded him so far. Mostert expressed, \"Joining Arise Racing for their inaugural Bathurst 12 Hour campaign is thrilling. We\u2019re aiming to showcase to the world the capabilities of our team.\" His enthusiasm for working with Brown and Serra is palpable, signifying high expectations for the team\u2019s performance.\n\nOther Supercars full-timers making waves at Bathurst include Cam Waters and Thomas Randle, set to share the Scott Taylor Motorsport Mercedes-AMG GT3, alongside Craig Lowndes again this year, who returns for his second consecutive Bathurst. Encouraging developments also emerge from the Arise Racing team, with Jaxon Evans co-driving their second Ferrari entry. Brown\u2019s fellow Supercars teammate, Broc Feeney, recently secured a late drive with the Melbourne Performance Centre Audi. Feeney certainly has expectations as he explores the unfamiliar Audi, \"It\u2019s going to be a learning weekend for me since I\u2019ve never driven one before.\" Nevertheless, he is pumped about the chance to contribute to the team\u2019s effort this weekend.\n\nThe Bathurst 12 Hour Race is poised to be a strong display of teamwork, driver skill, and sheer perseverance from all participants. Observers will read between the lines of driver exchanges and team strategies leading up to the event, setting the stage for what promises to be another unforgettable endurance race at Mount Panorama.\n\nWith each competitor hoping to claim the title, fans are set for thrilling performances and might even bare witness to historic triumphs. The camaraderie and engagement among these elite drivers and teams not only enrich the event but also signify the racing spirit alive and well at the Bathurst 12 Hour. Will this year finally see Ferrari\u2019s triumphant return, or will Rossi and BMW write off their own please? Only time will tell as the engines roar and the clock counts down to what should be another legendary race.",

[Sheldon\u2019s] gone on his journey with BMW and I carried on with my journey with Audi.\n\n\u201cI think it was the right time for us to reunite.\n\n\u201cThis race is one that\u2019s very special to both of us, one that we both haven\u2019t won, one that BMW hasn\u2019t won in the GT3 regulations.\n\n\u201cA lot of cool things come together, which maybe make for a bit of excitement in trying to tick this one off.\u201d\n\nSheldon feels those seven years apart, often racing for rival manufacturers in GT3 competition, have helped shape them as different types of drivers.\n\nTwenty-five-year-old Sheldon, who won the 2022 DTM championship, has gone on to becoming one of BMW\u2019s star drivers in its M Hybrid V8 LMDh car, while Kelvin was most recently an ABT-contracted driver and also spent a season in the FIA World Endurance Championship with Akkodis-ASP\u2019s Lexus LMGT3 program.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at very different points in our careers now than back then in Audi,\u201d said Sheldon.\n\n\u201cObviously I was just starting up. It was my first works contract with Audi that year and he was kind of showing me the ropes.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019ve both established ourselves in the last five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve driven DTM against each other. We\u2019re very different drivers and very different people as well because we\u2019re a lot older.\n\n\u201cIt will be exciting to see how different it is driving together, [seven] years later, than what it was back then.\u201d\n\nThe last time brothers won a race at Bathurst was nearly 30 years ago, when David and Geoff Brabham took a factory-supported BMW 320i touring car to victory in the 1997 Bathurst 1000 Super Touring car race.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s a good omen,\u201d said Kelvin. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting but I don\u2019t want to call it too early because I\u2019ve tried this race so many times and had the opportunity to win and in the end it didn\u2019t work out.\n\n\u201cI want to come here with a level head.\n\n\u201cYes, we do have all of the ingredients. WRT is mega on pit road. My brother put the lap in for pole last year, so he\u2019s very comfortable here.\n\n\u201cAugusto has also been here in the past and I had the podium here last year.\n\n\u201cAll of us have a good relationship with the race. Just all three of us are missing that win.\u201d\n\nKelvin: Rolex 24 Served as \u2018Good Prep\u2019 for Bathurst\n\nThe elder van der Linde, who got his first laps in BMW\u2019s GT3 challenger in last weekend\u2019s Rolex 24 at Daytona, feels the race offered him good prep for Bathurst, despite noticeable differences in car and series specifications.\n\nKelvin helped take Paul Miller Racing\u2019s Michelin-shod, EVO-spec BMW to a fourth place class finish in GTD Pro.\n\n\u201cI was relatively surprised by the performance in Daytona,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be in the mix so quickly, having done limited mileage at the Roar and jumping straight into the race, I had very low expectations for myself.\n\n\u201cIt was just to get mileage before coming here, and this was really the race I was gunning for, to be ready for.\n\n\u201cI think Daytona worked out even better than I expected. I felt straight away comfortable with the car. I think the experience with the Lexus [in WEC] helped me a lot more than I initially though, just having that concept of car.\n\n\u201cI come here, honestly, ready to go for it.\u201d",

However, there might be some help for pacers because of the overcast conditions.\n\nPC vs MICT: Predicted XIs:\n\nPretoria Capitals: Will Jacks, Will Smeed, Kyle Verreynne (c & wk), Ashton Turner, Marques Ackerman, Keagan Lion Cachet, Senuran Muthusamy, Thomas Stewart Rogers, Migael Pretorius, Eathan Bosch, Gideon Peters\n\nMI Cape Town: Rassie van der Dussen, Ryan Rickelton (wk), Reeza Hendricks, Colin Ingram, Dewald Brevis, George Linde, Corbin Bosch, Delano Potgieter, Rashid Khan (c), Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult\n\nSuggested Dream11 Fantasy Team No. 1 PC vs MICT Dream11:\n\nPC vs MICT Dream11 Team 1\n\nWicket-keepers: Kyle Verreynne, Ryan Rickelton\n\nBatter: Rassie van der Dussen\n\nAll-rounders: George Linde, Corbin Bosch, Senuran Muthusamy, Will Jacks\n\nBowlers: Rashid Khan, Thomas Stewart Rogers, Eathan Bosch, Delano Potgieter\n\nCaptain First-Choice: Ryan Rickelton || Captain Second-Choice: Corbin Bosch\n\nVice-Captain First-Choice: Rashid Khan || Vice-captain Second-Choice: Rassie van der Dussen\n\nSuggested Dream11 Fantasy Team No. 2 PC vs MICT Dream11:\n\nPC vs MICT Dream11 Team 2\n\nWicket-keepers: Kyle Verreynne, Ryan Rickelton\n\nBatter: Rassie van der Dussen, Reeza Hendricks, Ashton Turner\n\nAll-rounders: George Linde, Corbin Bosch, Senuran Muthusamy, Will Jacks\n\nBowlers: Rashid Khan, Eathan Bosch\n\nCaptain First-Choice: Will Jacks|| Captain Second-Choice: Senuran Muthusamy\n\nVice-Captain First-Choice: George Linde || Vice-captain Second-Choice: Reeza Hendricks\n\nPC vs MICT: Dream11 Prediction \u2013 Who Will Win?\n\nMI Cape Town have been brilliant in both departments.

            "content": "The KION Group is the largest manufacturer of industrial lift trucks in Europe and the second-largest manufacturer of lift trucks globally. Its brands include Linde, Still and Baoli.\n\nFor cargo and container handling applications at ports, depots and other facilities KION Heavy Trucks offers models based on its 8-18 ton forklifts, the HT80-100, H100-180, HT100Ds-180Ds & E100-180 series, which are available in hydrostatic, hydrodynamic/torque converter & medium voltage lithium and lead acid powertrains globally.\n\nThese machines are made at KION facilities in Xiamen, China, which has a capacity of 600 units per annum, and in the Czech Republic, which has a capacity of 150 machines per annum.\n\nFor KION, one of the main trends in the industry is lift truck customisation. \u201cSpecial applications are the driver in our sales and for this KION maintains a dedicated Heavy Truck R&D team specialised in developing custom solutions both in our China and Europe plants\u201d, said Jimmy Lozada Global Sales Manager \u2013 Heavy Trucks, at KION.\n\n\u201cNearly 70 % of our heavier forklifts are delivered with a custom solution or attachment, not many with just forks,\u201d Lozada added. \u201cWe develop and produce in-house a wide range of carriages, clamps, attachments, and spreaders for the most diverse applications. KION also cooperates with various third-party solution providers, integrating and testing in our facilities solutions before delivering to customers.\u201d\n\nFor KION, domain knowledge is a key feature of its competitive advantage in the port equipment market. \u201cUnderstanding the application and providing the right tool for the customer\u2019s operations team in a fast and price competitive fashion is the goal of KION\u2019s Heavy Trucks,\u201d said Lozada. \u201cKION has a capillary global network, present in most countries directly or through dealers who are well equipped and trained to respond to any application and service a customer may require.\u201d\n\nBattery electric options\n\nLike most lift truck OEMs, KION is continuing to expand its range of battery electric machines. Launched in 2021, the 1471 series E100-180 models are available with either medium voltage lithium or lead acid batteries.\n\nThe battery electric drive system in the E100\u2013E180 models is based on Linde\u2019s proven 8t electric series \u2013 with dual-motor drive, dual lifting hydraulics and two batteries. The E100-E180 range features two independent drive lines with dual-motor drive for each driven wheel. Each pair of 18kW drive motors is connected to a transmission with a gear ratio of 1:43 and for lifting there are four 25kW lift motors in pairs.\n\nThe operator has the option to use lithium or lead acid battery packs in different capacities without any hardware changes on the machine. This creates flexibility to use lithium batteries, which have higher energy density and faster charging time, or lower-cost lead acid batteries. In addition, operators can switch between the two at any stage of the machine\u2019s lifecycle as required.\n\nLozada said the 1471 series E100-180 have been a success since they were launched in 2021, with the design \u201cproviding a unique seamless exchange between battery technologies and an easy and less demanding power network integration at customer sites compared to competitors in the same range.\u201d KION recently delivered seven lithium battery-powered forklifts to a customer in Argentina where they will be used at a wood processing plant in a remote region.\n\nFor 2025 KION plans to launch a 6-10t high voltage ECB and continue the development of higher tonnage ECB machines and ICE forklifts up to 35t.",

This relationship could be based on robust economic ties and further expanded to include areas such as political relations, trade and investment, education, and people-to-people contacts. He expressed these views during his meeting with Ambassador of Sweden Ms Alexandra Berg Von Linde in Parliament House.\n\nThe NA Speaker highlighted the importance of regular interactions between the political leadership, parliamentarians, and business communities of both countries, believing that such exchanges could elevate the bilateral relationship to new heights. He specifically stressed the need for more frequent dialogue between Pakistani and Swedish parliamentarians, to exchange views and share experiences. He noted that Pakistan could greatly benefit from the extensive 600-year democratic history and experience of Sweden.\n\nThe NA Speaker said that the current parliament is vibrant and has demonstrated remarkable unanimity on matters of national importance. He also mentioned that the revival of the economy, through favourable investment policies and enhanced trade relations with foreign countries, is the government\u2019s top priority. To this end, the Speaker pointed out that the government has created a favourable environment for foreign investment by introducing various incentives and reforms in the economic sector. He urged Swedish investors to explore opportunities in key sectors such as energy generation, telecommunications, oil exploration, trade, and manufacturing, where significant potential for growth exists.\n\nAyaz Sadiq also conveyed Pakistan\u2019s appreciation for its relations with Sweden, particularly the contributions made by Swedish companies operating in Pakistan\u2019s economy. Additionally, he shared details of his recent initiatives aimed at making the National Assembly more vibrant and responsive to the needs of the people.\n\nAmbassador of Sweden, Ms Alexandra Berg von Linde, expressed Sweden\u2019s strong commitment to strengthening its friendship with Pakistan and considered it a key economic partner. She noted that the Swedish business community recognizes the vast economic potential of Pakistan and is eager to tap into it. The Ambassador further emphasized that increasing parliamentary engagement between the two countries would help fortify the existing positive relationship. She mentioned that the Swedish Parliament, the Riksdag, would adopt a realistic, issue-driven approach to enhancing cooperation between the two legislatures.

            "content": "The office leasing malaise caused by the pandemic looks like it\u2019s starting to lift, and BXP\u2019s fourth quarter of 2024 is proving that. BXP posted its strongest leasing quarter since 2019, with 83 deals closed in the final three months of 2024 totaling 2.3 million square feet.\n\nBXP\u2019s strong leasing quarter compares with 2.5 million square feet it achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 1.1 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThe real estate investment trust\u2019s fourth-quarter leasing activity helped its portfolio see an occupancy boost of 50 basis points to 87.5 percent, the firm announced during its quarterly earnings call Wednesday. And the average lengths of a new lease signed in the fourth quarter was 10.3 years, according to BXP.\n\nAll told, BXP (formerly called Boston Properties (BXP)) signed a total of 5.6 million square feet of leases in 2024, up from 4.2 million in 2023.\n\nBXP\u2019s central business district (CBD) portfolio finished the fourth quarter at 92.8 percent leased, up slightly from 92.7 percent a year earlier. CBD assets account for nearly 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenues, according to Michael LaBelle, chief financial officer at BXP.\n\nDoug Linde, president of BXP, said leasing activity is strongest in its properties in Midtown Manhattan and the Back Bay area of Boston with \u201csparse\u201d availability. It also has signs that negative absorption trends have stopped in San Francisco, Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia.\n\nHe said while some technology companies are reducing their headcounts, the legal industry is displaying a strong interest in leasing more office space, particularly in New York and Boston.\n\n\u201cWe accomplished a lot of leasing and a lot of renewals in `24 and we expect `25 will be a year of modest leased square footage increases as we focus on leasing vacant space and known expirations,\u201d Linde said on the earnings call. \u201cWhen we get to `26 and `27 there is going to be very little expiration headwinds. If we lease at a pace anything like `24 and what we hope to accomplish in `25, we will see our lease percentage accelerate.\u201d\n\nLinde added that the company plans to take a few suburban office assets \u201cout of service\u201d and explore converting them to residential use. He said a proposal from BXP announced last summer to transform an office building at 17 Hartwell Avenue in Lexington, Mass., northwest of Boston represents an example of what it is looking to do more of across its suburban office portfolio.\n\nDespite the strong leasing, BXP reported that it experienced a net income loss of $230 million, or $1.45 per share, compared with net income of $119.9 million, or 76 cents per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2023. The REIT attributed the loss largely to $341.3 million of \u201cnon-cash impairment charges\u201d on investments with \u201cunconsolidated joint ventures\u201d tied to the Colorado Center in Santa Monica, Calif., Gateway Commons in San Francisco, and Safeco Plaza in Seattle.\n\nRevenue for the quarter increased 3.6 percent to $858.6 million compared to $828.9 million for the same time last year. Funds from operations for the quarter finished at $284 million, or $1.79 per diluted share, a drop from $286.2 million, or $1.82 per diluted share, reported in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAndrew Coen can be reached at acoen@commercialobserver.com.",

            "content": "The Rolex 24 at Daytona is one of the world\u2019s most historic and prestigious endurance races and is also the opening round of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC). It sets the tone for the rest of the season, and BMW teams showed they will be competitive this year by running at the front in both prototype and GT classes and narrowly missing out on podium finishes.\n\nThere were five BMWs on the entry for this year\u2019s Rolex 24 at Daytona. In the top-tier GTP class, BMW M Team RLL was there with the #24 M Hybrid V8 driven by Philipp Eng, Dries Vanthoor, Kevin Magnussen, and Raffaele Marciello, and the #25 car driven by Marco Wittmann, Sheldon van der Linde, Robin Frijns and Rene Rast. In GTD Pro, Paul Miller Racing had a pair of M4 GT3 EVOs, with the #1 car driven by Madison Snow, Neil Verhagen, Connor De Phillippi, and Kelvin van der Linde. The #48 car was driven by Max Hesse, Dan Harper, Jesse Krohn, and Augusto Farfus. In GTD, Turner Motorsport had the sole BMW entry, with Robby Foley, Patrick Gallagher, Jake Walker, and Jens Klingmann in the #96 M4 GT3 EVO.\n\nThe GTP class is the top tier of the IWSC. Porsche Penske Motorsport came in as the team to beat, having won the championship in 2024, but BMW M Team RLL showed that they will be much more of a factor in the championship this year than last. In qualifying, Dries Vanthoor put the #24 M Hybrid V8 on the GTP class pole with a 1:33.895 lap, followed by the #93 Acura and the #7 Porsche. The top five cars were within a half-second of each other in qualifying. Unfortunately, Sheldon van der Linde didn\u2019t get a chance to put a fast lap in with the #25 M Hybrid V8, as there was a failure in the high-voltage hybrid system that caused the car to stall out on track.\n\nIn GTD Pro qualifying, Dan Harper (who was in his debut race in IMSA) put the #48 M4 GT3 EVO into third on the grid behind a pair of Ford Mustang GT3s. He was less than five-tenths of a second off the pole time. In GTD, Robby Foley drove the #96 Turner M4 GT3 EVO to thirteenth on the grid with a 1:47.281 lap, with the pole going to the #120 Wright Motorsport Porsche with a 1:46.634. The top fifteen GTD cars were within a second of each other in qualifying.\n\nAt the start of the race, Dries Vanthoor held the lead and quickly built a gap between himself and the rest of the field. When he came in for his first pit stop, he held a 24-second lead, but he misjudged the pit box entry and hit the pit wall with the front of the car. The team then got a penalty on that car for refueling while it was up on jacks, which is prohibited. The team fought back and ran in second and third by three hours into the race, with the #25 running ahead of the #25. In GTD Pro, Dan Harper moved into the front when the leading #9 Lamborghini had a holdup in the pits.\n\nAs often happens at Daytona, attrition played a key factor in the race. Max Hesse was leading GTD Pro in the #48 M4 GT3 EVO in the eighth hour when he was caught in a multi-car accident. Hesse managed to avoid the cars that were crashing in front of him but was hit hard in the rear by the #9 Lamborghini. The team got the car back out on track, but they were several laps down. By midway through the race, the #1 Paul Miller Racing M4 GT3 EVO had moved into the lead in GTD Pro, while the M Hybrid V8s were running in fifth (24) and seventh (25). The #96 Turner Motorsport M4 GT3 EVO was running in third in GTD.\n\nAs the sun rose Sunday morning and the race entered its final hours, there was more drama involving the BMWs. Augusto Farfus was at the wheel of the #1 Paul Miller Racing M4 GT4 EVO that was several laps down when the GTD Pro leading #4 Corvette caught up to him, with Connor De Phillippi in second behind the Corvette in the #1 Paul Miller M4 GT3 EVO. The trio ran nose to tail for several laps when De Phillippi and the #4 Corvette driven by Tommy Milner made contact in the International Horseshoe turn, which resulted in rear bodywork damage to the Corvette. Farfus was penalized for blocking, but the #1 eventually moved into the lead in GTD Pro.\n\nIn the closing hour, the #24 M Hybrid V8 was plagued by a drivability issue when the front bodywork became loose, which led Dries Vanthoor to bring the car into the pits to replace the nose of the car with just 30 minutes left. It dropped the car to fourth in GTP behind the winning #7 Porsche, the #60 Acura, and the #6 Porsche. The #25 BMW finished in seventh. \u201cOf course, we had hoped for a different outcome of the Daytona weekend,\u201d said BMW M CEO Franciscus van Meel. \u201cWith 50 minutes left, we were in the fight for the win in all categories. Everyone could see how fast and reliable our car is. The drivers and the teams did a great job and made no mistakes. But that\u2019s racing.\u201d\n\nIn GTD Pro, the #1 Paul Miller Racing M4 GT3 EVO driven by Kelvin van der Linde was running in the top three when he was tagged by a Corvette going into turn one, which dropped them to fourth at the finish. The #65 Ford Mustang GT3 took the win, followed by the #3 Corvette and the #64 Ford Mustang. The #48 Paul Miller Racing BMW ended up in twelfth. In GTD, the Turner Motorsport team had a solid race to finish in fifth, with the class win going to the #13 Corvette, which was followed on the podium by the #120 Porsche and the #27 Aston Martin.\n\nThe second longest IMSA endurance race of the year takes place in mid-March, with the 12 Hours of Sebring at Sebring International Raceway in Florida, just three hours south of Daytona. If the Daytona race is anything to go by, it promises to be another exciting race. BMW of North America will also be celebrating the 50th Anniversary of their overall win at Sebring in 1975 with the 3.0 CSL.\n\n\u2014David Haueter\n\n[Photo by David Haueter]",

Air Liquide\u2019s market segments are dominated by packaged gases (63%), followed by bulk (32%).\n\nNippon Gases UK are recent entrants to the market after having bought Praxair\u2019s gas business in the country when Linde was required to divest that as part of the Linde-Praxair merger in 2019 \u2013 it has a market share of 6% ($112m).\n\nThe rest of the market is fragmented between smaller local producers and distributors, with this amount collectively estimated at $54m (3%).\n\nMedical oxygen understandably soared during the pandemic years, rising to 472 and 474 tonnes per day (tpd) in 2020 and 2021 respectively, but has since stabilised to 248 tpd in 2024.\n\nEstimated total merchant CO2 demand totalled around 1,512 tpd in 2024 with the majority supplied to F&B manufacturers.\n\nThe report also contains insights on ASUs, oxygen and nitrogen, CO2 and hydrogen plants, along with latest market developments.\n\nIn September 2024, Tata Steel closed its last remaining blast furnace at the Port Talbot steelworks, ending over a century of traditional steelmaking in the region.\n\nBut the report forecasts there will still be production at the BOC Margam ASU location to continue serving their other customers.\n\n\u201cThen, in 2027, when the electric arc furnace (EAF) for Tata Steel is scheduled to come online, we expect some more gas will once again be required \u2026 from this Margam location \u2013 albeit not as much as they required with the blast furnaces, due to the fact that EAFs use far less oxygen.\u201d\n\nFor further insights and access to the full analysis, email: [email protected]",

            "content": "Daytona. For more than 23 hours, BMW M Team RLL and Paul Miller Racing had their sights set on victory at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA), but a dramatic final stage dashed all hopes of a well-deserved reward for a great performance by BMW M Motorsport at the season opener of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC). Dries Vanthoor (BEL), who had secured pole position in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, collided with a competitor while fighting for second place and fell to fourth place due to the subsequent repairs. A similar fate befell Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, who was also contending for the win but ultimately had to settle for fourth position in the GTD-PRO class after an incident.\n\nDespite the disappointment over the frustrating final stage of the race, BMW M Motorsport looks back on a very strong race weekend at Daytona. Both the BMW M Hybrid V8 and the BMW M4 GT3 EVO demonstrated their enormous potential and made a significant impact on the track. Vanthoor, starting as the lead driver for the #24 from pole position \u2013 the first for BMW M Motorsport's LMDh project \u2013 built a 25-second lead in his first double-stint. Although this was levelled by numerous yellow flag periods, it underscored the strength of the vehicle. The same applies to the fastest race lap, which Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) drove in 1:35.868 minutes in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 which also showed impressive speed but fell back due to several incidents, finishing in seventh place. Both BMW M Hybrid V8s had no technical issues.\n\nIn the GTD-PRO class, Paul Miller Racing played several leading roles. The #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO led the race into the evening but was then hit by an opponent in a mass collision. The heavily damaged vehicle was repaired thanks to the great efforts of the mechanics but lost many laps and crossed the finish line in twelfth place. The sister #1 car stepped up, moved up from its 13th starting position, and fought for the win until just before the end. Kelvin van der Linde had the podium in sight at his race debut for BMW M Motorsport until he was forced into a spin by an opponent and fell back to fourth place. In the GTD class, Turner Motorsport also gave a strong performance, finishing the race with the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in fifth place.\n\nNote to editors:\n\nYou can find video interviews with BMW M Motorsport head Andreas Roos and the BMW M factory drivers, as well as footage from Daytona for editorial use at the following link: https://f.io/bX42CP2u.\n\nComments after the 24h Daytona:\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \"Of course we had hoped for a different outcome of the Daytona weekend. With 50 minutes left, we were in the fight for the win in all categories. Everyone could see how fast and reliable our car is. The drivers and the teams did a great job and made no mistakes. But that's racing.\"\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \u201cA big thank you to the entire team. Unfortunately, we had a weekend of ups and downs. If we only look at the race results, we cannot be satisfied with the fourth places in the GTP and GTD PRO classes. We started the weekend well, achieving very good results in both the free practice sessions and in qualifying \u2013 with Dries Vanthoor on pole position (GTP) and Dan Harper in third place (GTD PRO). That was very promising. For much of the race, we were able to compete for class victories and even the overall win. That's the positive we want to take with us. When you fight for the top positions in a 24-hour race for so long though, it is ultimately sad and disappointing for the teams and drivers who have invested a lot of work to get there - it would have been deserved to win at least one, if not the winner's trophy. Nevertheless, we must take the positives: the strong trend from 2024 clearly continues, we were able to build on it and field a competitive car in the GTP class here. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO has also shown in its third race that it can compete against the toughest competition \u2013 also in IMSA.\u201d\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 4th place): \u201cI want to say a massive congratulations to my brother. If there is someone who should win the race if it is not me then it is my brother. He has had a good time in the last couple of races and seasons and I am very happy for him. I for sure am very gutted with this result. We showed a great pace and that the car is capable of doing it. Obviously finishing in P4 in a 24 hour race is not the end of the world, but at the end of the day it is very sad to fight for 22 hours and not come home with a podium, which we for sure deserved. I feel sorry for the guys, who have been working very hard and also to my teammates. I would have loved to gift them with something, but most important is that we showed that we were strong and able to fight. We will make sure to come back and we will win this race.\u201d\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 7th place): \u201cIt was a very disappointing ending to the race for us. We had a very good package to fight for the win, which we showed all week long so we were quite positive heading into the race. Unfortunately we had a small issue in the pit stop with the brake change. That cost us three laps and we never really manage to make it back again. Obviously that was not the reward we wanted to give all the guys for the hard work all over the winter trying to make sure we have a fast car that is able to fight for the win. But we will definitely take a lot of notes from the race weekend, try to improve for Sebring and really bring that podium home.\u201d\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 4th place GTD PRO): \u201cIt is a proud moment for me, fighting the whole race for the win. It was a good mileage for me, learning the car for the first time. To narrowly have missed out on the win is more than I could have ever expected. It was unfortunate as we led the race for the last two hours. The last pit stop was where we unfortunately lost track position and we weren\u2019t really able to overtake looking forward. The rest is history. We will come back and try again next time.\u201d\n\nMax Hesse (# 48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 12th place GTD PRO):\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I would like to express a huge thank you to BMW M Motorsport and Paul Miller Racing. It was the first time I was able to start here. It's a very cool event and it remains my dream to win here someday. This year, we definitely had the package to do it. Unfortunately, we were involved in a big crash, which was not our fault. I was very well warned by my team, but unfortunately, our competitors behind us were not. That's part of it. Our car ran great. The mechanics did a top job getting us back on track. I think we've gained good experience for Sebring - and there we'll try to go full attack again.\u201d\n\nAugusto Farfus (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 12th place GTD PRO): \u201cThe situation with the Corvette and our sister car was very difficult. My intention was to support my teammate in the sister car in the fight for victory. I was aware that it was hard racing. The situation that led to the collision between the Corvette and Connor De Phillippi behind me was very unfortunate \u2013 but I had nothing to do with it directly. I stayed on my inside line.\u201d\n\nJens Klingmann (#96 BMW M4 GT 3 EVO, Turner Motorsport, 5th place GTD):\n\n\u201cLooking solely at the result, fifth place for Turner Motorsport was the best 24-hour race at Daytona. On the other hand, we entered to win. Therefore, we are very frustrated. Half an hour before the end of the race, we were in second place and had done many things right up to that point. When you then finish in fifth place, at first glance you tend to see the negatives, but we gave it our all, and that was the maximum we could achieve with the overall package. I am still proud that after the BMW M4 GT3 was already capable of winning in its first two dress rehearsals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, we also had the cars in the lead for a long time here and once again proved that the car has the potential to win races. This gives me a positive outlook; we will take this experience home, continue working, and then I think it will still be a very successful season.\u201d",

The opening pair's 75-run partnership in just 8.1 overs laid a solid foundation for the chase.Dewald Brevis (26 not out off 16 balls) and George Linde (29 not out off 8 balls) provided the finishing touches, with Linde's explosive hitting against Marcus Stoinis proving particularly destructive.Linde smashed four sixes in a single over, propelling MI Cape Town to their target of 150 runs with 5.1 overs to spare.Earlier, the Durban's Super Giants found themselves in a precarious position at 22/4 before Heinrich Klaasen (66 off 43 balls) and Kane Williamson (56 not out off 44 balls) steadied the innings.Their efforts helped the visitors post a competitive total of 149/6, but it ultimately proved insufficient against MI Cape Town's formidable batting lineup.The defeat leaves the Durban's Super Giants precariously positioned in the race for playoff qualification, with their chances of progressing further in the tournament hanging by a thread.Lance Klusener's side will need to regroup and deliver exceptional performances in their remaining matches to keep their hopes alive.Overall, the match showcased the depth and firepower of MI Cape Town's batting unit, while also highlighting the Durban's Super Giants' struggles to maintain consistency throughout the tournament.",

Dewald Brevis (26 not out off 16 balls) and George Linde (29 not out off eight balls) finished the job with 5.1 overs to spare.Linde, whose all-round brilliance included bowling figures of 1 for 20 and a whirlwind cameo, attributed his form to a fresh perspective: \"I took a nice long break away from cricket because mentally I wasn't there anymore. Spending time with family and friends brought back the hunger, and now I'm just enjoying cricket with a smile on my face.\"Reflecting on MI Cape Town's resurgence, he credited the team's cohesion and the return of Rashid Khan as captain: \"There's a different vibe in the camp. Rashid knows the players well, and you can see the hunger to succeed, especially after the tough past seasons. We owe it to ourselves and the fans.\"On his explosive batting, Linde noted his calmness under pressure: \"The game always tells you what to do. I focus on what the team needs from me. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but I trust my experience and instincts.\"Durban's Super Giants, meanwhile, continued to struggle. Despite a valiant 121-run partnership between Heinrich Klaasen (66 off 43 balls) and Kane Williamson (56 not out off 44 balls) after a disastrous start at 22 for 4, the team fell short.Coach Lance Klusener acknowledged the disappointment: \"At 22 for 4, it's tough. Klaasen and Williamson's partnership was outstanding, but overall, our batters haven't been consistent. If they don't score, the bowlers are always under pressure. It's a challenge in franchise cricket - you hope players are in form, and when they're not, it's a battle.\"MI Cape Town's balance and depth have been pivotal, as Klusener observed: \"Their bowling attack is outstanding, and their top order is firing. That's why they're excelling.\"The victory not only solidified MI Cape Town's strong season but also highlighted their determination to deliver for their fans, as Linde summarised: \"We're playing for ourselves, the franchise, and the people who support us. It's been a special season so far.\"",

            "content": "Daytona. For more than 23 hours, BMW M Team RLL and Paul Miller Racing had their sights set on victory at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA), but a dramatic final stage dashed all hopes of a well-deserved reward for a great performance by BMW M Motorsport at the season opener of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC). Dries Vanthoor (BEL), who had secured pole position in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, collided with a competitor while fighting for second place and fell to fourth place due to the subsequent repairs. A similar fate befell Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, who was also contending for the win but ultimately had to settle for fourth position in the GTD-PRO class after an incident.\n\nDespite the disappointment over the frustrating final stage of the race, BMW M Motorsport looks back on a very strong race weekend at Daytona. Both the BMW M Hybrid V8 and the BMW M4 GT3 EVO demonstrated their enormous potential and made a significant impact on the track. Vanthoor, starting as the lead driver for the #24 from pole position \u2013 the first for BMW M Motorsport's LMDh project \u2013 built a 25-second lead in his first double-stint. Although this was levelled by numerous yellow flag periods, it underscored the strength of the vehicle. The same applies to the fastest race lap, which Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) drove in 1:35.868 minutes in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 which also showed impressive speed but fell back due to several incidents, finishing in seventh place. Both BMW M Hybrid V8s had no technical issues.\n\nIn the GTD-PRO class, Paul Miller Racing played several leading roles. The #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO led the race into the evening but was then hit by an opponent in a mass collision. The heavily damaged vehicle was repaired thanks to the great efforts of the mechanics but lost many laps and crossed the finish line in twelfth place. The sister #1 car stepped up, moved up from its 13th starting position, and fought for the win until just before the end. Kelvin van der Linde had the podium in sight at his race debut for BMW M Motorsport until he was forced into a spin by an opponent and fell back to fourth place. In the GTD class, Turner Motorsport also gave a strong performance, finishing the race with the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in fifth place.\n\nNote to editors:\n\nYou can find video interviews with BMW M Motorsport head Andreas Roos and the BMW M factory drivers, as well as footage from Daytona for editorial use at the following link: https://f.io/bX42CP2u.\n\nComments after the 24h Daytona:\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \"Of course we had hoped for a different outcome of the Daytona weekend. With 50 minutes left, we were in the fight for the win in all categories. Everyone could see how fast and reliable our car is. The drivers and the teams did a great job and made no mistakes. But that's racing.\"\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \u201cA big thank you to the entire team. Unfortunately, we had a weekend of ups and downs. If we only look at the race results, we cannot be satisfied with the fourth places in the GTP and GTD PRO classes. We started the weekend well, achieving very good results in both the free practice sessions and in qualifying \u2013 with Dries Vanthoor on pole position (GTP) and Dan Harper in third place (GTD PRO). That was very promising. For much of the race, we were able to compete for class victories and even the overall win. That's the positive we want to take with us. When you fight for the top positions in a 24-hour race for so long though, it is ultimately sad and disappointing for the teams and drivers who have invested a lot of work to get there - it would have been deserved to win at least one, if not the winner's trophy. Nevertheless, we must take the positives: the strong trend from 2024 clearly continues, we were able to build on it and field a competitive car in the GTP class here. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO has also shown in its third race that it can compete against the toughest competition \u2013 also in IMSA.\u201d\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 4th place): \u201cI want to say a massive congratulations to my brother. If there is someone who should win the race if it is not me then it is my brother. He has had a good time in the last couple of races and seasons and I am very happy for him. I for sure am very gutted with this result. We showed a great pace and that the car is capable of doing it. Obviously finishing in P4 in a 24 hour race is not the end of the world, but at the end of the day it is very sad to fight for 22 hours and not come home with a podium, which we for sure deserved. I feel sorry for the guys, who have been working very hard and also to my teammates. I would have loved to gift them with something, but most important is that we showed that we were strong and able to fight. We will make sure to come back and we will win this race.\u201d\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 7th place): \u201cIt was a very disappointing ending to the race for us. We had a very good package to fight for the win, which we showed all week long so we were quite positive heading into the race. Unfortunately we had a small issue in the pit stop with the brake change. That cost us three laps and we never really manage to make it back again. Obviously that was not the reward we wanted to give all the guys for the hard work all over the winter trying to make sure we have a fast car that is able to fight for the win. But we will definitely take a lot of notes from the race weekend, try to improve for Sebring and really bring that podium home.\u201d\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 4th place GTD PRO): \u201cIt is a proud moment for me, fighting the whole race for the win. It was a good mileage for me, learning the car for the first time. To narrowly have missed out on the win is more than I could have ever expected. It was unfortunate as we led the race for the last two hours. The last pit stop was where we unfortunately lost track position and we weren\u2019t really able to overtake looking forward. The rest is history. We will come back and try again next time.\u201d\n\nMax Hesse (# 48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 12th place GTD PRO):\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I would like to express a huge thank you to BMW M Motorsport and Paul Miller Racing. It was the first time I was able to start here. It's a very cool event and it remains my dream to win here someday. This year, we definitely had the package to do it. Unfortunately, we were involved in a big crash, which was not our fault. I was very well warned by my team, but unfortunately, our competitors behind us were not. That's part of it. Our car ran great. The mechanics did a top job getting us back on track. I think we've gained good experience for Sebring - and there we'll try to go full attack again.\u201d\n\nAugusto Farfus (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 12th place GTD PRO): \u201cThe situation with the Corvette and our sister car was very difficult. My intention was to support my teammate in the sister car in the fight for victory. I was aware that it was hard racing. The situation that led to the collision between the Corvette and Connor De Phillippi behind me was very unfortunate \u2013 but I had nothing to do with it directly. I stayed on my inside line.\u201d\n\nJens Klingmann (#96 BMW M4 GT 3 EVO, Turner Motorsport, 5th place GTD):\n\n\u201cLooking solely at the result, fifth place for Turner Motorsport was the best 24-hour race at Daytona. On the other hand, we entered to win. Therefore, we are very frustrated. Half an hour before the end of the race, we were in second place and had done many things right up to that point. When you then finish in fifth place, at first glance you tend to see the negatives, but we gave it our all, and that was the maximum we could achieve with the overall package. I am still proud that after the BMW M4 GT3 was already capable of winning in its first two dress rehearsals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, we also had the cars in the lead for a long time here and once again proved that the car has the potential to win races. This gives me a positive outlook; we will take this experience home, continue working, and then I think it will still be a very successful season.\u201d",

            "content": "The 2025 Rolex 24 at Daytona proved to be a rollercoaster for BMW Motorsport, with the BMW M Hybrid V8 showing incredible pace but ultimately falling short of the podium after late-race setbacks. Despite strong performances from both Team RLL entries and the debut of the updated BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the GTD Pro class, the race ended with disappointment for the Bavarian manufacturer.\n\nPromising Start for the BMW M Hybrid V8\n\nTeam RLL\u2019s No. 24 BMW M Hybrid V8, piloted by Dries Vanthoor, Kevin Magnussen, Philipp Eng, and Raffaele Marciello, started on pole position for the first time since the LMDh program was reinstated at BMW. The #24 race car showcased its one-lap speed early in the race leading the pack at times. The No. 25 sister car, driven by Sheldon van der Linde, Ren\u00e9 Rast, Robin Frijns, and Marco Wittmann, also demonstrated exceptional pace during the race, setting the fastest lap of the event with times under 1:36 minutes.\n\nNearly 23 hours in and the BMW M Hybrid V8 #24 was still in contention for victory, locked in a fierce three-way battle with the Penske Porsche 963 racing cars. However, the race took a devastating turn in the final hour when contact with the No. 021 Ferrari driven by James Calado caused damage to the BMW\u2019s bodywork, leading to a puncture. The subsequent pit stop left the team a lap down, and they ultimately finished fourth.\n\nThe No. 25 BMW had good pace as well, but it endured an uphill battle due to a poor starting position and overnight brake change issues that cost two laps. Contact with the Wayne Taylor Racing Cadillac and a puncture compounded the team\u2019s struggles, relegating the car to seventh place overall.\n\nHeartbreak in the GTD Pro Class\n\nBMW\u2019s fortunes in the GTD Pro class mirrored those in GTP. The No. 1 BMW M4 GT3 Evo, driven by Kelvin van der Linde, Connor De Phillippi, Neil Verhagen, and Madison Snow, was poised for a class victory. A fierce duel with Corvette Racing saw the BMW lead much of the race, only to lose its podium chances in the closing minutes. Contact during a heated battle caused the M4 to spin, ending its bid for a top finish.\n\nThe GTD Pro class victory went to Ford Multimatic Motorsports, marking the first race win for the Ford Mustang GT3. Dennis Olsen, sharing the No. 65 car with Chris Mies and Fred Vervisch, took the Blue Oval to glory. A late-race battle for the podium turned chaotic when Nico Varrone made contact with van der Linde\u2019s No. 1 BMW, spinning it at Turn 1 and dashing BMW\u2019s hopes.\n\nIn the aftermath, Alex Sims in the No. 3 Corvette finished second, while the No. 64 Ford Mustang GT3, driven by Mike Rockenfeller, Seb Priaulx, and Austin Cindric, completed the podium.\n\nPorsche\u2019s Triumph and a Historic Victory\n\nPorsche Penske Motorsport emerged victorious, securing its 20th overall win at Daytona. Felipe Nasr, Kevin Estre, and Nick Tandy claimed victory in the No. 7 Porsche 963, with Nasr making decisive overtakes in the final hour. Tandy\u2019s triumph marked a historic achievement as he became the first driver to win the prestigious 24-hour races at Le Mans, Daytona, N\u00fcrburgring, and Spa.\n\nA Race of Highs and Lows for BMW\n\nDespite the disappointing finale, BMW Motorsport\u2019s performance at Daytona showcased the potential of the BMW M Hybrid V8 program. The car\u2019s outright speed and reliability were undeniable, with both entries completing the grueling 24-hour race without major mechanical issues.\n\nBMW Motorsport is now heading to the 12 Hours of Sebring, but without a doubt, they now have their sights grand prize at the iconic 24 hours of Le Mans.

            "content": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 116% in five years.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Linde\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Linde achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.0% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 17% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nNasdaqGS:LIN Earnings Per Share Growth January 25th 2025\n\nDive deeper into Linde's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Linde's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Linde's TSR for the last 5 years was 133%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nLinde provided a TSR of 10% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 18% over five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Linde you should be aware of.",

It was much needed for me - taking wickets, which I haven't done in this competition. On such wickets it's important as a bowling unit to take advantage of the new ball. The way everyone responded in the first 10 overs was impressive. The way they batted from 22/4, taking it to 150 was a brilliant partnership. But as a team we had in the mind that we can be chasing something around 160-170. Wicket was nice, ball was coming on nice. From last two years the way he has been contributing has been outstanding (talking about Rickelton).\n\nMaharaj | DSG captain: Probably lost our way in the powerplay with the bat. Kudos to Klaasy and Kane for getting a score. Pitch got better but we bowled loose balls. It's been that sort of season for us. To put in the processes, coming off the high from last year and to finish where we are. Disappointing. There's lots of glimpses in the bowling that we can be proud of. Fielding was better today.\n\nKlaasen, Player of the Match: It's been a long frustrating campaign. Pity it's too late. I've been there before, so I know exactly what to do. But it's part of the game. I've been hitting the ball nicely. Been doing all the right things. My process has been the same. Was finding ways of getting out. Just part of the game. I still had the confidence that I was hitting the ball well. We just said we'll take it on like a one-day game. Just make sure the strike rotation is good. He's such a calm head. The way he's not fussed about how it looks. It's an attribute every youngster needs to look up to - find ways to score runs.\n\n20:37 Local Time, 18:37 GMT, 00:07 IST: What a finish from Linde who was sent out to achieve the bonus-point win, and he did it with more than an over to spare. Yet another defeat for Super Giants as they remain at the bottom of the table. It was a horror start with the bat for them, losing four wickets in the first 7 overs with just 22 on the board. Klaasen and Williamson led a superb recovery for them with a partnership of 121, but that wasn't enough. The pitch probably got better under lights, and MICT came out all guns blazing as a couple of DSG bowlers bore the brunt of the onslaught.\n\n14.5 Stoinis to Linde, SIX, and he finishes it off in a hurry! Full and wide, Linde reaches out and carves it over point for his fourth six in five balls. MICT win with a bonus point and move back to second spot on the table\n\n14.4 Stoinis to Linde, no run, slower bouncer from Stoinis, manages to deceive Linde who is through the pull early and gets beaten\n\n14.3 Stoinis to Linde, SIX, Linde clears the ropes once more! Six, six, six! Back of a length outside leg, looking to follow Linde as he backs away but he pulls hard and swats it over wide long-on\n\n14.2 Stoinis to Linde, SIX, back-to-back sixes! Good length ball on leg stump, Linde clears the front leg and lofts it over the long-on boundary\n\n14.1 Stoinis to Linde, SIX, he couldn't have struck this any better! Full outside off, Linde goes hard and creams it over extra cover\n\nMarcus Stoinis [2.0-0-17-0] is back into the attack\n\nTimeout! MICT are going for the bonus-point win. They'll achieve it if the target is chased down in under 16 overs.\n\n13.6 Noor Ahmad to Brevis, SIX, too full and punished! It's tossed up, lands right in the slot and Brevis tonks it down the ground for a big six\n\n13.5 Noor Ahmad to Linde, 1 run, Klaasen has dropped a sitter! Slightly short, Linde goes for the pull but it hurries onto him and gets him on the splice. It goes in the air and should've been a dolly for Klaasen coming in from mid-on. But he fails to hang on. Not sure if he was distracted by the thought of Noor going for the catch as well. But Noor had stayed well away\n\n13.4 Noor Ahmad to Linde, no run, tossed up outside off, googly, Linde goes for a slog-sweep but is beaten\n\n13.3 Noor Ahmad to Linde, FOUR, googly outside off, it's short and wide and Linde late-cuts it past slip! Gets off the mark with a boundary\n\nGeorge Linde, left handed bat, comes to the crease\n\n13.2 Noor Ahmad to Sediqullah Atal, out Caught by Williamson!! You just can't keep Noor out of the wickets. Tossed up outside off, Atal looks to sweep but gets a thick top-edge. It goes high in the air and Williamson takes it safely at midwicket. Sediqullah Atal c Williamson b Noor Ahmad 8(8) [4s-1]\n\nNoor Ahmad to Sediqullah Atal, THATS OUT!! Caught!!",

The league, which is in its third season, is gaining a lot of prominence as it looks to make the tournament a top destination for local and international talents.\n\nWe look at a few players who could potentially replace players in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.\n\nLhuan-dre Pretorius\n\nThe 18-year-old rookie player from South Africa, Lhuan-dre Pretorius, has certainly set the SA20 on fire with his audacious strokeplay and consistency, including a 51-ball 97 on debut against Sunrisers Eastern Cape. He is currently on top of the run-scorers chart, which has put Paarl Roayls on top of the points table.\n\nThe southpaw, who can also keep wickets, could be a top option for any team looking for a swashbuckling opener.\n\nLiam Dawson\n\nLiam Dawson's international career might be all but over, but as far as franchise cricket is concerned, the 34-year-old is still going strong. He has been the best spinner in the SA20 so far, with eight scalps at an economy rate of under six.\n\nHe is yet to play in the IPL, but his left-arm spin might come in handy at the latter stages of the tournament when the pitches get slow. Moreover, he is also a handy batter down the order.\n\nGeorge Linde\n\nAnother left-arm spinner who can whack, George Linde, could do extremely well in the IPL. In his first two games in the SA20 he slammed 23* (17) and 48* (35). He showed off his prowess with the ball as well, with 3/15 against MI Cape Town.\n\nLeading into the SA20, he also scored 48 (24) and picked up 4/21 in the same game against Pakistan. An IPL call-up does not look too far-fetched for the 33-year-old.",

            "content": "Another year, and another change in the qualifying procedures at the Daytona 24 Hours. The IMSA SportsCar Championship kicks off on the hallowed banking of the Daytona International Speedway this weekend and there\u2019s still time before you have to settle down in front of your TV, computer or whatever for the sessions on Thursday afternoon in Florida that will set the grid for the big race.\n\nThat\u2019s a change from the past four years in case you\u2019re confused. We knew who would be starting from the front - and from the back - on the Sunday prior to the race from 2021 onwards. The grid was determined during the pre-event \u2018Roar Before the 24\u2019 test, initially after a 100-minute qualifying race and then, following a not-so-positive reaction to its introduction from the teams, a more regular series of qualifying sessions for each of the classes.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to remember sometimes what changed and when at Daytona, the Le Mans 24 Hours and elsewhere, and not just in my world of sportscar racing. It feels like we\u2019re in an age of interminable tweaking - meddling might be a better word - of qualifying systems in motorsport. It\u2019s a 21st century phenomenon as organisers seek to ramp up the spectacle in our modern age of instant gratification.\n\nLest we forget, Formula 1 went along quite nicely with multiple sessions on the first and second day of a grand prix weekend for much of its history. When your author first attended a F1 world championship race, the 1978 British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch, it ran to the then normal schedule of a couple of sessions on Friday and one on Saturday afternoon after what was quaintly - and incorrectly - termed as an untimed session in the morning. It was what we now call free practice by any other name.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1996 that F1 qualifying was cut to a single hour on Saturday. Only in 2003 did the big changes kick in with the introduction of one-lap qualification - and variations thereof - before the shoot-out concept with three mini-sessions arrived in 2006.\n\nLe Mans managed quite nicely, too, with just eight hours of track running over two days for much of its history before a run of minor changes starting circa 2009. Then, Hyperpole came along in 2020. For this year we\u2019ll have a revision or refinement of what an old-timer like me with 30-plus Le Mans under his belt still thinks of as new.\n\nLe Mans qualifying format has seen several changes over the years Photo by: JEP / Motorsport Images\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a three rather than a two-round affair. In the Hypercar class, the fastest 15 entries (up from the previous eight) from a 30-minute session on Wednesday go through to Hyperpole 1 on Thursday, with five getting knocked out ahead of the finale called, wait for it, Hyperpole 2. The thinking behind the new system is to build the drama to a crescendo, more for the TV audience than the paying spectators at the track I suspect.\n\nI\u2019m not saying I was against Hyperpole in its original format, but there was plenty of drama in days of old. That queue of cars at the pitlane exit just before 22:00 as the one-hour break in qualifying drew to a close - sometimes on the Wednesday, more generally on the Thursday - signalled the start of a manic half hour or so. Temperatures were falling along with the sun: it was important to get out in the prime conditions on the resumption before daylight disappeared \u2014 and to try to be at the front of the queue.\n\nAnd what about some of those last-gasp qualifying runs as the clock clicked down to midnight on Thursday? I\u2019m thinking here of the pole-winning heroics of Tomas Enge in Prodrive-built and run Ferrari 550 Maranello GTS and Aston Martin DBR9 GT1 machinery in the 2000s. A driver who notched up five class poles on the trot between 2002 and \u201906 liked leaving it late!\n\nPLUS: Was this the most remarkable Le Mans qualifying lap?\n\nI\u2019m more enthusiastic about Hyperpole 2.0. That\u2019s because the Hypercar contenders will be out on track alone, unfettered by slower machinery from the LMP2 and LMGT3 classes\n\nYet for all the importance of those minutes after the break, you could never know when the quick laps were going to come. Nor definitively say who was on the pole, overall or in class, until three and a bit minutes or so after the clock struck midnight on Thursday. Not great for TV.\n\nEssentially, I was nonplussed on the introduction of Hyperpole five years ago. But I\u2019m more enthusiastic about Hyperpole 2.0. That\u2019s because the Hypercar contenders will be out on track alone, unfettered by slower machinery from the LMP2 and LMGT3 classes. It looks like I\u2019ll never be scrawling \u201ctraffic in the Porsche Curves\u201d, post-qualifying excuse #1, in my notebook again.\n\nAs a purist I liked the old, old system - what existed pre-Hyperpole - but the same rationale is behind my excitement for what is to come at the blue riband round of the World Endurance Championship in June. Qualifying at Le Mans will be more than ever before be about man and machine, the stopwatch and the challenge of the 8.47 miles of the Circuit de la Sarthe - and not the traffic a driver does or does not have to negotiate.\n\nPut simply, it\u2019s purer. Finding that all-important clear lap should be a given for the drivers looking to bask in the glory that comes with pole at Le Mans.\n\nEstre welcomes that the move will mean less traffic for drivers to contend with in their bid for pole Photo by: Marc Fleury\n\nHaving the Hypercars out on their own will \u201cmake it less of a lottery\u201d reckons Porsche driver Kevin Estre, pole winner at Le Mans last year with what I believe was the lap of the WEC season. \u201cIt\u2019s better because it\u2019s fairer\u201d is how he succinctly sums it up.\n\nI don\u2019t disagree, and I hope it has the desired effect in terms of TV viewership: Le Mans and the WEC have to make the most of the amazing product they have right now with so many manufacturers competing in the top class. If it does, then let\u2019s stick with it. All this chopping and changing is no good for anyone.\n\nIMSA had it reasons for abandoning qualifying at the Roar: there was Balance of Performance testing to be done last weekend in the GT Daytona classes for GT3 machinery. But, I reckon, it\u2019s time to stop the tinkering.\n\nQualifying for the opening round of the IMSA SportsCar Championship was not held at the Roar test following more format tweaks Photo by: James Gilbert - Motorsport Images",

More than 7,000 people are headed to Houston to attend the conference with a key question in mind: How to meet increasing demand for power amid the transition to clean energy.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Activist investor Mantle Ridge has won three seats on the board of hydrogen supplier Air Products and Chemicals Inc.\n\nAir Products shareholders voted to elect Mantle Ridge nominees Paul Hilal, Dennis Reilley and Andrew Evans to the company\u2019s board at an annual investor meeting on Thursday, according to a statement that confirmed an earlier Bloomberg News report. Hilal is Mantle Ridge\u2019s founder.\n\nSeifi Ghasemi, Air Products\u2019s chief executive officer, has lost his seat on the board. He remains CEO at the moment.\n\nShares in Air Products were up about 1% at 11:49 a.m. in New York, giving the company a market value of roughly $71 billion. Mantle Ridge has a stake of more than $1 billion investment in Air Products. Reuters reported earlier that Mantle Ridge was set to win the board seats. A spokesperson for Mantle Ridge declined to comment.\n\nPennsylvania-based Air Products earlier this month outlined a succession plan amid its battle with Mantle Ridge. It said at the time that it was \u201ccommitted\u201d to announcing a new president by March 31 and expected to transition to a new CEO within three months of the individual joining.\n\nHilal was previously a senior partner at Pershing Square Capital Management. It was Pershing Square that pressured Air Products to replace its former CEO with Ghasemi in 2014.\n\nAir Products\u2019s shares have risen more than 150% with Ghasemi at the helm, compared to an increase of over 200% in the S&P 500 during the period. Mantle Ridge has been critical of Air Products\u2019s spending under Ghasemi, as well as the company\u2019s succession planning.\n\nThe activist has proposed Eduardo Menezes, a former executive at chemicals company Linde Plc, as a replacement for Ghasemi, and Reilley as a new chairman. Air Products has deemed both candidates to be unqualified.\n\nMajor proxy advisory firms, including Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co., have come out in support of Mantle Ridge candidates.\n\nAir Products\u2019s shareholders on Thursday also voted to elect Tonit Calaway, Lisa Davis, Jessica Trocchi Graziano, Bhavesh Patel, Wayne Smith and Alfred Stern to the company\u2019s board.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the engagement and dialogue we have had with all our shareholders throughout this process and reiterate our commitment to delivering meaningful, long-term value,\u201d Air Products said in a statement.\n\n(Adds details on Mantle Ridge campaign throughout.)\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

So for me it was a clear indication that that was probably not the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cThen basically midway through December we tried to work again on a private deal with ABT and the race program just wasn\u2019t big enough, to be quite honest.\n\n\u201cI think BMW was the right new destination for me. I think to come back to a manufacturer full-time, not be private anymore, is probably in terms of long-term perspective, a good move for me.\n\n\u201cLike I said, I know a lot of the guys from my brother, so it was the easiest transition, I would say. Once we got talking about programs and so on, it looked pretty positive and interesting for me.\u201d\n\nBy moving to BMW, and subsequently joining Team WRT\u2019s LMGT3 effort in WEC, van der Linde exits Lexus at the end of the first year of what he revealed was supposed to be a multi-year commitment to the Japanese manufacturer.\n\n\u201cFrom both sides, it didn\u2019t really materialize in the way that we hoped for,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI expected maybe a different kind of situation before arriving there, probably expected to be a little bit more successful in that time and I just felt that it was really weighing on my motivation.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was willing to to go through that again. Obviously there was no signal of change in the short term and once the BMW offer came up, it was for me quite clear that we needed to pursue that.\n\n\u201cI probably underestimated just the mental challenge of actually filling up the numbers in a field.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve never really had to do or never really was accustomed to and I probably underestimated how difficult that is.\n\n\u201cSo respect to the guys that are still working hard, like a great bunch of people but I just wasn\u2019t up to do it again for another year.\u201d\n\nVan der Linde \u201cWould Love to\u201d Test BMW LMDh Car\n\nWhen BMW announced van der Linde\u2019s signing in December, it outlined that he had done so in a GT3 capacity.\n\nIn that view, the 28-year-old downplayed the odds of stepping up to its LMDh roster, although he expressed a hope of a test outing at the wheel of the M Hybrid V8.\n\n\u201cEvery year of course I have certain hopes of driving,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re so deep into this LMDh era now that there\u2019s certain specialists that are starting to kind of identify themselves.\n\n\u201cSo I think, in general, it becomes more difficult every year for a rookie to come into that thing especially with a manufacturer that has the option of signing experienced guys, right?\n\n\u201cI mean, I would love to. There\u2019s definitely no doors closed in terms of maybe testing the car at some point, but obviously nothing confirmed either.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s purely hope from my side at this moment.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, I feel established in the GT3 scene, feel comfortable there, feel like I can go and win some more races. I have a couple more races on my bucket list.\u201d",

            "content": "During the Roar before the 24 last weekend, BMW M Motorsport drivers and teams intensely prepared for the first season highlight of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC), the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA). One week before the race, three test days featuring seven sessions were held, during which BMW M Team RLL, with its two BMW M Hybrid V8s, gave strong performances. Dries Vanthoor (BEL) set the overall fastest time with 1:35.424 minutes. Kevin Magnussen (DEN) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) used the tests to complete their first laps as BMW M works drivers.\n\nIn the GTP category, BMW M Team RLL carried out an extensive testing program, completing more than 370 laps at the Daytona International Speedway. In the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, Philipp Eng (AUT), Dries Vanthoor, Kevin Magnussen, and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) took turns driving. In car #25, Marco Wittmann (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Robin Frijns (NED), and Ren\u00e9 Rast (GER) shared the cockpit. Three of the sessions ended with a BMW M Hybrid V8 setting the best time. BMW M Motorsport newcomer Magnussen spent a lot of time getting accustomed to the car and team.\n\nIn the GTD-PRO class, Kelvin van der Linde had his premiere at the wheel of the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Paul Miller Racing. He shared driving duties with Madison Snow, Neil Verhagen, and Connor De Phillippi (all USA). In the sister #48 car, Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Augusto Farfus (BRA) were in action. Harper and Hesse missed the first test day due to illness but caught up on their laps without issues later on. In total, the team\u2019s two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs completed around 370 laps. They sported the BMW M Motorsport \u201cInception\u201d design for the first time, which they will sport throughout the season.\n\nIn the GTD class, Turner Motorsport tested its new BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Over the course of the Roar before the 24, the four drivers, Robby Foley, Patrick Gallagher, Jake Walker (all USA), and Jens Klingmann (GER), completed around 150 laps. Starting next Thursday, the Daytona racing action continues with practice and qualifying. The 24-hour race begins on Saturday, 25th January, at 13:40 local time (19:40 CET). All session can be watched live on www.imsa.tv.\n\nPartnership with Champion Ignition enters its second season.\n\nWith the race at Daytona, the partnership between BMW M Motorsport and spark plug manufacturer Champion enters its second season. The Champion logo will continue to be featured on the two BMW M Hybrid V8s of BMW M Team RLL, as it was in 2024. The successful partnership will also continue in the DTM with one of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars featuring the Champion branding. The focus in 2025 is on expanding the collaboration to a technological level. Among other things, both partners are looking to find optimizations for the P66/3 combustion engine used in the hybrid system of the BMW M Hybrid V8, where the ignition system plays a crucial role. On-site, BMW M Motorsport offers employees, customers, and guests of Champion exclusive experiences and provides extraordinary insights into the operations at the racetrack. Both partners also closely coordinate their activation measures and marketing communications.\n\nIn just a few months last season, BMW M Motorsport and Champion celebrated a 1-2 finish for the BMW M Hybrid V8 at Indianapolis (USA), as well as three wins, five podium finishes, and the team title for Schubert Motorsport in the DTM. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be able to continue and even expand our partnership with Champion. We look forward to continuing our successful collaboration in our programs in IMSA and DTM. In 2024, the Champion logo on our cars brought us luck,\u201d said Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH.\n\nComments after the Roar before the 24:\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL): \u201cI\u2019m happy with how the Roar went. It feels good to know that everything is running smoothly and that the car is performing well. But of course, it all counts next weekend. That\u2019s when the winners are crowned, and that\u2019s when we need to be there.\u201d\n\nKevin Magnussen (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL): \u201cWe had a few very productive test days at the Roar. There are many new things for me to learn at BMW M Motorsport, and I feel more comfortable with every lap on the track. This week is the big test where we can show how strong we really are compared to our competitors. I\u2019m really looking forward to it.\n\nMarco Wittmann (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL): \u201cWe can be very satisfied with the sessions at the Roar. We\u2019ve checked many things off our to-do list, so next week we can focus on fine-tuning. The goal is to be well-prepared for the first season highlight and hopefully compete for the podium and the win. Our performance at the Roar was encouraging, but we all know that it really counts in the race.\u201d\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing): \u201cFor me, it was most important to cover as many kilometers as possible in the first few days. Thanks to the support of my teammates, I quickly got used to the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. They really helped me a lot. I feel comfortable in the car and am ready to go full attack at the 24-hour race. We\u2019ll have to see where we stand in terms of performance this week, but the mood in the team is good.\u201d\n\nDan Harper (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing): \u201cMax and I caught some virus after our win at the 24H Dubai and didn\u2019t feel well, so we missed the first day. Our teammates Jesse and Augusto took the opportunity to prepare the setup of the new car. We built on that on the second day, and I think we have a pretty good base. The team is doing a great job, very organised and professional. We definitely have room for improvement in terms of speed on a single lap, but there are still a few practice sessions left.\u201d\n\nJens Klingmann (#96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Turner Motorsport): \u201cOur focus in preparation for the race was clearly on the car\u2019s behavior over the race distance. You don\u2019t win a 24-hour race in the first lap, so we worked on finding a good balance and pace for the long runs. The dress rehearsal of the brand-new BMW M4 GT3 EVO went perfectly. We put the car on the track, and everything worked exactly as it should. We are optimistic that we will have a package this week that can compete for the podium.\u201d\n\nRead the full article here.",

            "content": "A new approach to sustainable travel could take root: two extra days paid time off for employees who choose not to fly for a year. At Sprinklr, an Amsterdam-based organic plant retailer, 11 out of 14 team members earned these 'Linde days' in 2024 \u2014 named after their warehouse manager, who inspired the policy through her own commitment to low-carbon travel.\n\nThe initiative grew from a simple observation: while sustainable options benefit all of society, they often cost individuals extra time and effort. When Linde opted to take an 18-hour bus journey from Amsterdam to the Venice Biennale rather than flying with friends, her climate-aware choice demanded more time and patience. (Meanwhile, a new study by Transport & Environment reveals that \"Europe's aviation industry plans to double its passenger traffic by 2050 and will deplete its carbon budget as early as 2026.\")\n\nRather than running carbon calculations to determine the exact footprint of every trip, Sprinklr focused on supporting its team's conscious travel choices. Offering those two additional leave days acknowledges the extra time required for most train or bus journeys. As co-founder Suzanne van Straaten explains, it's not about judging those who fly but empowering employees who are mindful of how they travel \u2014 a practical approach helping to bridge the gap between people's environmental ideals and their real-world constraints.",

            "content": "As I noted in a previous post, in his story, Deutsches Requiem, Jorge Luis Borges, presented the musings of Otto Dietrich zur Linde, a former concentration camp commandant in his prison cell on the eve of his execution for war crimes. Zur Linde accepts his fate with equanimity, even as a vindication:\n\nAn inexorable epoch is spreading over the world. We forged it, we who are already its victims. What matters . . . so long as violence reigns and not servile Christian timidity? If victory and injustice and happiness are not for Germany, let them be for other nations. Let Heaven exist, even though our dwelling place is in Hell.\n\nThis immediately came to mind when I saw this:\n\nThis as not the sole homage to genocide and white supremacy at President Trump\u2019s inauguration. At the risk of being accused of spreading \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d I will mention some examples.\n\nIn his address, Trump at last started to answer the question, when was America great? He recalled, \u201cAmericans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness.\u201d Far from being an\u201duntamed wilderness,\u201d however, Pre-Columbian North America had a population variously estimated at 3.8 to 18 million people. In the year 1500 there were populations in that range in France, the Ottoman Empire, Japan, Spain, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Muscovy, Vietnam, and Iran. What later generations of European settlers described as \u201cuntamed wilderness\u201d was the deserted habitat of millions who had perished from disease, massacres, forced displacement, and enslavement and other forms of forced labor.\n\nAnd who \u201ctamed\u201d that \u201cwilderness?\u201d According to Trump,\n\nThey were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward and marched forward and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.\n\nOmitted from this account are the enslaved Africans who built, among other things, the White House and the U.S. Capitol building.\n\nTrump portrayed as nativist patriotism his intention to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico, from that of a meso-American civilization, to the Gulf of America, named for a fifteenth century Italian, Amerigo Vespucci.\n\nHe invoked theU.S.\u2019s Manifest Destiny, a doctrine claiming a divine mandate for seizing land from its native inhabitants, killing and displacing them. As part of that destiny, he laid claim to the Panama Canal, where, he said, the United States \u201clost 38,000 lives in the building the Panama Canal.\u201d The workers who died, however, were mostly not citizens of the U.S.: over three quarters were contract workers recruited from the \u201cshithole countries\u201d of the Caribbean. They were the ancestors of the undocumented workers whom Trump now wants to deport and whom he slanders as criminals and asylum inmates.\n\nTrump claimed, \u201cMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier.\u201d The immediate example he gave was that \u201cthe hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.\u201d Neither he, nor any of the clergyman who mentioned the hostages in their benedictions, breathed a word about the ceasefire in Gaza, where Israel\u2019s genocidal offensive killed over 48,000 people and left entire cities of rubble, concealing the corpses of the slain.\n\nTrump noted that his inauguration took place on Martin Luther King Day, which so many of his supporters had opposed honoring as a holiday. He sullied King\u2019s name by claiming that this supremacist program would \u201cmake his dream come true.\u201d And he did all this in the name of a God who supposedly saved Trump\u2019s life for a sacred purpose, but who allowed Dr. King to be assassinated.\n\nOnce again, the greatest crime is silence.",

We're not there to make up the numbers.\"\n\nFeeney, 22, has made four starts in the event, taking 15th outright and a class win in 2020, then third, fifth and sixth outright, all in Mercedes cars, for Triple 8 from 2022-24.\n\n\"It's a great opportunity to get laps before the start of our season at a huge event and one of my favourites,\" said Feeney, who finished second in the 2024 Supercars championship behind team-mate Will Brown.\n\n\"When I spoke with Troy, we were both on the same page and we didn't want to waste time doing it unless we could go there and fight for the win. With the drivers, the team and the car, we have every opportunity to get some great results.\n\n\"It's been super last minute, but they're super confident in their package and I'm excited.\"\n\nIronically, Feeney will be racing against Brown, who will partner Chaz Mostert and Daniel Serra in a Ferrari 296 GT3, as well as fellow Supercars drivers Cam Waters, Thomas Randle and Craig Lowndes in a Mercedes-AMG.\n\nThe entry means that MPC will now field two cars, the Pro entry running alongside a Hallmarc Racing Bronze R8 for Marc Cini, Lee Holdsworth and Dean Fiore.",

In our view, Mr. Seifi Ghasemi is not the right leader to unlock the full potential of Air Products.\" \u2013 Egan-Jones , 1/10/25\n\n\n\n\"The absence of a clear CEO succession plan, along with Mr. Ghasemi's numerous statements regarding his intention to remain as CEO, not only calls into question the integrity of leadership but also poses a significant reputational risk to the company...

Despite Brevis\u2019s struggles in the tournament so far\u2014scoring just 101 runs in five matches at a strike rate of 174 and an average of 20\u2014many believe the youngster should have been given an opportunity to regain his confidence.\n\nFans are now questioning Rashid Khan\u2019s decision to bat ahead of Brevis and whether it cost MI Cape Town valuable momentum in a crucial match. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the reactions:\n\nWhat\u2019s happening with the batting line ups in the @SA20_League ? We\u2019ve seen Stubbs at 7, Klaasen at 7 and now Rashid Khan at 5 ahead of Brevis, Linde and Potgieter. Make it make sense\u2026 \u2014 Grant Nicol (@Grant_za) January 21, 2025\n\nWhy is Rashid Khan batting at 5 lol \u2014 b.. (@finished004) January 21, 2025\n\nDewald Brevis,a very good player of spin, batting at 6/7 is really unacceptable. Sending Colin Ingram, Rashid Khan and sometimes even George Linde before him is just wasting the talent of young Brevis. He isn't a 6/7 batter, he is a 3/4 batter.#BetwaySA20 #SA20 \u2014 thatcricketguy (@AlanMatthew7) January 21, 2025\n\nRashid Khan promoting himself so high up the order reminds me of what Pollard was doing last year for MICT.\n\n\n\nEgo above team. \u2014 wezo (@WezoV2) January 21, 2025\n\nRashid khan batting bhi krlega bowling bhi krlega arrogant human #SA20 \u2014 overbacker (@Tanishqv119) January 21, 2025\n\nMICT are sending Rashid Khan over Dewald Brevis, fuck my life.\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/JnVhkC2jBQ \u2014 .

            "content": "Linde (NASDAQ:LIN) has had a rough three months with its share price down 9.5%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Linde's ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Linde\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Linde is:\n\n16% = US$6.5b \u00f7 US$41b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.16 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nLinde's Earnings Growth And 16% ROE\n\nTo start with, Linde's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 10% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This probably laid the ground for Linde's significant 21% net income growth seen over the past five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Linde's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 9.5% in the same period, which is great to see.\n\nNasdaqGS:LIN Past Earnings Growth January 20th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Linde is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.",

            "content": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Linde ( ). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Linde with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Fast Is Linde Growing?\n\nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. It certainly is nice to see that Linde has managed to grow EPS by 25% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. It was a year of stability for Linde as both revenue and EBIT margins remained have been flat over the past year. While this doesn't ring alarm bells, it may not meet the expectations of growth-minded investors.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\n\nIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free ?\n\nAre Linde Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince Linde has a market capitalisation of US$208b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$407m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.2% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.\n\nIs Linde Worth Keeping An Eye On?\n\nYou can't deny that Linde has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. Before you take the next step you should know about the that we have uncovered.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

In the top GTP class, the #24 BMW M Team RLL M Hybrid V8 will be driven by Philipp Eng, Dries Vanthoor, Kevin Magnussen, and Raffaele Marciello. The #25 car will be driven by Marco Wittman, Sheldon van der Linde, Robin Frijns, and Ren\u00e9 Rast. There are twelve total entries in GTP from Porsche, Cadillac, Acura and Lamborghini, in addition to BMW.\n\nThe pair of BMW M Team RLL M Hybrid V8 cars were on the pace during the Roar test. They were fastest in three of the six practice sessions they participated in and second fastest in two of the others. Dries Vanthoor set the fastest lap time of the event with a 1:35.424 lap, just two-tenths of a second ahead of former BMW works driver Nick Yelloly in the #93 Acura ARX-06. Overall, the BMWs set four of the top ten fastest practice times among all sessions. Of course, we\u2019ve seen before that the M Hybrid V8s are fast in practice but don\u2019t race all that well, but hopefully, they will be able to maintain that pace come race weekend.\n\nIn GTD Pro, Paul Miller Racing has expanded to two M4 GT3 EVO entries for 2025. The #1 car will be driven by Madison Snow, Neil Verhagen, Connor De Phillippi and Kelvin van der Linde at Daytona. De Phillippi is moving to GTD Pro after driving in the GTP class for BMW for the last two seasons. Kelvin van der Linde is the older brother of Sheldon van der Linde and was recently signed as a BMW factory driver. Daytona will be his first race with BMW.\n\nThe #48 Paul Miller Racing GTD Pro entry will be driven by Max Hesse, Dan Harper, Jesse Krohn, and Augusto Farfus. Like De Phillippi, Krohn is being moved to GT cars after a year of driving the GTP prototype. Hesse, Harper, and Verhagen were all part of the BMW Junior program together before being signed as full works drivers. There are fifteen entries among eight manufacturers in GTD Pro.\n\nIn the GTD class, Turner Motorsport will have the sole BMW entry with the #96 M4 GT3 EVO driven by Robby Foley, Patrick Gallagher, Jake Walker, and Jens Klingmann. The GTD class is the most populous of the four classes racing at Daytona, with 22 entries among nine manufacturers.\n\nThe BMWs were not quite up to speed in the GTD Pro and GTD classes. The Paul Miller Racing M4 GT3 EVOs were in the bottom half of the GTD Pro field for most of the sessions, with Kevin van der Linde breaking into the top three fastest times in the fourth session. Overall, the fastest time between the two Paul Miller Racing cars that was set by van der Linde in the #1 was only good enough for eleventh fastest over all the sessions and was around seven-tenths of a second behind the fastest time set by Andrea Caldarelli in a Lamborghini Huracan GT3 EVO2.\n\nIn the GTD class, the Turner Motorsport #96 M4 GT3 EVO set a fast time with Jens Klingmann at the wheel that was only good for the 46th fastest lap among all practice session laps, but that was only around eight-tenths of a second slower than the fastest lap set in GTD by Franck Perera in the #78 Lamborghini. It\u2019s unclear whether IMSA will make any performance adjustments before the race, but we\u2019ve consistently seen that the M4 GT3s perform better in the race than in practice.\n\nIn the Michelin Pilot Challenge series, there are 22 GS class entries among seven manufacturers, including four BMW M4 GT4s. Turner Motorsport will once again have two entries, with the #95 car driven by Francis Selldorff and Dillon Machavern and the #96 car shared by Patrick Gallagher, Vin Barletta, and Matt Dalton. Auto Technic Racing has entered the #27 M4 GT4 EVO for father and son duo Roland and Austin Krainz, along with Stevan McAleer. The CarBahn with Peregrine Racing team led by Steve Dinan has the #39 M4 GT4 entered for Jeff Westphal and Sean McAlister.\n\nAmong the five practice sessions that the Michelin Challenge series held over the Roar test weekend, the BMW M4 GT4s were not at the pace of the fastest cars. Stevan McAleer set the fastest BMW time of the event in the Auto Technic Racing M4 GT4 EVO in the fifth and final session, but it was only good enough for ninth fastest. Ford Mustang GT4s were fastest in three of the five sessions.\n\nNBC Sports will provide extensive coverage of the entire race weekend among the NBC, Peacock, and USA networks, and you can get more information on the schedule at this link. The four-hour Michelin Pilot Challenge race is on Friday, January 24th at 1:40 pm ET. The Rolex 24 starts at 1:30 pm ET on Saturday, the 25th.\n\n\u2014David Haueter\n\n[Photo courtesy LAT IMAGES]",

During the Roar before the 24 last weekend, BMW M Motorsport drivers and teams intensely prepared for the first season highlight of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC), the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA). One week before the race, three test days featuring seven sessions were held, during which BMW M Team RLL with its two BMW M Hybrid V8s gave strong performances. Dries Vanthoor (BEL) set the overall fastest time with 1:35.424 minutes. Kevin Magnussen (DEN) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) used the tests to complete their first laps as BMW M works drivers.\n\nIn the GTP category, BMW M Team RLL carried out an extensive testing programme, completing more than 370 laps at the Daytona International Speedway. In the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, Philipp Eng (AUT), Dries Vanthoor, Kevin Magnussen, and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) took turns driving. In car #25, Marco Wittmann (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Robin Frijns (NED), and Ren\u00e9 Rast (GER) shared the cockpit. Three of the sessions ended with a BMW M Hybrid V8 setting the best time. BMW M Motorsport newcomer Magnussen spent a lot of time getting accustomed to the car and team.\n\nIn the GTD-PRO class, Kelvin van der Linde had his premiere at the wheel of the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Paul Miller Racing. He shared driving duties with Madison Snow, Neil Verhagen, and Connor De Phillippi (all USA). In the sister #48 car, Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Augusto Farfus (BRA) were in action. Harper and Hesse missed the first test day due to illness but caught up on their laps without issues later on. In total, the team\u2019s two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs completed around 370 laps. They sported the BMW M Motorsport \u201cInception\u201d design for the first time, which they will sport throughout the season.\n\nIn the GTD class, Turner Motorsport tested its new BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Over the course of the Roar before the 24, the four drivers Robby Foley, Patrick Gallagher, Jake Walker (all USA), and Jens Klingmann (GER) completed around 150 laps. Starting next Thursday, the Daytona racing action continues with practice and qualifying. The 24-hour race begins on Saturday, 25th January, at 13:40 local time (19:40 CET). All session can be watched live on www.imsa.tv.\n\nPartnership with Champion Ignition enters its second season.\n\nWith the race at Daytona, the partnership between BMW M Motorsport and spark plug manufacturer Champion enters its second season. The Champion logo will continue to be featured on the two BMW M Hybrid V8s of BMW M Team RLL, as it was in 2024. The successful partnership will also continue in the DTM with one of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars featuring the Champion branding. The focus in 2025 is on expanding the collaboration to a technological level. Among other things, both partners are looking to find optimisations for the P66/3 combustion engine used in the hybrid system of the BMW M Hybrid V8, where the ignition system plays a crucial role. On-site, BMW M Motorsport offers employees, customers, and guests of Champion exclusive experiences and provides extraordinary insights into the operations at the racetrack. Both partners also closely coordinate their activation measures and marketing communications.\n\nIn just a few months last season, BMW M Motorsport and Champion celebrated a 1-2 finish for the BMW M Hybrid V8 at Indianapolis (USA), as well as three wins, five podium finishes, and the team title for Schubert Motorsport in the DTM. \u201cIt's great to be able to continue and even expand our partnership with Champion. We look forward to continuing our successful collaboration in our programmes in IMSA and DTM. In 2024, the Champion logo on our cars brought us luck,\u201d said Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH.\n\nComments after the Roar before the 24:\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL): \u201cI'm happy with how the Roar went. It feels good to know that everything is running smoothly and that the car is performing well. But of course, it all counts next weekend. That's when the winners are crowned, and that's when we need to be there.\u201d\n\nKevin Magnussen (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL): \u201cWe had a few very productive test days at the Roar. There are many new things for me to learn at BMW M Motorsport, and I feel more comfortable with every lap on the track. This week is the big test where we can show how strong we really are compared to our competitors. I'm really looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nMarco Wittmann (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL): \u201cWe can be very satisfied with the sessions at the Roar. We've checked many things off our to-do list, so next week we can focus on fine-tuning. The goal is to be well-prepared for the first season highlight and hopefully compete for the podium and the win. Our performance at the Roar was encouraging, but we all know that it really counts in the race.\u201d\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing): \u201cFor me, it was most important to cover as many kilometres as possible in the first few days. Thanks to the support of my teammates, I quickly got used to the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. They really helped me a lot. I feel comfortable in the car and am ready to go full attack at the 24-hour race. We'll have to see where we stand in terms of performance this week, but the mood in the team is good.\u201d\n\nDan Harper (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing): \u201cMax and I caught some virus after our win at the 24H Dubai and didn't feel well, so we missed the first day. Our teammates Jesse and Augusto took the opportunity to prepare the setup of the new car. We built on that on the second day, and I think we have a pretty good base. The team is doing a great job, very organised and professional. We definitely have room for improvement in terms of speed on a single lap, but there are still a few practice sessions left.\u201d\n\nJens Klingmann (#96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Turner Motorsport): \u201cOur focus in preparation for the race was clearly on the car's behaviour over the race distance. You don't win a 24-hour race in the first lap, so we worked on finding a good balance and pace for the long runs. The dress rehearsal of the brand-new BMW M4 GT3 EVO went perfectly. We put the car on the track, and everything worked exactly as it should. We are optimistic that we will have a package this week that can compete for the podium.\u201d",

That\u2019s exactly what you want \u2013 a player who comes in and shoots the lights out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m under no illusions about the quality of George Linde. His chances will depend on the balance we\u2019re looking for in the team. It often happens that our all-rounders have the same kind of skills.\n\n\u201cObviously we have Kesh [Maharaj] as our left-arm spinner, and Bjorn [Fortuin] who has also done very well recently. Then Shammo [left-arm spinner Tabraiz Shamsi] is also there, of course. It all counted against George, but against Pakistan could we give him a chance in the T20s.\n\n\u201cIn one-day cricket it\u2019s difficult because we have Kesh,\u201d Walter added. \u201cBut who knows, if we get an injury, it might create an opportunity for George again.\n\nALSO: Nortje injured again\n\n\u201cThings can change quickly; this season we\u2019ve had seven fast bowlers injured, and it creates opportunities. Our aim is to build an enlarged group that can compete on the international stage.\u201d\n\nFull story\n\nPhoto: Darren Stewart/Gallo Images",

We\u2019ve got a lot of new engineers, some from Cadillac, for example, as well, which definitely helps.\u201d\n\n***Van der Linde declined to comment on the identity of the new engineers when asked by Sportscar365.\n\n***IMSA practiced its new-for-2025 GTD Pro and GTD class split in the day\u2019s first session with a simulated yellow flag scenario, followed by the category and class divisions. The new rules will divide GTD Pro and GTD cars similarly to the already existing GTP and LMP2 class divisions that occur on restarts. All 61 cars in the field were requested by IMSA to participate.\n\n***GTD class competitor and DXDT Racing driver Alec Udell told Sportscar365: \u201cIt\u2019s similar to what we\u2019ve done in this series in the past. The only thing that changes now is when you\u2019re listening to the engineer, there\u2019s a designation between the category split and class split. Ultimately, it is probably a nice thing from a sporting side because you get to be around the cars you\u2019re racing, and you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re being picked by another car for some reason.\u201d\n\n***Corvette Racing by Pratt Miller Motorsports\u2019 Nico Varrone added: \u201cIt was really smooth. I think everyone understands the process already from the one before so it was really easy to do. Hopefully, for the fans, it will bring more excitement and more close racing between classes, which I think will be better. It was really smooth and really clear for everyone.\u201d\n\n***Porsche Penske Motorsport replaced the battery and MGU on its No. 7 Porsche 963 following yesterday\u2019s \u2018red alarm\u2019 that forced Felipe Nasr to abandon the car on the backstretch during the second session. The car returned to action without any reported issues on Saturday morning.\n\n***It\u2019s been revealed that two other 963s also encountered high voltage-related issues on Friday. The No. 5 Proton Competition Porsche changed its battery in the morning, missing most of the first session, while the No. 85 JDC-Miller Motorsports lost time in the afternoon session with an undisclosed HV problem.\n\n***Joey Hand has been reunited with his 1999 Star Mazda series championship-winning car chief Kyle Hall, who serves as crew chief on the No. 66 Gradient Racing Ford Mustang GT3.\n\n***Hand, who remains a factory Ford Performance driver, told Sportscar365 that he\u2019s currently confirmed at Gradient for the five Michelin Endurance Cup races only. \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about it but for now it\u2019s the ones we have three drivers,\u201d he said.\n\n***Fellow Ford ace Harry Tincknell, meanwhile, indicated that the Rolex 24 could be his only WeatherTech Championship outing this year, with the Multimatic-contracted driver set to focus on his FIA World Endurance Championship duties with Heart of Racing Team\u2019s Aston Martin Valkyrie AMR-LMH in the Hypercar class.\n\n***Tincknell told Sportscar365: \u201cI would say right now there are no plans for any more, but I am super happy to be back. I was sad not to be doing the long races here, so when the call came to do Daytona I was really excited. The primary focus will be on WEC.\u201d\n\n***While yet to be announced, Sportscar365 believes that Ross Gunn and Roman De Angelis will be the season-long co-drivers in Heart of Racing\u2019s solo Valkyrie GTP entry in the WeatherTech Championship, which is slated to debut in the next round at Sebring.\n\n***Four-time IMSA champion Dane Cameron said he\u2019s felt a huge weight off his shoulders returning to Daytona International Speedway after winning his first Rolex 24, with Porsche Penske Motorsport. The 36-year-old is with AO Racing in the LMP2 ranks this year.\n\n***Cameron said: \u201cIt\u2019s nice go to back to Daytona with the weight off the shoulders, for sure. That was always tough to go there every year with a lot of expectation and pressure from myself to try and get that one done. It\u2019s nice to go there without that for once!\u201d\n\n***Era Motorsport\u2019s Oreca 07 Gibson LMP2 car has been coined the \u2018programmers\u2019 car, with Ruby on Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson joined by colleague Tobias Lutke, the co-founder and CEO of Shopify, who uses Heinemeier Hansson\u2019s platform to power the popular e-commerce company.\n\n***DHH told Sportscar365: \u201cTobi built Shopify on Rails by himself in the early days and was even on the Rails core team, and has been an amazing supporter of Ruby on Rails ever since. I\u2019ve known him for 20 years and then he just started getting into racing a few years ago, first doing iRacing, and doing some club stuff and Radicals, moving onto LMP3s.\u201d\n\n***It\u2019s understood that Lutke, the team\u2019s designated Bronze-rated driver, will be in for all of LMP2 races this season except Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, where he has a clashing business commitment. Lutke has outlined his ambition of taking part in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the future.\n\n***With his first outing as a factory driver for BMW, Kevin Magnussen follows in the footsteps of his father Jan in representing the Bavarian brand on an international stage. Although the elder Magnussen is largely known for his lengthy and successful tenure with Corvette Racing, he joined BMW for the FIA World Touring Car Championship round at Macau in 2006.\n\n***AO Racing is \u201cinvestigating options\u201d to have \u2018Rexy\u2019 on the GTD grid in the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach according to team principal Gunnar Jeannette. The first sprint round of the WeatherTech Championship season will again not feature the GTD Pro class, leaving the option open for the team to potentially enter its Porsche 911 GT3 R for the 100-minute race.\n\n***Sportscar365 understands that Laurens Vanthoor could be in contention for the ride, alongside Bronze-rated team owner PJ Hyett.\n\n***Van der Steur Racing, which is making its GTD class debut as part of a Michelin Endurance Cup effort this year, has purchased both of Elias Sabo\u2019s Aston Martin Vantage GT3 EVOs that ran in SRO America competition in 2024. The Flying Lizard Motorsports driver made the mid-season switch to BMW machinery.\n\n***The team is receiving support from Prodrive this weekend.\n\n***While Luis Perez Companc is set to pilot an Oreca in this year\u2019s Rolex 24, his son Matias is making his GT3 debut aboard an AF Corse Ferrari 296 GT3 in the VP Racing SportsCar Challenge. He steps up after competing in Ferrari Challenge North America last year.\n\n***The chassis in use for Trackhouse by TF Sport\u2019s GTD Pro entry is the same car that will contest the European Le Mans Series later this year, team principal Tom Ferrier told Sportscar365. The two WEC cars, meanwhile, are currently in Dubai, where the team will conduct a shakedown test in the days immediately following the Daytona race.\n\n***United Autosports\u2019 pair of Orecas are both carrying a tribute decal to commemorate Ian Barnwell. The logistics specialist passed away in December after a short illness.\n\nDavey Euwema & Jonathan Grace contributed to this report",

They are undefeated in the competition so far.\n\nJoburg Super Kings will take on MI Cape Town in match No. 13, which will be played at the Newlands Stadium, Cape Town. The Super Kings will feel themselves lucky that the last game was washed out when they were 138/8 in 20 overs against Pretoria Capitals.\n\nThey got a chance to rebuild their batting strategy and come again with a plan. Meanwhile, MICT have two wins and two defeats, and they are also fighting for the top spot.\n\nMICT vs JSK: Match Details\n\nMatch: MI Cape Town (MICT) vs Joburg Super Kings (JSK), Match 13, SA20 League 2025\n\nMatch Date: January 18, 2025 (Saturday)\n\nTime: 9 PM IST / 03:30 PM GMT / 05:30 PM LOCAL\n\nVenue: Newlands, Cape Town\n\nMICT vs JSK: Head-to-Head: MICT (2) \u2013 JSK (3)\n\nThe upcoming clash is the sixth encounter between these two teams in the SA20.

            "content": "Advertisement\n\nKey Insights\n\nThe considerable ownership by public companies in Linde India indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy\n\n75% of the company is held by a single shareholder (Linde plc)\n\nUsing data from alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company\n\nA look at the shareholders of Linde India Limited ( ) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 75% to be precise, is public companies. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nAnd following last week's 8.8% decline in share price, public companies suffered the most losses.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Linde India.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Linde India?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nLinde India already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Linde India's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nLinde India is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Linde plc, with ownership of 75%. With such a huge stake in the ownership, we infer that they have significant control of the future of the company. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 2.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 2.0% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There is some analyst coverage of the stock, but it could still become more well known, with time.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Linde India\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Linde India Limited. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth \u20b915b. Most would see this as a real positive. It is good to see this level of investment by insiders. You can\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Linde India. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nPublic Company Ownership\n\nPublic companies currently own 75% of Linde India stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\n\nMany find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past. You can access .\n\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

During the Roar before the 24 last weekend, BMW M Motorsport drivers and teams intensely prepared for the first season highlight of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC), the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA). One week before the race, three test days featuring seven sessions were held, during which BMW M Team RLL with its two BMW M Hybrid V8s gave strong performances. Dries Vanthoor (BEL) set the overall fastest time with 1:35.424 minutes. Kevin Magnussen (DEN) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) used the tests to complete their first laps as BMW M works drivers.\n\nIn the GTP category, BMW M Team RLL carried out an extensive testing programme, completing more than 370 laps at the Daytona International Speedway. In the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, Philipp Eng (AUT), Dries Vanthoor, Kevin Magnussen, and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) took turns driving. In car #25, Marco Wittmann (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Robin Frijns (NED), and Ren\u00e9 Rast (GER) shared the cockpit. Three of the sessions ended with a BMW M Hybrid V8 setting the best time. BMW M Motorsport newcomer Magnussen spent a lot of time getting accustomed to the car and team.\n\nIn the GTD-PRO class, Kelvin van der Linde had his premiere at the wheel of the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Paul Miller Racing. He shared driving duties with Madison Snow, Neil Verhagen, and Connor De Phillippi (all USA). In the sister #48 car, Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Augusto Farfus (BRA) were in action. Harper and Hesse missed the first test day due to illness but caught up on their laps without issues later on. In total, the team\u2019s two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs completed around 370 laps. They sported the BMW M Motorsport \u201cInception\u201d design for the first time, which they will sport throughout the season.\n\nIn the GTD class, Turner Motorsport tested its new BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Over the course of the Roar before the 24, the four drivers Robby Foley, Patrick Gallagher, Jake Walker (all USA), and Jens Klingmann (GER) completed around 150 laps. Starting next Thursday, the Daytona racing action continues with practice and qualifying. The 24-hour race begins on Saturday, 25th January, at 13:40 local time (19:40 CET). All session can be watched live on www.imsa.tv.\n\nPartnership with Champion Ignition enters its second season.\n\nWith the race at Daytona, the partnership between BMW M Motorsport and spark plug manufacturer Champion enters its second season. The Champion logo will continue to be featured on the two BMW M Hybrid V8s of BMW M Team RLL, as it was in 2024. The successful partnership will also continue in the DTM with one of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars featuring the Champion branding. The focus in 2025 is on expanding the collaboration to a technological level. Among other things, both partners are looking to find optimisations for the P66/3 combustion engine used in the hybrid system of the BMW M Hybrid V8, where the ignition system plays a crucial role. On-site, BMW M Motorsport offers employees, customers, and guests of Champion exclusive experiences and provides extraordinary insights into the operations at the racetrack. Both partners also closely coordinate their activation measures and marketing communications.\n\nIn just a few months last season, BMW M Motorsport and Champion celebrated a 1-2 finish for the BMW M Hybrid V8 at Indianapolis (USA), as well as three wins, five podium finishes, and the team title for Schubert Motorsport in the DTM. \u201cIt's great to be able to continue and even expand our partnership with Champion. We look forward to continuing our successful collaboration in our programmes in IMSA and DTM. In 2024, the Champion logo on our cars brought us luck,\u201d said Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH.\n\nComments after the Roar before the 24:\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL): \u201cI'm happy with how the Roar went. It feels good to know that everything is running smoothly and that the car is performing well. But of course, it all counts next weekend. That's when the winners are crowned, and that's when we need to be there.\u201d\n\nKevin Magnussen (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL): \u201cWe had a few very productive test days at the Roar. There are many new things for me to learn at BMW M Motorsport, and I feel more comfortable with every lap on the track. This week is the big test where we can show how strong we really are compared to our competitors. I'm really looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nMarco Wittmann (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL): \u201cWe can be very satisfied with the sessions at the Roar. We've checked many things off our to-do list, so next week we can focus on fine-tuning. The goal is to be well-prepared for the first season highlight and hopefully compete for the podium and the win. Our performance at the Roar was encouraging, but we all know that it really counts in the race.\u201d\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing): \u201cFor me, it was most important to cover as many kilometres as possible in the first few days. Thanks to the support of my teammates, I quickly got used to the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. They really helped me a lot. I feel comfortable in the car and am ready to go full attack at the 24-hour race. We'll have to see where we stand in terms of performance this week, but the mood in the team is good.\u201d\n\nDan Harper (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing): \u201cMax and I caught some virus after our win at the 24H Dubai and didn't feel well, so we missed the first day. Our teammates Jesse and Augusto took the opportunity to prepare the setup of the new car. We built on that on the second day, and I think we have a pretty good base. The team is doing a great job, very organised and professional. We definitely have room for improvement in terms of speed on a single lap, but there are still a few practice sessions left.\u201d\n\nJens Klingmann (#96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Turner Motorsport): \u201cOur focus in preparation for the race was clearly on the car's behaviour over the race distance. You don't win a 24-hour race in the first lap, so we worked on finding a good balance and pace for the long runs. The dress rehearsal of the brand-new BMW M4 GT3 EVO went perfectly. We put the car on the track, and everything worked exactly as it should. We are optimistic that we will have a package this week that can compete for the podium.\u201d",

This award will be used to construct and operate a hydrogen fueling station for heavy-duty trucks. (Photo courtesy of Linde)\n\nHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) announced on January 10th that the agency awarded nearly $25 million in grant funding to the Port of Houston Authority (Port Houston) as part of a public-private collaboration between Port Houston and Linde Inc. (Linde), a leading industrial gases company, with additional partners GTI Energy, Argonne National Laboratory, and Center for Houston\u2019s Future. This award will be used to construct and operate a hydrogen fueling station for heavy-duty trucks.\n\nThe project, Bayport HRS, will result in an innovative pipeline-based Hydrogen Refueling Station (HRS), which will offer high fueling throughput with convenient and publicly accessible fueling options, further enabling supply chain development in Texas and the Gulf-Coast region. Linde will design, construct, own and operate the new facility, creating a cost-effective heavy-duty (HD) truck hydrogen fueling station in Bayport, Texas.\n\nThis project will be a coordinated public-private collaboration between the public agency leading the most important and busiest port in the United States (Port Houston), a major industrial leader in HRS and hydrogen supply (Linde), a worldwide leader in energy innovation (GTI Energy), a non-profit with extensive experience in energy transition in Houston (Center for Houston\u2019s Future, CHF), and a global leader in modeling hydrogen delivery infrastructure (Argonne National Laboratory, ANL).\n\nThe project supports the Port\u2019s Sustainability Action Plan and ambitious goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. It also aligns with national strategies for transportation decarbonization and clean hydrogen.\n\n\u201cThe Houston Ship Channel is the busiest waterway in the nation,\u201d said Port Houston CEO Charlie Jenkins. \u201cAs one of the channel\u2019s leading advocates, Port Houston is committed to fostering sustainability, resilience, collaboration, and quality of life for the community and nation we serve.\u201d\n\n\u201cPartnering with Linde, one of the largest hydrogen producers in the world and owner of a major pipeline complex that serves the Houston region, is in line with the Port\u2019s strategy of engaging the Houston Ship Channel industry on projects that benefit the community, promote sustainability, decarbonization, and clean transportation,\u201d said Port Houston Chief Infrastructure Officer Rich Byrnes. \u201cThis project exemplifies Port Houston \u2018walking the talk\u2019 of sustainability and Net Zero. Port Houston\u2019s sustainability roadmap and grants strategy is about accelerating and de-risking business decisions supporting decarbonization and energy transition.\u201d\n\n\u201cLinde looks forward to working with Port Houston to develop key hydrogen infrastructure to support the future decarbonization of heavy transport in Texas,\u201d said Richard Minter, President, Hydrogen Mobility. \u201cWe look forward to working with our partners, contributing Linde\u2019s extensive experience and network of hydrogen production assets.\u201d\n\n\"The Houston/Gulf Coast's regional clean hydrogen economy continues to gain momentum, including with announcements such as this,\u201d said Brett Perlman, managing director at the Center for Houston's Future. \"We are excited to be part of this important work to build out a clean hydrogen transportation network. This is also another great example of collaboration among business, government and community to get things done.\"\n\n\u201cHydrogen has tremendous potential to reduce emissions in hard-to-abate sectors like heavy-duty trucking,\u201d said Kristine Wiley, Vice President, Low Carbon Energy Solutions, GTI Energy. \u201cThe Bayport HRS project demonstrates how collaboration and innovative infrastructure can accelerate hydrogen\u2019s integration into a low-cost, low-carbon future. We look forward to contributing to this project, leveraging the Houston area\u2019s energy resources to drive tangible progress in decarbonization, energy security, and economic resilience.\u201d\n\nA goal of the collaboration is to support the U.S. National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonization, the National Zero-Emission Freight Corridor Strategy, and U.S. National Clean H2 Strategy and Roadmap.\n\nLast year, the Port\u2019s grants team secured nearly $57M in grant funding further supporting the Port\u2019s sustainability plan to lead, partner with others, or support to produce tangible results.\n\n\u201cWith this $25 million grant award, Port Houston\u2019s highly effective grants program is off to a strong start in 2025,\u201d Jenkins concluded.\n\nAbout Port Houston\n\nFor more than 100 years, Port Houston has owned and operated the public wharves and terminals along the Houston Ship Channel, including the area\u2019s largest breakbulk facility and two of the most efficient container terminals in the country. Port Houston is the advocate and a strategic leader for the Channel. The Houston Ship Channel complex and its more than 200 private and eight public terminals is the nation\u2019s largest port for waterborne tonnage and an essential economic engine for the Houston region, the state of Texas and the U.S. The Port of Houston supports the creation of nearly 1.5 million jobs in Texas and 3.37 million jobs nationwide, and economic activity totaling $439 billion in Texas and $906 billion in economic impact across the nation.

            "content": "After Ryan Rickleton and Donovan Ferreira, who could be next SA20 stars that make their way into the IPL? We take a look at five potential candidates.\n\nA few years back a renowned name in cricket broadcasting said the talent pool in South Africa is declining. Time has proven that statement completely false as the SA20 keeps producing newer stars.\n\nThe league, which was introduced to give a bigger platform for South African players, has already made the likes of Tristan Stubbs, Dewald Brevis, Ryan Rickleton, Donovan Ferreira, and Ottneil Baartman bigger stars than they were.\n\nWhile Stubbs and Brevis were picked up by Mumbai Indians before the SA20, Ferreira grabbed eyeballs and secured a contract with Rajasthan Royals on the back of his SA20 debut. Rickleton had a blockbuster season last year for MI Cape Town, where he compiled 530 runs at an average of 58.88 and strike rate of 173.77. He was picked up by Mumbai Indians and is likely to get opportunities in the IPL 2025.\n\nALSO READ: Key Bowler\u2019s Horrible Form in SA20 2025 Spells Big Headache for CSK Ahead of IPL 2025\n\nThe 2025 edition of the SA20 has gotten off to a blistering start, unearthing more promising names from the rainbow nation. Without further ado, let\u2019s talk about five SA20 stars that could secure IPL deals soon.\n\nDelano Potgieter\n\nMI Cape Town\u2019s latest sensation Delano Potgieter has the kind of player profile that makes IPL franchises break their banks. A hard-hitting batter who can bat anywhere and a seam bowler with a pretty good pace, it\u2019s a perfect combination. Potgieter didn\u2019t get many opportunities in the first two SA20 editions, though he did show glimpses of his potential. This season, however, he has had a dream start. He struck 25* off 12 and claimed a five-for in the season opener. He then blasted 44* off 22 and 29 off 18 in the following two outings. If he keeps up this form, it won\u2019t be long until we see him lighting up the IPL.\n\nLhuan-dre Pretorius\n\nThe 19-year old left-hand batter has taken the SA20 by storm with dazzling performances for Paarl Royals. Lhuan-dre Pretorius sits at the top of the batting charts with 206 runs from three innings at a strike rate of 179. South Africa\u2019s star in the Under-19 World Cup, hit 97 off 51 on his SA20 debut against Sunrisers Eastern Cape and struck 83 off 52 versus MI Cape Town. With clean ball-striking, wicketkeeping option and age on his side, Lhuan-dre Pretorius could attract IPL franchises in near future.\n\nThe Paarl Royals openers had a bit of fun setting the platform \ud83c\udfcf #BetwaySA20 #PRvMICT #WelcomeToIncredible pic.twitter.com/Pxa6yraoJM \u2014 Betway SA20 (@SA20_League) January 15, 2025\n\nGeorge Linde\n\nGeorge Linde might be 33 years old but he is at the peak of his career. The left-arm orthodox spinner with an ability to hit the ball long, Linde has the skill set to attract T20 leagues around the world. IPL generally hasn\u2019t been a great place for overseas spinners but Linde can bat anywhere. In the ongoing SA20, he smashed 48 not-out off 33 to rescue MI Cape Town from 30/4. Recently, he struck 48 off 24 and picked 4 for 21 against Pakistan.\n\nLeus du Plooy\n\nAlthough currently eligible to be an England player, Leus du Plooy has spent most of his early cricketing career in South Africa. The elegant left-hand batter has made a name for himself through SA20, with a sensational record for Joburg Super Kings. Du Plooy has made 688 runs in the league at an impressive average of 45.86 while striking at 145.45. Adaptability in the middle order and a good range against pace and spin makes him an attractive prospect.\n\nALSO READ: South Africa and KKR Speedster Ruled Out of Champions Trophy 2025 With Back Injury\n\nMatthew Breetzke\n\nThe 26-year old batter, who plays for Durban\u2019s Super Giants, has all the potential in the world to be a T20 superstar around the globe. Having a very attacking mindset, Matthew Breetzke has the skill set to take on any bowler and possesses good temperament. Breetzke had an outstanding SA20 season last year, being the third highest run-getter with 416 runs at 32 average and 135 strike rate. He started this season well with 33 off 20 against Pretoria Capitals.",

Root\u2019s brilliant delivery resulted in the dismissal of MI Cape Town\u2019s George Linde.\n\nJoe Root\u2019s brilliant delivery\n\nThe 16th over of MI Cape Town\u2019s innings saw Root produce an exceptional delivery. With Linde at the crease, Root produced a round-arm ball that took everyone by surprise. Linde, attempting a slog-sweep, misjudged the bounce of the ball. The white leather sneaked under his bat and uprooted his off-stump, sending him back to the pavilion for 10 runs off 10 balls. Linde\u2019s departure left MI Cape Town at 4 wickets down.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nAlthough Root\u2019s performance with the bat in this match was brief, as in the 6th over of the Paarl Royals innings, Root faced New Zealand pacer Trent Boult. On the penultimate ball of the powerplay, Root went for an expansive shot but was caught by Ingram at mid-wicket. The ball, bowled at 125 km/h, found Root\u2019s edge as he hacked across the line. Root departed for 15 runs off 15 balls, with 2 boundaries to his name.\n\nPaarl Royals chase down the target\n\nBatting first, MI Cape Town posted a total of 158/4 in their 20 overs. The innings was anchored by Rassie van der Dussen, who played a masterful knock of 91 runs off 64 balls.

            "content": "Aramco has signed a shareholders\u2019 agreement with Linde and SLB to develop Phase 1 of a carbon capture and storage (CCS) hub in Jubail Industrial City in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Eastern Province. This facility as the potential to become one of the largest CCS hubs in the world.\n\nThe project complements Aramco\u2019s blue hydrogen and ammonia programs and supports the company\u2019s ambition to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions across its wholly owned operated assets by 2050 and to reach its interim target of reducing upstream carbon intensity by 15% by 2035, the company said in a press release in December.\n\n\u201cCCS plays a critical role in furthering our sustainability ambitions and our new energies business,\u201d Ashraf Al Ghazzawi, Aramco executive vice president of strategy and corporate development, said in a news release. \u201cThis announcement represents a step forward in delivering on our strategy to contribute to global carbon management solutions and achieve our emission mitigation goals.\u201d\n\nFast Track to Phase 1\n\nAramco expects to complete Phase 1 of the project by 2027 to store up to 9 mtpa of CO 2. Of this, 6 mtpa will be allocated to Aramco's operations, while 3 mtpa will be designated for non-Aramco facilities. The captured CO 2 will be transported via a pipeline network and stored underground in a saline aquifer sink, according to Aramco.\n\nIn addition to the 6 mtpa of CO 2 storage to be developed at Jubail for its own facilities, Aramco plans to continue developing CCS to store an additional 8 mtpa by 2035, according to its 2023 sustainability report. Locations were not provided.\n\nThe shareholders\u2019 agreement between Aramco, Linde, and SLB sets up a collaborative framework for developing the project by outlining ownership stakes, governance structures, financial commitments, and strategic objectives.\n\nUnder its terms, Aramco will hold a 60% equity interest in the hub and be responsible for overall project management and strategy, providing CO 2 from gas processing and industrial sources, overseeing construction of infrastructure including pipelines to transport carbon to storage sites, and ensuring local regulatory compliance.\n\nLinde and SLB will each own 20% stakes with expectations as follows:\n\n\n\nLinde will provide expertise in carbon capture technologies, specifically those applied to industrial processes; deliver engineering support for design and implementation of CCS systems, and act operationally across the life cycle of technologies used.\n\n\n\nSLB will bring its technological capabilities in energy solutions, focusing on enhancing efficiency in CCS processes; implementing digital technologies to optimize emissions measurement, reporting, and verification within the CCS framework; and providing project support, leveraging its experience in large-scale energy projects.\n\n\u201cAramco\u2019s collaboration with SLB and Linde demonstrates the importance of global partnerships in driving technological innovation, reducing emissions from conventional energy sources and enabling new, lower-carbon energy solutions,\u201d Al Ghazzawi said. \u201cThis CCS hub is among several programs that will enable us to meet rising demand for affordable, reliable, and more sustainable energy.\u201d\n\nSLB announced in September 2024 that it had signed an agreement with Aramco to collaborate in developing a digital platform to enable hard-to-abate industrial sectors to collect, measure, report, and verify emissions while evaluating decarbonization options.\n\nStartup To Trial CO 2 Capture Tech\n\nCarbon Clean, a startup headquartered in the UK, reported it had signed an agreement with two of its investors, Aramco and Samsung E&A, to demonstrate its modular CycloneCC carbon capture technology which it developed to capture CO 2 from natural gas turbine exhaust streams containing as little as 4% CO 2 .\n\nThe trial will take place at one of the gas plants participating in Aramco\u2019s CCS project and will enable Carbon Clean to test its claims related to the unit, which it said has a reduced footprint and lower cost when compared to existing carbon capture systems, according to a Carbon Clean news release of 4 December.\n\nSamsung E&A will install the unit on the sales gas compressor turbine exhaust stack to provide performance data under real-world conditions, the release noted.",

The expected humidity is likely to be around 55 percent.\n\nPR vs MICT: Pitch Report\n\nThe surface at Boland Park is good for batting. It is not a big ground, which makes it hard for the bowlers to contain the batters. Early on, bowlers might get some assistance when the ball is new, but as the ball gets soft, it will become easier to bat on.

Increasing adoption of LPG as a domestic fuel in emerging economies of Asia-Pacific, such as India and China, where it is one of the largest imported commodities, and the means of government subsidies will remain a key driving factor for the growing demand for butane.\n\nAccording to the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS), the global import of butanes was 41.52 million metric tons in 2023. The top importers of liquefied butanes were India, China, Indonesia, the European Union, and Morocco.\n\nIn Egypt, the government supplied around 3.6 million tons of butane gas, and Petrogas filled 310 million cylinders through 49 filling stations in fiscal year (FY) 2023/24. The government company Petrogas has 3,067 distribution centers.\n\nIncreasing demand from the construction industry\n\n\n\nThe construction and building industry worldwide is showing a significant pace of growth and development. One of the primary reasons for this industry's expansion is the growing global urbanization. This includes constructing parks, hospitals, hotels, restaurants, houses, buildings, etc., for a large urban population.\n\n\n\nA construction site has several uses for energy, including cutting, welding, roofing, and drying. To carry out the tasks, reliable fuel is essential. This can be a mixture of hydrocarbons such as propane and butane, LPG, a popular fuel.\n\n\n\nBesides the increase in the construction industry, according to Eurostat, in the European Union, building construction increased by 1.1% compared from 2022 to 2023, and civil engineering increased by 4.1%. Countries with significant increases are Romania, Poland, and Belgium, which are the top countries showing considerable growth in the region. This increase in the construction industry indicates an overall increase in raw materials for inputs, including the butane market.\n\n\n\nButane market geographical outlook\n\n\n\nBy geography, the butane market is segmented into North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia-Pacific. The major economies like China, Japan, India, and South Korea dominate the Asia-Pacific region. Some of the fastest-growing emerging economies are from this region, such as ASEAN countries.\n\n\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region is expected to see notable growth in the butane market due to its increasing demand for household consumption.\n\n\n\nIn India, LPG refers to both liquefied propane and butane or mixtures. The number of LPG connections has grown significantly, from 14.52 crore in 2014 to over 32.73 crore as of August 1, 2024, including 10.33 crore PMUY connections. This increasing demand for household consumption will increase the need for butane in the country.\n\n\n\nNorth America is expected to have a significant market share for butane products. The major applications of butane are in different industries, especially in the United States, such as aerosols, foam extrusion, packaging, cabinet heaters, etc.\n\n\n\nReport Coverage:",

            "content": "In March 2020, Frank van der Linde entered the immigration line for European Union citizens at Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol international airport. Linde, a Dutch citizen and human rights advocate, was returning home from outside the EU, and the immigration officer asked him a series of questions about his trip. Linde thought it was a random check; after a few minutes, he was cleared for entry. But unbeknownst to Linde, his answers were recorded and shared with a Dutch public prosecutor, who was collecting information on Linde\u2019s movements.\n\nThe officer had been tipped off about Linde\u2019s arrival that day through a seemingly innocuous action that occurs whenever you board a flight to the United States, much of Europe, and increasingly anywhere in the world\u2014the exchange of detailed personal data about each traveler between airlines and governments. The data, which is retained about you for years, is increasingly valuable for technology companies that are experimenting with using algorithms that could decide who is allowed to cross international borders.\n\nLinde, who is publicly outspoken about homeless rights, anti-racism, and pacifism, was first secretly flagged by Dutch police in 2017 as a person of interest under an Amsterdam municipality counter-terrorism program. In July 2018, Linde had a \u201cweird feeling\u201d that he was being monitored; he would eventually sue the government over 250 times under freedom of information laws to uncover the extent of the surveillance. Although Linde was removed in 2019 from the city\u2019s watchlist, later receiving a personal apology from the mayor of Amsterdam, the scrutiny continued. When Linde learned that the police had put his name on an international travel alert, he wondered if they were also using his travel data to track him.\n\nIn October 2022, Linde requested his flight records from the government. The data, called a Passenger Name Record (PNR), is a digital trail of information related to an airline ticket purchase. PNR records are sent by most commercial airlines to the destination country some 48 to 72 hours before departure. While PNR records might seem innocuous, they contain highly sensitive personal information, including the traveler\u2019s address, cell phone number, date of flight booking, where the ticket was purchased, credit card and other payment information, billing address, baggage information, frequent flyer information, general remarks related to the passenger, date of intended travel, complete travel itinerary, names of accompanying travelers, travel agency information, historical changes to the ticket, and more.\n\nIn December 2022, over two years after Linde passed through Schiphol, the Dutch PNR office, called a Passenger Information Unit, handed over 17 travel records to Linde. They stated that they had not shared his data with others, but Linde was suspicious. He swiftly filed an appeal. In March 2023, the Dutch government admitted that in fact they had shared Linde\u2019s PNR details three times with the border police, including ahead of the March 2020 flight, when the immigration officer was instructed to covertly extract information. (They also shared an additional seven flight records that they claimed to have only discovered on a second search.)\n\nAs Linde reviewed his PNR records, he was surprised to find that some of the travel data the government had on him was incorrect\u2014some flights were missing, and in four cases, the government had records of flights he never took. For example, one PNR record from 2021 stated Linde traveled to Belfast, Northern Ireland; Linde says he had reserved the ticket, but changed his plans and never boarded the plane. \u201cWhat do companies do with the data?\u201d Linde asked as he scrolled through copies of the PNR records on his laptop. \u201cIf commercial companies help to analyze data that\u2019s incorrect, you could draw all kinds of conclusions.\u201d",

The allrounder missed the team bus ahead of the first T20I against Pakistan at Kingsmead and had to be escorted alone by a whole security cordon. Linde felt a stab of embarrassment for burdening others because of his mistake.\n\nHe quickly compensated for his goof-up in a matter of few hours by slamming 48 off 24 balls with the bat and claimed 4-21 to win the game for South Africa by 11 runs.\n\nThe cat is out the bag\ud83e\udee2\n\n\n\nGeorge Linde may have missed the bus for the match, but he still TURNED UP for the Proteas in a big way, with a \u201cMan of the Match\u201d performance.\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfcf\n\n\n\nMaybe being late is the secret?\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude0f#WozaNawe #BePartOfIt #SAvPAK pic.twitter.com/G7AgZAhHGA \u2014 Proteas Men (@ProteasMenCSA) December 11, 2024\n\nAfter making his international debut in 2020, Linde was out of the national side for three years. The series against Pakistan was his lifeline to claim a place in South Africa\u2019s squad for Champions Trophy 2025. He also has the numbers to back it up, having scored 379 runs from just six innings and five wickets in the ongoing CSA 4-Day Division 1 tournament. He was also impressive for Western Province in the CSA T20 Challenge with 171 runs and nine wickets in eight matches.\n\nHowever, the 33-year-old\u2019s dream of an ODI comeback after four years crashed after being left out of the 15-man Champions Trophy squad.\n\nSkillset similarity with Keshav Maharaj\n\nBeing a left-arm finger spinner puts Linde in direct competition with vice-captain Keshav Maharaj who is expected to lead the spin department in Pakistan.\n\nThe vast difference in experience is clear as Linde has played just two ODIs in his career, while Maharaj has played 17 ODIs in Asia alone, claiming 24 wickets at an average of 25.\n\nAlso Read: Out-of-Favour Batter Sends Message to Selectors for a Spot in Champions Trophy 2025 Squad\n\nMaharaj also has led South Africa previously in sub-continental conditions which further distances Linde from a playing XI spot.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s many allrounders and hitters\n\nThe Proteas have no dearth of allrounders, be it the fast-bowling type or spinners. The likes of Aiden Markram, Wiaan Mulder and Marco Jansen have been regulars in the national side for the past three years.\n\nLinde is a capable hitter and has shown it in his recent performances in South Africa\u2019s domestic circuit. But South Africa are all stacked with big hitters. Hienrich Klaasen, David Miller and Tristan Stubbs have all featured heavily in franchise cricket in the subcontinent and possess the know-how to play in these conditions.\n\nLinde also played in Pakistan in the Pakistan Premier League for Lahore Qalanders and in the Bangladesh Premier League for Sylhet Strikers. But less than seven matches in these tournaments cannot prompt the selectors to offer Linde a spot in the Champions Trophy.\n\nThere is still hope for the Cape Town native. Firstly, it would take an extraordinary season in the ongoing SA20 and a vacant slot in the preliminary squad by ICC\u2019s deadline date of February 12. Linde has begun well in the SA20, scoring 71 runs in the first two games for MI Cape Town. He needs luck with the other part.\n\nSouth Africa squad for Champions Trophy 2025\n\nTemba Bavuma (c), Tony de Zorzi, Marco Jansen, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, David Miller, Wiaan Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Tabraiz Shamsi, Tristan Stubbs, Rassie van der Dussen.\n\nFor more updates, follow CricXtasy on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Telegram, and YouTube.",

We see a much more integrated manufacturing sector between China and Asean.\u201d \u2014 Neumann\n\nKUALA LUMPUR (Jan 13): Malaysia is benefiting from shifts in supply chains, with the emergence of data centres, tech companies and semiconductor manufacturers in the country, said HSBC Global Research.\n\n\u201cThis supply chain resettlement story is positive for the country,\" said its Asia-Pacific head of equity strategy Herald van der Linde in a virtual briefing on HSBC\u2019s Asian 2025 outlook.\n\nThe expansion of data centres is expected to positively impact the utilities and banking sectors, van der Linde noted.\n\nAs the US reduces its reliance on imports from certain parts of Asia, there is increasing potential for regional integration, said HSBC's chief Asia economist Frederic Neumann.\n\nNeumann pointed to the example of the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone, where both economies are coming together to remove trade barriers and foster closer collaboration.\n\nHSBC Asia-Pacific head of equity strategy Herald van der Linde\n\n\u201cIn other words, challenges stemming from trade restrictions in the US could actually propel greater economic and trade investment integration within Asia,\" he added.\n\nHe also addressed concerns about the competition between Asean and China as manufacturing hubs, emphasising that Asean and China should not be viewed as competitors in a zero-sum game.\n\n\u201cWe see a considerable portion of production capacity being relocated from China into Asean, as shown in the foreign direct investment (FDI) data,\u201d Neumann said.\n\nHSBC chief Asia economist Frederic Neumann\n\n\u201cThis is a story of complementarity [between China and Asean] rather than direct competition. We see a much more integrated manufacturing sector between China and Asean, and we believe that will continue to be a positive growth driver for the Southeast Asian economies,\u201d he added.\n\nStrong dollar poses challenge to Asian equities\n\nThe research house also sees continued FDI, domestic demand recovery, and a strong pipeline of projects to support growth at 4.8% in Malaysia this year, compared with official forecasts of 4.5%-5.5%.\n\n\u201cOur consensus is slightly lower than the 5.2% we had pencilled in for last year, but it is still a very strong record considering the broader economic environment,\u201d Neumann said.\n\nThis resilience in domestic demand is not unique to Malaysia, but reflected in other Southeast Asian economies, Neumann explained.\n\nHowever, while Malaysia\u2019s growth narrative is compelling, he added that relative valuations and strong investor positioning in Malaysian equities limit further upside.\n\n\u201cWe are neutral on Malaysian equities at this particular point in time,\u201d van der Linde said, as the research house maintained its expectations for the FBM KLCI to hit 1,850 points by end-2025, driven by the data centre boom and ongoing supply chain relocation.\n\nLast year, the KLCI ended its three-year streak of annual declines, gaining 13.02% to close at 1,642.33 on Dec 31.\n\nOn Monday, the benchmark index opened 0.21% or 3.45 points lower at 1,598.96. At 11.50am, the index stood at 1,582.52 \u2014 1.24% or 19.89 points lower from the previous close of 1,602.41.\n\nAcross the region, the Asian equity market faces headwinds from a strong US dollar and geopolitical uncertainties, but there are emerging positive trends that signal opportunities for investors, according to van der Linde.\n\n\u201cA stronger US dollar is simply not good for Asian equities. It means money is being reinvested in the US at higher rates. Therefore, there will be little interest to do that in Asian equities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c[But] we see [industries] consolidation and diversification into foreign markets and returning cash to shareholders as positives that support Asian equities,\u201d he noted.\n\nWeak domestic demand, particularly in China, is driving companies to seek new export markets to boost profitability, he said.\n\nCompanies across China, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore are increasingly returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share buy-backs. In China, dividend yields are particularly attractive at around 5%, providing a steady return for investors even in stagnant markets.\n\nAdditionally, while tariffs on Chinese exports goods to the US have raised concerns, their direct impact on Chinese-listed companies remains limited with just up to 1% of earnings impact seen, van der Linde said.",

It is worth noting that the match was marred by constant rain interruptions, and it induced a DLS result after the second delay during the run-chase.\n\nHere\u2019s the timeline of how Super Kings vs MI Cape Town panned out in Johannesburg:\n\nSuper Kings vs MI Cape Town Highlights: MI Cape Town Slip To 30-4 In 8.3 Overs\n\nBeing invited to bat first, MI Cape Town lost opening batter Reeza Hendricks for a sluggish four from 13 balls to Joburg Super Kings quick Evan Jones (1-24) in the fourth over of the match. Rassie van der Dussen lost his balance while completing a run, while wicketkeeper-batter Connor Esterhuizen (8 off 13) and number four Colin Ingram (11 off 12) were accounted by David Wiese (1-19) and Tabraiz Shamsi (1-19) respectively.\n\nBy the time of Ingram\u2019s departure in the ninth over of the innings, the MI Cape Town crashed to a troublesome 30-4.\n\nSuper Kings vs MI Cape Town Highlights: George Linde, Potgieter Counterattack With Swift 40s\n\nDewald Brevis reformed MI Cape Town\u2019s struggling innings to some extent by sharing a fighting 43-run partnership with George Linde. In a bid to enhance his team\u2019s scoring rate in the backend of the innings, Brevis top-edged one towards Leus du Plooy off Lutho Sipamla (1-31). The following over, Azmatullah Omarzai fell short of his crease courtesy of a mix-up as the visitors\u2019 troubles worsened further at 75-6.\n\nUnbeaten George Linde counterattacked Joburg Super Kings bowlers with a burgeoning 65-run unbeaten partnership with Delano Potgieter. While Linde top-scored with a composed 48* from 35 balls, Potgieter smeared four boundaries and three sixes in his 22-ball 44* to bolt the MI Cape Town to a competitive 140-6 from 20 overs.\n\nSuper Kings vs MI Cape Town Highlights: Faf du Plessis Unleashes Boundary Barrage\n\nMI Cape Town new ball seamer Trent Boult got the opening breakthrough for his team with the wicket of Joburg Super Kings opener and fellow New Zealand national Devon Conway for just nine in the third over of the run-chase.\n\nConway\u2019s skipper and opening partner Faf du Plessis responded back with a swift 30-run knock from just 23 balls with four boundaries and a six. Taking the Super Kings to 46-1 by the end of the seventh over, captain Faf was done-in by Kagiso Rabada courtesy of a screamer from Dewald Brevis.\n\nSuper Kings vs MI Cape Town Highlights: Leus du Plooy Remains Unbeaten In DLS Chase\n\nLeus du Plooy at number three made an unbeaten 24* from 23 balls to steer Joburg Super Kings to 82-3 from 11.3 overs before rains halted play in Johannesburg.\n\nFinding themselves six runs ahead of the par total, the Super Kings won the match courtesy of DLS method to open their account on the SA20 2025 points table.\n\n\n\n",

JSK were well-positioned at 82/3 after 11.3 overs when rain returned, putting them six runs ahead on the DLS calculation. With the downpour persisting, the game was called off, handing JSK the victory and four valuable match points.At the crease for JSK when play stopped were Leus du Plooy (24 not out) and Wihan Lubbe (0 not out). Captain Faf du Plessis provided a steady foundation earlier in the innings with a 30-run knock, off 23 balls, before a stunning dismissal, caught by Dewald Brevis at the cover boundary. Brevis showcased exceptional athleticism, tipping the ball back into play and completing a diving catch in the same motion.For MI Cape Town, Kagiso Rabada impressed in his first appearance of Season 3, claiming 2/10 in a fiery spell. However, his efforts were in vain as the rain thwarted Cape Town's chances of a comeback.Earlier in the day, MI Cape Town\u2019s innings struggled for momentum, with JSK reducing them to 30/4. George Linde played a crucial role in the recovery, anchoring the innings with an unbeaten 48 off 35 balls, laced with five boundaries and two sixes.Linde found brief support in Brevis, who contributed 14 runs in a 43-run fifth-wicket partnership, but further setbacks followed as Azmatullah Omarzai fell for just one.Delano Potgieter continued his fine form from the season opener, smashing a rapid 44 not out off 22 balls. His knock, featuring four boundaries and three sixes, came in an unbroken 65-run partnership with Linde, propelling MI Cape Town to a respectable 140/6.Despite their spirited effort, the weather ultimately decided the outcome, with JSK emerging triumphant in the rain-curtailed encounter. The victory boosts JSK's campaign as they look to maintain momentum in a highly competitive tournament.",

Du Plessis attempted an inside-out drive off a length ball pitched just outside off. The ball soared towards the boundary, seemingly destined for a six, but Brevis, stationed at long-off, had other plans.\n\nWith agility and foresight, Brevis sprinted, leapt, and managed to get his fingers under the ball just before it could cross the boundary. In a display of presence of mind, after the initial catch, he flicked the ball back into the air as he teetered on the edge of the rope, then leapt again to complete what was a breathtaking catch. The crowd erupted in applause, and the moment was soon etched into SA20 folklore.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nGeorge Linde propels MI Cape Town to a respectable total\n\nMI Cape Town, batting first, managed a total of 140 runs for the loss of 6 wickets in their innings. The pitch offered some assistance to the bowlers, making it a challenging task to score freely. George Linde was the standout performer for MICT, scoring an unbeaten 48 off 35 balls, with his innings punctuated by 5 fours and 2 sixes. Delano Potgieter also contributed significantly, adding 44 off 24, which provided some late impetus to the innings. The Joburg Super Kings\u2019 bowlers kept the pressure on throughout, with David Wiese being particularly effective, taking 1 wicket for just 19 runs. Tabraiz Shamsi and Evan Jones supported with economical bowling, ensuring MICT couldn\u2019t post a daunting total.\n\nJoburg Super Kings clinch win via DLS method\n\nJSK\u2019s chase was interrupted by rain, leading to a revised target of 136 runs in 19 overs under the DLS method. The innings began shakily with early dismissals, but Du Plessis provided some stability, scoring 30 off 23 balls. His innings ended with a spectacular catch by Brevis, which was a turning point. Leus du Plooy then stepped up, playing a crucial knock of 24 off 23, guiding his team towards the adjusted target with a blend of calm and aggression. Joburg Super Kings ended up winning the game by 6 runs via the DLS method, showcasing their ability to adapt and perform under pressure.",

According to the weather report, there is no expected chance of rain during the match. On January 13, in Newlands, the minimum temperature will be recorded at 16\u00b0C, and the maximum will reach 27\u00b0C, providing great playing conditions.\n\nMICT vs PR Preview\n\nMI Cape Town has played two matches this season, winning one and losing one. On the other hand, Paarl Royals won their opening match against Sunrisers Eastern Cape. Both teams have one win, but MI Cape Town earned bonus points in their victory against JSK which places them at the top of the table with 5 points. Royals, with 4 points, are tied with Joburg Super Kings and Durban Super Giants but are in second place due to a better run rate.\n\nMICT vs PR Dream11 Prediction\n\nIf players from both MI Cape Town and Paarl Royals are compared based on Dream points earned this season, Cape Town\u2019s all-rounder Delano Potgieter leads by a long way with 278 points. Potgieter bats at number 8 and has played brilliant cameos in both matches. He shone with the ball as well, taking a 5-wicket haul against Sunrisers Eastern Cape.\n\nPaarl Royals\u2019 opener Lhuan-du Pretorius, who scored a brilliant 97 runs innings in the previous match, is in second place with 137 Dream points. Following him are George Linde, Dewald Brevis, and Trent Boult, who have earned 130, 118, and 117 points respectively. Rashid Khan has gone wicketless in the two matches so far, but being a seasoned player, he remains a safe option.\n\nWicket-keepers: L Pretorius (VC)\n\nBatsmen: D Miller, J Root, R van der-Dussen (C), D Brevis\n\nAll-rounders: G Linde, D Potgieter\n\nBowlers: R Khan, K Maphaka, Mujeeb-ur-Rahman, Lungi Ngidi\n\nNewlands Cape Town Pitch Report for MICT vs PR Match\n\nNewlands, Cape Town, has been a high-scoring venue in SA20 history. Teams have successfully chased targets of 190+ on several occasions. In the MICT vs PR match, the team batting first would ideally aim to score 180+ runs, as defending a target lower than that can be challenging on this pitch. Bowling first is often considered the preferable decision at Newlands, as it is a good venue for chasing in the shortest format.",

While the days since October 7, 2023, have been difficult for all of us, it has been a great honor for me to edit this magazine, especially during the past 15 months of the worst war in Israel\u2019s history. Together we have mourned our losses, saluted the bravery of our soldiers, and admired the resilience of our citizens. While reporting on tragedy and triumph, we have sought to focus this magazine on the good things people here in Israel and abroad are doing.\n\nJournalistically, I\u2019ve done all I can to contribute to the war effort. Together with the superb team at The Jerusalem Report, I\u2019ve sought to present a true and accurate picture of Israel, a remarkable country that has been \u201ca light unto the nations\u201d ever since its establishment in 1948. I\u2019m acutely aware that the profession of journalism is constantly maligned, and not just by our leaders, but I firmly believe that trustworthy media are vital for a free and thriving democracy.\n\nAt the office and at home, I have followed the Jewish National Fund-USA slogan, \u201cChoose life.\u201d Change, as we learned since corona, is healing and necessary for our growth as individuals, as a nation, and internationally. While Israel continues to seek the release of the hostages and the defeat of its enemies, I\u2019m going to take a short break and then start a new journey in journalism.\n\nI have a sign on my desk that reads \u201cI love my job; please don\u2019t hate me.\u201d I really have loved my job and my colleagues, but my job is now done, and it\u2019s time to move on. My colleagues and the people we\u2019ve interviewed have provided constant inspiration. Let me take this opportunity to thank you all, graphic artist David Yaphe, copy editor Ruth Beloff, proofreader Elaine Moshe, writers past and present, and illustrator Avi Katz, who returned to work for us just before the war began.\n\nThe Jerusalem Report under Steve Linde\n\nDuring my editorship I have met many special people, one of whom \u2013 renowned Bedouin expert Clinton Bailey \u2013 died in Jerusalem at 88 on January 5. Among my colleagues, none has been as inspirational as Walter Bingham, who turned 101 on January 5 and is the world\u2019s oldest working journalist and broadcaster. As he wrote in The Jerusalem Report, all he wants for his birthday is the return of the hostages. Walter Bingham holds up the certificate acknowledging his record as the oldest journalist in the world during a visit to \u2018The Jerusalem Report\u2019 (credit: STEVE LINDE)\n\nThe Jerusalem Report was founded in 1990 by my South African landsman, Hirsh Goodman, with a mission to cover Israel, the Middle East, and the Jewish world. Today it is owned by Eli Azur\u2019s Jerusalem Post Group, priding itself on being editorially independent, balanced, and fair.\n\nI wish you well, dear readers, and wish all the best to my superstar successor, Tamar Uriel-Beeri, who previously served as managing editor of JPost.com and as the deputy editor of The Jerusalem Post. My best advice to her is to share the words imparted to me by a colleague: \u201cMay you be proud of the work you have done, the person you are, and the difference you have made.\u201d\n\nMay 2025 see a speedy return of the hostages and a decisive Israeli victory in this multi-front war.

He's had many run-ins with them over the last 50 years including 10 conduct reviews and one suspension. He was warned in the mid-1980s about his conduct when speaking to the media.\n\nThe decision said throughout the hearings Linde has framed the disciplinary proceedings as a restraint on freedom of expression.\n\n\"Of significant impact to the (Law Society) in this matter is the awareness of (Linde) providing press interviews about sensitive topics restricted by Canadian court orders to American news outlets where (he) admitted there was no jurisdiction for the BC Supreme Court to govern,\" the decision read.\n\nEven after the regulator started taking action against him he spoke at length to an Internet-based reporter.\n\nREAD MORE: Feuding Kelowna siblings back in court over $24M land sale\n\nThe Law Society called this \"reprehensible conduct\" and \"extremely disappointing.\"\n\nThe decision said the proceedings were made lengthy and complex as Linde justified breaching the court orders while advocating for his clients' positions in the court cases.\n\nThe regulator decided as Linde resigned his registration in 2023, a four-month suspension was appropriate if he ever reapplied.\n\nThe regulator had wanted him to pay $24,000 in costs but said his financial situation was \"grave\" as he lived in a one-bedroom apartment and his only asset was a 2015 Ford Escape.\n\n\"His little income does not cover his living expenses,\" the decision read.\n\nInstead, the Law Society ordered him to pay $12,168 and gave him four months to do so.\n\nTo contact a reporter for this story, email Ben Bulmer or call (250) 309-5230 or email the editor.

We see one another not just as colleagues and managers but also friends and family \u2013 as comrades in the great endeavor known as journalism. But that also makes it hard to say goodbye when someone leaves.\n\nThat is the case with Steve Linde.\n\nFor years, Linde has been a pillar of The Jerusalem Post, and as editor-in-chief from 2011 to 2016, he helped shape the paper into the bastion of quality reporting it is today. Soon after he left that position, he took over The Jerusalem Report bi-weekly magazine and proceeded to do the same, filling every issue with quality features and insightful opinions and analyses.\n\nTwo generations of journalists built themselves up here at the Post under Linde\u2019s stewardship, and it is hard to imagine what the paper would be like without his cheerful presence in the office.\n\nBut now he has decided to go on to do other things.

(credit: MARC ISRAEL SELLEM)\n\nWith that in mind, In Jerusalem sat down with Linde for this special edition of Behind the Bylines as we learn about his journalistic journey and can hear some more pearls of wisdom from him one final time.\n\nWhat brought you to Israel/Jerusalem?\n\nI made aliyah from South Africa via the United States in 1988 to be with my sister and her family after our mother, Roseve Linde, died. After doing my undergraduate degree in journalism and sociology at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, I moved to California, where I earned a graduate degree in journalism from the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nI taught at a Jewish day school in El Cerrito (Tehiyah) and a synagogue in Berkeley (Beth El) for a couple of years before making the decision to move to Israel, which had been my dream ever since I first came here with my family as a boy. After my arrival, I joined the army, serving in IDF Artillery, and started my journalistic career at Kol Yisrael (Israel Radio\u2019s) English News.\n\nWhat sparked your interest in journalism?\n\nI loved writing in high school (Carmel College), and we had great English teachers. I also have an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a passion for justice. And I feel much more comfortable asking questions than answering them. I loved Superman comics, and my dream as a boy was to become Perry White, the fearless editor of The Daily Planet.\n\nI started writing regularly when I came on ulpan to Jerusalem (Kiryat Moriah) in 1975 with 50 other South African Jewish students, under the guidance of our beloved Hebrew teacher, Dr. Issy Fisher and his wife, Judy, who encouraged me to write about our experiences in Israel. On my return, I started writing for the Jewish newspaper in Durban (Hashalom) and later for a regular newspaper (The Daily News), the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), and the campus newspaper at Rhodes under apartheid.

On my first night alone as night editor (February 4, 1997), two IAF helicopters crashed in the North, killing 73 soldiers in what was the worst aerial disaster in Israeli history. As my colleague Liat Collins advised me at the time, I took a deep breath, stayed calm, and did the best I could. I later worked my way up to news editor, managing editor, and finally editor-in-chief (2011-16). I took a short break after stepping down, and then returned to become editor of The Jerusalem Report in 2017.\n\nWhat was it like rising to editor-in-chief?\n\nIn the beginning it was like having my youthful dreams realized. I was treated like royalty wherever I went, and I was invited to speak to audiences all over the world. In fact, it was under my editorship that we started our annual conference in New York for our American readers and in Jerusalem for our Israeli readers (although the first one was actually held in Herzliya). I met and interviewed some amazing people, such as Shimon Peres, Elie Wiesel, Dr. Ruth, and Michael Douglas.\n\nTell us about the direction of the paper in your time as editor-in-chief.\n\nUnder legendary managing editor David Brinn, and news editors Ilan Evyatar and Noa Amouyal, we had a first-class reporting staff that included top journalists such as Herb Keinon, Tovah Lazaroff, Judy Siegel, Greer Fay Cashman, Seth Frantzman, Khaled Abu Toameh, Liat Collins, and Ruth Eglash [some of whom are still with the Post].\n\nI like to think that I steered the newspaper to the political center with more balanced coverage after it had tilted to the Left and then the Right for many years since its founding by Gershon Agron in 1932. Under my editorship, we had some really big names writing op-eds for us, such as Caroline Glick, Melanie Phillips, Sarah Honig, and Martin Sherman on the Right, and Uri Savir, Gershon Baskin, Hirsh Goodman, Ben Caspit, Avraham Avi-hai, and Pamela Peled on the Left.\n\nWhat made you step aside?\n\nAs the years progressed, I found the daily pressures of being editor of the Post increasingly stressful; and after my dad, Hilly Linde, became ill and died just before a New York conference, and I had a health scare myself, I decided together with our management to hand over the editorship to our former military correspondent Yaakov Katz, who had moderated the conference brilliantly in my place.\n\nTell us about your time heading \u2018The Jerusalem Report.\u2019\n\nI\u2019ve never enjoyed a job as much as I have editing The Jerusalem Report for the past seven years, which afforded me the time to do all kinds of interesting things and meet interesting people. Because it is published every two weeks, the magazine doesn\u2019t have the same kinds of pressures as daily journalism.\n\nI have a sign on my desk that reads \u201cI love my job; please don\u2019t hate me.\u201d I really have loved my job and my colleagues, and it felt like we were doing something really important, particularly after Oct. 7, 2023, reporting on the tragedies, as well as the triumphs, of the war. My talented colleagues and the good people doing wonderful things that we\u2019ve showcased in the magazine have provided constant inspiration.\n\nIn the last few months, though, I have encountered more and more signs indicating that I needed to move on. I felt it in my gut, and I have learned to listen to my gut. I\u2019ve had seven fulfilling years at the magazine, but it\u2019s time for me to move on. I think that every leader needs to know when to step aside and to prime a successor. I\u2019m happy that Tamar Uriel-Beeri, who has served as managing editor of JPost.com and deputy editor of The Jerusalem Post, has been named as my successor. I know she will be perfect for the job!\n\nDo you have a favorite anecdote from your journalistic career?\n\nWhen I first became editor of The Jerusalem Post, I went with journalist Greer Fay Cashman to meet Shimon Peres at the President\u2019s Residence. I remember him pouring us a glass of red wine and toasting to my editorship. I asked Peres for his best advice to me as the new editor of the Post, and his answer was memorable: \u201cIt\u2019s your job to tell people what to think about, and not what to think.\u201d\n\nI met and interviewed Peres many times over the next five years. Once he made me laugh when I asked him a question, and he went way off topic. \u201cBut Mr. President, that\u2019s not what I asked you,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault that you asked me the wrong question,\u201d he quipped.\n\nWhat are your feelings now that you\u2019re stepping away from journalism?\n\nI\u2019m not stepping away from journalism. In fact, I have some good ideas that I\u2019d like to pursue, such as a podcast and a book. And if there\u2019s anyone out there who could use my talents, please contact me at stevesaxelinde@gmail.com!\n\nWhat advice do you have for aspiring journalists?\n\nMy best advice is that if you really want to be a journalist, you should investigate all the options available, from daily newspapers and monthly magazines to news websites and broadcast news. While the profession itself is much maligned and morphing in all different directions, I think there will always be a place in a vibrant democracy \u2013 especially in Israel \u2013 for good journalists, writers, and broadcasters.\n\nMy favorite films and books are about journalism or by journalists, and I highly recommend a film that premiered this month at the Jerusalem Jewish Film Festival. I was invited to see it by Hannah Brown, the Jerusalem Post\u2019s superb film critic. It\u2019s called September 5 and it\u2019s about ABC\u2019s dramatic live coverage of the Munich Summer Olympics massacre.\n\nAfter watching it, I now understand why the Post\u2019s headline on September 6, 1972, got it so wrong \u2013 \u201cHostages in Munich rescued\u201d \u2013 perhaps the worst mistake in the paper\u2019s history. [The Israeli coaches and athletes who were taken hostage were all killed in the rescue attempt.] In a very Israeli moment after the film, a sports broadcaster named Yehuda Snapiri told us what it was like to be in Munich at the time, and about the tragedy that actually transpired.\n\nFor me, journalism is the best way to travel, meet interesting people, and write about them. As Elie Wiesel observed, God created people because He loves a good story, and journalism is the art of telling a good story.\uf06e\n\n\u2018The Jerusalem Post\u2019 staff says goodbye to Steve Linde\n\nSteve, for many years I admired your work long before I had the privilege of joining The Jerusalem Post. To me, you are one of the defining figures that come to mind when I think of the Post. I have learned so much from you over the years, but one lesson stands out above all: how to be a true mensch. Your kindness, integrity, and generosity have left an indelible mark on everyone around you. It\u2019s no surprise that you are universally loved because you embody what it means to be a mensch, now and always. \u2013 Zvika Klein, Jerusalem Post editor-in-chief\n\nSteve, we\u2019ve been colleagues and friends since the early 1990s. We\u2019ve put out 1,001 papers together, and I was your right-hand man during your tenure as editor-in-chief of the Post. In all these years, I\u2019ve seen you act only in the most decent way in your approach to people, the news, and life. You\u2019re an example of how we should all strive to behave. I\u2019ll miss being your next-door neighbor in the office, and wish you all the happiness in the world as you begin your next chapter of a book that is far from its completion. \u2013 David Brinn, Jerusalem Post senior editor\n\nFor all of those working at our Jerusalem offices, Steve Linde is an inseparable part of our unique and wonderful organization. Steve, I cannot imagine this place without you, and I only hope to do you justice as your successor! \u2013 Tamar Uriel-Beeri, Outgoing Jerusalem Post deputy editor-in-chief and incoming Jerusalem Report editor\n\nWhat a pleasure and privilege it has been to have worked with Steve Linde for so many years! He\u2019s a superb journalist and a fantastic human being. Professionally, we first began working together in February 1997, on his first night as news editor at The Jerusalem Post. Tragically, the news was of the helicopter disaster in which 73 IDF soldiers were killed. Steve managed to keep calm and showed he could put out a paper under the most challenging of circumstances. Fortunately, over the years there have also been many happy occasions and good news to report and share.\n\nHis dedication and professionalism have been seen in all the positions he has held. No less important, so have his personal attributes: his warmth, inquiring mind, and principles. Steve has always been ready to nurture young reporters and editors \u2013 those just starting out in their careers \u2013 and has never forsaken the elderly, understanding the wisdom and knowledge that is found with those in their 80s, 90s, and, in Walter Bingham\u2019s case, on his way to 120.\n\nI\u2019m sure Steve will be missed by all those who have worked with him at the Post, but I\u2019m equally sure his talents and personality will be appreciated by everyone who meets him in the next chapter of his life\u2019s ventures and adventures. \u2013 Liat Collins, Former Jerusalem Post senior editor\n\nI first met Steve behind police barricades just outside the Prime Minister\u2019s Office in the early 1990s, waiting for Ariel Sharon. Those were the heady days of massive Russian immigration, and Sharon \u2013 chair of the \u201caliyah cabinet\u201d \u2013 held weekly meetings, after which he would go outside and throw some crumbs to the press.\n\nThe reporters and photographers would jostle for position, and in the scrum a couple of more mild-mannered reporters would always end up toward the back: Steve, working for Kol Yisrael\u2019s English department, and myself. Steve, I was struck then by your calmness and professionalism, attributes that remained with you when you moved to the Post.\n\nWhether as night editor, managing editor, or editor-in-chief, I always found you composed and professional \u2013 no small achievement considering the atomic pressures of the job. Here\u2019s wishing you every success going forward. \u2013 Herb Keinon, Senior contributing editor\n\nIn all the years I\u2019ve known you \u2013 including the time you were editor-in-chief of the paper \u2013 I have never seen you get angry, yell, or be mean to a staffer. You have an incredible disposition and respect for all \u2013 uncommon in newspaper editors and journalists. \u201cCaring,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d and \u201cprofessional\u201d are the best words to describe you, and I wish you well in your future career. \u2013 Judy Siegel-Itzkovich, Health and science feature writer\n\nThank you, Steve, for being more than an editor but also a friend who listened to my gripes, a dining companion, and an escort to cultural and diplomatic events. Hopefully, your next journalism journey will be rewarding professionally and financially. But remember: The JP is a revolving door \u2013 that you used in the past and may use again in the future. You have a lot of friends here who all wish you well. \u2013 Greer Faye Cashman, Columnist, feature writer, and reporter\n\nSteve, you have been a friend and colleague for the decade and a half that I\u2019ve known you at the Post. You hired me as op-ed editor of the paper years ago, and since then you have always been a pillar at the paper and in all things. I wish you happiness in all future endeavors. \u2013 Seth Frantzman, Senior Middle East analyst\n\nI met Steve when I became Jerusalem Post photographer. He was the first person to welcome me, offer me advice, and give me direction. Steve was news editor at the time and helped me a lot; I will never be able to thank him enough. We have done some great stuff together professionally, including a trip to Romania, which was so much fun! He is a man of pure heart. When he left his position as editor-in-chief of The Jerusalem Post I was sad; now that he is leaving the Report, I am sad once more. He is not only a boss, he is a forever friend. \u2013 Marc Israel Sellem, Jerusalem Post senior photographer\n\nSteve Linde has been a towering presence at the Post since I started. His door is always open to talk to him, and the advice and help he gives from years of experience is highly appreciated and valued. He will be greatly missed here. \u2013 Alex Winston, News editor\n\nSteve, you have been a stabilizing, veteran, and ever-present presence both in the office and hovering over the Post operation, and you have always been there to \u201cLinde\u201d a hand. A colleague and friend who always shares good advice and doesn\u2019t seem to have any bad vice. Much success and fulfillment in the next chapters of your Book of Life! \u2013 Natan Rothstein, Feature writer and copy editor\n\nSteve, it has been a pleasure working with you these past three years. Thank you for your patience in the beginning and your calmness during the hiccups that plague this industry. I wish you lots of success in the near future, and we all hope you stay in touch. \u2013 David Yaphe, Graphic designer\n\nFrom Jerusalem Post news editor to editor-in-chief and ultimately editor of the prestigious Jerusalem Report, Steve has been an exemplary and inspiring colleague, boss, friend, and human being \u2013 and a joy to be around. I am excited to discover what his new horizons will look like and am convinced that they will be noteworthy. \u2013 Marion Fischel, Literary and copy editor\n\nTo Steve, so gentle and so kind,\n\nA sweeter man one cannot find;\n\nTo work with you was a delight \u2013\n\nA pro so seasoned and so bright.\n\nAlthough I\u2019m sad to see you leave,\n\nEnjoy the road ahead, dear Steve. \u2013 Ruth Beloff, Jerusalem Post proofreader and Report copy editor\n\nA word from the Editor:\n\nMentor. Mensch.\n\nThose are the two words that come to mind when I think of Steve Linde. He was my first boss at The Jerusalem Post, when I began 13 years ago as a night copy editor and he was editor-in-chief. I must admit I was a bit intimidated. Yet, despite his lofty perch, he was always warm, approachable, and promoting my growth as an employee.\n\nCommitted to the paper\u2019s ideals, he regularly received calls from various political poohbahs, trying to get him to see it their way \u2013 yet he stayed the course. Despite his elevated stature and influence, he remained humble.\n\nBeyond that, I was amazed at how Steve went above and beyond to help others, even visiting elderly longtime readers in their homes.\n\nAs time went on and he moved to The Jerusalem Report, while still working in the same office, I have come to regard Steve as a friend.\n\nAs he once said, as my direct supervisor when I rose to become an editor working under the pressure of weekly deadlines, he\u2019s seen me at my best and worst. Those words have stuck with me, and I\u2019ve striven to be my best, keeping my cool and always treating others with dignity, as he has modeled for me.\n\nI will miss seeing him regularly in a work context: Steve Linde, the legend with the Zimbabwe accent. \u2013 Erica Schachne",

            "content": "\u2715\n\nSANAA\u2019s much anticipated Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building officially opens its doors to the public next month\u2014for Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, their fourth building in the United States. Situated on the MIT campus, it extends westward the Infinite Corridor\u2014what is colloquially known as the Outfinite Corridor\u2014on axis with MIT\u2019s historic entrance on Massachusetts Avenue. Effectively, this area comprises what is possibly the most memorable 20th-century contribution to the campus, with Eero Saarinen\u2019s MIT Chapel and Kresge Auditorium (both 1955) framing the Kresge Oval, a public lawn with Eduardo Catalano\u2019s Stratton Student Center (1963) to its north, and Alvar Aalto\u2019s Baker House (1949) just southwest, making for a formidable Modernist context.\n\nThe volumes of the new music building are set between Aalto\u2019s Baker House and Saarinen\u2019s Kresge Auditorium. Photo \u00a9 Ken\u2019Ichi Suzuki, click to enlarge.\n\nIf Saarinen had gotten his way, the chapel and auditorium would have been framed within a master plan of his own making, a larger quad encircled by a thicket of trees on three sides and an institutional building fabric on its western edge, a bookend bringing the academic campus to a terminus facing the sports fields. Of course, history would veer off this path, and, instead, SANAA would inherit the western flank, alongside the athletic complex. Providing an academic home for the music program\u2014the first campus building dedicated solely to music\u2014the siting of SANAA\u2019s project is critical. Adjacent to Kresge Auditorium, this allows for the creation of a Performing Arts hub for MIT at large.\n\n\n\n1 The arches of Kresge Auditorium, in the background (1) and foreground (2), are seen in relation to those of SANAA\u2019s building. Photos \u00a9 Ken\u2019Ichi Suzuki\n\n\n\n2\n\nSANAA\u2019s most memorable contribution to MIT is its response to Saarinen\u2019s intended master plan, not so much framing the quad with the backdrop he had envisioned but rather designing an \u201cobject building,\u201d whose configuration has the capacity to orchestrate a sophisticated urban-design narrative within. The music building absorbs the ambulatory complexity of the campus by acting as the fulcrum through which the students circulate toward their ultimate daily destinations: the dormitories to the southeast and northeast of the sports fields. The circulation of the building is defined by a Y-shaped figure that draws in two diagonal prongs on the east connecting to the campus, and a third prong on the west, framing an expansive view of the sports fields. The porosity of this promenade is all the more important, given the necessary insularity of the building type. The urban strategy is further enhanced by Reed Hilderbrand\u2019s landscape, layering trees within a middle ground, helping to mediate between Saarinen\u2019s auditorium while punctuating the episodic nature of the promenade.\n\nIf SANAA\u2019s composition would seem like an urban-design contrivance\u2014embodying the potent scenographic strategies of Galli da Bibiena, but here relieved of the mannerism of his surfaces\u2014then one must also consider the challenge from a programmatic perspective. The division of the building into three volumes within the negative space of the Y stems from a fortunate acoustic mandate requiring sound isolation among the three key functions of the program: Thomas Tull Hall (a concert hall), the Beatrice and Stephen Erdely Music and Culture Space (a rehearsal room primarily for percussion), and the Jae S. and Kyuho Lim Music Maker Pavilion (composed of practice rooms, classrooms, a makerspace, and offices). Polemically breaking with the formality of Saarinen\u2019s icons on the east\u2013west axis, the triad of brick volumes functions as a still-life of sorts, with an animate silhouette that mirrors the programmatic blocks and visually dissipates the monumentality of MIT Chapel and Kresge Auditorium with an architectural \u201cbreakwater\u201d\u2014allowing the axis to disperse through the cracks of SANAA\u2019s clay monoliths.\n\nThe concert hall seats close to 400 around a central performance space. Photo \u00a9 Ken\u2019Ichi Suzuki\n\nA rehearsal room hosts musicians on percussion instruments. Photo \u00a9 Ken\u2019Ichi Suzuki\n\nCourageous in the risk this strategy entails\u2014effectively extending Saarinen\u2019s axis with a third object, albeit aggregated as an assembly of parts\u2014SANAA deftly confronts the dilemma of reverence and irreverence that is the inevitable challenge its contribution poses. Though sculptural in its massing, the adoption of redbrick cladding invariably forces the building to recede as part of its context, inconspicuously forming an extended brick tapestry of 270 degrees, from MIT Chapel, Maseeh Hall (1901), and Baker House all the way around to Davis Brody\u2019s Johnson Athletics Center (1981). In other words\u2014despite its formal exuberance, the music building serves as a Band-Aid, bridging the gap on its western flank and creating an extended backdrop for Kresge Auditorium\u2014ensuring that it remains the most dominant figure in the urban space. Stealth in its materiality, yet articulated in its composition, SANAA maneuvers the building towards a seeming contradiction, a deliberate ambivalence it straddles with some confidence.\n\nEach volume is built of steel framing with a double shell of precast concrete to ensure full acoustic autonomy. Thus the seemingly random scattering of brick boxes is anything but, and is somehow a semantic embodiment of the inevitable acoustic separation required between the main programmatic elements, in direct orchestration with a strategic urban narrative. As great architects might, their thoughtful collaboration was reinforced, on the one hand, by the acoustic precision of Nagata Acoustics and, on the other, by the leadership of Keeril Makan, an extraordinary composer and associate dean of the school of humanities, who acted as a sounding board for MIT\u2019s varied musical talents. Together, they set their eyes on Frank Gehry\u2019s Pierre Boulez Hall in Berlin, which would serve as a model for the type of flexibility their proposed concert hall would engender. If the mission of the music building was to provide a dignified home for its students and faculty, then how it negotiates its visual and acoustic performance would be balanced out by this expanded team. Beyond the purity of the mute clay blocks, interventions punctuating the massing register a language that betrays hints of recognizable elements: of apses and bays for practice/green rooms, of fluting and striations for surfaces, all formal deformations indicating an escape from the rectitude of the platonic volumes. These formal and geometric tropes address acoustic mitigation, attending to such phenomena as reverberation and resonance, all while embracing the manner in which the forms mediate between the inside and outside, the surfaces and the massing.\n\nAll said, the allusive nature of these figures maintains a distance from both typological and iconographic quotations. By their own admission, the architects\u2019 embrace of the radial forms in plan and section was a way to create a dialogue with Saarinen\u2019s chapel and auditorium, two buildings whose languages are distinct in their own right\u2014different scales, materials, geometries, and levels of detail. They nonetheless revolve around a shared formal foundation to which the music building adds a new chapter. With the introduction of the monumental arches (the manifestation of the Y in spatial terms), SANAA takes a turn in its trajectory that is possibly less predictable. The firm\u2019s history of formal explorations commonly maintains a fidelity to abstraction, allusive connections to the landscape, and self-similarity, swerving away from referential overtness. From the main perspective of the Outfinite Corridor looking east, then, one cannot suppress the iconographic bias linking SANAA\u2019s new entry arch to the Kresge vault and the lower arches of the MIT Chapel, all collapsed into one view; here we witness a linguistic dimension in this work, something that is less common in the firm\u2019s oeuvre. SANAA\u2019s own three arches vary in size, scale, and hierarchy, all beautifully converging as a vortex at the center of the lobby; but its main arch, facing the Outfinite Corridor, is also meant to serve as an outdoor rehearsal room, with the conical geometry of the arch containing the sound, all while communicating an ambiguously \u201cgramophonic\u201d figure with semantic range. In the richness of this view, Saarinen, the gramophone, and the acoustic performance of arches meet in what is akin to \u201ca chance encounter of a sewing machine and umbrella on an operating table.\u201d\n\n\n\n3 The exterior arches (3 - 5), converge in the interior lobby space (3 & 6) between the three brick volumes. Photos \u00a9 Ken\u2019Ichi Suzuki\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nDespite this, the exposure of the curved extruded I-beams, the revelation of the standing-seam metal roofing atop, and the rawness of the building\u2019s expression are so deadpan in their representation that they defy the kind of transcendence one immateriality, of visual ambiguity, and of experiential phenomena, this building remains stoic in its allegiance to material conventionalism, a realism that seeks beauty in the everyday. In the past, the architects have worked painstakingly to hide the evidence of the building\u2019s infrastructure behind the scenes, making things look simple even when the labor of concealment is a monumental architectural task; here, things remain exposed in their exacting organization. Sejima and Nishizawa, in speaking with me, referred to the difficulty of finding the right brick unit for this special occasion, a brick with the versatility of turning corners, navigating radii, and other feats intended to secure its mass. For a curtain wall, they undertook all efforts to maintain the integrity of the brick volumes as monolithic blocks, even if the inevitable requirement of expansion joints compromises the continuity of the running bond assemblage. Still, it is in the specification of things so prosaic that we discover a stubborn adherence to SANAA\u2019s sense of the generic, that also comes through in the matter-of-fact institutional characteristics, elegant and precise as they are, but also explicit in their insistence that the building is \u201cjust a building.\u201d\n\nThough this might seem a deviation in SANAA\u2019s path, I think it\u2019s a self-conscious one, where the architects focus not only on visual phenomena as played out through their formal, spatial, and material strategies, but expand their lens to a broader sensorial field. As such, the building\u2019s visual dexterity is not only legible at the urban scale but transformative for the campus at large\u2014and the closer one gets to its surfaces, its interiors, and its details, the more the visual recedes intentionally, displaced by a necessary deference to the auditory. The building\u2019s performance aptly transcends normative experiences within an amplified sonic medium\u2014embracing their rightful audiences, the building chambers eventually find their voice as a series of mellifluous acoustic instruments.\n\nClick plan to enlarge\n\nClick plan to enlarge\n\nClick section to enlarge\n\nClick detail to enlarge",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 29 Stocks Ahead Of Major AI Event. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) stands against other stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed.\n\nIn his appearance on Squawk on the Street the day CES took place in Las Vegas, Jim Cramer commented on the stock market division that persisted throughout 2024 and is present in 2025 as well. The division has seen technology stocks perform well, while other rate-sensitive sectors such as industrial and materials stocks have languished. Cramer commented on the reasons behind it: \u201cI think that\u2019s because people perceive that the rest of the market is hostage to rates. And that tech is not hostage to anything. So I\u2019m aware of that and I\u2019m just concerned that you have this speech tonight, nine-thirty Jensen Huang, everyone\u2019s, we\u2019re really kind of, whatever he says, is going to move things.\u201d\n\nIn fact, this division is so prevalent that some of the biggest asset managers in the world have also been unable to remain immune to it. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared that it commented about \u201cprivate equity and private equity trying to get into the 401(k) business.\u201d He added and mentioned, \u201cMarc Rowan CEO of Apollo says, I jokingly say sometimes we levered the entire retirement [inaudible] to NVIDIA\u2019s performance! So [inaudible] we\u2019ve got the NVIDIAs of the world which everybody likes and on the other hand, there\u2019s these stocks are, they really are hostage to rates and no one wants them!\u201d\n\nHowever, even though technology stocks have stood the test of high interest rates, they might falter in some circumstances. One of these can be bond yields, and if the thirty-year yield spikes to 5%, then Cramer believes \u201cthat will start interfering with this tech rally that seems to be motivated by a lot of analysts coming out and saying this is the time, there\u2019s now reacceleration in tech spend.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also speculated on what Jensen Huang might end up talking about at CES later in the day. He stated \u201cI think that one of the things that Jensen is going to talk about today are all the new use cases. This is tonight\u2019s CES talk. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we start hearing about robots. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we didn\u2019t hear a lot about Tesla. Tesla and self-driving cars. Tesla and the neural network that is based on NVIDIA!\u201d\n\nAlong with industrial and material stocks, another sector that\u2019s caught Cramer\u2019s attention is banks. Mentioning a recent investment bank note about the sector he believes that \u201cone of the groups that I think we have to focus on, there\u2019s a really interesting, uh, Barclays piece on the banks. Darkest before dawn. Raising the group for the first time since 2019, emphasis here on Citi.\u201d\n\nCramer also outlined that while technology valuations might appear to be overstretched, this isn\u2019t the case with banks. He shared \u201cThis is a group that when you look at it, they\u2019re selling at 11 times 2026 numbers. So the idea that you have this valuation problem in the market, well look at these stocks! There\u2019s no valuation problem with materials. Or with banks.\u201d He added \u201cThe valuation problem is with the stuff that keeps getting upgraded, which is enterprise software. So there\u2019s a little duplicitous nature among the top people who work at these firms because they should be saying look, there are two markets. There\u2019s the inexpensive market and we\u2019re warming up to it, and the expensive market, and we don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on Monday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nLinde plc (NASDAQ:LIN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 63\n\nLinde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) is a British industrial gas company that has gained prominence primarily because of its presence in the hydrogen market. The shares are up by a lackluster 3.26% over the past year since high interest rates have sapped the shine out of clean energy stocks. Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) has also suffered due to an industrial slowdown which has impacted its broader product portfolio. Cramer\u2019s comments about the firm were part of his remarks about the broader interest rate-driven weakness in the industrial and materials sectors. Here is what he said:\n\n\u201cWell I mean, clean energy, hydrogen is Linde. Now Linde was recommended this morning. A club name that by the way has just been one of the great performers of the year, but has like all the materials companies, has gone down! The materials companies are, again I\u2019m focused on them because that\u2019s [the] real economy. And the real economy is quite weak. So for those in the Fed who want to talk about how we\u2019re worried about inflation, again they should be saying we\u2019re worried about inflation in \u2018the\u2019. Because if they\u2019re worried about inflation in the data center, well I mean the data center costs are actually coming down because that\u2019s basically steel and old technology that is doing quite well. But if you look at Linde I mean that\u2019s a company that I expect to have revenue growth. It hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s just had tremendous margin expansion. And yet you can\u2019t give, you know, no one wants that stock. You can\u2019t give it away.\u201d\n\nOverall, LIN ranks 15th on our list of stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of LIN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LIN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Close to a year ago, the Portage Lake district library started a new book club. The silent book club doesn\u2019t function like a typical book club though. Twice a month the library brings people together to offer spaces to read whatever they want. Library director Katrina Linde-Moriarty says she found out about the concept while online.\n\nIt\u2019s an international program that you can have a local chapter of and invites people to go and read at spaces that may not always have readers in. \u2013 Katrina Linde-Moriarty, Library Director, Portage Lake District Library\n\nShe quickly contacted local businesses in the area, settling on the Keweenaw Brewing Company to set up an evening for an adult silent book club.\n\nAnd like you know is there a day of the week that\u2019s slower for use because I wanted to promote local business and local commerce as well. They said that Mondays in the evening are pretty slow and that\u2019s the day that we selected and we\u2019ve been going on now strong for a bit over a year and a half at that location. \u2013 Katrina Linde-Moriarty, Library Director, Portage Lake District Library\n\nAnd began inviting teens to the library for their book club.\n\nBut we wanted to create a space for teens to explore reading as well outside of school, outside of their required reading, and allow them to talk with their peers about the things that they like. So we have that one here at the library, but we provide pizza, which I think is pretty cool. \u2013 Katrina Linde-Moriarty, Library Director, Portage Lake District Library\n\nThe Portage Lake district library silent book clubs for adults and teens will start up again for 2025 next week. The adult book club at the Keweenaw Brewing Company taproom will start at 6 pm on Monday. Teens will take over the teen readers area of the library from 4 to 5 pm on Tuesday. The teen\u2019s club will also have refreshments available during the event. Those interested in signing up for a Portage Lake District library card or want to learn more about the library\u2019s programs can find more details online.\n\nSilent Book Club\n\nWhen: Monday, January 13, 6:00 \u2013 7:30 pm (Monthly on the fourth Monday)\n\nLooking for a book club without the pressure of assigned reading? The Silent Book Club is the ideal solution. Bring your book and join fellow readers at Keweenaw Brewing Company for a quiet reading session followed by a relaxed social period. Read quietly for 45 minutes, then share your thoughts or simply enjoy the company of fellow book lovers. Open to all ages; minors must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.\n\nSilent Book Club: TEEN EDITION\n\nWhen: Tuesday, January 14, 4:00 \u2013 5:00 pm (Monthly on the second Tuesday)\n\nJoin our Silent Book Club just for teens! Read a book of your choice, followed by a social period to share what you\u2019re reading. Refreshments will be provided!",

But before that, he previously competed alongside another F1 driver, as Lawson and Alexander Albon used to race together in the DTM. The driver from New Zealand explained to Auto, Motor und Sport that he still has plans with Albon.\n\nLawson and Albon in the DTM\n\nIn 2021, Lawson raced in Formula 2, while After Albon was replaced by Sergio Perez, he became Red Bull's reserve driver. During this time, Lawson and Albon became teammates and raced together in the German series, DTM, as a result of Red Bull's decisions.\n\nWhile racing in the series that year, the driver from New Zealand won three races. Lawson narrowly missed out on the title as, at the final race of the season, he was the championship leader. Unfortunately, he had an incident with Kelvin van der Linde. After the race finished, Lawson said Van der Linde was the \"dirtiest guy I have ever raced against\".\n\nLawson and Albon want to buy a house together\n\nHowever, Lawson still has incredible memories from that year. Together with Albon, they visited the Nurburgring several times. They loved that area so much that they once talked about buying a house together in the past so that they could drive there all the time. Lawson would still like to do exactly that.\n\nHe said, \"We talked about it a few years ago, and I want to keep the idea going. It's a really cool place. We used to go there regularly when we were both racing in the DTM. Then we went to the Nordschleife in road cars. We had a simple VW Golf and a Citro\u00ebn C3 and stayed in touch via Bluetooth and WhatsApp calls. We overtook a BMW M2 and all the other sporty cars. To be honest, it was really one of the funniest things I've ever done in a car.\"\n\nThis article was written in collaboration with Cas van de Kleut.\n\nWant more Formula 1?

Titans cricket sensation Dewald Brevis put the visiting team in a strong position with the bat, smashing 57 off 29 balls, including 6 sixes and 2 fours. Delano Potgieter scored an unbeaten 25, while the in-form Proteas all-rounder George Linde contributed an unbeaten 23.\n\nDewald Brevis. Photo: Cricinfo\n\nEngland\u2019s Richard Gleeson was the pick of the Sunrisers bowlers with figures of 2/22 in his four overs, while Proteas left-arm seamer Marco Jansen took 2/38.\n\nThe former North West Dragons all-rounder Potgieter then delivered a career-best bowling performance, taking 5/10 in 3 overs as the Sunrisers were bowled out for a mere 77 runs in 15 overs. This included tanking three wickets in the 11th over when he dismissed Beyers Swanepoel, David Bedingham, and Aiden Markram.\n\nThe legendary New Zealand left-arm seamer Trent Boult, in turn, set the tone early, removing the English duo of Zak Crawley and Tom Abell with consecutive balls in the third over. Boult finished with impressive figures of 2/16 in 3 overs.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunrisers\u2019 regular captain, Markram, top-scored for the home team with 19 before being dismissed by Potgieter. Jansen, in turn, managed to score 14 before being run out by MI Cape Town and Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan.\n\nFollowing the match, Potgieter reflected on his man-of-the-match performance, saying he focused on keeping things simple with the ball.\n\n\u201cStanding at the top of my mark, I just said, \u2018I\u2019m going to try to hit the top of the stumps,\u2019 and fortunately for me, it worked out perfectly,\u201d said Potgieter.\n\nDelano Potgieter celebrates three wickets in one over.

For me, I always feel that if whatever I do first comes off nicely, I gain a lot more confidence going into the other skills during the match.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday at 17:30, the Joburg Super Kings will face MI Cape Town at the Wanderers in Johannesburg.

Breathe Deep is the East End\u2019s newest community event combining yoga, breathwork, and ice baths, with a place to unwind, reconnect, and recharge.\n\n\n\nThis FREE once-monthly event kicks off on Saturday, January 11th at 6:30am at Linde Reserve in Stepney, and is an opportunity for you to step away from the chaos and reconnect with yourself.\n\n\u201cHeld at Linde Reserve in Stepney, this event is an invitation to rise with the sun, move with purpose, and ground yourself in nature. Ice baths, provided by Primal Ice, add an extra layer of recovery and resilience,\u201d said co-founder Melinda Milky.\n\nIn creating Breathe Deep, Melinda is joined by Anastasia Matryoshka and Sam Barnett. Their mission for this event is to provide accessible wellness experiences for everyone, at no cost.\n\nTo begin, the focus will be on simply breathing to calm the mind and centre focus. Breathing is one of the greatest tools for finding inner peace, and once learned, becomes accessible to everyone, anytime, anywhere.\n\nFrom there, you will move your body and find your balance, whilst being guided through a gentle yoga flow suitable for all skill levels. This is aimed at connecting your body with your mind.\n\nFinally, embrace the calm in the cold of an ice bath. This mindful practice works to reset your nervous system and strengthen your connection to the present moment.\n\nMost importantly, Breathe Deep is not just about personal growth, but about building collective connection. Whether you go by yourself, with a friend, or even a group, this will be a welcoming space to meet with new people, while growing alongside each other.\n\nSponsoring the event are the popular local patisserie Mascavado and Fast Twitch Australia!

            "content": "Kelvin van der Linde went into the final weekend at Hockenheim with a 15-point deficit. After Friday\u2019s free practice sessions, he didn\u2019t think he had much of a chance of catching championship leader Mirko Bortolotti in the Lamborghini. However, rain before the first qualifying session led to a wet track, on which the ABT driver secured pole position with a perfect lap. With a hard-fought victory in Saturday\u2019s race, the German-South African sensationally regained the lead in the standings.\n\nBut on a dry track on Sunday, van der Linde had no chance against the Lamborghinis. He lost the lead in the standings again to Mirko Bortolotti who secured a commanding pole position and went on to build a half-minute gap over van der Linde in the race.\n\nRicardo Feller managed to qualify third on Sunday, making a mark at the end of a difficult DTM season for him. In the early stages of the race, he was third behind Bortolotti and eventual winner Luca Englster. However, after the mandatory pit stop, the Swiss driver briefly ran off the track on cold tyres, meaning he had to settle for sixth place.\n\nFor the team, it was the last race with the Audi R8 LMS GT3 evo II before the upcoming switch to Lamborghini. With the R8, ABT Sportsline celebrated a total of eleven victories between 2021 and 2024. After third places for Kelvin van der Linde (2021), Ren\u00e9 Rast (2022) and Ricardo Feller (2023), ABT Sportsline took the runner-up position with Kelvin van der Linde this time missing the drivers\u2019 title by just 17 points. ABT Sportsline also secured second place in the teams\u2019 championship.\n\nThe 2025 DTM season begins at Oschersleben on the last weekend of April. From next year, Germany\u2019s most important racing series will be powered by synthetic fuel.\n\nMartin Tomczyk (ABT Motorsport Director): \u201cIt was clear that we were competing at the absolute limit with the Audi this year. I\u2019m proud that we still managed to achieve a lot of success and keep the championship open until the last race. On Saturday, we once again made the most of our opportunities. On Sunday, unfortunately, we lacked the performance to keep up with the Lamborghini. Missing out on the title by such a small margin is hard for the team. But it was a thrilling fight \u2013 unfortunately with the wrong outcome for us. Nevertheless, congratulations to Mirko Bortolotti, SSR Performance and Lamborghini! We will come back stronger next year. I\u2019m already looking forward to that!\u201d\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Saturday 1st/Sunday 12th, 32 points/Championship 2nd, 221 points): \u201cIt was a very long season that sapped a lot of energy. We really got everything out of the Audi and only made a few mistakes. Everyone in the team can be proud of this performance, even if in the end it is not the result we had hoped for.\u201d\n\nRicardo Feller (Saturday 12th, Sunday 6th, 14 points, Championship 11th, 115 points): \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that the season is already over. I could have done better. Fortunately, I was able to make a mark in the last qualifying session, but looking at the season as a whole, I can\u2019t be satisfied \u2013 especially after we fought for the title last year.\u201d",

            "content": "Air Products\u0092 (NYSE: APD) Board of Directors today issued the following statement in response to Mantle Ridge\u0092s Shareholder letter, issued today:\n\n\n\nMantle Ridge is proposing that Air Products be controlled by Mantle Ridge\u0092s hand-picked candidates for CEO and Chairman. This should be troubling to all Air Products shareholders for the following reasons:\n\nMantle Ridge Chairman nominee Dennis Reilley has not held a management position in 18 years and would be coming into a company and industry that have undergone tremendous change in the last two decades, thereby rendering any \u0093experience\u0094 that he has as stale.\n\nMantle Ridge\u0092s choice for CEO is Eduardo Menezes, who has never been a public company CEO, only had responsibility for one region when he worked at Linde, and, as acknowledged by Mantle Ridge, was passed over for CEO at Linde.\n\nMantle Ridge apparently has so little confidence in Mr. Menezes that it did not nominate him as a candidate for the Board and evidently believes he would only succeed if he were paired with Mr. Reilley.\n\nMantle Ridge has made outlandish claims that Messrs. Reilley and Menezes are responsible for Linde\u0092s total shareholder return between 2000 and 2024; however, Mr. Reilley left Linde in 2007, and Mr. Menezes left Linde in 2021, and only ran part of the business for part of that time.\n\nMantle Ridge\u0092s substandard slate also includes two other nominees, Tracy McKibben and Andrew Evans, whose credentials pale in comparison to the experience of current Board directors and are inferior to the backgrounds of Air Products\u0092 new independent director candidates, Bhavesh V. (\u0093Bob\u0094) Patel and Alfred Stern, seasoned executives with experience leading major publicly listed industrial companies. Ms. McKibben\u0092s energy experience stems largely from running what appears to be her own small investment and consulting firm, while Mr. Evans\u0092 industry experience has been limited to the U.S.\n\nNotably, Mantle Ridge promises to bring the \u0093highest ethical standards\u0094 to Air Products when Mr. Reilley, their candidate for Chair and half of the so-called \u0093Dream Team,\u0094 is alleged to have leaked confidential information from three public company boards while a member of those boards to a neighbor, who testified to this under oath, leading to a widely reported insider trading scandal. A leading reporter said this behavior \u0093will be disqualifying in many investors\u0092 eyes, and it\u0092s hard to see how Mantle Ridge \u0096 which says it knew about the allegations before it nominated Reilley \u0096 got comfortable\u0094 1 . Based on this alleged conduct, the Air Products Board believes Mr. Reilley should never again sit on a public company board.\n\n. Based on this alleged conduct, the Air Products Board believes Mr. Reilley should never again sit on a public company board. Air Products\u0092 Board thoroughly vetted Mantle Ridge\u0092s director nominees, with the assistance of a leading national search firm, and both the Board and the firm found them to be inferior to our current directors and our two new nominees, Bhavesh V. (\u0093Bob\u0094) Patel and Alfred Stern.\n\nThe fact remains that Air Products, under its current Board and Mr. Ghasemi\u0092s leadership, has created $44 billion of shareholder value 2 and an 11% Adjusted EPS CAGR since 2014 3 .\n\nand an 11% Adjusted EPS CAGR since 2014 . With Air Products shareholders supporting our nominations of Mr. Patel and Mr. Stern at the 2025 Annual Meeting, six out of nine Directors will have been first elected in the last five years. This new Board will oversee a rigorous CEO succession process already underway and has committed to providing an announcement of a new President and related timeline for CEO succession no later than March 31, 2025.\n\nThe Air Products Board strongly urges shareholders to vote their shares \u0093FOR\u0094 ONLY Air Products\u0092 nominees. Please discard any blue proxy card received from Mantle Ridge.\n\n1Liz Hoffman, Semafor, December 13, 2024\n\n2Based on $25.2B market capitalization on June 30, 2014 (one day prior to Mr. Ghasemi\u0092s first day as CEO) and December 13, 2024\n\n3Non-GAAP financial measure.

            "content": "If you live with or have lost a loved one to Alzheimer\u2019s disease you may find yourself with an inbox filled with well-intentioned emails from family and friends, about the latest research on Alzheimer\u2019s disease or the new cure that drug companies don\u2019t want you to know about. A recent New York Times article hits a bit differently. Linde Jacobs is a woman in her 30s with two young daughters. Four weeks ago, she lost her mother to frontal temporal dementia (FTD) and the article begins with her waiting to hear her genetic test result, that is whether she has a mutant gene that will cause in her the same disease that afflicted her mother. She learns she does, meaning she will likely develop FTD, and that her daughters have 50-50 chance as well.\n\nThe article highlights the remarkable journey of a woman determined to do everything she can to stop her family\u2019s devastating pattern of FTD. She presents her family\u2019s story at scientific conferences, inspires scientists to study her family\u2019s mutant gene, donates skin cells for research, and creates a nonprofit to unite others who carry the same mutant gene so they can eventually join clinical trials.\n\nFTD causes a loss of brain cells, unique personality changes, and cognitive loss. Linde and some of her family members carry one of the mutant genes, called MAPT, that causes FTD. Scientists have discovered that being a carrier of MAPT means that there is a very high likelihood (nearly 99.9%) that a person will develop FTD, and a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene on to their children. MAPT is one of several mutant genes that can be passed on generation after generation in families with a history of young onset dementia.\n\nIn the Alzheimer\u2019s disease community, there is also a rare young onset hereditary form of the disease caused by gene mutations. This is known as autosomal dominant or familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease (FAD). Families with a mutation (genetic change or error) in the PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP genes often see multiple family members over generations develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease at a young age, typically between their 40s and 50s. Like Linde\u2019s story, these families wrestle with losing a parent at a young age, enduring frustrating diagnostic journeys, being caregivers for their parents while also taking care of young children, contemplating whether they would like to learn if they carry a mutant gene themselves, and dealing with possibility of passing the mutant gene onto their children, to name a few. Many of these FAD families are participating in clinical trials and helping to make groundbreaking discoveries about what causes the disease, what biomarkers can detect the disease sooner, and testing promising drugs (link to this: First Success Stories From Alzheimer\u2019s Secondary Prevention Trial | ALZFORUM).\n\nAs the Founder of Youngtimers, a nonprofit dedicated to helping these families (link to www.youngtimers.org), I often receive questions from individuals who are worried that their family may carry one of these FAD mutant genes. Information about the autosomal dominant vs sporadic forms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is critical for these families.\n\nThe criteria for determining whether your family\u2019s history of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is autosomal dominant is the following:\n\nAt least two family members in two successive generations (so a parent and their child) developed symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease before the age of 60.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: If a family member has undergone genetic counseling and testing and found to be a carrier of a mutation in the PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP genes, this is a confirmation that your family member has FAD and has a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to children.\n\nIf your family doesn\u2019t fit these criteria, it is likely that your family is not at risk of carrying a mutant gene that causes FAD. Most people with dementia have or had a sporadic form of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. While researchers are still trying to understand the genetics behind sporadic Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the strongest genetic risk factor for this disease is APOE4. Unlike FAD, in which people who test positive for a genetic mutation have a near 99.9% chance of getting the disease, people who carry one or two copies of the APOE4 gene have a 2-15 fold increased risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It increases risk but does not cause the disease. Some people who have two copies of APOE4 live to 100 and never develop Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nLosing a loved one to Alzheimer\u2019s disease or any dementia is devastating. I lost my dad to Alzheimer\u2019s disease when I was in my 20s and he was in his 50s. I carry that loss with me even 15 years after his passing. But it has also fueled incredible motivation and passion for finding a cure, for stepping into the lab each and every day, and for starting Youngtimers. We are here. Scientists who have lost loved ones, who care, who are inspired by your stories. We are not sitting on the sidelines, but doing the work so that in the future, no one has to lose a loved one to this disease again. So please don\u2019t hesitate to send that email. Share your story with us. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve dedicated our careers and countless hours in dark rooms looking under microscopes to. We\u2019re in this together.",

The 33-year-old Frijns is not new to BMW M Motorsport. He drove the #20 M Hybrid V8 for BMW M Team WRT in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) Hypercar class last year, driving with Sheldon van der Linde and Ren\u00e9 Rast.\n\nLike many other pro racing drivers, Frijns first racing experience was in karting, and he got his start in single-seaters by competing in the Formula BMW Europe series in 2009 and 2010, winning the championship in 2010. He then started moving up the formula car ladder by competing in Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 and Formula Renault 3.5, winning championships in both series. His single-seater experience led him to reserve/test driver roles in Formula 1 with Sauber (2013) and Caterham (2014), and he\u2019s been driving in the Formula E championship since 2015, most recently with Envision Racing.\n\nFrijns had a prior relationship with BMW M Team WRT before joining them for the BMW program. He raced in the Blancpain GT series with WRT in an Audi and won championships there in 2015 and 2017. He also drove an LMP2 prototype for WRT in the FIA WEC series in 2021, 2022, and 2023 before going into the BMW Hypercar program in 2024. The versatile Frijns also competed in the DTM championship with Audi from 2018 through 2020, scoring three wins and ten podiums in 2020 to finish third in the championship.\n\nFrijns also won the N\u00fcrburgring 24-hour race in 2022, driving an Audi Sport Team Phoenix Audi R8 LMS GT3 Evo II. Two of his co-drivers in that car were Dries Vanthoor and Kelvin van der Linde. Vanthoor was also brought over from WRT as a BMW works driver before the 2024 season, and van der Linde (Sheldon\u2019s older brother) was just signed as a BMW factory driver for 2025 after several years as an Audi driver.\n\nFrijns will drive for BMW M Team WRT again in the FIA WEC in 2025, sharing the #20 M Hybrid V8 with Ren\u00e9 Rast and Sheldon van der Linde. Here in the US, Frijns will be joining BMW M Team RLL in the #25 car at the Daytona, Sebring, and Road Atlanta races with Sheldon van der Linde and Marco Wittmann (as well as Rast at Daytona). Frijns has little to no experience racing in the US. The only race he has competed in here before was the 2018 Rolex 24 at Daytona, driving an Oreca-07 Gibson in the Prototype class.\n\nThe 2025 Rolex 24 at Daytona will be held from January 22nd to 26th, followed by the 12 Hours of Sebring in mid-March.\n\n\u2014David Haueter\n\n[Photo courtesy BMW]",

This should be troubling to all Air Products shareholders for the following reasons:\n\nMantle Ridge Chairman nominee Dennis Reilley has not held a management position in 18 years and would be coming into a company and industry that have undergone tremendous change in the last two decades, thereby rendering any \"experience\" that he has as stale.\n\n\n\n\n\nMantle Ridge's choice for CEO is Eduardo Menezes, who has never been a public company CEO, only had responsibility for one region when he worked at Linde, and, as acknowledged by Mantle Ridge, was passed over for CEO at Linde.\n\n\n\n\n\nMantle Ridge apparently has so little confidence in Mr. Menezes that it did not nominate him as a candidate for the Board and evidently believes he would only succeed if he were paired with Mr. Reilley.\n\n\n\n\n\nMantle Ridge has made outlandish claims that Messrs. Reilley and Menezes are responsible for Linde's total shareholder return between 2000 and 2024; however, Mr. Reilley left Linde in 2007, and Mr. Menezes left Linde in 2021, and only ran part of the business for part of that time.\n\n\n\n\n\nMantle Ridge's substandard slate also includes two other nominees, Tracy McKibben and Andrew Evans, whose credentials pale in comparison to the experience of current Board directors and are inferior to the backgrounds of Air Products' new independent director candidates, Bhavesh V. (\"Bob\") Patel and Alfred Stern, seasoned executives with experience leading major publicly listed industrial companies. Ms. McKibben's energy experience stems largely from running what appears to be her own small investment and consulting firm, while Mr. Evans' industry experience has been limited to the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotably, Mantle Ridge promises to bring the \" highest ethical standards \" to Air Products when Mr. Reilley, their candidate for Chair and half of the so-called \"Dream Team,\" is alleged to have leaked confidential information from three public company boards while a member of those boards to a neighbor, who testified to this under oath, leading to a widely reported insider trading scandal. A leading reporter said this behavior \"will be disqualifying in many investors' eyes, and it's hard to see how Mantle Ridge \u2013 which says it knew about the allegations before it nominated Reilley \u2013 got comfortable\" 1 . Based on this alleged conduct, the Air Products Board believes Mr. Reilley should never again sit on a public company board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" to Air Products when Mr. Reilley, their candidate for Chair and half of the so-called \"Dream Team,\" is to have leaked confidential information from three public company boards while a member of those boards to a neighbor, who testified to this under oath, leading to a widely reported insider trading scandal. A leading reporter said this behavior \"will be disqualifying in many investors' eyes, and it's hard to see how Mantle Ridge \u2013 which says it knew about the allegations before it nominated Reilley \u2013 got comfortable\" . Based on this conduct, the Air Products Board believes Mr. Reilley should never again sit on a public company board. Air Products' Board thoroughly vetted Mantle Ridge's director nominees, with the assistance of a leading national search firm, and both the Board and the firm found them to be inferior to our current directors and our two new nominees, Bhavesh V. (\"Bob\") Patel and Alfred Stern.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact remains that Air Products, under its current Board and Mr. Ghasemi's leadership, has created $44 billion of shareholder value 2 and an 11% Adjusted EPS CAGR since 2014 3 .\n\n\n\n\n\nof shareholder value and an Adjusted EPS CAGR since 2014 . With Air Products shareholders supporting our nominations of Mr. Patel and Mr. Stern at the 2025 Annual Meeting, six out of nine Directors will have been first elected in the last five years. This new Board will oversee a rigorous CEO succession process already underway and has committed to providing an announcement of a new President and related timeline for CEO succession no later than March 31, 2025.\n\n___________________________________________ 1 Liz Hoffman, Semafor, December 13, 2024 2 Based on $25.2B market capitalization on June 30, 2014 (one day prior to Mr. Ghasemi's first day as CEO) and December 13, 2024 3 Non-GAAP financial measure.

Market update: Stocks are strongly higher to kick off the new week. The S & P 500 is looking to mark back-to-back sessions of 1% gains. However, a weak response to a $58 billion auction of 3-year Treasury notes caused interest rates to rise, which took a little bite out of the rally. The auction was the first of three key auctions over the next few days. Materials: The materials sector has been awful over the past 3 months, falling 11% on concerns about a slowdown in China, continued softness in Europe, higher interest rates, and potential trade disruption from tariffs. There's been few winners in the group, with only 4 of the S & P 50 constituents up over this time period and three of them were paper packaging companies. But could there be other good houses in what has been a horrible neighborhood? Analysts at Mizuho shuffled up its top picks in a note Monday. They said investors should position their portfolios defensively right now, preferring downstream, asset light specialty chemical companies and electronic materials companies instead of asset heavy, upstream chemical companies. Two companies they highlighted on their top pick list were club names DuPont and Linde . Mizuho said DuPont is worth $110 on a sum-of-the-parts basis and the discount will narrow as the company progresses through the spin-off process. As for the Linde, they like how it's the global leader in industrial gases, which they call \"an unregulated utility-like industry with only 1 similarly positioned competitor.\" They also like how Linde's valuation has significantly declined due to the rotation into Air Products and Chemicals on an activist campaign. Although the Materials sector is off to a sluggish start to the new year, Mizuho's commentary reaffirmed that we are invested in the right areas of this tough group. We're a little more conservative with our Dupont SOTP math \u2013 we think the stock is worth $100 \u2013 but we agree with the thesis that it will trend closer to these levels as we get past this spin purgatory period. DuPont has been a major disappointment over the past few months but there is a catalyst to get the stock higher. And when we most recently added to our Linde position at a slightly higher price in mid-December , we pointed out how we are patiently waiting for the money flow to reverse from Air Products and Chemicals into Linde and for volumes to pick up again through clean energy and electronics growth. Up next: There are no major earnings Monday after the closing bell. The big event this evening is Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's keynote at the Consumer Electronic Show. It starts at 6:30 p.m. PT and we expect the presentation will focus on robotics. The key economic data points Tuesday are JOLTS Job Openings and ISM Services Index. We'll also be watching another big Treasury auction, $39 billion of 10-year notes at 1p.m. ET. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Additionally, the initial Q3 consensus earnings estimate suggests a potential gradual recovery in domestic corporate earnings, which could explain the domestic market's underperformance compared to global markets led by premium valuation,\" Nair added.Wall Street's major indexes were trading higher on Monday, fueled by optimism in AI-driven technology stocks and reports suggesting the incoming Trump administration may take a softer approach to tariffs than initially expected.Automakers rallied as Ford climbed 2.6% and General Motors advanced 2.8% following reports that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration plans to impose universal tariffs only on sectors critical to national or economic security. However, Trump later denied the report. Automobile manufacturers remain among the most exposed to U.S. trade tariffs due to their extensive supply chains.Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors posted gains, with tech stocks leading, up 1.6%.Chipmakers surged on Microsoft\u2019s $80 billion investment plan for AI-enabled data centers and Foxconn\u2019s better-than-expected Q4 revenue.

He was born on February 21, 1932, in DeForest, the son of Almer and Lorraine Linde.\n\nBud was a Deforest fixture his entire life, attending DeForest Schools, lettering in football, baseball, boxing and FFA, Graduating from DeForest High School in 1950. Bud married his high school sweetheart Evonne Reddeman on July 28th, 1951, at Bethel Lutheran Church in Madison (Norway Grove Church was under construction) officiated by Pastor Kampen.\n\nBud was a \u201cjack-of-all-trades\u201d but most passionate about farming with his dad Almer and his brother Wray. The \u201cboys\u201d created the Linde Brothers partnership in 1946 and worked together their entire lives raising livestock and managing hundreds of acres in crops.\n\nBud was a very active, lifelong member of Norway Grove Lutheran Church. His membership spanned 92 years, the longest of any member (so far). He readily volunteered at the church in every way, from Church Council to mowing the cemetery.\n\nAny description of Bud must bring to light his everlasting generosity. Be it relative, neighbor or stranger, if help was needed Bud would be there with his pick-up, his tools, his wisdom, his strength and if necessary, his checkbook. His home was always open to friends and strangers alike.\n\nThroughout his life, Bud would grab his hunting gear or tackle box at every opportunity. He may have been happiest sitting in his boat, showing amazing patience teaching his grandkids to fish. Bud loved hosting his friends and family at the Crooked Horn Cabin, and would regale his guests with hunting and fishing stories around the euchre table well into the night.\n\nBud is survived by his wife of 72 years, \u201cGramma Bud\u201d Evonne, son Donald (Cheri), daughters Lou Anne Schweppe (Greg), Lori Linde (David Woolpert) and Lisa Linde.

            "content": "2018 was a great year for gaming, especially with the release of Red Dead Redemption 2. Fans have spent the last seven years playing the iconic Western prequel. While more graphically impressive games have been released since then, it would be a disservice to undermine what Rockstar Games achieved with this project.\n\nAd\n\nAlthough plenty of exciting next-gen titles are supposed to come later this year, most don't have a confirmed release date. Well, if the prolonged wait is making fans impatient, they should fill the void with some Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 Is a Timeless Masterpiece\n\nLive as an Outlaw in Red Dead Redemption 2 (Image via Rockstar Games)\n\nRockstar Games didn\u2019t hold back when working on this ambitious project, making Red Dead Redemption 2 their most immersive title to date. Most fans and critics anticipated it to be a masterclass in game development even before its release, and early reviews didn\u2019t disappoint. Despite the slow pace of the first chapter in the mountains of Colter, the story immediately pulls fans into the shoes of Arthur Morgan.\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\nMost were unsure how to feel knowing that John Marston, the original protagonist of the first Red Dead Redemption, wouldn\u2019t be the main character. The developers challenged themselves to introduce a new protagonist that could rival Marston\u2019s vigor and charm, and it is safe to say they have succeeded with Roger Clark\u2019s compelling performance as Arthur Morgan.\n\nThe slow opening was cleverly placed to teach players some basic gameplay features like hunting, tracking, and gunplay. Moreover, armed with the most advanced version of the studio's proprietary game engine, the physics appeared more realistic than ever, and it was a major upgrade from its predecessor.\n\nAd\n\nEverything About Red Dead Redemption 2 Is Worth Admiring\n\nThe wildlife in Red Dead Redemption 2 feels authentic (Image via Rockstar Games)\n\nUnlike previous Rockstar titles, Red Dead Redemption 2 has an incredibly grounded and impactful story filled with powerful character moments that left most fans bawling by the end of Chapter 6. The story is about honor and might even change a player's outlook on life. The honor system from the first game also made a comeback and solely relies on how a player\u2019s actions affect the world.\n\nAd\n\nAd\n\nRandom encounters, in the form of kidnappings, armed robberies, attempted murders, and other activities also contributed to the honor system. These were events players came across when exploring the open world, and the way they reacted changed their honor level.\n\nFurthermore, the attention to detail in Arthur's apparel affected gameplay quite significantly. Players were required to observe their environment and pack appropriate clothing to avoid any negative effects. Naturally, all these came together to make Red Dead Redemption 2 one of the most immersive games of recent years.\n\nAd\n\nConclusion\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 will be remembered as one of those games that can be replayed in 2025 and beyond. The developers invested nearly a decade of their lives in making this Western tale a reality and the universal praise it received from fans and critics alike is well-deserved.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "content": "Rabbi Moshe Davis, a native of Chicago, made aliyah with his wife and four children in 2020 after 20 years of service as a rabbi for Jewish communities in the United States. He lives in Beit Shemesh and works for the Israel Defense and Security Forum (IDSF), an organization known in Hebrew as Habithonistim, which guides the narrative of Israel\u2019s national security needs.\n\n\u201cI made aliyah during COVID from South Carolina after a wonderful career in the American rabbinate. I often tell people that I\u2019m the only rabbi I know who made the transition from Torah to national security,\u201d he tells The Jerusalem Report.\n\n\u201cAt the IDSF, my title is Director of International Operations. I am responsible for building our communications to the English-speaking community and developing strategic partners and a donor base in North America.\u201d\n\nWhat is the IDSF?\n\nThe IDSF was established in 2020 by Brig.-Gen. (res.) Amir Avivi after 30 years of service in the IDF.\n\n\u201cHe founded the organization to focus solely on Israel\u2019s national security, guiding decisions that protect its citizens and ensure their safety. It sounds simple, but no one else was doing this or is currently doing this. During his time in the military, General Avivi was involved in some high-level decisions where he experienced firsthand how professional national security recommendations were cast aside for political and alternate motivations, thereby jeopardizing the lives of the people of Israel. He saw how an uninformed public, imprudent media, and misguided security professionals contributed to national security vulnerabilities and failures. And so the IDSF was formed to change the narrative. Since October 7, 2023, the IDSF has emerged as the leading voice in national security strategy in Israel, advocating for a decisive victory. We provide guidance to governments in Israel and abroad on critical military decision-making, while also educating society to foster resilience and understand its vital role in ensuring national security.\u201d Rabbi Moshe Davis. (credit: Courtesy)\n\nHow does Rabbi Davis see the situation in Israel today?\n\n\u201cI am incredibly optimistic. At the beginning of the war, everything looked bleak. The people of Israel experienced the greatest tragedy of our generation, and the pain was palpable 24/7. Beyond the emotional and visceral reaction, there was a great fear of the unknown. The ordinary people of Israel stepped up, truly demonstrating that our nation is extraordinary. Young soldiers, reservists, and volunteers from Israel and abroad came together in a way that can only be likened to messianic times.\u201d\n\nHe adds that we have come a long way since the war began, and the Middle East is a different place today: \u201cHamas in Gaza is nearly eradicated, the decades-long threat from Hezbollah is virtually nonexistent, the Assad regime has fallen, and Iran has tried its best to launch direct strikes on Israel and has failed every time. The balance of power in the Shia-Sunni world is shifting, the Israeli-Saudi relationship is strengthening, and the new US administration looks promising in terms of addressing the threat from Iran. All we need now is to focus on strengthening the unity in Israel, which was so strong after October 7.\u201d\n\nOne of the rabbi\u2019s roles is to host daily war briefings, which run Monday to Thursday at 10 a.m. Eastern time. \u201cThe goal is to share real analysis about what is happening in this war on both the battlefield and in the geopolitical arena. Viewers can send in their questions, and I do my very best to incorporate them into the briefings. The briefings are free of charge, and registration can be done with the link http://bit.ly/IDSFlive.

Twenty-three out of 33 portfolio names delivered third-quarter reports were deemed good or great by the Investing Club, thanks partly to a still-strong consumer and largely to the massive build out of all things AI. Case in point: In the S & P 500, 86% of technology companies beat sales estimates for the third quarter, according to FactSet data. That was followed by healthcare (79%) and real estate (74%). Communication services led all sectors for bottom-line beats, with 95%, followed by technology, at 86%. Two big moves to note. We initiated a position in Goldman Sachs after the financial name reported third-quarter results \u2014 we obviously liked what we saw on the release and heard from management \u2014 so it isn't included in this report. Also excluded is Advanced Micro Devices , which we exited Dec. 31 after the chipmaker reported lackluster results and gave little reason to stick with it into the new year. As always, we're wrapping up the season with a review of results for all Club holdings. These quarterly report cards are not the end-all, be-all for analysis. However, we believe stock prices ultimately follow the underlying business fundamentals of companies and having an idea of which companies did well and which didn't can help with buying and selling decisions. Similar to prior quarters, we grouped company results into one of four categories. The companies in each category are listed in alphabetical order. The Great The Good The Not So Bad The Ugly The Great Alphabet \"Listening to the post-earnings conference call made one thing abundantly clear: Artificial intelligence is being woven into every aspect of this company and, in turn, driving more engagement from both consumers and enterprise customers alike. It's not just revenue that AI is helping to grow, it's also helping the company become more efficient than ever.\" \u2014 Oct. 29 after the bell Amazon \"[The company] reported a much better-than-expected third quarter Thursday, with strong growth across online sales, its cloud business and advertising. Margin initiatives lead to soaring profits. Additionally, the fourth-quarter forecast was exactly what was needed to keep investors happy.\" \u2014 Oct. 31 after the bell (Amazon is a core holding in the Club's portfolio; one of 12 stocks with this designation.) Broadcom \"The headline numbers for the August-to-October quarter may have been mixed, but make no mistake, this was a very strong report. You wouldn't understand just how strong, though, unless you listened to the earnings call. It is the latest example to support Jim Cramer's long-held investing principle that investors need to wait for the call before making a post-earnings trade.\" \u2014 Dec. 12 after the bell (We exited Advanced Micro Devices on Dec. 31 because companies want custom AI chips from Broadcom and others if they can't get Nvidia.) BlackRock \"The firm posted third-quarter earnings that crushed analysts' expectations, yet again. Management also announced that assets under management reached another record high, an incredible $11.5 trillion, on surging inflows as the stock market rallied.\" \u2014 Oct. 11 before the bell (The Club called up the world's largest asset manager from the Bullpen and started a position on Oct. 16 .) Costco \"Costco shares are not cheap by traditional standards, trading at around 54 times next-12-months EPS estimates. The lofty valuation, however, hasn't stopped the stock's monstrous rise over the years. The stock is deserving of its hefty premium due to the company's share gains and dependability with a subscription model.\" \u2014 Dec. 12 after the bell (Costco is a core Club holding.) Disney \"It was a great quarter. Sales and earnings beat. The company generated strong cash flow. And perhaps most importantly for investors, its direct-to-consumer streaming unit's profitability was well ahead of the consensus estimate. And the good run should continue, with management forecasting earnings growth acceleration over the next couple of years.\" \u2014 Nov. 14 before the bell Meta Platforms \"[The company] delivered one heck of a strong third quarter and a current quarter revenue guide above expectations. \u2026 Fewer-than-expected daily active users in the quarter and bump higher in full-year capital expenditures guidance [were not concerning],\" \u2014 Oct. 30 after the bell (Meta is a core Club holding .)

In the trade alert, we wrote, \"We plan to use our remaining Morgan Stanley shares as a source of funds to scale deeper into Goldman Sachs .\") Nvidia \"Nvidia reported a fantastic quarter \u2026 even if guidance for the current quarter came up a bit short of the loftiest expectations. \u2026 It's hard to complain about a beat-and-raise quarter just because the beat and raise wasn't as big as some craved.\" \u2014 Nov. 20 after the bell (Nvidia is one of two \"own it, don't trade it\" stocks in the portfolio. Apple is the other one . Both are among the Club's core holdings) Wells Fargo \"[The company] missed expectations on third-quarter revenue.

The Good Apple \"[The company] delivered a quarter that can only be described as much better than feared. It wasn't perfect, but it was pretty darn good. \u2026 We are once again reminded why it doesn't pay to try to game Apple's quarterly release. For all the fearmongering we have had to contend with over the past few weeks about just how horrendous this print was going to be, it ended up being a September quarter sales record for the world's greatest consumer technology company.\" \u2014 Oct. 31 after the bell Abbott Laboratories \"In its third quarter, Abbott Labs demonstrated why we wanted to stick with the stock in the face of legal battles that emerged earlier this year and spooked investors. \u2026 [The company] upped its earnings guidance for the third straight quarter.\" \u2014 Oct. 16 before the bell Bristol-Myers Squibb \"Third-quarter earnings and revenue that blew past Wall Street's expectations thanks to its blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis and a portfolio of drugs it expects to deliver long-term growth.\" \u2014 Oct. 31 before the bell (The Club called Bristol-Myers up from the Bullpen and started a position on Nov. 25 , encouraged by the company's FDA-approved drug Cobenfy, the first novel treatment for schizophrenia in over 30 years.) CrowdStrike \"CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz noted on the [fiscal 2025 third quarter] earnings release that the company has realized a gross retention rate of over 97%, an important factor given investor concerns about customers leaving the platform following a botched software update back in July that caused a global IT outage. Since the glitch, Kurtz and his team have put on a master class in addressing the company's misstep \u2014 and as the fiscal third-quarter results show, it appears to be resonating with customers.\" \u2014 Nov. 26 after the bell DuPont \"DuPont's performance on profitability metrics shined, with the better-than-expected operating EBITDA and earnings results for the quarter compounded by an increase to management's full-year outlook on both metrics. Profit margin performance was also strong, as was cash flow generation, with transaction-adjusted free cash flow conversion of 130% \u2014 a sign of healthy earnings.\" \u2014 Nov. 5 before the bell Danaher \"Investors [on the earnings release] questioned the sustainability and magnitude of bioprocessing improvements in 2025. Wall Street's reaction [then] does not reflect the strides Danaher made in that important end-market, which is contained in the company's biotechnology segment.\" \u2014 Oct. 22 before the bell (Danaher is a core Club holding .) Home Depot \"High interest rates and economic uncertainty still weigh on Home Depot. But same store sales \u2014 a key metric in the retail space that seeks to adjust sales results for new store opening or closings \u2014 while down from a year ago, did show improvement in the U.S. and globally. The company raising its guidance is another reason to stay positive.\" \u2014 Nov. 12 before the bell (Home Depot is a core Club holding .) Linde \"It wasn't the typical beat-and-raise quarter that Linde has become known for over the years. However, its profits growing faster than sales shows how adept the company is at navigating tough economic conditions. Once economic activity picks up \u2013 perhaps from lower interest rates around the globe \u2013 and volumes grow again, we expect Linde will be back to its usual beat-and-raise cadence.\" \u2014 Oct. 31 before the bell (Linde is a core Club holding .) Microsoft \"[Despite] positive trends and innovations, revenue guidance for next quarter fell a touch short of expectations. That's a no-no in this market that needs beats and raises to send stocks higher, especially for a stock where there is still some investor frustration on whether these big AI bets will pay off.\" \u2014 Oct. 30 after the bell Nextracker \"Arguably the best part of Nextracker's report was the increase in its backlog \u2014 even more so than the revenue and earnings beats. Why? Because questions about Nextracker's backlog overshadowed stronger-than-expected headline results in August.\" \u2014 Oct. 30 after the bell Palo Alto Networks \"The cybersecurity company delivered strong fiscal 2025 first-quarter results, beating estimates on basically every line. It also raised full-year guidance across several key metrics. \u2026 The cybersecurity company delivered strong fiscal 2025 first-quarter results, beating estimates on basically every line. It also raised full-year guidance across several key metrics.\" \u2014 Nov. 20 after the bell Salesforce \"Wall Street is willing to look past Salesforce's slight miss on adjusted EPS because of the upbeat revenue performance.

            "content": "Have you drunk anything through a straw recently? If so, you\u2019ve got beer to thank. It\u2019s believed that the Sumerians \u2013 the oldest known civilisation, 7,000 years ago \u2013 invented the device so they could drink beer straight from the pot in which it brewed. Lifting the pot would have disturbed the grain that was still there, and no one wants a mouthful of that.\n\nSome straws found from the period are so long that they\u2019d have allowed eight people around the same pot at the same time.\n\nA lady enjoying a goblet of beer\n\nIf you think 7,000 years is a long time, Jonny Garrett\u2019s highly readable history of beer has only just got started.\n\nThe drink dates back 6,000 years beyond that, first appearing in (very) ancient Israel, around the same time that bread was first baked (which fits, as both products are made with grain and water). This makes beer older than wine or spirits.\n\nWorkers on the Great Pyramid of Giza were given ten pints a day each (don\u2019t worry \u2013 it was much weaker back then). Beer appears in the Bible, Proverbs 31 declaring: \u2018Let beer be for those who are perishing.\u2019\n\nAnd the ancient poem The Epic Of Gilgamesh lists beer as one of the things that makes us human, the others being sex, food and oil rubs. Each to their own.\n\nGarrett\u2019s brief takes him from social history to science, by way of copyright law. Bass\u2019s red triangle was the first trademark registered for legal protection in the UK, in 1875. If you\u2019ve an Irish passport, look at the cover\u2019s harp. It faces left. It has to: Guinness trademarked the harp facing right.\n\nThe Meaning of Beer is available now from the Mail Bookshop\n\nFor centuries beer was brewed by monks, including in Munich, where there were so many that the city\u2019s name means \u2018where the monks are\u2019. But when large-scale industry got involved in the 19th century, technological innovations appeared. The first fridge (as in the modern type, using compressed gas) was perfected by a German brewery to keep its product cold.\n\nAs Barrett says, \u2018the next time someone asks why your food fridge is full of beer, ask them why their beer fridge is full of food\u2019. Before such wonders, companies had to dig out cellars where they could store (\u2018lager\u2019 means warehouse in German) their beer at low temperatures. This is why Carlsberg built its first brewery on a hill , or \u2018berg\u2019. Carl was the founder\u2019s five-year-old son.\n\nThe professor who helped with the fridge, Carl von Linde, was also the first man to liquefy carbon dioxide, thereby allowing Guinness to add bubbles to its drink.\n\nThis led to Linde isolating oxygen and nitrogen from the air. The many uses of the former included pain relief in hospitals and a revolution in welding, while the latter is used in fertilisers. You really do start to believe Garrett when he says that beer built the world.",

            "content": "Linde\u2019s mother, Allison, had died just four weeks before, after a mutant gene gradually laid waste to her brain. In her 50s, Allison transformed from a joyful family ringleader into an impulsive, deceptive pariah. She drove like a maniac on cul-de-sacs. She pinched strangers, shoplifted craft supplies and stole money from her daughter.\n\nNow, on this morning in September 2021, Linde would find out if she had inherited the same vile genetic mutation.\n\nShe had a bad feeling. She and her mother had been so alike. Allison had been a physical therapist and Linde was a nurse. They were both doers \u2014 taking charge, mending wounds, planning theme parties. They were both chipper and a bit unfiltered, easy to a smirk or a four-letter word.\n\nShe probably gave me this, too, Linde thought.\n\nThe doctor finally popped up on the computer. Wasting no time on pleasantries, she shared her screen and zoomed in on one line of laboratory paperwork: POSITIVE.\n\nLinde was 33. Within about two decades, in all likelihood, her daughters would watch her become selfish, manipulative, reckless \u2014 the opposite of everything she\u2019d taught them to be. Just like Allison, Linde would turn into someone hard to tolerate, let alone love.\n\nAnd more insidious: Her girls and her two sisters each had a 50-50 chance of carrying the mutation. There was no cure for this disease, called frontotemporal dementia, nor even any treatments.\n\nSoon, Linde\u2019s husband, Taylor, pulled into the garage and opened the car door. He could hear her sobbing.\n\nThey loaded the 3-year-old into the car and went for a long drive around their Minneapolis suburb.\n\nLinde looked at Taylor. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel stuck with me,\u201d she said.\n\nLeaving had never crossed his mind. Allison\u2019s miserable experience, he told Linde, did not have to be hers. \u201cYou have all this time,\u201d he said. \u201cDo something about it.\u201d\n\nEven as they spoke, scientists were working on projects that might one day help her. Some had discovered how to cure grave conditions with gene editing. Others were tinkering with patients\u2019 skin cells to test experimental drugs. And pharmaceutical companies were developing new Alzheimer\u2019s therapies, one of which happened to target the rare defect in Linde\u2019s brain.\n\nLinde didn\u2019t know any of that yet. But she decided to take Taylor\u2019s advice. She would use the time she had, somehow, to find influential scientists and make them care about what was happening to her \u2014 and what might happen to her girls.\n\n\u2018Happy to help if I can\u2019",

Both characters are voiced by actor Benjamin Byron Davis, who compared and contrasted them in a recent interview with ComicBook. Asked which was \u201cthe bigger bastard,\u201d he admitted that he was biased toward the character he has spent more time with so far.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\n\u201cWell, I can go off the history of the character Rupert Thorne,\u201d he mused. \u201cI\u2019ll put it this way: I know Dutch a lot better than I know Rupert \u2014 at this point, who knows what the future holds. I think, honestly, my gut is telling me Rupert Thorne is a bigger bastard than Dutch. Dutch van der Linde, I think, has a code that\u2019s easier for me to get behind than Thorne. Thorne \u2014 I don\u2019t think that Thorne is as team-minded as Dutch thinks he is. Dutch definitely believes that he\u2019s being motivated by a very noble ambition, and I think that nobility and Rupert are not\u2026 Nobility might be for suckers in Rupert\u2019s world.\u201d\n\nPlay video\n\nDavis laughed as he reached this conclusion, but he went on to clarify that he was very familiar with the character of Rupert Thorne before taking the role itself. He said: \u201cI\u2019m a comic book nerd! Thorne is in my sweet spot. I knew, of course, John Vernon\u2019s work on the animated series and in the movies\u2026 and what had been established. I knew also the idea that he [Thorne] represented in the annals of Batman. As the character was transitioning with Denny O\u2019Neal, and then others, from the popular Adam West campy character and into the more modern Batman that we know, I think Thorne was a part of that editorial ambition\u2026 So, I\u2019m mindful of the character\u2019s history for sure.\u201d\n\nDavis knows his history well \u2014 Thorne made his DC Comics debut in 1977, and has become a very versatile villain for the publisher. He began as a corrupt politician in Gotham City with strong ties to organized crime, using blackmail and bribes to try and turn public opinion against Batman. He spent a lot of time in Blackgate Penitentiary over the decades, and although DC has seen a few major resets like the New 52 and Rebirth events, Thorne was still imprisoned last time he was shown in a comic in 2020.\n\nVernon\u2019s version of Thorne in Batman: The Animated Series stood in for many of the conventional crime bosses of Gotham City, and was notably involved in the creation of Two-Face in that series. Vernon reprised the role for the spinoff movie Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman. The character also appeared in Cartoon Network\u2019s The Batman in 2004, voiced by Victor Brandt, and in Batman: The Caped Crusader just last year where he was voiced by Cedric Yarbrough.\n\nCreature Commandos takes Thorne back to his roots by tying him closely to Doctor Phosphorus (Alexander Sartorius). Of course, things don\u2019t look good for Thorne in Thursday\u2019s episode of the series, but Davis still sounds hopeful for more screen time. There is one more episode to go in Creature Commandos\u2018 debut season, premiering on Thursday, January 9th on Max.",

            "content": "The lower volatility in the UK market presents compelling investment opportunities, particularly given its attractive dividend yields. The FTSE 100 offers a yield of 3.68%, while the FTSE 250, representing medium-sized UK firms, provides slightly lower but still appealing income prospects. This setup allows investors to explore higher-growth sectors, such as smaller companies while benefiting from rising dividends. According to BlackRock, UK dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, aligning with long-term inflation. Stocks that consistently grow their dividends often have stable cash flows, enabling them to increase payouts over time.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, presented a rather interesting take on the UK market's limited exposure to technology stocks. He pointed out that this reduced exposure has made the UK stock market less volatile compared to the US, where technology stocks are a key driver of market fluctuations. Mould observed that, despite its criticisms, the UK market experienced a relatively stable summer compared to the US, attributing this to differences in valuation and the relative expectations of the two markets.\n\nLindsay Matcham, involved in futures sales trading at Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, suggested that UK equities could appeal to investors seeking diversification. She noted that these stocks offer attractive valuations, strong dividend yields, and reduced concentration risk.\n\nThat said, investing in UK stocks can still be a worthwhile choice. While the UK market lacks significant technology companies, its equities in sectors like finance, energy, and mining provide diversification opportunities that complement the tech-heavy and highly valued US markets. In addition, the UK\u2019s index faces less risk from tariffs and trade restrictions. Goldman Sachs Research highlighted that UK equities could gain from various government measures, such as pension reforms aimed at boosting domestic investment in UK stocks and policies supporting homebuilding initiatives.\n\nIn recent years, investors have shown a preference for global stocks, particularly high-growth options like US technology companies, over UK equities. Over the past decade, the British index has achieved a 6% annual total return compared to 13% for the US broader market. Analysts suggest that this underperformance is partly due to weak earnings, domestic political instability, and the absence of a significant technology sector in the UK market. However, a notable factor is the sharp decline in valuations as investors have steered away from UK stocks. Goldman Sachs remarked that the challenge is not a lack of interest from foreign investors, who currently hold about two-thirds of the UK market capitalization, but rather the limited participation of domestic investors in UK equities.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the U.K. Dividend Champions List: 2024 Rankings by Yield . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) stands against the other U.K. dividend champions.\n\nStory Continues\n\nJanus Henderson\u2019s 2023 annual dividend report highlighted this upward trend, revealing that UK dividends reached approximately $86 billion in 2023, a significant rise from the $63.1 billion distributed in 2020. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best FTSE dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we reviewed the UK CCC Dividend list, which highlights UK companies with the longest histories of dividend growth. This list is based on the structure of David Fish\u2019s US Dividend Champions spreadsheet and serves as a useful tool to help identify and screen dividend growth stocks in the UK. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 29 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA scientist in a lab coat inspecting a cylinder filled with industrial gas.\n\nLinde plc (NASDAQ:LIN)\n\nDividend Yield as of December 29: 1.31%\n\nLinde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) is a global multinational chemical company that provides a wide range of gases to industries like healthcare, manufacturing, energy, food and beverage, chemicals, and electronics. Despite facing ongoing economic challenges in the third quarter, the company delivered impressive results, with a 9% increase in earnings per share (EPS), a rise in return on capital (ROC) to 25.8%, and a 130 basis point improvement in operating margins, reaching 29.6%. In addition to managing its short-term performance, the company secured its largest-ever gas sale project, boosting its project backlog to $10 billion. This milestone supports future growth in the industrial gas sector while upholding the company's disciplined investment approach. The stock has surged by nearly 3% in the past 12 months.\n\nIn Q3 2024, Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN)'s revenue came in at $8.4 billion, which showed a 2.46% growth from the same period last year. The revenue also surpassed analysts' expectations by $9.33 million. The company's operating profit amounted to $2.1 billion, with an operating profit margin of 25%. Mar Vista Investment Partners, LLC mentioned LIN in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cLinde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) is the world\u2019s largest, global industrial gas producer. The company enjoys the highest profit margins and returns on capital in the industry. Linde\u2019s primary products are atmospheric gases and process gases. Industrial gases have benefitted from secular growth trends in decarbonization and carbon sequestration. Moreover, the opportunity in blue and green ammonia and hydrogen are substantial. Projects in these areas are quickly being added to its backlog for future growth. We see these secular trends as long-term positives for Linde and the entire industrial gas industry.\n\nLinde plc (NASDAQ:LIN) is a reliable dividend payer, supported by its strong cash position. In the latest quarter, it reported an operating cash flow of $2.73 billion, an 8% increase from the previous year. Its free cash flow totaled $1.66 billion. During this period, the company returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. It has maintained a 31-year record of consistent dividend growth, offering a quarterly dividend of $1.39 per share. With a dividend yield of 1.31% as of December 29, LIN is one of the best FTSE dividend stocks on our list.\n\nAs of the close of Q3 2024, 63 hedge funds held stakes in Linde plc (NASDAQ:LIN), the same as in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey's database. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $3.6 billion.\n\nOverall LIN ranks 8th on our list of the U.K. dividend champions for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of LIN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LIN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.
