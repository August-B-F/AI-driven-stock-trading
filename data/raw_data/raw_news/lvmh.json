            "content": "Lately, Louis Vuitton has raised the stakes against dupes, the low-cost reproductions of its products that have flooded the market in recent years and become increasingly popular among younger consumers, particularly Gen Z. With a series of legal actions, the flagship brand of LVMH group is trying to stop the invasion of copied models crowding the global market \u2013 but what\u2019s remarkable is that the brand is no longer just targeting unknown knock-off labels but has started aiming at much bigger imitators. The most recent case, reported by Pambianco, involves Steve Madden, a US brand accused of copying its famous Multi Pochette Accessoires, the bag that combines multiple pouches and straps into a single accessory. Steve Madden is known for producing rather blatant dupes of products originally designed by brands like Celine, Saint Laurent, and Prada, but in this case, Louis Vuitton accused Steve Madden of directly copying its bag with the Burgent model. The lawsuit is not just about damages but also includes a request to ban the sale of the Burgent model across the entire European Union. As The Fashion Law explains, however, the legal issue has been complicated by the fact that Steve Madden is legally based in the Netherlands, while Louis Vuitton filed the case in France, where the French court does not have direct jurisdiction over the entire European market. As a result, the court decided to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), which will have to decide whether Louis Vuitton can seek an EU-wide sales ban through a French court. If the ruling goes in Louis Vuitton\u2019s favor, it could represent a crucial victory in the fight against dupes, with important legal consequences for other brands facing the same issue.\n\nWhile awaiting a verdict that could mark the first significant luxury victory against dupes, Louis Vuitton has scored another legal win \u2013 this time against another luxury brand, Van Cleef & Arpels, which had accused Louis Vuitton of copying and ended up defeated. On March 5, the French Court of Cassation sided with Louis Vuitton in its dispute with the Richemont Group brand over the use of a similar floral motif to Van Cleef & Arpels' iconic Alhambra design. Richemont had accused Louis Vuitton of unfairly exploiting the reputation of its famous design with the Color Blossom collection, which featured a four-petal motif similar to Van Cleef & Arpels' clover shape. However, the court rejected the charge of \u201cparasitic competition\u201d, which required proof that Louis Vuitton had deliberately exploited Van Cleef & Arpels' reputation for financial gain. The court found that the clover motif was a common element in the jewelry industry and that Louis Vuitton had used its own pre-existing design, similar but distinct from that of Van Cleef & Arpels. The ruling stated that although there were similarities between the two designs, there was no unlawful appropriation by Louis Vuitton. Rather than defending the brand from imitations, the ruling reaffirmed the strength of Louis Vuitton\u2019s branding and of its individual components (specifically the clover motif) against the claims of other historic brands. According to The Fashion Law, \u201cthe decision strengthens existing protections for trademarks in terms of product expansion (somewhat similar to the natural zone of expansion in the US), thus allowing companies to expand existing designs without facing legal restrictions.\u201d\n\nAnother important chapter in this legal battle was written last October, when Louis Vuitton secured a decisive victory against an attempt to register a trademark imitating its Toile Monogram in the European Union. As The Fashion Law explains, the Opposition Division of the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) rejected the registration request by an unaffiliated third party that sought to use a decorative motif similar to Louis Vuitton\u2019s famous monogram, featuring the floral pattern and letters. The new trademark was intended for use on apparel, footwear, and leather goods\u2014sectors where Louis Vuitton has a strong presence. The EUIPO\u2019s ruling emphasized the importance of protecting well-known trademarks from attempts at \u201cfree riding\u201d, that is, attempts to unfairly capitalize on the reputation of established brands. The decision highlighted the exclusive value of luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and how they must be protected from imitations that could damage their identity and distinctive strength in the global market.\n\nLove that fucking Massimo Dutti aka my mothers favorite brand to pick up from Target is now a well done dupe for The Row and Lemaire girls lmaooooo \u2014 NAACP Twigs (@turnandstomp) August 1, 2024\n\nLouis Vuitton\u2019s recent legal victories clearly signal the maison\u2019s intention to stop the wave of dupes that is threatening the exclusivity of its luxury products. The issue is more pressing than it seems: as Vogue Business reports, on TikTok alone, the hashtag #dupe has grown from 3.5 billion views in 2023 to 6.3 billion views this year \u2013 and more and more high street brands, led by COS and Zara, are seeing massive success with their low-cost imitations. Just consider that in the latest Lyst ranking, COS forcefully entered the list, landing in 17th place, propelled by the virality of a women\u2019s cashmere sweater that is a dupe of a cashmere sweater by The Row, costing six times more. But many of the accessible products and brands in the latest ranking were dupes: the crew-neck cardigan by &daughter is a dupe of the one by Prada, which costs 2.5 times more; while the loafers by Massimo Dutti closely resemble those by Saint Laurent. Not to mention the Minimal Sneakers, also by COS, which are a more affordable reconstruction of the successful model by Dries Van Noten, now a symbol\u2014alongside the New Balance x Miu Miu collab\u2014of the slim sneakers trend. However, if Louis Vuitton wins its case at the EU Court of Justice, things might be about to change: with such a strong precedent, the hunting season could truly open, and now that fashion is in crisis, more and more brands may start to go after their imitators to stop the sales bleed and protect an exclusivity that is increasingly at risk.",

But new designers face the tricky task of bringing the right dose of renewal, with investors giving them little time to establish themselves.Last week's announcement that Gucci had appointed Balenciaga designer Demna to head its design teams sent Kering shares down over 10 per cent, wiping around \u20b93 billion off the group's market value.In an era of \u201csuperstar\u201d creative directors , designers shape the identity of brands, even overshadowing a brand\u2019s heritage, said Jacques Roizen, of consultancy DLG. Many analysts had lobbied for bolder fashion at Gucci following a two-year push upmarket with more classic designs, but investors worry Demna, 43, who brought buzz to Kering's smaller label with high-end streetwear styles, might not be the right fit.Creative directors are redefining \u201cnot only the aesthetic direction but also the positioning and clientele of the houses,\u201d said Roizen.As China remains subdued, luxury brands are pinning their hopes on the US market this year, although signs of economic uncertainty are creeping in.Chanel, which is privately owned, is bringing in Matthieu Blazy, 40, after his successful run at Kering's Bottega Veneta. He faces the daunting task of ushering in a fresh design approach, overseen for decades by Karl Lagerfeld, and then by longtime collaborator Virginie Viard following Lagerfeld's death in 2019.The importance of the creative director can vary by brand, said Flavio Cereda, who manages GAM\u2019s Luxury Brands investment strategy. Since Viard's abrupt departure last year, Chanel has emphasised trademarks, sending models down a runway shaped in its interlocking-C logo or wearing clothes adorned with signature black bows - at Lagerfeld\u2019s preferred venue, Paris\u2019 Grand Palais.LVMH has yet to officially announce new creative leadership at Dior after menswear designer Kim Jones left in January, but is likely to soon hire a new designer, expected to be Jonathan Anderson. His departure from Loewe was announced on Monday, but LVMH declined to comment on Anderson's future role. There are also new faces at a host of smaller brands, including LVMH's Celine and Givenchy, and Donatella Versace, 69, is stepping aside at Versace after nearly three decades, replaced by Miu Miu's Dario Vitale.\u201cClients don't know where to go anymore with all these musical chairs,\u201d said Yannis Ouzene, a sales assistant for a major European brand.",

PHOTO: LOUIS VUITTON\n\n\u2018You need to be a little crazy to succeed,\u2019 says Louis Vuitton head honcho Pietro Beccari\n\nMELBOURNE \u2013 One pm, March 16, 2025. It is race day at the Australian Grand Prix 2025, and the excitement at Melbourne\u2019s iconic Albert Park Circuit is electric despite the rain and gusty winds. Fans, decked out in colourful raincoats and hooded ponchos, eagerly await the start, the anticipation palpable in every corner.\n\nStepping into Louis Vuitton\u2019s suite at the exclusive Formula One Paddock Club, Mr Pietro Beccari surveys the buzzing atmosphere with a satisfied smile. The chairman and chief executive of the French luxury house settles comfortably onto a plush sofa adorned with Louis Vuitton cushions, each retailing for more than $700.\n\nHe looks approvingly at the striking Louis Vuitton 2025 Grand Prix Trophy Trunk, displayed strategically next to the suite\u2019s entrance. Meticulously crafted in the brand\u2019s historic atelier in Asnieres in France, the trunk showcases the iconic LV monogram in brown and gold, accented by vivid green-and-gold checkerboard patterns that pay tribute to Australia.\n\nIt houses the winner\u2019s steering wheel, claimed later in the evening by McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris.\n\nThe room hums with excitement, champagne glasses clinking as bartenders craft endless cocktails and pour generous glasses of Moet & Chandon bubbly. After all, there is plenty of reason to celebrate.\n\nMcLaren driver Lando Norris with the Louis Vuitton 2025 Grand Prix Trophy Trunk. PHOTO: LOUIS VUITTON\n\nLast October, Louis Vuitton\u2019s parent company LVMH \u2013 which boasts a portfolio of 75 luxury lifestyle brands including Tiffany, Dior, Tag Heuer and Moet & Chandon \u2013 signed a landmark 10-year global partnership with F1 .\n\nLouis Vuitton now holds the prestigious title sponsorship for the season opener in Melbourne \u2013 the Formula 1 Louis Vuitton Australian Grand Prix 2025 \u2013 with prominent brand signage visible everywhere around the tracks.\n\nExuding an energy both infectious and commanding, Mr Beccari, 56, took over as Louis Vuitton\u2019s global CEO two years ago, following transformative leadership roles at Fendi and Dior.\n\nSince then, he has passionately driven the world\u2019s most valuable luxury brand, currently valued at a whopping US$129.9 billion (S$172.9 billion) by Kantar BrandZ, into exciting new territory. Kantar is a brand valuation and equity platform.\n\nMoving beyond fashion\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t just want to buy a bag any more. They want to be part of a cultural movement,\u201d he tells The Straits Times, marking his first Asian media interview since stepping into his role.\n\nHis innovative approach has already seen Louis Vuitton venture beyond fashion, launching into, among other things, restaurants, chocolates, hotels, vinyl records and, soon, beauty products.\n\nThe F1 partnership perfectly captures his vision, blending sport and luxury.\n\n\u201cSport is culture,\u201d emphasises Mr Beccari, who is also a member of the LVMH executive committee . \u201cWe\u2019re here with F1 for the next decade because it embodies speed, passion and innovation \u2013 all values which resonate with Louis Vuitton.\u201d\n\nThis is not simply about branding, he says. It is about blending luxury into the essence of sport and crafting an irresistible story that captures hearts and imaginations around the world.\n\nBorn in the Italian city of Parma, Mr Beccari\u2019s path to becoming a titan of the luxury industry was anything but ordinary. Growing up, he dreamt of football glory, idolising the legendary Argentine player Diego Maradona, and even played professionally for an Italian second-division team until he was 18.\n\nThough he never made it to the national squad, those years on the pitch taught him invaluable lessons in discipline and teamwork.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no victory without hard work and sacrifice,\u201d he insists. \u201cSuccess is 90 per cent effort and just 10 per cent talent. You can\u2019t win alone, but as a team, anything is possible.\u201d\n\nHis leadership mirrors this ethos: dynamic, demanding but authentic. \u201cI expect a lot from myself, so, naturally, I push my team too,\u201d he says.\n\nIn October 2024, LVMH, Louis Vuitton\u2019s parent company, signed a landmark 10-year global partnership with Formula 1. PHOTO: LOUIS VUITTON\n\nAfter graduating with a business degree from the University of Parma in 1992, he built his early career outside luxury, first at British consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser in Milan, then at Italian food and dairy distributor Parmalat in New York, followed by a decade in the shampoo and haircare sector at German multinational Henkel, where he rose to corporate vice-president.\n\nAt that point, luxury was completely foreign to him. Mr Beccari, then based in Dusseldorf, chuckles at the memory of unknowingly buying his wife a fake Louis Vuitton handbag from a flea market in the German town of Buchel.\n\n\u201cI had no clue what Louis Vuitton or luxury was,\u201d he says with a laugh.\n\nHis world changed when the late Yves Carcelle \u2013 well-known former chairman and chief executive of Louis Vuitton \u2013 hired him in 2006 to become the brand\u2019s executive vice-president of marketing and communications.\n\n\u201cYves invited my wife and me to his house and we were mesmerised by the luxury we saw,\u201d he says. \u201cWe discovered the world. We changed. The job changes your taste and the way you live. It penetrates your senses, reopens your pores and your mind, and gets your antenna up. I\u2019ve now spent 20 years in the luxury business and could not go back to anything else.\u201d\n\nAt Louis Vuitton, the marketing whiz quickly made a name for himself, nabbing industry acclaim, notably with iconic campaigns such as Core Values (2011) featuring American actress Angelina Jolie barefoot in Cambodia, snapped by renowned American photographer Annie Leibovitz.\n\nCandidly, he reveals that he had hoped to succeed Mr Carcelle.\n\n\u201cHe was a fantastic guy who turned Louis Vuitton into what it is today and I learnt so much from him. I was a bit p***ed off that I was sent to Fendi,\u201d says Mr Beccari, who was made chairman and chief executive of the Italian fashion house in 2012.\n\nDescribing himself as someone who never looks back because \u201cthe past is gone\u201d, he threw himself into reinventing Fendi, giving the brand a fresh, youthful appeal and pioneering daring concepts.\n\nOne headline-making move was the 2016 transformation of the historic 17th-century Palazzo Fendi in Rome, creating not just a flagship store, but also the brand\u2019s first boutique hotel, Fendi Private Suites; an exclusive apartment, Palazzo Prive; and a restaurant, Zuma.\n\nDetractors sniggered, but success soon had competitors scrambling to imitate his vision.\n\nLouis Vuitton and Takashi Murakami collaborated to launch a hugely successful collection with the Japanese artist\u2019s quirky and colourful designs on leather goods, accessories, travel luggage and shoes. PHOTO: LOUIS VUITTON\n\nNow at Louis Vuitton, Mr Beccari is gearing up to amaze again, overseeing the ambitious development of the 6,000 sq m Hotel Louis Vuitton in Paris\u2019 Champs-Elysees. The historic 1896 building, once HSBC\u2019s headquarters, is undergoing a secretive transformation hidden behind a giant facade resembling a classic Louis Vuitton trunk.\n\nIt is slated to open in 2027, but he keeps details tantalisingly vague: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be something the world will not be expecting.\u201d\n\nMr Beccari is a firm believer in constantly levelling up, a philosophy he likens to playing a video game where each stage brings new challenges and rewards.\n\nDreaming huge\n\nAsked if he has always been gutsy and unconventional, he smiles and shrugs: \u201cYou have to take risks if you want to advance \u2013 in life and in business. I always tell my people they should not just think big, they should think huge.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cI want a company of people who think out of the box, are not slaves to the system or just follow the rules of what has been done before.\u201d\n\nHis take on risks is refreshingly blunt: \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen? Losing my job? So what?\u201d\n\nIn many ways, he draws inspiration from the boldness of his boss Bernard Arnault, founder of LVMH and one of the world\u2019s richest and most visionary entrepreneurs.\n\nMr Arnault, he says, was \u201ccrazy enough\u201d to dream about creating the world\u2019s biggest luxury empire by acquiring some of the most iconic brands on the planet. And he did.\n\n\u201cYou need to be a little bit crazy to succeed,\u201d says Mr Beccari, who took that same daring approach when he was handed the reins at another LVMH jewel, Dior, in 2018.\n\nHe transformed the brand, not only increasing revenue growth but also its global presence.\n\nLife came full circle when Mr Arnault personally tapped him to return and lead Louis Vuitton.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d actually forgotten about Vuitton,\u201d Mr Beccari jokes. But when the call came, there was no hesitation.\n\nMusician Pharrell Williams, seen here with his wife Helen Lasichanh, was tapped to become Louis Vuitton men\u2019s creative director. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nOne of his first \u2013 and boldest \u2013 moves in his new role was bringing in Pharrell Williams, the American musician, producer and fashion icon, as men\u2019s creative director. Eyebrows raised at the announcement, but the decision proved visionary.\n\n\u201cPharrell radiates positive energy and great values \u2013 he\u2019s a good person,\u201d Mr Beccari says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I look for in a collaborator.\u201d\n\nHis instinct for talent goes beyond celebrities. He seeks authenticity, creativity and individuals who are not \u201ccorrupted by ambition\u201d.\n\nRetaining great talent, he believes, is all about building an environment where people feel inspired and valued. \u201cPeople need to know they\u2019re part of something truly meaningful,\u201d he adds.\n\nSince taking over, he has wasted no time in making the world\u2019s biggest brand even more dynamic.\n\nIn addition to hugely successful fashion collaborations, such as the one with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, the last two years have seen Louis Vuitton venturing into unconventional areas like chocolates and dining.\n\nLV The Place Bangkok houses Gaggan at Louis Vuitton fine-dining restaurant, an exhibition space, a boutique and Le Cafe Louis Vuitton patisserie. PHOTO: LOUIS VUITTON\n\nFor example, February 2024 saw the launch of Le Chocolat Maxime Frederic at Marina Bay Sands, the first Louis Vuitton chocolate atelier outside France.\n\nThat same month, LV The Place Bangkok opened its doors, an innovative \u201c360 experiential concept\u201d combining the upscale Gaggan at Louis Vuitton\u2019s fine-dining restaurant, an exhibition space, a boutique and Le Cafe Louis Vuitton patisserie.\n\nNext up? Beauty. From August, the luxury house will unveil its beauty line La Beaute Louis Vuitton, available exclusively in Louis Vuitton boutiques. The creative force overseeing the venture is Dame Pat McGrath from England, who has been hailed as \u201cthe most influential make-up artist in the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cBeauty is profoundly anchored in the culture of Louis Vuitton, because at the beginning of the last century, we were producing beautiful vanity cases for the travelling actresses and sopranos of the world,\u201d Mr Beccari says.\n\nThe founder\u2019s grandson, Gaston Louis Vuitton, further enriched this legacy by creating the brand\u2019s first fragrance in 1927. Although the company ceased perfume production in 1946, it reignited this tradition in 2016 with a fresh and luxurious fragrance line.\n\n\u201cOur fragrances have been an immense success, giving us double-digit growth for many years. So, it\u2019s now time for our next step,\u201d Mr Beccari says.\n\nDame Pat McGrath is the new creative director of cosmetics for Louis Vuitton. PHOTO: LOUIS VUITTON\n\nThe new Louis Vuitton beauty line, however, comes at a premium. \u201cYes, our lipstick will cost three times the price of the most expensive lipstick on the market,\u201d he says with a grin. \u201cBut trust me, it\u2019s five times better.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging the current economic downturn has made things challenging for the luxury market, he is optimistic.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s a tough moment and, frankly, it\u2019s lasting longer than I expected,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut luxury will bounce back. I don\u2019t know exactly when, but when it does, the world will be in a better place.\u201d\n\nAfter all, he believes luxury is fundamentally emotional. It is about joy, excitement and pleasure.\n\n\u201cOur goal isn\u2019t to change the world,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we can definitely make people\u2019s lives more pleasant and enjoyable. That\u2019s a need that never goes away. As Mr Arnault once jokingly told (Apple founder) Steve Jobs: \u2018Your phone might not be around in a few years, but my Dom Perignon will still be here.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor Mr Beccari, luxury is timeless yet constantly evolving.\n\n\u201cWe must honour our heritage but never stop innovating,\u201d he insists. \u201cQuiet luxury, fun luxury \u2013 it\u2019s cyclical. Louis Vuitton has always been joyful, dynamic and full of life. We\u2019re never going quiet.\u201d\n\nLe Chocolat Maxime Frederic at Marina Bay Sands is the first Louis Vuitton chocolate atelier outside France. PHOTO: LOUIS VUITTON\n\nMarried for 40 years to his childhood sweetheart, he believes this vibrant philosophy resonates particularly well with younger consumers \u2013 a demographic notoriously difficult to impress.\n\nThe corporate maverick says his three daughters, aged 20, 26 and 28, keep him sharply attuned to younger tastes, regularly informing him in no uncertain terms what is \u201cs**t\u201d and what is \u201cgood\u201d.\n\n\u201cI never take for granted that they\u2019re 100 per cent right. But they definitely make me think.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung people have a radar for authenticity,\u201d he adds thoughtfully. \u201cIn today\u2019s age of social media and transparency, you just can\u2019t fake who you are.\u201d\n\nBeneath Mr Beccari\u2019s boundless confidence lies unmistakable vulnerability.\n\n\u201cAm I afraid of failure? Absolutely,\u201d he says candidly. \u201cFailure tastes terrible. But I never dwell on setbacks \u2013 I erase them instantly. Like Rafael Nadal in tennis, I focus only on the next ball because that is the most important.\u201d\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.",

            "content": "After Zenith\u2019s latest showing at LVMH Watch Week 2025, a new category might need to be added to the Master of Chronographs title \u2014 Master of Colours. From the most recent DEFY Extreme Jungle to the DEFY 21 Chroma II and DEFY Midnight Sunset, Zenith has quietly added colours to its repertoire. Colours would have been one of the last things people would associate the Le Locle manufacture with, but it has been steadily producing eye-catching pieces apart from the atypical range of blue, white and black. While this might be a farfetched theory, to say the least, perhaps Argentine-Spanish artist Felipe Pantone\u2019s collaborations with Zenith over the past few years have blossomed and elicited a positive effect on Zenith\u2019s design team.\n\nZenith\u2019s LVMH Watch Week 2025 novelty, the Chronomaster Sport Rainbow, continues in this foray with a resplendent take on watchmaking. If you are an avid follower, you would know by now what the rainbow connotation in watch names means \u2014 a gradated multicoloured gem-set bezel. This example is exactly it, utilising Zenith\u2019s popular Chronomaster Sport as canvas. The case and bracelet are crafted in 18k white gold, while the bezel features 50 baguette cut gems consisting of 40 sapphires (~3.9cts) and 10 diamonds (~1ct). A further 12 baguette sapphires are arranged in the hour indices against the inky black dial and Zenith\u2019s signature overlapping tricolour counters.\n\nWithin the watch is where Zenith\u2019s true mastery shines \u2014 high-frequency chronographs. The El Primero 3600 Automatic calibre operates at a frequency of 36,000 vph (higher than industry standards of 28,800 vph) to ensure greater accuracy and precision. Its chronograph benefits from the higher frequency too, allowing it to record up to 1/10th of a second.\n\nOnce you are done with this story, click here to catch up with our March 2025 issue.",

            "content": "Carlotta and Nicol\u00f2 Oddi have announced that they have reacquired the ownership stake that New Guards Group held in Alanui, the brand the two siblings founded in 2015 in Milan. This marks a return to independence for the brand, which will now manage all corporate functions autonomously, including operations and distribution. Carlotta Oddi will remain in her role as Creative Director, while Nicol\u00f2 Oddi will continue as CEO, ensuring continuity in the business strategy. The buyback represents an opportunity for the founders to further strengthen the brand's identity and lead its creative direction. Starting from the SS26 season, Alanui will directly distribute its collections, particularly in the US and Europe, and will have its own showroom in Milan. The immediate goal will be to consolidate the wholesale channel in these areas before expanding further into Asia, where the brand has already explored the market through pop-up stores in Japan. The reacquisition of Alanui takes place within the broader context of the progressive dismantling of New Guards Group, a division of Farfetch, which has lost the Off-White license and sold Palm Angels to Bluestar Alliance amid a corporate restructuring process to cope with a (to put it mildly) complex financial situation.\n\nHowever, the news fits into an even broader context than the sinking of Farfetch and the New Guards Group. In recent months, two other designers have also decided to reacquire full control of their operations: Stella McCartney and Giuseppe Zanotti both bought back the minority stakes that the Arnault family, through LVMH or L Catterton, had acquired in their respective brands over the years. What\u2019s striking is the frequency of such cases, which with Alanui become three in six months, and which overall seem at first glance to be counterintuitive moves: regaining independence in a tough market like fashion in 2025 doesn't seem advisable \u2013 nonetheless, we can assume that in both McCartney and Zanotti\u2019s cases, the business had become strong enough to allow a return to independence. Cutting out external investors also means regaining autonomy in an industry context where stock market listings and investor presence imply a loss of full control over the company and therefore less strategic flexibility \u2013 and of course, greater distribution of profits. But Zanotti and McCartney run multimillion-dollar businesses. Alanui\u2019s case seems different, in many ways more similar to when the founders of Proenza Schouler bought back the brand from their investors in 2018. Overall, there seems to be a sense that both individual designers and big groups are rethinking the conglomerate model: the former want full autonomy without having to share the metaphorical pie, the latter have realized that overly large structures tend to collapse under their own weight.\n\nWith most luxury industry groups currently in troubled \u2013 or at least not optimal \u2013 waters, it\u2019s only natural that the category of designer-entrepreneurs would want to distance themselves from a model that\u2019s beginning to show signs of fatigue \u2013 especially now, in times of crisis, as several groups are considering divesting, selling or offloading brands that have become burdensome, converting them into valuable liquidity. This is the case, for example, of Capri Holdings: the WSJ recently reported how CEO John Idol first tried to steer Versace toward the quiet luxury territory by repositioning the brand and clashing with Donatella, only to ultimately decide to sell it when things didn\u2019t improve. The same may soon happen to Jimmy Choo, which, according to a recent article in the Telegraph, could soon return to the hands of Tamara Mellon, the powerhouse executive who acquired it in 1996, turned it into a global phenomenon, and sold it in 2011. Last year, Tomorrow Group sold A-Cold-Wall just nine months after acquiring it from its founder, while recently LVMH both acquired minority stakes in brands such as Kapital and Our Legacy and sold off secondary brands in its lineup such as Off-White, Stella McCartney, and Thomas Pink \u2013 but according to rumors, it also considered letting go of Marc Jacobs. Kering sold off its outlet chain The Mall last January, Aeffe took advantage of Lorenzo Serafini\u2019s entry into Alberta Ferretti to shut down the Philosophy line. Perhaps, following the philosophy of cutting \u201cnon-core\u201d businesses, facing the storm by throwing ballast overboard, fashion is finding a path toward degrowth, breaking away from the \u201coligopoly\u201d situation the industry had begun to fall into.",

This year, the city reclaimed its crown as the debut race of the season, with a palpable excitement all across the Victorian capital to match.\n\nOn-track there was plenty of popcorn action for attendees to sink their teeth into, including a roster of all-star rookies making their respective Formula 1 debuts. A young and hungry Oscar Piastri, with a very capable car, was eager to impress; and a pillar of the sport \u2013 Sir Lewis Hamilton \u2013 began the next chapter of a glittering career, this time with Scuderia Ferrari. Add in a day of dramatic, wet track conditions and we couldn\u2019t have asked for much more.\n\nOff-track, global luxury titan LVMH took centre stage for its first ever race-wide sponsorship: leveraging many of its 70+ brands in the fashion and beverage space at no small expense.\n\nWith that, here\u2019s a quick look in the rearview at the week that was \u2013 at the 2025 Formula 1 Louis Vuitton Australian Grand Prix.\n\nWednesday \u2013 Belvedere 10 at Maison B\u00e2tard\n\nTo kickstart LVMH\u2019s week-long run of F1 activations, Belvedere hosted a soir\u00e9e at Lucas Group\u2019s buzzy new multi-venue destination, Maison B\u00e2tard.\n\nThis year, Belvedere becomes the first ever \u2018Official Vodka\u2019 of Formula 1: providing the perfect occasion to hero its Belvedere 10 Diamond Rye bottling.\n\nA star-studded guestlist was also in attendance: including such familiar faces as Josh Heuston, Mel Jarnson, Jerome Farah, Sener Besim, and Yasmin Suteja. Naturally, Belvedere-built Martinis were the signature (and exclusive) tipple of the evening, enjoyed alongside a four-course tasting menu of classic French cuisine.\n\nAfter dinner, guests descended to Le Club for an exclusive after-party: complete with \u2018drops\u2019 of Blevedere 10 and cheeky caviar bumps, sound tracked by local Melbourne selector Sasha Fern.\n\nPhotography courtesy of Peter van Alphen\n\nPictured: Josh Heuston and Mel Jarnson\n\nThursday \u2013 An Evening of Excellence with Mo\u00ebt & Chandon\n\nNo Toorak mansion was left undisturbed by the Arnault clan\u2019s house of brands for the 2025 Australian Grand Prix, with Mo\u00ebt & Chandon being another significant presence well beyond the confines of Albert Park.\n\nGuests who joined the celebration included Dan Carter, Formula 1 drivers David Coulthard and Jacques Villeneuve, as well as Abbey Lee, Jessica Gomes and Inka Williams. Sydney-side hospitality heavy Joel Bickford prepared a five-course meal (heavy on his preferred proteins of veal and toothfish) served on the lawn of a stately private residence \u2013 by candlelight to jazzy tunes courtesy of award-winning pianist Nathan Liow.\n\nOn the carte guests got to imbibe a trio of notable vintage bubbles: both the 2013 and 2016 editions of the signature Grand Vintage, plus a standout Grand Vintage Ros\u00e9 2016.\n\nPhotography courtesy of Virgile Guinard\n\nPictured (left to right): Damon Hill, Jacques Villeneuve, Dan Carter, Sibylle Scherer, David Coulthard.\n\nPictured: Inka Williams\n\nFriday \u2013 TAG Heuer Returns To Formula 1\n\nThe battle of the brands continued on Friday following a big day of practice sessions on track, with precision watchmaker TAG Heuer making an explosive return to the world of Formula 1 as \u2018Official Timekeeper\u2019 (the brand\u2019s first historic foray into F1 was as timing partner of Scuderia Ferrari in the 1970s).\n\nNaturally, an evening of exceptional eating and drinking brought together an equally impressive lineup of senior execs \u2013 including the man himself, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, CEO of LVMH Watches; as well as Stefano Domenicali, CEO of Formula 1 and Antoine Pin, CEO of TAG Heuer.\n\nBut naturally, all eyes were on globally acclaimed actress Alexandra Daddario, who dominated the media wall and media attention \u2013 with a diamond-set Carrera \u2018Glassbox\u2019 chronograph on the wrist.

It also aims to unite INSEAD graduates currently working within the LVMH group and its Maisons, thereby fostering collaboration and intergenerational exchanges.\n\n\n\nThe partnership between LVMH and INSEAD, under the direction of Jean-Jacques Guiony, focuses on three main areas: education, research, and talent development. Officially launched in November 2024, the partnership was marked by an exceptional and inaugural masterclass by Mr. Guiony.\n\n\n\nThe establishment of this exclusive Alumni network marks a new era of partnership between LVMH and INSEAD, aiming to strengthen the ties between these two prestigious institutions.\n\n\n\nJean-Jacques Guiony delivered the opening speech, stating: \"By strengthening the collaboration between our two institutions, this partnership offers INSEAD the opportunity to explore real-world business cases and co-develop research topics with us, while enabling LVMH top management and our LVMH-INSEAD alumni to share their vision of luxury with a highly discerning and demanding audience of MBA students.\"\n\n\n\nFrancesco Veloso emphasized: \"Today marks a welcome evolution in our relationship, combining INSEAD\u2019s academic expertise with LVMH\u2019s industry-leading experience. This collaboration highlights LVMH\u2019s commitment to developing its people and the benefits INSEAD brings through rigorous research and impactful teaching. We look forward to our students gaining from the industry insights of our LVMH-INSEAD alumni network.\"\n\n\n\nAntoine Arnault stated: \"I am thrilled to contribute to the further strengthening of our ties with INSEAD through this new Alumni network. At LVMH, talent development and knowledge sharing are fundamental values.

Then, another episode of warmth and sustained southeasterly winds signaled the advent of a magnificent harvest.\n\n\n\nThe legend of Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Yquem 2022 was written in a fever that segued into passion, an anguish transformed into triumph. This vintage bears the promise of a wine with exceptional aging potential, introducing an exciting new interpretation of \"Yquem time\".\n\n",

Since joining Loewe in 2013, Anderson has transformed the Spanish leather goods company into a major cultural name and a top brand at LVMH, which also owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, and Fendi.\n\nThe move comes after a decade in which Anderson redefined Loewe, turning it into a $2 billion brand that has become known for breaking norms around gender and form in design, as well as playing with tradition in a way his peers were not.\n\n\u201cWhat he has contributed to Loewe goes beyond creativity,\u201d Sidney Toledano, the chief executive of the LVMH Fashion Group said of Anderson\u2019s influence in the news release.\n\nThe shift comes as Anderson\u2019s time at Loewe seemed to reach a peak. Last year, Loewe held a blockbuster exhibition at Shanghai Exhibition Centre that might as well have been a survey of Anderson\u2019s time at the brand. In the fall, T: The New York Times Style Magazine named Anderson one of its \u201cGreats\u201d for the year. (Rumors abound that Anderson will head Dior next.)\n\nAnderson too developed a reputation, and found commercial success, by intertwining the worlds of fashion and art to an unprecedented degree. Each Loewe season seemed to be accompanied by a new collaboration with a contemporary artist or a nod to a historical one. And Anderson founded the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize in 2016, an international award for contemporary craft artists with a \u20ac50,000 award.\n\nBelow, a list of Loewe\u2019s top artist collaborations under Anderson:",

Under his leadership, the Spanish brand experienced significant financial success, culminating in a 62.5 per cent surge in net profit to approximately US $ 223.7 million in 2023 , while revenue approached approximately US $ 875.7 million. Loewe\u2019s sales surpassed approximately US $ 1.08 billion in 2024. His creative vision, including the iconic Puzzle bag, celebrating its 10th anniversary, established Loewe as a leading voice in modern luxury, rooted in exceptional craftsmanship.\n\nLVMH, the parent company of both Loewe and Dior, has expressed immense gratitude for Anderson\u2019s contributions. Statements from Loewe CEO Pascale Lepoivre and LVMH\u2019s Sidney Toledano highlight Anderson\u2019s \u201cunmatched creativity,\u201d \u201cpassion,\u201d and his ability to build a \u201crich and eclectic world.\u201d Anderson, himself, reflected on his \u201cwildly ambitious ideas\u201d and the supportive team that made them a reality, expressing pride in Loewe\u2019s future.\n\nThe industry is now abuzz with speculation about Anderson\u2019s next move. Rumors suggest a potential shift to Dior, following the pattern of luxury giants retaining top talent within their portfolios, much like Demna\u2019s recent move from Kering\u2019s Balenciaga to Gucci. While there\u2019s no official vacancy in Dior\u2019s womenswear, the menswear position is available after Kim Jones\u2019 departure. Neither Anderson nor LVMH have confirmed these rumors.\n\nAnderson\u2019s departure marks the end of a pivotal chapter for Loewe, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and significant financial growth.

            "content": "Is silence golden? Executives at luxury fashion houses certainly seem to think so. While the top-tier maisons thrive on narrative control, the recent delays in designer appointment announcements reveal an industry grappling with uncertainty and brand identity recalibration. But for the industry at large\u2014and consumers\u2014the prolonged silence has only fueled speculation, turning rumour into near-certainty.\n\nTake Dior. Speculation is mounting over Maria Grazia Chiuri\u2019s potential exit after her May show, coinciding with Jonathan Anderson\u2019s confirmed departure from Loewe. The question is no longer whether Dior\u2019s leadership will change but rather when it will be confirmed. The industry first picked up on this shift months ago, and again in January when Kim Jones resigned from his role at Dior, clearing a path for Anderson\u2019s anticipated ascent. Yet, no official word has emerged from LVMH, leaving observers to read between the lines.\n\nMultiple factors are at play. The post-pandemic luxury landscape has reshaped the financial and strategic priorities of conglomerates, forcing them to take a more measured approach to succession planning. High-end brands with marquee-name artistic directors are wary of the revolving-door effect\u2014a stark contrast to the era of rapid-fire creative turnovers. Gucci\u2019s struggle to regain footing under Sabato De Sarno exemplifies the risks of misaligned appointments. Meanwhile, Demna\u2019s new appointment at Gucci may have rattled industry insiders, but it also underscored Kering\u2019s limited options in securing a suitable replacement.\n\nAvoiding the revolving door effect\n\nDior, a house that masterfully balances commercial dominance with couture prestige, cannot afford a misstep. A creative overhaul must align with internal strategy, investor confidence, and consumer sentiment. But as luxury brands double down on secrecy, they risk underestimating the value of transparency. In an age of relentless digital scrutiny, information vacuums invite speculation, which\u2014if not properly managed\u2014can chip away at a brand\u2019s aura of control.\n\nThe prolonged silence around these appointments reflects the intensity of contractual negotiations and brand recalibrations behind the scenes. If Anderson does, in fact, take the reins at Dior across both men\u2019s and women\u2019s lines, it would mark a bold creative shift\u2014one that demands a meticulously transition. Under Bernard Arnault\u2019s leadership, LVMH has perfected the art of the quiet handover. Chanel and Bottega Veneta have also embraced this playbook, demonstrating the power of precisely timed revelations.\n\nLuxury brands have become hyper-aware of how the media cycle affects their equity. The era of impulsive, splashy reveals is long gone. Today, strategic leaks and carefully controlled confirmations build anticipation, ensuring that brands maintain control over their own narratives. With Dior, the stakes are particularly high\u2014its creative direction shapes not only its own trajectory but also the broader industry landscape.\n\nFor now, the silence continues. But in fashion, as in business, the absence of an announcement is often the loudest statement of all.",

            "content": "New World Development Co., the Hong Kong real estate company controlled by the billionaire Cheng family, is in talks with luxury giant Louis Vuitton to open a mega store in one of the developer\u2019s signature malls, according to people familiar with the matter.The new store would occupy about 40,000 square feet at the K11 Musea mall, making it one of Louis Vuitton\u2019s largest in Asia, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. The store could feature a museum, a cafe and a lounge for the brand\u2019s VIP customers, they said. Details over rent remain unclear.Discussions are at an advanced stage, but details could still change and the deal could still fall apart, the people said.New World didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for LVMH declined to comment.New World\u2019s shares rose as much as 10% Tuesday. LVMH stock rose as much as 1% in early trading, but is still down about 28.5% in the past 12 months.If an agreement is reached, the expansion of fashion conglomerate LVMH\u2019s largest brand would inject some confidence into Hong Kong\u2019s retail industry and help its ailing commercial property sector. It would also be a boost for New World, which has been struggling with debt woes and uncertainty over its leadership. The group\u2019s retail rents and valuation for its investment properties could rise with the new store strengthening its retail presence and drawing stronger foot traffic, said Bloomberg Intelligence analysts including Patrick Wong and Daniel Fan in notes Tuesday.Located near the city\u2019s famous Victoria Harbor, K11 Musea is a popular destination for tourists and its exclusive private members clubs have attracted a group of wealthy clientele through the Cheng family\u2019s networks. LVMH\u2019s proposed ultra-exclusive mega store underscores the luxury brands\u2019 efforts to wring more growth from the ultra-rich who are less affected by an economic slowdown in China, which has sapped demand among middle-class shoppers.The French luxury conglomerate said in January that sales at its key fashion and leather goods unit, which include the Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior brands, had fallen 1% in the fourth quarter amid choppy demand. Sales in the region that includes China dropped 10%, the only geographic area that did not show growth.LVMH\u2019s results raised concerns that the industry\u2019s recovery from last year\u2019s slump may be slow and uneven, with Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault warning of a \u201cgradual recovery\u201d in China.While Hong Kong has been suffering from declining retail sales and a slow recovery in tourism, the city still has the highest concentration of millionaires in the Greater China region. It was ranked the world\u2019s ninth wealthiest city, according to a report published last year by investment migration company Henley & Partners in partnership with intelligence firm New World Wealth.K11 Musea is accelerating its pivot to luxury shopping with Prada SpA opening a new store and other high-end labels, including LVMH\u2019s Loewe and Kering SA\u2019s Saint Laurent and Balenciaga upgrading their facilities. Louis Vuitton\u2019s debut fashion show in Hong Kong in 2023 was hosted in front of the center.Facing mounting pressure over its debt burden, New World has proposed pledging some of its most-prized properties valued at a total $19.1 billion, in order to refinance its loans, Bloomberg News reported earlier this year. K11 Musea, located on a site where the Cheng family has owned properties since the 1970s, is seen as a heritage asset for the clan. The family is the center of an ongoing succession saga with patriarch Henry Cheng saying he is still looking for someone to take charge of the family business.",

In 2022, the group voted to amend the company\u2019s bylaws to allow the CEO\u2019s age limit to rise from 75 to 80, the publication says.\n\nArnault\u2019s succession plan has long been up for debate, as the public waits to see which of his offspring will ascend to the top of the LVMH food chain upon the CEO\u2019s retirement.

The 76-year-old billionaire is once again asking shareholders to extend his impending retirement. A proposal to amend LVMH\u2019s bylaws and raise the age limit of its CEO and chairman positions from 80 to 85 will be heard during the conglomerate\u2019s annual meeting on April 17, according to company documents. This isn\u2019t the first time Arnault, who has led LVMH for some 35 years, has attempted to prolong his time in power\u2014back in 2022, he successfully raised the company\u2019s CEO retirement age from 75 to 80.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

Last year, the group raked in nearly 85 billion euros ($92.8 billion) in revenue. Arnault, currently the world\u2019s fifth richest person with an estimated net worth of $170.9 billion, has remained tight-lipped over which of his five children will take the reins once he finally steps down.\n\nArnault\u2019s four sons and one daughter all currently hold roles within their father\u2019s luxury empire. His eldest child, Antoine, serves as head of communication and image at LVMH, while Delphine is CEO and chairman of Christian Dior Couture. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, meanwhile, was recently named CEO of the cashmere brand Loro Piana. Alexandre and Jean work as head of Mo\u00ebt Hennessy and director of watches at Louis Vuitton, respectively.\n\nWarren Buffett and Bill Gates also support late retirement\n\nThe LVMH leader has previously found support in his bucking of traditional retirement ages from the likes of Warren Buffett, who is turning 95 this year. After initially raising his retirement age to 80 three years ago, the French billionaire reportedly received a letter from Buffett saying the new limit was still too low.\n\nBuffett, who has run Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) for 60 years, has long praised the seniority of his older executives. During Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting in 2024, he quipped that \u201canybody who wants to retire at 65 would be disqualified from being CEO of Berkshire.\u201d The investor\u2019s thoughts on retirement are admired by fellow billionaire Bill Gates, who is currently 69 years old and last year stated that he\u2019d like to follow Buffett\u2019s lead and continue working for two to three more decades.\n\nSuch approaches contrast the standard retirement age of 65 in the U.S.\u2014an age that Larry Fink, chairman of BlackRock, thinks should be increased. In a 2024 investor letter that pointed to the increased strain of America\u2019s Social Security Administration amid a rise in retired citizens, Fink noted that it\u2019s a \u201cbit crazy\u201d that the U.S. still abides by a retirement age that originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSimilar financial issues are underway in France, which recently saw French President Emmanuel Macron raise the country\u2019s retirement age from 62 to 64 to allow pension systems to keep up with its retirees. French citizens, however, don\u2019t appear to share Arnault\u2019s sentiments around extending retirement. They quickly took aim at billionaires like the LVMH head, arguing they should shoulder some of the responsibility for financing pensions. The protests culminated in more than 100 French workers storming LVMH\u2019s Paris headquarters in April 2023.",

We present the most exciting novelties.\n\nBy Marianne Eschbach\n\nIt all began in 2020. The world's largest and most important watch fair at the time, Baselworld, had just been laid to rest, and the pandemic lockdown had not yet been imposed when four LVMH brands\u2014Bulgari, Hublot, Tag Heuer, and Zenith\u2014presented their novelties in Dubai, ahead of all other watch brands.\n\nThe \u00abLVMH Watch Week\u00bb was born and was, according to its organizers, an instant success\u2014so much so that two subsequent digital editions during the pandemic years could not diminish its impact. Later editions took place in Singapore and Miami, and for 2025, Los Angeles was on the agenda.\n\nSmall but refined\n\nHowever, the devastating wildfires in the first weeks of the year made it impossible to hold the event in the Californian metropolis as planned, leading to a last-minute split; the timepiece preview for the American market took place in New York, while European audiences received the information ten days later in Paris. A statement from the organizers explained the choice of these two locations: \u00abto connect the two continents that are of central importance to the LVMH Group.\u00bb\n\nThe French luxury conglomerate's watch portfolio now also includes small, refined niche brands like Daniel Roth and G\u00e9rald Genta (1931\u20132011). The latter was one of the most famous watch designers of the 1970s, responsible for icons such as Audemars Piguet\u2019s \u00abRoyal Oak,\u00bb Patek Philippe\u2019s \u00abNautilus,\u00bb Cartier\u2019s \u00abPasha,\u00bb and as early as 1959, Omega\u2019s \u00abConstellation.\u00bb\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Daniel Roth and G\u00e9rald Genta\n\nG\u00e9rald Genta founded his own watch company in 1969, which, after a brief period of Asian ownership, ended up with Bulgari and thus LVMH. A few years ago, LVMH decided to relaunch the brand, known for its expressive designs. Daniel Roth (78), a master watchmaker, was among those who preserved traditional watchmaking craftsmanship through the Quartz Crisis. He has worked for major brands, including many years at Breguet.\n\nIn 1988, Daniel Roth launched his own watch brand, whose elegantly distinctive mechanical timepieces in their signature elliptical gold cases unmistakably reflect Breguet\u2019s aesthetic codes. The Daniel Roth brand was acquired by Bulgari in 2000 and disappeared from the market until two years ago, when it was revived under the guidance of Michel Navas and Enrico Barbasini at Louis Vuitton\u2019s Geneva-based Fabrique du Temps, with the support of Roth himself.\n\nLouis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., and L'\u00c9p\u00e9e join the stage\n\nDaniel Roth\u2019s \u00abExtra Plat Souscription\u00bb and G\u00e9rald Genta\u2019s extravagant \u00abGentissima Oursin Fire Opal\u00bb were both unveiled at LVMH Watch Week.\n\nFor the first time, this year\u2019s event also included brands Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., and L\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e 1839. LVMH acquired the Del\u00e9mont-based maker of mechanical table clocks and extraordinary timepieces last year, while Tiffany & Co. had already been purchased in 2021 for over $16 billion.\n\nFrom four to nine\n\nThe group's watch portfolio has thus grown to nine brands. L\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e enriches the watch world in 2025 with a mechanical storage and presentation box made of acrylic glass, while Tiffany & Co. honors legendary French designer Jean Schlumberger (1907\u20131987) with jewelry watches featuring his signature ornamentation.\n\nLouis Vuitton, in turn, presented the nostalgically styled \u00abTambour Convergence\u00bb table clock and a new version of the \u00abTambour Spin Time,\u00bb the haute horlogerie timepiece that marked the brand\u2019s entry into watchmaking in 2009. As different as the presented novelties are, they share one thing in common: noble materials, sophisticated technical features, and prices that climb steeply.\n\n1 Playful Mechanics\n\nTwo mainspring barrels provide power for an impressive ten-day power reserve, displayed on a digital indicator. Inspired by model construction systems like Meccano, this watch offers a stage for micro-mechanics and creative engineering.\n\n\n\nHublot \u00abBig Bang Meca-10\u00bb (42 mm) in King Gold, skeletonized dial, in-house manual-winding movement with 10-day power reserve, 38,900 francs (Image: Courtesy)\n\n2 Creative Complication\n\nInspired by split-flap display boards at airports and train stations, the master watchmakers of Fabrique du Temps have achieved a never-before-seen interpretation of the traditional jumping hour display. \u00abTaiko\u00bb refers to Japanese ceremonial drums.\n\n\n\nLouis Vuitton \u00abTambour Taiko Spin Time\u00bb (39.5 mm) in white gold, dolphin-gray dial with light gray rotating cubes for jumping hour display, new version of the brand\u2019s first haute horlogerie watch from 2009, 79,500 francs (Image: Courtesy)\n\n3 Noble Niche\n\nFounded in 1988, Daniel Roth is a relatively young watch brand that has already seen its share of ups and downs, including acquisitions and a temporary discontinuation of operations. All the more remarkable, then, that these refined timepieces are now experiencing a renaissance under the umbrella of Louis Vuitton and the watchful eye of their founder.\n\n\n\nDaniel Roth \u00abExtra Plat Souscription\u00bb (38.6 x 35.5 mm) in yellow gold, hand-guilloch\u00e9 gold dial, mechanical in-house manual movement, assembled by master watchmakers at Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton, 45,000 francs (Image: Courtesy)\n\n4 Full Speed Ahead\n\nDuring the demanding Monte Carlo Rally in 1965, Porsche astonished the world with a slightly modified version of its newly launched 911 model, securing top positions. The timing was measured using precision instruments from Heuer. The new chronograph pays homage to this glorious era.\n\n\n\nTag Heuer \u00abCarrera Chronosprint x Porsche Rallye\u00bb (42 mm) in stainless steel or yellow gold, automatic chronograph movement, domed glassbox sapphire crystal, perforated calf leather strap, 10,000 or 24,000 francs (Image: Courtesy)\n\n5 Upgrade\n\nIn 1948, Bulgari launched its iconic \u00abSerpenti\u00bb watch design\u2014an era when quartz movements were not yet available. At the time, the watches featured fine automatic movements. It makes perfect sense for the brand to return to its original spirit with a new, fully in-house developed and manufactured automatic movement from its Le Sentier workshop.\n\n\n\nBulgari \u00abSerpenti Seduttori\u00bb (35 mm) in yellow gold with diamonds, new in-house automatic movement Lady Solotempo BVS100, price upon request (Image: Courtesy)\n\n6 Transparency\n\nThe art of skeletonizing movements and dials has been a long-standing tradition in the watch industry. With this model, Zenith takes a modern and artistic approach to this classic finishing technique.\n\nZenith \u00abDefy Skyline Chronograph Skeleton\u00bb (42 mm) in stainless steel, El Primero automatic movement, skeletonized movement and openworked dial, delivered with both steel and rubber straps, 14,900 francs (Image: Courtesy)\n\n7 Flamboyant\n\nNot just sleek steel watches: the sea urchin (French \u00abOursin\") is a brilliant example of G\u00e9rald Genta\u2019s love for vibrant colors and precious gemstones.\n\n\n\nG\u00e9rald Genta \u00abGentissima Oursin Fire Opal\u00bb (36.5 mm) in yellow gold with fire opal beads, cornelian dial, automatic movement, alligator leather strap, price upon request (Image: Courtesy)\n\n8 Blue Hour\n\nThe highlight of this jewelry watch is the rotating dial ring with golden cross-stitch details. The iconic cross-stitch motif is a reference to Jean Schlumberger\u2019s heritage in an Alsatian textile dynasty.\n\n\n\nTiffany & Co. \u00abJean Schlumberger Twenty Four Stone\u00bb (39 mm) in white and yellow gold with diamonds, mechanical automatic movement, alligator strap in Tiffany Blue\u00ae, price upon request (Image: Courtesy)",

Over the last eleven years, I have been lucky enough to be surrounded by people with the imagination, the skills, tenacity and resourcefulness to find a way to say \u2018yes\u2019 to all my wildly ambitious ideas.\u201d\n\nDuring his tenure with the 179-year-old house, Anderson helped to raise its profile from quiet luxury stalwart to must-have fashion brand.\n\nIn addition to being a sponsor of the 2024 Met Gala, Loewe also landed in the top spot of the Lyst Index\u2019s quarterly ranking for most-wanted brand for the first time in 2023. The brand returned to the No. 1 position again the following year after its looks in the popular \u201cChallengers\u201d movie helped it overtake Miu Miu in the second quarter of 2024. Also last year, Time Magazine named Anderson one of its 100 Most Influential People.\n\nPrior to joining Loewe, Anderson was focused on his namesake label, JW Anderson, which he founded in 2008 and still controls. LVMH acquired a minority stake in that label in 2013, the same year it named Anderson creative director at Loewe.\n\nWhile Anderson didn\u2019t announce his next move, rumors have been swirling for months that he is eyeing the top spot at Dior. Kim Jones recently left his position as creative director at Dior Men.\n\nThere have been a dizzying number of creative director shifts over the past year as the luxury industry scrambles to reshape itself amid waning consumer demand.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, LVMH posted a 2% year-over-year revenue decline. Profit from recurring operations fell 14% for the year, and the company\u2019s largest division, fashion and leather goods, posted a revenue decrease of 3%. The company does not report separate financial figures for individual brands.",

Three years ago, the maximum age limit was raised from 75 to 80. Arnault is now 76 and thus seems to want to stay at the head of the company for years to come.\n\nThere has been much speculation recently about the top executive\u2019s possible succession by one of his five children: Delphine, Antoine, Alexandre, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Jean already hold senior positions in the company today.

            "content": "It\u2019s no secret that attracting and keeping retail talent is becoming ever more difficult. To tackle this challenge, luxury giant LVMH\u2019s North American division has taken its recruiting efforts straight to the source \u2014 colleges and universities.\n\n\u201cAt LVMH, we believe that our people are our greatest asset, and the longevity of our brands depends on attracting the most talented and passionate individuals,\u201d said Gena Smith, Chief Human Resources Officer at LVMH North America in comments shared with Retail TouchPoints. \u201cTo engage the next generation of leaders, we prioritize top-tier programs that reflect our core values of creativity, innovation and excellence, while showcasing the diverse career paths available within the luxury industry. We aim to inspire and connect with those who dream of a future in luxury, helping them transform those dreams into fulfilling careers.\u201d\n\nThe way LVMH does this is multi-faceted \u2014 from the more traditional approach of internship programs to deeper engagements such as an eight-week online certification, dedicated courses to prepare students for careers in the luxury industry and a wide-reaching Student Ambassador scholarship program at schools across the country.\n\n\u201cConnecting with students at the outset of their career journey provides us with a unique opportunity to underscore the wide and unique range of career opportunities LVMH offers,\u201d said Jasmine Humphrey, Director of Campus and Cultural Engagement at LVMH in an interview with Retail TouchPoints.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s a peek inside LVMH\u2019s forward-looking approach to talent development.\n\nStudent Ambassadors Boost LVMH\u2019s Profile and Attract Other Talent\n\nEvery year LVMH selects a slate of diverse students from across the country to serve as LVMH ambassadors on their campuses. These ambassadors receive a one-year scholarship of $5,000, and in exchange they play a pivotal role in enhancing the LVMH brand among their fellow students by sharing their experiences, insights and passion for luxury. They do this by hosting on-campus engagements, participating in strategic social media initiatives, attending LVMH events and more. As an added perk, Ambassadors are trained at a three-day onsite in New York in early summer, with travel and accommodations covered by LVMH.\n\nThis year the coveted roles are open to U.S. college or university students graduating in 2027 with a minimum GPA of 3.5 and a demonstrated passion for the luxury industry. \u201cWe seek well-rounded individuals who are passionate about luxury savoir-faire, possess leadership skills, are creative and innovative thinkers, have effective communication and can demonstrate an entrepreneurial mindset,\u201d said Humphrey. \u201cEssentially, we\u2019re looking for students who embody the values of LVMH and are eager to share their enthusiasm with others.\u201d\n\nIn addition to raising the profile of LVMH and its many maisons (or brands) \u2014 which include Tiffany & Co., Louis Vuitton, Sephora, Mo\u00ebt Hennessy and others \u2014 Student Ambassadors also raise awareness of the other career development opportunities available with the company.\n\nFree Online Training that Evolves with the Luxury Industry\n\nImage courtesy LVMH\n\nOne of the biggest opportunities that Ambassadors make their classmates aware of is the Inside LVMH guided training and insights platform, a free online resource launched in 2016 that provides access to luxury education and in-depth knowledge about the luxury sector. Students also can take an eight-week certification course to boost their profile when they begin their job hunt after college.\n\nThe courses available on the platform teach both theoretical and practical knowledge and feature experts from LVMH and the luxury industry, as well as professors from renowned schools including HEC Paris, Bocconi, Institut Fran\u00e7ais de la Mode, Harvard, Central Saint Martins and CentraleSupelec. Courses cover everything from background on LVMH and the luxury industry as a whole to retail experience, branding, operations and supply chain.\n\n\u201cStudents and early career individuals should possess a proficiency in basic luxury principles, consumer behavior and navigating ambiguity,\u201d said Humphrey. \u201cThey should also be agile, culturally aware and passionate about delivering exceptional experiences. In today\u2019s luxury landscape, a combination of strong business acumen, creativity, customer-centricity and digital fluency is essential.\n\n\u201cWhile the fundamentals of luxury remain constant, we continually adapt our engagement strategies to reflect current trends and challenges within the industry,\u201d she added. \u201cWe address topics such as retail innovation, digital transformation, evolving consumer behaviors and the impact of economic fluctuations. This ensures that our programs remain relevant and prepare students for the dynamic landscape of the luxury sector that will no doubt continue to grow and evolve.\u201d\n\nAnd this focus on training continues well beyond school for those who end up working at LVMH: \u201cWe also have accelerated our training programs at all levels of the organization in the past few years to deliver a more bespoke offering, from leadership skill trainings to apprenticeship and mentorship programs,\u201d said Humphrey. \u201cWe often create programming that responds to their interests \u2014 from data and AI to supply chain, leadership and management skills. We\u2019ve found that this approach resonates with our talent and creates a foundation for impactful employee engagement, retention and innovation.\u201d\n\nFocusing in on the Convergence of Luxury Branding and Art\n\nIn addition to its online courses, LVMH also has co-developed an immersive course at Spelman College in Atlanta that blends concepts of luxury branding and art curation to prepare students for careers in the luxury and creative industries.\n\nCourse highlights include an exploration of:\n\nHow top brands like Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co. and Dior use art to shape their identity;\n\nuse art to shape their identity; How curating art enhances brand storytelling and customer experiences;\n\nThe various career roles available in retail, branding, creative direction and marketing;\n\nImmersions to New York City and Paris sponsored by LVMH; and\n\nThe chance to engage with LVMH mentors and explore career and internship opportunities.\n\n\u201cLuxury brands often leverage art to enhance their brand storytelling, create unique customer experiences and shape their overall identity,\u201d explained Humphrey. \u201cThe Spelman College course recognizes this synergy, exploring how curatorial skills can be applied within the luxury retail context. By understanding the intersection of art and luxury, students gain a deeper appreciation for brand building, visual merchandising and the creation of compelling narratives that resonate with discerning consumers.\u201d\n\nNothing Like the Tried-and-True Internship\n\nStudents at an LVMH Intern Day. (Image courtesy LVMH)\n\nAs all college students know, there\u2019s no better \u201cin\u201d at a company than an internship, and LVMH delivers with 10-week-long programs that give students the chance to dive into the luxury industry waters at some of the company\u2019s top maisons.\n\nA year-long paid LVMH Legal Fellowship Program also grants two lucky law school grads the unique experience of being exposed to all major sectors of the luxury industry through the four pillars of the LVMH legal department: strategy and operations; commercial, IP and real estate; litigation and employment; and regulatory and privacy.\n\n\u201cOur early engagement with potential talent gives us a competitive edge in attracting top-tier candidates,\u201d said Humphrey. \u201cIt helps us identify future leaders, enhances internal mobility, builds a pipeline of qualified candidates for internships and full-time positions and fosters a sense of community around the LVMH brand.\u201d",

            "content": "Bernard Arnault Looks To Extend LVMH Tenure To 85 Years Strategic leadership reshuffles signal family's growing influence within the luxury conglomerate.\n\nLuxury conglomerate LVMH Moe8t Hennessy Louis Vuitton is witnessing significant management changes as veteran CEO Bernard Arnault pushes to extend the age limit for his tenure as head of the company. A resolution to increase this limit to 85 years will be presented to shareholders during the annual general meeting scheduled for April 17, 2025. This follows shareholdersbc agreement last year to raise the limit from 75 to 80 years, indicating the companycs commitment to Arnault's continued leadership.\n\nAt 76, Arnault has not shown any intentions to retire, opting instead to solidify his family's presence at LVMH. This move aligns with his vision of maintaining the company as family-led. LVMH recently reported sales of 84.7 billion euros, demonstrating the brand's extraordinary performance under Arnault's direction.\n\nThe upcoming AGM will not only address Arnault's tenure but also the appointment of his sons to influential positions within the company. Alexandre Arnault, who has been promoted to deputy CEO of Moe9t Hennessy, and Fre9de9ric Arnault, soon to be appointed as CEO of Loro Piana, are indicative of the Arnault family's tight-knit control over LVMH. The elevation of these key family members demonstrates the Arnaults' strategy to nurture leadership within their ranks, thereby strengthening their hold over one of the most valuable luxury brands globally.\n\nFre9de9ric Arnault, 30, is expected to take the helm of Loro Piana on June 10, 2025, succeeding Damien Bertrand, who will transition to Deputy Managing Director of Louis Vuitton and become part of LVMH's Executive Committee by January 2026. This change is not only pivotal for Loro Piana, which has become one of the group's significant brands since its acquisition by LVMH in 2013, but also reflects Arnault's broader intentions to position his sons strategically within the luxury market.\n\nAccording to industry reports, Loro Piana boasts impressive revenue of around 2.5 billion euros, ranking it as the third-largest brand under the luxury umbrella, closely following Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior. The company's operations will now be guided by Fre9de9ric, whose previous experience includes leading Tag Heuer and managing other divisions within LVMH. His leadership is believed to be integral to the brand's future success and adherence to the upscale market, particularly as competition intensifies.\n\nBernard Arnault has emphasized several times the nature of LVMH as not just another business but as inherently family-run. The Arnault family maintains significant stakes, owning 49 percent of the companycs share capital and 64.8 percent of its voting rights. By steering his sons toward key leadership roles, Arnault is clearly fortifying the family\u2019s presence, ensuring decisions align with their overall vision for the luxury brand. This consolidation of power within the family was evident during last year's AGM when shareholders approved Alexandre and Fre9de9ric's appointments to the board, enhancing their visibility and involvement with LVMH's future direction.\n\nDespite some external speculation about Bernard Arnault's retirement plans, the recent series of management reshuffles do not suggest immediate changes at the helm. Instead, these moves are part of Arnault's broader strategy to groom his successors gradually and manage the interests of the luxury group comprehensively. Observers speculate the leadership discussion surrounding Arnault will extend at least until 2034, highlighting his long-term commitment to the company.\n\nMeanwhile, some analysts posit these organizational changes reflect LVMH's strength and adaptability as one of the premier luxury houses globally. Pierre-Emmanuel Angeloglou, CEO of Christian Dior Couture, is transitioning to lead Fendi, reflecting the overall dynamic structure within LVMH aimed at producing new leaders capable of sustaining the brand's legacy. Therefore, the future execution of this plan will likely intertwine closely with how the Arnault family orchestrates its influence over time, showcasing how deeply family ties inform the operations and governance within LVMH.\n\nWith the AGM on the horizon, stakeholders will be closely monitoring the developments concerning Arnault's proposed age limit changes and the new appointments of his sons, all of which represent not just personal milestones but also strategic maneuvers for the company's future. The upcoming decisions will likely have lasting consequences for LVMH, potentially influencing other luxury brands to revisit their governance and succession strategies as market dynamics continue to evolve.\n\nThe Arnault family's embrace of both tradition and innovation may well lay the foundation for LVMH to sustain its significant market position and respond effectively to the changing landscapes of the luxury sector.",

            "content": "Originally a wool merchant, Loro Piana began as a textile mill, exporting high-end fabrics to Europe, Japan, and the Americas. Renowned for its extra-fine wool, cashmere, and vicu\u00f1a, the company did not enter the ready-to-wear and luxury goods market until the 1980s. It is fair to say it hasn\u2019t looked back since.\n\nBy the time LVMH acquired an 80 percent stake in 2013 for 2 billion euros, Loro Piana was already a substantial business. Though its cashmere products were once considered somewhat staid and largely geared toward Asian consumers, the brand offered a unique proposition\u2014one less susceptible to the shifting tides of consumer trends and market volatility than many of its competitors.\n\nToday, Loro Piana is a quiet powerhouse within LVMH\u2019s fashion division. In 2023, it reported sales of 2.4 billion euros, ranking among the group\u2019s top-performing brands. With its fiercely loyal clientele and ultra-luxury positioning, Loro Piana is more akin to Herm\u00e8s than a traditional fashion house\u2014a comparison that incoming CEO Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault is undoubtedly aware of.\n\nUnlike other fashion maisons, Loro Piana\u2019s textile division remains a highly lucrative enterprise, supplying luxury fashion houses, private clients, interior designers, and the high-end hospitality sector. Its core business has always been textiles and exclusive yarns rather than finished garments.\n\nOpportunities for growth\n\nThis, of course, presents significant opportunities for growth. Some argue that Loro Piana has the potential to become the Herm\u00e8s of the LVMH fashion division. However, unlike Herm\u00e8s, it lacks a signature handbag\u2014a defining product that fuels desirability and resale value. Accessories, particularly handbags and footwear, could be key growth drivers if executed with precision.\n\nNotably, there is no star designer behind Loro Piana\u2019s ready-to-wear collections. The company has kept a low profile in its hiring strategy, opting for a Chief Product Officer rather than an Artistic Director, and collaborating seasonally with stylists. Paul Surridge, who had been a consulting menswear designer, recently departed to lead menswear at Prada\u2014a notable loss for the brand.\n\nMr. Arnault may look to streamline and realign Loro Piana\u2019s design and product teams, fostering greater synergy and efficiency\u2014something that, beyond the bottom line, often leads to a more cohesive creative vision and a happier workforce. Yet his most critical challenge will be maintaining sustainable growth. Like Herm\u00e8s, Loro Piana must prioritise measured, long-term expansion over trend-driven hype, avoiding the kind of rapid ascent seen at Gucci under Alessandro Michele.\n\nThe brand\u2019s understated marketing and controlled production have already created an aura of exclusivity akin to the Herm\u00e8s Birkin strategy, where scarcity fuels desirability. Here, craftsmanship and discretion remain paramount. Though recent collaborations with brands like New Balance have broadened its appeal, Loro Piana must be careful not to overextend itself. Scaling up too aggressively could erode its exclusivity\u2014a risk LVMH will likely be keen to avoid.\n\nPricing and positioning will remain critical. Loro Piana cashmere sweaters start at around 1,000 euros while handbags begin at 1,900 euros. Some of its coats exceed 10,000 euros, firmly placing the brand in the ultra-luxury tier.\n\nStill, Herm\u00e8s enjoys a far stronger global presence and a more diversified product range, spanning leather goods, scarves, homeware, and beyond. Loro Piana remains more niche, rooted in its textile heritage. The question now is how Mr. Arnault will drive growth while preserving the brand\u2019s DNA\u2014and whether Loro Piana can truly emerge as a rival to Herm\u00e8s.",

            "content": "The Upcoming Resolution Proposes Raising the Retirement Age for CEOs to 85\n\nBernard Arnault, the influential figure at the helm of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has once again signaled his intention to extend the age limit for CEOs at the luxury conglomerate. An upcoming resolution, expected to be submitted at the annual general meeting scheduled for April 17, proposes raising the retirement age to 85. This most recent development resonates with Arnault\u2019s prior motives, indicating no immediate intention of stepping down from his managerial role at 76.\n\nDespite recurrent rumors about potential handovers, a resolution in 2022 that saw the company\u2019s bylaws stretch the CEO\u2019s age limit to 80 from 75 reaffirms Arnault\u2019s commitment to the role. This confirmation, voted in favor of by shareholders, suggests that for at least the near future, the stalwart CEO is set to retain the reins.\n\nLVMH, the world\u2019s leading luxury group, has seen several management reshuffles in recent years that have fortified the Arnault family\u2019s dominion over its leadership. The conglomerate\u2019s annual assembly last year witnessed shareholders virtually unanimously endorsing the induction of Arnault\u2019s sons, Alexandre and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, as board directors.\n\nAlexandre has subsequently risen to the position of deputy CEO at Mo\u00ebt Hennessy in the enterprise\u2019s wines and spirits division, while Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric is slated to assume the role of CEO at Loro Piana. Older siblings Antoine and Delphine Arnault, who are already holding significant roles at LVMH and Christian Dior Couture respectively, alongside their youngest brother Jean Arnault, who is Louis Vuitton\u2019s director of watches, leave no ambiguity about the role of the family in the corporation.\n\nEmphasizing the familial nature of his enterprise, Arnault often refers to the luxury giant as a family business. The Arnault family\u2019s holding company, Groupe Arnault, holds considerable weight in the company, owning 49% of LVMH\u2019s share capital and commanding 64.8 percent of the voting rights. With their most recent sales figures reaching 84.7 billion euros in 2024, their influence is evidenced not only in boardroom clout but also in the conglomerate\u2019s immense financial dimension.",

After interning for Facebook\u2019s AI department in New York, he joined Tag Heuer in 2017, then led by industry veteran Jean-Claude Biver. Executive St\u00e9phane Bianchi arrived in 2018 as CEO of Tag Heuer and of the watchmaking division, then was promoted to CEO of LVMH\u2019s watches and jewellery division in 2020, leaving Arnault to take over Tag Heuer. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric became CEO of the watch brand in 2020, and in January 2024, was appointed CEO of LVMH Watches in charge of Tag Heuer, Hublot and Zenith. He also joined the LVMH board last year. His track record in the last year includes the acquisition of L\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e 1839, a Switzerland-based manufacturer of high-end clocks and the strengthening of the LVMH Watch Week as well as LVMH\u2019s decade-long partnership with Formula One through Tag Heuer\u2019s role as the official timekeeper.\n\nThe roles of the Arnault family within the LVMH empire have been reshaped in recent years: Delphine Arnault was named chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture in January 2023; Antoine Arnault has been overseeing the group\u2019s communications and environmental issues since 2018 and chairman of Loro Piana since LVMH acquired it in 2013. He has also served as chief executive of the family holding company, Christian Dior SE, since December 2022; Alexandre Arnault, who headed up product and communications at Tiffany & Co, in February became deputy CEO of the wine and spirits division, which includes champagne houses like Mo\u00ebt & Chandon and cognac brand Hennessy. Jean Arnault is watch director of Louis Vuitton.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric joins Loro Piana at a good time: the brand, which turned 100 last year, is strategically positioned in the very high-end segment. It has become a poster child for the quiet luxury trend, especially on the back of the prominent display of its wares in Succession, the hit HBO TV series. Back in 2023, Antoine Arnault was somewhat dismissive of the concept of quiet luxury \u2014 at least the \u201cquiet\u201d part. \u201cI don\u2019t see Loro Piana as a quiet brand. It\u2019s a house that innovates. We are doing more events, more on social media, etc. If you go to the store, it\u2019s a vibrant brand. For me, \u2018quiet\u2019 is a synonym of \u2018boring\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s not boring at all,\u201d he insisted. In late 2024, Loro Piana took over the window display at Harrods.\n\nLVMH doesn\u2019t break down sales of individual houses but stressed \u201ca remarkable performance\u201d in its annual earnings statement. Depending on analyst estimates, sales at Loro Piana were between \u20ac2 billion and \u20ac3 billion in 2024. They were approximately \u20ac700 million in 2013 when LVMH acquired 80 per cent of the Italian house for \u20ac2 billion.\n\nComments, questions or feedback?

            "content": "Further fortifying management at its largest brands via internal promotions, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton has named Damien Bertrand deputy chief executive officer of Louis Vuitton, and Pierre-Emmanuel Angeloglou as deputy CEO of Christian Dior Couture.\n\nBertrand, currently CEO of Loro Piana, will be succeeded by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, currently CEO of LVMH Watches, which comprises Tag Heuer, Hublot and Zenith.\n\nArnault, the second youngest of LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault\u2019s five children, is to join Loro Piana on March 26 for a transition period with Betrand, who starts at Vuitton on June 10, and also becomes a member of LVMH\u2019s executive committee.\n\nThe trio of appointments underscores how the French luxury giant largely prefers to groom and promote talent from within, and is in the throes of stacking its marquee brands with younger, accomplished executives, some of whom will be reunited with former bosses.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nBertrand, who worked at Christian Dior Couture from 2016 to 2021 as managing director in charge of the women\u2019s, men\u2019s and baby\u2019s business units, will be reunited with Pietro Beccari, who helmed Dior before becoming chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton in 2023. Before LVMH, Bertrand was an 18-year veteran of French beauty giant L\u2019Or\u00e9al.\n\nAnd Angeloglou, another L\u2019Or\u00e9al executive who joined Vuitton in 2019 as strategic missions director for fashion and leather goods and later named executive vice president, will be reunited with Delphine Arnault, who left Vuitton to become chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture in 2023 as part of a big management shuffle at the top of that year.\n\nCommenting on the appointments on Wednesday, Bernard Arnault said, \u201cOur maisons\u2019 desirability is fueled by dedicated and passionate leaders. Damien, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Pierre-Emmanuel\u2019s vision, entrepreneurial spirit, creativity and commitment to excellence will be assets to pursue the dynamic development of our maisons.\n\n\u201cThese three nominations also reflect our group\u2019s ability to craft careers,\u201d he added.\n\nThe management shuffle also sets the stage for a new manager-designer duo at Fendi.\n\nAngeloglou, who became managing director of LVMH Fashion Group in March 2024 overseeing Fendi, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, Pucci, Stella McCartney, Patou and Off-White, was additionally named CEO of the Roman fashion house last May.\n\nLast October, Kim Jones stepped down as Fendi\u2019s artistic director of haute couture, ready-to-wear and fur collections for women, leaving Silvia Venturini Fendi to spearhead the coed Fendi show last month during Milan Fashion Week that kicked off centenary celebrations.\n\nAngeloglou is to move over to Christian Dior Couture on April 15, reporting to Delphine Arnault.\n\nHis successors at LVMH Fashion Group and Fendi were not mentioned in Wednesday\u2019s press release.\n\nHowever, according to sources, Ramon Ros, currently president and CEO of Louis Vuitton China, is considered a top contender for the Fendi role.\n\nAngeloglou is the latest CEO-level executive to arrive at Dior under Delphine Arnault, demonstrating the gravitational pull of today\u2019s luxury behemoths.\n\nLast year, Benedetta Petruzzo, previously CEO of Miu Miu, joined Christian Dior Couture as managing director, while Montblanc\u2019s CEO Nicolas Baretzki came on board as deputy managing director.\n\nAccording to LVMH, Angeloglou is to work alongside Arnault overseeing commercial activities, industrial, finance and legal.\n\n\u201cHis capacity to articulate a compelling vision, coupled with an empowerment of the teams, will be key assets for Christian Dior Couture\u2019s development and desirability,\u201d the release said.\n\nOne of LVMH\u2019s stealthiest brands, Loro Piana, doesn\u2019t have a star creative director, stage fashion shows or do collaborations.\n\nBut it has become the third-largest business in the fashion and leather goods division behind Vuitton and Dior, with market sources estimating it generates revenues of about 2.5 billion euros.\n\nIt is understood the brand\u2019s profits are now at the level of revenues when LVMH acquired the brand in 2013, with Antoine Arnault becoming chairman and leading its integration into the group.\n\nBertrand, who came on board in 2021, focused on brand elevation, product quality and savoir-faire to position the brand as the \u201cmaster of fibers.\u201d It sources vicu\u00f1a from Peru, cashmere from Mongolia, and the finest, rarest wools from New Zealand and Australia.\n\nThe executive brought the menswear and womenswear closer, developing the collections together, and further elaborated on Loro Piana\u2019s push into leather goods and homewares.\n\nAt Vuitton, he is to focus on industrial product creation and development, brand image and communication, according to LVMH.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault joins Loro Piana at a time when the brand is said to be logging double-digit growth, fueled partly by an enduring trend toward quiet luxury. He officially starts June 10 and will report to Toni Belloni, chairman of LVMH Italy.\n\nAccording to LVMH, Arnault will \u201cbuild on his passion for exceptional quality and his leadership skills to pursue Loro Piana to the highest level of excellence, while ensuring the maison stays true to its unique savoir-faire.\u201d\n\nThe executive is best known for his tenure at Tag Heuer, which he joined in 2017 to manage its smartwatch activities before becoming chief strategy and digital officer and, ultimately, CEO in 2020.\n\nHe became head of LVMH watches a year ago, with a big focus on streamlining and optimizing the industrial backdrop crucial to Swiss watchmaking. He lead the the acquisition of clockmaker L\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e 1839 and its parent company Swiza, bringing unique know-how into the group.\n\nArnault also played a key role in developing the 10-year global partnership between LVMH and Formula 1.\n\nLVMH said Arnault\u2019s successor as CEO of LVMH Watches will be announced shortly.",

Poised between platforms, the women crown their looks with an array of headwear, from turbans and wool ushanka hats to exaggerated bucket hats.

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A rush by European governments to boost military spending has unleashed a rally in defense stocks so strong that they\u2019re now as richly valued as the region\u2019s high-flying luxury names.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nShares in German tanks and ammunition producer Rheinmetall AG have jumped more than 90% this year. That\u2019s pushed its valuation multiple to a record, somewhere between Dior owner LVMH and Birkin bag maker Herm\u00e8s International SCA.\n\nOther European defense stocks including Thales SA and Leonardo SpA have also soared. The test now is whether the companies can live up to the earnings growth expectations investors have placed on them, to match the headspinning advance in their share prices. That intensifies the focus on Rheinmetall\u2019s results, due Wednesday.\n\nBulls base their confidence on Germany\u2019s newly announced pledge to unlock hundreds of billions of euros for military spending and its push for European Union leaders to follow suit. Defense shares rose on Tuesday after Germany\u2019s Green party said it was prepared to reach an agreement as soon as this week and pave the way for a deal. It\u2019s a shift that turns an historically low-growth corner of the stock market into one that has the potential to rapidly expand.\n\nValuations for defense stocks have raced ahead as investors snap up the shares much faster than analysts have managed to rework their price targets to account for an anticipated rush of government orders.\n\n\u201cThe growth outlook for these companies is very different today than it was six months ago,\u201d Graeme Bencke, a fund manager at Amati Global Investors, said in an interview. \u201cWe need to expect that they look expensive right now because the market and the Street haven\u2019t really had a chance to upgrade earnings.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s clear evidence that analysts haven\u2019t kept up with the breakneck rally. While Rheinmetall\u2019s average price-target has shot up by more than 60% since the start of the year, it suggests little upside over the next 12 months. The company\u2019s earnings will shine a spotlight on its prospects for the year to come, possibly prompting analysts to lift their expectations.\n\nInvestors are keenly watching which areas within defense will be earmarked by governments for increased spending, as well as guidance from companies, to get a clearer picture of how to value stocks in the sector.",

Double-breasted tuxedo blazers are joined by silk bomber jackets and felted duffle hoodies. Japanese denim jeans showed pink stitching and ballooning diaphanous pants revealed legs. The lingerie-like delicacy features floral prints lifted from archival KENZO swimsuits. Feminine freshness continues in accessories, including bags with shirred handles and ribbon bow detailing.\n\n\n\nMotifs include two mischievous rabbits, \u201cLucky Me\u201d in pink and \u201cLucky You\u201d in pastel blue, bringing a playful touch to the runway. Inspired by a 1979 Kenzo Takada sketch, the whimsical characters came to life in a rabbit adorned vest, rabbit-ear hoodies and sling-back bunny slippers. Meticulous details informed the entire collection. Crystal pav\u00e9 detailing on belt buckles are a nod to streetwear, buttons are hand-carved in tonal mother of pearl, and the linings of tailored jackets meet the exacting specifications of Savile Row. Nothing was left to chance behind the apparent whimsy, including a touching tribute to the KENZO atelier team with a cotton-linen parka embroidered with rainbow autographs of team members.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "The atelier and its intimacy set the tone for this ready-to-wear collection, with a color palette featuring black, white and vibrant yellow. The discovery of Hubert de Givenchy patterns dating from 1952 provided inspiration for Sarah Burton\u2019s creations right from the very first silhouette, starting from the body up. The rhythm of her collection evolves around tailoring, merging masculine techniques with feminine shape. This exploration of the multiple facets of a modern woman proved rich in surprises. A surrealist dress made entirely of powder compacts appeared amidst silhouettes in black leather. Volumes balance strong shoulders and hourglass waists, and bolts of fabric morph into backless dresses or wrap around the body to form skirts.\n\n\n\nSubtle echoes of Hubert de Givenchy punctuate the collection. Chantilly lace dresses are scissored to micro length, elongating the body. Fifties foundational undergarments become visible in provocative conical shapes. Balloon sleeves expand, expressing a powerful femininity. Knotted scarves are translated into exploded leather iterations around the neck, or as graphic signatures at the waist. Couture spirit and the creative energy of the future infuse the silhouettes. Accessories feature shoes designed as objects of desire, from tulle to latex, while the new Pinch and Facet bags are worn day or night. Pearls and crystals embellish earrings, and a jewel-covered bodice celebrates the skin as the most precious of materials.\n\n",

            "content": "This January\u2019s edition of the LVMH Watch Week, held in New York and Paris, was the first time that the LVMH Group has chosen to showcase nine of its brands active in the field of watchmaking: Bulgari, Hublot, Daniel Roth, G\u00e9rald Genta, L'\u00c9p\u00e9e 1839, Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer, Tiffany & Co. and Zenith\n\nAbove and beyond the encounters with the media and partners, representatives of these nine brands were clearly delighted to convene in the same locations. The group encompasses two distinct sets of historical and more recently acquired brands; while at the same time, an industrial strategy with regards to watch movements is clearly taking shape.\n\nOptimism and dynamism\n\nBulgari, Hublot, Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer and Zenith are evidently adopting a proactive approach, with the three brands in the middle of this list of five presenting many new products divided into distinctly structured collections (check them out on our worldtempus.com website). When questioned regarding 2025, Hublot CEO Julien Tornare said: \u201cFirst of all, I would like to be optimistic and as it happens, the end of 2024 and the start of 2025 have been better than expected. I'm working on the assumption that the economic context will remain complex during the year, but that it will improve and that our redeployment will give Hublot the momentum required to make a success of 2025 despite the economic situation \u2013 with a real upturn in 2026.\u201d*\n\nBenoit de Clerck, CEO of Zenith, which is celebrating its 160th anniversary this year, is enthusiastic yet realistic: \u201cLike most of the watch industry, we\u2019ve faced some turbulence in recent months, although having an integrated Manufacture has helped us navigate our way through it. Our 2025 goal is to maintain focus on our core priorities while leveraging our 160th anniversary. We have some exciting projects planned that showcase Zenith\u2019s authenticity and expertise. While Zenith is not the only centenarian watchmaker, we are unique in that we\u2019ve occupied the same premises for 160 years, continuing to produce watches throughout that time. Visitors can still see the original furniture and tools from our founding era, making our Manufacture truly one-of-a-kind. *\n\nDEFY Skyline Chronograph Skeleton \u00a9 Zenith\n\nAs for Bulgari, Jean-Christophe Babin evokes a record year in 2024 despite the economic situation and is strengthening the brand's manufacturing autonomy with the creation of a 1.9 cm-diameter automatic caliber for small watches, which could be made available to other brands within the group. Moreover, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, CEO of the LVMH Watch Division, confirms his intention to invest in the development of movement production for his brands, capitalizing on Manufacture Zenith\u2019s capabilities and expertise.\n\nThe redeployment of new entrants\n\nRelaunched in 2023 under the leadership of the Louis Vuitton Fabrique du Temps and highly prized by collectors, the Daniel Roth and G\u00e9rald Genta brands are consolidating the achievements of their new lease on life. Both have presented a reinterpretation in a very limited series, aiming for peak Haute Horlogerie through their finishes. Another niche brand and the most recently acquired by LVMH, L'\u00c9p\u00e9e 1839 has seen its reputation skyrocket thanks to unprecedented media exposure. The Jura-based Manufacture, which had brought along part of its collection of highly creative clocks and mechanical accessories, unveiled a transparent case for the first time. Since its acquisition by LVMH last year, L'\u00c9p\u00e9e 1839 has embarked on an expansion of its Manufacture. Discover this mechanical gem by taking part in our next GMT Watch Safari.\n\nFinally, in a completely different dimension, Tiffany & Co. organized an exhibition of historical items and a presentation of very successful new women's products across all price ranges, the first of this magnitude since the acquisition of the brand by LVMH in 2019. Nicolas Beau, Vice-President of Tiffany Horlogerie since 2021, was visibly pleased with this creative achievement. Whether exceptional timepieces combining Haute Horlogerie and Haute Joaillerie or watches costing a few thousand francs, each one is derived from a piece of Tiffany jewelry. While the subject was not raised at all, could it be that the next LVMH Watch Week will comprise ten brands?\n\nJean Schlumberger by Tiffany Bird on a Rock Tsavorite watch \u00a9 Tiffany & Co.\n\n*Discover more than 30 articles relating to the LVMH Watch Week on WorldTempus, including interviews with CEOs Antoine Pin (TAG Heuer), Benoit de Clerck (Zenith) and Julien Tornare (Hublot).",

Ostensibly a season launch centred around introducing the cars and drivers set to line up on the grid throughout the championship\u2019s 75th anniversary season, the event was, in reality, the F1\u2019s grandest marketing exercise yet: an Oscars-like showcase for a revitalised and increasingly image-conscious sport. Celebrities mingled with drivers on the red carpet, each cohort styled to the nines, before settling down at tables for a formal presentation as a live crowd of 20,000 watched on \u2013 the teams took turns presenting their 2025 contenders in an elaborate stage show. It was motorsport\u2019s answer to a blockbuster film premiere, with shades of the Met Gala and The Hunger Games\u2019 tribute ceremony thrown in for good measure \u2013 viewed online by a YouTube audience of more than a million people.\n\nPlaced strategically throughout the festivities were nods to the most valuable sponsorship deal Formula 1 has ever signed: a billion-dollar, decade-long agreement that will see luxury conglomerate LVMH imprint its own image, and branding, on the sport\u2019s races and teams. For LVMH, which is owned by the Arnault family, the deal marks the next phase of a wider shift: to place the company at the epicentre of the Venn diagram where sport and luxury converge. For F1 owners Liberty Media, who bought the group in 2017, it represents the culmination of eight years reviving a series that had lost both a considerable amount of viewers and, through a combination of mismanagement, scandal and economic headwinds, much of the glamour of its late-20th century heyday.\n\nAs the drivers watched the showcase play out, conspicuously opting for water over champagne (it was pre-season, after all), bottles of LVMH-owned Mo\u00ebt & Chandon sat proudly in ice buckets perched on each table. When F1 CEO Stefano Domincali addressed attendees and viewers at home in a vignette, a cool blue timepiece from TAG Heuer, which this year replaced Rolex as the sport\u2019s official timekeeper, twinkled on his wrist. A leather-clad Louis Vuitton trophy trunk, adorned in the fashion house\u2019s signature monogram and holding the World Championship Drivers\u2019 Trophy, dominated the frame behind him. \u2018Victory Travels in Louis Vuitton\u2019, a plinth holding the trunk boldly declared.\n\nThis year, the first stop on that trunk\u2019s 10-month, 24-race voyage is the Australian Grand Prix \u2013 a milestone event not just as Melbourne returns to its traditional role as the setting of the season opener, but as the first major branding experiment of this eye-catching new partnership. Incidentally, after decades aligned with Australian legacy brands like Qantas and Fosters, it\u2019s now named the Louis Vuitton Australian Grand Prix \u2013 the first time a fashion house has ever served as the title sponsor of a Grand Prix.",

Nevertheless, he had to testify during Squarcini\u2019s November trial and told the court that he was entirely unaware of the illegal surveillance ordered by a \u201ctrusted associate\u201d who died in 2018.\n\nBenjamin Sarfati, Ruffin\u2019s lawyer applauded the March 7 verdict but expressed regret that Bernard Arnault had not been present amongst the defendants.\n\nMeanwhile, Squarcini is unlikely to hear a cell door clang behind him, as two years of the four-year term have been suspended and the ex-spy will serve the remaining two years in the comfort of his own home wearing an electronic tag.",

            "content": "The latest round of a high-stakes clash between Louis Vuitton and Van Cleef & Arpels over their respective jewelry collections brought a win for Louis Vuitton. In a decision on March 5, the French Court of Cassation\u2019s Commercial, Financial, and Economic Chamber ruled in favor of Louis Vuitton, rejecting an appeal filed by Van Cleef & Arpels owner Richemont International in a case alleging parasitic competition. The Court of Cassation\u2019s ruling affirms an earlier decision from the Paris Court of Appeal, which dismissed Richemont\u2019s claims that Louis Vuitton unfairly capitalized on Van Cleef & Arpels\u2019s iconic Alhambra motif by way of its Color Blossom jewelry collection.\n\nA Bit of Background: Richemont filed suit against Louis Vuitton back in 2017, claiming that the LVMH-owned brand has sought to \u201cfree ride\u201d on the reputation, investments, or creative efforts of Van Cleef & Arpels. Specifically, Richemont takes issue with the Color Blossom collection that Louis Vuitton introduced in 2015, which it claims bears striking similarities to Van Cleef & Arpels\u2019s almost-60-year-old Alhambra range.\n\nRichemont alleged that Louis Vuitton\u2019s infringing collection consists of a four-sided floral design set in a metal frame and semi-precious stones that mirror its Alhambra clover design (below, right). Beyond that, Louis Vuitton\u2019s Color Blossom (below, left) pricing structure resembles that of Alhambra, per Richemont, and its marketing strategy blurs the distinction between the two brands.\n\nAgainst this background, Richemont sought an order from the court to block Louis Vuitton\u2019s manufacture and sale of thirty-one different jewelry pieces; it also requested \u20ac15 million in damages and a public announcement on Louis Vuitton\u2019s website acknowledging the ruling.\n\nIn its defense, Louis Vuitton argued that it has long made use \u2013 and maintains trademark registrations for \u2013 its own clover design on jewelry, and that the design is inspired by its iconic toile monogram. At the same time, Louis Vuitton sought to chip away at the strength of Van Cleef & Arpels\u2019s rights in the coveted Alhambra design, maintaining that floral designs, including four-round-petal designs, are widely used by other jewelry companies and that such use is in line with prevailing market trends and common industry practices.\n\nA Big Win for Louis Vuitton\n\nIn its decision on March 5, as first reported by TFL, the Court of Cassation upheld the Paris Court of Appeals\u2019 June 2023 ruling, which rejected Richemont\u2019s claims of parasitic competition. Delving into the parties\u2019 respective claims, the Court of Cassation found that Richemont fell short in establishing parasitic intent on the part of Louis Vuitton. (Under French law, parasitism requires proof that an entity deliberately placed itself \u201cin the wake\u201d of a competitor to benefit from its reputation or investments. This means that a mere resemblance between products is insufficient \u2013 the plaintiff must demonstrate intentional and unfair exploitation by a competitor.)\n\nSpecifically, the court held that \u2026\n\n> No Exclusive Ownership of the Quatrefoil Motif: The four-sided floral design is not unique to Van Cleef & Arpels. The court highlighted that Louis Vuitton has used a similar motif in its Monogram canvas since 1896 and that the Color Blossom collection is a natural extension of Louis Vuitton\u2019s existing design language rather than an attempt to imitate Van Cleef & Arpels\u2019s Alhambra collection.\n\n> Design Differences: While both parties\u2019 collections feature floral motifs with semi-precious stones, Vuitton\u2019s Color Blossom collection includes distinct design modifications, according to the court.\n\n> Market Trends and Industry Practices Justify the Overlap: The court found that semi-precious stones set in precious metals were common in high-end jewelry. Many luxury houses have used similar floral motifs, thereby, reinforcing the notion that the Color Blossom design is part of a broader market trend rather than an attempt to copy Alhambra.\n\n> Lack of Intent to Exploit: The court found no evidence that Vuitton\u2019s collection is a strategic attempt to confuse consumers or piggyback on Van Cleef & Arpels\u2019s brand. Instead, it held that Vuitton has simply expanded its monogram flower motif into fine jewelry, a move consistent with its broader brand evolution.\n\nWith the foregoing in mind, the Court of Cassation rejected Richemont\u2019s appeal and upheld the Paris Court of Appeal\u2019s decision, dismissing the luxury goods giant\u2019s claims of parasitic competition against Louis Vuitton. In doing so, the court denied Richemont\u2019s request for a sales ban on 31 Louis Vuitton jewelry pieces and rejected its bid for \u20ac15 million in damages.\n\nA Few Takeaways: The court\u2019s decision is noteworthy in that it reaffirms the requirements for successfully claiming parasitism, namely, the burden on the filing-party to show intentional exploitation of its reputation by a competitor. Beyond that, the ruling also appears to limit the extent to which even very-well-known brands can claim exclusive rights over common design elements, with the court confirming that widely used motifs, such as quatrefoil clovers, cannot be monopolized. And still yet, the decision strengthens the protections that exist for brands around product expansion (akin to the zone of natural expansion in the U.S. to some extent), thereby, allowing that companies to expand upon existing designs without facing legal restrictions.\n\nThe case is Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Cartier v. Louis Vuitton Malletier, 05/03/25, n\u00b023-21.157 (Cass. Com.).",

His lawyers said he would appeal against the verdict.\n\nPart of Friday's verdict was related to the use of public resources to locate blackmailers targeting LVMH chairman and CEO in 2008, while Squarcini was still head of the country's security services.\n\n\n\nThat year, security agents staked out a cyber cafe in Aix-en-Provence to identify a suspect sending emails seeking to extort Arnault, as part of a mission Squarcini defended as protecting French economic interests.\n\n\n\nSquarcini was also found to be complicit in the illegal surveillance of Francois Ruffin, a French lawmaker who at the time was an activist, along with members of his left-wing publication Fakir. Ruffin and the members of Fakir were planning to disrupt an LVMH shareholder meeting in 2013 and preparing a satirical documentary film \" Patron\".\n\n\n\nThe film, which won the French Cesar award for best documentary in 2017, follows family members who lost their jobs at a supplier to LVMH.\n\n\n\nLVMH boss Bernard Arnault told judges in November that he did not know about the illegal surveillance he said was ordered nearly 10 years prior by a close associate who died in 2018.\n\nRuffin's lawyer, Benjamin Sarfati, welcomed Friday's verdict.\n\n\n\n\"We are satisfied with this decision that serves as a call to order, though we regret the absence of Mr Bernard Arnault among defendants,\" he said.\n\n\n\nLVMH, which reached an agreement in 2021 to pay a 10 million euro settlement to close a criminal probe into its role in the spying case with no admission of guilt, declined to comment.",

            "content": "PARIS Let\u2019s put this whole luxury downturn situation, of declining sales and revenue across the conglomerates LVMH and Kering, in terms we can all understand: Nobody wants this stuff! Yes, prices have gone way up, and economic anxiety looms, but if people want things, they figure it out. That\u2019s why Herm\u00e8s and the Row are minting moola. It\u2019s not just the ultra-0.1 percent who are buying those brands\u2019 scarves, handbags, coats and trousers. Their creative leads are cultivating and inspiring want.\n\nSo this season, the really good designers are thinking about desire \u2014 for clothes, for each other. \u201cEveryone [in the atelier] was saying \u2018female envy,\u2019\u201d said Daniel Roseberry, following his fabulous Schiaparelli show Thursday, moments after kissing a corseted Doechii hello. \u201cThat was the gauge in the fittings: Are we envious yet?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what makes Roseberry\u2019s clothes extraordinary: He writes rules for tackiness, for vulgarity. Okay, say his leather pants and skirts with a zillion layered macho belts, go ahead, show off. He sees a human instinct others dismiss as low and runs to serve it gracefully. Particularly gorgeous were a slinky gold evening suit, his bulbous sleeved jackets with fitted waists, and wild, hairy skirt suits. This is a very tender creative act, made especially so because his clothes are made impeccably.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother tender man is Rick Owens, whose best shows (like this one) are so persuasive in their mix of weirdness and expert cut that you can\u2019t wait to show off your body in his high-slit skirts (so high their panels almost look like trousers), no matter what your gams look like. \u201cThe juicy a-- was our erogenous zone this season,\u201d said Owens, reflecting upon a spiked panel that revealed the crest where the posterior meets the thigh. And it\u2019s not just one behind he has in mind: His clothes make everyone look (and feel) cool.\n\nThe relationship between the body, clothes and the mind is a central concern this season. Who are we dressing for? Who do our bodies really belong to? Pieter Mulier explored this dexterously at Ala\u00efa \u2014 perhaps the most irrationally desirable clothes on the market. On social media, many women pointed to the misogyny of Mulier\u2019s constricting clothes, and I remain skeptical about the designer\u2019s insistence that he wants to celebrate women when most of his pieces flatter only supermodel bodies. But his ropy jackets, hooded tops and tendriled knits make a certain kind of woman, the type who shops like a connoisseur or a collector of remarkable clothes, so ravenous that you can\u2019t ignore it. And since when are we projecting moral values onto our desires and fantasies? Don\u2019t kink-shame women\u2019s Mytheresa wish lists!\n\nThere was a row at the Row over the front row! The Olsen sisters, who design American label the Row, have become two of luxury\u2019s foremost philosophers. They think like extraordinary clients: What kind of trouser or dress can stand up to a vintage Chanel sheath, a Lisa Eisner necklace, an extreme design by Rei Kawakubo? Known to the internet hoi polloi for their viral shoes, they sent out all their models for Wednesday\u2019s show in thick, beautiful stockings without a shoe in sight. Once again, attendees were told not to take photos or videos. Punk.\n\nAnd rather than engage in the low art of assigned show seating, which is one of fashion\u2019s foremost exercises in status paranoia, they instead encouraged everyone to sit wherever, although there were only a handful of wooden seats and upholstered chairs and sofas. Of course, fashion people have no clue what to do when told they can do whatever they want. (Revealing.) People scrambled for the few available seats. Two gamine girls sat on a sofa with a Margaux \u2014 the label\u2019s hit bag, dubbed the new Birkin \u2014 to hold a spot for Anna Wintour. Then W Magazine editor Sara Moonves and the Cut editor Lindsay Peoples sauntered in and sat on the floor.\n\nSuddenly the floor became the locus of power and chic. A powerful editor offered another their seat on the sofa, thus consigning themselves to the floor in an act of graciousness that also gave them a more commanding perch. Oh, God, I found myself thinking. Why didn\u2019t I think of sitting on the floor?!\n\nAnd that\u2019s how really cool fashion works: Someone proposes something weird, a bit off \u2014 sometimes the very opposite of what everyone thinks is \u201ccorrect\u201d \u2014 and no one knows what to make of it until the right person just goes for it. In this season\u2019s collection, there were layers of knit dresses rolled at the shoulder, pin-neat blazers and knits worn in cozy, cheeky layers. One coat was belted by a small silver oyster shell, open at the center. Understated but totally erotic.\n\nA knee-high moment at Herm\u00e8s. + 67\n\nThe same feeling is found at Herm\u00e8s. In a horsey show of knit dresses that unzipped to reveal the hips and abs, buttery leather layers and wittily tied knits, designer Nad\u00e8ge Vanh\u00e9e showed all these social media freaks scratching their heads over rich women uniforms what looking good \u2014 relaxed, commanding, smart \u2014 really means. Vanh\u00e9e\u2019s clothes have a stunning mix of authority and whimsy, which makes them feel human, whereas many other big luxury labels (Dior, Chanel) make garments that feel mass and remote. Part of Herm\u00e8s\u2019s success while nearly every other brand is flopping must be that: She and her colleagues act like a small brand, a family brand, when, in fact, they\u2019re a behemoth.\n\nOne of fashion\u2019s other rare successes of the moment is Chlo\u00e9. \u201cThe Chlo\u00e9 woman is a real woman,\u201d said Chemena Kamali backstage \u2014 which is to say, ka-ching! Women are buying these clothes! Her bohemian dresses festooned with charms and little fur tails, along with her absolutely awesome coats, are so desirable, even if Sienna Miller circa 2008 is not the goddess you worship. (And there was Doechii, in one of the runway dresses, barefoot. Will the Rowdents spend this summer scurrying around the East and West villages without shoes?) Kamali\u2019s vintage-inspired looks aren\u2019t about nostalgia, but about freedom: They suggest a totally, almost decadently feminine space, where you wear a see-through blouse and no bra not to tantalize men but because you feel relaxed. Isn\u2019t feeling relaxed the rarest luxury you can imagine right now?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s note that the Row, Herm\u00e8s and Chlo\u00e9 are all helmed by women. The desire they elicit is not for attention, or even for sex \u2014 but for intimacy and companionship with other women. Yohji Yamamoto, perhaps fashion\u2019s greatest male flirt, showed a parable of that relationship at the close of his Friday show: Women in pairs wandered out in black coats, paused on the runway and turned the garments inside out to reveal bright purple lining, then traded coats and carefully adjusted each other\u2019s collars, lapels, hems.",

The trial shed light on efforts by LVMH \u2013 the world's biggest luxury group \u2013 to protect its reputation.\n\nBernard Squarcini, former head of France\u2019s internal intelligence agency, has been jailed and fined for misusing public funds.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nSquarcini, 69, headed France's domestic security services from 2008 to 2012 and was later hired by luxury giant LVMH as a security consultant.\n\nThe court on Friday handed him a four-year prison sentence, two of them suspended, on charges of using his security contacts for personal gain, including by obtaining confidential information for LVMH.\n\nSquarcini, whose professional nickname was \"le Squale\" (the shark), can serve his sentence at home with an electronic bracelet. He was also fined \u20ac200,000 and given a ban on professional activities relating to intelligence or advisory services for five years.\n\nHis lawyers said he would appeal the verdict.\n\nLinks to Europe's richest man\n\nPart of the verdict was related to the use of public funds to locate blackmailers targeting LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault in 2008, while Squarcini was still head of DCRI French security services (since renamed the DGSI).\n\nThat year, security agents staked out a cyber cafe in Aix-en-Provence to identify a suspect sending emails seeking to extort Arnault as part of a mission Squarcini defended as protecting French economic interests.\n\nArnault, Europe's richest man, testified during the trial in November as a witness but was never charged and denied all knowledge of a scheme to protect the luxury group.\n\nFrench luxury mogul Arnault defiant at ex-spy chief trial\n\n'A call to order'\n\nSquarcini was also found to be complicit in spying on Fran\u00e7ois Ruffin, a former journalist and founder of leftist magazine Fakir who is now a leading lawmaker with hard-left France Unbowed.\n\nRuffin filed a lawsuit in 2019 accusing LVMH of contracting Squarcini to spy on him for nearly three years while filming a satirical documentary \"Merci Patron\" (Thanks boss) for which the Fakir team planned to disrupt an LVMH shareholder meeting in 2013.\n\nThe film won a Cesar \u2013 France's equivalent of the Oscars \u2013 for best documentary in 2017.\n\nRuffin's lawyer, Benjamin Sarfati, welcomed Friday's verdict. \"We are satisfied with this decision that serves as a call to order, though we regret the absence of Mr Bernard Arnault among the defendants,\" he said.\n\nProceedings against LVMH were dropped in 2021 after the company paid a \u20ac10 million settlement to close the criminal probe.\n\nSquarcini, a close ally of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, was sacked as head of intelligence in 2012 after Sarkozy lost his re-election bid to Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.

He was also fined 200,000 euros ($217,300). His lawyer indicated that he plans to appeal the verdict.\n\nThe case centered around a scandal in which Squarcini and other individuals helped LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury goods company, protect its reputation through illegal means.\n\nOne of the most egregious acts involved a covert surveillance operation targeting French journalist Fran\u00e7ois Ruffin and his left-wing publication Fakir.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Ruffin had been working on a documentary called Merci Patron (Thanks Boss), which criticised LVMH\u2019s Billionaire CEO, Bernard Arnault, and the company\u2019s business practices. In response, LVMH sought to monitor Ruffin and his team to prevent their planned disruptions at an LVMH shareholder meeting in 2013.\n\nIn addition to Louis Vuitton and Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, LVMH's portfolio includes Christian Dior Couture, Givenchy, Fendi, Celine, Kenzo, Tiffany, Bulgari, Loewe, TAG Heuer, Marc Jacobs, Stella McCartney, Sephora and Loro Piana.\n\nSquarcini was found complicit in organising this surveillance, which included misappropriating state resources to track Ruffin and his colleagues.\n\nThe court ruled that Squarcini had abused his position to provide illegal services to LVMH, aiming to shield the company from negative publicity.\n\nHowever, LVMH itself was not among the defendants in this trial, though it had previously settled with a French court in 2021 by paying a \u20ac10 million fine to avoid criminal prosecution in connection with the case.\n\nThe trial drew attention to the actions of the luxury conglomerate and its efforts to quash criticism by targeting those seeking to expose its business practices.\n\nNotably, LVMH\u2019s CEO, Bernard Arnault, was called to testify in the trial, but he denied any knowledge of the illegal surveillance. Arnault defended his reputation as a business leader who had built LVMH into a global powerhouse.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Ruffin, who was one of the key figures in the case, welcomed the verdict, expressing satisfaction with the decision. He criticized the lack of accountability for LVMH itself, with his lawyer, Benjamin Sarfati, saying they regretted that Arnault was not a defendant.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Ruffin himself, in a post on social media, praised the conviction as a victory against corporate espionage and the abuse of power.\n\nLVMH declined to comment on the verdict, but its prior settlement in 2021 indicates a desire to close the case without admitting guilt.\n\nMeanwhile, Bernard Squarcini\u2019s legal team is preparing to appeal, and the public and media will likely continue to scrutinise the implications of the case for both corporate practices and the integrity of France\u2019s intelligence services.",

The Swedish sensation has rapidly become talk of the town with her innovative approach to upcycling deadstock. Harriet Quick takes a long look.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nImagine a giant cocooning \u2018bubble\u2019 coat made out of a myriad of fur hats \u2013 the type that a generation of ladies would once wear as Sunday best. Or perhaps a jacket with swinging sleeves constructed out of a series of men\u2019s tailored trousers? Perhaps, a defunct cello (sans strings) turned into an alternative evening dress? And what about a glam rock jacket and jeans combo made from glimmering gold zippers?\n\nThese were some of the marvels that Swedish born designer and LVMH Prize Winner 2024, Ellen Hodakova Larsson presented on the Paris runways this week to the sounds of thrash guitar music in a low-lit auditorium. As her tousled haired models paraded her absurdly beautiful designs entirely made from ingeniously upcycled deadstock, one is confronted with issues of consumption, built in obsolescence and waste.\n\nHodakova's designs are entirely made from upcycled deadstock David Siwicki\n\nDubbed the Greta Thunberg of fashion, this young woman who studied study fine art and sculpture at the Swedish School of Textiles, is offering up a solution to waste and attracting a legion of fans and supporters in her wake.\n\nDo you remember seeing Cate Blanchett in a Hodakova corset made of 200 antique silver spoons? Blackpink pop star Rose, Julia Fox and Kylie Jenner are also champions of her artful, witty work. \u201cWanting to understand communication and pose questions is just so deep rooted in me,\u201d says Larsson who is fully tuned in to the powerful medium of fashion.\n\nFollow the leader\n\nThe provocative message of the Hodakova brand is being keenly heard, with Larsson considered a cross generational inspiration for millions who are also on a mission to spend less, spend better and reinvent items be it furniture or clothing to suit changing needs and help protect the environment.\n\nEllen Hodakova Larsson has been dubbed the Greta Thunberg of fashion David Siwicki\n\nLarsson\u2019s own learnings and creativity were embedded as a young girl growing up on a farm in rural Sweden surrounded by fields. \u201cI grew up on horseback,\u201d she laughs noting how the discipline of equestrian life influenced her sense of commitment as well as her precise language of style.\n\nHer parents instilled the virtues and rewards of upcycling. Her seamstress mother rarely purchased anything new preferring to reinvent hand me downs and wardrobe staples and customise household deco. \u201cShe is a crafty woman. I was always up in the attic and trying out her 80s styles - the big dresses and big shoulder pads!\u201d smiles Larsson who alongside her brother enjoyed painting, making and craft.\n\nRising to the top\n\nLarsson\u2019s breakthrough happened on graduation in 2021 when Vogue Scandinavia named her a future talent to watch and her ascent into the limelight has been swift.\n\nShe set about launching her own brand which is now sold online and across a network of stores worldwide including Corso Como and Dover Street Market. \u201cI've always known that I wanted to be my own boss,\u201d says Larsson who dresses as she designs in reconstructed men\u2019s shirts and tailoring. She was a standout candidate for the LVMH Grand Prize Award 2024 (worth 400,000 euros and mentorship programme) and was chosen from a short list of 20 semi-finalists.\n\nLarsson, who works in Stockholm with a small team, is also tackling bigger issues of upcycled fashion which to date has involved time consuming handiwork that makes commercial success hard to achieve.\n\nThe designer and her team use AI tools to sort through their upcycled material David Siwicki\n\nThe team deploys AI tools to help sort and grade deadstock clothes (sourced via Swedish businesses and dealers) which expediates the selection process and analysis of possible usage. It means items can be produced at a modest scale. Online you can find asymmetric white shirts, camisole tops made from white bras and Hodakova\u2019s best-selling bags made from layered up belts and buckles.\n\nSweden\u2019s strong government backed sustainability initiatives also makes the country a supportive laboratory ground for future growth. But what drives Larsson is ultimately curiosity and the determination to find solutions \u2013 after all isn\u2019t that what design is about?\n\n\u201cIf I see a pair of trousers, what can I do with them?\u201d asks Larsson who is compelled to make something different and better. As revealed in her latest AW 25 collection, those trousers (belts included) can be a headdress, a swingy jacket, or upturned into an off the shoulder dress. Symbol and cipher of our topsy-turvy world, perhaps?",

            "content": "More Fashion Reviews From Cathy Horyn Right this way. Photo-Illustration: by The Cut; Photos: Courtesy of Givenchy\n\nGivenchy has had seven creative directors in the past 30 years. Sarah Burton, formerly with Alexander McQueen, is the latest. That must be a record turnover among Paris fashion houses, prompting the question: Is something wrong with the place? Some of the problem no doubt rests with LVMH, which acquired the business in 1989 from Count Hubert James Marcel Taffin de Givenchy, who founded it in 1952 and went on to be famous for his chic looks and as Audrey Hepburn\u2019s favorite dressmaker. But despite the talents of John Galliano, Lee Alexander McQueen and Riccardo Tisci \u2014 to name the best of Burton\u2019s predecessors \u2014 LVMH has always seemed to treat Givenchy as a poor relation of its richer and better-known properties, Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of what Hubert de Givenchy was known for, beyond Hepburn\u2019s movie clothes in the 1950s and \u201960s, and perhaps the romantic Bettina blouse, named for the model Bettina Graziani. With Dior, you have the New Look. Chanel is the cardigan suit and the Little Black Dress, to mention just two markers. Givenchy was known for tailoring, but that hardly sets it apart in this town.\n\nSo Burton, in a sense, is starting from scratch. When she was hired last summer, her boss, Sidney Toledano, who used to be chief executive of Dior and is today president of LVMH\u2019s fashion group, told her, \u201cGive me a silhouette.\u201d In other words, put down a clear line and build from there. What could be easier?\n\nOn Friday morning, debut day, I arrived at Givenchy\u2019s elegant building, at 3 Avenue Georges V, as a throng of onlookers was spilling into the street and cars were backed up in both directions. Because Burton is a recognized pro, who spent 27 years at McQueen \u2014 she began as a student intern in 1996 and became creative director after his death \u2014 and because this was an entirely new opportunity for her, the crowd seemed larger than usual, the anticipation greater. And Givenchy was showing in the house, not in a tent or a public building. There was room for only 300 people at each of the two showings on Friday.\n\nAt the entrance, I saw Toledano greeting guests and beaming, and he told me that Galliano, having seen the lights at No. 3 blazing the night before, had sent him a note of well wishes. Galliano had been invited to the show but was unable to attend. However, his partner, Alexis Roche, was there, and so was Daniel Roseberry of Schiaparelli. I passed Marisa Berenson. Burton\u2019s husband, David Burton, and their daughters and her mother were also seated in one of several white, high-ceilinged rooms, over two floors, being used for the show.\n\nIt is already early spring in Paris. Sunlight poured in. We were all seated on stacks of large brown paper envelopes, not unlike the kind couturiers and tailors used to store patterns. A few days earlier, Burton told me that two years ago workmen renovating a Givenchy office had literally found buried treasure in a wall \u2014 the patterns and notes from Givenchy\u2019s very first collection. How they got there nobody knows. From my symbolic paper perch in front of a window, I saw the actors Vanessa Kirby and Rooney Mara across the crowded room.\n\nAfter a brief bit of throat clearing, with a black mesh leotard stamped like a dressmaker\u2019s dummy with \u201cGivenchy Paris 1952\u201d and a pair of tubular mesh dresses with flounced viscose hems \u2014 meant to echo the skeleton of a couture look \u2014 Burton got down to business. Her tailoring was not only visually strong and perfect; it also was varied. There were coats and suit jackets with bold shoulders, and ones with neat shoulders. Sleeves also varied, from a kind of rounded couture sleeve, with an exposed flat-pressed seam spiraling from the armhole to the wrist, to sleeves that were mildly flattened and creased, for a sharper effect. Less visible on some of the tailoring \u2014 done in fabrics like mohair, a nice, heavy black cr\u00eape, a herringbone jacquard \u2014 were subtle raw edges, intended to keep things from looking too perfect.\n\nFrom left: Photo: Courtesy of Givenchy Photo: Courtesy of Givenchy From top: Photo: Courtesy of Givenchy Photo: Courtesy of Givenchy\n\nGenerally, Burton offered a cinched waist. One might say the lines owe something to McQueen, but that\u2019s not exactly accurate. Most designers who are constructionists, like McQueen and Balenciaga and Ala\u00efa and Givenchy, belong (more or less) to the same tailoring tradition, like members of a family tree. Burton belongs in that group. She said, \u201cThe masculine-feminine thing that I do is what I\u2019d like to establish at the house.\u201d\n\nFrom left: Photo: Courtesy of Givenchy Photo: Courtesy of Givenchy From top: Photo: Courtesy of Givenchy Photo: Courtesy of Givenchy\n\nMore than that, what came across in this thoroughly engaging show was confidence, the eye and experience of a pro. In the varied suit shapes (some of which had trousers with an elasticated bit at the back of the waist), in the wardrobe pieces, like her version of a crisp, oversize trench, and in her balance of sharp fit and comfort, she was giving women of diverse ages clothes that felt distinctive but also plainly real.\n\nFrom left: Photo: INDIGITAL.TV/INDIGITAL.TV Photo: INDIGITAL.TV/INDIGITAL.TV From top: Photo: INDIGITAL.TV/INDIGITAL.TV Photo: INDIGITAL.TV/INDIGITAL.TV\n\nAnd she consistently hit her mark of a Givenchy look in different ways. That was also impressive. There were minimalist halter dresses in white and pale-pink glove leather; a fantastic black leather bomber with a pair of metal zips running over a puffy shawl collar and worn with a matching, supersoft pencil skirt; and a black dinner suit in that heavy cr\u00eape with a short slit at the back of the neck and another at the hem.\n\nFrom left: Photo: Courtesy of Givenchy Photo: Courtesy of Givenchy From top: Photo: Courtesy of Givenchy Photo: Courtesy of Givenchy\n\n\u201cWith Givenchy, there was often a surprise at the back,\u201d Burton noted. Those gestures are also sexy and feminine and, because they\u2019re not overworked, they\u2019re hard to find in the market.\n\nFor her first big show, Burton offered a lot and at the same left herself places to go. Could there have been some dresses for the daylight hours? Sure. Could she have proposed some softer construction in her tailoring mix? Sure. I\u2019d love to see that from her. Could she have surprised us a lot more with her choice of models, which seemed pretty standard? Well, sure. At the age of 50, Burton had embarked on a completely new chapter of her career, in a different city, and she made me want to see more.\n\nAfter a standing ovation, as Charles Mingus\u2019s explosive \u201cHaitian Fight Song\u201d still filled the bones of the house, with Hubert de Givenchy dead in his grave, people made their way downstairs to congratulate Burton.\n\n\u201cSo how does it feel to have a Paris debut?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe roared. \u201cOh, fabulous! Every girl\u2019s dream, I think.\u201d",

The partnership, part of F1\u2019s $1 billion deal with LVMH, seems to be a step too far from having alcohol partners who usually promote their non-alcoholic drinks during the tournaments.Belvedere will also host an official after-party for the Australian Grand Prix , an \u201cexclusive event set to redefine high-end entertainment and nightlife,\u201d complete with world-renowned DJs. Moreover, Belvedere Vodka will be served in various hospitality spaces, such as the Paddock Club and the F1 Garage, at all events.Sharing his opinion on the same, Mark Mann-Bryans wrote in his column for Autosport.com, \u201cHaving an official vodka partner for the entire championship feels as though the lines have been blurred somewhat \u2013 especially with F1 racing in enough territories where alcohol, or its accompanying sponsorships, are banned.\u201d\u201cBut, given the great work it has done with the \u2018When You Drive, Never Drink\u2019 campaign in recent years, how does then lauding a partnership with Belvedere sit within that messaging?\u201d he further added.He feels the official vodka announcement \u201cdoes look slightly out of place\u201d as the F1 and Belvedere are positioning themselves as partners away from the traditional track-based brands and focusing on the experience building in and around the races themselves.While alcohol sponsorship isn\u2019t new to F1\u2014Heineken is the official beer of the series\u2014Mann-Bryans pointed out that past partnerships have been more restrained, such as Heineken promoting its alcohol-free brand alongside its anti-drink-driving campaign. Similarly, teams like McLaren and Ferrari have alcohol partners, but they too are promoting alcohol-free drinks.The growing focus on high-end entertainment and luxury sponsorships has shifted the narrative around F1, leaving some to question whether the sport is moving away from its racing roots in favor of nurturing an exclusive lifestyle brand.Also Read: How F1 teams actually make money?

According to industry sources, the Dutch designer\u2014renowned for his unconventional approach to fashion\u2014has already begun working with the Parisian house. Jean Paul Gaultier has not yet responded to requests for confirmation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuran Lantink - \u00a9Launchmetrics/spotlight\n\n\n\n\n\nSplitting his time between Amsterdam and Paris, the 37-year-old designer has experienced a meteoric rise over the past two years. After launching his label in 2019, Lantink saw his momentum stall due to the pandemic but made a strong comeback through major fashion competitions and runway debuts in Paris. He claimed the Special Prize from in 2023, the Prize at the Awards in 2024, and was a finalist for the 2025 International .\n\n\n\nLantink's signature lies in his masterful upcycling, transforming unsold garments and luxury house deadstock into striking, unexpected silhouettes. His ability to sculpt bold volumes using padding and precise cutouts has cemented his reputation as one of the most inventive designers of his generation.\n\nHis irreverent sense of humor and avant-garde approach draw clear parallels to Jean Paul Gaultier himself, whom Lantink has often cited as a creative influence. His blend of playfulness, sustainability, and deconstructed couture makes him a fitting choice to infuse the house with fresh energy.\n\n\n\nJean Paul Gaultier stepped away from the runway in 2020, closing a defining chapter of his career with his final haute couture collection. The designer had previously sold his brand to Catalan conglomerate in 2011 and discontinued ready-to-wear in 2015.\n\n\n\nSince then, the house has reintroduced ready-to-wear in 2021, revamped its e-commerce platform, and revived haute couture through a rotating series of guest designers. Among those who have reinterpreted Jean Paul Gaultier's iconic codes are Nicolas Di Felice, , , , and most recently, Ludovic de Saint Sernin\u2014who was also rumored to be in the running for the creative director role.\n\n\n\nWith this transition, Jean Paul Gaultier may now be preparing to conclude its series of guest collaborations, marking a significant new era for the house.",

Bernard Squarcini was also found guilty of partaking in unlawful surveillance of an Arnault critic while working as a security consultant for LVMH after he left the spy agency, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAt the trial, judge Benjamin Blanchet said Squarcini \u201cdeliberately chose to break the law for financial gain.\u201d The 69-year-old has been sentenced to a two-year jail term, which he can carry out outside of prison with an electronic bracelet. The Paris criminal court also fined the former head of the Direction Centrale du Renseignement Int\u00e9rieur a total of $706,300 (\u20ac651,500), according to the publication.\n\nAs for Arnault, neither he nor his company were charged in the case. LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE had previously settled with prosecutors back in 2021; as part of the agreement, the conglomerate had to pay about $10.9 million (\u20ac10 million) with no admission of guilt, Bloomberg reported.\n\nArnault denied know anything about an extortion stunt against him involving an alleged extramarital affair, saying in a November testimony that he only discovered the plot in the press years later, Bloomberg reported at the time.

The reported swindler, a paparazzo who was allegedly seeking about $325,000 (\u20ac300,000) for images of the supposed affair, was never found, Arnault said, and the photos were never published.\n\nDue to his position as head of France\u2019s domestic intelligence agency at the time, Squarcini claimed it was within his jurisdiction to investigate the 2008 blackmail attempt, he said at the trial. The security consultant will appeal the verdict, said one of his lawyers, Marie-Alix Canu-Bernard.\n\nSquarcini\u2019s unlawful surveillance conviction reportedly involved spying on the activities of Fran\u00e7ois Ruffin, a left-wing filmmaker.

Herm\u00e8s was a civil claimant in the case.\n\nIn December 2021, the Paris judicial court validated an agreement reached with LVMH that would see the luxury goods giant pay 10 million euros to settle claims that Squarcini spied for the company.

He also created the \u201cunpickable\u201d tumbler lock.\n\nPreviously, many locks were able to be cracked by burglars, but Vuitton and his son, Georges, created a single lock system with two spring buckles.

The deal will see the brand integrated into F1\u2019s hospitality spaces, including the Paddock Club, as well as hosting events such as an Official Afterparty at the Australian Grand Prix.\n\nFrancois-Xavier Desplancke, President and CEO of Belvedere Vodka, said: \u201cI am immensely proud of the partnership between Belvedere and Formula 1. Our mutual dedication to innovation, expertise, and precision naturally aligns our brands, creating a truly exceptional alliance.\u201d\n\nStefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1, added: \u201cFormula 1 has always been the symbol of prestige, adrenaline and spectacle, which is why we are so thrilled to welcome Belvedere as our first Official Vodka Partner.\u201d\n\nLVMH strengthens grip on Formula 1\n\nBelvedere\u2019s partnership follows LVMH\u2019s recent 10-year deal with Formula 1, which has already seen Mo\u00ebt & Chandon return as the sport\u2019s Official Champagne, replacing Ferrari Trento on the podium. The deal marks a major expansion of the luxury group\u2019s presence in F1, with other LVMH-owned brands\u2014including Hennessy and Louis Vuitton\u2014also integrated into various aspects of the sport.\n\nThe move comes at a time when LVMH is seeking to reinforce its dominance in the luxury drinks market amid declining sales. The group\u2019s wine and spirits division, Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, has been under pressure due to slowing demand, particularly in the US and China. Recent reports show that LVMH\u2019s drinks arm has continued to weigh on overall company performance, with revenue down 4% in 2023 and further declines reported into early 2024. This has prompted leadership changes within Mo\u00ebt Hennessy and a strategic shift to bolster high-end brand positioning.\n\nLVMH\u2019s wider challenges are not limited to alcohol. The luxury sector as a whole has been struggling, with reports indicating that the market lost around 50 million customers in 2023 due to economic uncertainty and shifting consumer priorities. By leveraging high-profile partnerships like Formula 1, LVMH appears to be doubling down on brand visibility and exclusive experiences to maintain its status in the ultra-premium sector.\n\nBelvedere\u2019s entry into Formula 1 continues the trend of high-end drinks brands associating with the sport, offering premium hospitality and entertainment experiences alongside the racing action. The return of Mo\u00ebt & Chandon to the podium and Belvedere\u2019s new role as the Official Vodka Partner reinforce Formula 1\u2019s positioning as a lifestyle spectacle as much as a motorsport championship.\n\nWith LVMH embedding itself further into F1, the sport is increasingly becoming a showcase for luxury brands\u2014both on and off the track.\n\nRelated news\n\nPharrell Williams debuts Champagne collaboration\n\nLVMH-owned Napa Valley producer closes\n\nAlexandre Arnault\u2019s two-year test to revive Mo\u00ebt Hennessy",

The label aims to redefine menswear for a new generation of luxury clients.\n\n\u201cWe live in a very interesting time in Saudi where in the past 30 years we\u2019ve been buying a lot, and I think now it\u2019s the time where we do fashion that is more culturally relevant to us,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to bring some of the fading traditions, such as men wearing skirts, for example.\u201d\n\nHis elegant monochrome pieces are often transformable. The top of a black coat can be detached to make a cropped jacket, while a white shirt features a button-off back. His skirts come in narrow or fuller styles, but not all customers are ready to adopt them.\n\n\u201cThe conversation is very interesting, because when we see the older generation and the younger generation, they love our work,\u201d he said. \u201cThe older generation, they relate to it, they\u2019ve seen it before, and the younger generation think it\u2019s cool and sexy and they want to experiment with it. Our generation is the generation that forgot its tradition, in a way.\u201d\n\nThe brand, sold exclusively at its studio in Riyadh, wants to expand into accessories. For Hassan, the LVMH Prize is an important step in that direction. \u201cRecognition is one thing, and it is the most important thing for us at this stage, and then also connecting with the right people to execute, to manufacture, to develop,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Afroluxurious\u2019 elegance\n\nDavid Boye-Doe, the founder of Ghanaian brand Boyedoe, said funding was crucial to scale up his genderless label, but he also saw the advice he could glean as crucial.\n\n\u201cWe want to produce in a more ethical way, so mentoring is one of the key areas,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout the correct mentorship and collaboration, you abuse the money.\u201d\n\nDavid Boye-Doe Stephane Feugere/WWD\n\nSome of his pieces, including a burgundy-colored coat with fringed trim, are made from fugu, a handwoven fabric originating from the northern parts of Ghana. It usually comes in vivid colors, but the label makes darker versions that it thinks are better suited for an international market.\n\n\u201cWe blend Afroluxurious heritage with ethical elegance,\u201d said Boye-Doe. \u201cIt\u2019s African luxury: our way of interpreting luxury.\u201d\n\nAlso among his designs were pants assembled from the waistbands of reclaimed jeans, and a coat pieced together from the leftover inseams. The designer usually sources items from Accra\u2019s sprawling Kantamanto market, Africa\u2019s largest secondhand clothing market, which burned down on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cNo matter the challenges, even losing our source of getting those things, we focus more on how we thrive,\u201d he said. \u201cEven to be here, to be selected as one of the first Ghanaian brands, is a testament of how we have thrived over the years.\u201d\n\nThe label, which has shown at Lagos Fashion Week and Portugal Fashion, is also present at the Tranoi trade show in Paris this season. Boye-Doe sees his role as clearing the way for other emerging African luxury brands.\n\n\u201cWe call ourselves the underdog, where people are not expecting that this thing is coming,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of us, other Africans, other Ghanaians can see that it can be done.\u201d\n\nRedefining American fashion\n\nEven in markets like the United States, designers are challenging established ways of making and selling men\u2019s clothes.\n\n\u201cMy business model is all bespoke custom orders,\u201d said Josh Tafoya. The Parsons graduate moved from New York to his native New Mexico during the pandemic and has since been exploring his family tradition of weaving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of Spanish influence, Mexicano influence and Genizaro,\u201d he explained, referring to the name given to detribalized Native Americans in the Southwest starting from the 17th century.\n\n\u201cMy family comes from a lineage of weavers, both sides, and I\u2019m trying to bring that culture back. It\u2019s slowly dying in New Mexico,\u201d added Tafoya, who had brought with him a nearly century-old piece woven by his grandmother.\n\nJosh Tafoya Stephane Feugere/WWD\n\nHis genderless pieces incorporate traditional elements like Mexican serape stripes, or Chimayo-inspired chevron motifs, but he imbues the designs with his own theatrical flair in a bid to challenge perceptions of Southwestern identity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll play into campy little motifs, like gunmetal for the Bandito bullet suits. And I\u2019ll play a lot with Western denims, but also with metallic fringes, because cowboy is a little flamboyant, it\u2019s funny,\u201d said Tafoya.\n\n\u201cWhen I went to Parsons, we were taught American fashion, and it was sportswear and the traditional brands,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s not my vision of American fashion. This is my vision. This is the oldest part of the Americas.\u201d\n\nAt a cocktail party on Wednesday, Maria Grazia Chiuri, creative director of womenswear at Dior, was among those who stopped at Tafoya\u2019s stand. Also making the rounds was Sarah Burton, who was preparing to show her debut collection for Givenchy on Friday and will be joining the LVMH Prize jury as a result.\n\nThe chic crowd also included Sidney Toledano, senior adviser to LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault; Tod\u2019s Group\u2019s chairman Diego Della Valle, who lingered at the Torish\u00e9ju booth; designer Gabriela Hearst; image architect Law Roach; milliner Stephen Jones, and models including Natalia Vodianova, Elle Macpherson, Toni Garrn and Paloma Elsesser.\n\nLVMH Prize ambassador Jaden Smith said he was \u201cblown away\u201d by the selection. \u201cEverybody here right now is at the forefront of fashion, innovation and design,\u201d he said.\n\nJaden Smith Dominique Maitre/WWD\n\nThe rapper and actor, who is known for his bold choices on the red carpet and has his own clothing line, Msftsrep, demurred when asked if he had any tips for the young talents. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019m here to learn things from everybody who\u2019s here,\u201d said Smith. \u201cI would love to study with them and learn things from them.\u201d\n\nFellow ambassador Lily James described the excitement of discovering the new voices shaping fashion.\n\n\u201cHearing about their stories, their identities, they\u2019re sharing their heritage, their cultures through their fashion and it\u2019s subverting something traditional and turning everything on its head \u2014 honestly I feel overwhelmed by the talent in this room, incredibly inspired,\u201d she said.\n\nJames advised the finalists to keep honoring what makes them \u201cunique, individual and authentic, because there\u2019s only one of you and that\u2019s your superpower.\u201d\n\nOvercoming Adversity\n\nMeanwhile, Delphine Arnault praised the resilience of the designers who have struck out on their own despite the challenging market conditions for independent brands.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of courage, a lot of passion, and they put themselves on the line,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the designers who are here could very well be working in the studios of large brands, so you have to have a very strong entrepreneurial side. Most of them have to do the work of 10 people on their own or with just one other person.\u201d\n\nDanial Aitouganov, for example, left his job as menswear designer at Louis Vuitton under Pharrell Williams last summer to focus on Zomer, the label he cofounded with stylist Imruh Asha.\n\nThe Dutch designer has eight years of experience working for brands including Vuitton, Chlo\u00e9 and Burberry, but admitted it was a challenge juggling design duties with everything else. \u201cWe are small, so I\u2019m learning as we go, and learning production and finances was really not on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d he said. \u201cI would love to have guidance in that.\u201d\n\nCynthia Merhej Stephane Feugere/WWD\n\nCynthia Merhej, the designer behind the Renaissance Renaissance label, has faced more challenges than most, steering her brand through the coronavirus pandemic, a huge explosion that destroyed swathes of Beirut, economic crisis and most recently, the conflict between the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy to say that now the company is finally back in Beirut. We\u2019ve been producing everything there for the last two years,\u201d said Merhej, who had briefly moved some operations overseas.\n\n\u201cA lot has now changed in terms of the landscape politically. We don\u2019t know for the worse or for the better, but what we know is now at least it\u2019s a bit more stable,\u201d she reported. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to run a business when every day you don\u2019t know if there will be a currency.\u201d\n\nHaving made the semifinals in 2021, when the event was held online due to the lingering effects of COVID-19, she was happy to attend the showroom in person.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously incredible to be nominated the first time, but to come back and actually have face-to-face contact, and for people to be able to physically touch the garments and to see them, it makes a huge difference,\u201d Merhej said. \u201cDuring COVID, it felt a bit isolated because we didn\u2019t actually get to meet each other. It didn\u2019t feel real because I didn\u2019t see the other people\u2019s collections. It\u2019s really nice to be back.\u201d",

She revealed she didn\u2019t expect sparks to fly between them in the song\u2019s second verse: 'Truth is, I wasn\u2019t tryna meet nobody / Baby, I was there to get my bag / But when I saw you I was like, \"I like that\" / Wasn\u2019t tryna break, baby, I fought back / But when I heard you say, \"Bonjour, b\u00e9b\u00e9\" / I was like, \"Damn.\"'\n\nFIND OUT MORE ON ELLE COLLECTIVE\n\nRead Next\n\nArnault, the 29-year-old CEO of LVMH Watches, might just fit the bill. After all, Lisa has been representing LVMH brands for years. In 2020, she was named Bulgari\u2019s ambassador. Interestingly, the first Instagram of Lisa\u2019s that Arnault liked is a shot of her promoting Bulgari.\n\nLisa hasn\u2019t confirmed or denied the Arnault dating rumours herself. When Billboard gave her a chance to and asked about the subject of 'Moonlit Floor (Kiss Me),' she quipped, 'Well, I didn\u2019t write that.'\n\n\n\nFan speculation about Lisa and Arnault\u2019s potential romance began in 2022. And on Valentine\u2019s Day 2025, Arnault was seen supporting Lisa at the premiere of The White Lotus in Thailand.\n\nHere\u2019s all we know about the French businessman and his history with Lisa.\n\nLisa and Arnault first sparked dating rumours in 2022.\n\nIn November 2022, Arnault shared a photo with Lisa and her fellow Blackpink members, Ros\u00e9, Jisoo, and Jennie. He revealed he attended their Los Angeles show. 'What an amazing evening for the BlackPink concert in LA. Congratulations and see you soon in Paris !!'\n\nFans noticed he started following Lisa that year and started hearting posts in early June 2022. To this day, he frequently likes her Instagrams.\n\nInstagram The first Instagram Arnault liked\n\nInstagram And the second one he liked\n\nLisa and Arnault have travelled the world together.\n\nFans have spotted hints of Lisa and Arnault\u2019s travels together since 2023, with one noticing the similarities in their social media posts when they were both in Italy.\n\nIn late January 2024, Lisa and Arnault were seen together in Paris. That year, the pair was also spotted in Hawaii, Japan, Miami, and Paris among other places.\n\nThey posed together at the TAG Heuer Formula 1 Kith launch in Miami on May 3, 2024:\n\nJohn Parra // Getty Images\n\nArnault supported Lisa at Coachella 2023 and at the 2024 Global Citizen Festival.\n\n\n\nArnault has been very supportive of Lisa\u2019s work for years. He was seen watching Lisa perform at Coachella in April 2023. The two also posed together at Blackpink\u2019s after-party.\n\n\n\nIn September 2024, Lisa debuted 'Moonlit Floor (Kiss Me),' the Alter Ego track believed to be about Arnault, onstage at the Global Citizen Festival. He was in New York City with her, with the rumoured couple being photographed eating together before her performance.\n\nArnault attended the Thailand premiere of The White Lotus on Valentine\u2018s Day.\n\nArnault went to great lengths to support Lisa \u2014 and on Valentine\u2019s Day, no less. The CEO was filmed arriving at the Bangkok, Thailand premiere of The White Lotus season 3 on Feb. 14, 2025. Lisa posed by herself on the red carpet.\n\nBilly H.C. Kwok // Getty Images\n\nArnault is the son of billionaire Bernard Arnault, who is the CEO of LVMH.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric is one of Bernard Arnault\u2019s five children. His father has a net worth of $187.6 billion (\u00a3157 billion), according to Forbes.\n\nArnault attended \u00c9cole Polytechnique and previously worked at Facebook.\n\nArnault\u2019s career didn\u2019t just start at TAG Heuer. The entrepreneur has a business background, having graduated from France\u2019s \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 2014 with a degree in computational and applied mathematics.\n\nHe worked at Facebook and McKinsey prior to joining TAG Heuer in 2017.\n\nArnault became the CEO of TAG Heuer in 2020.\n\nHe spoke to Arabian Watches & Jewellery magazine about why he chose to join TAG Heuer of all the LVMH brands. He began working at the watch company in 2017 under Stephane Bianchi.\n\n'TAG Heuer was my first watch, it\u2019s a brand I have always been close to,' he said. 'I love the product and world of sports as well. It is also a project that symbolises the energy of my own self. TAG Heuer is the key to innovation that can be achieved in the brand. When I first saw the watch I told myself this is something to be developed further and I joined the brand through this business unit. Then I fell in even more love with the watches, and I have the will to invest time and energy for the brand. I\u2019m the CEO for one and half year but I\u2019m with the brand for almost three years before I became the CEO.'\n\nArnault and Lisa were seen together at a Bulgari event. He later shut down rumours he was going to take over the brand.\n\nOn May 16, 2023, Bulgari ambassador Lisa attended the Bulgari Mediterranea High Jewellery event in Venice. Arnault was throughout the night.\n\nClaudio Lavenia // Getty Images\n\nIn July 2023, he shut down rumours he was moving to Bulgari in an interview with Bloomberg. He hinted that his future will include work at other LVMH brands. 'For now I\u2019m staying at TAG Heuer,' he stated. 'I will eventually grow in other brands in the group, probably other categories as well, which I\u2019m also very interested in. But for the time being, I\u2019m staying at TAG Heuer, and there\u2019s still many amazing projects, too: to work on the big watches, big new boutiques and some key projects that I want to see and bring to the market.'\n\nHe acknowledged his presence with Lisa at the Bulgari event sparking the chatter: 'You know where it came from? Because I went to Bulgari event in Venice and from there all the rumours came. I always go to fashion shows! For five years now. There you go. Why can\u2019t I go to a high jewelry event, which is like the event of the year for Bulgari?'\n\nHe was appointed the CEO of LVMH Watches in 2024.\n\nArnault got a promotion, with LVMH announcing he would be overseeing Hublot, TAG Heuer, and Zenith on Jan. 1, 2024. Arnault reports to St\u00e9phane Bianchi, CEO of LVMH Watches & Jewellery Division.\n\nArnault is a Scorpio.\n\nArnault was born on Nov. 7, 1995. In 2023, Lisa further fuelled dating rumours between them when she was seen in Paris during his birthday.\n\nLisa herself is an Aries, born on March 27, 1997.\n\nThe Astro Twins wrote in ELLE US that the two signs have a 'fierce physical attraction' to each other. 'Put your considerable talents together with Aries running the table and Scorpio handling the back of the room, and you can tap into a rich vein of wealth and thrive as a power duo,' they shared.\n\nWhile Arnault regularly likes Lisa\u2019s Instagrams, he keeps his own social media business-oriented.\n\nArnault is able to keep his private life private. Most of his Instagram posts are focussed on events for his LVMH watch brands. His interviews are also just focused on his work. In July 2022, Revolution Watch described Arnault as 'relatively self-effacing and understated... [He] prefers to let his actions and products speak for him.'\n\nHowever, a Lisa/Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric fan account (yes, they exist) caught him watching one of its Instagram stories once, so at the very least, it\u2019s no secret he\u2019s a big Lisa fan.\n\nELLE Collective is a new community of fashion, beauty and culture lovers.

            "content": "Collections: Womenswear and genderless\n\nCan you tell us a bit about yourself and your brand in a few words?\n\nBenjamin: All-In started as a magazine in 2015 and we made our first collection in 2018, just for a photo shoot. We showed it to some friends including Maryam Nassir Zadeh, who decided to sell it in her store. We did our first runway show in the store in 2019. We were encouraged by the response to these small collections of one-of-a-kind, upcycled pieces so we decided to continue. We presented a collection of one-of-a-kind pieces in Paris for the first time in 2021. That was the first time we met people that said we should produce it. So we did. We design everything working with existing garments that we deconstruct and reconstruct, but now we also use this design method to produce things that are scalable.\n\nWhat do you think the biggest challenges facing emerging designers are today?\n\nBror: There are so many. But an overarching thing that is difficult is that you have to put on so many different hats. One day you\u2019re a designer, a merchandiser, a salesperson, your own PR; you kind of have to know how to do everything, often things that you don\u2019t have experience with so you have to learn on the go. As you grow, those things also get more serious and real and kind of harder to handle without expertise. But it\u2019s very nice for us that we are two people, so we are able to lean on each other.\n\nWhat does the LVMH Prize mean to you?\n\nBenjamin: All-In started by looking at fashion from the outside. Maybe things have changed slightly more recently. But for a long time, we felt like it was a bit of an outsider brand to the industry. And we kept some distance, too. So it\u2019s been very exciting to be recognised in this way by the industry. It\u2019s such a benchmark. The weirdest thing is that some of the people you admire most are actually going to look at what you make.\n\nWhat will you do with the prize if you win?\n\nBenjamin: We\u2019ve talked about investing in infrastructure to support the production and development of [upcycling] more vintage clothing. That was the basis of the brand in the beginning. But I think as we\u2019ve grown, it\u2019s been challenging in some ways to also scale that portion of the business. It\u2019s very time consuming. So that\u2019s the first thing we\u2019d invest in.\n\nBoyedoe by David Boye-Doe Kusi, Ghana",

From fiery landscapes to glacial blue icebergs, Robert Wilson\u2019s visual dramaturgy symbolized a world of metamorphosis, channeling the character of Orlando. At the heart of the collection is the white shirt, conversing with forms conceived by Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9, \u201cthe architect of fashion\u201d and creative director of Dior from 1989 to 1996. This founding element frees the outfit from gender stereotypes as Maria Grazia Chiuri emphasizes a certain fluidity. The concept is reprised in frilly removable collars, an evolution of the Orlando ruff and an accessory that transcends eras against the backdrop of a musical leitmotif, \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u201d. These temporal interplays are embodied in iterations of the J\u2019adore Dior t-shirt signed John Galliano, creative head of Dior from 1996 to 2011, revisited with floral embroidery.\n\n\n\nFrom backstage to runway, from dark to light, the collection is dominated by black and white. Subtle transparency is heightened in hyper-structured coats. Masculine jackets are combined with bustiers and the tailcoat is back, creating elongated silhouettes, while crinolines highlight the waist. Velvet and shiny effects dialogue with leather and shearling. Lace flows into twirling ribbons. Raincoats morph into capes for the final act amidst a cloud of smoke, blurring the borders between fiction and reality for the space of an enthralling show.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "The charm of classical arts has always been a fundamental part of the vision of Italian designer Francesco Murano, since the conception of his namesake brand in 2021. This was translated into a reflection on purity of absolute shapes such as the circle, a representation of beauty perfection. Murano was also interested in harmony between opposites, studying movement and its interaction with the body. Friedrich Nietzsche's idea of rationality, Apollonian, and the irrational passion, defined as Dionysian, have always been a sort of philosophical guide for Murano; his way of conceiving fashion.\n\nDuring Milan Fashion Week, the designer held his first show, in the cozy Fondazione Sozzani, presenting his fall 2025 collection, called Aequus Libra. These two latin terms are the roots of the word equilibrium, one of Murano\u2019s starting points this new season. He focussed on the proportions of different parts of the garments, because sometimes\u2014as he put it, showing the collection in his studio a few days ahead of the show\u2014the perfect balance is obtained by giving the right weight to single components. Thus asymmetry became a tool to express harmony, where, for example, a single sleeve re-proportioned the whole silhouette.\n\nThe young designer combined volumes almost like a sculptor. Therefore his moulage technique\u2014which consists of draping fabric directly on the mannequin\u2014was used to create soft movement through dresses and tops with straight central necklines. They made a strong contrast with sartorial pieces such as extremely fitted jackets, in wool or leather, and pants.\n\nFor the draped pieces, the variety of jerseys chosen\u2014light, shiny or in a transparent chiffon effect\u2014let Murano explore sophistication through monochrome looks in full black, white, mahogany, and lead gray. Thus, the long leather coats created contrasts with the sheer shirts, while the suits were sculptural and relaxed at the same time.",

On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 12% generated by the Luxury industry.\n\nIn the above chart we have measured LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can for free.\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nThe trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 17% and the business has deployed 56% more capital into its operations. 17% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe main thing to remember is that LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return.

            "content": "Bernard Arnault\u2019s Children: Who They Are and Their Role in LVMH\n\nBernard Arnault, the billionaire behind luxury goods empire LVMH, has built a family dynasty. His five children\u2014Delphine, Antoine, Alexandre, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, and Jean\u2014are all involved in the business, leading to speculation about who might inherit control of the company. But despite their deep involvement, Arnault insists that leadership is not guaranteed to any of them.\n\nHere\u2019s everything to know about Bernard Arnault\u2019s children, their careers, and whether one of them will eventually take over LVMH.\n\nDelphine Arnault: The Eldest and CEO of Christian Dior\n\nBorn in 1975, Delphine Arnault is the eldest child and the most senior of her siblings in the LVMH hierarchy. She studied at EDHEC Business School and the London School of Economics before joining LVMH in 2000. After rising through the ranks at John Galliano and Dior, she spent a decade at Louis Vuitton before being appointed CEO of Christian Dior in 2023.\n\nDespite being a top contender for succession, Delphine has said she focuses on her work rather than family dynamics. She has two children and is in a relationship with tech billionaire Xavier Niel.\n\nRelated: How Bernard Arnault's Grueling Daily Routine Shapes His Success\n\nRelated: Bernard Arnault: The Rise of the World\u2019s Luxury Empire Builder\n\nAntoine Arnault: The Public Face of LVMH\n\nBorn in 1977, Antoine Arnault plays a key role in LVMH\u2019s public image. He joined the company in 2005, worked his way up at Louis Vuitton, and currently serves as CEO of Christian Dior SE and chairman of Loro Piana.\n\nAntoine is married to supermodel Natalia Vodianova, and together they have two children. He has dismissed comparisons of the Arnault family to the fictional power struggles of HBO\u2019s Succession, insisting that the siblings get along well.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: The Innovator at Tiffany & Co.\n\nBorn in 1992, Alexandre Arnault is known for bringing a modern touch to the LVMH portfolio. He spearheaded LVMH\u2019s acquisition of Rimowa in 2016, becoming its CEO at just 24. In 2021, he moved to Tiffany & Co. as executive vice president of product and communications, overseeing the brand\u2019s transformation.\n\nMarried to accessories designer G\u00e9raldine Guyot, Alexandre recently became a father and was appointed to LVMH\u2019s board in 2024, solidifying his influence within the company.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault: Leading TAG Heuer\n\nBorn in 1995, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault runs Swiss watch brand TAG Heuer as its CEO. With degrees in mathematics and computer science, he has pushed the brand into smartwatches and innovation.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and his brother Alexandre were appointed to the LVMH board in 2024, further increasing their presence in the company\u2019s leadership. He has also been linked to BLACKPINK\u2019s Lisa, sparking public curiosity about his personal life.\n\nRelated: CEO Today Top 50 - Bernard Arnault\n\nJean Arnault: The Youngest and Rising Star\n\nBorn in 1998, Jean Arnault is the least experienced but is quickly rising within LVMH. After earning degrees from Imperial College London and MIT, he joined Louis Vuitton in 2021 as director of watches. He has expressed a deep passion for horology and is expected to take on more responsibilities in the future.\n\nJean is in a relationship with Zita d'Hauteville, a partner manager at YouTube and descendant of Parisian nobility.\n\nWho Will Inherit LVMH?\n\nDespite all five children holding key positions, Bernard Arnault insists that inheritance is not automatic. He has said that the best person\u2014inside or outside the family\u2014should take over. However, he continues to involve his children closely, bringing them together for monthly business meetings.\n\nWith multiple heirs, the future of LVMH remains uncertain. Will one of the Arnault siblings take control, or will leadership pass to an outsider? Only time will tell.",

            "content": "Net profit jumped 25 percent to 839 million euros ($884 million), in results closely watched amid speculation about Prada's forthcoming acquisition of Italian label Versace.\n\nUS parent company Capri Holdings has put Versace up for sale and entered exclusive negotiations with Prada at the end of February.\n\nPrada has already set the price at nearly 1.5 billion euros and could finalise the agreement before the end of the month, according to the Bloomberg news agency.\n\nAsked about these rumours on Thursday after a show during Milan Fashion Week, designer Miuccia Prada simply said: \"Versace is on everyone's table.\"\n\nA merger between the two legendary brands would create a luxury hub with a turnover of more than six billion euros that could increase Italy's weight in a sector dominated by giants such as French groups LVMH and Kering.\n\nSuch an agreement would also go against the trend of recent years that has seen big names in Italian fashion like Gucci, Fendi and Bottega Veneta pass into the hands of French competitors.\n\nChallenging environment\n\nThe slowdown in luxury goods consumption worldwide, particularly in China, is affecting almost all of Prada's competitors, which have recorded falls in sales and profits.\n\nBut unlike LVMH and Kering, Prada is in rude health.\n\nThe 2024 net profit was more than the 820 million forecast in the Factset Estimates survey, thanks to double-digit growth in sales in Asia and Europe.\n\nTurnover of the Hong Kong-listed company rose to 5.4 billion euros in 2024, up 15 percent on current exchange rates.\n\n\"We are pleased to see that our strategy continued to deliver above-market performance, notwithstanding the challenging environment,\" said Prada group chairman and executive director Patrizio Bertelli.\n\nThe brand has experienced \"solid growth\" with a four-percent increase in its retail sales at constant exchange rates over 2024 and also in the fourth quarter, the group said.\n\nSales of sister brand Miu Miu, which targets a younger clientele, have exploded, soaring 93 percent in 2024 and 84 percent in the fourth quarter.\n\nSo how is Prada thriving when its rivals are not?\n\n\"Consumer tastes have moved from maximalism to minimalism. This fits well with the nature of Prada,\" Luca Solca, an analyst at research group Bernstein, told AFP.\n\nRestoring lustre\n\nBy buying and relaunching Versace, Prada could further expand its empire, which also includes the shoe brands Car Shoe and Church's.\n\nFounded in 1978 by designer Gianni Versace and his brother Santo, Versace is an icon of Italian fashion, known for its luxurious and sensual style.\n\nAfter Gianni was murdered in 1997, his sister and confidante Donatella took over the creative direction of the brand.\n\nBut she lacked self-confidence and the label gradually fell apart.\n\n\"It's hard to go from assistant to creative director. But when she started digging into Gianni's archives, she managed to restore Versace's luster,\" Antonio Bandini Conti, a consultant designer, told AFP.\n\nVersace got back on track by appointing a new chief executive in 2009, Gian Giacomo Ferraris, and the brand diversified, opening hotels, selling watches and perfume.\n\nCapri Holdings bought the fashion house in 2018 for 1.83 billion euros. It had until then been majority-owned by the family, although US fund BlackRock had 20 percent.\n\nSince the takeover, however, Versace has lost some of its shine again.\n\n\"The Versace brand has become too commercial. Prada will be able to allow it to return to its golden age and reconnect with its luxury DNA,\" said Bandini Conti.\n\nIts sales have suffered, falling by 15 percent to 193 million dollars in the third quarter of its staggered 2025 financial year which ran to the end of December.\n\n\u00a9 2025 AFP",

Some critics questioned why she was invited to perform when nominees for Best Original Song were not. Others speculated that her inclusion was linked to her boyfriend, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, the CEO of LVMH Watches, whose company sponsors the Academy Awards. Lisa, who has partnerships with luxury brands under LVMH, has not commented on the claims.\n\nDespite the controversy, Lisa\u2019s Oscars performance marked a milestone for K-pop\u2019s global influence, and she received widespread praise for her stage presence.

Prominent figures including Natalia Vodianova, Farida Khelfa, Imaan Hammam, Charles Rosier, Gaia Repossi, Giambattista Valli, and numerous more have taken notice of her works that connect fashion with modern art, embodying a sophisticated concept of luxury through a careful interplay of texture and structure. Yasmin is establishing herself as a designer to watch with her recent Fashion Trust Arabia win and her inclusion in the LVMH Prize 2025 semi-finalists.\n\nYou draw upon architecture and great designers of the past like Elsa Schiaparelli and YSL in your work. Additionally, you divide your atelier and life between Paris and Doha, what drew you to the two cities, and do you find any similarities between the two cities?\n\nParis and Doha each play a unique yet complementary role in my creative process. Paris is where ideas take shape. It\u2019s a city steeped in history, craftsmanship, and artistic dialogue. Being surrounded by its rich fashion heritage and architectural grandeur constantly fuels my vision. Doha, on the other hand, is home, it\u2019s where my roots are, where I first fell in love with design, and where my atelier brings concepts to life with meticulous craftsmanship.\n\nThough they may seem worlds apart, both cities share a deep appreciation for culture, innovation, and storytelling. Paris has an undeniable legacy of haute couture, while Doha is rapidly emerging as a hub for creativity and modern luxury. That balance between tradition and reinvention mirrors my approach to design blending historical influences with a forward-thinking perspective.\n\nWhat inspirations do you get from Doha and do you see it playing a future influential role in fashion?\n\nDoha is a city of contrasts, where the past and future coexist in a way that feels effortless. The architecture, the desert landscape, and the cultural heritage all inspire me. There\u2019s a raw beauty in the way the city is constantly evolving while staying deeply connected to its roots. That duality, tradition, and modernity resonate with my approach to design, where I blend structured, architectural forms with fluidity and movement.\n\nAs for its role in fashion, I truly believe Doha is on the rise. The region is embracing craftsmanship, innovation, and sustainable luxury in a way that\u2019s shaping new conversations in the industry. With platforms like Fashion Trust Arabia and an increasing global interest in Middle Eastern designers, Doha has the potential to become a key player in the future of fashion, not just as a market but as a creative force.\n\nYour latest collaboration was with Qatar-based artist Al Muftah, can you tell us a bit about it?\n\nCollaborating with Al Muftah was a deeply inspiring experience. Their work captures the essence of Qatari heritage while pushing creative boundaries, which aligns closely with my own design philosophy. Our collaboration was about merging two disciplines; fashion and fine art to create something that felt both contemporary and rooted in tradition.\n\nThe collection we developed was a dialogue between texture, form, and storytelling. I incorporated their artistic vision into fabric manipulation techniques, ensuring that every piece carried a sense of depth and meaning. It wasn\u2019t just about aesthetics; it was about honoring craftsmanship and cultural identity in a way that felt fresh and forward-thinking.\n\nYou also work with many Middle Eastern clients. How has the fashion industry and aesthetic changed there over the past few years?\n\nThe fashion industry in the Middle East has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past few years. There\u2019s been a shift towards a more individualistic approach to style. Women are embracing bold, avant-garde designs while still honoring tradition. There\u2019s also a growing appreciation for craftsmanship and sustainability, with many clients seeking out unique, well-crafted pieces over mass-produced luxury.\n\nSocial media and global fashion events have played a role in this evolution, but what\u2019s truly exciting is the emergence of regional talent. Middle Eastern designers are redefining the industry on their terms, blending heritage with modernity. Clients are more experimental now, unafraid to mix global influences with their cultural identity, and that\u2019s shaping a new era for fashion in the region.\n\nWould you ever want to design for a big Paris house?\n\nDespite the appeal of the prestigious Paris houses, my current focus is firmly on developing my own brand and the vision I\u2019ve cultivated over the years. That said, my time as an intern for Balmain in Paris left a lasting impression on me. It was an invaluable experience that shaped my understanding of haute couture, craftsmanship, and the timeless allure of Parisian fashion. While my brand is where I\u2019m pouring my energy now, the lessons I learned in Paris will always remain an essential part of my journey. Designing for a Paris house is an intriguing thought, but right now maintaining the soul of my own label is where my heart lies.\n\nSustainability including upcycled materials and ethical craftsmanship, are part of your label\u2019s DNA. What challenges do you face and what solutions have you found?\n\nSustainability is at the core of my design ethos, and while it brings its share of challenges, it also drives innovation in every collection. One major challenge is sourcing materials that not only meet our strict aesthetic standards but also adhere to ethical and sustainable practices. The process of ensuring every piece is crafted with care, minimizing waste, and upholding fair labor practices requires constant vigilance and creativity.\n\nDuring the pandemic, I discovered the untapped potential in discarded materials. This led to the development of a unique layering technique that transforms what might be considered waste into dynamic, textured elements in my designs. This approach not only reinforces our commitment to upcycling but also adds a storytelling element to each piece. By building strong, transparent relationships with my suppliers and artisans, I\u2019ve been able to turn these challenges into opportunities, proving that ethical craftsmanship and luxury can indeed go hand in hand.\n\nWhat is the most exciting textile you have worked with?\n\nI\u2019m always intrigued by the potential that each textile holds. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with a diverse range of materials, and rather than singling out one as the most exciting, I find that every fabric brings its own story. One project that stands out is my work with upcycled materials during the pandemic. I transformed what many would consider waste into dynamic, layered textures, a process that not only pushed creative boundaries but also reinforced my commitment to sustainable design. This experimentation opened up new avenues for exploring texture and movement, proving that innovation can emerge from the most unexpected sources.\n\nIf I stepped into your atelier, what would I find and what music would be on your playlist?\n\nIf you step into my atelier, you\u2019ll be greeted by a harmonious blend of creativity and organization, a space where every sketch, fabric swatch, and material tells its own story. The environment is both vibrant and serene, with natural light spilling over carefully curated displays of design elements. To complement this creative sanctuary, the air is filled with chill, soulful tunes, think smooth, timeless melodies reminiscent of Sade setting a relaxed, inspiring backdrop for the work that unfolds here. Of course, some nights, we also play some Arab bangers. How could we not?\n\nWhat is your vision of luxury today?\n\nMy vision of luxury is about transcending the superficial, it\u2019s an immersive experience of authenticity and art. True luxury is found in the harmony between heritage craftsmanship and forward-thinking innovation. It\u2019s about the care that goes into every detail, from ethically sourced materials to the stories woven into each design. In today\u2019s world, luxury is redefined by sustainability and a commitment to timeless beauty that doesn\u2019t compromise ethics or creativity.\n\nAnd finally, what mark would you like to leave in the industry?\n\nI want to leave a legacy that transcends beautiful designs, one that empowers Arab girls and women to take the lead in the world of art. I envision an industry where every aspiring designer feels encouraged to break barriers and tell her own story. Drawing inspiration from trailblazers like Her Excellency Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, whose leadership and vision continue to redefine modern Arab elegance, I hope to foster a creative space where innovation and cultural heritage coalesce. Ultimately, I aim to create opportunities that inspire young talents to pursue their dreams and transform the fashion landscape into a realm of inclusivity, authenticity, and endless possibility.\n\nFollow @yasminmansourofficial",

And according to Silvia Venturini Fendi, the designer behind the centenary collection and the lone remaining family member involved in the business (now owned by LVMH), when she began thinking about what that might look like, she thought of her first Fendi memory. Which happened to be of herself in 1966, age 6, walking in her first Fendi show and wearing a child-size fur equestrian jacket designed by Karl Lagerfeld. She had the photo on her mood board backstage.\n\nSo no surprise that what turned out to be a lovely Fendi show opened first with Ms. Venturini\u2019s 6-year-old twin grandchildren wearing new versions of that jacket, and then with what appeared to be a voluptuous fox fur (or rather a fox-like shearling, since that is what most of the fur really was), belted at the waist. Or that it was followed by more furs, among the graceful beaded 1920s frocks and strong-shouldered suits that fell stylistically somewhere between the \u201940s and \u201980s, including intarsia furs.

Chesnot/Getty\n\nAs the son of a French billionaire, Arnault isn't necessarily a stranger to the public eye.\n\nHis father, Bernard Arnault, is the head of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH and is one of the wealthiest people in the world with a net worth of over $180 billion, per Forbes.\n\nBernard co-founded the company in the 1980s. Since then, it has become a family business, with all five of his children, including Arnault, holding various positions.\n\nHe is the CEO of a watch company\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault speaks onstage during the launch of The New Connected Watch by TAG Heuer on March 12, 2020, in New York City.

Growing up we talked about studies a lot, sport, music, politics, but business was still the main topic of discussion.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn January 2024, he stepped into the role of CEO of LVMH Watches & Jewelry.\n\nHe is a pianist \u2014 and once played with the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault attends the premiere of Netflix's 'The Gray Man' on July 13, 2022, in Hollywood, Calif.

            "content": "LVMH Prize finalists Benjamin Barron and Bror August Vestb\u00f8 of All-In are leaning into multitasking. Having recently published a folio of backstage looks from their spring Uptown Girl show (which referenced the 1988 movie), the duo moved into a new light-filled work space, which is where the designers (who show once a year) did a walkthrough of their first ever fall collection. Conceived as a sequel to last season, it was titled Downtown Girl with a melancholy feeling of autumn. Accordingly, the colors were more muted, but an All-In collection without a dash of bubblegum pink is unimaginable, and the lookbook opens and closes with it. The final look was a delicious \u201980s-inspired confection with ruffles, insets of lace and a lavish pussy-cat bow paired with fierce studded black-leather thigh-high boots. This was but one variant of the Level style with which the brand has cornered the cool-girl shoe market.\n\nIn contrast to the OTT closer, the opening look, a single pullover that presented as three, showed how All-In\u2019s approach to design can be translated into approachable pieces without feeling watered down. The more daring consumer might go for the brand\u2019s first outerwear design, a triple parka in army green with fur trim. More familiar were the twisted, upcycled T-shirt tops suspended from a strand of gum-ball-sized pearls. Here, fall\u2019s popular peplum took the form of a tulle-lined mini layered over pants. The corpcore trend was worked through button-down shirts and sweaters with shoulder pads Tess McGill would have loved.\n\nWhat stood out, in all ways, were the brand\u2019s signature \u201cdisplay\u201d pieces, a skirt that looked like it was wearing a skirt, and most dramatically (look four) a triple shirt that seemed to be magnetically attached to the front of the model\u2019s body. This is not something that Barron and Vestb\u00f8 created (designers including Olivier Theyskens and Jean Paul Gaultier have used the technique) but they convincingly made it their own, not through the camp aspect of their practice, but through their deep understanding of, and appreciation for, the way people construct a look, and by extension a self.\n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting is that these \u201cdisplay\u201d pieces, with their layers, are a sort of visual representation of the brand\u2019s multimedia practice. Barron had started All-In as a magazine in 2015, before he met Vestb\u00f8. In 2019 they extended their storytelling to fashion and accessories via a collaboration with Maryam Nassir Zadeh, who put versions of their upcycled fantasy shoes into production. Lotta Volkova, a client and their stylist, modeled for the designers\u2019 spring 2022 presentation.\n\nAll-In collections are built around characters; the (fading) star of the spring 2024 collection was Allina (a play on the brand name) a pop singer. The brand teamed up with Smerz, a Norwegian electronic duo, who created the music that was released as an EP under the name Allina, thus managing to subvert the fourth wall. Another way the brand is pushing forward is by showing some of the fall collection on a hyper-masculine male model, in part because Vestb\u00f8 and Barron are interested in wearing their own clothes. Full of surprises and fun, All-In is one of the tiny but mighty independent brands that are forging a new and uncompromising way forward in fashion.",

            "content": "By Ben Voyer and Perrine Desmichel\n\nThe reopening of Notre-Dame de Paris has recalled debate over the \u20ac200 million contribution of France\u2019s Bernard Arnault, the CEO of the LVMH luxury group, to its restoration. Announced in the hours after fire devastated the cathedral in April 2019, the donation surprised many but aligned with Arnault\u2019s track record as a cultural benefactor.\n\nFrom founding the Louis Vuitton Foundation in 2014 to regular multi-million-euro donations, including \u20ac10 million to Les Restos du C\u0153ur (Restaurants of the Heart), a French charity providing food aid, in 2023, Arnault\u2019s patronage has become almost synonymous with the LVMH brand. But what drives these expenditures? What do Arnault and his luxury empire stand to gain? And what risks are they taking?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLVMH and the arts: when luxury meets culture\n\nLuxury and culture share deep roots. Luxury brands thrive on artistry, craftsmanship and a commitment to enduring values that transcend fleeting trends. Companies like Chanel, Herm\u00e8s and Louis Vuitton invest heavily in the skills of artisans, ensuring signature creations such as iconic leather goods reflect precision and embody tradition. Other luxury houses also work with craftspersons to renovate their boutiques. This convergence of intention and skill brings luxury companies closer to the art world.\n\nBut there\u2019s another dimension: the concept of secular immortality. By associating their names with historic landmarks or cultural institutions, patrons like Arnault aim to achieve a kind of symbolic permanence. In the way that US tycoons have given their names to buildings or university departments, Arnault\u2019s ties to Notre Dame and the Louis Vuitton Foundation cement his legacy within French cultural heritage.\n\nThis strategy is about embedding oneself into collective memory, ensuring one\u2019s contributions endure far beyond the here and now. Through donations and acts, Arnault and others not only demonstrate wealth and taste but also claim a form of cultural immortality.\n\nLuxury and culture: a marriage of interest?\n\nArnault\u2019s role as a modern-day Medici highlights a dynamic in which art and business intertwine. Historically, patrons like the Medici family of Italy or King Francis I of France \u2013 a monarch who hosted Leonardo da Vinci \u2013 used art sponsorship to signal sophistication and power. In the same vein, Arnault\u2019s appearances with artists like Jeff Koons enhance his reputation as a cultural connoisseur.\n\nWhile art and business have always gone hand in hand, their relationship can be seen as a marriage of convenience, or even a forced marriage. This is reflected in the research of Yajin Wang, Alison Jing Xu, and Ying Zhang. Their study compared consumers leaving an art gallery with those who had not viewed works by Monet or Van Gogh, and found that the first group displayed less interest in nearby luxury boutiques. The researchers explained that exposure to art can bring individuals back to aesthetic and selfless values, rather than materialistic ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCultural clashes in luxury consumption\n\nWhen patronage transforms into US-style corporate foundations, it often sparks controversy in Europe. Arnault, France\u2019s wealthiest man, is no longer viewed solely as an art enthusiast but as an investor who stands to profit from the art world \u2013 particularly through mechanisms such as tax exemptions. This raises questions about the integrity of his philanthropic efforts.\n\nIn the French dictionary, the donateur (donor) is a benefactor acting in the general interest, prioritising others\u2019 welfare above personal gain. In Arnault\u2019s case, his patronage could embody selflessness or a strategic effort to compete with past and present US billionaires such as Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller or Bill Gates, whose foundations have sometimes been seen as tools for influence or personal enrichment. What risks does Arnault take in mirroring these iconic figures?\n\nThese questions are linked to a broader cultural clash. The LVMH group, under Arnault\u2019s leadership, has adopted strategies heavily influenced by US practices. Its flagship brands, Louis Vuitton and Dior, have become conspicuous markers of social success worldwide. For many young consumers, a Louis Vuitton canvas bag is a rite of passage \u2013 a first luxury purchase and a celebration of newly acquired social status.\n\nHowever, the perception of ostentatious luxury varies by culture. In the United States, such displays are celebrated as symbols of success, while in Europe, luxury consumption tends to favour understated elegance. Brands like Herm\u00e8s exemplify this ethos, focusing on craftsmanship and artistry over designer branding. Arnault\u2019s unapologetically bold approach to luxury has thus made him a polarising figure in France.\n\nThe Paris Olympics: a showcase of financial and social influence\n\nArnault\u2019s ability to blend American-style boldness with French tradition was evident during the 2024 Paris Olympics. As an official sponsor, LVMH products were omnipresent, from the opening to the closing ceremonies. Beyond financially supporting the Games, Arnault hosted a star-studded gala at the Louis Vuitton Foundation and used his social influence to get international VIPs into the stands at Olympic events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome observers credited LVMH with making the Paris Olympics a glamorous and trendsetting event, showcasing Arnault\u2019s \u201csoft power\u201d in promoting French influence on a global stage. However, his role was less contentious because it remained within the framework of private sponsorship, aligning with expectations of corporate discretion in cultural and national affairs.\n\nArnault\u2019s patronage strategy ultimately straddles two traditions: the conspicuous American style, where philanthropy serves as a marker of professional success, and the Franco-Italian tradition, which values understated and respectful sponsorship. However fragile the balance may be, it is in the best interests of France\u2019s richest man to preserve it.",

The statement pieces are available in silver and green metallics, as well as signature colors like black, gray, navy, ivory, red and tortoiseshell. Among the designs are three silhouettes set on super-light structures, as sunglasses with gold frames and as spectacles with silver frames. Two silhouettes are set on silver-tagged wire temples: a cat-eye version in black, gray and red and a wide round lens in black, brown and tortoiseshell.\n\nThe Margiela eyewear campaign was photographed and directed by Jordan Hemingway, which reflects on the alienation and attraction between humans and cyborgs. On Thursday, to mark the release of the collaboration, several stores around the world will host installations dedicated to the collection and its themes.\n\nGentle Monster counts 72 stores worldwide in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Singapore and Shanghai.

In 1971 he took control of his father\u2019s construction firm Ferret-Savinel. Eight years later he changed the company\u2019s name to F\u00e9rinel Inc. and shifted its focus to real estate.\n\nWith $15 million of his own money, Arnault, together with Antoine Bernheim, a managing partner of the French bank Lazard Fr\u00e8res and Co., raised the $80 million necessary to purchase Boussac Saint-Fr\u00e8res, a bankrupt textile company that owned the fashion house of Christian Dior. Then, in 1987, Arnault was invited to invest in LVMH by the company\u2019s chairman, Henri Racamier. Investing through a joint venture with Guinness PLC, Arnault ousted Racamier in 1990 and started to sweep a slew of fashion companies into the LVMH fold: Christian Lacroix, Givenchy, and Kenzo; the leather goods companies Loewe, C\u00e9line, and Berluti; the jeweler Fred Joailler; the DFS group (the world\u2019s biggest duty-free chain); and the beauty retailer Sephora.\n\nArnault was known in Europe as the man who revitalized French couture in 1995 by appointing British fashion designer John Galliano to replace the venerable Hubert de Givenchy at the latter\u2019s Paris fashion house. A year later the \u201cPope of Fashion,\u201d as Arnault was dubbed by Women\u2019s Wear Daily, moved Galliano to Christian Dior and appointed the brash British fashion designer Alexander McQueen to replace him at Givenchy. Arnault then hired Marc Jacobs, a young American designer, to the post of creative director at Louis Vuitton, a maker of luxury leather goods; that year, LVMH also acquired a majority stake in Jacobs\u2019s eponymous line. Although all three designers eventually left their positions, Arnault\u2019s fashion foresight had revived interest in these traditional fashion houses by the early 21st century.\n\nArnault continued to acquire luxury brands, including the Italian company Fendi (2003), the iconic French department store La Samaritaine (2010), Italian jewelry brand Bulgari (2011), and the classic American jeweler Tiffany & Co. (2021). He also built the Fondation Louis Vuitton (2014), a contemporary art museum in the Bois de Boulogne, Paris, designed by Canadian American architect Frank Gehry. In 2007 Arnault was named Commander of the Legion of Honour, one of France\u2019s highest distinctions.",

Two employees were illegal immigrants while another seven worked without the necessary documentation.\n\n\n\nThe staff's working and living conditions fell below the minimum required, the Milan court said at the time.\n\n\n\n\"The company showed a deep understanding of the rationale behind the measure, and saw this as an opportunity to strengthen and implement internal checks, aimed at avoiding a repetition of similar events,\" the court said on Friday.\n\n\n\nInvestigations by Italian magistrates, especially the Milan prosecutor's office, over the last year have uncovered alleged exploitation of workers in the fashion and luxury supply chain. Milan's Court of Justice proposed in June a nationwide scheme for luxury companies to step up checks on suppliers to ensure they comply with labour laws.",

            "content": "Total silence. That was my stunned reaction when I walked into my enormous minimalist hillside villa in Cheval Blanc\u2019s new island outpost. Then I started to giggle. Not only in surprise \u2014 of finding a blindingly white, urban-style interior perched above dense jungle on a tropical island \u2014 or delight at discovering, on its coffee table, five plates of sweet Parisian treats. But because above my butler\u2019s head, I could see bats whooshing past, their black, almost pterodactyl-like wings the antithesis of every other finely honed detail within my eye range: ancient wildlife and ultra-luxe lifestyle coming together in one bizarre moment.\n\nBefore LVMH opened its sixth Cheval Blanc \u201cmaison\u201d here (the term the French luxury goods conglomerate prefers to use for its hotels), Seychelles was known mainly for its nature: its mountainous forests speckled with rare orchids, its shell-strewn beaches lapped by warm Indian Ocean waters, its safety and its year-round sunshine. It was precisely this mix that the house\u2019s fans seemed to want next, says Vanessa Brizon, Cheval Blanc\u2019s art director. So post-Covid, LVMH bought the Banyan Tree resort on one of the island\u2019s loveliest beaches, Anse Intendance \u2014 an expansive smile of sand backed by soaring granite cliffs and birdsong-filled forests, and in December 2024 LVMH unveiled its first African resort, designed by Jean-Michel Gathy.\n\nThe Jean-Michel Gathy-designed resort\n\nFans of the French architect\u2019s aesthetic \u2014 strict geometric lines and voluminous spaces pristinely appointed in monochrome marbles, polished pale surfaces and neutral linens \u2014 won\u2019t be disappointed. Gathy has created 24 sand-coloured, boatshed-shaped pool villas along the wide beach. For those who prefer views of forests and the ever-changing tropical skies, he has perched 26 granite-coloured, flat-roofed, penthouse-style villas on stilts above the trees. And for those desiring extra privacy, he has designed three two, three and five-bedroom villas \u2014 all with, as regular maison guests might expect, quarters for private staff.\n\nStaff in chic uniforms designed by Brizon seem to appear miraculously wherever I am \u2014 whether that\u2019s walking to the resort\u2019s five restaurants, its eight-room spa or its gym with padel court, yoga room and 25m pool. My white-suited butler magically arrives on a golf buggy whenever I\u2019m walking up a hill, and is keen to arrange appointments and to unpack and press my clothes. Willing bartenders \u2014 in shirts embroidered with designs conceived, like the villas\u2019 textile art, by the Madagascan artist Jo\u00ebl Andrianomearisoa \u2014 are on hand to stir mean negronis or expand upon the vast international wine list. In the Creole-style spa, Guerlain-trained therapists are on standby to work on knotted muscles, and in the fitness area are yoga, padel and surf teachers, plus child minders to take young charges to the enormous pirate-themed kids\u2019 club.\n\nVivamento restaurant\n\nBecause the currents and waves are so strong on this part of the island, many guests, I suspect, might never leave their rooms. Instead, they\u2019ll swan about in waffle gowns and velvet-soft slippers on silken rugs. They\u2019ll dip in their private 12.5m pool, enjoy croissants and espresso. And perhaps later they\u2019ll indulge in a Guerlain massage, then a cocktail and another meal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything might persuade wealthy guests to stay here for a week (at a cost, the manager estimated, of about \u20ac25,000 for two, without alcohol), it\u2019s the variety and standard of the five in-resort restaurants. A pretty outdoor Japanese spot with lagoon views delivers dishes from sushi to blackened cod; a beachside deck offers a minimal but perfect menu of seafood and salads; a blindingly white restaurant gives anything you fancy, be it a curry or r\u00f6sti or croque monsieur. The Italian brasserie Vivamento \u2014 a 12m-high, indoor-outdoor space entered via a jaw-dropping, shell-inspired staircase and fronted by a curvaceous infinity pool \u2014 was the star, thanks to its talented 28-year-old Roman chef, Gioele Recchia.\n\nBecause the resort had just opened when I visited in December, its \u201cAlchemists\u201d (aka, concierge) hadn\u2019t yet developed their own activities. When I asked if I could trek up the mountain to take in the views, the manager called upon the entertainingly laconic former athlete Alrick Agricole (discoveryagritour.com), with whom I spent my favourite morning on Mah\u00e9.\n\nA beach villa at the resort\n\nPuffing my way up the forested mountain with him, I spotted tiny orchids and heard stories about the island\u2019s complex history, colonists and pirates. I also learnt there is not a single deadly snake, spider or plant on the island \u2014 a fact that might encourage even the most pampered of Cheval Blanc\u2019s guests to step outside their perfectly manicured pocket of paradise.\n\nDetails B&B doubles in a beach villa from $2,500, chevalblanc.com/seychelles\n\nAlphonse island in the remote outer atolls of the Seychelles\n\nAlphonse island\n\nPulling into Mah\u00e9 airport, my heart started to sink. It was December \u2014 rainy season in the Tropics \u2014 and the tail end of a cyclone was whipping giant waterdrops out of the sky. But my taxi driver was upbeat. \u201cMah\u00e9 is mountainous and catches the weather,\u201d he said as he dropped me off. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re going to Alphonse. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He was right. An hour later, having flown 250km on a 16-seater prop plane, cornflour skies replaced clouds. As we descended, the most picture-perfect, tiny little blob of flat green came into view: a 1.8 by 1.4km coconut palm-forested island, bisected by an airstrip, fringed with creamy sand and encircled by an enormous reef with shallows glimmering pale aquamarine in the midday light.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlphonse, unlike North Island or Desroches, is not a well-known destination for luxury travellers. In the remote outer atolls of the Seychelles, its lease, alongside three others making up the atoll, was acquired by a pair of keen South African conservationists, Murray Collins and Keith Rose-Innes, so that they could go fishing there. For the first five years or so the pair flew in only fishermen from around the world to cast across the 10,000 acres of hard, white sandflat shallows that teem with shoals of fish. When they realised that the fishermen\u2019s families wanted to come too, they refurbished the basic structures in 2013 \u201cso that if you stepped on the bar floor, your foot didn\u2019t go through the boards\u201d, Rose-Innes says with a laugh. Then they added a better restaurant, bar and a spa.\n\n\u2022 21 of the best things to do in the Seychelles\n\nMore recently, having started to attract moneyed fishermen such as Robin Hutson, founder of the Pig hotel chain, and the billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who took over the island the week before my visit, they upped their game, rebranding the islands as Blue Safaris, adding a glamorous thatched bar and building two stylish four-bedroom designer beach retreats with private pools, staff and grounds.\n\nOn arrival, the first thing I notice is the grins of the staff who are lined up in shorts and flip-flops, waving as passengers disembark from the plane. Formal this place is not, but friendly it is. When Cassandra Shea, the bubbly assistant hotel manager, shows me to my pool beach cottage and my transport (an all-terrain bicycle), it takes her under a minute to tell me everything I need to know. \u201cThe beach bar is that way,\u201d she points out, \u201cthe dining room\u2019s that way, the farm\u2019s that way. Just watch out for the tortoises on the roads \u2014 one\u2019s over a century old. And don\u2019t cycle across the runway without checking whether anything\u2019s landing.\u201d\n\nA four-bedroom beach retreat on the island\n\nUnable to resist meeting a 250kg tortoise (very big, very slow and slightly withdrawn \u2014 literally \u2014 if stared at long), I quickly set off on my bike, whizzing along sandy paths criss-crossed with palm shadows and exploring the long, empty beaches, the shaded hammocks strung under palm trees, the loungers lining the curvaceous pool, the spa, tennis courts, games room and, of course, the activity centre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is here, during the day, that you\u2019ll find the action, its areas bustling with anglers covetously handling fabulous rods and flies, divers trying kit, fit boys in baggy shorts examining surfboards, paddleboards and kayaks, and a cabal of young, enthusiastic watersports experts juggling guests\u2019 wishes.\n\nBecause Blue Safaris\u2019 intention is \u201cto enable guests to live their best life\u201d, as Rose-Innes puts it, a fortune has been invested in high-spec kit and boats. Anchored in the lagoon are skiffs for anglers and dive vessels kitted out with air tanks and freediving fins to explore more than 30 sites ranging from five to 200m deep. There are three comfy 25m speedboats to whizz out on conservation excursions to the tiny Bijoutier bird and turtle sanctuary, to surf reef waves or to picnic on remote sandbars.\n\n\u2022 18 of the best hotels in the Seychelles for 2025\n\nUnlike many parts of the world, explains the island\u2019s head conservationist, Elle Brighton, the reefs here are not only relatively unbleached but are part of the most healthy, biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, with more than 300 species of coral and 4,000 fish (compared with 50 corals and 500 fish species in the Caribbean). That\u2019s because being so far from land, she says, there\u2019s little agricultural pollution from pesticides and fertilisers. Deep ocean trenches nearby help to cool the water. Alphonse is part of a serious conservation project \u2014 funded by the Collins family endowment fund, donors and guests \u2014 so strict environmental rules are in place to try to ensure, as Brighton puts it, \u201cthis place remains pristine in perpetuity\u201d. This is why, when I go out every day on a boat, sightings are extraordinary. On the reefs, healthy corals teem with thousands of multicoloured fish. Beside enormous sandbanks, clouds of birds wheel about in the skies, regularly diving in the shallows for balls of baitfish. In channels, we spot giant mantas flipping on the twinkling waters and, out at sea, pods of dolphins surfing waves.\n\nDiving off the atoll\n\nUnsurprisingly, given the seriousness with which the owners approach conservation, their operation is impressively eco on the land too. A plant of 2,200 solar panels has been constructed to supply 90 per cent of the electricity. All water \u2014 for drinking and showering and swimming in \u2014 is desalinated on site. Every meal for the 137 staff and 85 per cent of all the 106 guests\u2019 food is made up of local fish or produce grown on the island\u2019s 4.5-hectare farm (on which last year they grew more than four tonnes of organic fruit and veg, of 56 types).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEqually impressively, the food, overseen by the Oz-based, South African-born chef Glenn Roberts, is sensational: tuna sashimi with farm-grown mustard-cress and ginger; roasted seabass with Ottolenghi-style salads; rich mousse using organic African-grown chocolate; and an array of ice creams flavoured with island-grown fruit.\n\nBecause of the resort\u2019s green ethos, the island attracts interesting, conservation-minded people \u2014 from chief executives of organic farming companies and founders of river charities to diving fanatics who have returned 20 times. This results in hugely stimulating conversations around the bar at night. As well as laughing a lot, I learnt a lot. Then, after two days here, I set up a direct debit to buy National Lottery tickets. That\u2019s how badly I want to return.\n\nDetails Full-board doubles in a beach bungalow from $2,136, including non-alcoholic drinks, and scheduled communal and non-motorised activities, bluesafari.com.

The two non-U.S. citizens: France\u2019s Bernard Arnault and Spain\u2019s Amancio Ortega. All of the top ten richest people as of March 1 are men. Each of them is worth $118 billion or more.\n\nWhile the Trump administration spent much of February working to slash federal employment, stocks sagged\u2013and the world\u2019s ten richest people collectively got $140 billion poorer. Elon Musk was the biggest loser of the bunch. Though he still holds onto his spot as the world\u2019s wealthiest person, a sharp downturn in Tesla shares shaved $62 billion off his fortune, as the electric vehicle maker shed a remarkable one-quarter of its market valuation in February.\n\nBack in December, Musk became the first billionaire to be worth more than $400 billion, as Tesla shares climbed and the value of Musk\u2019s privately-held artificial intelligence firm, xAI, surged thanks to new investors. But his tenure at that upper echelon was relatively short-lived. On February 10, as Tesla shares tumbled, his fortune dropped below $400 billion. And the stock kept falling. As of March 1, he\u2019s worth just shy of $360 billion, Forbes estimates.\n\nThe plunge in Tesla shares took place amid reports that purchases of Tesla vehicles have declined dramatically in Europe and states like California. In the U.S., some citizens unhappy with Musk\u2019s abrupt moves to fire federal workers in his role as a leader of DOGE-the Department of Government Efficiency\u2013have vandalised Tesla dealerships or staged protests in front of them.\n\nMark Zuckerberg had a better month, in net worth terms, becoming the world\u2019s second richest person\u2013a first for him. Zuckerberg has weaker Amazon shares to thank for his move into the No. 2 spot. A nearly 11% drop in Amazon\u2019s stock price in February erased more than $23 billion from Amazon Chairman Jeff Bezos\u2019 fortune, dragging him down to the No. 3 rank and making way for Zuckerberg to move ahead of him.

Bezos is not far behind, worth nearly $227 billion.\n\nWarren Buffett was the only one of the world\u2019d top 10 richest whose fortune grew last month.

Elon Musk\n\nElon Musk holds his spot as the world\u2019s richest person. Image: Getty\n\nNet worth: $359.5 billion\n\nSource: Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, X\n\nAge: 53\n\nResidence: Austin, Texas\n\nCitizenship: U.S.\n\nTesla shares fell more than 25% during February, erasing $62 billion from Musk\u2019s fortune, pushing it well below $400 billion.\n\nMusk, named by President Trump as a leader of the advisory group Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has with Trump\u2019s support wreaked havoc in various federal agencies in recent weeks, encouraging rapid job cuts and emailing all federal workers asking for a reply with bullet points spelling out what each worker had done the prior week; failure to reply would indicate a worker\u2019s resignation, Musk threatened. Some agency heads told their employees they didn\u2019t need to comply with Musk\u2019s request.\n\nMusk is CEO of electric car company Tesla and rocket firm SpaceX; chairman and chief technology officer of social media company X, formerly known as Twitter; and founder of artificial intelligence firm xAI. He owns 13% of Tesla stock and has pledged some of his stock as collateral for loans. The electric car maker\u2019s shareholders voted in June in favor of Musk keeping nearly $50 billion of performance based stock options in what a Delaware judge had earlier called \u201cthe largest potential compensation opportunity ever observed in public markets,\u201d when she voided the award this January and affirmed the ruling in December. A lengthy appeal of the Delaware ruling is likely ongoing. Until Musk receives those options, Forbes will continue to discount the Tesla options from the pay package by 50%.\n\nOriginally from South Africa, Musk moved to Canada before his 18th birthday, worked a variety of jobs, enrolled at Queen\u2019s University in Ontario and then transferred to University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics.\n\nIn 2000, he merged an online bank he cofounded, X.com, with a similar outfit cofounded by Peter Thiel to form PayPal, which eBay bought in 2002 for $1.4 billion. He founded SpaceX in 2002 in El Segundo, near Los Angeles. In 2004 he joined Tesla as an investor and chairman, a year after it was founded; he was later granted the cofounder title. Musk, who became CEO of Tesla in 2008, took the company public in 2010. In September 2021, Musk became the world\u2019s richest person. Musk was also the world\u2019s richest person for most of 2022\u2014until December 2022. Musk became the world\u2019s richest person again on June 8, 2023 and held onto the number one spot for the remainder of 2023. He fell to No. 2 on January 31, 2024.\n\nMusk became the world\u2019s richest person yet again in late May 2024, after his startup xAI raised $6 billion from private investors at a $24 billion valuation. xAI raised an additional $5 billion from investors in November, valuing the startup at $50 billion. He owns an estimated 54% of the company.\n\n2. Mark Zuckerberg\n\nGetty Images\n\nNet worth: $230.7 billion\n\nSource: Meta (Facebook)\n\nAge: 40\n\nResidence: Palo Alto, California Citizenship: U.S.\n\nZuckerberg rose to become the world\u2019s second richest person in late February\u2014a first for the social media mogul. He overtook Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos, whose stock fell nearly 11% during the month. Zuckerberg is now worth $4 billion more than Bezos, per Forbes\u2019 estimates.\n\nZuckerberg cofounded Facebook\u2014now called Meta Platforms\u2014when he was a student at Harvard University in 2004. It has grown to be the world\u2019s largest social network, with several billion users globally. The company also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, both of which it acquired and greatly expanded. Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, took the company public in 2012 and still owns about 13% of it.\n\n3. Jeff Bezos\n\nMichael Prince for Forbes\n\nNet worth: $226.7 billion\n\nSource: Amazon\n\nAge: 60\n\nResidence: Miami, Florida\n\nCitizenship: U.S.\n\nJeff Bezos fell from No. 2 richest to No. 3 in late February, propelled downward by a drop in the price of Amazon shares. His fortune fell by more than $23 billion over the past month as a result of the decline, which was sparked in part by Walmart warning of a slowdown in sales and profit growth this year.\n\nBezos created e-commerce giant Amazon in 1994 and ran it as CEO until July 2021 (he remains chairman); that same month he went to space on a rocket built by private rocket company Blue Origin, which he founded and has funded with billions of dollars. (Blue Origin recently announced an all-female crew going to space in its next mission this spring\u2014including pop star Katy Perry, CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King and Bezos\u2019 fianc\u00e9, Lauren Sanchez.)\n\nBefore founding Amazon.com in his garage in Seattle, Bezos worked in New York at hedge fund D.E. Shaw. Amazon began as an online bookseller at a time when few people bought goods online. The company also grew to dominate cloud storage and moved into movie and series production to feed Amazon Prime Video.\n\nBezos was the world\u2019s richest person on Forbes\u2019 list of the World\u2019s Billionaires from 2018 through 2021; he dropped to second richest on the 2022 billionaires list and No. 3 on the 2024 list.\n\nIn 2019, Bezos and his wife MacKenzie divorced; as part of the settlement, she got 4% of Amazon\u2019s shares and he kept 12%. He has since sold and given away more of his stake and owns just under 10% of the company. Since Amazon went public in 1997, Forbes calculates that he has sold more than $38 billion worth of his stock. Through his Bezos Expeditions he has invested in an array of companies, including Airbnb and software firm Workday.\n\n4. Larry Ellison\n\nJamel Toppin for forbes\n\nNet worth: $204.6 billion\n\nSource: Oracle\n\nAge: 80\n\nResidence: Woodside, California\n\nCitizenship: U.S.E\n\nEllison kept his No. 4 rank from the prior month despite an $8.8 billion dip in his fortune. Oracle shares fell about 2% in the past month.\n\nOn January 21, the day after Donald Trump was inaugurated as president, Ellison was on hand when Trump announced the Stargate Project, a venture with Ellison\u2019s firm Oracle, Chat GPT creator OpenAI, Japan\u2019s Masayoshi Son and his firm Softbank and MGX of the UAE. The group says it will spend $500 billion over four years to build AI infrastructure\u2014mainly data centers\u2014in the U.S.\n\nEllison cofounded software firm Oracle in 1977 and ran it as CEO until 2014; he now serves as chairman and chief technology officer of the company.\n\nIn 2012, Ellison bought 98% of the Hawaiian island of Lanai for $300 million. He also owns homes in California, Nevada and Florida. Ellison invested in Tesla and served on the board of the electric vehicle company from 2018 through August 2022.\n\n5. Bernard Arnault\n\nJamel Toppin for Forbes\n\nNet worth: $186.4 billion\n\nSource: LVMH/ luxury goods\n\nAge: 75\n\nResidence: Paris\n\nCitizenship: France\n\nBernard Arnault, CEO and chairman of luxury goods group LVMH, got $2.8 billion poorer amid a slight decline in the group\u2019s share price.\n\nArnault\u2019s father made millions in the construction business; to get his start, Arnault used $15 million of that fortune to buy Christian Dior. He has since built the largest luxury goods company in the world with some 70 fashion and cosmetics brands, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Moet & Chandon, Sephora and jeweler Tiffany & Co.\n\nAll five of Arnault\u2019s children work in parts of the LVMH empire. Earlier this year, Arnault nominated two of his sons\u2014Alexandre and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\u2014to the board of LVMH and in November Alexandre was named deputy CEO of LVMH\u2019s wine and spirits division. His daughter Delphine, who runs Dior, and son Antoine, already sit on the board. In June he named son Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric as head of LVMH\u2019s family holding group. His youngest son, Jean, is director of watches at Louis Vuitton.\n\nArnault was the world\u2019s richest person for most of the first half of 2023 and again from February through late May 2024.\n\n6. Warren Buffett\n\nTIMOTHY ARCHIBALD FOR FORBES\n\nNet worth: $161.1 billion\n\nSource: Berkshire Hathaway\n\nAge: 94\n\nResidence: Omaha, Nebraska\n\nCitizenship: U.S.\n\nBuffett was the only on of the top 10 with a fortune that increased in the past month, rising $14.9 billion during February. The A shares of investment conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway closed at a record high $775,000 on Friday, February 28.\n\nKnown as the \u201cOracle of Omaha,\u201d Buffett is one of the most successful investors of all time. He runs Berkshire Hathaway, which owns dozens of companies, including insurer Geico, battery maker Duracell and restaurant chain Dairy Queen. The son of a U.S. congressman, he first bought stock at age 11 and first filed taxes at age 13.\n\nBuffett created the Giving Pledge with Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates in 2010, asking billionaires to commit to give away at least half their fortune to charitable groups. Buffett has said he would donate 99% of his fortune. So far he\u2019s give more than $60 billion of Berkshire Hathaway stock to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and foundations run by his children and one started by his late first wife. That includes $5.3 billion in June 2024.\n\n7. Larry Page\n\nGetty Images\n\nNet worth: $141.5 billion\n\nSource: Google\n\nAge: 51\n\nResidence: Palo Alto, California\n\nCitizenship: U.S.\n\nPage\u2019s fortune fell by $26 billion in the past month, as Google-parent Alphabet\u2019s shares tumbled more than 13% during the month.\n\nIn late November the Department of Justice said Google should sell its Chrome browser in order to reduce the company\u2019s dominance online. In response, Google said in a statement that such a move would hurt consumers and America\u2019s technological leadership. The decision may have been one reason that Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai attended Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in January.\n\nPage cofounded search engine Google with fellow Stanford PhD student Sergey Brin in 1998 and served as CEO until 2001 and from 2011 to 2015. He now serves as a board member of Google\u2019s parent Alphabet and continues to be a controlling shareholder.\n\nPage was a founding investor in asteroid mining company Planetary Resources, which was acquired by blockchain firm ConsenSys in 2018.\n\n8. Sergey Brin\n\nGETTY IMAGES\n\nNet worth: $135.4 billion\n\nSource: Google\n\nAge: 51\n\nResidence: Los Altos, California\n\nCitizenship: U.S.\n\nLike his Google cofounder Larry Page, Brin\u2019s fortune also declined in the past month \u2014down $24.4 billion\u2014as Alphabet shares tumbled.\n\nBrin cofounded search engine Google with fellow Stanford computer science PhD candidate Larry Page. Like Page, he currently serves as a board member of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet and is a controlling shareholder.\n\nBrin came out of semi-retirement to submit changes to Google\u2019s Gemini AI chatbot last year and was listed as a \u201ccore contributor\u201d when the model was released in December.\n\n9. Amancio Ortega\n\nGetty Images\n\nNet worth: $121.9 billion\n\nSource: Zara-parent Inditex\n\nAge: 88\n\nResidence: La Coruna, Spain\n\nCitizenship: Spain\n\nAmancio Ortega keeps his No. 9 rank for the second month in a row. His fortune declined $1.4 billion in the past month.\n\nOrtega, one of the pioneers of fast fashion, founded Inditex\u2014parent of the Zara chain of stores\u2014in 1975 with his then-wife Rosalia Mera. (They later divorced and she died in 2013.) He owns about 60% of Madrid-listed Inditex, which has eight brands including Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear, and 5,000 stores around the world. In 2022, after working at Inditex for 15 years, his daughter Marta Ortega P\u00e9rez became chairperson of the company.\n\nOrtega has invested dividends from the clothing business into commercial real estate in Europe and North America.\n\n10. Steve Ballmer\n\nmark lennhan/ap\n\nNet worth: $118.9 billion\n\nSource: Microsoft, LA Clippers, investments\n\nAge: 68\n\nResidence: Hunts Point, Washington\n\nCitizenship: U.S.\n\nA drop in Microsoft shares led to a $4 billion decline in Ballmer\u2019s fortune. In late January, Microsoft issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the next quarter.\n\nBallmer, a classmate of Bill Gates\u2019 at Harvard University, joined Microsoft as employee number 30 in 1980 after dropping out of the MBA program at Stanford University. He ran Microsoft as its CEO from 2000 to 2014.\n\nWhen Ballmer retired from Microsoft, he purchased the Los Angeles Clippers team for $2 billion\u2014a record high for an NBA team at the time. Forbes now values the team at $5.5 billion. The new home for the Clippers, the Intuit Dome in Inglewood\u2014not far from Los Angeles International Airport\u2014opened in August 2024.\n\nWho is the richest man in the world?\n\nAs of March 1, 2025, the richest person in the world is Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. He\u2019s worth $359.5 billion. He moved into the number one spot in late May 2024, overtaking Bernard Arnault of France.\n\nWho is the richest woman in the world?\n\nThe richest woman in the world is Alice Walton, daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton. As of March 1, 2025, she is worth an estimated $107.5 billion and is the world\u2019s 15th richest person. Her fortune lies in her ownership stake in retailer Walmart, which she inherited from her late father. Her brothers Rob, Jim and John (d. 2005) also inherited stakes in Walmart from their father. John\u2019s widow Christy Walton and their son Lukas Walton inherited John\u2019s shares and both rank on Forbes\u2019 billionaires list.\n\nLook back on the week that was with hand-picked articles from Australia and around the world.

On the other, corsets, black lace and skimpy bra tops, totally out of tune with modern times.\n\nErmanno Daelli loves dressing women and \u201cexalting\u201d femininity. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine doing anything else,\u201d said the designer as he greeted one of his early \u2014 and favorite \u2014 models, Natalia Vodianova, backstage before the show.\n\nMore from WWD\n\nHe described the collection as a play between masculine and feminine with lots of classic fabrics \u2014 check, herringbone and houndstooth \u2014 in addition to shearling and leather.\n\nSo much of it was spot-on, from the hourglass jackets layered over short dresses, to the trouser suits with long coats in gray or powdery yellow, to the lineup of leather and shearling jackets.\n\nKnitwear was strong, too, and came in the shape of ribbed sweater jackets with fluffy collars, languid sweaters with lacing up the sides, and the cocooning, cable knit sleeves on a long, navy blue coat.\n\nThere was even a long, cozy-looking white knitted dress that should give new meaning to apr\u00e8s-ski fashion.\n\nEvening looks were just as easy. The designer paired a sheer fluttery gown, and a black velvet minidress, with flat mary janes, and layered sweater-jackets over long, embellished dresses.\n\nIn between, there were also a lot of corsets.\n\nOne was pinky beige and layered under an elegant gray suit, another was knitted with a zipper at the back, while another still was fashioned from leather. At one point, the corsets gave way to little bra tops made from wool fabric and edged in black lace.\n\nDaelli loves a corset, and often uses the shape to underpin his gossamer dresses and tailored suiting. But the full-on, corset-as-top is making these collections look out-of-touch, trapped in a 1950s Sophia Loren film, a Guess ad from the 1990s or a Halloween costume catalogue. Sexy witch, anyone?\n\nThis designer knows exactly what women want and need in their wardrobes, and he delivers it season after season. So with Gen Z practically braless, and older generations embracing feather-light shapewear, it\u2019s time for Daelli to get real, shift his gaze and deliver the sort of clothing that truly empowers women.\n\nLaunch Gallery: Ermanno Scervino Fall 2025 Ready-to-Wear Collection\n\nBest of WWD\n\nSign up for WWD's Newsletter.

Now, cleaving apart the world\u2019s biggest luxury group has moved off the drawing board and into investor discussions.An extended debate about the best way to achieve a split continues. Whichever method is chosen, it would deliver more than LVMH\u2019s current enterprise value of just under \u20ac360 billion ($377 billion). If the company wasn\u2019t controlled by the Arnault family, the owner of Louis Vuitton and Dior would be irresistible to an activist investor. Indeed, the biggest question remains whether Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault would take an ax to his empire.Views are coalescing around separating the wines and spirits unit, Moet Hennessy. Producing and selling cognac and champagne is fundamentally different from encouraging consumers to buy pricey handbags. The presence of alcohol in the portfolio also prevents some investment funds from buying into the stock.Bernstein analyst Luca Solca argues that the solution is distributing the shares in Moet Hennessy to LVMH investors. This would be similar to the route Cartier-owner Cie Financiere Richemont SA took in 2008, when the company exited its tobacco interests. Alternatively, Diageo Plc, which owns 34% of Moet Hennessy, could acquire LVMH\u2019s stake.LVMH could also eventually spin off cosmetics retailer Sephora, says Erwan Rambourg, global head of consumer and retail research at HSBC Holdings Plc. While the chain is growing fast and cash generative, it made an operating margin of about 10% in 2024, according to HSBC\u2019s estimates, well below Louis Vuitton\u2019s 50%. Synergies, even with LVMH\u2019s beauty brands, will also be slim.LVMH doesn\u2019t need to offload any of its businesses for the money \u2014 it generated more than \u20ac10 billion of free cash flow last year. This is more about how the group is perceived by investors and the worth they ascribe to it.Though exiting Moet Hennessy and Sephora would shave close to \u20ac60 billion from LVMH's enterprise value, according to HSBC\u2019s estimates, this should be more than compensated for by LVMH\u2019s multiple moving closer to that of Hermes International SCA. LVMH trades on about 12 times 2026 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, while Hermes\u2019 multiple is 32 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Plus, assuming that both divisions became listed companies rather than sold, investors would still have the shares in Moet Hennessy and Sephora, which they could keep or sell. Richemont\u2019s example is certainly compelling. Its valuation has benefited from being a pure luxury player.But dismantling doesn\u2019t have to stop there. Louis Vuitton, even on a 25% discount to Hermes \u2014 justified by the fact that though Louis Vuitton is more profitable, Hermes has more demand for its iconic handbags that it can meet \u2014 would be worth about as much as the whole of the group. So investors are getting the other brands such as Dior, Tiffany & Co. and Tag Heuer thrown in for free.There\u2019s no perfect way to cut it. Dior, the group\u2019s second-largest \u201cmaison,\u201d could theoretically sit with Louis Vuitton or bulk up the division housing other fashion brands, such as Celine and Loewe. The group also contains valuable property assets. These could in theory be listed separately as a real estate investment trust. Flexibility is enhanced by the fact that LVMH has little financial debt.Questions around LVMH\u2019s structure need to be driven primarily by valuation. But disassembling the group might help avoid potential pitfalls when it comes to succession, thrown into sharper relief in the coming years. Arnault turns 76 next week, and all his five children have senior roles in the business. Eventually, he will have to pick one to be CEO or divide responsibilities. If he chose the latter, then having the next generation lead separately listed companies might be cleaner.There would be additional costs, and there might also be some loss of clout when it comes to securing the best designers and store locations. These drawbacks are surmountable. The bigger uncertainty is whether Arnualt would really split the company he spent 40 years building.But recent comments have the market wondering.When questioned by analysts as to whether he was looking at strategic options for DFS, the operator of duty-free stores, primarily in Asia, Arnault declined to comment. This has been widely interpreted as confirmation that a review is underway.Then there is Moet Hennessy. LVMH\u2019s longtime Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jaques Guiony recently became CEO of the division, with Alexandre Arnault appointed as his deputy. Arnault senior told analysts that offloading the division was \u201cnot on the agenda.\u201d He also said the new team had two years to turn the business around. What happens when this time is up?It\u2019s still a leap from these comments to a full breakup. But LVMH\u2019s fourth-quarter performance trailed that of Richemont and Hermes. That has helped both outperform LVMH since the turn of the year.Hermes\u2019 market capitalization touched \u20ac300 billion in mid-February, though it has slipped to about \u20ac285 billion since. Arnault tried to buy Hermes more than a decade ago. It not only escaped his clutches but is now edging closer to LVMH\u2019s valuation. That may focus his mind on whether LVMH\u2019s conglomerate structure, so long a source of strength, is now a hindrance.It might not be a hedge fund that forces a rupture at LVMH, but Arnault\u2019s desire to win.",

They included Shivin Singh, founder and creative director of Absent Findings; Eileen Akbaraly, founder of Made for a Woman; Christel Abboud, founder of the brand Astart\u00e9; fashion designers Steve French Oduro, Claudia Gisele Ntsama and Victor Hart; photographer Isabella Sozinho; fashion stylist Sorelle Toledo; Byron Rosero, creative director of State Vision, and Susanna Owusu Twumwah, consultant and communication manager with experience at AMREF Health Africa.\n\nVictor Hart\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be super clear, this is not about charity,\u201d Ngonmo said. \u201cThis is about expanding the creative and business potential of the industry. Diversity is not just a normal obligation; it is an economic and creative authentication\u2026 We should not be discouraged by what is happening in the U.S., for example. We should take this opportunity to become leaders in diversity and inclusion\u2026 not only in fashion, but in the creative industry at large,\u201d she said, alluding to the pullback on DEI by many companies and organizations in the U.S. as the new administration of President Donald Trump criticizes and scales back such initiatives.\n\nDiego Della Valle\n\nSince it was established in 2015, the Afro Fashion Association has championed talents based in Italy and belonging to underrepresented communities who are active in creative and entrepreneurial industries. In 2023 the organization held its first Black Carpet Awards event, celebrating leaders of change in fields including fashion, design, food, music, sport and cinema, among others.\n\nThe second edition of the event was held last September during Milan Fashion Week.

Now, cleaving apart the world\u2019s biggest luxury group has moved off the drawing board and into investor discussions.An extended debate about the best way to achieve a split continues. Whichever method is chosen, it would deliver more than LVMH\u2019s current enterprise value of just under \u20ac360 billion ($377 billion). If the company wasn\u2019t controlled by the Arnault family, the owner of Louis Vuitton and Dior would be irresistible to an activist investor. Indeed, the biggest question remains whether Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault would take an ax to his empire.Views are coalescing around separating the wines and spirits unit, Moet Hennessy. Producing and selling cognac and champagne is fundamentally different from encouraging consumers to buy pricey handbags. The presence of alcohol in the portfolio also prevents some investment funds from buying into the stock.Bernstein analyst Luca Solca argues that the solution is distributing the shares in Moet Hennessy to LVMH investors. This would be similar to the route Cartier-owner Cie Financiere Richemont SA took in 2008, when the company exited its tobacco interests. Alternatively, Diageo Plc, which owns 34% of Moet Hennessy, could acquire LVMH\u2019s stake.LVMH could also eventually spin off cosmetics retailer Sephora, says Erwan Rambourg, global head of consumer and retail research at HSBC Holdings Plc. While the chain is growing fast and cash generative, it made an operating margin of about 10% in 2024, according to HSBC\u2019s estimates, well below Louis Vuitton\u2019s 50%. Synergies, even with LVMH\u2019s beauty brands, will also be slim.LVMH doesn\u2019t need to offload any of its businesses for the money \u2014 it generated more than \u20ac10 billion of free cash flow last year. This is more about how the group is perceived by investors and the worth they ascribe to it.Though exiting Moet Hennessy and Sephora would shave close to \u20ac60 billion from LVMH's enterprise value, according to HSBC\u2019s estimates, this should be more than compensated for by LVMH\u2019s multiple moving closer to that of Hermes International SCA. LVMH trades on about 12 times 2026 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, while Hermes\u2019 multiple is 32 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Plus, assuming that both divisions became listed companies rather than sold, investors would still have the shares in Moet Hennessy and Sephora, which they could keep or sell. Richemont\u2019s example is certainly compelling. Its valuation has benefited from being a pure luxury player.But dismantling doesn\u2019t have to stop there. Louis Vuitton, even on a 25% discount to Hermes \u2014 justified by the fact that though Louis Vuitton is more profitable, Hermes has more demand for its iconic handbags that it can meet \u2014 would be worth about as much as the whole of the group. So investors are getting the other brands such as Dior, Tiffany & Co. and Tag Heuer thrown in for free.There\u2019s no perfect way to cut it. Dior, the group\u2019s second-largest \u201cmaison,\u201d could theoretically sit with Louis Vuitton or bulk up the division housing other fashion brands, such as Celine and Loewe. The group also contains valuable property assets. These could in theory be listed separately as a real estate investment trust. Flexibility is enhanced by the fact that LVMH has little financial debt.Questions around LVMH\u2019s structure need to be driven primarily by valuation. But disassembling the group might help avoid potential pitfalls when it comes to succession, thrown into sharper relief in the coming years. Arnault turns 76 next week, and all his five children have senior roles in the business. Eventually, he will have to pick one to be CEO or divide responsibilities. If he chose the latter, then having the next generation lead separately listed companies might be cleaner.There would be additional costs, and there might also be some loss of clout when it comes to securing the best designers and store locations. These drawbacks are surmountable. The bigger uncertainty is whether Arnualt would really split the company he spent 40 years building.But recent comments have the market wondering.When questioned by analysts as to whether he was looking at strategic options for DFS, the operator of duty-free stores, primarily in Asia, Arnault declined to comment. This has been widely interpreted as confirmation that a review is underway.Then there is Moet Hennessy. LVMH\u2019s longtime Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jaques Guiony recently became CEO of the division, with Alexandre Arnault appointed as his deputy. Arnault senior told analysts that offloading the division was \u201cnot on the agenda.\u201d He also said the new team had two years to turn the business around. What happens when this time is up?It\u2019s still a leap from these comments to a full breakup. But LVMH\u2019s fourth-quarter performance trailed that of Richemont and Hermes. That has helped both outperform LVMH since the turn of the year.Hermes\u2019 market capitalization touched \u20ac300 billion in mid-February, though it has slipped to about \u20ac285 billion since. Arnault tried to buy Hermes more than a decade ago. It not only escaped his clutches but is now edging closer to LVMH\u2019s valuation. That may focus his mind on whether LVMH\u2019s conglomerate structure, so long a source of strength, is now a hindrance.It might not be a hedge fund that forces a rupture at LVMH, but Arnault\u2019s desire to win.",

After all, Lisa has been representing LVMH brands for years. In 2020, she was named Bulgari\u2019s ambassador. Interestingly, the first Instagram of Lisa\u2019s that Arnault liked is a shot of her promoting Bulgari.\n\nLisa hasn\u2019t confirmed or denied the Arnault dating rumors herself. When Billboard gave her a chance to and asked about the subject of \u201cMoonlit Floor (Kiss Me),\u201d she quipped, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t write that.\u201d\n\n\n\nFan speculation about Lisa and Arnault\u2019s potential romance began in 2022. And on Valentine\u2019s Day 2025, Arnault was seen supporting Lisa at the premiere of The White Lotus in Thailand.\n\nHere\u2019s all we know about the French businessman and his history with Lisa.\n\nLisa and Arnault first sparked dating rumors in 2022.\n\nIn November 2022, Arnault shared a photo with Lisa and her fellow Blackpink members, Ros\u00e9, Jisoo, and Jennie. He revealed he attended their Los Angeles show. \u201cWhat an amazing evening for the BlackPink concert in LA. Congratulations and see you soon in Paris !!\u201d\n\nFans noticed he started following Lisa that year and started hearting posts in early June 2022. To this day, he frequently likes her Instagrams.\n\nInstagram The first Instagram Arnault liked\n\nInstagram And the second one he liked\n\nLisa and Arnault have traveled the world together.\n\nFans have spotted hints of Lisa and Arnault\u2019s travels together since 2023, with one noticing the similarities in their social media posts when they were both in Italy.\n\nIn late January 2024, Lisa and Arnault were seen together in Paris. That year, the pair was also spotted in Hawaii, Japan, Miami, and Paris among other places.\n\nThey posed together at the TAG Heuer Formula 1 Kith launch in Miami on May 3, 2024:\n\nJohn Parra // Getty Images\n\nArnault supported Lisa at Coachella 2023 and at the 2024 Global Citizen Festival.\n\n\n\nArnault has been very supportive of Lisa\u2019s work for years. He was seen watching Lisa perform at Coachella in April 2023. The two also posed together at Blackpink\u2019s after-party.\n\n\n\nIn September 2024, Lisa debuted \u201cMoonlit Floor (Kiss Me),\u201d the Alter Ego track believed to be about Arnault, onstage at the Global Citizen Festival. He was in New York City with her, with the rumored couple being photographed eating together before her performance.\n\nArnault attended the Thailand premiere of The White Lotus on Valentine\u2018s Day.\n\nArnault went to great lengths to support Lisa\u2014and on Valentine\u2019s Day, no less. The CEO was filmed arriving at the Bangkok, Thailand premiere of The White Lotus season 3 on Feb. 14, 2025. Lisa posed by herself on the red carpet.\n\nBilly H.C. Kwok // Getty Images\n\nArnault is the son of billionaire Bernard Arnault, who is the CEO of LVMH.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric is one of Bernard Arnault\u2019s five children. His father has a net worth of $187.6 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nArnault attended \u00c9cole Polytechnique and previously worked at Facebook.\n\nArnault\u2019s career didn\u2019t just start at TAG Heuer. The entrepreneur has a business background, having graduated from France\u2019s \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 2014 with a degree in computational and applied mathematics.\n\nHe worked at Facebook and McKinsey prior to joining TAG Heuer in 2017.\n\nArnault became the CEO of TAG Heuer in 2020.\n\nHe spoke to Arabian Watches & Jewellery magazine about why he chose to join TAG Heuer of all the LVMH brands. He began working at the watch company in 2017 under Stephane Bianchi.\n\n\u201cTAG Heuer was my first watch, it\u2019s a brand I have always been close to,\u201d he said. \u201cI love the product and world of sports as well. It is also a project that symbolizes the energy of my own self. TAG Heuer is the key to innovation that can be achieved in the brand. When I first saw the watch I told myself this is something to be developed further and I joined the brand through this business unit. Then I fell in even more love with the watches, and I have the will to invest time and energy for the brand. I\u2019m the CEO for one and half year but I\u2019m with the brand for almost three years before I became the CEO.\u201d\n\nArnault and Lisa were seen together at a Bulgari event. He later shut down rumors he was going to take over the brand.\n\nOn May 16, 2023, Bulgari ambassador Lisa attended the Bulgari Mediterranea High Jewelry event in Venice. Arnault was throughout the night.\n\nClaudio Lavenia // Getty Images\n\nIn July 2023, he shut down rumors he was moving to Bulgari in an interview with Bloomberg. He hinted that his future will include work at other LVMH brands. \u201cFor now I\u2019m staying at TAG Heuer,\u201d he stated. \u201cI will eventually grow in other brands in the group, probably other categories as well, which I\u2019m also very interested in. But for the time being, I\u2019m staying at TAG Heuer, and there\u2019s still many amazing projects, too: to work on the big watches, big new boutiques and some key projects that I want to see and bring to the market.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged his presence with Lisa at the Bulgari event sparking the chatter: \u201cYou know where it came from? Because I went to Bulgari event in Venice and from there all the rumors came. I always go to fashion shows! For five years now. There you go. Why can\u2019t I go to a high jewelry event, which is like the event of the year for Bulgari?\u201d\n\nHe was appointed the CEO of LVMH Watches in 2024.\n\nArnault got a promotion, with LVMH announcing he would be overseeing Hublot, TAG Heuer, and Zenith on Jan. 1, 2024. Arnault reports to St\u00e9phane Bianchi, CEO of LVMH Watches & Jewelry Division.\n\nArnault is a Scorpio.\n\nArnault was born on Nov. 7, 1995. In 2023, Lisa further fueled dating rumors between them when she was seen in Paris during his birthday.\n\nLisa herself is an Aries, born on March 27, 1997.\n\nThe Astro Twins wrote in ELLE that the two signs have a \u201cfierce physical attraction\u201d to each other. \u201cPut your considerable talents together with Aries running the table and Scorpio handling the back of the room, and you can tap into a rich vein of wealth and thrive as a power duo,\u201d they shared.\n\nWhile Arnault regularly likes Lisa\u2019s Instagrams, he keeps his own social media business-oriented.\n\nArnault is able to keep his private life private. Most of his Instagram posts are focused on events for his LVMH watch brands. His interviews are also just focused on his work. In July 2022, Revolution Watch described Arnault as \u201crelatively self-effacing and understated... [He] prefers to let his actions and products speak for him.\u201d\n\nHowever, a Lisa/Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric fan account (yes, they exist) caught him watching one of its Instagram Stories once, so at the very least, it\u2019s no secret he\u2019s a big Lisa fan.",

            "content": "In 2020, the Glass Fire ravaged Newton Vineyard, one of Napa Valley's most scenic wineries. Situated on Spring Mountain, Newton was known for its hillside vineyards, English-style gardens, and a distinctive winery. The fire destroyed most of the vines, the winery itself, and wiped out the entire 2020 harvest. Rebuilding was expected to take years and cost millions. However, last week, owner LVMH announced to wine club members that Newton would close permanently. LVMH did not comment on the decision. The choice seems logical given LVMH's other Napa properties and the high cost of restoration. Yet, if the fire had occurred a decade earlier, LVMH might have opted to rebuild. Newton is a casualty of both the fire and changing times. U.S. wine sales have declined for four consecutive years, according to IMPACT Databank. The 2024 harvest was California's smallest in two decades, with 100,000 tons of fruit left unpicked. Tens of thousands of vineyard acres are being removed. Industry analyst Rob McMillan describes it as the biggest correction in 30 years in his \"State of the Wine Industry\" report for Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nThe coming years will be challenging for those in the wine industry. However, there is hope and work to be done. Wineries should view this as an opportunity. The decline in wine sales is not new, but the extent of the problem has been hard to gauge. During the pandemic, U.S. wine sales grew by 4.33% in 2020, but have been falling since, with a 2.4% decline estimated for 2024. The pandemic caused a surge in demand, followed by supply chain disruptions. Wholesalers and retailers still face inventory backlogs. McMillan notes that wine sales have been slowing for a decade. Growth was 5.19% in 2015, then less than 1% annually from 2016 to 2019. Sales of lower-priced wines began declining around 2017, offset by higher-priced bottles, but it was a warning sign. Now, sales are declining across almost all price points.\n\nThe shift in wine consumers is a significant factor. Neo-prohibitionists have gained traction post-pandemic, but their influence is limited. McMillan highlights that the last major correction in the wine market was in the 1980s, during a generational shift from the Greatest Generation to Baby Boomers. As Boomers aged, wine sales surpassed spirits, aided by reports of wine's health benefits. Now, another generational shift is occurring. Boomers are aging and retiring. Gen X drinks wine but is a smaller group. Millennials are settling down, and Gen Z is coming of age. These younger generations are not embracing wine in large numbers, which is a primary reason for the current challenges.\n\nToday's consumers have endless choices. In the past, wine offered variety compared to limited beer and spirits options. Now, young consumers face a plethora of choices, from artisanal spirits to hard seltzers and cannabis products. Wine struggles to capture their attention. Wine's unique qualities\u2014tradition, complexity, and food pairing\u2014are hard to convey amid colorful, trendy alternatives.\n\nMcMillan remains optimistic, stating that wine aligns with younger consumers' values\u2014being green, plant-based, natural, and often organic. However, wineries cannot wait for younger consumers to discover wine on their own. They must highlight wine's strengths while finding new ways to engage these consumers. Wine can still be enjoyed in traditional settings, but winemakers need to consider how to make wine appealing for different occasions. They should ask, \"How can I ensure younger consumers see my wine? How can I make it an option for more situations while staying true to its roots?\"\n\nWineries must also consider pricing for younger consumers, who have different financial resources than Boomers. Meeting them where their wallets are is crucial. The current market correction will not last forever. Angelo Gaja, a renowned winemaker, recently reminded me of the enduring nature of wine. He referenced Noah from Genesis, who planted vines after the flood to enjoy wine in company. Wine is here to stay. The question is how wineries will navigate and own the recovery.",

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that Lisa, alongside Doja Cat and Raye, will perform their collaborative track Born Again.\n\nThe song also featured in the third season of The White Lotus, in which Lisa made her acting debut as well. Born Again was written and produced by British singer-songwriter Raye.\n\nWhy is Lisa performing at the Oscars?\n\nDespite the buzz surrounding Lisa's upcoming performance, the announcement has stirred some controversy. Notably, none of the artists nominated for Best Original Song this year have been invited to perform, raising eyebrows about why a television theme song \u2014 with no direct link to any nominated films \u2014 is taking center stage at the Oscars.\n\nThree global superstars. One epic #Oscars moment. Doja Cat, LISA of Blackpink, and RAYE take the stage for a showstopping celebration of cinema.\n\n\n\nWatch the Oscars LIVE Sunday, March 2, at 7e/4p on ABC and Hulu, with Conan O\u2019Brien hosting.

Arnault oversees luxury brands such as Zenith, Hublot, and TAG Heuer, while Lisa has long-standing partnerships with LVMH brands like Celine, Bvlgari, and Louis Vuitton. Some fans suspect LVMH's sponsorship of the Oscars may have played a role in securing her spot on the prestigious stage.\n\nFan reactions\n\nReactions have been mixed as while Lisa's fans are thrilled about her Oscars debut, others have questioned the relevance of her performance at an event meant to honour cinematic achievements. Speculation about LVMH's influence has only added fuel to the ongoing debate.\n\nDoja is performing at the Oscar\u2019s for absolutely no reason other than Lisa\u2019s boyfriend using his daddy\u2019s money to pay off the academy and have LISA every damn where in the US.

Queen Latifah, a former Oscar nominee, is also set to perform despite having no direct connection to this year's nominated works. Additionally, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande \u2014 both nominated for acting roles in Wicked \u2014 will perform songs from the film, though not the ones that received Oscar nominations.\n\nThe event will be broadcast live, with streaming available on Disney+ Hotstar, covering both the red carpet and the main ceremony.\n\nFor more news and updates from the world of OTT, and celebrities from Bollywood and Hollywood, keep reading Indiatimes Entertainment.",

At just 19 mm in diameter and 3.90 mm in thickness, the Lady Solotempo weighs only 5 grams, yet boasts a 50-hour power reserve. All the Serpenti models powered by the Lady Solotempo BVS100 have transparent sapphire crystal casebacks. There are seven models to choose from, ranging from the two high jewellery references to everyday stainless steel and two-tone models\n\nPrice: $10,200-$126,000 (Enquire at: www.bulgari.com)\n\nTAG Heuer Carrera Chronograph Tourbillon\n\nPurple-a colour associated with royalty is making inroads into the watch world. Not surprising, as quite a few watches today are meant for modern-day royalty. The TAG Heuer Carrera Chronograph Tourbillon, with a smokey purple dial, is one such watch. Limited to only 200 pieces, it is truly a collector\u2019s item. At 42mm wide, the tourbillon is powered by an in-house movement\u2014the Heuer 02 TH20-09-which counteracts the effects of gravity for precise timekeeping.

This fourth model in its Gentissima Oursin collection (oursin is French for sea urchin) is sized at 36 mm and comes with a yellow gold case that is set with 137 individually mounted fire opal gems which surround an orange carnelian dial. The Oursin is limited in production and will be available in May 2025\n\nPrice: On request (Enquire at: www.geraldgenta.com)\n\nZenith Chronomaster Sport Rainbow\n\nIf you are looking for a bit of bling, but also want the high precision of a sports watch, the Zenith Chronomaster Sport Rainbow\u2014the culmination of almost 160 years of research in watchmaking innovation\u2014is perfect for you. The multicolour watch in white gold is set with 10 baguette-cut diamonds and 52 rainbow-coloured sapphires on the bezel. The watch is powered by the El Primero 3600 movement that offers a 1/10th of second indication and has a 60-hour power reserve.

The 37mm watch has an unconventional design where the sculpted window on the watch face reveals the hours and minutes, while the rest of the watch face is mirror-polished in a reflective pink gold, adding to the retro charm. It has an open case back that exposes its inner workings.\n\nPrice: Rs 35 Lakh (Enquire at: www.in.louisvuitton.com)\n\nHublot Big Bang Meca 10 42mm\n\nHublot has always been coveted by watch aficionados for its technological innovations, especially its skeletal design which allows one to look directly at the watch\u2019s complex mechanics. When it launched the original Big Bang Meca 10 in 2016, in a 45mm size, it was considered an engineering masterpiece. Now it has gone a step further and has launched it in 42mm.

            "content": "Your customer of tomorrow may be rather unlike your customer today. And if you are not connecting with them, there is a lot of catching up to do.\n\nWedged between heritage and changing customer behaviours, the world of luxury perhaps feels the need to remain relevant most acutely. In a recent fireside chat, we explored how, as the world\u2019s largest luxury conglomerate, LVMH stays relevant in the face of changing demographics and rapidly evolving trends.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, maintaining relevance involves ensuring that LVMH brands uphold great consistency in the face of competition, which, in turn, encourages a broader and less constrained sense of creativity.\n\nTo stay relevant, get creative\n\nHeritage is at the heart of luxury brands and a significant aspect of their allure. Even so, it needs to be interpreted \u2013 and reinterpreted \u2013 to reflect the times. One of the complexities of managing luxury brands relates to the articulation of heritage vs. modernity. That is where creativity comes in.\n\nAt LVMH, heritage is presented in a modern way through creativity around its three pillars: product design, storytelling and client experience. But for a business group with over 75 luxury brands, there is no standard model.\n\nIn practice, creativity needs to be delegated to the people close to the business and the customers. This means that individual brands and business units within the group must have the autonomy to make decisions \u2013 from products to distribution, manufacturing and other support functions. In-store experience cannot be replaced, but in the age of online shopping, creativity helps create value for the customers beyond a mere transaction. In other words, it is about establishing a memorable customer experience. Of course, the balance between heritage and creativity varies with the product category. Take luxury watches and fine wines, where many classics are not expected to evolve significantly. Even if little creativity is required in the design of these luxury products, creative storytelling is much needed, as exemplified in the storytelling mastery of luxury watch maker Patek Philippe. Also read: Is India the next global luxury hub? Leveraging technology for creativity and growth In fashion and luxury, the age of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought data analytics to a new level. This can potentially boost creativity and growth. Through the smart management of large pools of data, AI can play an important role in the development of products \u2013 even the art of cognac making, which is traditionally the domain of trained professionals. In fashion and luxury, the age of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought data analytics to a new level. This can potentially boost creativity and growth. Through the smart management of large pools of data, AI can play an important role in the development of products \u2013 even the art of cognac making, which is traditionally the domain of trained professionals. At Hennessy, for example, cognac-making involves a team of seven members tasting over 30 samples every day to arrive at their joint evaluation. While the large volumes of data produced daily is beyond human capabilities to analyse, perhaps AI could one day overcome human limitations by creating relationships and rules to document the complexity of the different taste profiles. Today, this is not yet a reality. But the possibility of leveraging AI to further knowledge in a domain traditionally dependent on human expertise refined over years is an exciting prospect. AI \u2013 when associated with other technologies such as virtual reality \u2013 is also a game changer in the world of fashion, not by replacing in-store experience, but enabling consumers to \u201cexperience\u201d different products before even stepping into a store. AI tools can help customers identify products that fit them well and allow brands to personalise their recommended products to individual customers. The effectiveness of such features is highly dependent on whether brands succeed in creating truly representative avatars of the consumer in three-dimension. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can also be a powerful marketing tool when associated with an actual product (be it existing or future). Just picture this: If an exclusive bottle of Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Yquem were to be introduced, creating NFTs of the bottle could generate interest, ahead of the launch, in the exquisite Sauternes wine \u2013 the only Premier Cru Sup\u00e9rieur in its category \u2013 and its unique bottle. Fundamentally, brands should embrace AI and other technologies with creativity if they want to enhance the value of the brand and the group, bearing in mind that value may not always directly be of a financial nature. These tools can bring intangible benefits, such as enhancing storytelling and increasing brand equity. Creativity, facilitated by technology, takes time before financial benefits materialise. Luxury has a long time horizon, so it is uniquely positioned to benefit from the positive effects of creativity. Strategies for staying relevant In the quest to keep their products relevant, companies must look beyond product offerings. One way is to create experiences around products and brands that are meaningful and authentic, as Louis Vuitton and LOEWE did. The artistic directors of these LVMH maisons have built complete brand cultural universes. This involves crafting consistent narratives, brand identities and sets of values that resonate with target audiences and differentiate the brand \u2013 such as causes that their customers and audiences can connect with. This is very salient in the case of Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior\u2019s creative director since 2016, who marries fashion with empowering women and girls in their local communities.

This is very salient in the case of Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior\u2019s creative director since 2016, who marries fashion with empowering women and girls in their local communities. Going a step further into the future, brands can build brand equity and relevance among their potential customers. For example, Sephora readily gives away samples to students visiting their stores. Even if these students may lack purchasing power today, their positive experience and exposure to Sephora products make them more likely to become loyal customers in the future. In other words, brands can enlarge their brand message to a wider audience. Another often overlooked element is the people within the organisation. An organisation is a living body nourished by its people, and people are an important part of the company\u2019s culture. In particular, new employees, such as the artistic directors of Louis Vuitton and Dior mentioned earlier, are important actors in shaping the culture by bringing in new ideas and energy to the brand, and eventually driving financial performance.\n\n[This article is republished courtesy of INSEAD Knowledge, the portal to the latest business insights and views of The Business School of the World.

Since its debut in Dubai in 2020, where it showcased four of LVMH\u2019s esteemed watchmaking houses \u2013 Bvlgari, Hublot, TAG Heuer, and Zenith \u2013 the event has grown exponentially in scale and significance. Over the years, the inclusion of brands such as Daniel Roth and Gerald Genta has further elevated its prestige. The showcase reached new heights this year as it welcomed three additional maisons \u2013 Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., and Swiss clockmaker L\u2019Epee 1839 \u2013 bringing the total number of participating brands to nine.\n\nOriginally set to take place in Los Angeles, this year\u2019s event was relocated due to the devastating California wildfires. Instead, LVMH Watch Week unfolded across two of the world\u2019s major fashion cities: New York City from Jan 21 to Jan 22, and Paris from Jan 30 to Jan 31. The flagship Tiffany & Co. store on Fifth Avenue in The Big Apple served as the primary venue, alongside the nearby Louis Vuitton and Bvlgari boutiques. Meanwhile, the luxurious Cheval Blanc Paris hotel provided a majestic setting for the European leg of the event.\n\nAs the first major watch industry event of 2025, LVMH Watch Week set the tone for the year\u2019s horological landscape with an extraordinary display of innovation, artistry, and technical mastery. From ultra-thin dress watches and high-performance sports models to dazzling high jewellery creations and avant-garde complications, the event showcased the full spectrum of LVMH\u2019s watchmaking expertise. Here, we take a closer look at the launches from each of the participating maisons that offered a glimpse into the creativity and craftsmanship that define this year\u2019s novelties.",

            "content": "Yesterday, the London Fashion Week came to a gentle close with the Burberry show, after showcasing various FW25-26 collections that were all more avant-garde and intriguing than the last. Yet, before diving headfirst into analyzing the new pieces debuting this week at Milan Fashion Week, followed by Paris, let\u2019s not rush. Instead, let\u2019s pause to highlight a French fashion figure who managed to stand out among British designers. Amidst renowned names on the London scene like Thom Browne, rising stars such as Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Dwyer, and those embodying British eccentricity like Dilara Findikoglu, Pauline Dujancourt, a young Parisian designer, held her own among the greats, captivating all attention with her delicate FW25 collection.\n\nAfter studying fashion and textile design at Paris\u2019s \u00c9cole Duperr\u00e9 and earning a master\u2019s degree from Central Saint Martins in London, she developed a particular love for wool work, crochet, and knitting. She launched her eponymous brand in 2022 after honing her skills with prominent British designers, including Simone Rocha. Last year, she competed alongside Duran Lantink, Ellen Hodakova Larsson, and her Belgian neighbor Marie Adam as a finalist in the coveted LVMH Prize. Although she left empty-handed, the French designer has since continuously demonstrated her quiet strength. Inspired by her grandmother, Pauline\u2019s FW25-26 collection was a tribute to delicacy and sensitivity, centered around the concept of blooming: \u201cWhen my grandmother was alive, my father and his siblings gave her a plant with a large flower. It died and never bloomed again,\u201d she told British Vogue. \u201cWhen she passed away, my uncle kept the plant and propagated it so the entire family could have one. For my uncle, aunt, and father, the plant now blooms every February, which we find beautiful as my grandmother\u2019s birthday was in February.\u201d\n\nThe delicacy of flowers is reflected through a precise sense of draping, both fragile and powerful, with deconstructed silhouettes designed to regrow like the plant that inspired Pauline. Lightweight materials such as mohair, silk satin, and feathered tulle blended with wool create the perfect balance between heaviness and airiness. Inspired by the works of British artist Tracey Emin, the pieces are painted in hues ranging from deep, dramatic reds to ethereal greys, symbolizing mourning, the need to hold onto memories, and the desire to let go to avoid pain. Unlike her British peers, who may take a more radical or provocative approach, Pauline subtly and gently captures the attention of fashion insiders with an authentically sensitive and organic style that resonates with her entire audience, from the prickliest roses to the most delicate orchids.",

The World Cup is the most-watched sporting event ever.\n\nThe NFL knows this, but they\u2019re trying to put a dent in the soccer love.\n\nThis fall, seven games will be played internationally, the most ever. Games in Spain, Brazil, Ireland, and three in England.\n\nIn 2026, they\u2019ll stage a game in Australia. So the NFL is only expanding more and more.\n\nAnd these are all regular season games, counting in the standings.\n\nWhen the English Premier League sends teams to summer American tours, it\u2019s all preseason games, with starters playing limited minutes.\n\nSo yes the NFL isn\u2019t the biggest sport on Earth, but at least they have a gameplan to put a dent in soccer\u2019s popularity.\n\nF\u00daTBOL\n\nFashion and soccer collided when the Arnault family bought soccer club Paris FC.\n\nBernard Arnault is the majority shareholder and head of LVMH. Aranualt\u2019s net worth is $186 billion.\n\nLVMH stands for Louis Vuitton-Mo\u00ebt-Hennessy. LVMH owns brands Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Guerlain, Givenchy, Parfums Christian Dior, Bulgari, TAG Heuer, Chaumet, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, and Dom P\u00e9rignon.\n\nIf it\u2019s luxury, LVMH is connected.\n\nParis FC is a second-tier club in France. They also brought in energy drink giant Red Bull on as a minority stakeholder. With that heavyweight financial support, Paris FC is currently second in French Ligue 2.\n\nThree teams from Ligue 2 get promoted to Ligue 1. If Paris FC does go up, their stadium is next door to another club with heavy financial backing, Paris Saint-Germain.\n\n\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\udfdf\ufe0f With Paris FC cleared to play at the Stade Jean-Bouin starting in 2025/26, they will be mere metres away from the home of neighbouring PSG.\n\n\n\nIn the event Paris FC are promoted to Ligue 1 this summer, they will be the closest two stadia in a major European league next term. pic.twitter.com/f7yVVWBgSB \u2014 The Sweeper (@SweeperPod) February 13, 2025\n\nParis Saint-Germain is owned by Qatar Sports Investments. The Qatar Investment Authority\u2019s asset valuation is around $450 billion.\n\nFOOD\n\nI went to Gio\u2019s Pizza for the first time four years ago. I was immediately hooked.\n\nOwners Mia and Travis Posey make everything homemade from the meatballs to the pizza. I think it\u2019s one of the best slices in New Orleans.\n\nI bring newbies to Gio\u2019s all the time, and they\u2019re quite surprised how darn good the pie is.\n\nWell, Barstool founder Dave Portnoy put Gio\u2019s on another level after his review of the Metairie pizza joint.\n\nNow, they sellout of food at 1 p.m. some days. The Posey\u2019s stay later each day to make sure they can serve more people the next day.\n\nGreat things happen to great people, and that\u2019s the case at Gio\u2019s.\n\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?

While they probably all had different reasons for sitting it out, it\u2019s clear that such labels are shifting their priorities to where it matters most and that the appeal of organising a show \u2013 which can cost up to US$100,000 and is a big investment for an independent brand \u2013 is not what it used to be.\n\nIn recent years British-based brands in particular have had to deal with issues including the downfall of luxury online retailers such as Matches and Farfetch; Brexit, which has made it harder for them to export their products and source materials from continental Europe; and the end of the VAT tax refund, which has made the UK, and London especially, less appealing to overseas shoppers.\n\nThese are just some of the matters \u2013 let\u2019s not forget the pandemic \u2013 that Caroline Rush has had to deal with during her 15-year tenure as chief executive of the British Fashion Council, as she explains in an interview in London.\n\nPictured in 2022, Caroline Rush, departing chief executive of the British Fashion Council, has been instrumental in raising the global profile of London Fashion Week. Photo: Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become just so adept at dealing with crises,\u201d says Rush, who is leaving her post this year. \u201cWe\u2019ve been sort of in a combative mode, really, in trying to be there to champion the industry and help designers figure out how to navigate all of this.\u201d\n\nAs for the many \u201cno-shows\u201d this season, Rush explains that not holding a show is not necessarily a bad thing. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for designers to think about their collection and how they want to communicate,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes the media and the retailers see [not having a show] as a lack of confidence in what they\u2019re doing, but we just see it as actually good business sense if they\u2019re focusing on the product and what they can deliver.\u201d\n\nShe adds that designers can significantly decrease the cost of producing a runway presentation by using spaces provided by the British Fashion Council and taking advantage of the resources made available to them by the institution.",

Revenue is down slightly at -2%, before adjustments for the various exchange rate fluctuations, profit fell by 28%. LVMH points out this is due to major investments in store renovations and communications, with individual brands in the portfolio, such as Tiffany, notching up stand-out performances.\n\nRichemont, home to four jewellery houses: Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, Vhernier and Buccellati and watch brands including Baume et Mercier, IWC, Jaeger-LeCoultre and Piaget recently celebrated pretty strong numbers. The jewellery houses notched a 14% rise in sales, which Richemont credited to its \u2018iconic\u2019 brands\u2019 success.\n\nThe Specialist Watchmakers division recorded a total year decline in sale of -8%. However, this was significantly smaller than the -first half\u2019s -16% as sales bounced back in the last six months.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt the market is changing; luxury brands can\u2019t rely on heritage alone, but people will always want something better, something that transcends trends, that lasts, that is storied\u2026 2025 will be an interesting year.",

Both were aspiring property moguls at the time.\n\nLater that decade, Arnault shifted his focus to luxury brands, purchasing Christian Dior and beginning his acquisition of LVMH. He also invested in real estate, including properties on Fifth Avenue, close to Trump Tower.\n\nIn the weeks before Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017, Arnault was identified as one of the first business leaders to travel to the US to pay homage. His son, Alexandre Arnault, who had known Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner for years, joined him.\n\nThere are no signs that this partnership has weakened in recent years; in fact, it seems to have only grown stronger.\n\n\u201cThe day after President Trump survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania last summer, he received a call from a familiar French voice. It was Bernard Arnault, owner of the globe-spanning luxury empire LVMH,\u201d writes Nick Kostov.\n\n\u201cArnault wanted to check in on the man he had known for decades. Trump was also in the middle of a fierce presidential campaign, as well as several criminal proceedings.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe phone call from Arnault sent a clear signal: The luxury titan was sticking with Trump through thick and thin.\u201d\n\nThis political support was again emphasised during Trump\u2019s second inauguration in January, when Arnault appeared at the Capitol Rotunda alongside his wife, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mercier-Arnault, and two of his five children, Alexandre and Delphine.\n\n\u201cWho would refuse an invitation from the president of the United States to attend their inauguration?\u201d Besides, I\u2019ve had a longstanding relationship with him,\u201d Arnault said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The phone call from Arnault sent a clear signal: The luxury titan was sticking with Trump through thick and thin.\" Nick Kostov, The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe connection between the children of the unlikely pair continues with daughter Ivanka Trump, who is close with Arnault\u2019s daughter, Delphine, and a major supporter of the Dior brand.\n\nThe report reveals that when LVMH purchased Tiffany & Co. in 2021 in a landmark billion-dollar deal, Arnault personally informed Trump of a major upcoming deal beforehand.\n\nAmong the other interesting observations, the Trump Organisation is the landlord of the Louis Vuitton store in Midtown Manhattan. Trump\u2019s well-known \u2018air rights\u2019 agreement above the Tiffany & Co. flagship store is also highlighted.\n\nThe current president was reportedly so pleased with the deal that he named his daughter Tiffany after the brand \u2014 which Arnault now owns!\n\nTension & Tariffs & Tiffany\n\nThe report also details the significance of Trump\u2019s proposed steep tariffs on European luxury products, which could negatively impact LVMH.\n\nIt\u2019s suggested that Arnault has worked to leverage his personal relationship with Trump to protect LVMH from trade wars. This involves LVMH\u2019s significant investment in the US, with a Louis Vuitton factory in Texas being one of 14 factories.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s evident that we\u2019re being strongly encouraged by US authorities to continue expanding our presence there. And I must say that, given the current environment, this is something we are seriously considering,\u201d Arnault explained in January.\n\nBackground reading: TIMELINE: Inside the Tiffany & Co. and LVMH merger\n\nIn 2019, Trump imposed tariffs on European goods; however, he spared luxury items such as champagne and handbags due to Arnault\u2019s investment in US production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can\u2019t tax him [Arnault] because he moved to the United States. He was very smart. He was way ahead.\" Donald Trump, US President\n\nWhen French media asked Trump why the tariffs were so selective, he conceded he had been discussing the issue with Arnault.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tax him [Arnault] because he moved to the United States. He was very smart. He was way ahead,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe report speculates that future tariffs may be determined in part by the relationship between the two unlikely friends.\n\n\u201cWith Trump now in office and warning of steep tariffs on European goods, the question is whether Arnault can leverage his connection to keep his luxury conglomerate out of any trade wars,\u201d Kostov continues.\n\n\u201cTariffs would be a blow to Arnault\u2019s empire, whose largest market is the US \u2014 equal in size to all of Europe combined. Trump has called the European Union\u2019s trade surplus with the US an \u2018atrocity\u2019, but he also often leans on personal relationships to guide his policy.\u201d\n\nLVMH recently reported a group revenue decline of 2 per cent over the past financial year, reaching \u20ac84.68 billion ($AUD141.73 billion).\n\nMore reading\n\nDonald Trump's lab-created diamond lookalike\n\nElection fever: Trump showcases line of luxury watches\n\nBest is yet to come for LVMH despite sales dip\n\nLVMH under fire as Olympic Games controversy emerges\n\nLVMH CEO denies knowledge of illegal surveillance\n\nGlobal uncertainty impacts revenue for LVMH\n\n10 years: LVMH and Formula 1 agree to massive deal",

Brands across the sector recorded healthier sales to end off the year, giving the industry a bit of a boost and signaling a turnaround in the market.\n\nHerm\u00e8s reported a nearly 18 percent jump in fourth-quarter revenue last year compared to the year prior, in a strong showing on the luxury market. The Birkin maker also saw its sales rise 11 percent in Q3 of 2024. Luxury conglomerate LVMH, meanwhile, had its overall sales jump 1 percent year-over-year in 2024, hitting $88 billion, with sales in the three months to December also surpassing expectations.\n\nAnd as for Richemont\u2014the parent company of Cartier, Vacheron Constantin, and other luxe labels\u2014it reported its \u201chighest-ever\u201d quarterly sales in 2024\u2019s Q4, CNBC reported. LVMH\u2019s chief rival, Kering, also noted better-than-expected sales to end off last year.\n\n\u201cThe conclusion seems to be the worst is behind us\u2014that was most likely the third quarter of 2024\u2014and we\u2019re seeing a cyclical recovery in progress, driven by the U.S. consumers and European consumers, for the most part,\u201d Luca Solca, senior analyst for global luxury goods at Bernstein, told CNBC.\n\n2024\u2019s slowdown, in part, was due to struggles with Chinese consumers, who spent less on luxe goods in general last year. Those issues may trickle into 2025 as well, with Gucci, owned by Kering, reporting declining sales in the country and netting $1.92 billion in 2024\u2019s fourth quarter\u2014a drop of 24 percent compared to the year prior. And while LVMH, a bellwether of the luxury industry, reported those better-than-expected full-year sales in 2024, it still cited continued weakness in Asia, which contributed to the behemoth\u2019s fashion and leather goods department to record a drop in sales for the first time since the pandemic this past October.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s impending tariffs, along with broader economic uncertainly, may spell out more trouble for the luxury sector, according to CNBC. \u201cWe\u2019re already coming off of heavy price increases. If firms were to have 25 percent tariffs, it will be hard to offset these,\u201d Simone Ragazzi, portfolio manager at Algebris Investments, told the network. Both Kering and brands such as Herm\u00e8s have already showed signs that they may potentially increase prices of goods to offset any extra duties, CNBC reported.\n\nWhether those changes will come to fruition remains an open question, but luxury market observers will certainly be watching closely.",

            "content": "LONDON \u2014 The Formula 1 season doesn\u2019t start until mid-March, but already, TAG Heuer can feel the traction from a deal reportedly worth $1 billion, which made it the sport\u2019s new official timekeeper and title sponsor of the Monaco Grand Prix.\n\n\u201cIn January, we saw a double-digit increase in the number of people coming to our stores compared to the same period last year,\u201d said TAG Heuer\u2019s new chief executive Antoine Pin in an interview with The Business of Fashion ahead of the opening event for F1\u2019s 75th anniversary season, held at London\u2019s O2 arena last week.\n\nThe Swiss watchmaker\u2019s role was made public January 6 by parent company LVMH, following an announcement last October that the French conglomerate had signed a multi-brand 10-year deal with F1\u2019s owners Liberty Media. Alongside TAG Heuer\u2019s timekeeping, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon become the sport\u2019s official champagne while Louis Vuitton will provide trunks for race trophies among other activations. The role confirmed TAG Heuer\u2019s emergence as the LVMH Watch Division\u2019s darling.\n\nPin said it would take time before the impact the partnership would have on sales became clear. \u201cThe momentum is building up, but it\u2019s still very early,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTAG Heuer\u2019s new chief was appointed in September from LVMH stablemate Bulgari. He succeeds Julien Tornare, who moved over to Hublot after just 8 months in the job. The group\u2019s watch division is headed by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, son of LVMH chairman Bernard.\n\nTAG Heuer was first involved in F1 in the late 1960s and remains a sponsor of the Oracle Red Bull Racing Team and current F1 World Champion Max Verstappen. It last took care of timekeeping between 1992 and 2003. LVMH is understood to have outbid F1\u2019s previous timekeeper Rolex, which had timed races for the past decade.\n\nAccording to George Ciz, TAG Heuer\u2019s chief marketing officer, who was present in the same interview, news of the deal has prompted a spike in social engagements, too. \u201cFour years ago we were the number seven [watch] brand on Instagram,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we jumped to third by 2023, and last year we were second. In January, we were first, ahead of Rolex and Omega, and not by a small margin.\u201d\n\nDrone footage of TAG Heuer's party at the Monaco Grand Prix. (TAG Heuer)\n\nIndependent data backed up the claim. \u201cTAG Heuer was the fastest growing brand on our benchmark panel, up 8 percent year-on-year in 2024,\u201d said Benjamin Dubuc, innovation director and partner at Digital Luxury Group (DLG), a Geneva-based consultancy. Posts featuring Red Bull Racing, which TAG Heuer first partnered in 2016, and the Netflix racing series \u201cSenna\u201d performed particularly well.\n\n\u201cTAG Heuer\u2019s posts averaged 20,000 likes per post, while competitors [Breitling, Longines and Tudor] averaged only 4,300 likes per post,\u201d Dubuc said. \u201cEngagement levels suggest a strong emotional connection to F1-driven content.\u201d He noted that TAG Heuer\u2019s Formula 1-driven social media strategy had resonated particularly well in the US, where its share of search demand was up 3 percent to record levels in December.\n\nCiz said he hadn\u2019t invested heavily in directly promoting the brand on Instagram, but that the results stemmed from a high degree of natural interest in its activities with F1, the Automobile Club of Monaco and Senna Foundation. \u201cWe didn\u2019t spend silly money on this: most of it was organic,\u201d he said.\n\nSurging interest in TAG Heuer comes at a time when the luxury watch industry is battling strong headwinds. Exports are down and many brands have put staff on short-hours contracts as retailers reduce orders in a bid to offset swelling inventories.\n\nTAG Heuer, however, may already be bucking the trend. LVMH does not publish revenues by brand, but according to Morgan Stanley\u2019s influential Swiss watch report, published this month, last year TAG Heuer was one of only a handful of luxury watchmakers to increase sales. The report\u2019s estimates indicated TAG Heuer\u2019s revenues climbed 9 percent to 670 million Swiss francs against an industry average of -2.4 percent. Pin declined to confirm Morgan Stanley\u2019s figures, but said they were close to actual.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile Pin said this made him \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d, he wasn\u2019t making any big forecasts. \u201cYou would expect that the developments you\u2019re making are having a positive impact on your business,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the other hand, we know we\u2019re not in the best economic conditions.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe beauty of this deal is that it\u2019s a 10-year deal. The complexity for us is to maintain constant pressure and to think long-term. This industry doesn\u2019t adjust to the ups and downs of the economy overnight. So you are balancing between the optimism of this major decision to go back into F1 and the positive impact it should have on our business, and on the other end, being conservative in terms of the economic fundamentals where basically you\u2019re not sure that people will have more disposable income in 2025 than in 2024.\u201d\n\nResearch suggests it\u2019s a good time to be on the roster of F1 sponsors. A report released in December by Nielsen Sports, the sports measurement and analytics agency, indicated that F1 is now the most followed sports series in the world with a global TV audience of 1.5 billion. Since 2021, global interest in F1 has added roughly 50 million new fans, according to the report, making it the fastest growing annual sports competition in the world.\n\nFor TAG Heuer, the partnership may yet be measured against the US market, which Pin confirmed is TAG Heuer\u2019s largest, adding that the Americas, including F1 hotspots Brazil and Mexico, account for one third of the company\u2019s total revenues.\n\nIn recent years, Formula 1 has grown in popularity in the US on the back of the Netflix series \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d, while new races in Miami and Las Vegas have pulled in big crowds and record TV audiences. Race weekend attendance at the Miami Grand Prix last year increased to 275,000 from 243,000, and the race attracted the largest ever F1 US TV audience in the sport\u2019s history, according to organisers.\n\nThe US is by far Swiss watchmaking\u2019s largest market, and still growing. The Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry (FHS) recorded export values to the US of 4.4 billion Swiss francs in 2024, up 5 percent on 2023 and 12.4 percent on 2022, record years for the industry as the pandemic bounce kicked in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good equation,\u201d admitted Pin. \u201cEverything is fitting together. And these new [US] races bring the same glamour you find in Monaco, so the ingredients are there that make really bubbling moments. Hopefully we should take advantage of that.\u201d\n\nChina, by comparison, remains in a slump and after years of decline now accounts for Swiss watch exports valued at 2 billion Swiss francs, down 26 percent year-on-year in 2024 alone, according to the FHS.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPin says TAG Heuer is \u201cunder-represented in China compared to the industry\u201d and that it still has to \u201cprove itself\u201d in the country. Next month, F1 will return to China for the first time since 2019.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re clearly a very small player [in China] compared to the rest of the world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not in our top 10. We came late to China and when we did, in the late 2000s, we were impatient and tried to do too much. Sports watches were not prized there, but the market has changed and the Grand Prix is an opportunity for us to express what we are properly.\u201d\n\nTAG Heuer has yet to announce how it will activate the partnership on race weekends, but Ciz said the pitlane exit would have a 1.2-metre TAG Heuer clock and that an LVMH steering group had been set up to coordinate VIP experiences. He said the group would be taking around 120 people to each race weekend.\n\nBut Ciz said TAG Heuer\u2019s multi-layered involvement in the sport would provide it with unique storytelling opportunities. \u201cWhat makes us different from any other partner is that we have a partnership with a circuit [Monaco], with the world champion Max Verstappen, and with Red Bull Racing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the nirvana moment, where you have the competition and the best athlete in it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pin, TAG Heuer will invest nearly 20 percent of its revenues in marketing this year, in keeping with the brand\u2019s historic average. \u201cWe\u2019re not just supervising the race, we\u2019re engaged in the competition,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emotion of winning is super important to us. We\u2019ll make a lot of buzz, but it\u2019s a marathon we\u2019re running. It can\u2019t be that we do something for one season and then repeat ourselves. It won\u2019t be business as usual year-on-year.\u201d\n\nPin said F1 would be used to promote each of the company\u2019s five current model families, including the Formula 1 typically the company\u2019s entry-level product line. At LVMH Watch Week last month, TAG Heuer added new chronographs to the Formula 1 collection, priced around $5,000, and it is expected to introduce a more accessible line at Watches and Wonders Geneva, the industry\u2019s largest annual watch fair, which takes place in the first week of April. Pin also said a new version of TAG Heuer\u2019s Connected luxury smartwatch would be released later this year and that the company would be looking to leverage its historic timekeeping technology in the future.\n\nWhile the industry has been moving to a low-volume, high-value model, Pin said he was ambitious to increase his company\u2019s volumes, contradicting the current industry trend. FHS figures show that last year, export volumes plummeted by almost 10 percent and that Switzerland now exports half as many watches as in 2011. Meanwhile, average export values have more than doubled over the past decade.\n\n\u201cIf you give up and say it\u2019s just going to be super expensive products, you\u2019re battling for very few people,\u201d said Pin. \u201cWe need to have everybody on board with this, all stakeholders. But it won\u2019t be easy. Everything is leading toward quite high underlying inflation.\u201d A strong Swiss franc and the rising price of gold have been a constant headache for Swiss watchmakers.\n\nPin will be hoping the F1 partnership is the fuel that revs up his business. \u201cThere is a matter of pride that we\u2019re back in Formula 1,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that we are home.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion.

Both were aspiring property moguls at the time.\n\nLater that decade, Arnault shifted his focus to luxury brands, purchasing Christian Dior and beginning his acquisition of LVMH. He also invested in real estate, including properties on Fifth Avenue, close to Trump Tower.\n\nIn the weeks before Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017, Arnault was identified as one of the first business leaders to travel to the US to pay homage. His son, Alexandre Arnault, who had known Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner for years, joined him.\n\nThere are no signs that this partnership has weakened in recent years; in fact, it seems to have only grown stronger.\n\n\u201cThe day after President Trump survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania last summer, he received a call from a familiar French voice. It was Bernard Arnault, owner of the globe-spanning luxury empire LVMH,\u201d writes Nick Kostov.\n\n\u201cArnault wanted to check in on the man he had known for decades. Trump was also in the middle of a fierce presidential campaign, as well as several criminal proceedings.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe phone call from Arnault sent a clear signal: The luxury titan was sticking with Trump through thick and thin.\u201d\n\nThis political support was again emphasised during Trump\u2019s second inauguration in January, when Arnault appeared at the Capitol Rotunda alongside his wife, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mercier-Arnault, and two of his five children, Alexandre and Delphine.\n\n\u201cWho would refuse an invitation from the president of the United States to attend their inauguration?\u201d Besides, I\u2019ve had a longstanding relationship with him,\u201d Arnault said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The phone call from Arnault sent a clear signal: The luxury titan was sticking with Trump through thick and thin.\" Nick Kostov, The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe connection between the children of the unlikely pair continues with daughter Ivanka Trump, who is close with Arnault\u2019s daughter, Delphine, and a major supporter of the Dior brand.\n\nThe report reveals that when LVMH purchased Tiffany & Co. in 2021 in a landmark billion-dollar deal, Arnault personally informed Trump of a major upcoming deal beforehand.\n\nAmong the other interesting observations, the Trump Organisation is the landlord of the Louis Vuitton store in Midtown Manhattan. Trump\u2019s well-known \u2018air rights\u2019 agreement above the Tiffany & Co. flagship store is also highlighted.\n\nThe current president was reportedly so pleased with the deal that he named his daughter Tiffany after the brand \u2014 which Arnault now owns!\n\nTension & Tariffs & Tiffany\n\nThe report also details the significance of Trump\u2019s proposed steep tariffs on European luxury products, which could negatively impact LVMH.\n\nIt\u2019s suggested that Arnault has worked to leverage his personal relationship with Trump to protect LVMH from trade wars. This involves LVMH\u2019s significant investment in the US, with a Louis Vuitton factory in Texas being one of 14 factories.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s evident that we\u2019re being strongly encouraged by US authorities to continue expanding our presence there. And I must say that, given the current environment, this is something we are seriously considering,\u201d Arnault explained in January.\n\nBackground reading: TIMELINE: Inside the Tiffany & Co. and LVMH merger\n\nIn 2019, Trump imposed tariffs on European goods; however, he spared luxury items such as champagne and handbags due to Arnault\u2019s investment in US production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can\u2019t tax him [Arnault] because he moved to the United States. He was very smart. He was way ahead.\" Donald Trump, US President\n\nWhen French media asked Trump why the tariffs were so selective, he conceded he had been discussing the issue with Arnault.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tax him [Arnault] because he moved to the United States. He was very smart. He was way ahead,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe report speculates that future tariffs may be determined in part by the relationship between the two unlikely friends.\n\n\u201cWith Trump now in office and warning of steep tariffs on European goods, the question is whether Arnault can leverage his connection to keep his luxury conglomerate out of any trade wars,\u201d Kostov continues.\n\n\u201cTariffs would be a blow to Arnault\u2019s empire, whose largest market is the US \u2014 equal in size to all of Europe combined. Trump has called the European Union\u2019s trade surplus with the US an \u2018atrocity\u2019, but he also often leans on personal relationships to guide his policy.\u201d\n\nLVMH recently reported a group revenue decline of 2 per cent over the past financial year, reaching \u20ac84.68 billion ($AUD141.73 billion).\n\nMore reading\n\nDonald Trump's lab-created diamond lookalike\n\nElection fever: Trump showcases line of luxury watches\n\nBest is yet to come for LVMH despite sales dip\n\nLVMH under fire as Olympic Games controversy emerges\n\nLVMH CEO denies knowledge of illegal surveillance\n\nGlobal uncertainty impacts revenue for LVMH\n\n10 years: LVMH and Formula 1 agree to massive deal",

Among the biggest names in this industry is Bernard Arnault, the French businessman whose success in luxury goods has made him one of the richest people in the world.\n\nAs of September 2024, Arnault boasts a staggering net worth of $199.7 billion (\u00a3158 billion), making him the third richest person globally, behind only Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. He is the founder, chairman, and CEO of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (LVMH), the largest luxury goods company in the world.\n\nLVMH owns prestigious brands such as Christian Dior, Celine, Tiffany, Sephora, Louis Vuitton, and Mo\u00ebt Hennessy. The company has also expanded into luxury hospitality, owning Cheval Blanc Maisons, Bvlgari Hotels, and the Belmond group. With hotel properties in 24 countries, Arnault is considered the world's richest hotelier, according to Insider Monkey.\n\nArnault\u2019s journey in the luxury sector began in 1984 when he acquired the struggling textile and retail conglomerate Boussac Saint-Fr\u00e8res, which owned Dior. His aggressive business strategy, which involved revitalising Dior and selling off non-essential assets, earned him the nickname \"The Terminator.\" Over the years, he expanded LVMH into a powerhouse covering fashion, jewellery, watches, wine, and hospitality. Today, LVMH is the largest company by market value in the eurozone.\n\nOne of LVMH\u2019s flagship hotels is Cheval Blanc Paris, located along the Seine. This ultra-luxurious property features 72 rooms, with rates starting at 1,900 euros (\u00a31,573) per night in the low season. The hotel offers breathtaking views of Paris, along with premium amenities such as a spa, swimming pools, and wellness centres.\n\nArnault\u2019s family is also deeply involved in his empire. His children hold executive roles in the luxury goods sector, with Delphine and Antoine serving as chair and vice-chairperson of Christian Dior Couture, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric leading LVMH Watches.\n\nWhile Arnault has previously held the title of the world\u2019s richest person, his wealth fluctuates due to market changes. He briefly surpassed Bezos in 2019 and 2020 and even overtook Elon Musk in April 2023 before Musk reclaimed the top spot in June that year.",

Rider, who will start his new job early next year, worked alongside former Celine designer Phoebe Philo at Celine for over a decade.\n\nSlimane\u2019s departure will intensify speculation about upheaval in the industry, where a number of top designers have moved jobs. One of the most coveted roles, creative director of Chanel, remains unfilled after the departure of Virginie Viard in June.\n\nCreative directors most often depart when they no longer have a positive impact on sales, said Luca Solca, an analyst with Bernstein.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is an exception,\u201d he said of Slimane\u2019s exit, noting that, like artists, creative directors tend to produce variations on a theme, which can become predictable.\n\nSolca said Slimane had done well at the label, likely more than doubling brand revenue to around \u20ac2.5 billion ($2.76 billion).\n\nSlimane could not be reached for comment.\n\nSlimane joined Celine in 2018, quickly making his mark at the historic fashion house with his distinctive rocker-chic aesthetic.\n\nHe is also known for the skinny silhouettes that he offered when he was at Dior Homme and at Kering\u2019s Yves Saint Laurent, famously inspiring Karl Lagerfeld to slim down to fit into his Dior designs.\n\nThe designer rarely granted interviews and maintained tight control of all aspects of brand image, shooting advertising images himself and holding fashion shows outside of the traditional calendar.\n\nAt Celine, Slimane sought to update the brand\u2019s French bourgeois aesthetic for a younger audience, with ad campaigns featuring model Kaia Gerber in cropped tops and faded jeans, accessorised with a baseball cap and small, leather purse.\n\nHe also introduced a menswear line at Celine, as well as fragrances and makeup.\n\nLVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault set ambitious targets for Slimane, telling investors shortly after he joined that LVMH aimed to grow annual revenue at Celine to between \u20ac2 billion to 3 billion within five years, from close to \u20ac1 billion ($1.10 billion) at the time.\n\nIn January, at LVMH\u2019s annual results presentation, Arnault said that Celine was enjoying \u201cgreat success\u201d thanks to Slimane, and topping \u20ac2 billion in sales.\n\nThe company does not break down revenue by brand in its published earnings statements.\n\nGrowth in sales in the luxury goods industry in general has slowed sharply this year, as middle-class shoppers in China hold off on purchases due to the property slump and job insecurity.\n\nBarclays analyst Carole Madjo noted during a recent trip to China that Celine was facing \u201cbrand fatigue\u201d and was likely to be underperforming in the country.\n\nThe change follows other moves at LVMH, including its investment in one of the industry\u2019s strongest performers in recent years, Moncler.\n\nIt said this week it had sold off streetwear label Off-White, founded by the late Louis Vuitton menswear designer Virgil Abloh.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

According to sources close to the matter, the Milanese fashion house has commissioned financial advisors to assess the viability of such an operation, although no formal offer has yet been submitted.\n\nA repatriation opportunity for Versace\n\nShould this takeover be successful, Versace would return to Italian ownership after being acquired by Capri Holdings in 2018. This move would be part of a consolidation trend in the luxury goods market, dominated by French giants LVMH and Kering, who have stepped up their acquisitions in Italy in recent years.\n\nLVMH already owns Fendi, Loro Piana and recently invested in Moncler and Stone Island, while Kering controls Gucci, Bottega Veneta and has an option on Valentino. Faced with these behemoths, Prada is seeking to strengthen its brand portfolio and secure its position in a changing market.\n\nPrada: an aggressive strategy despite the slowdown in the luxury goods sector\n\nAt a time when the luxury goods sector is experiencing a slowdown, Prada is holding its own thanks to the growing success of its Miu Miu brand, which is very popular with young consumers. The Hong Kong-listed company is enjoying solid growth, which could enable it to absorb a major player like Versace.\n\nMeanwhile, Capri Holdings is going through a phase of uncertainty following the failure of its merger with Tapestry, which would have created an American-style luxury giant. The group has mandated Barclays to explore various strategic options, including the sale of some of its brands.\n\nA case to keep an eye on\n\nAccording to The Platform, Prada has secured an exclusive agreement to carry out an in-depth investigation of Versace. If this acquisition goes ahead, it would redefine the balance of luxury goods in Italy, consolidating Prada as a key player in the face of French groups.

            "content": "When Fenty Beauty by Rihanna launched in 2017, its debut foundation range spanning 40 shades pushed inclusivity to the forefront of the beauty conversation.\n\n\u201cIt felt like every makeup brand went into a panic,\u201d says Shirley Ibe, a Calgary-based makeup artist and the founder of Madeup Beauty. \u201cFenty challenged the industry and pushed boundaries.\u201d\n\nThe Barbadian singer had jumpstarted the \u201cFenty effect.\u201d\n\nRihanna\u2019s launch, in partnership with French luxury company LVMH, caused a stir for several reasons, including selling US$100-million in products in its first month. But also because so many shades were offered all at once, and because the collection was balanced with substantial options for every skin tone from fair to deep. Another detail: The darker shades were quick to sell out.\n\nThis revelation ran in opposition to the boiler-plate statement that Toronto-based beauty expert Tracy Peart had heard many times since starting out at makeup counters in the early 2000s. \u201cI was told \u2018it wouldn\u2019t sell\u2019 more than once,\u201d she says, of her inquiries about extended shades over the years. \u201cThen I started to see other makeup brands slowly getting the point,\u201d recalls Peart. \u201cFenty is not a Black-only line. It\u2019s for everybody and it sells.\u201d\n\nNow, nearly a decade later, cosmetic consumers with medium to deep skin tones have more options from mass and indie brands alike. \u201cI will give a round of applause for the progress, it\u2019s been significant, but I don\u2019t want to pretend we\u2019re where we need to be and we\u2019re done now,\u201d says Peart.\n\nThe fact remains that Black and brown complexions are still underserved by many brands that claim to be inclusive. \u201cFormulating makeup for deeper skin tones is not fundamentally different from formulating for lighter skin tones,\u201d says Julie Sinitambirivoutin, a cosmetic chemist in Montreal. \u201cHowever, one of the biggest challenges is accurately identifying the vast spectrum of undertones present in darker skin.\u201d\n\nShe notes that the colour-matching process should also involve extensive testing with a diverse panel of individuals. \u201cUnfortunately, not all companies prioritize this level of testing, which can result in shade ranges that fail to truly cater to deeper skin tones.\u201d\n\nAs recently documented by Golloria George, a social-media content creator of South Sudanese heritage, lines with decades of formulation expertise such as Anastasia Beverly Hills and Too Faced are still missing the mark. \u201cInclusivity should not be treated as a marketing trend or a selling point; it must be a fundamental industry standard,\u201d Sinitambirivoutin says.\n\nIn a 2022 report on Black representation in the beauty industry, business magazine McKinsey Quarterly found that \u201cfrom entry-level to the C-suite, and from retailers to beauty houses, only four to five per cent of employees in the U.S. beauty industry are Black.\u201d\n\nThe report also noted that addressing racial equity in the beauty industry is a US$2.6-billion opportunity and that \u201cbetter serving Black consumers and supporting Black beauty brands could lead to greater equity across the industry.\u201d\n\nInclusion also needs to be a through line into the consumer experience where the complete collection is available for all in stores, rather than select shades only online. \u201cI still remember that feeling as a teenager, when all you want to do is fit in and shop like your friends. It just doesn\u2019t feel good to be relegated to very few options, or not to have the option at all,\u201d says Peart. \u201cIt\u2019s not just like some cheesy clich\u00e9: Inclusion matters, it really does.\u201d\n\nSix buys to try\n\nThese Black-owned brands are making shades that are a flawless match for medium to deep complexions.\n\nFrom a Montreal-based line, versatility rules this cream-based stick available in nine shades. It can be used as complexion coverage, or to contour or highlight the face. Nagi Cosmetics Multipurpose Beauty Stick.\n\nBuy\n\nFifty: the number of undertone-specific shades available in a long-wear liquid concealer that offers buildable and crease-proof coverage to brighten dark under eyes, cover blemishes and even out discolouration.

Europe \u2013 according to the latest edition of the hugely influential Bank of America fund manager survey.\n\nMore than a third of the respondents \u2013 the professionals who together take care of $482billion worth of global savings \u2013 say European shares are undervalued against their global peers.\n\nIf your portfolio is concentrated in US tech stocks, then a taste of Europe may be what you need.\n\nThis can be found among the Granolas, a group of 11 European multinationals, selected by US bank Goldman Sachs, which is made up of GSK (also known as GlaxoSmithKline), Roche, ASML, Nestle, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, L'Oreal, LVMH, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.\n\nYes, the name actually spells out 'Grannnllass'.\n\nTwo are British \u2013 AstraZeneca and GSK. But all are global leaders in sectors like luxury, pharmaceuticals, beauty and software, and deserving of a place in your portfolio.\n\nSunnier outlook?: For the past two years, European markets have been overshadowed by the stellar feats of the 'Magnificent Seven' US tech stocks\n\nThis may not seem an ideal moment to bet on Europe: the world order is shifting, and the continent is being rocked by the pace of change. But there are signs of revival and resolve to deliver long-overdue reform.\n\nGermany goes to the polls tomorrow, as gloom over its economy gathers. But there are hopes the election could produce a conservative-led coalition which would cut corporate taxes and bolster growth.\n\nMarcel Stotzel, manager of the Fidelity European fund, says some of the enthusiasm for Europe arises from the view that there is a widening disconnect between the prices of some US stocks and their fundamental value.\n\nBut there are other reasons. Stotzel explains: 'There has been a deep sigh of relief over the introduction of tariffs by President Trump. It seems as if they are going to affect Canada, China and Mexico more than the EU.'\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek, a cheap Chinese artificial intelligence system, may have rocked the share prices of the US tech titans who have spent billions on the more expensive ChatGPT.\n\nBut Stotzel argues that DeepSeek is good news for European firms because they must deploy AI and may now do so for far less.\n\nThe heightened geopolitical tensions with the US over Ukraine are one of the forces compelling investors to look at Europe.\n\nStotzel says European companies, such as the French industrial group LeGrand, are set to play major role in rebuilding Ukraine. This is why analysts think its shares could jump from \u20ac110.30 to as much as \u20ac126.\n\nMeanwhile, European defence and aerospace stocks have soared this week in response to US calls for EU states to increase their military spending.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, has promised that such expenditure would be exempted from the normal limits on states' budgets. Among the beneficiaries of her announcement have been shares in firms usually overlooked by UK investors such as Italian defence aerospace group Leonardo.\n\nThere have also been gains of 14 per cent to 25 per cent among the German giants such as Thyssenkrupp, the engineering and steel manufacturer. The price of Rheinmetall, a specialist in ammunition, drones and tanks, has soared by 30 per cent.\n\nAnalysts still rate Rheinmetall a 'buy', although the increase since the start of the year could tempt some investors to take profits.\n\nIf you are contemplating exploring Europe, this is why investors fell out of love with this region \u2013 and why it may be worth your attention now.\n\nWhy did Europe lose its bite?\n\nFor the past two years, European markets have been overshadowed by the stellar feats of the 'Magnificent Seven' US tech stocks \u2013 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.\n\nThe gains made from these shares have reinforced the adage that 'the US innovates, the EU regulates'. The belief that a bureaucratic Europe was being badly left behind in an era of American exceptionalism was amplified by the Donald Trump's victory last November.\n\nThis sparked an exodus of investors in the final quarter. Europe's main stock market index, the Stoxx 600, ticked up by just 6 per cent in 2024, against 23 per cent for the US S&P 500 index .\n\nBut there are moves, driven by Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), and other officials to introduce reforms and relax the stranglehold of bureaucracy.\n\nHow big should your appetite be?\n\nThe members of the Granola gang are global players. They do not depend on their domestic economies, but they do get a boost from lower interest rates.\n\nThe ECB has cut interest rates five times since last June and could order three more reductions, if inflation eases.\n\nOne of the best ways to back the Granolas is through a fund or trust such as BlackRock Greater Europe, Fidelity European or Henderson European.\n\nBut Ben Yearsley of Fairview Investing says that there are currently some bargains among the Granolas.\n\nASML, a Dutch business, is the world's number one maker of the equipment required for the manufacture of microchips. Its shares have fallen 14 per cent over the past six months to \u20ac709.90, driven by the alarm over DeepSeek.\n\nThe view that DeepSeek could expand, rather than contract sales of ASML's kit explains why analysts rate the shares a 'buy'. The average target price is \u20ac842, although one analyst is forecasting a price of \u20ac1,057.\n\nNovo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical behemoth, is the maker of the anti-obesity drugs Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nNovo Nordisk shares are more than 300 per cent higher than ten years ago at 630 Danish krone, nearly \u00a364. In common with other analysts, the broker UBS rates shares a 'buy', with a target price of 750 krone.\n\nFundsmith and Stonehage Fleming Global Best Ideas are among the funds that hold LVMH, the Tiffany and Moet Hennessy luxury goods conglomerate led by Bernard Arnault, one of the world's richest men. Arnault, a member of Trump's billionaire mates gang, is considering 'bulking up' LVMH's production in America to exploit its 'dynamic market'.\n\nThere are predictions that the new era of more overt glamour ushered in by the Trump administration will be good for sales of LVMH's bags, scents and watches. The shares stand at \u20ac702.40 \u2013 and are worth holding, according to analysts.\n\nAre there other opportunities?\n\nIF you are looking for a thrill-packed European adventure, take a peek at the group also named for a breakfast cereal \u2013 Cheerios. They are: Coface, H Lundbeck, Evonik, Eramet, Repsol, Indra Sistemas, OTP Bank and SAF-Holland.\n\nThese lesser-known businesses operate in the fields of automobile parts, chemicals, insurance and oil and gas, but such smaller firms are difficult to research.\n\nIf you want a stake in the bounty that could flow from the lessening of regulation in Europe and the new confidence that its markets can compete with the US, the European Smaller Companies represents a route. Its managers have a special mission to find bargains.",

With Aupen's bag swinging from half of Hollywood's shoulders, seemingly overnight, the Singapore label was just as quickly propelled into the spotlight.\n\nTurns out, we weren't the only ones who spied the new brand on the block. Add in the fact Hailey Bieber and Kylie Jenner are also known Aupen fans, and it wasn't long before every bag sold out, with the brand's site shutting down shortly after.\n\nFast forward six months and as swiftly as it disappeared, Aupen returned in November of last year with a full re-stock of its hero arm candy, the Nirvana. The same bag that captured the attention of the A-list (and everyone else, tbh) in the first place. Already this year, it's been carried by Anya Taylor-Joy and Jenna Ortega.\n\nThe restock is the result of a new partnership between the brand and LVMH M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art, a prestigious leader in the production of luxury goods whose entities work with some of the biggest designer brands in the world including Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Schiaparelli. Excitingly, as well as relaunching its bags (now crafted in genuine leather versus the vegan leather of the original Aupen designs), Aupen has dropped its , the first of its new jewellery collection made in partnership with LVMH.\n\nAUPEN\n\nAupen first expanded into jewellery in early 2024, with Dakota Johnson and Emma Stone spotted wearing pieces from the debut collection. Now, due to popular demand, Aupen has reimagined the product category entirely, and the Sinner Earrings seem a fitting first release. Featuring an S-curve design and handcrafted using gold-tone metal with crystals, they're a statement design made for date night dressing.\n\n\u201cWe saw huge success with our first jewellery collection, so are excited to be re-entering the category bigger and better through the support of the talented artisans and craftsmen from LVMH M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art\u2019s world-renowned supply chain,\u201d says brand founder, Nicholas Tan. \u201cTo us, this launch marks the beginning of a new era for Aupen.\u201d\n\nJon Kopaloff // Getty Images NBC // Getty Images\n\nThere's no denying the affordable price point was a big reason behind the immense popularity of Aupen's bags. For fans hoping for much of the same from the brand's new jewellery line, no luck this time (sob). The Sinner Earrings are, admittedly, a more expensive offering, retailing for \u00a3655. Though Tan is quick to justify this.\n\n\u201cThere is a corresponding reason why we price something, that\u2019s the basis behind which Aupen operates,\u201d he explains. From the intricate design of the Sinner earrings to the hefty craftsmanship credentials LVMH M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art promises, these earrings may be an investment buy, but they're something you'll be able to wear forever with no worry of irritated ear lobes, unsightly green tinging, or product tarnishing. \u201cAupen is about delivering the products that the girls can enjoy. It really warms my heart when people can actually use and access [our products]. That's when I feel that the brand has been successful.\u201d\n\nHaving had a sneak peek at what else is to come in the jewellery collection, Cosmopolitan UK can confirm it is indeed set to be bigger and better than before \u2013 and just as iconic as Aupen's iconic asymmetrical handbags.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still in awe of the incredible journey our brand has experienced since our founding in November 2022. In just two short years, we\u2019ve grown in ways we couldn\u2019t have imagined,\u201d Tan says, reflecting on the small operation he initially launched, run out of his grandmother's home, the two of them managing stock. \u201cThis drop feels like both a celebration of that growth and an exciting step into our next chapter.\u201d\n\nFollow Alex on Instagram.\n\n\n\n",

Design serves a practical function while works of applied art require a discernible level of individual artistic creativity.\n\nShoemaker and Birkenstock dynasty member Karl Birkenstock, born in 1936, is alive. However, since he crafted his initial designs in the 1970s, some sandals no longer enjoy design protection.\n\nAs a result lawyers asked the court to classify the shoes as art.\n\nKonstantin Wegner, Birkenstock\u2019s lawyer, said the sandals had an \u201ciconic design\u201d and announced further litigation after the decision was announced. \u201cWe want to add arguments in these pending proceedings,\u201d said Wegner without elaborating.\n\nOnce popular with hippies, tech enthusiasts and medical professionals, Birkenstock gained widespread attention after Australian actress Margot Robbie wore a pair of pink Birkenstocks in the final scene of the 2023 hit movie \u201cBarbie.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1774, Birkenstock was run by the namesake family for six generations until it sold a majority stake to L Catterton, a U.S. private equity firm backed by French billionaire Bernard Arnault and his luxury goods empire LVMH.\n\nL Catterton remained Birkenstock\u2019s biggest shareholder after the company went public in 2023.\n\n(Reporting by Ursula Knapp, writing by Thomas Seythal; Editing by Sharon Singleton)",

It merges things in a very flat way, and it creates these kinds of weird, deconstructed garments that don\u2019t work physically. So I looked at these glitches and fails, and then tried to find a construction method where I can kind of turn it into something physical, like functional, like the double-front garments,\u201d said Fagerstrom, adding that she likes to get technical and break the rules of construction.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe designer said she is keen to stay in London after graduation and focus on building her brand.\n\nPalmer had a lot of experience with products before landing a place at CSM. He was hired by Dover Street Market to produce collections for Gosha Rubchinskiy and later oversaw the product development of brands under the Dover Street Market Paris umbrella, such as Vaquera, Olly Shinder and ERL.\n\nHe was one of the very few who showed clothes that could be immediately sold on a shop floor, including an oversize duffle coat, a check shirt and a trenchcoat.\n\nIt was a fun collection, too. \u201cI took the tongue-in-cheek attitude of lad culture, subverting it through funny fabrics, like the tea towels, and the teacup hats. I use humor a lot also. I drew parallels between adolescence and adulthood, and I looked at the wedgie and how kids assert dominance through stuff like that. I\u2019m trying to make a more playful, carefree type of guy.

It\u2019s very difficult to be positive and create, but creativity makes you positive by default because that\u2019s the most positive thing you can do.

Squint your eyes and notice the never-before-seen \u201cAUTOMATIC\u201d text on the dial before marvelling at the brilliant bit of engineering glistening through the exhibition case back. Yes, it is Bvlgari\u2019s brand new in-house automatic movement, the BVS100 Lady Solotempo Automatic. This bit of news can either excite or bore you, and if you are part of the former, read on to find out more. No judgement if you are in the latter camp; the key takeaway is that Bvlgari is serious, very serious, about one of its key women\u2019s collections.\n\nOfficial statements from Bvlgari noted that the manufacture took three years of development to finally put out the Lady Solotempo Automatic movement. Given Bvlgari\u2019s feat in ultra-thin watchmaking evident in its high jewellery counterpart, the Piccolissimo Calibre BVL 100, this iteration\u2019s release feels a tad bit protracted. But as they say, \u201cIt\u2019s better late than never.\u201d As its Solotempo namesake suggests, the time-only calibre displays the hours, minutes and seconds. It is a small movement, measuring 19mm across and 3.9mm thick and weighing five grams, designed to fit Bvlgari\u2019s svelte and dainty range of Serpenti watches. For comparison\u2019s sake, the manual winding BVL 100 is 12mm wide, 2.5mm thick and weighs a feather-light 1.3 grams while providing 30 hours of power reserve. On the flip side, the BVS100 delivers an impressive 50-hour power reserve in line with movements that are easily double its size.\n\nBefore touching on the watches, there is one final crucial bit of information worth pointing out \u2014 the BVS100 movement will be shared with other maisons within the LVMH Group. The press release states, \u201cThe BVS100 ladies\u2019 movement, developed and currently produced by Bvlgari in Le Sentier, is expected to be included in the future catalogue of in-house movements available to other LVMH group Maisons and to be manufactured by Zenith in its Movement Manufacture. Bvlgari is proud to contribute to the manufacturing ecosystem established by LVMH in support of Watchmaking excellence and craftsmanship in Switzerland.\u201d\n\nNine references across two families are amongst Bvlgari\u2019s initial offerings that are housing the BVS100 movement, with the majority (seven) skewed towards the Bvlgari Serpenti Seduttori Automatic. The lineup includes twp stainless steel, two-tone stainless steel and rose gold, and a full yellow or rose gold piece, all adorned with a diamond bezel. Two other high jewellery pieces are available as well, clad in white or yellow gold and fully encrusted with 273 round brilliant cut diamonds totalling 2.4 carats across its dial, case and hexagonal-scale bracelet. The remaining two references are part of the Bvlgari Serpenti Tubogas Automatic lineup featuring a rose gold case and either a single or double-loop bracelet.\n\nOnce you are done with this story, click here to catch up with our February 2025 issue.",

They rose 4.1 percent year-on-year to 1.9 billion Swiss francs, or $2.1 billion at current exchange rates.\n\nThe U.S. continued to lead, with the top market for Swiss timepieces growing 16.2 percent.\n\nThe polarization of the market continued to be visible in figures by price segment, with the luxury segment showing stronger recovery.\n\n\u201cPrice rises, the U.S. and lowest and most expensive watches drive strong exports,\u201d Jefferies analyst James Grzinic wrote in a trading note. \u201cThis is driven by major price rises in both the cheapest and the more expensive timepieces, as well as a strong inventory rebuild in the US.\u201d\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nSales in mainland China \u201cremain very weak,\u201d he added.\n\nThe downward turn in demand for Swiss timepieces in Greater China continued as the mainland and Hong Kong showed declines of 29.1 percent and 11.7 percent respectively.\n\nJapan was a bright spot in Asia, with sales up 26.2 percent in the island nation, as the weak yen has hit a low against the dollar, spurring on high profits for the country\u2019s car exports and sending the stock market soaring.\n\nDemonstrating the bifurcation of the market, watches at both the high and low end saw growth, while the middle lost ground.\n\nWatches under 200 Swiss francs at export price grew in value by 0.7 percent, although the industry body noted that they \u201cremained at a level close to their 2024 performance.\u201d\n\nThe mid-range continued to decline in volume and value by high-single digits.\n\nHigh-end timepieces, priced over 3,000 Swiss francs at export price, grew 7 percent in value and by 0.6 percent in volume.\n\nBut this may not signal the end of luxury woes as a mixed picture emerged from the breakdown by materials.\n\nWhile precious-metal watches and gold-and-steel models grew 9.7 and 8.9 percent in value respectively, their volumes contracted by 3.6 and 1.5 percent. Meanwhile, steel watches continue to lose ground in volume, dipping 2.4 percent, while the number of units leaving the country rose by 5 percent.\n\nPrice growth at the high end comes as precious metals have skyrocketed.\n\nGold prices hit their all-time high at the end of January at $2,798 per troy ounce, up 7 percent and surpassing its previous high in October 2024. Traders have been stockpiling gold, with commodity traders in the U.S. increasing inventory 75 percent since the U.S. election in November, causing shortages in other markets.\n\nOther metals including silver and platinum have also seen prices rise, around 2.5 percent each.\n\nBranded timepieces and hard luxury continued to generate strong interest from consumers, continuing a pattern of consumers seeking marque names. Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels were two brands that continued to do well with consumers, Grzinic noted.",

In 2019, South Africa\u2019s Thebe Magugu became the first African designer to take home the grand prize. Priya Ahluwalia, a British Indian Nigerian designer, was a finalist in 2020, and Lukhanyo Mdingi from Cape Town won the Special Prize in 2021.\n\nThe LVMH Prize is a major platform for young designers, offering \u20ac400,000 to the winner along with a year of mentorship in key areas like sustainable practices, marketing, and brand management.

With the competition becoming more competitive, we\u2019re particularly thrilled about these four African designers who have made it this far.\n\nMeet them below:\n\nDavid Kusi Boye-Doe \u201cBoyedoe\u201d (Ghana)\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Boye-Doe, Boyedoe is the first Ghanaian brand to participate in the LVMH Prize. David Boye-Doe combines Afrofuturism with traditional West African tailoring, creating bold, genderless designs with structured silhouettes. The brand is committed to sustainability, focusing on deconstruction and reconstruction in its designs. Drawing inspiration from the Sankofa bird, a symbol in Ghanaian culture, Boyedoe uses fashion to explore and reimagine African heritage in a socially and environmentally responsible way.\n\nSince its international debut as a finalist for ARISE 30 Under 30 New Stars in Lagos, Boyedoe has launched four collections, including his most recent at the Lagos Fashion Weekend in October last year.\n\nTolu Coker (Nigeria)\n\nTolu Coker, a British-Nigerian designer, is reshaping womenswear by placing identity and heritage at the heart of her designs. Her collections explore themes of migration, race, and cultural storytelling, often incorporating hand-dyed fabrics and up-cycled materials. As a passionate advocate for sustainable fashion, she founded her brand in 2021 with the aim of redefining luxury through sustainability, inclusivity, and cultural preservation.\n\nDrawing on her own heritage and a family legacy of social activism, Tolu Coker\u2019s work blends quality tailoring, craftsmanship, and cultural narratives. She combines traditional techniques like batik, loom weaving, and hand-embroidery with modern technologies, creating collections that connect the past with the future. Her bold approach has caught the attention of stars like Tems and Doechii, who have worn her creations. Beyond fashion, her brand also extends into exhibitions, films, and global projects, challenging industry standards and using luxury as a platform for equity, heritage, and social impact\n\nTorisheju Dumi (Nigeria)\n\nTorisheju Dumi, the designer behind the UK-based brand Torisheju, launched her label with the goal of pushing the limits of contemporary fashion.\n\nHer collections combine menswear and womenswear, featuring sculptural, artistic designs, architectural structures, fluid draping, and avant-garde aesthetic. Torisheju gained attention after dressing Zendaya for the \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d photocall, which brought her work into the spotlight.\n\nGrowing up, Torisheju was exposed to fashion through her mother\u2019s passion for 19th-century design and art. Her Nigerian-Brazilian, Catholic upbringing also influences her work, with themes of religion, tradition, and spirituality playing a central role. Torisheju graduated with an MA in Fashion from Central Saint Martins and is an alumna of the Sarabande Foundation. She has also gained invaluable experience at C\u00e9line with Phoebe Philo, as well as at Ann Demeulemeester, Giles Deacon, and Sibling London.\n\nYasmin Mansour (Egypt)\n\nYasmin Mansour founded her eponymous brand in 2014 with a focus on creating a dialogue between sculptural elegance and artistic expression. Based in Qatar, her label is known for architectural silhouettes, intricate pleating, and a reverence for traditional craftsmanship.\n\nHer designs combine texture and structure to present a refined approach to luxury, where fashion meets contemporary art. Every creation embodies a thoughtful balance of innovation and artistry, making Yasmin Mansour\u2019s work a celebration of both craft and creativity.",

In 2019, South Africa\u2019s Thebe Magugu became the first African designer to take home the grand prize. Priya Ahluwalia, a British Indian Nigerian designer, was a finalist in 2020, and Lukhanyo Mdingi from Cape Town won the Special Prize in 2021.\n\nThe LVMH Prize is a major platform for young designers, offering \u20ac400,000 to the winner along with a year of mentorship in key areas like sustainable practices, marketing, and brand management. There are also two other awards\u2014the Karl Lagerfeld Prize and the Savoir-Faire Prize, each with \u20ac200,000 and a year of mentorship.\n\nThe 20 semi-finalists will showcase their collections during Paris Fashion Week on March 5th and 6th. With the competition becoming more competitive, we\u2019re particularly thrilled about these four African designers who have made it this far.\n\nMeet them below:\n\nDavid Kusi Boye-Doe \u201cBoyedoe\u201d (Ghana)\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Boye-Doe, Boyedoe is the first Ghanaian brand to participate in the LVMH Prize. David Boye-Doe combines Afrofuturism with traditional West African tailoring, creating bold, genderless designs with structured silhouettes. The brand is committed to sustainability, focusing on deconstruction and reconstruction in its designs. Drawing inspiration from the Sankofa bird, a symbol in Ghanaian culture, Boyedoe uses fashion to explore and reimagine African heritage in a socially and environmentally responsible way.\n\nSince its international debut as a finalist for ARISE 30 Under 30 New Stars in Lagos, Boyedoe has launched four collections, including his most recent at the Lagos Fashion Weekend in October last year.\n\nTolu Coker (Nigeria)\n\nTolu Coker, a British-Nigerian designer, is reshaping womenswear by placing identity and heritage at the heart of her designs. Her collections explore themes of migration, race, and cultural storytelling, often incorporating hand-dyed fabrics and up-cycled materials. As a passionate advocate for sustainable fashion, she founded her brand in 2021 with the aim of redefining luxury through sustainability, inclusivity, and cultural preservation.\n\nDrawing on her own heritage and a family legacy of social activism, Tolu Coker\u2019s work blends quality tailoring, craftsmanship, and cultural narratives. She combines traditional techniques like batik, loom weaving, and hand-embroidery with modern technologies, creating collections that connect the past with the future. Her bold approach has caught the attention of stars like Tems and Doechii, who have worn her creations. Beyond fashion, her brand also extends into exhibitions, films, and global projects, challenging industry standards and using luxury as a platform for equity, heritage, and social impact\n\nTorisheju Dumi (Nigeria)\n\nTorisheju Dumi, the designer behind the UK-based brand Torisheju, launched her label with the goal of pushing the limits of contemporary fashion.\n\nHer collections combine menswear and womenswear, featuring sculptural, artistic designs, architectural structures, fluid draping, and avant-garde aesthetic. Torisheju gained attention after dressing Zendaya for the \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d photocall, which brought her work into the spotlight.\n\nGrowing up, Torisheju was exposed to fashion through her mother\u2019s passion for 19th-century design and art. Her Nigerian-Brazilian, Catholic upbringing also influences her work, with themes of religion, tradition, and spirituality playing a central role. Torisheju graduated with an MA in Fashion from Central Saint Martins and is an alumna of the Sarabande Foundation. She has also gained invaluable experience at C\u00e9line with Phoebe Philo, as well as at Ann Demeulemeester, Giles Deacon, and Sibling London.\n\nYasmin Mansour (Egypt)\n\nYasmin Mansour founded her eponymous brand in 2014 with a focus on creating a dialogue between sculptural elegance and artistic expression. Based in Qatar, her label is known for architectural silhouettes, intricate pleating, and a reverence for traditional craftsmanship.\n\nHer designs combine texture and structure to present a refined approach to luxury, where fashion meets contemporary art. Every creation embodies a thoughtful balance of innovation and artistry, making Yasmin Mansour\u2019s work a celebration of both craft and creativity.",

Not long afterward, the company announced that it had parted ways with CEO Marco Gobetti, who\u2019d joined in 2022.\n\nLike most luxury brands, Ferragamo has not been immune to the headwinds of the Chinese economy.

One of the advantages is that the family that controls the company can maintain a coherence behind the brand, and that\u2019s very important. You can still be coherent when you\u2019re part of a big group, but this element of consistency is a key [advantage] of independent brands. You can make choices outside the box and be more original as an independent brand , and you have more advantages long-term. In a case like Ferragamo, we have founding values and principles that make the difference.\n\nThere are also disadvantages. It\u2019s a challenge to stay independent and stay competitive, especially when it comes to sourcing and the retail network, but we are very determined and do it.",

The estate became particularly famous for its single vineyard wines, such as its Cabernet Sauvignon expressions.\n\nDisaster struck in September 2020 with the outbreak of the Glass Fire which swept across Northern California. Newton Vineyard was one of a number of Napa producers to be affected by the inferno, losing a large area of vineyard and its winery building \u2013 some reports suggested that just 2ha of vines survived the fire. It did not produce a 2020 harvest, and the majority of the 2019 vintage, ageing in barrels, was also lost.\n\nAt the time, then-general manager Jean-Baptiste Rivail told local news outlet North Bay Business Journal: \u201cWe are working full steam ahead with our insurance partners and county officials to clean and plan the rebuilding and redevelopment \u2014 all our energy is focused on preparing our future and moving onward and upward. We are determined to rebuild!\u201d\n\nAfter this point, Newton Vineyard\u2019s winemaking was undertaken in a temporary facility.\n\nWhen db\u2018s American contributor Roger Morris examined the issue of wildfires in California last year, he noted that LVMH had not made any mention of rebuilding the Newton Vineyard winery.\n\nIt has now emerged that the producer will permanently cease to operate.\n\nAn email to members of Newton Vineyard\u2019s wine club explained that the decision to close was \u201cprofoundly challenging\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely hope that everyone who has been touched by Newton Vineyard will continue to cherish the wines and memories we have created together,\u201d it continued. \u201cWe are deeply grateful for the unwavering support we have received over the years from our valued consumers and dedicated fans.\u201d\n\ndb has reached out to LVMH for comment on the closure.\n\nRelated news\n\nOntario liquor board denies tampering with Gretzky wine labels\n\nSenators fight to support smoke-affected vintners\n\n'Cabernet may be king but Merlot proved emperor'",

The 2025 edition is no exception. For its 12th year running, the prize drew 2,300 applicants from around the world, all competing for a coveted spot.\n\nNow, the competition has been whittled down to 20 semi-finalists from 15 countries. Stealing the spotlight? Three Arab designers, making waves and marking a significant moment for regional representation at fashion\u2019s highest level. Their presence underscores the Middle East\u2019s growing influence on the global stage\u2014no longer a spectator in high fashion but a driving force.\n\nOn March 5 and March 6, these rising talents will present their collections in Paris, where both the public and an expert panel will cast their votes. The LVMH Prize 2025 will grant three awards: the Young Fashion Designers winner will receive a 400,000-euro endowment and a year of mentorship; the Karl Lagerfeld Prize runner-up will be awarded 200,000 euros and a year of mentorship; and the Savoir-Faire Prize recipient will receive a 200,000-euro grant along with mentorship.\n\nMeet the Arab Finalists\n\nYasmin Mansour (Qatar)\n\nQatari designer Yasmin Mansour founded her eponymous brand in 2014, creating a conversation between sculptural elegance and artistic expression. Based in Qatar, her label is characterised by architectural silhouettes, intricate pleating, and a deep respect for traditional craftsmanship. Each piece is a tribute to artisanal excellence, reflecting her artistic vision, exceptional craftsmanship, and a commitment to sustainability.\n\nWith a thoughtful blend of texture and structure, Yasmin Mansour offers a refined take on luxury, merging fashion with contemporary art. Fresh off her win at the 2024 Fashion Trust Arabia Prize, Mansour continues to refine her signature aesthetic, which is both experimental and timeless. For her, fashion is more than just clothing\u2014it\u2019s about telling a story. Her designs exude a quiet sophistication, speaking to her unique ability to weave powerful narratives into each garment. Through her work, she aims to empower and celebrate femininity.\n\nKML (Saudi Arabia)\n\nFounded in 2022 by Ahmed and Razan Hassan, KML is a Saudi menswear brand that fuses research-driven design with a deep exploration of the evolution of human dress. KML\u2019s collections strike a balance between historical references and contemporary relevance, with Ahmed Hassan\u2019s razor-sharp tailoring defining the brand\u2019s understated yet opulent aesthetic. This unique approach redefines Saudi menswear on the global stage.\n\nKML\u2019s design philosophy is rooted in the belief that fashion should reflect humanity\u2019s ever-evolving identity. By looking into the history and transformation of clothing, KML creates meaningful, relevant designs that speak to our collective human story. Since its inception, Hassan\u2019s research-based approach has led to collections that showcase precision and personality, establishing KML as a standout force in the region.\n\nRenaissance Renaissance (Lebanon)\n\nCynthia Merhej, the creative force behind Renaissance Renaissance, infuses her rich sartorial heritage into an avant-garde brand that redefines femininity. Merhej seamlessly blends modern design elements with period-inspired details, creating collections that feature sharp, contemporary silhouettes softened by delicate touches. Her work challenges traditional notions of womanhood, engaging in a dialogue that connects historical influences with today\u2019s fashion trends in a way that is both intellectually engaging and effortlessly wearable.\n\nRenaissance Renaissance redefines occasion wear while honouring traditional craftsmanship. Entirely crafted in Beirut, the brand collaborates with local artisans and family-owned factories, ensuring a commitment to quality, sustainability, and social responsibility. By bridging eras, cultures, and identities, Merhej creates timeless garments that transcend fleeting trends. Her irreverent approach to femininity not only challenges established perceptions but also invites a deeper reflection on history, art, and the female body. A returning LVMH Prize contender since her shortlist appearance in 2021, Merhej\u2019s work stands as a testament to innovative design and the evolving narrative of modern womanhood.",

Boyedoe is rooted in sustainability, with culture, folklore and eclectic patterns underscoring its pieces and collections. The brand\u2019s pieces are made from discarded or unsold stock, upcycling them and finding inventive uses within the ethos of deconstruction and reconstruction.\n\nMansour, nominated for her eponymous brand , weaves texture and structure into her refined vision of luxury. Her brand\u2019s pieces are committed to a unique, sculptural elegance by melding architectural silhouettes, intricate pleating, and a reverence for traditional craftsmanship.

As part of a 10-year, multibrand deal between F1 and LVMH\u2014the world\u2019s largest luxury group\u2014watchmaker TAG Heuer will take over official timekeeping honors, and Louis Vuitton will debut as the race title sponsor.\n\nAfter a 25-year hiatus, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon\u2014also an LVMH property\u2014will return as F1\u2019s dedicated champagne provider, replacing the competing bubbly brands that recent winners have sprayed into the crowds. The winemaker has also unseated Rolex\u2019s naming rights to the Belgian Grand Prix in July.\n\nLVMH\u2019s brands\u2014like their luxury peers\u2014have long turned popular athletes into campaign ambassadors, lent their expertise to designing team uniforms, and courted wealthy fans through sponsorships. But the partnership\u2014reportedly worth more than $100 million a year\u2014is much more than a one-off publicity grab by a business more known for its fashion, jewelry, and beauty expertise. LVMH is becoming a serious sports power player.\n\nIts portfolio brands were everywhere in last summer\u2019s Olympics thanks to a \u20ac150 million investment: In the opening ceremony, Louis Vuitton monogrammed steamer trunks got prime placement, as performers like C\u00e9line Dion and Lady Gaga boated down the Seine in head-to-toe Dior. Team France competed in Berluti uniforms, and medals designed by jeweler Chaumet were presented on distinctive Vuitton-branded leather trays. (Its presence was so ubiquitous, some officials and fellow sponsors later complained to the media about the pervasiveness of the branding.)\n\nIn November, the Arnault family\u2014headed by LVMH founder, chairman, and CEO Bernard Arnault\u2014announced they had acquired a majority stake in Paris FC, a French second-tier soccer club. According to French media, the initial investment was valued at \u20ac100 to \u20ac200 million, and in the coming years, the Arnaults are expected to make a substantial push to both burnish the club\u2019s brand and elevate its performance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a luxury group take such broad strides across sport and sporting sponsorship,\u201d Hugo Hensley, head of sports services at the valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance, tells Front Office Sports.\n\nJon Durr/Imagn Images\n\nBrand awareness is a big part of this push, but the larger prize\u2014and an opportunity afforded only by sports\u2014is hooking the most valuable clients. Further, in wealth intelligence company Altrata\u2019s latest billionaire census, it found that sports indexed as the top hobby for 70% of men and 29% of women, ranking above pursuits like arts and education.\n\nHensley sees the LVMH deals as a natural fit for the brand, reaching different audiences and allowing the company to flex a variety of skills, from overhauling a merchandise collection to hosting events with top-spending clients.\n\n\u201cThere is a real camaraderie in sport that is very hard for luxury to find anywhere else,\u201d says Matteo Atti, a professor of luxury business at the International University of Monaco. \u201cIt tends to be so polished that you hardly ever go beyond the ads, and sport removes that layer of veneer and can bring people again face-to-face.\u201d\n\nLVMH is hardly the only luxury fashion player staking its claim on sports: In 2023, Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, who leads the conglomerate\u2019s biggest rival, Kering, acquired a majority stake in Creative Artists Agency, the entertainment and sports agency that reps many of the world\u2019s top athletes. He has also owned the French soccer team Stade Rennais FC since 1998. Chanel, meanwhile, signed a long-term deal last year to become title sponsor and timekeeping partner of The Boat Race, the much-watched rowing competition between Oxford and Cambridge universities.\n\nBut with LVMH\u2019s deep pockets and 75-brand portfolio, it\u2019s able to go much bigger.\n\nLVMH is pushing hard off the back of its successful premium sponsorship of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nIn October 2024, LVMH inked the F1 deal. The brand should see immediate impacts at the racetrack, among cars going 200 miles per hour. F1 is an obvious target for the luxury group, with its audience of global travelers and business leaders, including many ultra-wealthy fans who will jet to Miami or Monaco for a weekend to take in a race.\n\n\u201cI think Formula One retains that simplicity and immediacy that is incredible. But also, I think for luxury, specifically, it has now become so technical; it really showcases a level of know-how that is unbeatable,\u201d says Atti, who is also global chief marketing officer at private aviation company Vista, which, like LVMH, has made significant investments in motorsports, similarly attracted both by its international appeal and the opportunities to get up close and personal with clients. \u201cIt\u2019s the physical strength, the physical prowess, preparation, and alignment with the machinery\u2014all of that together, against the weather, against the conditions, and against all the odds.\u201d\n\nAndy Abeyta/Imagn Images\n\nShortly after, in November 2024, the Arnault family announced its investment in Paris FC, aiming to take a lower-division club with revenue struggles and turn it into a compelling brand despite a difficult market. (Red Bull was part of the investment as well as a minority stakeholder.)\n\nReaching the status of Paris\u2019s more famous soccer club will be a significant challenge, even for a family with near-limitless resources and decades of branding expertise. Paris Saint-Germain, or PSG, is not only ranked first in France\u2019s top league but has also achieved a global fashion prestige in and of itself, with boutiques in London, New York City, and Seoul, and its ongoing collaboration with Nike\u2019s Jordan Brand. Paris FC has no such merchandising program or international brand recognition yet, but Hensley says the potential is huge. London, after all, has seven teams competing in the Premier League. Why shouldn\u2019t Paris have two top contenders?\n\nWhile PSG is majority-owned by a subsidiary of the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, Paris FC will stand out as one of the few locally owned competitors in French soccer. Its success, then, has the potential to be a matter of national pride, and LVMH has a vested interest in cultivating France\u2019s reputation for excellence and savoir-faire. People love to cheer for the underdog, and luxury executives understand the value of an origin story, says Atti. If Paris FC, currently in second in Ligue 2, were to reach the top flight for the first time since 1978\u20131979, it would be among the most compelling modern ownership success stories.\n\nThere are hurdles, including on-the-field performance. But LVMH and the Arnaults can succeed, he tells FOS, comparing it to the trajectory of a Louis Vuitton staple that went from ordinary to extraordinary: \u201cYou can go from the Louis Vuitton trunk that was done by a guy called Louis, and that was nothing but a trunk, to what it then became.\u201d\n\nThese three massive investments happened within six months, and LVMH has the resources to continue to expand if it wants. The group took in nearly \u20ac85 billion in revenue last year, and the opportunities are nearly endless; the money they\u2019ve put into these sports trumps any other company\u2014yet for LVMH\u2019s bottom line, the money they are infusing is just a drop in the bucket.\n\nMilton Pedraza, founder and CEO of the Luxury Institute, tells FOS he expects more investment to come, even if they don\u2019t move as fast as they have within the past year.\n\n\u201cThey like to start small, incubate, and then scale and elevate,\u201d Pedraza says. Eventually, he says he could see the group having a sports portfolio like the Middle Eastern sovereign funds that have invested heavily in sports clubs around the world. \u201cThere are all kinds of opportunities for them, but they\u2019re meticulous, so they test and learn.\u201d\n\nHe continues, \u201cTheir job is to shatter myths and stereotypes and break through to new innovations. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any sport that has a limit on it. If someday they want to do cornhole, so be it.\u201d",

This partnership follows the company\u2019s role as the official timekeeper for Formula 1, marking a new chapter for both the 100-year-old motorsport event and the watch brand.\n\nCelebrating its 75th year in Formula 1, TAG Heuer\u2019s continued association with the event highlights its deep-rooted connection to motorsport and the celebrated Monaco race. The brand\u2019s rich history with the Circuit de Monaco is intertwined with its iconic TAG Heuer Monaco watch collection, which has become synonymous with the event. As a result, the race will now officially be known as the Formula 1 TAG Heuer Grand Prix de Monaco.\n\nThe luxury watchmaker will be fully integrated into the action throughout the weekend with trackside placements. To mark this historic partnership, a new logo has been designed, which will appear across various platforms where TAG Heuer is showcased. Additionally, the iconic TAG Heuer Monaco clocks will be prominently displayed throughout the paddock, making their debut as a new fixture.\n\nTAG Heuer\u2019s legacy in Monaco spans decades, with renowned drivers like Jochen Rindt, Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, and Ayrton Senna all sporting Heuer chronographs during their victories at the legendary race. In recent years, the brand\u2019s presence has continued, supporting modern-day champions such as Daniel Ricciardo, Max Verstappen, and Sergio P\u00e9rez as they celebrated podium finishes on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur. This multi-year deal also expands TAG Heuer\u2019s involvement with motorsport, as the brand becomes a key partner of the Rallye Monte-Carlo Historique.\n\n\u201cMonaco is truly our spiritual home, encapsulating much of what we stand for at TAG Heuer,\u201d says its CEO, Antoine Pin, in a press statement. \u201cThe spirit of competition, the challenging street course that rewards those who show the greatest mental resilience and physical strength, a place where driver\u2019s push themselves to achieve their absolute best, we are honoured and delighted to renew our partnership with the Automobile Club de Monaco and extend our activities in the Principality with TAG Heuer being the first to hold this prestigious title.\u201d\n\nAnd you can check out all those new track additions for yourself during the F1 race, which takes place from 22 to 25 May 2025 this spring.\n\nThis story was first published on Robb Report USA.

            "content": "Formula One kicks off its Grand Prix season in Melbourne in March, and for the first time in more than a decade, Rolex\u2019s gold-crown logo and brand name won\u2019t adorn the podium, race track, and start clock. As part of a 10-year, multibrand deal between F1 and LVMH\u2014the world\u2019s largest luxury group\u2014watchmaker TAG Heuer will take over official timekeeping honors, and Louis Vuitton will debut as the race title sponsor.\n\nAfter a 25-year hiatus, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon\u2014also an LVMH property\u2014will return as F1\u2019s dedicated champagne provider, replacing the competing bubbly brands that recent winners have sprayed into the crowds. The winemaker has also unseated Rolex\u2019s naming rights to the Belgian Grand Prix in July.\n\nLVMH\u2019s brands\u2014like their luxury peers\u2014have long turned popular athletes into campaign ambassadors, lent their expertise to designing team uniforms, and courted wealthy fans through sponsorships. But the partnership\u2014reportedly worth more than $100 million a year\u2014is much more than a one-off publicity grab by a business more known for its fashion, jewelry, and beauty expertise. LVMH is becoming a serious sports power player.\n\nIts portfolio brands were everywhere in last summer\u2019s Olympics thanks to a \u20ac150 million investment: In the opening ceremony, Louis Vuitton monogrammed steamer trunks got prime placement, as performers like C\u00e9line Dion and Lady Gaga boated down the Seine in head-to-toe Dior. Team France competed in Berluti uniforms, and medals designed by jeweler Chaumet were presented on distinctive Vuitton-branded leather trays. (Its presence was so ubiquitous, some officials and fellow sponsors later complained to the media about the pervasiveness of the branding.)\n\nIn November, the Arnault family\u2014headed by LVMH founder, chairman, and CEO Bernard Arnault\u2014announced they had acquired a majority stake in Paris FC, a French second-tier soccer club. According to French media, the initial investment was valued at \u20ac100 to \u20ac200 million, and in the coming years, the Arnaults are expected to make a substantial push to both burnish the club\u2019s brand and elevate its performance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a luxury group take such broad strides across sport and sporting sponsorship,\u201d Hugo Hensley, head of sports services at the valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance, tells Front Office Sports.\n\nJon Durr/Imagn Images\n\nBrand awareness is a big part of this push, but the larger prize\u2014and an opportunity afforded only by sports\u2014is hooking the most valuable clients. Further, in wealth intelligence company Altrata\u2019s latest billionaire census, it found that sports indexed as the top hobby for 70% of men and 29% of women, ranking above pursuits like arts and education.\n\nHensley sees the LVMH deals as a natural fit for the brand, reaching different audiences and allowing the company to flex a variety of skills, from overhauling a merchandise collection to hosting events with top-spending clients.\n\n\u201cThere is a real camaraderie in sport that is very hard for luxury to find anywhere else,\u201d says Matteo Atti, a professor of luxury business at the International University of Monaco. \u201cIt tends to be so polished that you hardly ever go beyond the ads, and sport removes that layer of veneer and can bring people again face-to-face.\u201d\n\nLVMH is hardly the only luxury fashion player staking its claim on sports: In 2023, Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, who leads the conglomerate\u2019s biggest rival, Kering, acquired a majority stake in Creative Artists Agency, the entertainment and sports agency that reps many of the world\u2019s top athletes. He has also owned the French soccer team Stade Rennais FC since 1998. Chanel, meanwhile, signed a long-term deal last year to become title sponsor and timekeeping partner of The Boat Race, the much-watched rowing competition between Oxford and Cambridge universities.\n\nBut with LVMH\u2019s deep pockets and 75-brand portfolio, it\u2019s able to go much bigger.\n\nLVMH is pushing hard off the back of its successful premium sponsorship of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nIn October 2024, LVMH inked the F1 deal. The brand should see immediate impacts at the racetrack, among cars going 200 miles per hour. F1 is an obvious target for the luxury group, with its audience of global travelers and business leaders, including many ultra-wealthy fans who will jet to Miami or Monaco for a weekend to take in a race.\n\n\u201cI think Formula One retains that simplicity and immediacy that is incredible. But also, I think for luxury, specifically, it has now become so technical; it really showcases a level of know-how that is unbeatable,\u201d says Atti, who is also global chief marketing officer at private aviation company Vista, which, like LVMH, has made significant investments in motorsports, similarly attracted both by its international appeal and the opportunities to get up close and personal with clients. \u201cIt\u2019s the physical strength, the physical prowess, preparation, and alignment with the machinery\u2014all of that together, against the weather, against the conditions, and against all the odds.\u201d\n\nAndy Abeyta/Imagn Images\n\nShortly after, in November 2024, the Arnault family announced its investment in Paris FC, aiming to take a lower-division club with revenue struggles and turn it into a compelling brand despite a difficult market. (Red Bull was part of the investment as well as a minority stakeholder.)\n\nReaching the status of Paris\u2019s more famous soccer club will be a significant challenge, even for a family with near-limitless resources and decades of branding expertise. Paris Saint-Germain, or PSG, is not only ranked first in France\u2019s top league but has also achieved a global fashion prestige in and of itself, with boutiques in London, New York City, and Seoul, and its ongoing collaboration with Nike\u2019s Jordan Brand. Paris FC has no such merchandising program or international brand recognition yet, but Hensley says the potential is huge. London, after all, has seven teams competing in the Premier League. Why shouldn\u2019t Paris have two top contenders?\n\nWhile PSG is majority-owned by a subsidiary of the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, Paris FC will stand out as one of the few locally owned competitors in French soccer. Its success, then, has the potential to be a matter of national pride, and LVMH has a vested interest in cultivating France\u2019s reputation for excellence and savoir-faire. People love to cheer for the underdog, and luxury executives understand the value of an origin story, says Atti. If Paris FC, currently in second in Ligue 2, were to reach the top flight for the first time since 1978\u20131979, it would be among the most compelling modern ownership success stories.\n\nThere are hurdles, including on-the-field performance. But LVMH and the Arnaults can succeed, he tells FOS, comparing it to the trajectory of a Louis Vuitton staple that went from ordinary to extraordinary: \u201cYou can go from the Louis Vuitton trunk that was done by a guy called Louis, and that was nothing but a trunk, to what it then became.\u201d\n\nThese three massive investments happened within six months, and LVMH has the resources to continue to expand if it wants. The group took in nearly \u20ac85 billion in revenue last year, and the opportunities are nearly endless; the money they\u2019ve put into these sports trumps any other company\u2014yet for LVMH\u2019s bottom line, the money they are infusing is just a drop in the bucket.\n\nMilton Pedraza, founder and CEO of the Luxury Institute, tells FOS he expects more investment to come, even if they don\u2019t move as fast as they have within the past year.\n\n\u201cThey like to start small, incubate, and then scale and elevate,\u201d Pedraza says. Eventually, he says he could see the group having a sports portfolio like the Middle Eastern sovereign funds that have invested heavily in sports clubs around the world. \u201cThere are all kinds of opportunities for them, but they\u2019re meticulous, so they test and learn.\u201d\n\nHe continues, \u201cTheir job is to shatter myths and stereotypes and break through to new innovations. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any sport that has a limit on it. If someday they want to do cornhole, so be it.\u201d",

Since its inception in 2013, the prize has been transformative in the industry, catapulting emerging designers to international acclaim. This year\u2019s selection showcases a bold departure from minimalism, embracing daring silhouettes, masterful embellishments, and a revival of high-concept tailoring.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2025 semi-finalists span 15 different countries, marking a significant step towards inclusivity with first-time entrants from Egypt, Ghana, and Saudi Arabia. Among the rising stars are Alainpaul by Alain Paul (France), All-in by Benjamin Barron & Bror August Vestb\u00f8 (USA & Norway), Boyedoe by David Boye-Doe Kusi (Ghana), Francesco Murano (Italy), Josh Tafoya (USA), and KML by Ahmed Hassan (Saudi Arabia). Other standouts include Meruert Tolegen by Meruert Planul-Tolegen (USA), MFPEN by Sigurd Bank (Denmark), Nicklas Skovgaard (Denmark), Penultimate by Xiang Gao (China), Pillings by Ryota Murakami (Japan), and Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Dwyer (Ireland).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese semi-finalists will present their collections in Paris on March 5-6, coinciding with Paris Fashion Week. A panel of esteemed industry experts will then determine the eight finalists, each vying for the ultimate prize: \u20ac400,000 and a year-long mentorship from LVMH\u2019s leading professionals in areas such as sustainability, brand development, and business strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther accolades include the Karl Lagerfeld Prize, awarding \u20ac200,000 and mentorship, and the Savoir-Faire Prize, which launched last year when Michael Stewart, who founded Standing Ground, won the prize. The Savoir-Faire Prize celebrates exceptional craftsmanship and innovation, in which the winners are also awarded \u20ac200,000 along with a one-year mentorship.",

Herm\u00e8s passed the \u20ac200 billion market value mark in 2023 and is now edging closer to the market capitalisation of larger rival LVMH.\n\nThe Paris-based company reported a 17.6 per cent increase in fourth-quarter revenue to \u20ac3.96 billion, well ahead of consensus forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. It said sales grew by double-digit percentages in every region with the exception of Asia-Pacific excluding Japan, where growth reached 8.9 per cent \u2014 also above consensus \u2014 amid a depressed luxury market.\n\n\u201cIn 2024, in a more uncertain economic and geopolitical context, the solid performance of the results attests to the strength of the Hermes model,\u201d said executive chair Axel Dumas.\n\nThe high-end luxury house said recurring operating income in 2024 was \u20ac6.15 billion, slightly ahead of expectations, with a sales margin of more than 40 per cent.\n\nIts shares have outpaced rivals including LVMH as well as the more troubled Kering, owner of Gucci.\n\nHermes said it would continue to grow at constant exchange rates in 2025 and that it was starting the year with \u201cconfidence\u201d despite the uncertain economic and geopolitical environment.\n\nThe company is one of the strongest brands in luxury, known for its resilience during downturns because of its wealthy client base \u2014 largely immune to economic cycles \u2014 and a restrained production model, which is far outstripped by demand.\n\nIts coveted Kelly bag, for example, has a starting price point of about \u20ac8,000, with clients often waiting months or years to buy one.\n\nHermes\u2019 ready-to-wear fashion and leather goods divisions, its two biggest, grew double digits in the fourth quarter, with leather goods \u2014 which accounts for roughly half of group sales \u2014 growing fastest at 21.5 per cent, roundly beating consensus.\n\nHowever, the watches division was its weakest in 2024, with sales falling 4.2 per cent organically over the year because of a \u201cmore challenging context and a high comparison basis\u201d, the company said. Its silks and textiles division also grew at a slower single-digit rate, indicating pressures on middle-class shoppers.\n\nHermes has outperformed peers through the luxury downturn, including in a depressed Chinese market where it has been one of the few brands to grow consistently last year. Dumas said it was too early to see an inflection point in the market, despite some positive early signs.\n\n\u201cThat Hermes is in the ideal position to provide unrivalled sector market share gains is not up for debate,\u201d said James Grzinic, analyst at Jefferies, while any impact from US trade tariffs \u201cwould be recovered through pricing\u201d.\n\nHermes has in recent years been more restrained in increasing prices than most of its peers, giving it more latitude to do so now. Dumas said the company planned to raise prices between 6 and 7 per cent this year, slightly less than in 2024.\n\nStory first appeared in Financial Times,\n\nFinancial Times\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nX\n\n",

            "content": "LVMH and Kering Rule Luxury; It\u2019s Time to Move On\n\nIn the world of luxury fashion, two giants\u2014Kering and LVMH (Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton)\u2014have long ruled supreme. Setting trends, influencing tastes, defining what luxury means to millions of people worldwide, these companies have molded the sector. But when we explore the present situation of luxury apparel, a strong case arises: aside from high couture, luxury has basically evolved into mass-produced retail. The sector, customers, and creatives might all be ready to break out from this paradigm.\n\nDominance of LVMH and Kering\n\nUnder names like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Gucci, and Saint Laurent, LVMH and Kering oversee a sizable share of the luxury market. Strategic acquisitions, a large worldwide retail presence, and brand reputation leveraging have helped them to reach this high prices for their goods. Unquestionably, they are successful, but their success comes with a price to the core of what luxury meant.\n\nFrom Accessibility to Exclusivity\n\nOnce luxury was defined by uniqueness, handcrafted work, and personal service. But as profit maximization and expansion drive demand, luxury items have lately been more easily available to a larger audience. This change was enabled by:\n\nMass Production: To satisfy worldwide demand, even luxury brands now depend on mass production, therefore compromising the unique character of luxury goods.\n\nSeasonal Collections: The unrelenting cycle of fashion seasons has produced an oversupply of goods where originality gives place to universality.\n\nLuxury labels have embraced outlet stores and discount events, therefore advancing the commoditization of luxury.\n\nHaute Couture: The exception\n\nFor these companies, high couture is still the stronghold of actual luxury. It\u2019s where the artistry of fashion, with its painstaking attention to detail, custom fit, and handcrafted procedures, is maintained. But couture is, by design, only for a very small audience and accounts for a meager portion of these enterprises\u2019 income. This degree of luxury is more aspirational than reasonable for the regular customer.\n\nThe Argument for Onward Development\n\nThe LVMH and Kering-dominated modern luxury model has various ramifications:\n\nA few companies controlling the majority of the market runs the danger of stifling innovation. Smaller, independent designers and brands could find it difficult to break through, therefore homogenizing style and inventiveness.\n\nCultural Change: Younger especially consumers are appreciating authenticity and personal connection above brand reputation more and more. Their search is for companies that speak to their beliefs rather than only their budgets.\n\nThe Way Ahead\n\nMoving forward redefines the luxury market rather than means rejecting it.\n\nEncouragement of a scene whereby emerging designers may flourish\u2014perhaps by means of funding, mentorships, or venues that give innovation above mainstream appeal top priority.\n\nConsumer Education: Changing demand and expectations by teaching consumers what actual luxury means\u2014craftsmanship and uniqueness\u2014 and no doubt that has suffered as we are seeing this on may of the retail products.\n\nDigital and Experiential Luxury: The future of luxury might lay in experiences, digital goods, or services that cannot be mass-produced and hence provide uniqueness in fresh forms.\n\n\n\nLVMH (Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton) owns a vast portfolio of luxury brands across various sectors. Here is a comprehensive list of some of the notable brands under LVMH:\n\nFashion & Leather Goods:\n\nLouis Vuitton\n\nChristian Dior\n\nFendi\n\nC\u00e9line\n\nLoewe\n\nKenzo\n\nGivenchy\n\nMarc Jacobs\n\nEmilio Pucci\n\nBerluti\n\nLoro Piana\n\nRimowa\n\nPatou\n\nPerfumes & Cosmetics:\n\nChristian Dior Perfumes\n\nGuerlain\n\nGivenchy Beauty\n\nBenefit Cosmetics\n\nMake Up For Ever\n\nFresh\n\nAcqua di Parma\n\nKVD Beauty\n\nWatches & Jewelry:\n\nBulgari\n\nTAG Heuer\n\nHublot\n\nZenith\n\nFred\n\nChaumet\n\nTiffany & Co.\n\nWines & Spirits:\n\nMo\u00ebt & Chandon\n\nDom P\u00e9rignon\n\nVeuve Clicquot\n\nHennessy\n\nGlenmorangie\n\nArdbeg\n\nKrug\n\nCh\u00e2teau d\u2019Yquem\n\nSelective Retailing:\n\nSephora\n\nLe Bon March\u00e9\n\nLa Samaritaine\n\nDFS (Duty Free Shoppers)\n\nOther Activities:\n\nLes Echos (media)\n\nCheval Blanc (hotels)\n\nBelmond (luxury travel)\n\n\n\nKering owns several renowned luxury brands across various sectors including fashion, leather goods, jewelry, and eyewear.

The winery, owned by luxury giant LVMH since 2001, was destroyed in the 2020 Glass fire and has been making wine in a temporary space since. The statement cited the fire as the reason ownership made the difficult decision.\n\nNewton was founded in 1977 by Peter Newton, an English journalist, Oxford-trained lawyer and paper magnate. With the help of then-wife Su Hua, he built Newton into a jewel of a boutique winery at the base of Spring Mountain, just uphill from St. Helena. Winding, steep roads lead to a red telephone booth that would announce guests, who arrived at the cellars to find meticulous English gardens, stunning mountaintop views and a pagoda-inspired winery. Most of the 560-acre property was hidden by a rugged forest.\n\nLVMH acquired a majority stake in 2001. Peter Newton died in 2008 at 81, and his family held on to a 10 percent ownership stake.\n\nBy 2020, the estate had 74 acres of vines divided into 70 different blocks, mostly planted on steep hillsides ranging in elevation from 500 to 1,600 feet, primarily planted to Cabernet Sauvignon. The winery also owned estate vineyards in Mt. Veeder, Yountville and Carneros. LVMH had invested $10 million to renovate the winery and convert the vineyards to certified organic farming.\n\nBut it was Newton\u2019s Unfiltered Chardonnay that perhaps had the most impact on the industry. A bold wine, originally made by winemaker John Kongsgaard, it would become a benchmark.\n\nNewton lost its winery and many of its vines in the Glass fire of 2020. (Courtesy Newton)\n\nThe 2020 Glass fire tore through the property, leaving only 5 acres of vines remaining. The staff announced plans to bring the property back to life and opened a temporary tasting room in Calistoga to welcome guests. There was no indication the brand would disappear.\n\nLVMH owns other Napa properties, including Colgin, Joseph Phelps and Domaine Chandon.\n\nStay on top of important wine stories with Wine Spectator's free Breaking News Alerts.",

            "content": "Investors in LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne ( ) had a good week, as its shares rose 4.2% to close at \u20ac713 following the release of its full-year results. Revenues of \u20ac85b were in line with forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) came in below expectations at \u20ac25.12, missing estimates by 7.7%. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne's 25 analysts is for revenues of \u20ac89.6b in 2025. This would reflect a satisfactory 5.8% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to expand 12% to \u20ac28.12. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of \u20ac89.5b and earnings per share (EPS) of \u20ac28.36 in 2025. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at \u20ac750. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne analyst has a price target of \u20ac888 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at \u20ac618. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same are performing. We would highlight that LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 5.8% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 14% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 7.5% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.\n\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

            "content": "Earlier today, Feb. 13, luxury conglomerate LVMH shared the list of 20 designers who had been named semifinalists for the annual LVMH Prize. They were chosen from over 2,300 applicants and hail from 15 countries. If they win at the prize ceremony in March, they'll earn unfettered access to mentorship from leading designers within the LVMH stable\u2014along with the sort of funding that can make or break a small fashion brand.\n\nThe list includes names anyone training a close eye on the fashion month calendar's debut schedule will recognize: like Niklas Skovgaard, whose '80s-inspired dresses have been a fixture at Copenhagen Fashion Week in recent seasons, and All-In, the joint venture from Benjamin Barron and Bror August Vestb\u00f8 that counts Charli XCX and Lily Rose-Depp among its rapidly-growing fanbase. It's a competitive race every year, and winners have gone on to become industry staples with backing from the panel of 80 fashion experts who decide the final prizes. (See: 2016 winner Grace Wales Bonner and 2020 finalist Chopova Lowena.) But this year's list makes this editor particularly excited about the future of fashion.\n\nThe full list of the 2025 LVMH Prize Semifinalists. (Image credit: LVMH)\n\nThere is, of course, incontestable talent on display. Marie Claire fashion features editor Emma Childs was thrilled to see Kazakhstani designer Meruert Tolegen on the list, after Tolegen had thoroughly impressed our team during her New York Fashion Week debut one year ago. \"Tolegen showed floral puffer coats, peplum bustiers, and lace-trimmed taffeta skirts that called on the unapologetic femininity of Simone Rocha and Cecilie Bahnsen,\" Childs tells me. \"But by using heritage prints and craft techniques native to the Kazakh culture, Tolegen made it clear she's operating from an individual POV. I left the show beguiled by the brand and eager for all that was to come from her.\"\n\nIn lock-step with all 20 designers' attention to form, fit, and aesthetics comes a notable emphasis on forward-thinking design and inclusion. Six labels\u2014including Boyedoe, Josh Tafoya, and the aforementioned All-In\u2014produce genderless collections. Eight are helmed by women designers\u2014notable in an industry where women don't often shop from designers who get them. Two London-based standouts, Tolu Coker and Torish\u00e9ju Dumi, bring complementary (but not at all identical) interpretations of their founders Nigerian culture to the stages of London and Paris Fashion Week. And, they've done so while earning praise from the likes of Doechii and Zendaya.\n\n\"Dumi certainly knows how to put on a spectacle and generate hubbub,\" says Childs, \"but above all, she's an artist with something to say.\"\n\nDoechii has supported London-based designer Tolu Coker on the red carpet... (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\n...while Zendaya championed Torish\u00e9ju Dumi on the Dune: Part Two press tour. (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe same assessment applies to Irish designer Sin\u00e9ad O'Dwyer, who generated the biggest headlines at Copenhagen Fashion Week last August with a show that featured a fully size-inclusive cast. She also brought the fashion week's first visually-impaired model onto her modern workwear runway\u2014a reminder that everyone can and should participate in fashion.\n\nSin\u00e9ad O'Dwyer brought a revolutionarily inclusive approach to her Copenhagen Fashion Week runway, with a cast that included all sizes and abilities. (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nOutside fashion industry circles, distinctions like the LVMH Prize might not register. But trust that the home of Dior, Louis Vuitton, and Celine recognizing labels like Coker's and O'Dwyer's is a big deal. There's an implicit understanding here that great clothes are an essential part of the style conversation, but so are modes of expression that include more than the traditional perspective. And as the fashion business only gets more challenging for emerging labels, backing from powerhouses is all the more imperative to foster their growth.\n\nStay In The Know Get exclusive access to fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

This award highlights the importance of craftsmanship, innovation and sustainability, echoing three key issues for today\u2019s fashion and luxury industries.\n\n\n\nI would like to congratulate all the semi-finalists and look forward to meeting them at our showroom in Paris.\u201d\n\n\n\n2025 LVMH PRIZE: THE TWENTY SEMI-FINALISTS\n\n\n\nALAINPAUL by Alain Paul, France, womenswear, menswear and genderless collections\n\n\n\nALL-IN by Benjamin Barron, United States, and Bror August Vestb\u00f8, Norway, womenswear and genderless collections\n\n\n\nBOYEDOE by David Boye-Doe Kusi, Ghana, genderless collections\n\n\n\nFRANCESCO MURANO by Francesco Murano, Italy, womenswear\n\n\n\nJOSH TAFOYA by Josh Tafoya, United States, genderless collections\n\n\n\nKML by Ahmed Hassan, Saudi Arabia, menswear and genderless collections\n\n\n\nMERUERT TOLEGEN by Meruert Planul-Tolegen, United States, womenswear\n\n\n\nMFPEN by Sigurd Bank, Denmark, womenswear and menswear\n\n\n\nNICKLAS SKOVGAARD by Nicklas Skovgaard, Denmark, womenswear\n\n\n\nPENULTIMATE by Xiang Gao, China, genderless collections\n\n\n\nPILLINGS by Ryota Murakami, Japan, womenswear\n\n\n\nRENAISSANCE RENAISSANCE by Cynthia Merhej, Lebanon, womenswear\n\n\n\nSINEAD O\u2019DWYER by Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Dwyer, Ireland, womenswear\n\n\n\nSOSHIOTSUKI by Soshi Otsuki, Japan, menswear\n\n\n\nSTEVE O SMITH by Steve O Smith, United Kingdom, womenswear and menswear TOLU COKER by Tolu Coker, United Kingdom, womenswear\n\n\n\nTORISHEJU by Torish\u00e9ju Dumi, United Kingdom, womenswear and menswear YASMIN MANSOUR by Yasmin Mansour, Egypte, womenswear\n\n\n\nYOUNG N SANG by Sang Lim Lee et Youngshin Hong, South Korea, menswear ZOMER by Danial Aitouganov, the Netherlands, womenswear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE LVMH PRIZE INCLUDES THREE AWARDS\n\n\n\nThe LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers, which focuses on creativity, comes with a 400,000-euro endowment.

Next, Victoria and Rob offer some perspective on recent reports of trouble at LVMH-owned Tiffany and of downturns in the Swiss watch market. Finally, the pair pay tribute to the late Harvey Rovinsky, owner of Bernie Robbins, who made news worldwide when he gave his store to his longtime employees.\n\nListen Now\n\n\n\nSponsored by IGI: igi.org\n\nEpisode Credits\n\nHosts: Rob Bates and Victoria Gomelsky\n\nProducer and engineer: Natalie Chomet\n\nEditor: Riley McCaskill\n\nPlugs: @jckmagazine; igi.org\n\nShow Notes\n\n00:55 New York state of mind\n\n04:12 On the clock\n\n07:09 Trying times\n\n09:20 Issues at Tiffany?\n\n14:15 To the races\n\n15:05 Come slither\n\n16:56 Tiffany wrist candy\n\n18:14 2025 watch predictions\n\n20:20 Destination Tucson\n\n21:44 Honoring the man who gave away the store\n\nShow Recap\n\nNew York state of mind\n\nVictoria shares highlights from LVMH\u2019s annual Watch Week, which had to relocate to New York City from Los Angeles because of the wildfires. This gave Victoria a chance to visit the eighth floor of Tiffany\u2019s flagship, the Landmark\u2014it\u2019s a spectacular exhibition space where you can gaze out on LVMH\u2019s other Fifth Avenue gems, like the Bulgari store and the Louis Vuitton flagship (currently under renovation and disguised as a giant stack of the luxury brand\u2019s famous suitcases). \u201cYou\u2019re up there, and it does feel like it\u2019s LVMH\u2019s world and we\u2019re all just living in it,\u201d Vic says.\n\nShe also was struck by the 13-foot-tall animatronic Bird on a Rock sculpture\u2014modeled on the iconic Jean Schlumberger jewelry design\u2014that was perched on the eighth-floor terrace and covered with 60,000 LED lights.\n\nOn the clock\n\nLVMH\u2019s nine timepiece brands were in attendance at Watch Week, along with clockmaker L\u2019Ep\u00e9e 1839, which the conglomerate acquired in 2024. L\u2019Ep\u00e9e produces traditional carriage clocks as well as \u201cfunky\u201d models, Victoria says, mentioning clocks that resemble a vintage Ferrari and a grenade. The latter is likely to stir up mixed emotions, she observes.\n\nRob wonders whether watch and clock collectors overlap. \u201cA little bit,\u201d says Victoria. \u201cI don\u2019t know the size of the clock market\u2014it\u2019s definitely a lot smaller than the wristwatch market. But there are some really storied names [making clocks]. Patek Philippe makes these very famous dome clocks that feature their rare handcrafts, and those are collector items. Jaeger-LeCoultre has, very famously, made a clock called the Atmos for many years\u2026. Van Cleef makes these incredible planetarium clocks. So there is some overlap in the makers. But it is a different business.\u201d\n\nShe credits MB&F\u2014the avant-garde Swiss brand, which Chanel last year took a 25% stake in\u2014for elevating L\u2019Ep\u00e9e and giving it cachet when the two partnered on a limited collection of edgy clocks.\n\nTrying times\n\nVictoria reports that there\u2019s \u201ca lot of angst in the Swiss watch business\u201d right now. She notes the reshuffling of leadership at LVMH\u2019s watch brands in the past six months and a downturn in the Swiss watch market after last year\u2019s record highs.\n\n\u201c[Swiss export figures] just came out,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re down about 5% globally. Even the U.S., the leading market, is down about 1%.\u201d\n\nIssues at Tiffany?\n\nDuring one Watch Week event, Victoria sat across from Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, the second son of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, and CEO of LVMH\u2019s watch division. In Arnault\u2019s public remarks at the dinner, \u201che made sure to tout Tiffany as being number one in sales for the group last year,\u201d she says.\n\nThat would seem to be a response to last month\u2019s Bloomberg story that said Tiffany\u2014which LVMH acquired in 2021\u2014is suffering from low morale and disappointing sales in the United States. On a recent conference call, LVMH executives painted a sunnier picture, claiming the negative reports are just griping by disgruntled former employees.\n\nRob felt the LVMH executives \u201cwere a little defensive. They wanted people to make sure people knew that this acquisition, which is the largest acquisition that they\u2019ve ever done and is extremely high-profile and widely watched, [is] going well\u2026.\n\n\u201cThey are investing a lot of money in things like the Landmark, and remodeling all their stores,\u201d Rob adds. \u201cYou wonder, they\u2019re laying out so much money for this brand\u2026. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s helping sales to some extent, but how profitable is [it]? And these stories [that say] they\u2019re driving their salespeople so hard, it gives you a little pause.\u201d\n\nVictoria found that at Watch Week \u201ca lot of these [LVMH brand] CEOs spoke in way more platitudes than even I\u2019m used to\u2026. It ends up feeling you\u2019re having a conversation with a lot of hot air. There\u2019s nothing actually being said.\u201d\n\nTo the races\n\nAlso during Watch Week, TAG Heuer promoted its new sponsorship of Formula 1 racing, previously held by Rolex. \u201cLVMH came in and wrested it away,\u201d Victoria says. \u201cOne of the reasons they were able to overcome Rolex\u2014which is unusual; Rolex generally dominates this kind of thing\u2014was that they offered a broader kind of package\u2026. Obviously there\u2019s more brands LVMH can use to help promote and amplify the Formula One message, and Rolex is just Rolex.\u201d\n\nCome slither\n\nVic notes that Bulgari has doubled down on its snake-themed Serpenti collection\u2014apropos since it\u2019s the Year of the Snake according to the Chinese zodiac. The luxury brand introduced its first Serpenti watch in 1948 and rebooted the entire collection in 2010. You can\u2019t overstate the snake design\u2019s importance to Bulgari, says Victoria. It\u2019s everywhere, from watches to jewelry to bags. She says Bulgari CEO Jean-Christophe Babin recently told her that \u201cSerpenti is Bulgari, and Bulari is Serpenti.\u201d\n\nAt Watch Week, Bulgari introduced a very small mechanical movement designed to fit in the head of the snake that adorns all Serpenti pieces.\n\nTiffany wrist candy\n\nTiffany, too, is building its watch business, Victoria says. The collection includes \u201ca lot of very high-end, very jeweled pieces,\u201d she says. At Watch Week, the company showed off a lot of dramatic watches, many with Bird on a Rock themes. \u201cThat icon is appearing all over the place\u201d at Tiffany, she says.\n\n2025 watch predictions\n\nWhat\u2019s ahead for the watch world? \u201cI think it\u2019s a tougher year,\u201d Victoria says. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of way past that peak post-pandemic, when the watch business was on an extreme high and there was such waiting lists for products coming out from the big, big brands. That spilled over into the secondary market\u2014meaning that people were offering to pay three, four, five times retail value for some models that were flipped.\u201d\n\nNow the waiting lists have shrunk, and the decline in the secondary market has repercussions for the primary market and vice versa, says Vic.\n\n\u201cI think people are nervous,\u201d she says. \u201cThey talk about limiting their retail outlets and trying to starve the market, so you do get this buildup in demand, but ultimately they do need to sell, and they need to sell in some volume.\u201d\n\nStay tuned for more insights from Victoria following her visit to the Watches and Wonders show in Geneva, Switzerland, in April.\n\nDestination Tucson\n\nVic was heading to the gem shows in Tucson shortly after recording the podcast. She\u2019s anticipating higher prices for colored stones, with demand for materials rising as finer stones have become harder to find\u2014but she promises listeners a full report from Tucson in an upcoming episode of The Jewelry District.\n\nVictoria mentions that on her trip last summer to a sapphire mine in Montana with Parl\u00e9 Gems, sources told her gem prices had risen about 20%, especially on rarer and bigger material.\n\nHer advice? \u201cYou have to budget,\u201d she says, conceding that she\u2019s grateful she\u2019s not a buyer when she goes to Tucson.\n\nHonoring the man who gave away the store\n\nVictoria and Rob pay tribute to Harvey Rovinsky, former owner of premium jeweler Bernie Robbins, who died in late January. When Rovinsky started planning his retirement, he decided he didn\u2019t want to close his stores and put his people out of work. So instead he transferred ownership of the New Jersey chain\u2014free of charge, with no debt\u2014to six longtime employees.\n\n\u201cThat kind of generous gesture, it\u2019s truly amazing,\u201d says Rob. \u201cIt made the news all over the world\u2026. He liked the idea of his employees taking over the company and bringing it to the next level.\u201d\n\nSadly, Rovinsky died shortly after he announced his official retirement from the business on Jan. 1.\n\nVic remembers him \u201cas the consummate jeweler\u2026. What a wonderful legacy he\u2019s left. It\u2019s remarkable to hear about his generosity to his employees.\u201d\n\nAny views expressed in this podcast do not reflect the opinion of JCK, its management, or its advertisers.",

The case sought to compel X to compensate publishers for content under EU copyright rules.\n\nThe lawsuit, initially backed by Les Echos-Le Parisien, Le Monde, and Le Figaro, aimed to enforce compliance with legislation ensuring fair compensation for digital use of journalistic content. LVMH\u2019s decision to withdraw from the legal action was reportedly communicated to executives from other media groups, though the rationale remains unclear.\n\nDespite this, Le Monde and Le Figaro have filed a joint case to pursue unpaid compensation. Les Echos-Le Parisien previously argued that platforms like X must adhere to EU copyright laws to protect the future of quality journalism.\n\nLVMH, which owns various French media outlets, has previously challenged tech giants like Google and Meta on similar grounds. While declining to comment, LVMH continues to expand its media influence, recently acquiring Paris Match and a French radio station.\n\nFor more information on these topics, visit diplomacy.edu.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy \u2013 Louis Vuitton, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (OTC:LVMHF) stands against other best annual dividend stocks to buy now.\n\nIn 2025, dividends in MSCI Europe are expected to reach a record high. According to Allianz Global Investors, these firms are likely to increase dividend payouts by 4% year-over-year to \u20ac459 billion, up from \u20ac440 billion in 2024. In 2026, MSCI Europe dividends could catapult even higher to \u20ac496 billion. In Germany alone, payouts are projected to rise from \u20ac57 billion in 2024 to \u20ac63 billion in 2025, and possibly hit \u20ac70 billion in 2026. Allianz Global expects the Tech and Healthcare sectors to offer the highest dividend increases in 2025, while the Energy sector could likely create some weakness. The Financials sector will remain the biggest dividend contributor in Europe. Dividend yields are staying ahead of long-term German government bond yields as well, with the MSCI Europe dividend yield expected to be 3.5% this year.\n\nOver the last 40 years, about 39% of MSCI Europe\u2019s total annualized return resulted from dividends. Comparatively, dividend payouts made up 22% of total returns in MSCI North America and just over 41% in MSCI Pacific.\n\nJenny Harrington, CNBC Halftime Report\u2019s go-to expert on dividends, observed that the broader market\u2019s dividends have grown about 5.7% in the last 50-60 years, which means that dividend income is outpacing inflation. She also noted that dividends are a tax-advantaged income stream, which is a huge plus. Harrington also commented that dividend investors are more likely to hold their portfolios rather than selling in a panic when markets go down. They are reluctant to give up their income streams and risk wasting years of effort, which helps keep dividend portfolios steady and resilient, even during market selloffs.\n\nHarrington also told investors that some companies may not have strong growth potential but generate high free cash flow, allowing them to pay dividends. However, those seeking high-growth stocks should carefully balance their portfolios. Harrington advised investors to explore opportunities beyond the broader market, as the index is heavily dominated by its top 10 stocks. She suggested that looking at other companies, including dividend stocks, could offer better value and growth potential. Given this, we will now take a look at some of the best annual dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we manually researched annual reports and company websites to see which stocks pay dividends annually. We focused on picking stocks with a consistent record of paying dividends, offering dividend growth, and being financially stable to steer clear of yield traps. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of dividend yield as of February 6.",

Now, the two brands are facing serious headwinds.\n\nBoth Dior and Gucci have long faced the same challenger\u2019s dilemma: Gucci aspires to be as good as Louis Vuitton, while Dior aspires to be as good as Chanel, but both brands are smaller than their rivals and that\u2019s a tricky place to be in a fixed cost industry, where scale benefits are significant.\n\nTo keep up, smaller brands need to grow faster, and the pursuit of rapid growth can push them to lean heavily into the zeitgeist, moving out of \u201ccentre stage\u201d to find the aesthetic space in the market where consumer tailwinds blow stronger. This, coupled to a commercial approach that pushed lower-priced streetwear and accessories, was the essence of Kering\u2019s Gucci strategy under designer Alessandro Michele.\n\nThe approach can deliver spectacular results, but it eventually makes you spikier: more likely to be out of sync with the next fashion cycle, heightening the risk of brand fatigue when the zeitgeist moves on. Spiky and in sync with the zeitgeist is marvellous; spiky and out of sync is a disaster.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThose who stay \u201ccentre stage\u201d can always move a little to the left or a little to the right to capture the prevailing zeitgeist. But those who move to a more extreme position, even if it\u2019s the \u201cright\u201d position when they make the manoeuvre, can find themselves in a very wrong place when tastes change.\n\nThis is the problem Gucci faces in a \u201cquiet luxury\u201d world: even if it tries to be quiet, it doesn\u2019t look credible to those who want quiet (while no longer accommodating those who don\u2019t), which is part of the reason why the company\u2019s aesthetic U-turn \u2014 from the exuberance of Michele to the demure style of Sabato De Sarno \u2014 failed to gain traction, resulting in De Sarno\u2019s ouster.\n\nDior, on the other hand, has made steadier changes to its creative content. The brand recently parted ways with men\u2019s artistic director Kim Jones and is expected to separate from women\u2019s designer Maria Grazia Chiuri later in the year, but a wholesale transformation of the brand\u2019s aesthetic seems unlikely.\n\nDior has also exercised a very different level of restraint on the commercial front. Gucci never really gave up its dependency on factory outlets, which we estimated to account for 15 percent of sales even at the height of the brand\u2019s success. Gucci has also remained exposed to wholesale, even if it has halved its dependence on the channel over the past 10 years. Meanwhile, Dior has kept its exposure to outlets and wholesale to a minimum. It has also limited how many easy products, like sneakers and t-shirts, it sells to the public. And if Dior\u2019s off-kilter pricing is the result of pushing too far upmarket (to match Chanel?), Gucci is still trying to price up.\n\nAs a result, the magnitude of the problems facing Gucci and Dior are different. At Dior, a higher level of restraint in selling accessible products; tighter control of distribution; and no attempt to completely change the brand aesthetics appear to be associated with a less severe amount of top line damage. Even if Gucci\u2019s performance is fully visible, and Dior\u2019s performance needs to be estimated, Dior\u2019s growth appears to have been down in the low double-digits in the third quarter of last year, whereas Gucci was down by 25 percent. Furthermore, LVMH can absorb temporary weakness at Dior, which drove 23 percent of LVMH\u2019s fashion and leather goods top-line in 2023 (about 12 percent of group sales). Kering less so: Gucci contributed 61 percent of group revenue in the same period.\n\nNeither brand seems close to solving its problems, however. Gucci is engaged in significant upheaval on both the creative and management sides, delaying the prospect of a turnaround. By comparison, Dior has introduced tweaks to its organisation: in addition to the departure of Jones, former Miu Miu chief Benedetta Petruzzo has replaced Charles Delapalme as managing director. Is it enough?\n\nLuca Solca is head of luxury goods research at Bernstein.\n\nDisclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion.

And last fall LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton sealed a 10-year deal with F1.\n\nAs last year\u2019s highest-paid driver, Max Verstappen, a four-time F1 world champion, took home an annual salary of $60 million and $15 million in bonuses. And the F1 racer Lewis Hamilton, a member of the host committee for this year\u2019s Met Gala, is not the only luxury fashion force in and out of the pit.\n\nMax Verstappen on the track during the F1 U.S. Grand Prix at Circuit of The Americas in Austin. PHOTO BY RUDY CAREZZEVOLI/GETTY IMAGES\n\nThe Dutch-Belgian Verstappen racked up his fourth consecutive title last year for Red Bull, but there are reports that his long-term future with the team is a question mark. The 27-year-old\u2019s contract with the energy drink company will run down in 2028.\n\nVerstappen has just been tapped as the official global brand ambassador for AlphaTauri, Red Bull\u2019s premium fashion lifestyle brand. Going forward, he will sport the brand while traveling to the 24 locations on the 2025 Formula 1 calendar \u2014 and doing so in style. In a promotional video interview about his latest endeavor, Verstappen said securing his fourth win has been \u201ca dream.\u201d He is looking forward \u201cto seeing how competitive we can be this year. Once you realize how competitive you are, you set a bit of a target, but that\u2019s too early to say at the moment.\u201d The driver said that he is \u201cexcited\u201d to be working with a new teammate, Liam Lawson.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nAlphaTauri offers understated functional apparel, hats, scarves, wallets and bags for women and men. One of the upcoming releases for men is a waterproof lightweight jacket that will retail for 650 euros, and styles include a stretch blazer for 429 euros and a waterproof lightweight jacket for 350 euros. Describing his own style as \u201cvery basic,\u201d he said, \u201cWith the help of AlphaTauri, that will probably help my style a little bit.\u201d\n\nMax Verstappen with Kelly Piquet. GETTY IMAGES\n\nHis Brazilian model partner Kelly Piquet is a familiar face on the designer scene. Equally at ease at Paris Fashion Week or on the F1 circuit, she knows of what she speaks. Her father Nelson was a three-time F1 World Champion and the father of her own daughter is F1 driver Daniil Kvyat.\n\nKnown to be grounded, Verstappen told WWD in an interview 15 months ago, \u201cWhat\u2019s most important is to be yourself. That is very important in order to move forward outside of racing. Having people see the real me is the only way that they can relate to me and be a fan. That, of course, also creates your brand.\u201d\n\nMax Verstappen seen wearing AlphaTauri.

            "content": "Ciao ragazzi,\n\nI hope everyone had a successful January with their investments. My portfolio was shaken by the Deepseek storyline that dragged down NVIDIA by ~20% in one day only. Given that NVIDIA is a very dominant position in my portfolio this month I am lagging behind the SP500. I have not sold a single share of NVIDIA, here is why:\n\nMaybe Deepseek did find a miraculous way to train an AI model at 1/100th of the cost of any other US/EU competitor and nothing will be same\n\nMaybe they used GPUs they were not supposed to have (Singapore?)\n\nMaybe they improperly leveraged OpenAI to cut corners and train their model\n\nThe point is that I (and frankly no one) can be sure and I need to see rock-solid evidence to sell Earth`s best company. Also, another argument that can be made is that cheaper foundational models will democratize the application layer shifting the demand from training to inference. To sustain much bigger inference demand, data centers and GPUs will always be needed. Btw the CEOs of Google, Meta, and Microsoft validated my thesis and in recent earning calls after the release of Deepseek models confirmed the ramp-up in expenditure for AI infrastructure.\n\nThis month I share with you my investment thesis about ASML, arguably the best European company together with LVMH.\n\nNew year, new format \u2192 I\u00b4ll get portfolio data directly through a software connected to my account (goodbye Excel for now). This will also factor in dividends in the lifetime (so the lifetime performance of my portfolio is up from last month even if this month was flat). I plan to stop commenting on important market news and just comment on 1 topic here in the intro section.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Performance:\n\nTotal (from 2020) : +109.6%\n\nJan 2025: +0.4%\n\nJan 205 S&P500: +2.7%\n\n\ud83d\udcbc Portfolio overview:\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Sells:\n\nNothing\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Buys:\n\nWhat: ASML\n\nNew/increase: new position\n\nWhy: I admire ASML and have been a fanboy for a couple of years. Finally, I bought it in January. This is a company with a particularly wide moat, let\u00b4s look at it in more detail. Here you go \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nMakers of the most advanced machines to produce semiconductors \ud83c\udfed\n\nASML is a Dutch company that designs and manufactures advanced equipment used in semiconductor chip production. It is the sole supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, essential for producing the most advanced and powerful microchips used in smartphones, data centers, AI, and other high-tech applications. One machine costs $200-250m and it has more than 100,000 components. Some say EUV is one of the most complex engineering feats ever achieved by mankind.\n\nMoat #1 - manipulating natural light \ud83c\udff0\n\nTransistors are printed using a light ray, this is true not only for EUV but for older technologies as well.\n\nTo further miniaturize transistors ASML needed a light source with a much shorter wavelength than natural light (!!)\n\nVisible light has a wavelength of 400-700nm - EUV light of just 13.5nm (this is about this is 5,000x smaller than a human hair)\n\nThe plasma that generates EUV light reaches 220,000\u00b0C (the surface of the Sun is about 5,500\u00b0C)\n\nTo direct and focus EUV light a system of ultra-precise mirrors is used. These mirrors are polished to an accuracy of 0.1 nanometers (1/10,000th the width of a human hair). The mirrors are so perfect that if they were scaled to the size of Germany, the tallest imperfection would be less than 1 mm high.\n\nIf you want to go even deeper \u2192 Link Link\n\nMoat #2 - supply chain \ud83c\udff0\n\nASML masters strategic relationships with its suppliers.\n\nCymer - supplier of the key component to generate light - acquired Zeiss - supplier of precision mirrors - exclusivity agreement and strategic investment from ASML Trumpf - supplier of laser that enables the EUV process - co-development and strategic partnership agreement\n\nMoat #3 - customer relationship\ud83c\udff0\n\nASML develops their machines together with its top customers, an enlightened monopolist, in fact, ASML's joint ventures with Intel, Samsung, and TSMC facilitate the development of next-generation lithography technologies on both sides.\n\nMoat #4 - software \ud83c\udff0\n\nHere are a few software features that I believe constitute another layer of moat:\n\nMachine Control: Precisely manages all aspects of the complex lithography machines.\n\nOverlay: Ensures nanometer-level alignment of chip layers.\n\nComputational Lithography: Corrects for optical distortions, maximizing pattern fidelity.\n\nIf you want to dig deeper \u2192 Link\n\nMarket bound to grow with multiple catalyzators (AI, Defence, Data centers)\n\nWider market for microchips is bound to grow every year for many years to come. In particular, AI infrastructure ramp-up is the driver for the specific type of microchips produced with ASML machines.\n\nRecently all the hyperscalers announced increased investment in AI infrastructure of a combined $350bn in 2025, when in 2024 they were $223bn.\n\nValuation is now more reasonable\n\nAfter a year priced without room for risks or errors, in January valuation multiples caught a break and provided me with an opportunity to buy.\n\nStrong, stable EBITDA - strong, fluctuating FCF margin\n\nEBITDA margin attractive and stable at the ~35% mark. FCF is more fluctuating because of lumpy revenues and collection dates (remember that a single machine can cost $250m)\n\nMultiple risks with different time horizons \ud83d\udc80\n\nShort-term (now) : microprocessor export ban to China \u2192 The company is successfully rebalancing its revenue mix\n\nMedium-term (2030) : in the event that China somehow takes over Taiwan and TSMC is impacted (for example by not being able to export to the US) \u2192 existential risk as TSMC represents ~25% of ASML\u2019s revenues and there is not so much that ASML can do against it, I just have to price it in my judgement\n\nLong-term (2040): Quantum computer technology makes advanced microchips obsolete. Hard to judge but ASML is mitigating this risk by investing in quantum startups \u2192 Link\n\n\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f A quote from a great investor\n\nThe quote: \"The biggest risk of all is not taking one.\" \u2014 Larry Hite\n\nWhat can you learn from it?\n\nRisk is necessary for growth: Avoiding all risks can mean missing out on valuable opportunities.\n\nCalculated risks are key: Smart investing is about managing risk, not avoiding it entirely.\n\nFear can be costly: Over-caution can lead to stagnation, while informed decision-making helps you take advantage of opportunities.\n\nShare Fede's Portfolio\n\nAnd that's it!

Dominique Maitre for WWD\n\n\u201cIn the long term, with the younger generation less inclined to drink alcohol and the reality that some funds cannot have exposure to LVMH shares because of that part of the portfolio, we wouldn\u2019t rule out that once cleaned up, the division might itself be separated from the rest of the group,\u201d said the report, which lists as authors the analysts Erwan Rambourg, Anne-Laure Bismuth and Aurelie Husson-Dumoutier.\n\nTrimming down to pure luxury \u2014 essentially fashion and leather goods, plus watches and jewelry \u2014 \u201ccould give the company a lighter, more coherent portfolio that the market might value more highly.\u201d\n\nShares in LVMH have fallen by about 14 percent over the past year, and on Friday traded at 691 euros. HSBC increased its price target to 888 euros from 850 euros.\n\nAlso on Friday, HSBC changed its outlook on Dior following a recent trip to Paris which gave it some \u201cpositive vibes.\u201d\n\nIt now expects sales at the French fashion house to be flat at constant exchange rates in 2025 versus an earlier forecast of a 4 percent to 5 percent decline this year.\n\nHSBC downplayed the creative renewal playing out at the brand, following the resignation earlier this month of men\u2019s creative director Kim Jones and ubiquitous speculation that Loewe\u2019s Jonathan Anderson will soon be installed at Dior.\n\n\u201cWe see product introductions starting to reverse the sales decline, even before any impact from a new creative direction,\u201d the report said, highlighting the recent introduction of the soft, crossbody handbag known as the D-Journey, \u201cthat seem to be moving the needle.\u201d\n\nThe D-Journey was introduced on the brand\u2019s spring 2025 women\u2019s runway.",

            "content": "Towards the end of January, French luxury behemoth LVMH released its annual report for 2024. The group\u2019s revenue reached 84.7 billion EUR (87.77 billion USD), a 2% year-on-year (YoY) drop in the report but 1% in organic growth, which is higher than expected. Q4 2024 saw a 1% increase in revenue to 23.9 billion EUR (24.76 billion USD). However, the year saw the operating profit and net profit drop 14% and 17% YoY, respectively.\n\nCategory-wise, the fashion and leather goods department and jewellery and watches group both saw a 3% YoY decrease while the wine and liquor brands saw a large drop of 11% YoY. Beauty and fragrance, however, saw a 2% increase, while the selective retailing division, which includes DFS and Sephora grew 2%.\n\nRegion-wise, the United States is growing again with a 3% increase in organic income in Q4, and 2% for 2024. The European market also saw 3% growth while Japan jumped 28%. Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan did not do well, with organic income dropping 10% and 11% for Q4 and the whole year, respectively.\n\nJean-Jacques Guiony, the CEO of Mo\u00ebt Hennessy but LVMH\u2019s CFO for most of last year, described the LVMH fashion and leather goods division as \u201cstable\u201d in China during 2024. The first half was positive, and H2 saw a slight decrease that improved in Q4. Meanwhile, founder, president, and CEO Bernard Arnault notes that the Chinese government has already announced some plans to help with economic growth. Most importantly, LVMH products are still popular in China.\n\nArnault, feeling optimistic about a return to normal within two years after the impact of the pandemic and a property crisis, was reported late last year to be investing in China through the luxury group\u2019s private equity branch. These signs show that China remains an important market for the group, both in term of products and investment.\n\nShare\n\nJoin our newsletter",

            "content": "News\n\nBy Ron Emler\n\nAlexandre Arnault has stepped into the fray, tasked with reviving Mo\u00ebt Hennessy during financial decline. With his father\u2019s retirement looming in 2029, he has two years to prove himself in the LVMH succession battle.\n\nArnault, one of five children by LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, is embroiled in a beauty contest with his siblings to take over the reins when his father\u2019s scheduled retirement comes up in 2029.\n\nAlexandre, 32, this week moved into Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, LVMH\u2018s $6 billion wine and spirits business at a turbulent moment.\n\nIts revenues have fallen substantially over the past two years and the group\u2019s latest figures showed its operating profit plunging by more than a third in 2024 as demand for Cognac and Champagne slumped.\n\n\u2018Give us 100 days\u2019\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, he said: \u201cGive us 100 days to wrap our heads around it and understand the business \u2026 because it\u2019s a business that will need a lot of restructuring.\u201d\n\nAmid speculation that Arnault Senior might be planning major changes, the CEO said: \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get everything back on the growth track. Let\u2019s give them two years to show what they can do.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bernard Arnault did say that he had no intention of selling Mo\u00ebt Hennessy despite being the weakest performing division, accounting for less than 10% of LVMH revenues. Shedding parts of the struggling business was \u201cnot on the agenda\u201d, he said.\n\nAlexandre took over as deputy CEO of the alcohol division this week where the group\u2019s long-serving finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony joined him as chairman to oversee the planned turnaround.\n\nExternal headwinds\n\nAlexandre faces a daunting task. Not only have Cognac sales slumped despite Mo\u00ebt Hennessy\u2019s vigorous discounting in the US to protect its market share, but also there is the prospect of it becoming embroiled in President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff wars.\n\nTrump has threatened to slap imposts on goods entering America from the European Union, a prospect that seems increasingly likely, especially as Brussels has promised to retaliate.\n\nIn addition, the effect of sanctions on Cognac imposed by Beijing will only be heightened if Trump\u2019s newly imposed tariffs on China add to an economic slowdown there.\n\nOn the plus side trade data shows LVMH\u2019s cognac business increased deliveries to the U.S. in December as distributors built up inventories.\n\nArnault Pere and his family have built close ties to Trump, several of them taking prime seats at his inauguration last month.\n\nPraising a \u201cwind of optimism\u201d in the United States, he said last week that LVMH was looking at raising production capacity there.\n\n\n\nRelated news\n\nLVMH strengthens grip on Formula 1 with Belvedere partnership\n\nPharrell Williams debuts Champagne collaboration\n\nLVMH-owned Napa Valley producer closes",

            "content": "LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE has made the decision to sell its stake in the iconic Stella McCartney brand back to the founder, marking the end of a significant partnership. This move comes after more than five years of collaboration, during which Stella McCartney, the daughter of Beatles legend Paul McCartney, built a global reputation for her innovative, sustainable, and animal-free fashion . Known for her bold and environmentally conscious creations, McCartney\u2019s designs have long been a reflection of her commitment to both luxury and ethical fashion.The brand is celebrated for its use of cruelty-free materials, avoiding leather, fur, and feathers, and promoting eco-friendly alternatives such as glue-free sneakers. Stella McCartney\u2019s design philosophy has pushed the boundaries of fashion, combining style with sustainability in a way that has attracted a loyal following among celebrities and eco-conscious consumers alike. McCartney herself will continue to advise LVMH on sustainability matters, ensuring that her voice remains a guiding force in the luxury fashion industry.The decision to sell the stake comes at a time when the global luxury market is facing a slowdown, especially in markets like China. This has led LVMH to focus its attention on refining its portfolio, with the sale of the Off-White label and the closure of select stores as part of this strategy. Yet, Stella McCartney remains a standout example of how fashion can be both luxurious and ethically responsible, making her brand's return to full ownership by its founder a powerful statement.The Stella McCartney brand, with its designs that range from tailored suiting to bohemian-inspired dresses, continues to push the envelope on what it means to be a sustainable luxury label. With sales of around \u00a340 million (INR 4,100 million) in 2022, McCartney's creations continue to captivate those who crave high fashion without compromising their values. Her work has become a symbol of how the fashion industry can evolve with responsibility at its core, and with this new chapter, Stella McCartney is poised to continue reshaping the future of eco-conscious fashion.",

            "content": "MILAN \u2014 Not even a year had gone by between when former Flos B&B Italia Group chief executive Daniel Lalonde unveiled what he referred to as the retail \u201cLVMH of Home,\u201d and unexpectedly stepped down in January.\n\nThe 25,000-square-foot space on New York City\u2019s 135 Madison Avenue that Lalonde was referring to opened last year and finally brought B&B Italia, Flos, Louis Poulsen, Maxalto, Arclinea and Azucena together under one roof.\n\nSources close to the situation told WWD that Lalonde parted ways with the company after disagreements on restructuring plans. Sources also said the group has entertained informal offers.\n\nOne source said that Holland, Mich.-based Haworth \u2014 which owns fellow furniture and lighting brands Poltrona Frau, Cappellini, Cassina, Janus et Cie, Luminaire, Ceccotti Collezioni, Karakter, Luxury Living Group, Interni and Zanotta \u2014 made an offer of between 800 million euros and 1 billion euros for Flos B&B Italia\u2019s furniture division. The furniture arm of the Italy-based conglomerate includes vanguard brands B&B Italia, Maxalto, Denmark-based Audo Copenhagen, Azucena and kitchen brand Arclinea. The offer was refused, as it was deemed too low.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nHaworth declined to comment. Flos B&B Italia Group could not be reached for comment.\n\nIndustry observers believe that splitting the group\u2019s furniture and lighting business would not be illogical, but it\u2019s not clear if the aim is to sell the whole company or parts of it \u2014 or that it is actively shopping for a buyer.\n\nFurnishings by Maxalto. Courtesy of Maxalto\n\nIn January, Flos B&B Italia Group, formerly known as Design Holding, said in a statement that former Flos CEO Piero Gandini was appointed its executive chairman \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d but that Lalonde will \u201cremain a member of the board of directors of the group to support the future development of the business.\u201d The release did not provide additional details and did not name a new CEO.\n\nMarket leaders here say the appointment of Gandini makes sense, especially to lead the lighting division, which includes Copenhagen-based Louis Poulsen, should the furniture business be sold, separate from lighting.\n\nGandini, according to market insiders, was a well-regarded executive with decades of experience in the lighting sector. Gandini left Flos as its longtime CEO and chairman in 2019 and is the son of the lighting firm\u2019s first manager Sergio Gandini, who started at the helm in its early heyday in 1963 and later bought it in 1964. Flos was founded in Merano, Italy, in 1962 and boasts an extensive catalogue of iconic lamps created by legendary design names \u2014 Philippe Starck, Patricia Urquiola, Ron Gilad, Michael Anastassiades and Vincent Van Duysen among them.\n\nDaniel Lalonde Mattia Zoppellaro\n\nLalonde was key in developing a unique strategy that aimed at bringing the group\u2019s vanguard brands B&B Italia, Flos, Louis Poulsen, Maxalto, Arclinea and Azucena under one roof in new spaces worldwide. At the time of the New York opening, he told WWD the group was on track to meet its near-term goal of 1 billion euros in sales.\n\nLalonde also said it was the first time major luxury European furniture and lighting brands stood together, making it easier for customers to build the home of their dreams.\n\nFlos joined Design Holding in 2018 when funds Investindustrial and the Carlyle Group formed the holding company. Roberta Silva was named Flos\u2019 CEO in 2019. Silva stepped down in 2024.\n\nIn 2021, the Italian conglomerate inked a joint venture with Fendi to form Fashion Furniture Design, or FF Design, to develop the Fendi Casa business. The line was previously produced and distributed by licensee Luxury Living, operating through Club House Italia.\n\nIn its 2025 M&A report, PwC said the volume of deals greater than $1 billion in value increased by 17 percent in 2024 and sees the market gaining momentum later in the year.\n\nIn Italy, PwC said there was an 18 percent decline in M&A deals in 2024 \u2014 in-line with the rest of Europe. Throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa, deal values, however, increased by 15 percent over the same period. \u201cM&A in consumer markets in EMEA has been weighed down by inflation and macroeconomic conditions, as well as by the proximity of two wars that created greater macroeconomic uncertainty in the region,\u201d it said.\n\nIn a surprise deal in the second half of 2024, Nemo Group, owned by Milan-based lighting entrepreneur Federico Palazzari, turned itself into a lighting and furniture group by adding two crown jewels to its growing design hub of brands with the acquisition of lighting maker Fontana Arte and Driade, its first furniture property. Deals of this nature, allowing groups to complete the home with luxury kitchens, lighting and furniture, are expected to rise into 2025.",

Japan, a key market in the region, contributed 6%.\n\nLVMH cited slowing Chinese consumer spending as a major reason for the downturn. The company noted that cognac sales were particularly affected by \u201cweak local demand in China and a challenging market environment in the United States.\u201d\n\nOutlook for 2025\n\nLooking ahead, LVMH signaled a cautious approach to 2025, citing market uncertainties. The company said it will focus on cost control, enhancing consumer experiences, and maintaining its sustainability strategy to reinforce its position as a leader in luxury wines and spirits.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nDiscover more from Vino Joy News Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.",

In addition, the state of China's economic challenges have vastly impacted the market, as it once was the company\u2019s star regional customer.\n\nPerson Pouring Cocktail on Clear Drinking Glass Photo by Magda Ehlers via Pexels\n\nDespite a small decline, the Champagne brands of LVMH maintained a market share of more than 22 percent of all Champagne-appellation shipments. But, cognac and other types of spirits' sales continuously dropped from former years.\n\nEven though the company\u2019s Wine and Spirits Maison hasn\u2019t been profitable for the past couple of quarters, they\u2019ve continued to invest in the industry, launching exclusive editions, limited-time products, and creating collaborations in an effort to get the sector back on track.\n\nIn the next two years, they expect this decreasing industry to recover and have employed a new team to heavily focus on the turnaround of the business.\n\nFor the first time, LVMH enters sober market\n\nAfter several failed investments in its Wine and Spirits Maison in an effort to salvage it, LVMH made the decision to enter a new market.\n\nIn October of 2024, in a press release , LVMH announced that they would be partnering with French Bloom, a non-alcoholic sparkling wine, which makes it their first investment in an alcohol-free beverage.\n\nIn 2023, in the U.S., the alcohol-free wine market increased by 18 percent and it\u2019s expected to expand annually by double digits. That growth is mostly driven by higher-price brands, accounting for 87 percent of the increase, according to an IWSR study .\n\nThat might just be the change LVMH needs to reverse declining sales since the alcohol-free drink market has increased to shocking figures because of its rise in demand by the sober-curious and sober.\n\nBut, LVMH isn\u2019t the only entity entering the alcohol-free drink sector; alcoholic drink companies, such as Diageo and Molson Coors, also have launched new items that appeal to this profitable sector, which creates more competition that\u2019s only expected to increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49Follow Kristen on Newsbreak here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

LVMH owns 75 luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, and Tiffany & Co. It is the only group whose subsidiaries span all five sectors of the luxury goods market: wines and spirits, fashion and leather goods, perfumes and cosmetics, watches and jewelry, and selective retailing.\n\nHistory LVMH began in 1987 when Henri Recamier, then the head of Louis Vuitton, announced the merger of his company with Mo\u00ebt Hennessy. The latter was itself a merger, formed in 1971 between Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, a historic producer of champagne known especially for Dom Perignon, and Hennessy, a leading producer of cognac. Three years later Recamier was ousted from the company in a hostile takeover by Bernard Arnault, who became chairman and CEO of LVMH. Arnault focused on increasing LVMH\u2019s growth by acquiring existing companies and brands in various luxury sectors, including the French fashion houses Christian Lacroix, Givenchy, and Kenzo; the leather goods companies Loewe, Celine, and Berluti; the jeweler Fred Joaillier; the duty-free chain DFS Group; and the beauty retailer Sephora. He pursued this strategy so effectively that LVMH\u2019s revenue increased 500 percent from 2005 to 2022, when it also announced annual profits of over \u20ac20 billion.\n\nFashion LVMH has nurtured a reputation for promoting creativity and artistic talent in the fashion market. In a 2014 interview with the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, Pierre-Yves Roussel, then the CEO of the LVMH fashion group, described how the company sought out creatives who were able to innovate and keep iconic products relevant. Indeed, one such creative, Marc Jacobs, reinvigorated the classic Louis Vuitton handbag by collaborating with designer Stephen Sprouse and with the Japanese visual artist Takashi Murakami. The former successfully marketed the Speedy graffiti handbag (2001), which looked as if it had been spray-painted with the company\u2019s name, and the latter produced the critically acclaimed Eye Love Monogram collection (2003), which replaced the brand\u2019s traditional beige-and-brown monogrammed canvas with a multicolored palette featuring pop-art graphics, such as cartoon eyes. LVMH is also known for having cultivated the talents of such designers as John Galliano, Virgil Abloh, and Phoebe Philo. In 2014 Arnault\u2019s daughter, Delphine Arnault, then the Louis Vuitton executive vice president, launched the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers, which grants one fashion design graduate \u20ac300,000 and supports the development of the winner\u2019s company.",

By committing such vast sums to the sport for the next decade, LVMH is reinforcing the idea of F1 as an aspirational sport that appeals to a wealthy demographic.\n\n\u201cWith F1 long having been seen to be an elite sport, brands partnering with it are looking to capitalize on that demographic.\u201d\n\nIn January, watch brand Tag Heuer was unveiled as F1\u2019s new timekeeping partner supplanting Rolex, while fashion house Louis Vuitton has become an official F1 partner and the title partner of the 2025 season-opening Australian Grand Prix.\n\nLouise Deglise-Favre, GlobalData Apparel analyst, added: \u201cFormula 1 has experienced a significant rise in popularity in recent years, attracting a new and diverse audience, notably through Drive to Survive.\n\n\u201cAs a result, many brands, especially within the premium and luxury segments have been interested in capitalizing on this success and gaining exposure through partnerships. For example, before the deal between LVMH and Formula 1, brands such as Hugo Boss and Tommy Hilfiger partnered with Formula 1 racing teams Aston Martin Racing and Mercedes-AMG respectively.\u201d",

Its links to the series, though, date back to the inaugural world championship season in 1950 when Paul Chandon-Mo\u00ebt and his cousin, Count Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chandon de Briailles, invited Juan Manuel Fangio to share a toast following the Argentine\u2019s French Grand Prix victory.\n\nAll three of the brands named in the original partnership announcement between Formula One and LVMH have now been given their official designations, following Tag Heuer and Louis Vuitton. Mo\u00ebt & Chandon replaces Ferrari Trento, which served as the series\u2019 official sparkling wine.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether more brands will be unveiled in the coming weeks. The initial Formula One announcement said the deal would include \u2018several of LVMH\u2019s iconic maisons\u2019, hinting at possibly more than just the three named brands.\n\nComment:\n\n\u201cThe tradition of toasting on the podium is one of the most iconic moments in our sport and we\n\nare thrilled to welcome once again Mo\u00ebt & Chandon as the official champagne of Formula One,\u201d said Stefano Domenicali, president and chief executive of Formula One.\n\n\u201cThis partnership celebrates the history, emotion and excellence that bind Formula One and Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, in a perfect union of performance and refinement in a truly special year that sees us celebrate our 75th anniversary.\n\n\u201cThe return of Mo\u00ebt & Chandon to the podium strengthens further the bond of our innovative partnership with LVMH and we cannot wait to toast this extraordinary collaboration together.\u201d\n\nSibylle Scherer, chief executive and president of Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, added: \u201cWe are honoured and excited to return as the official champagne of Formula One, celebrating a shared history of collective triumph and dedication since the 1950s.\n\n\u201cWe honour the extraordinary teamwork, the unlimited precision, and the pursuit of excellence that drive both motorsport and our craft. This partnership is a tribute to the unity and shared achievements of inspiring drivers, their devoted teams, and the global community that rallies behind them.\n\n\u201cAs Mo\u00ebt & Chandon takes its place on the podium once again, we proudly continue to craft moments of celebration that belong to everyone committed to this incredible journey.\u201d\n\nComing next:\n\nMo\u00ebt & Chandon will title sponsor the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps when it takes place from 25th to 27th July.\n\nLooking to unlock more exclusive insights and strategic connections in the motorsport industry?\n\nThe BlackBook Motorsport Forum is the destination that connects and inspires top decision-makers and leaders across global motorsport.

            "content": "LVMH\u2019s watch and jewellery division recorded a 3 percent fall in revenues last year as the watch industry suffered its most challenging period since the pandemic. But at the sixth edition of LVMH Watch Week, held in New York and Paris in late January, the chief executives of the group\u2019s watchmakers put on a brave face.\n\n\u201cWe believe as a group that there is high potential in our watch brands,\u201d said Jean-Christophe Babin, chief executive of Bulgari, who claimed his watch division had experienced double-digit growth last year. (LVMH does not disclose results by brand.) Babin said LVMH Watch Week signalled the group\u2019s watchmaking ambitions.\n\n\u201cFor LVMH, it\u2019s a clear strategic decision to become a major watch player,\u201d he said.\n\nThe number of exhibiting brands increased this year from six to nine. Specialist watchmakers Bulgari, TAG Heuer, Hublot, Zenith, Gerald Genta and Daniel Roth were joined by Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co and L\u2019Ep\u00e9e 1839, the Swiss clockmaker whose parent company Swiza was acquired by LVMH last summer.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cLVMH Watch Week is the perfect vehicle for launching a new collection,\u201d said Louis Vuitton\u2019s director of watches Jean Arnault. \u201cTwo years ago, we set this event as a target for launching these new watches, and we made it.\u201d The company released more than a dozen new high-end watches into its Tambour collection, including a \u201cmontre \u00e0 guichet\u201d, or aperture watch, called Tambour Convergence and several watches featuring its signature \u201cSpin Time\u201d complication.\n\nNicolas Beau, vice president of Tiffany Horlogery, said he too had wanted a full collection ready before joining the event, which he described as \u201can ideal launchpad.\u201d Among the highlights of the American brand\u2019s first watch collection since Beau joined the company in 2021 was the $590,000 Carat 128 Aquamarine Watch, a one-of-a-kind creation inspired by the legendary Tiffany Diamond, which sold during the week in New York.\n\n\u201cThe power of the group is good at an event like this, just as when we need to exchange ideas and savoir-faire,\u201d he said.\n\nAntoine Pin, who was appointed TAG Heuer chief executive in September, said LVMH Watch Week helped put the group\u2019s watchmakers on a level playing field with its fashion brands. \u201cThe group is not as famous for its watchmaking as it is for fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this event shows the group is really taking watchmaking seriously.\u201d\n\nAccording to Julien Tornare, who moved from TAG Heuer to take over as chief executive of Hublot, the success of the event is attracting attention. \u201cWe\u2019re receiving more and more requests from brands outside the group that would love to be part of it,\u201d he said, adding there were no plans to open up the event.\n\nLVMH Watch Week had been planned for Los Angeles. The US market has been a rare highlight for watchmakers over the past 12 months, with exports to the country up 5 per cent on 2023, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry (FHS).\n\nBut following the devastating effects of wildfires that destroyed 16,000 homes and buildings worth an estimated $30 billion across the city, the decision was taken to postpone and split the event. Brands hosted media and some clients in their own boutiques and offices in New York and Paris, or in LVMH-owned properties, such as the five-star Cheval Blanc hotel in the French capital.\n\n\u201cEthically, it wasn\u2019t appropriate to go to Los Angeles at that time, which was really bad for many people,\u201d said Babin. \u201cIt was much better to postpone to next year.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBabin said this had meant the cost of reorganising the event was \u201calmost zero\u201d and that the group was looking to cover its losses from the cancellation of the LA event by deferring venue bookings to next year.\n\nWhile brand chief executives said they hoped next year\u2019s event would return to a single-location format, Babin said the change of venue did open the doors to European and Middle Eastern clients \u201cthat didn\u2019t want to go to LA.\u201d\n\nAccording to one analyst, LVMH Watch Week was unlikely to spark a revival for the group or the luxury watch industry, following a difficult year. \u201cI expect the watches recovery to take time,\u201d said Luca Bernstein, managing director of global luxury goods at Bernstein. \u201cA lot of demand was brought forward and the category is purchased infrequently. And the LVMH brands lag behind in terms of consumer desirability.\u201d\n\nOliver M\u00fcller, founder of the Swiss consultancy LuxeConsult, agreed that LVMH Watch Week was an indicator of the group\u2019s plans to catch its watchmaking rivals Richemont, Swatch Group and Rolex. \u201cBeing in fourth place in the Swiss watch industry has never been seen as fulfilling LVMH\u2019s ambitions as the number one of the luxury industry overall,\u201d he said. \u201cHence the group has chosen to go full speed on its watch division\u2019s projects.\u201d\n\nLVMH Watch Week was the first time the group\u2019s watch brands had come together publicly since chief executive Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault announced plans to streamline the division\u2019s operations in November last year. LVMH brands have quietly shared movements and facilities for years, but the announcement indicated a rapid acceleration of the strategy and signalled the group\u2019s intention to adopt a more open communications policy around it.\n\nIn New York and Paris, Bulgari introduced a new automatic movement for its ladies\u2019 Serpenti Seduttori watch. Initially, the movement will be produced in the low thousands of units by Bulgari, but according to Babin it will migrate to Zenith\u2019s watchmaking facilities where it will be industrialised.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have economy of scale unless we accept to pool resources,\u201d said Babin. \u201cThis is really the first major pooling decision we made.\u201d Babin said that unlike at rival Swatch Group, where brands are tiered by price point, LVMH\u2019s stable compete in similar price segments, meaning the development and manufacturing costs of the movement could be amortised collectively.\n\nIt also gave the group another advantage, Babin noted. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that the sister brands we have in the watch division are also very much interested by the ladies market,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an underdeveloped market, and this movement is key to succeeding in it. Because for women, [a watch] is not only a matter of design, it\u2019s a matter of overall integrity.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTAG Heuer used LVMH Watch Week to push a collection of Formula 1 chronographs priced around $5,000, the first products it has released since the announcement earlier this month that it had signed a deal with Formula 1\u2019s owners Liberty Media to become the sport\u2019s official timekeeper. The deal, which also includes LVMH brands Louis Vuitton and Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, is reported to be worth $1 billion over 10 years, more than half of which is thought to be covered by the Swiss watchmaker.\n\nIt\u2019s expected TAG Heuer will release a collection of more accessible watches into its Formula 1 collection at Watches and Wonders Geneva, the industry\u2019s leading watch show. LVMH Watch Week is timed to get ahead of a six-week embargo imposed on brands exhibiting at Watches and Wonders Geneva, which begins on April 1 and where 60 brands will exhibit to an expected 50,000 visitors.\n\n\u201cWatches and Wonders will be a bigger moment than this one,\u201d said Tornare, noting that Hublot will focus on the 20th anniversary of its Big Bang, the design that has defined its growth over the past two decades.\n\nBulgari will exhibit at the event for the first time having initially decided not to join Hublot, TAG Heuer and Zenith in Geneva after Baselworld, once the world\u2019s largest watch and jewellery fair, collapsed during the pandemic.\n\nBabin said he was joining the fair because LVMH was now represented on the Watches and Wonders Geneva Foundation board and because the organisers had granted him and his fellow LVMH watch brands prime positions at the show. \u201cThe important step was the acceptance of the fact that Bulgari is an important watchmaker, and as such would have a location and a space consistent with what the brand stands for,\u201d he said. During previous editions, Bulgari had taken a space in Geneva\u2019s President Wilson hotel. Babin said the investment required to exhibit at the fair was twice what he had paid to be in the hotel.\n\nTornare said LVMH Watch Week set a benchmark. \u201cIt shows the other divisions that we can do successful events between brands,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes we consider ourselves competitors, sometimes sister brands. But at the end of the day, we can do something all together and do a good job.\u201d",

Accounting for less than 10% of LVMH group sales, the unit is vulnerable to trade tensions.\n\n\n\nTrade data shows LVMH's cognac business increased deliveries to the U.S. in December as distributors built up inventories.\n\nFrance's luxury groups were hit in Trump's first presidential term when he targeted champagne and handbags over a French digital services tax he decided would harm U.S. firms.\n\n\n\n\"Whilst we continue to believe that the U.S. spirits market will recover further, tariffs bring short-term uncertainty,\" wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nBernard Arnault and members of his family have cultivated personal ties with Trump. Bernard, his wife Helene Mercier, Alexandre, and daughter Delphine, who runs , sat right behind America's former presidents at Trump's inauguration.\n\nPraising a \"wind of optimism\" in the United States, Bernard Arnault said last week that LVMH was looking at raising production capacity there.\n\n\n\nAlexandre took over as deputy CEO of the alcohol unit on Monday, alongside long-time LVMH finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony, an industry veteran. Alexandre marked the change on his Instagram account with a post showing he was heading to one of LVMH's grand cru estates in Burgundy.\n\n\n\nShedding parts of the struggling business was \"not on the agenda\", Bernard Arnault said last week in response to recent speculation LVMH could revisit its ties to , which holds a minority stake in the drinks division. He said he would keep a close eye on the next moves from his son and Guiony.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sure they'll get everything back on the growth track. Let's give them two years to show what they can do,\" Bernard Arnault, 75, said.\n\n\n\nAlexandre is expected to draw on his experience from previous executive roles at German suitcase maker Rimowa and U.S. jeweller Tiffany & Co, where his missions were to revive somewhat ageing brands, freshly acquired by LVMH.\n\n\n\nAt Tiffany, he grabbed headlines with a buzzy ad campaign featuring Beyonce and while shaking up the nearly 200-year-old brand's image with a controversial new slogan: \"Not Your Mother's Tiffany\". The brand's end-of-year performance showed some signs of improvement, analysts said.\n\n\n\nLVMH has struggled to find growth in its high-end wine and spirits after several years of high inflation in Western economies and as younger drinkers shift to mixed and non-alcoholic drinks.\n\n\n\n\"It's a business with less growth expectations than other parts of the company, the difficulties are here to stay\", Barclays analyst Carole Madjo told Reuters.",

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nLVMH's tariff exposure\n\nAs a global seller of a wide range of goods -- including cosmetics, fashion pieces, alcohol, and jewelry -- that considers China a major market, investors likely worried that LVMH would get hit in any trade war that materializes. Before announcing the pauses, the U.S. had imposed 10% tariffs on goods imported from China and 25% rates on goods from Canada and Mexico, shaking up global markets. President Trump has also threatened to levy an import tax on the European Union.\n\nOn the company's earnings call last week, CEO Bernard Arnault framed Trump's election as a positive for the company, saying he observed \"the momentum of optimism in the country\" following a visit to the U.S., and that LVMH would get subsidies to build production facilities there.\n\nCanada and Mexico are not major markets for LVMH, but China is, and Asia, excluding Japan, was its biggest source of revenue last year at 23.3 billion euros, so any impact on the Chinese economy could affect LVMH stock as well.\n\nAs a seller of luxury products, LVMH also seems at risk of tariff-induced price increases because these aren't products that consumers need, and they can find substitutes for, say, a bottle of Moet champagne or a Louis Vuitton handbag if the price is too high.\n\nThe tariff uncertainty also comes after LVMH posted disappointing fourth-quarter earnings last week, with the stock falling on weak results that included just 1% organic revenue growth as the company continued to face challenges in China and with the broader global macroeconomic climate.\n\nWhat's next for LVMH\n\nThe fortunes of the world's largest luxury goods company are closely tied to the global economy, and growth is likely to be challenged if a trade war flares. Given the current facts on the ground, 2025 is shaping up to be a difficult year for the luxury stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A major stakeholder in the French Pavilion in Osaka, LVMH and five of its Maisons \u2013 Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Chaumet and Mo\u00ebt Hennessy \u2013 will spotlight excellence and craftsmanship with a high-profile presence in both the permanent and temporary exhibition spaces.\n\nThe launch event took place on Tuesday, February 4 at the Cit\u00e9 de l'Architecture et du Patrimoine in Paris, attended by French President Emmanuel Macron, the Minister Delegate for Foreign Trade and French Nationals Abroad Laurent Saint-Martin, Minister of Culture Rachida Dati and Japanese Ambassador France Makita Shimokawa. A highlight of the conference was the introduction of the quartet of ambassadors of the French Pavilion, who were on hand for the event and who are all close friends of LVMH Maisons: Sophie Marceau, Antoine Dupont, Teddy Riner and L\u00e9a Seydoux. They will represent France during key celebratory moments at the Pavilion.\n\nFollowing the success of the Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024, the French Pavilion will promote France internationally at the 2025 World Expo. This ambition resonates perfectly with LVMH\u2019s core mission, \"Savoir Faire R\u00eaver\", The Art of Crafting Dreams, leading the Group to partner with the event. LVMH has maintained close ties with Japan for many years and is one of the country's leading private sector French employers, counting more than 14,000 employees (out of 215,000 worldwide) and a network of a thousand stores in the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe partnership between LVMH and the French Pavilion at the Osaka 2025 World Expo is an exceptional opportunity to further highlight excellence, exemplary performance, heritage and innovation, all defining values of the unique French savoir-faire for which our Maisons are renowned. Japan holds a special place in the heart of the LVMH Group. For decades, we have together celebrated a love of heritage and nature through the dialogue of cultures and respect for local identities. This is how, year after year, we forge increasingly strong and harmonious ties,\u201d commented Bernard Arnault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the LVMH group.\n\n\n\nJacques Maire, Chairman of COFREX and Commissioner General for France Osaka 2025, unveiled the theme and guiding thread of the Pavilion, \"A Hymn to Love\" and its powerful messages, resonating as a promise of the future thanks to a compelling immersive exhibition featuring unique and bold scenography, coupled with a rich and engaged program.\n\n\n\nLouis Vuitton and Dior will host two spaces in the heart of the permanent exhibition, welcoming and inspiring nearly three million visitors, more than 20,000 each day. Two other LVMH Maisons, Celine and Chaumet will also contribute to the success of the Pavilion by joining the temporary exhibition space. What\u2019s more, Mo\u00ebt Hennessy will be the hospitality partner of the French Pavilion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the permanent exhibition from April 13 to October 13:\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Louis Vuitton retraces its history in an ode to craftsmanship and Japan, conceived with Japanese architect Shohei Shigematsu from the firm OMA. The first room will feature a \u201clibrary\u201d of 85 trunks and celebrate exceptional savoir-faire within the soundscape of a workshop, reinterpreted by IRCAM. The second room will transport visitors into a dreamlike world where a \"geode of trunks\" will come to life within a surrounding video installation by Japanese artist Daito Manabe.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 \u00b7 Maison Dior dreams up a fabulous odyssey, a homage to the love of craftsmanship and savoir-faire. The visit will open with three variations of the timeless Dior Bar suit in blue, white, and red, while a monumental installation will present the iconic white toiles alongside iconic Dior perfume bottles: Miss Dior, J\u2019adore, Diorissimo... The scenography by Nathalie Crini\u00e8re will be punctuated by works by designer Tokujin Yoshioka and photographs by Yuriko Takagi. A tribute to excellence and the powerful ties forged between Dior and Japan.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 As hospitality partner, Mo\u00ebt Hennessy will propose a selection of wines and champagnes on the \"bistro\" menu and during special Pavilion events.\n\n\n\nFrom April 13 to May 12, 2025, in the temporary exhibition space:\n\n\n\nCeline celebrates its craftmanship and its strong ties with Japanese culture & know-how, through a dialogue between \u201cUrushi\u201d, the local traditional lacquer, and the Parisian house\u2019s emblem, the \u201cTriomphe\u201d. Throughout the month, the exhibition will showcase the work of visual artists Soshi Nakamura and Hikoju Maki-e, as well as exclusive maroquinerie pieces.\n\n\n\nFrom September 1st to October 13, 2025, in the temporary exhibition space:\n\n\n\nA naturalist jeweler for over 240 years, Chaumet will take visitors on a sensory journey centered on its emblematic honeycomb cell, through which the Maison celebrates its love for the beauty and vitality of nature.\n\n",

At the time, LVMH spokespeople explained he was \u201cpursuing another mission in the group.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn an impressive career, Brunschwig had previously spent almost a decade at Christian Dior, ending as president of Dior Homme. Prior to that, he had been CEO of Celine, joining from Louis Vuitton, where he was director general for nearly four years. That came after two years as CEO of yet another LVMH company, Sephora.\n\n\u201cAlways the unexpected since 1854. This is Louis Vuitton\u2019s promise, leader of a luxury industry driven by this goal, as reveals its Latin etymology \u201cluxus\u201d: luxation, extravagance... This is the world I was fortunate to enter when meeting Bernard Arnault (LVMH CEO) as a consultant in 1992 to help him restructure champagne division, following (the) first Gulf War crisis,\u201d wrote Brunschwig in his posting.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese almost thirty years have been an extraordinary journey through LVMH treasures: Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Sephora, Celine. A series of exceptional encounters with people with spark in their eyes, passion for their maison, starting with artisans and sales associates. An apprenticeship of infinite exigence: the main enemy of every brand and every manager is success. Managing crisis is basic, managing success, ego, hubris,\u201d added Brunschwig, a 1984 graduate of elite Paris college Science Po, who then cut his management teeth at McKinsey & Company.\n\n\n\nHis posting was greeted with scores of compliments by fellow contacts and professionals.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to thank all my collaborators in every Maison and all my bosses through all these years : late Yves Carcelle, Sidney Toledano, Toni Belloni, Pierre Letzelter, Pierre-Yves Roussel.

In a recent fireside chat, we explored how, as the world\u2019s largest luxury conglomerate, LVMH stays relevant in the face of changing demographics and rapidly evolving trends.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, maintaining relevance involves ensuring that LVMH brands uphold great consistency in the face of competition, which, in turn, encourages a broader and less constrained sense of creativity.\n\nTo stay relevant, get creative\n\nHeritage is at the heart of luxury brands and a significant aspect of their allure. Even so, it needs to be interpreted \u2013 and reinterpreted \u2013 to reflect the times. One of the complexities of managing luxury brands relates to the articulation of heritage vs. modernity. That is where creativity comes in.\n\nAt LVMH, heritage is presented in a modern way through creativity around its three pillars: product design, storytelling and client experience. But for a business group with over 75 luxury brands, there is no standard model.\n\nIn practice, creativity needs to be delegated to the people close to the business and the customers. This means that individual brands and business units within the group must have the autonomy to make decisions \u2013 from products to distribution, manufacturing and other support functions. In-store experience cannot be replaced, but in the age of online shopping, creativity helps create value for the customers beyond a mere transaction. In other words, it is about establishing a memorable customer experience.\n\nOf course, the balance between heritage and creativity varies with the product category. Take luxury watches and fine wines, where many classics are not expected to evolve significantly. Even if little creativity is required in the design of these luxury products, creative storytelling is much needed, as exemplified in the storytelling mastery of luxury watch maker Patek Philippe.\n\nLeveraging technology for creativity and growth\n\nIn fashion and luxury, the age of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought data analytics to a new level. This can potentially boost creativity and growth. Through the smart management of large pools of data, AI can play an important role in the development of products \u2013 even the art of cognac making, which is traditionally the domain of trained professionals.\n\nAt Hennessy, for example, cognac-making involves a team of seven members tasting over 30 samples every day to arrive at their joint evaluation. While the large volumes of data produced daily is beyond human capabilities to analyse, perhaps AI could one day overcome human limitations by creating relationships and rules to document the complexity of the different taste profiles. Today, this is not yet a reality. But the possibility of leveraging AI to further knowledge in a domain traditionally dependent on human expertise refined over years is an exciting prospect.\n\nAI \u2013 when associated with other technologies such as virtual reality \u2013 is also a game changer in the world of fashion, not by replacing in-store experience, but enabling consumers to \u201cexperience\u201d different products before even stepping into a store. AI tools can help customers identify products that fit them well and allow brands to personalise their recommended products to individual customers. The effectiveness of such features is highly dependent on whether brands succeed in creating truly representative avatars of the consumer in three-dimension.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) can also be a powerful marketing tool when associated with an actual product (be it existing or future). Just picture this: If an exclusive bottle of Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Yquem were to be introduced, creating NFTs of the bottle could generate interest, ahead of the launch, in the exquisite Sauternes wine \u2013 the only Premier Cru Sup\u00e9rieur in its category \u2013 and its unique bottle.\n\nFundamentally, brands should embrace AI and other technologies with creativity if they want to enhance the value of the brand and the group, bearing in mind that value may not always directly be of a financial nature. These tools can bring intangible benefits, such as enhancing storytelling and increasing brand equity. Creativity, facilitated by technology, takes time before financial benefits materialise. Luxury has a long time horizon, so it is uniquely positioned to benefit from the positive effects of creativity.\n\nStrategies for staying relevant\n\nIn the quest to keep their products relevant, companies must look beyond product offerings. One way is to create experiences around products and brands that are meaningful and authentic, as Louis Vuitton and LOEWE did. The artistic directors of these LVMH maisons have built complete brand cultural universes. This involves crafting consistent narratives, brand identities and sets of values that resonate with target audiences and differentiate the brand \u2013 such as causes that their customers and audiences can connect with. This is very salient in the case of Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior\u2019s creative director since 2016, who marries fashion with empowering women and girls in their local communities.\n\nGoing a step further into the future, brands can build brand equity and relevance among their potential customers. For example, Sephora readily gives away samples to students visiting their stores. Even if these students may lack purchasing power today, their positive experience and exposure to Sephora products make them more likely to become loyal customers in the future. In other words, brands can enlarge their brand message to a wider audience.\n\nAnother often overlooked element is the people within the organisation. An organisation is a living body nourished by its people, and people are an important part of the company\u2019s culture. In particular, new employees, such as the artistic directors of Louis Vuitton and Dior mentioned earlier, are important actors in shaping the culture by bringing in new ideas and energy to the brand, and eventually driving financial performance.",

            "content": "LVMH Reports Mixed Financial Results For 2024 Despite slight revenue growth, profit per share declines as luxury market reshapes demands.\n\nLVMH, the world's leading luxury goods conglomerate, faced a challenging year as it reported mixed financial results for 2024. While the company's performance saw slightly improved revenue compared to previous forecasts, the overall profit per share took a notable dip, struggling to meet market expectations.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, LVMH reported revenue growth at 1%, when adjusted for non-recurring items such as divestitures and changes due to currency fluctuations. This statistic, though positive, is weighed down by the significant decrease of 17.2% in profit per share across the entire year. Such outcomes highlight a year filled with conflicting metrics, as sales across various segments revealed uneven performance.\n\nParticularly concerning were the Champagne sales under Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, where the company saw sales plummet by 8%, shifting from 66.5 million bottles sold in 2023 to 61.7 million the following year. This decline reflects broader industry challenges, especially within premium beverage markets, leading to worries about how much more the sector can endure without adapting to current consumer demands.\n\nLVMH\u2019s executive team, including recently celebrated chief executive Philippe Schaus, remains optimistic about the company\u2019s adaptability. Nevertheless, the outlook remains guarded as they assess how to gain more traction, especially within segments where there is increasing consumer interest.\n\nThe need for strategic adjustments is pressing. While LVMH\u2019s performance showed resilience with fourth-quarter results being somewhat above predictions, the required shift toward the higher-end luxury market is evident. Analysts noted, \"La demande chinoise reste insuffisante et le groupe n'est pas assez pr\u00e9sent dans le tr\u00e8s haut de gamme, qui semble actuellement plus pris\u00e9.\" This indicates LVMH's struggle to cater effectively to the luxury segment's shifting landscapes, particularly influential markets like China, where growth had previously been substantial.\n\nLooking back to the fiscal results of 2024, it\u2019s clear the ripple effects of changing consumer preferences left marks not only on LVMH but across the luxury market. The balance between maintaining established luxury status and appealing to new wealth-driven segments will be integral for future growth. LVMH\u2019s leadership understands this urgency and is prepared to undertake steps necessary to bridge the existing gaps.\n\nThe financial results served as both a cautionary tale and guidebook for potential paths forward. Even as the luxury market experiences turmoil concerning demand and Global economic conditions, there\u2019s room for growth through innovation and adjusting to market needs. LVMH continues to demonstrate its resilience, but the evolution of their strategy could very well dictate the future of their standing within the highly competitive luxury goods industry.\n\nOverall, as LVMH navigates through the disparities of 2024\u2019s outcomes\u2014ranging from disappointing Champagne sales to modest improvements elsewhere\u2014the company is left to re-evaluate its strategies moving forward. With the global market for luxury continually shifting, staying attuned to consumer desires and trends is key. The year ahead promises to present challenges, but for LVMH, it also holds opportunities to redefine itself within the luxury framework, aiming for brighter horizons amid changing tides.\n\nUnderneath the mixed financial outcomes, the dedication to refinement and excellence remains strong within LVMH; it's this dedication to upholding their prominent status as luxury market leaders which will undoubtedly influence how they approach 2025 and beyond.",

That means that LVMH can cross-promote its TAG Heuer timepieces; its Veuve Cliquot, Ruinart, and Dom P\u00e9rignon champagnes; and Louis Vuitton handbags, luggage, apparel, and watches.\n\nThis partnership provides a unique ability to globally promote multiple lines within the LVMH product spectrum (as mentioned above), and perhaps, there are plans to promote other LVMH brands as well, such as Zenith, Hublot, Bulgari, L\u2019Ep\u00e9e 1839, Tiffany & Co, and many more.\n\nThat breadth of the LVMH line could justify the company taking on such a huge partnership, rumored to total $1 to $1.5 billion over 10 years. However, at such a high cost, it almost has to perform or the cost would exceed the value of the branding and performance marketing results.\n\nIt\u2019s all about results, and Rolex (and perhaps others like Omega), presumably saw the investment cost as too high relative to the predicted ROI (return on investment).\n\nIWC, Tudor, Richard Mille, Girard-Perrgaux, Moser, Casio Edifice, and Bremont all have associations with F1, so it\u2019s not like LVMH has an exclusive because each racing team is still allowed to select its sponsors.\n\nTAG Heuer specifically has a watch named after the F1 and has long been associated with the brand, dating back to when the sport was in its purer form, when arguably the greatest racer of all time, Ayrton Senna, competed.\n\nIf any company can afford the F1 global partnership, it\u2019s LVMH. However, it\u2019s hard to envision it being enough to propel TAG Heuer to overtake its top competitors, especially considering they dropped to the top 15 Swiss watchmaker spot last year, according to the Morgan Stanley luxury watch report.",

PHOTO: AFP\n\nPARIS \u2013 Kim Jones, the menswear designer at Christian Dior Couture, is leaving the struggling LVMH label after seven years in the role.\n\nDior announced the move in a statement on Jan 31, with a spokesperson confirming the 51-year-old British designer\u2019s departure is immediate. The focus will likely now turn to womenswear designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, who has been in that role since 2016.\n\nChristian Dior, LVMH\u2019s second biggest fashion label, was described recently by investment giant Morgan Stanley as the \u201cproblem child\u201d of the French luxury group due to its lack of innovation.\n\nThe label would benefit if Jonathan Anderson, creative director at LVMH brand Loewe, is made a designer at Dior as has been rumoured, analyst Edouard Aubin wrote in a note.\n\nOther analysts have also pointed out the ready-to-wear and haute couture brand may have increased prices too much in recent years, while it was also hurt by a supply chain probe into its Italian operations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see a change, Dior needs a jolt,\u201d Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said following the announcement.\n\nThough LVMH does not break down sales and profit numbers for each of its labels, outgoing chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said recently Dior had underperformed in LVMH\u2019s fashion and leather goods division in the fourth quarter of 2024, amid a lack of demand from China in particular.\n\nThe unit\u2019s biggest label Louis Vuitton outperformed it, he said.\n\nChristian Dior Couture sales fell by 8 per cent to around \u20ac8.7 billion (S$12.2 billion) in 2024, according to HSBC estimates.\n\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a need to reinvent the brand and give it back some freshness,\u201d Mr Guiony said during LVMH\u2019s earnings announcement.\n\nThe comments will likely add to speculation around Chiuri, whom the fashion media has reported is expected to leave Dior in 2025 \u2013 potentially after she unveils a cruise collection in Rome in May. Dior did not immediately reply when asked to comment on Chiuri\u2019s next steps.\n\nChristian Dior is led by Ms Delphine Arnault, 49, the eldest child of LVMH billionaire chief executive Bernard Arnault.\n\nShe took over two years ago, after former CEO Pietro Beccari oversaw a period of staggering growth, with the opening of a major flagship store in Paris called 30 Montaigne. Mr Beccari now leads Louis Vuitton.\n\nJones was previously also designing for Fendi, another LVMH label, and left that role in October after four years at the helm.\n\nHe presented his last Dior collection in January in Paris, a show attended by celebrities including English actor Robert Pattinson. Models wore pale pink kimono-like coats adorned with embroidery, as well as bands on their eyes.\n\nMr Bernard Arnault, who normally attends his labels\u2019 shows, was absent.\n\nDior is not the only fashion label to shake up its creative ranks, as high-end brands grapple with a downturn.

The first to publish the numbers were a pair of large European companies, ASML and LVMH.\n\nASML, a manufacturer of the most advanced chip manufacturing machines, delivered very nice numbers overall.\n\nAlthough ASML was negatively affected by events surrounding the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek at the beginning of the week, the reported numbers were very nice.\n\nThe company's sales grew by a solid 28% year-on-year and profits by roughly 30%.\n\nThe company also tracks new orders, which shows the overall sentiment in the chip sector. But even here, the company beat expectations, winning new orders worth EUR 7,1 billion, while expectations were about half that.\n\nIn addition, the company also issued a nice outlook for the current quarter.\n\n\u2192 If you are interested in this or other analyses of the results of large companies, you can find all the videos in the playlist titled on the XTB channel Results season with XTB.\n\nThe second European company was LVMH, which brings together dozens of luxury brands. In this case, the numbers were worse than ASML's, but it's definitely not a disaster.\n\nLVMH grew slightly year-on-year in organic sales (after removing the impact of exchange rates).\n\nAlthough profit has decreased, management largely attributes this to changes in exchange rates and high employee expenses at the Paris Olympics.\n\nVirtually all regions and segments performed well, with the exception of China and alcohol. China has been experiencing economic difficulties for some time, which has led to lower demand for luxury goods.\n\nDespite the stagnation last year, LVMH sees its future positively and expects 2025 to be definitely better.\n\nThree large American companies also provided us with numbers. The first of them was an electric car manufacturer TeslaIn short, we can say that the company delivered a very weak earnings report.\n\nTesla failed to meet expectations in terms of sales, profits, and even margins.\n\nTotal sales grew by only 2% and car sales even fell by 8%.\n\nHowever, the results as such were saved by Elon Musk on a call with investors, who again promised many things by the end of this year in the area of \u200b\u200bautonomy, robo-taxis and Optimus robots, which pulled the shares up.onec slightly upwards.\n\nHowever, it brought very good numbers Meta, parent company Facebookon, Instagram, Whatsappu, Messengeror Threads.\n\nIn this case, all the important numbers were exceeded. Interestingly, the Reality Labs division, which deals with virtual and augmented reality products, generated a record loss of $5 billion.\n\nFor the entire previous year, losses totaled almost $18 billion.\n\nHowever, Meta issued a slightly worse outlook for the current quarter, but even in this case, a number of positive information was heard on the call with investors.mac\u00ed.\n\nIn short, CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that artificial intelligence will be a great benefit to the company in many areas. That's why he wants to invest $60 billion to $65 billion in servers and other physical infrastructure this year.\n\nActions Targetsonec grew slightly.\n\nThe last interesting company to publish its results was Microsoft.\n\nIn recent years, investors have been looking mainly at the segment cloudon which artificial intelligence is operated. Although this segment achieved a growth of a nice 31%, expectations were even a little higher.\n\nEqually Microsoft also issued a slightly worse outlook, as problems with some suppliers in the area persist cloudu.\n\nThe remaining segments, which include, for example, office products, licenses for Windows, games, security or advertising, however, most of them exceeded expectations, so we can also evaluate the results as solid in this case.\n\nMicrosoft, like Meta, is planning huge capital expenditures this year, expected to total approximately $80 billion.\n\nHowever, shares fell slightly after the results were released, as investors were disappointed by the weaker outlook in the area of cloudof the segment.\n\nIf you are interested in the results of large companies, XTB publishes a summary of the results of around 30 companies on its website four times a year.

However, a 1% organic growth uptick signals an improvement over the 3% decline in Q3. While its key fashion and leather goods division continued to see declines, the company remains optimistic for 2025.\n\nFor the full year, LVMH reported \u20ac84.7 billion in revenue, a 1.7% decline YOY, with fashion and leather goods falling 3%. However, bright spots included watches and jewelry and selective retail, which posted 3% and 7% growth, respectively\u2014mirroring Richemont\u2019s unexpected 10% Q4 surge.\n\nAnother family-led luxury house, Salvatore Ferragamo, also reported earnings this week, facing headwinds in Asia-Pacific. Full-year revenue fell 10.5% to \u20ac1.04 billion, weighed down by a 19.7% drop in Asia-Pacific sales and a 21.2% decline in wholesale. However, select markets like the U.S., Japan, Europe, and Latin America showed resilience.\n\nAs couture and men\u2019s fashion weeks wrap up, the industry shifts its gaze to New York Fashion Week, which kicks off this Thursday, a week earlier than usual. The scheduling shift provides an unusual pause before London Fashion Week, but New York still faces challenges of scale and consistency. Unlike its European counterparts, NYFW has long struggled with designer retention, as many talents migrate to Paris in pursuit of a broader global audience.\n\nThat said, all eyes will be on PVH\u2019s Calvin Klein, which is set to make a high-stakes return to the runway with Veronica Leoni\u2019s debut collection on Feb. 7. This marks a pivotal moment for PVH, which is doubling down on its core brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, while looking to reestablish Calvin Klein\u2019s fashion credibility. The challenge? Striking a balance between high design and commercial viability\u2014bringing back the clout of a designer-led house without veering too far into the artisanal. If successful, it could reignite Calvin Klein\u2019s place in the fashion conversation and set the tone for the brand\u2019s future.\n\nMeanwhile, Kim Jones\u2019 departure from Dior Men has reignited speculation about Jonathan Anderson\u2019s rumored move from Loewe to Dior. All eyes will be on Maria Grazia Chiuri\u2019s upcoming Paris Women\u2019s Fashion Week show for signs of change.\n\nChiuri\u2019s recent couture presentation was nothing short of stunning. With a trajectory spanning Fendi, Valentino, and Dior, she has continuously taken on more responsibility, proving herself to be one of the most valuable leaders in the industry. Whether at Dior or elsewhere, a strong woman designer leading women\u2019s fashion shouldn\u2019t be overlooked\u2014especially in these dynamic times.\n\nThe drivers behind Burberry\u2019s recent success include its decision to lean into outerwear, one of the brand\u2019s signature categories, and a less severe slowdown in China. However, it\u2019s worth noting that holiday price cuts also played a role in boosting sales. Executives remain cautious, acknowledging that the challenges facing the luxury sector remain far from resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nKenneth Richard\n\nChief Impressionist\n\nThe Impression\n\n",

            "content": "LVMH Luxury Goods Sales Rebound Amid U.S. Consumer Confidence American affluent shoppers drive growth in watches and jewelry, revitalizing LVMH's luxury division forecasts for 2025.\n\nLVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury goods conglomerate, is experiencing a resurgence in its watches and jewelry division, marking a noteworthy recovery after several quarters of decline. Reports indicate sales increased by 3% during the latest quarter, a promising sign for the company's luxury market segment, particularly as American consumers drive this optimistic trend.\n\nAccording to executives at LVMH, including Jean-Christophe Babin, CEO of Bulgari, the company has been positively surprised by the start of the year\u2014a period often viewed as challenging for luxury retail. Babin noted, \"I have to say I've been positively surprised by the start of the year,\" illustrating the unexpected increase amid prior struggles.\n\nConsumer spending among affluent Americans, buoyed by renewed confidence following the U.S. presidential election, has emerged as the primary catalyst for this sales rebound. Anthony Ledru, CEO of Tiffany & Co., stated, \"I think it brings clarity and probably a greater consumer confidence,\" underscoring the importance of consumer sentiment within the luxury market.\n\nThe luxury sector is not just resting on its laurels; LVMH brands are actively launching new products and strategies aimed at attracting higher spending clientele. For example, Louis Vuitton has unveiled innovative collections like the \"Tambour Taiko Spin Time,\" which features jumping cubes inspired by traditional airport flap displays, and the stunning \"Gentissima Oursin Fire Opal\" from its G\u00e9rald Genta line, made with orange and red opal gems sourced from Mexican volcanoes.\n\nWhile the U.S. market shines brightly, concerns about potential tariffs loom overhead, particularly those targeted at Swiss-made watches and French luxury items. The Trump administration previously hinted at tariff measures, which could unsettle the luxury goods market. Nevertheless, LVMH executives, accustomed to global tariff negotiations, remain confident. Babin added, \"We have to wait and see what policies are announced before making plans; we're experienced with tariffs and duties globally.\"\n\nThe transformation of Tiffany's flagship storefront on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue highlights LVMH's commitment to upmarket strategies. Under significant investment, the store has been redesigned to feature high-end offerings and exclusive customer experiences. This effort has reportedly paid off, as Tiffany\u2019s same-store sales surged by 9% during the fourth quarter. The introduction of luxury events, along with new product lines called \"icons\" based on historical designs, aims to cater to affluent customers seeking unique luxury items.\n\nAntoine Pin, the CEO of TAG Heuer, speaks of the remarkable impact of their recent partnership with Formula 1, replacing Rolex as the official timekeeper. Pin noticed immediate positive reactions, stating, \"My surprise was...any announcement we're making with F1 is immediately leading to significant reactions.\" This relationship emphasizes the intersection of luxury goods and high-octane sports, creating fresh opportunities for promotional strategies and consumer engagement.\n\nA significant identity shift is also taking place within the luxury jewelry market. Babin remarked on the revolution brought about by the increasing financial independence of women worldwide. He stated, \"Today you have a real gender equality...women's purchasing power is very similar to men's purchasing power, which is a revolution in luxury.\" This shift indicates not only who is buying luxury products but how those purchases are made, with women increasingly treating themselves to high-end jewelry rather than waiting for gifts.\n\nOverall, the luxury market is on the mend, with LVMH at the forefront of this renaissance. By adapting to consumer trends and introducing innovative products, the conglomerate is well-poised for continued success as it navigates challenges like tariffs and competition. With 2025 on the horizon, the optimism among LVMH's brand leaders signals brighter days for luxury consumers and the overarching luxury goods market.",

            "content": "Leclerc And Arnault Clash Over French Taxation Issues Their public feud highlights tensions over corporate taxes and inflation's impact on consumers.\n\nFrance is witnessing a high-stakes public dispute between two of its most influential business figures: Bernard Arnault, CEO of global luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, and Michel-Edouard Leclerc, president of E.Leclerc supermarkets. This spat, ignited on January 31, 2025, revolves around remarks concerning potential job losses tied to proposed increases in corporate taxes as well as national economic strategies.\n\nThe contention started when Leclerc voiced his concerns over Arnault's comments about considering relocating LVMH should tax burdens escalate. During his remarks on LCI, Leclerc stated, \"It\u2019s not necessarily positively impactful to have one of the richest men in France saying, 'If it doesn't work, I'll leave the country.'\" These comments reflected Leclerc's discontent with what he sees as harmful rhetoric from Arnault and underline the fear of job losses resulting from corporate tax strategies.\n\nArnault quickly countered this sentiment with his own statement shared through LVMH's channels. He firmly denied any intentions to relocate the company, asserting, \"I have never said we were going to relocate the LVMH group. This assertion is false.\" He emphasized LVMH's commitment, highlighting the group\u2019s significant employment footprint within France\u2014approximately 200,000 jobs, both directly and indirectly.\n\nThe root of the altercation stems from Arnault's criticism of the French government's plans to impose higher taxes on large corporations, which he argues creates disincentives for domestic operation. Arnault articulated his views: \"What I said is the fiscal measures considered are an incentive to relocate, since they tax Made in France but not French companies relocated.\" His message was clear; he fears the new tax system may penalize companies for producing goods domestically.\n\nDespite the heated exchange, both leaders share fundamental concerns about France's economic future. Arnault reiterated his patriotic sentiments, stating, \"I love France, and I want our country to remain competitive; hence my concerns about what I believe are counterproductive measures.\" His comments drew attention to the broader discussion about the impact of taxation on businesses large and small.\n\nLeclerc did not shy away from the public exchange and, during his interview, discussed not just taxation but also the pressures of rising inflation on consumers and potential pricing strategies. He remarked, \"Inflation from the last three years has truly left its mark. It won\u2019t return as bonuses of -20% or -30% to consumers soon.\" This candid acknowledgment about the state of consumer pricing sets the stage for his vulnerability to shifting economic tides.\n\nThe E.Leclerc executive also pointed to future negotiations with suppliers, stating, \"We\u2019re about to enter negotiation periods where we are receiving pricing from major suppliers.\" While optimistic about addressing some of the pricing issues, he recognized the reality of increasing costs, noting all indications point to hikes rather than reductions.\n\nThis public feud highlights not only the deeply personal stakes involved for both leaders but also the broader socio-economic concerns affecting French consumers. Chastising Arnault indirectly, Leclerc advised, \"He should sell more French products and stop pressuring French suppliers, risking their difficulties by seeking lower prices.\" This reflects broader sentiments not only about corporate responsibility but also about the need for unity among French businesses.\n\nThe larger discourse on France\u2019s economic health could be well served by cooperation rather than conflict\u2014an ideal scenario as these titans engage over the national stage. The question remains: Can leaders like Arnault and Leclerc navigate their differences for the sake of the nation\u2019s competitiveness and consumer welfare? Only time will tell how their public confrontations and negotiations impact the broader French economic environment.",

In its earnings call this week, LVMH reported that sales for its watches and jewelry group increased 3%, after falling in the previous quarters. The division outperformed the company's core fashion and leather goods segment, which was down 1% during the quarter, as well as wine and spirits, which declined 8%. In interviews during LVMH Watch Week in New York, the CEOs of several of the conglomerate's watch and jewelry brands said they're increasingly optimistic about 2025. While China remains slow, they said a rebound in spending by Americans \u2014 both in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 is driving strong demand for both watches and jewelry. \"I have to say that I've been positively surprised by the start of the year,\" said Jean-Christophe Babin, CEO of Bulgari, which is owned by LVMH.\n\nGet Inside Wealth directly to your inbox The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today.\n\nAnthony Ledru, the CEO of Tiffany & Co., which LVMH acquired in 2021, said he's also seeing renewed consumer confidence among the American wealthy after the U.S. presidential election. \"I think it brings clarity and probably a greater consumer confidence,\" Ledru said. \"We need that feel-good factor to succeed in the luxury world.\" Of course, there are risks to the bright outlook. U.S. tariffs are the big unknown for high-end watches, which are mostly made in Switzerland, as well as for French luxury goods. The Trump administration has threatened across-the-board tariffs in Europe. Yet for now, watch and jewelry makers are launching a barrage of new products in hopes of a strong 2025. Louis Vuitton's watch division launched its new \"Tambour Taiko Spin Time\" collection, which features \"jumping cubes\" for numbers that were inspired by old airport flap displays. The company's G\u00e9rald Genta line launched the new \"Gentissima Oursin Fire Opal,\" made from 137 orange and red opal gems, mined from Mexican volcanoes.\n\nLouis Vuitton \"Tambour Taiko Spin Time\" in Hawk's Eye. CNBC\n\nG\u00e9rald Genta Gentissima Oursin Fire Opal. CNBC\n\nJean Arnault, director of Louis Vuitton watches, who also oversees the Genta and Daniel Roth brands, said he has a decades-long plan to make Louis Vuitton one of the most respected watchmakers among top collectors \u2014 known for high complications and craftsmanship, and commanding high prices. \"Before Louis Vuitton rhymes with watchmaking in the wider world, we'll probably wait a whole generation until that happens,\" he said. \"What's important to me is making sure that they know when Louis Vuitton makes watches, they know they are very high quality, that they have no doubt. We are focusing on high complications and pieces with high price points.\" TAG Heuer, which just announced a partnership with Formula 1 to replace Rolex as the official timekeeper, said it's already seen a boost in sales since the announcement in October. At LVMH Watch Week, the company launched a new Formula 1 collection, with bright dials and chronograph movements. Antoine Pin, CEO of TAG Heuer, said the sales benefits from the F1 announcement were literally \"overnight.\" \"My surprise was that any announcement we're making with F1 is immediately leading to significant reactions,\" he said. \"And clearly, the beauty of social media is that you can quickly measure the impact. And we've seen massive expansion of reaction and very positive reactions. So it was a very good decision.\"\n\nTAG Heuer F1 model. CNBC\n\nOn the jewelry side, Tiffany saw a 9% increase in same-store sales in the fourth quarter, LVMH said during its earnings call. Tiffany's flagship \"Landmark\" store, on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, saw strong sales over the holiday season with long lines from visitors. The newly renovated store, which LVMH spent hundreds of millions to reimagine, now features a popular Blue Box Cafe by Daniel Boulud and a new VIP suite on the 10th floor, offering views of Central Park, fine art, rare Tiffany lamps and high-jewelry pieces priced for six or seven figures. Tiffany CEO Ledru said the company's average price point has doubled since LVMH acquired the jewelry maker. By upgrading the company's retail stores, focusing on high-end jewelry and launching its new \"icons\" collections, based on historical Tiffany designs, the brand has been able to quickly move up-market. Its hottest seller is the \"hardware\" collection, especially its gold chain-link necklace that sells for over $19,000, Ledru said. \"It's a pretty drastic transformation,\" he said. \"We went after a client that spends more, spends more time in the store and engages at a higher price point. It's demanding. It's a very particular ecosystem. The more you go up, the more you need to have amazing stores, amazing staff, amazing products, amazing events and communication that aligns with all of that.\" Bulgari, whose largest market has traditionally been China, is hoping to see a sales lift during the year of the snake in the Chinese zodiac, which officially began with the Chinese Lunar New Year on Wednesday. Bulgari CEO Babin said that while the Chinese economy is \"tough\" right now, there are signs that government stimulus could start rebuilding consumer confidence this year. He said Bulgari's popular \"Serpenti Viper\" collections, modeled after viper snakes, are top-sellers. \"Serpenti is the icon of Bulgari, and this is the year of the snake, so this should be the year of Bulgari,\" he said. The rising wealth held by women around the world, from higher earnings, entrepreneurship and inheritances, is also reshaping the company's client base. While a large share of sales used to be to men buying jewelry as gifts, now women are buying for themselves. \"Today you have a real gender equality in most countries,\" Babin said. \"Women's purchasing power is very similar to men's purchasing power, which is a revolution in luxury.\"\n\nTiffany \"Bird on a flying Tourbillon CNBC",

            "content": "The latest Lyst Index for Q4 continues to solidify its role as a barometer of brand desirability. With Miu Miu, Saint Laurent and Prada rounding out the top three, the data-driven ranking, which aggregates online shopping behavior, social media engagement, and search volume, has become a credible measure of a brand\u2019s heat. Yet, in a surprising twist, only one LVMH maison\u2014Loewe\u2014secured a place among the top 20, raising questions about the conglomerate\u2019s standing in an era of shifting consumer preferences.\n\nThe validity of the Lyst Index\n\nWhile traditional measures of brand strength\u2014such as financial performance and runway influence\u2014remain relevant, the Lyst Index provides an insightful snapshot of real-time consumer sentiment. With digital engagement now a primary driver of luxury sales, the ability to capture audience attention online is nearly as crucial as artistic credibility or retail expansion. In this regard, Lyst offers a reflection of a brand\u2019s cultural capital, which is increasingly shaped by influencers, celebrity endorsements, and social media traction. For brands looking to translate cultural relevance into commercial success, ignoring the Lyst rankings would be short-sighted.\n\nLoewe: A case study in relevance\n\nThat Loewe is the sole LVMH representative in the Q4 ranking is testament to the power of creative direction and digital momentum. Under Jonathan Anderson, the Spanish house has evolved from a quiet, leather-centric heritage brand to a powerhouse of artistic experimentation and viral appeal. From its surrealist runway presentations to its playful campaign imagery, Loewe has deftly balanced high-fashion craftsmanship with digital-age storytelling. Its presence on the Lyst Index signals the success of this strategy, demonstrating how a maison can leverage cultural credibility to drive desirability.\n\nLVMH\u2019s star Maison faces a crossroads\n\nBy contrast, Dior\u2014LVMH\u2019s crown jewel\u2014finds itself at a pivotal moment. With Kim Jones set to exit his role as men\u2019s artistic director, and rumors swirling around Maria Grazia Chiuri\u2019s tenure at the women\u2019s division, the maison appears to be in flux. The brand\u2019s latest haute couture show, while undeniably elegant, failed to generate the kind of excitement that fuels online buzz.\n\nThe industry\u2019s gaze is now fixed on LVMH\u2019s next moves. Will Dior\u2019s eventual leadership reshuffle reinvigorate the brand\u2019s creative direction? Or will the maison\u2019s reliance on timeless elegance over spectacle cost it digital engagement? In a luxury landscape increasingly dictated by the online sphere, the ability to captivate audiences beyond the physical runway is no longer optional.\n\nThe future of LVMH\u2019s digital dominance\n\nLVMH may dominate the global luxury market, but the Lyst Index serves as a reminder that brand desirability is ever-evolving. Loewe\u2019s rise underscores the power of narrative-driven fashion, while the lukewarm reception of large-scale fashion week events highlights the dangers of creative stagnation. As LVMH navigates leadership transitions and shifting consumer expectations, its ability to balance heritage with digital-age engagement will be crucial in shaping its long-term standing\u2014both on the Lyst Index and in the broader cultural landscape. Notably, despite its high visibility, Louis Vuitton and its men's artistic director, Pharrell Williams, were also absent from the top 20.\n\nFor now, as luxury brands vie for attention in an increasingly saturated digital ecosystem, one thing remains clear: heat, in fashion, is as much about perception as it is about product. And in the battle for relevance, LVMH still has work to do.",

Arnault revealed that he had discussed Meta\u2019s decision to let go of low-performing employees with Mark Zuckerberg last week, describing the move as a way to \u201cpromote outwards\u201d those workers. read more\n\nLVMH CEO Bernard Arnault described Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to lay off underperforming Meta employees as an opportunity for them to be \u201cpromoted outwards, so to speak.\u201d\n\nArnault, who leads the luxury goods conglomerate behind brands like Louis Vuitton, Fendi, and Sephora drew a parallel between Zuckerberg\u2019s recent layoffs at Meta and similar actions taken at Tiffany\u2019s, suggesting that being laid off could be seen as a form of promotion.\n\nDuring a Tuesday earnings call, Arnault mentioned that he had discussed the layoffs with Zuckerberg, noting that the affected workers were being \u201cpromoted outwards, so to speak.\u201d In mid-January, Meta announced an internal memo revealing it would reduce its workforce by 5% due to performance issues, equating to about 3,600 jobs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the cuts, Meta plans to hire new employees to fill the vacancies, as the company employed approximately 72,000 people as of September 2024.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in an internal message, according to Bloomberg. \u201cWe typically manage out people who aren\u2019t meeting expectations over a year, but now we\u2019re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.\u201d\n\nDuring LVMH\u2019s Tuesday earnings call, Bernard Arnault shared that a similar approach was taken with employees at Tiffany\u2019s, the iconic jewelry brand acquired by LVMH in 2021. Arnault described Tiffany\u2019s as a \u201csleeping beauty,\u201d which had been awakened only through LVMH\u2019s acquisition, and stated that the company \u201cdidn\u2019t have a choice\u201d but to make staff reductions. However, LVMH did not disclose how many employees were laid off at Tiffany\u2019s and did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nArnault explained that some employees were unable to adapt to the new demands at Tiffany\u2019s, noting, \u201cWhen you\u2019re used to sleeping for 10 years, and you\u2019re all of a sudden asked to become fierce, and when you\u2019re expected to achieve high objectives, some people can\u2019t. Unfortunately, we were not able to keep everyone.\u201d\n\nLVMH\u2019s decision reflects a broader trend in corporate jargon surrounding layoffs. For example, Amazon managers have referred to layoffs as \u201cunregretted attrition,\u201d and other companies have labeled job cuts as \u201crightsizing.\u201d While such measures may offer short-term benefits like cost reduction and increased efficiency, the Academy to Innovate HR warns of several drawbacks, including decreased employee morale, damage to the company\u2019s reputation, and potential legal risks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearch from Harvard Business Review suggests that job cuts rarely help senior leaders meet long-term goals, and a study from the University of Texas at Arlington found that layoffs often negatively affect stock prices. Economic historian Stephen Mihm, writing in Bloomberg, also argued that an increase in layoffs signals a revival of outdated corporate strategies, which, if continued, could severely harm these companies.",

However, the company reported a relatively underwhelming set of results yesterday evening,\" said Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot. LVMH on Tuesday attributed its revenue growth to solid demand within its selective retailing division \u2014 which includes retailer Sephora \u2014 and perfume and cosmetics. Growth was also broadly driven by consumers in the U.S., Europe and Japan, while the wider Asia Pacific region \u2014 and notably China \u2014 lagged. \"Sentiment among wealthier shoppers has recovered in Europe the U.S. and Japan but in China, which has been the powerhouse for the luxury sector it's still been weaker. Nevertheless, this is signs of steady progress, with the luxury ship chugging forward,\" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\nwatch now",

In record time, the company managed to pivot the event to New York; its commitment to carrying on a testament to the importance of the US market for LVMH\u2019s watch brands.\n\nIn the end, the sixth edition of the luxury conglomerate\u2019s watch event was held on the same dates between the Tiffany, Bvlgari and Louis Vuitton flagships, all nestled at or near the corner of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue.\n\n\u201cAll of our thoughts go with the people of LA that went through \u2014 and are still going through \u2014 a very difficult time. We didn\u2019t want to take a risk of doing the event there and also out of respect to the people of LA,\u201d Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH Watches, and third son of LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, tells guests during a dinner at Casa Cruz, a restaurant situated in a townhouse on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. \u201cWe decided very quickly on New York. We have probably the best monobrand stores in the world, [including] the Tiffany Landmark [the flagship on Fifth Avenue, which reopened in 2023] that\u2019s number one in terms of sales for the group. We are recreating our watch fair with these magnificent flagships.\u201d A second part of the event will be held between 30 and 31 January at LVMH\u2019s Cheval Blanc Paris hotel.\n\nThe New York event coincided with the week of President Trump\u2019s inauguration, which was attended by Bernard, his wife H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mercier Arnault and two of his children: Delphine and Alexandre Arnault (the family sat behind the row of former US presidents).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the inauguration of a new president here in the US, and the US is a very important market for us at LVMH and for us in watches,\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric. \u201cIt has been very dynamic last year and we all have high hopes and optimism for the economy and the watch business here, so we wanted to be present in the US for this Watch Week.\u201d (Previous editions have taken place in Dubai, Singapore and Miami.)",

Floral draping and organza feathers embellish the women in spectacular finery.\n\n\n\nA modern and practical version of crinoline creates new volumes. The visible structures of cages reveal legs, and the cascades of embroidered cages undulate with every movement.

            "content": "In January 2020, LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury goods company, held its first dedicated watch week in Dubai. The event, which featured four of the group\u2019s brands\u2014Bulgari, Hublot, TAG Heuer, and Zenith\u2014served as a statement-making counterpoint to Baselworld, the longstanding yet troubled Swiss trade fair where watchmakers had traditionally unveiled their newest timepieces. So successful was the event that in subsequent years, LVMH brought it to Singapore and Miami.\n\nThis year, the group had planned to stage its 2025 watch week in my hometown of Los Angeles, at a hillside villa, by all accounts spectacular. Tragically, two weeks before the festivities were due to get under way, L.A. was devastated by wildfires, forcing LVMH\u2014and its nine timepiece brands, including watch week stalwarts Bulgari, Daniel Roth, G\u00e9rald Genta, Hublot, TAG Heuer and Zenith, as well as newcomers Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co. and L\u2019Ep\u00e9e 1839\u2014to make a drastic pivot.\n\nWhich explains why last Monday, Jan. 20\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, as well as Inauguration Day\u2014I found myself on a flight to frigid New York City. The new epicenter of the two-day affair (not quite a week, but who\u2019s counting?) was Tiffany & Co.\u2019s Landmark Building at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street.\n\nWhen I arrived for my first set of appointments on the morning of Tuesday, Jan. 21, I rode the elevator to the 8th floor terrace and exhibition space, where it was impossible not to admire the view: To the north, the eye-popping fa\u00e7ade of the under-renovation Louis Vuitton flagship, designed to look like a stack of enormous luggage trunks, and to the east, on the snow-covered terrace, a 13-foot-tall animatronic light sculpture featuring Tiffany\u2019s Jean Schlumberger-designed avian icon, Bird on a Rock, illuminated with over 60,000 LED lights.\n\nWATCH\n\nHublot Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic Green Saxem Hublot\n\nFor the next several hours, I rotated between product presentations and CEO interviews, beginning with a tour of the Tiffany archives on the 10th floor, where I marveled at the brand\u2019s most recent acquisition: a historic pocket watch purchased by three women as a gesture of thanks to the captain of the passenger ship R.M.S. Carpathia, who saved them along with 700 others when their luxury liner, the Titanic, sank in April 1912 after striking an iceberg.\n\nLater that night, journalists and brand executives mingled at Casa Cruz, a private members\u2019 club on East 61st Street. After cocktails and canapes, we took our assigned seats for dinner, and I found myself seated at a long table in the back of the room, across from Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, LVMH Watches\u2019 29-year-old chief executive.\n\nLouis Vuitton\u2019s new Tambour Convergence watches Louis Vuitton\n\nOver dinner, I learned that Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\u2019s father, LVMH founder and CEO Bernard Arnault, the wealthiest person in France and the fifth wealthiest in the world, had attended the Trump inauguration the day before along with his son, Alexandre, and his daughter Delphine. (Indeed, photos of them standing behind Bill and Hillary Clinton were the talk of the town in the days that followed.)\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and I chatted a bit about L.A. and TAG Heuer\u2019s exciting new Formula 1 sponsorship (wrested away from Rolex, no less), not to mention the highlights of the week\u2019s novelties. But for real insights into the state of the business and the strategies the group\u2019s brands are using to navigate a tougher economic climate in 2025, I went straight to the CEOs.\n\nTAG Heuer Formula 1\n\nMany of their remarks were vague and filled with typical management platitudes, but\n\nbelow are some of the snippets of conversation that caught my attention over two days\n\nof schmoozing with watch executives employed by one of the most powerful groups in\n\nthe industry.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, chief executive, LVMH Watches, speaking on Jan. 21 in a welcome address to journalists and brand executives at Casa Cruz:\n\n\u201cSo, as you all know, we were supposed to be in L.A. initially. And, of course, all of our thoughts go with the people of L.A. that went through and are still going through a very difficult time. We felt we didn\u2019t want to take a risk of still doing the events there and also of respect to the people in L.A. It was an event that we organized for eight months. We had to reorganize a little bit in two weeks.\n\n\u201cWe decided very quickly on New York, and we thought, \u2018Okay, we have probably the best monobrand stores in the world with the Landmark and Tiffany was also the No. 1 in terms of sales for the group. The new Louis Vuitton store that you all discover and, of course, the flagship of Bulgari. And the two of them are almost on the same block. And so we\u2019re creating our own watch fair with a magnificent flagship.\u201d\n\nAntoine Pin, chief executive of TAG Heuer, during a press roundtable on Jan. 21:\n\nTAG Heuer\n\n\u201cI would rather call [the current period] normalization or back to reality than a major crisis. But it\u2019s true that for some brands, it\u2019s probably a wake-up call. And it\u2019s particularly painful when our industry being what it is\u2014that is to say, a very long-term industry\u2014is placing orders for next year. (Right now, we\u2019re buying components for 2026.) If there\u2019s a drop, you\u2019re stuck with pieces that you don\u2019t necessarily need. And so the notion of cash has always been a real question for this industry. For years, we were dealing with low interest rates. Money was not expensive. It\u2019s not the case anymore.\u201d\n\nOn the appeal of Formula 1:\n\n\u201cWhen Netflix brought out \u2018Formula 1: Drive to Survive,\u2019 you feel the tensions. You feel the rivalries. You feel the fear. You feel the eagerness. You feel the jealousy. You feel something that looks very, very mechanical and somewhat harsh from a pure technical perspective, and it ends up being a men\u2019s battle. And it\u2019s not just the races. It\u2019s all of the things that are happening between the races that actually turn the championship into a long, long story\u2026. This emotional connection, that\u2019s what we can bring. We can continue to play the role of Netflix in a different perspective.\u201d\n\nOn bringing clients to Formula 1:\n\n\u201cYou can imagine that with these kinds of things, there are lots of people, lots of stakeholders that are queuing. But you know the beauty is we\u2019ve got 10 years to take everybody. That\u2019s true. Because we don\u2019t have so many seats. So people will have to wait in the queue probably.\u201d\n\nJulien Tornare,Hublot\u2019s new chief executive, during a roundtable press meeting on Jan. 22:\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the brand is to inspire people and empower them to acquire a watch that would reinforce their singularity, their personality. Hublot is not a watch that you buy, you put on your wrist, you get on the plane, and you see half the plane wearing the same one. If you want that, there are other brands. You wear any Hublot and it\u2019s also to show that you want to be special. You want to be unique. You want to be different, and you are proudly different.\n\nHublot\n\n\u201cNow, the idea is, how do we go to the next step? How do we continue this? Keeping in mind that Hublot cannot be normal. Hublot has to be different, has to be disruptive to exist and to reinforce itself because that\u2019s really the DNA of the brand, since Mr. Crocco.\u201d (Tornare was referring to brand founder Carlo Crocco, who, in 1980, made watchmaking history by producing the first luxury gold watch on a natural rubber strap.)\n\nBenoit de Clerck, chief executive of Zenith, during a one-on-one meeting with Robb Report on Jan. 22:\n\nZenith\n\n\u201cThere are two types of collectors: One type is like art lovers. They go deep into their purchase and they buy a nice piece of art. And they spend millions on this. And then you have the other type of collector that is in the business to do business. That means that they\u2019re more transactional. But they have time and they have money. I\u2019m not saying one is better than the other, but in my view, there are two types. And when I talk to collectors, the first time I see them, I always try to understand, is he a flipper, an investor, or is he a watch lover? And then the discussion is very different.\u201d\n\nMatthieu Hegi, artistic director of La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton, during a Jan. 22 meeting at Louis Vuitton\u2019s temporary flagship on East 57th Street where he showed off the brand\u2019s newest Tambour wristwatches:\n\nWe are focusing on being \u201cstate of the art in terms of finishing. We are really going up and up. Our aim now is to have something that really is more and more elegant.\u201d\n\nMichel Navas, co-founder and master watchmaker of La Fabrique Du Temps Louis Vuitton, during a Jan. 22 preview of new Daniel Roth timepieces:\n\nDaniel Roth Extra Plat Souscription Daniel Roth\n\n\u201cI love Daniel Roth because the mindset is always as an artist, as a watchmaker, and you can very quickly discover a Daniel Roth because of the shape. It\u2019s a double ellipse case, and it\u2019s beautiful.\n\n\u201cWe want [the finishing] to be discreet and, of course, with the utmost respect for high watchmaking, but subtle, very, very delicate. That\u2019s what we want. And if you see the shape of the bridges\u2014the aesthetics mean a lot for us. In terms of the movement, we want it to be about aesthetics.\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nLVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton posted fiscal 2024 revenue of 84.7 billion euros, or about $88.3 billion, representing a 2% year-over-year decline from 2023, according to a Tuesday release. Fourth quarter revenue was flat year over year at 23.9 billion euros.\n\nProfit from recurring operations fell 14% for the year to 19.6 billion euros, with almost every division experiencing losses except selective retailing, which remained flat. Profits in the wines and spirits division dropped 36%, while perfume and cosmetics profits fell 6%.\n\nThe company\u2019s largest division, fashion and leather goods, posted a revenue decrease of 3% to 41 billion euros for the year and a 10% profit loss. The watches and jewelry division also saw a 3% revenue drop, and posted a 28% profit loss for the period.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe luxury sector is projected to see continued sluggishness through at least 2027, but some companies are weathering recent consumer spending shifts better than others.\n\nEarlier this month, Richemont reported record Q3 sales, led by its jewelry division, while Brunello Cucinelli posted year-over-year growth of more than 12% for fiscal 2024. Meanwhile, Burberry is at the beginning of a company-wide transformation designed to restart growth, and Zegna is holding steady as its DTC sales surge.\n\nFor LVMH, Tuesday\u2019s earnings reflected \u201ca challenging economic and geopolitical environment,\u201d per the release. The company, which owns fashion houses including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Loewe, Loro Piana, Celine and Givenchy, said the year-over-year comparison basis proved especially difficult after several years of growth following the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn 2024, amid an uncertain environment, LVMH showed strong resilience,\u201d Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, said in the release. \u201cThis capacity to weather the storm in highly turbulent times \u2014 already illustrated on many occasions throughout our Group\u2019s history \u2014 is yet another testament to the strength and relevance of our strategy.\u201d\n\nBy region, revenue was largely flat in 2024, with the exception of Japan, which was up about 18% year over year. Asia, excluding Japan, fell 12.5%.\n\nDeparting LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony, who will become president and CEO of the wines and spirits division effective Feb. 1, said in a Tuesday conference call with analysts that the company\u2019s approach to pricing was part of the reason for the profit decline in 2024.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t, or almost haven't, increased prices last year, so we couldn\u2019t offset in gross margin the increase in the price of labor, the cost of labor or input,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the same call, Arnault said he wanted to be thoughtful about how increased prices might affect customers moving forward.\n\n\u201cCustomers are increasingly aware of the value of the product, beyond the price, if you will,\u201d he said, adding that when prices are raised there needs to be a justification, such as better quality or new materials.\n\n\u201c...[A] number of houses have, unfortunately \u2014again, not all \u2014 but some have increased their prices in a somewhat extravagant manner without really giving any justification or having any justification to provide,\u201d Arnault said. \u201cI mean, pushing prices up 15% just doesn\u2019t make sense if there\u2019s no change in the product. And if that happens, then the clients just wonder what\u2019s happening and why they're being taken for a ride. You have to be realistic.\u201d\n\nIn the earnings release, Arnault said that LVMH would be \u201chighly vigilant with regard to cost management\u201d and focused on product desirability in 2025.\n\n\u201cGuided by our mission \u2014 \u2018Passionate about creativity\u2019 \u2014 and our core values, the Group will rely on the agility and talent of its teams to set the stage for future success and further extend its leadership in the luxury market,\u201d Arnault said.",

SEBASTIAN BOETTCHER / Courtesy Stella McCartney\n\nThe luxury giant purchased the stake in Stella McCartney\u2019s business in 2019, and at the same time brought her on board as a consultant in all things green. McCartney\u2019s previous investor was Kering, which had a 50 percent stake in her company.\n\nArnault said in 2019 that he was \u201cextremely happy\u201d about the partnership, and a decisive factor in the deal was McCartney\u2019s early decision \u201cto put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, and built her house around these constraints. It emphasizes LVMH Group\u2019s commitment to sustainability.\u201d\n\nThe luxury titan called the minority investment \u201cthe beginning of a beautiful story together. We are convinced of the great long-term potential of her house.\u201d\n\nFor her part, McCartney got what she wanted: She retained a majority stake in her company, while under former partner Kering she had a 50-50 deal. She also had a new business partner who was set to be more supportive on the eco-front.\n\nAt the time, sources said it was McCartney\u2019s friendship with Arnault\u2019s eldest son, Antoine Arnault, then chief executive officer of Berluti and chairman of Loro Piana, that helped to seal the deal. LVMH\u2019s own green ambitions were also a clincher.\n\nStella McCartney\u2019s selfie of the LVMH Prize jury with LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault in 2022. Stella McCartney/Courtesy of LVMH\n\n\u201cThe chance to realize and accelerate the full potential of the brand alongside Mr. Arnault and as part of the LVMH family, while still holding the majority ownership in the business, was an opportunity that hugely excited me,\u201d McCartney said in 2019.\n\nWhile Stella McCartney\u2019s full revenue was never disclosed and always consolidated onto the Kering balance sheet, it is thought to be about 300 million euros. The company\u2019s valuation when it split from Kering was estimated to be about 600 million euros, according to sources.\n\nWith LVMH as a partner, McCartney quickly got to work, shifting her fabric and supply chain research into high gear, and working closely with fellow LVMH brands.\n\nIn 2023, McCartney worked with Veuve Clicquot on a partnership that turned manually collected grape stems from the Champagne harvest into luxury accessories.\n\nMcCartney sent some of those accessories down the runway during her spring 2024 show at Paris Fashion Week. The open-air runway show was set up like a street market, and featured three Frayme bags and a bottle holder made from grape leather.\n\nA model at Stella McCartney\u2019s spring 2024 show carrying a bag made from upcycled grape waste. Courtesy\n\nShe also created two Elyse sandal styles that featured a platform wedge made from recycled cork waste collected from the Veuve Clicquot cellars in Reims, France.\n\nAccording to LVMH, the grape material was created in less than 18 months and helped to reduce two great sources of greenhouse gas emissions: leather and winemaking.\n\nThe grape stems were sourced with full traceability from the environmentally-certified Grand Cru vineyard of Bouzy in Champagne, which Madame Clicquot purchased 200 years ago.\n\nJean-Marc Gallot, CEO of Veuve Clicquot, said the grape leather was the result of a \u201cstrong collective effort and our expertise in regenerative agriculture. It fills me with joy, that beyond crafting one of the best Champagnes, our grapes can now also contribute to drive a brighter future in fashion.\u201d\n\nAsked how the collaboration came about, McCartney said she set a challenge for LVMH.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been looking at cross-industry collaboration within the group, and one day I said to Mr. Arnault, \u2018You know I\u2019m putting bags down my runway made from grape skin waste from the Italian wine industry. Give me one of your brands and let me use that waste,\u2019\u201d McCartney said.\n\nStella McCartney\u2019s new, mushroom leather Frayme Mylo bag, which will land in stores on July 1.

The handbag, which McCartney made in collaboration with the California-based Bolt Threads, retailed at 1,995 pounds.\n\nMcCartney said it was the first time that a \u201cmushroom handbag\u201d was available for sale. She added that it marked a milestone in her longstanding relationship with Bolt, and in overall vegan material innovation.\n\nThat same year McCartney was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, or CBE, in Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Birthday honors list. She received an OBE, or Order of the British Empire award, from the queen in 2013.\n\nThe designer also worked with King Charles III on environmental projects, and in 2021 represented the fashion industry at the G7 summit in Cornwall, England.\n\nWhile under the LVMH umbrella, the designer also launched Stella McCartney Beauty, a skin care line, in 2022. The ambitious project aimed to tick as many eco-boxes as possible using the fewest number of products, and ingredients.\n\nWhile the partnership may have been fruitful, the commercial end wasn\u2019t always easy.\n\nLike so many others, McCartney\u2019s business ran into trouble in 2020 during the pandemic, with international travel and tourism grinding to a halt, brick-and-mortar stores shutting and expenses piling up.\n\nCamila Alves McConaughey, Stella McCartney and Jessica Alba in 2023. Dave Benett/Getty Images\n\nDuring lockdown in 2020, the business began retrenching and restructuring. It laid off staff, asked others to reduce their salaries for an extended period, and cut back on certain activities with an eye on reducing the overall cost base. McCartney did not pay herself a salary that year.\n\nIn fiscal 2021 Stella McCartney\u2019s business reported losses of 32.7 million pounds on turnover of 32.5 million pounds, according to Companies House in the U.K. The figure only refers to the brand\u2019s sales in the U.K.\n\nTurnover in the 12 months to Dec. 31, 2021, rose 14 percent, while losses after-tax increased by 4.3 percent compared with the previous year. According to the filing, no dividends were paid.\n\nThe following year saw considerable improvement, with the company\u2019s loss before tax narrowing to 10 million pounds. Turnover in 2022 rose 23 percent to 40 million pounds. Operating loss shrank to 8.7 million pounds in the period, from 30 million pounds in 2021.\n\nThe Stella McCartney sale is not unusual. LVMH is constantly evaluating its investments, and last September sold Off-White LLC, the company that owns the Off-White brand, to the New York-based Bluestar Alliance LLC.\n\nLVMH originally bought a majority stake in Off-White in 2021, and later raised it to 60 percent before selling the company.\n\nThat deal came within days of LVMH teaming with the Italian entrepreneur Remo Ruffini to increase his stake in Moncler.\n\nOver the next 18 months, the plan is for Ruffini\u2019s investment vehicle, Double R, to buy more shares in Moncler SpA, boosting its stake to a maximum of 18.5 percent, consolidating Ruffini\u2019s hold as the largest single shareholder.\n\nLVMH will be providing the funding for those purchases and, in the process, will increase its investment in Double R up to a maximum of roughly 22 percent.\n\nRuffini, whose title is chairman and CEO of Moncler Group, told WWD last month that he\u2019s grateful to Arnault for investing in Double R after two long-term shareholders exited earlier this year.",

A play of volumes is omnipresent, accompanied by captivating draping. Modern-day extravagant dressers sport flowing coats with belted waists, their eyes concealed by delicate masks. At the same time lavish and pared back, the silhouettes concentrate the noblest fabrics, with a predominance of silks and satins.\n\n\n\nLeather goods provide a counterpoint to this structured elegance. A Dior Roller in shearling contrasts with Dior Normandie totes in exceptional leathers. Classic dress shoes and Dior Palmar\u00e8s leather boots are elevated by a knotted satin toe cap, a couture motif found throughout the collection. Sneakers fuse exuberance and artisanal excellence, with hand embroidery that revisits the pattern of a 1961 shoe.\n\n\n\nPinstripes and herringbone patterns bring a touch of brilliance, while glass beading as delicate as raindrops highlights shoulder lines. Closing the show, a soft pink satin couture robe is adorned with floral embroidery that references the Pondich\u00e9ry look of Monsieur Dior\u2019s Spring-Summer 1948 haute-couture collection. The motifs are borrowed for jewelry, notably a sterling silver chatelaine worn on the best. The 18th-century inspired ornamental chain features a full array of couturier\u2019s tools, including a thimble and scissors.\n\n",

            "content": "The announcement, very brief, came last night: Stella McCartney acquires the stake that LVMH held in her eponymous brand, making it fully independent once again. The news is unusual. Certainly, there have been cases where brand founders, after accumulating enough capital, bought out the stakes of other investors to regain full independence. But the only truly striking case of a founder essentially paying to leave an industrial group and make their brand independent again is that of Azzedine Alaia, when he exited the Prada Group more than a decade ago, in 2007. Like Alaia, who maintained ties with the group he left for the production of shoes and bags, McCartney is not expected to sever ties with LVMH but to remain within the group in the somewhat vague role of \u201cglobal ambassador for sustainability\u201d. But what drove McCartney, especially during a period of global luxury market crisis, to want to leave the logistical and managerial platform of the world\u2019s most important luxury group and face the stormy waters of the market alone? Who would want to step down from the winner's podium? On her social media, Vanessa Friedman wondered whether this move might be \u00aba sign of the Trump era\u00bb and it\u2019s hard not to see a connection between the reversal the new U.S. government is making regarding sustainability obligations for companies, Arnault's presence at Trump\u2019s inauguration, and the strict focus Stella McCartney has placed on sustainability in her brand.\n\nOur hypothesis is that, to avoid ideological compromise, both McCartney and LVMH decided to part ways: this way, McCartney can maintain her policies and preserve her freedom of expression, while Arnault has eliminated a potential dissenting voice from within his ranks. In fact, McCartney spoke at the COP28 of the United Nations in December 2023, advocating for changes to tariffs on leather products or non-sustainable materials. If she were to make such comments today, they might have a different resonance with the U.S. government and potentially provoke some kind of retaliation, whether through a social media storm on X/Twitter or threats of new tariffs in America. Of course, what lies between the lines may run deeper than this. For example, it\u2019s impossible not to wonder why LVMH decided to part with an asset, assuming it was indeed generating profits. Here, the hypotheses are twofold. One might think McCartney wanted to dissociate herself from LVMH's aggressive business model and proceed at a more organic pace without interference from a high table. Alternatively, perhaps more imaginatively, the designer might have realized she couldn\u2019t keep up with the price escalation strategy and now wants to see if her products could find success in a more accessible market segment\u2014in which case, McCartney should be commended for her shrewdness.\n\nStella McCartney buying LVMH out of their stake in her brand and going indie again - but staying as group sustainability \u00ab ambassador. \u00bb Sign of the Trumpian times? \u2014 Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) January 27, 2025\n\nBut perhaps there\u2019s a reason the separation appeared consensual. We might also think that the effects of the luxury consumption crisis are pushing groups like LVMH to concentrate their resources on high-return brands such as Dior and Louis Vuitton, discarding the smaller fish\u2014when the sea is stormy, the first thing to do is throw ballast overboard. In any case, the news was delivered so briefly as to suggest that both parties are trying to wrap up the matter quickly and without too much exposure. Whether it\u2019s a sign of the luxury crisis or a sign of a new direction remains unclear. The only certainty is that, with 2025, we have officially entered a period where increasingly unexpected events may unfold: the more LVMH\u2019s business depends on the U.S. and thus its relationship with Trump, the more the progressive ideologies of fashion and its designers will find themselves at points of conflict and friction. But in a world dominated by PR relations, will fashion and its players know how to\u2014or be able to afford to\u2014speak out loudly?",

            "content": "To kick off 2025, Zenith has launched two watches that confirm its continued pursuit of modernity in watchmaking. Many people, if asked to summon to mind recent wins for the brand, would offer up successful re-editions of designs from its back catalogue, from the back-to-basics Chronomaster Original to last year\u2019s Defy Diver, which turned heads for its splashes of bright orange and faithful reimagining of a less well known vintage reference.\n\nBut, as part of LVMH Watch Week 2025, Zenith has revealed two watches that call on far more contemporary inspirations and trends.\n\nThe first is the Chronomaster Sport Rainbow, a watch that builds on recent hits across the industry - including within Zenith\u2019s own collections - for gem-set sports watches in general and rainbow-set designs in particular. Taking as its canvas the sturdy and popular Chronomaster Sport, Zenith has set the bezel in twelve distinct segments of baguette-cut sapphires, each separated by a clear diamond, and accompanied by twelve matching baguette-set hour markers on the black dial within. In total, its 62 gemstones comprise 5.36 carats.\n\nThe Zenith Chronomaster Sport Rainbow (Image credit: Zenith)\n\nThe 41mm watch is cased in white gold - a first for the Chronomaster Sport collection \u2013 and follows the introduction of a gem-set model in 18k rose gold last year. Under the skin it is unchanged, with the El Primero automatic 3600 calibre beating at 5Hz. The watch\u2019s high-frequency timing is signalled by the central seconds hand, which rotates once in ten seconds and enables timing down to 1/10th of a second.\n\nThe second new model from Zenith is the Defy Skyline Chronograph Skeleton, an integrated bracelet design that fills a gap in the brand\u2019s line-up. With time-only skeletonised models, openworked chronographs in the Defy 21 and Defy Extreme collections, the obvious next step was to open out the standard Skyline Chronograph. Zenith has done just that with two versions of the Skyline Chronograph Skeleton in blue and black.\n\nThe Zenith Defy Skyline Chronograph Skeleton (Image credit: Zenith)\n\nThe skeletonisation \u2013 whereby normally solid plates, bridges and wheels are hollowed out to their structural minimum, and the dial removed \u2013 follows an aesthetic already established in the Defy Skyline Automatic, with symmetrical, geometric shapes (some of which echo Zenith\u2019s vintage \u2018double Z\u2019 logo) and matte-finished textures. The stainless steel watches are identical save for their colour scheme, measuring 42mm across and with 100m water resistance. Each uses the same Calibre 3600 as the Chronomaster Sport, with the same 60-hour power reserve, 5Hz frequency and high-speed central seconds hand. Each watch comes with a swappable rubber strap, colour-matched to the skeletonised movement.\n\nzenith-watches.com\n\nWallpaper* Newsletter Receive our daily digest of inspiration, escapism and design stories from around the world direct to your inbox.

We played a bit with the Dark Green model, and found it to be almost dark grey, with hints of a green underbelly. Quite quaint.\n\nHublot also added a new Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic in Green Saxem. Saxem is a special material they introduced in 2023, see our hands on review here. The watch is now in an brilliant emerald green. As well as a Spirit of Big Bang Year of the Snake, with a bezel decorated to look like the scales of a snake.\n\nLens Position: 710\n\nRelease details MECA-10\n\nAlways at the forefront of creativity and innovation, Hublot stunned the world of watchmaking when it first unveiled the Big Bang MECA-10 in 2016, a playful watch with a movement construction like no other. Now, nearly a decade later, Hublot brings back the MECA-10 with an optimized calibre in a more compact 42mm case in King Gold, Titanium and Frosted Carbon.\n\nHublot has reinvented creativity in a modern interpretation of the mechanical watch movement. Void of a conventional dial, the MECA-10 makes visible and aestheticizes something that is normally hidden. Inspired by Meccano-type construction systems, the MECA-10 is a masterclass in micromechanical engineering and a creatively intriguing spin on how we perceive mechanics and the motion of time itself. Like a construction that\u2019s fashioned layer by layer, brick by brick, the Big Bang MECA-10 offers something to discover in every element from every angle, where the interconnection between them creates a dynamic choreography.\n\nThe original Big Bang MECA-10 broke all the rules upon its release 2016 with its unique form, consisting of a ring-shaped base plate onto which the bridges are attached. The result was one of visual intrigue and structural integrity. Now, Hublot revisits this unique take on the manual-winding skeleton movement with a refined, open and coherent display, while maintaining its distinctive construction that\u2019s elevated with refined finishing and decoration. For the engineers and watchmakers at Hublot, the challenge was to preserve all that makes the MECA-10 so original, while reducing its dimensions to fit the 42mm Big Bang case without compromising its performance.\n\nTrue to its name, the Big Bang MECA-10 features an impressive power reserve of 10 days. What truly make it stand out however is its power reserve indicator. Delivered by two mainspring barrels, the energy level of the movement can be read by means of a digital display that shows the power reserve as the number of days of autonomy remaining. These indications are driven by a \u201ccr\u00e9maill\u00e8re\u201d rack system rarely seen in mechanical watches, consisting of a linear gear engaging a circular gear, moving in a straight line.\n\nThe balance wheel, positioned on the dial side of the movement, is entirely visible. Beyond providing ceaseless animation to the display, it also highlights Hublot\u2019s unique and patented fine adjusted mechanism. The regulating organ features a lubricant-free and paramagnetic silicon escape wheel. For precise time-setting, the new Big Bang MECA-10 features a hacking seconds mechanism.\n\nRelease details Spirit of Big Bang Chronograph Ceramic\n\nUpon its launch in 2014, the Spirit of Big Bang took Hublot fans and watch-lovers by surprise, as it was the very first Hublot since the establishment of the brand decades earlier to feature a case that wasn\u2019t round. And yet, the Spirit of Big Bang is inherently and unmistakably a Hublot. The barrel shape remains a porthole, a window into the future of watchmaking far beyond conventions.\n\nFor the first time in the collection, the cases and bezels are crafted in coloured ceramics that were previously only available in the round Big Bang shape: Sand Beige, Dark Green and Sky Blue, each limited to 200 pieces. Colourful, hypoallergenic, light, scratch-resistant and gender-neutral in their appeal, these three new models are a testament to Hublot\u2019s unrivalled prowess when it comes to cutting-edge materials and developing ceramic for watches in unprecedented tones.\n\nVisible through the open dials, the Spirit of Big Bang Chronograph models are powered by the Hublot automatic skeleton chronograph calibre HUB4700, which is a modernized descendant of the historic and highly prized El Primero, considered the first Swiss high-frequency integrated chronograph calibre ever made. Visible from both the open dial and sapphire display back, the movement hosts several technical innovations and advancements compared to the original from 1969, including a low-friction silicon escape wheel.\n\nMatching each of the three coloured ceramic cases in this new trio of Spirit of Big Bang Chronograph watches, the dials feature hour markers, chronograph counters and hands in a matching tone. The rubber straps, made of black rubber with a coloured central inlay, are also perfectly coordinated with the coloured ceramic cases.",

            "content": "Richemont gave the luxury sector some unexpected good news earlier this month, reporting a surprisingly strong 10 percent increase in fourth-quarter sales, including robust business in the US and Europe and a less-dire outlook for China. On Friday, Burberry also reported better-than-anticipated results, including a big uptick in its US business.\n\nLVMH\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings, due out on Wednesday, will either confirm that luxury\u2019s rebound is underway, or expose Richemont and Burberry as the exceptions that prove the rule. Investors are betting on the former: LVMH\u2019s stock has risen 14 percent since Richemont put out its results, to a roughly six-month high.\n\nThere\u2019s solid grounds for optimism. The drivers behind Richemont and Burberry\u2019s results were similar \u2013 a less-severe downturn in China and decent demand elsewhere. A recovery at Burberry in particular bodes well, as the brand was among the hardest-hit when consumers worldwide began to pare back luxury spending last year.\n\nA more cautious view would consider that Burberry achieved its sales bump in part by slashing prices over the holidays. Even in reporting strong earnings, Burberry executives were careful not to call an end to the luxury sector\u2019s troubles. And key drivers behind Richemont\u2019s and Burberry\u2019s success \u2013 jewellery and outerwear, respectively \u2013 are not strengths of LVMH\u2019s biggest brands, which rely heavily on handbags to drive sales and profits. That category has been one of the worst-affected by the luxury downturn, and it will be tougher to once again convince consumers these items are worth the high price tag. It remains to be seen whether the backlash against higher prices (Dior in particular has been aggressive about hiking the cost of its bags), and a general lack of excitement around major brands, has given way to more positive consumer sentiment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEven if LVMH\u2019s results underwhelm, there are plenty of opportunities ahead to change the narrative. Lunar New Year begins on Jan. 29, and China has added an extra public holiday in an effort to boost consumer spending. In Paris, couture shows start on Jan. 27, with a packed schedule of awards shows and other red carpet events providing plenty of opportunities for brands to generate badly needed heat (though that may be harder than usual, with Hollywood celebrities potentially toning down their event looks due to the Los Angeles wildfires). Louis Vuitton has a busy schedule of activations for the 20th anniversary of its highly bankable Murakami collaboration. And of course, there is the next phase of designer reshuffles, which, if the rumour mill is to be believed, could include Jonathan Anderson moving into the top creative job at Dior.\n\nThe Week Ahead wants to hear from you!

Shown during Paris Fashion Week at the \u00c9cole Militaire, attendees entered a militant grey fortress and were immediately greeted by a sprawling, illuminated staircase. The front row was sprawling with the house\u2019s dearest friend \u2014 including Robert Pattinson, Kate Moss and Jay Chou.\n\nUsual Dior fashion show attendees are always eager to know what Jones has up his sleeves when it comes to the set. Since Jones started at Dior, his set has been a major part of his collection\u2019s storytelling. Jones told Hypebeast exclusively, \u201cThe set does reflect how we stripped everything back this season. I wanted to reflect that simplicity and rigour and yet give the sense of something monumental \u2014 it reinforces the ideas behind the collection. I always think of the set and the music at the same time as I think of the collection \u2014 they\u2019re indivisible to me.\u201d\n\nJones references Monsieur Dior\u2019s classic \u201cH Line\u201d from the namesake visionary\u2019s Fall 1954 haute couture collection. Every piece was designed with the illusion of a longer silhouette and the archival line saw double-breasted formals that were shaped in the letter of the \u201cH\u201d itself. Jones saw that elements of the Ligne H including the graphic and angular shape could be transferrable in the menswear world. This season, the notion of metamorphosis runs throughout the collection, from slippage of time periods to the changes of the garments of the archive from feminine to masculine.\n\nThe beginning and end of the show saw Jones intertwine ready-to-wear with more formal presentations to feature more couture-like silhouettes. Ethereal elegance becomes the main theme of the collection, reflecting a sense of simplicity that is clean, sophisticated and timeless. Continuing to take inspiration from the archive, the main embroidery in the collection comes from Monsieur Dior\u2019s Spring/Summer 1948 Haute Couture \u201cPondich\u00e9ry\u201d look and is recreated in the final pink robe look that closes the show. Fashion history runs through this collection, shifting from the extravagance from the 18th century to the more linear and utilitarian shapes of the 19th century. Applying these notions to Dior Men\u2019s FW25 collection, Kim Jones brings a contemporary lens to archival silhouettes, creating a timeless and forever collection.",

The event, split into two editions, saw nine Maisons, including Bulgari, Hublot, TAG Heuer, Zenith, Daniel Roth, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co. and L\u2019Ep\u00e9e 1839, present their latest timekeeping novelties.\n\nBuilding on the success of previous events in Dubai, Singapore and Miami, LVMH selected New York and Paris for the 2025 edition, connecting two continents vital to the LVMH Group\u2019s identity. The New York edition took place at Tiffany\u2019s iconic flagship, The Landmark on 5th Avenue, as well as nearby Louis Vuitton and Bvlgari stores over two days. From January 30-31, the event will continue with its Paris edition at the prestigious Cheval Blanc Paris hotel, in addition to other Maisons\u2019 stores.\n\nAs LVMH Watch Week 2025 wrapped up its New York edition, Hypebeast looks back to some of the most noteworthy watches from the event.\n\nDaniel Roth Extra Plat Souscription\n\n1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5\n\nFollowing the successful relaunch of Daniel Roth last year, the renowned name in independent watchmaking is continuing its revival with the Extra Plat Souscription. This new dress watch, developed and produced by La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton, epitomizes the brand\u2019s historical roots established in the 1990s.\n\nOriginally presented by Roth himself in 1990, the concept of an ultra-thin dress watch holds special significance, harkening back to the brand\u2019s founding era. The Extra Plat Souscription honors the brand\u2019s origins while introducing a new mechanical heart: the DR002 movement. Housed in an 18k yellow gold case starring a matching dial with clou de Paris hand-guilloch\u00e9, the case retains the original\u2019s iconic double ellipse silhouette and is complemented by a light beige-brown calfskin strap.\n\nLimited to just 20 examples, each watch exemplifies meticulous craftsmanship, with dials taking 10 hours of hand-guilloch\u00e9 work by a single artisan at La Fabrique du Temps. More details about the timepiece can be read here.\n\nLouis Vuitton Tambour Convergence in Rose Gold\n\n1 of 3 2 of 3 3 of 3\n\nLVMH Watch Week 2025 marks Louis Vuitton\u2019s first time participating as an exhibitor at the event. While the Tambour Taiko Spin Time Collection captured visitors\u2019 attention with tantalizing visual allure, there\u2019s something about the Tambour Convergence that leaves us awed. Contrary to the Taiko Spin Time, the Tambour Convergence shines in an unassuming and understated way with its guichet style design. Time is read via an aperture, which moves in a way that\u2019s reminiscent of vintage wandering hour wristwatches.\n\nClad in pink gold, the dial fa\u00e7ade is crafted with the intention of recording the passage of time through signs of wear. While it\u2019s common knowledge that gold is naturally far less scratch-resistant than steel, its somewhat ethereal quality makes every piece unique to its owner\u2019s journey. In addition to this, Louis Vuitton also unveiled a platinum variant that\u2019s snow-set with 795 diamonds. Check out the Maison\u2019s full lineup for LVMH Watch Week here.\n\nZenith Chronomaster Sport Rainbow\n\n1 of 4 2 of 4 3 of 4 4 of 4\n\nZenith has consistently exhibited an experimental spirit with its Defy series, but rarely has it ventured into the realm of gem-set novelties. Building on the success of its first-ever bejeweled Chronomaster Sport reference from last year, Zenith has now elevated the luxurious and colorful concept with the Chronomaster Sport Rainbow.\n\nThe gem-set bezel and baguette-cut sapphire indices of the Chronomaster Sport Rainbow create a vibrant spectrum of colors, perfectly complemented by a black lacquered dial plate that accentuates the brilliance of the gemstones. Meanwhile, the subdials, in shades of blue, dark gray and silver-gray, pay homage to the iconic tri-color palette of the Chronomaster.

Jean Schlumberger by Tiffany Twenty Four Stone Watch\n\n1 of 2 2 of 2\n\nTiffany & Co.\u2018s Twenty Four Stone Watch is a tribute to Jean Schlumberger\u2019s iconic Sixteen Stone collection, characterized by its rotating outer ring adorned with 24 round brilliant diamonds and 18k yellow gold cross-stitch motifs. Attired in a 39mm 18k white gold case, this exquisite timepiece is snow-set with 413 diamonds, with the central disc of the dial featuring an additional 220 diamonds, creating a dazzling and cohesive design.\n\nPowered by the Swiss-made LTM 2100 self-winding movement, the watch ensures reliable timekeeping with a 38-hour power reserve. Inspired by Schlumberger\u2019s Floral Arrows brooch, the caseback displays a sunburst pattern with diamond accents that add an extra touch of elegance to the piece. Completed with a Tiffany Blue alligator strap, this limited-production watch stands as a testament to the Maison\u2019s legendary expertise in horology and jewelry making.

            "content": "LVMH Watch Week 2025 delivered in full: wristwear that wouldn't feel out of place in the hip-hop bling era, statement pieces worthy of your For You Page, and watches dripping with nostalgia.\n\nFor the uninitiated, LVMH Watch Week (Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton) is an annual showcase of the latest horological flexes from the group\u2019s powerhouse brands \u2014 Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer, Daniel Roth, G\u00e9rald Genta, Bvlgari, Tiffany & Co., Hublot, and Zenith.\n\nMuch like its grip on fashion, LVMH has steadily carved its space in the watch industry, building a portfolio that competes with the best. And while I tend to lean toward independent watchmakers, there's something undeniably compelling \u2014 dare I say, exciting \u2014 about what LVMH is doing as watches and pop culture continue to collide.\n\nBeyond just unveiling new watches, this year\u2019s event hinted at the trends set to define 2025: nostalgia and bling. Expect these themes to dominate, with LVMH doubling down on both.\n\nThis year is shaping up to be one of the biggest for watches. Major brands are marking milestone anniversaries, while the next-gen players are dropping fresh heat.\n\nLVMH Watch Week is setting the tone for what we\u2019ll be talking about in 2025.\n\nNostalgia still reigns supreme\n\nCultural nostalgia is everywhere \u2014 archive fashion hauls, recycled pop culture throwbacks, and TikTok\u2019s 80s/90s/Y2K obsession. Naturally, watches have followed suit, and at LVMH Watch Week, nostalgia took center stage.\n\nNostalgia in watchmaking isn\u2019t new, but it\u2019s taken on a sharper edge. Vintage pieces and the romanticized eras they hail from still captivate seasoned collectors and new-gen buyers alike.\n\nIt\u2019s why reissues and callbacks aren\u2019t just popular \u2014 they\u2019re inevitable. And effective. Just look at how the recent Vacheron Constantin 222 reissue had collectors (me = collectors) foaming at the mouth.\n\nDaniel Roth Extra Plat Souscription with its new hand-wound caliber DR002 Daniel Roth\n\nThis year, the Daniel Roth Extra Plat Souscription was one of the best examples of how to do neo-vintage right. Once a grail confined to vintage retailers and collector wishlists, LVMH has brought it back while keeping its charm intact.\n\nCrafted in 18k gold, this faithful re-creation of the iconic 1990s-era dress watch offers modern precision without losing its original allure. Featuring an updated movement from La Fabrique du Temps, it\u2019s a masterclass in balancing the old with the new.\n\nTAG Heuer Carrera Chronosprint \u00d7 Porsche Rallye TAG Heuer\n\nTAG Heuer is also riding the nostalgia wave with the Carrera Chronosprint x Porsche Rallye.\n\nInspired by the 1965 Monte Carlo Rally, the watch honors Porsche\u2019s storied motorsport legacy with a speckled black dial and an innovative TH20-08 movement engineered to precisely measure 9.1 seconds \u2014 an homage to the Porsche 911 \"147\" Rally car.\n\nLouis Vuitton Tambour Convergence in rose gold Louis Vuitton 1 / 3\n\nAnd then there's the Louis Vuitton Tambour Convergence, arguably the unofficial face of LVMH Watch Week 2025. A nod to Art Deco-era montres \u00e0 guichet (aperture watches), it perfectly embodies LV's knack for blending nostalgia with modern luxury.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine Tyler, The Creator \u2014 a known fan of vintage Cartier and LV \u2014 eyeing this piece already. But I digress.\n\nAt this point, vintage watches aren\u2019t just popular \u2014 they dominate both social media and the market. LuxeConsult projects the pre-owned and vintage watch market to hit \u20ac79 billion by 2033.\n\nNostalgia in watches isn\u2019t going anywhere. These reissues and callbacks aren\u2019t just a nod to the past; they\u2019re an entry point for new collectors and a wink to long-time enthusiasts.\n\nOutside of LVMH, I expect to see many more reissues this year.\n\nWe\u2019re deep into the jewelry watch arc\n\nBling wasn\u2019t just present at LVMH Watch Week \u2014 it took over. Whether it\u2019s hip-hop's close proximity to watches, social media\u2019s influence, or the shrinking size of watches, the line between haute joaillerie and horology is disappearing.\n\n\"Both watchmakers and jewelers have since put their own spin on what they consider jewelry watches,\" writes style expert Gloria Fung. \"The definition has evolved as more men embrace jewelry watches, thanks in part to the looming influence of hip-hop culture.\"\n\nThis sentiment rings true in Watchfinder & Co.\u2019s 2024 study on Gen Z collectors, which found that 63% see watches more as jewelry than timepieces.\n\nGem setting of the Louis Vuitton Tambour Convergence in diamond-set platinum Louis Vuitton\n\nFrom Rihanna to Barry Keoghan and The Weeknd, blinged-out watches are no longer reserved for the red carpet \u2014 they\u2019re everyday essentials. Whether stacked with tennis bracelets or worn solo, iced-out watches are thriving.\n\nThe g\u00e9rald genta Gentissima Oursin Fire Opal with its 137 fire opals g\u00e9rald genta\n\nTake the G\u00e9rald Genta Gentissima Oursin Fire Opal. Though it taps into nostalgia for Genta\u2019s avant-garde designs, it also flexes serious high-jewelry energy. Featuring 137 Mexican fire opals set in a glass-blasted gold case, it\u2019s equal parts timepiece and statement jewelry.\n\nTiffany & Co. Carat 128 Facet yellow diamond watch Tiffany & Co 1 / 2\n\nThen there's Tiffany & Co., which stole the show with its haute joaillerie hybrid creations. The Bird on a Rock Full Pav\u00e9 Diamond Watch features 1,362 round brilliant diamonds set in a 36mm white-gold case and bracelet. And if that\u2019s not enough, the Carat 128 Facet watches \u2014 crafted in white and yellow gold \u2014 pay homage to the legendary 128.54-carat Tiffany Diamond, with a case back engraved \u201c727\u201d to honor the house\u2019s iconic NYC flagship.\n\nZenith Chronomaster Sport Rainbow Zenith\n\nEven Zenith jumped on the bling train with the Chronomaster Sport Rainbow, featuring baguette-cut sapphires and diamonds framing its bezel. As someone who\u2019s flirted with the idea of getting a Rolex Daytona (especially when you know the Zenith/Rolex history), this definitely scratches an itch for me and a lot of watch hunters.\n\nBut the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of the watch-jewelry hybrid? That title belongs to the newly unveiled Bvlgari Serpenti Tubogas and Serpenti Seduttori collections, now powered by the all-new BVS 100 Lady Solotempo \u2014 Bvlgari\u2019s first self-winding, time-only movement designed exclusively for its ladies\u2019 timepieces.\n\nBvlgari Serpenti Tubogas Bvlgari 1 / 3\n\nThis ultra-slim automatic caliber isn\u2019t just a technical flex; it\u2019s engineered specifically to fit the iconic Serpenti head motif, seamlessly fusing haute horology with haute joaillerie in the most dazzling way possible.\n\nBling is back in a big way, and it\u2019s not just for the boldest collectors anymore \u2014 it\u2019s for anyone looking to add a little (or a lot) of sparkle to their rotation.\n\nHublot Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic Green Saxem Hublot 1 / 10\n\nIf LVMH Watch Week 2025 is any indication, this year will be all about watches that flex \u2014 whether it's flexing heritage, flexing craftsmanship, or straight-up flexing wealth.\n\nNostalgia continues to pull at our heartstrings, and bling is making a full-fledged comeback.\n\nIn other words, the era of loud, in-your-face luxury isn\u2019t dead \u2014 it\u2019s just evolving.\n\nWant to keep browsing?

Credit: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nDiageo has unsurprisingly refused to be drawn on a Bloomberg report that the company is reviewing its stake in Mo\u00ebt Hennessy and weighing up the future of beer business Guinness.\n\nAccording to unnamed sources cited by Bloomberg, the UK-listed drinks giant is studying a range of options for both assets as part of a wider review of its portfolio.\n\nDiageo has owned a 34% stake in Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, the drinks division of luxury-goods group LVMH, since 1994.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s sources said Diageo could look to up its shareholding or leave the venture.\n\nThe publication said the company is also looking at the idea of listing or selling its Guinness unit.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t comment on market rumour,\u201d a Diageo spokesperson told Just Drinks.\n\nShares in Diageo stood at 2,501.5p, up 4.16% on the day.\n\nThe positions of the Mo\u00ebt Hennessy stake and of Guinness in the Diageo portfolio have periodically been the subject of market speculation.\n\nIn December 2023, Axios reported Diageo was seeking to sell a clutch of assets in beer but retain Guinness, its flagship brand in that sector.\n\nAt the time, Diageo had no plans to divest any of its beer brands.\n\nLast year, the company sold its majority stake in African unit Guinness Nigeria to Singapore-based conglomerate Tolaram.\n\nIn a note to clients, published earlier today, Bernstein Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale analyst Trevor Stirling said previous Diageo CEOs had \u201cmade no secret of the fact that they would be delighted\u201d to take full control of Mo\u00ebt Hennessy.\n\n\u201cHowever, achieving agreed terms has always appeared problematic, even if LVMH were willing to sell,\u201d Stirling said. \u201cSuch a deal would severely stretch the Diageo balance sheet, possibly necessitating a very reluctant disposal of beer/Guinness.\u201d\n\nIn recent quarters, Diageo has offloaded a clutch of spirits brands. Yesterday, the company sold Cacique rum to French spirits business La Martiniquaise-Bardinet.\n\nIn July last year, the group sold its Safari liqueur brand to Portuguese spirits group Casa Redondo, for an unknown sum.\n\nLater that same month, Diageo announced the sale of Pampero rum to Italian food spirits giant Gruppo Montenegro, as it looked to focus on the \u201ccore areas of strength\u201d in its portfolio.\n\nBefore Christmas, Diageo declined to comment on a report the company planned to offload its C\u00eeroc vodka brand following the end of a tie-up with rapper Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs.\n\nDiageo reported its preliminary 2023/2024 results in July, marked by a \u201cchallenging year\u201d as volumes dropped 3.5%, including declines for C\u00eeroc.\n\nBoth reported and organic growth declined, by 1.4% and 0.6% respectively, to register revenue of $20.3bn.\n\nIn the final numbers detailed in the annual report, volumes were down 5% on a reported basis at 230.5m equivalent units (EU). Both organic and reported sales revenue fell 1%.\n\nOperating profit was up 8% reported but was 5% lower in organic terms, while earnings per share dropped 12% to $173.2.\n\nDiageo is scheduled to report its half-year results on 4 February.",

            "content": "Since October's results release, ASML ( ASML ) stock has struggled to regain ground, leaving it just less than 2% in the green over the past year.\n\nAs for its results in the third quarter, ASML delivered total net sales of \u20ac7.5bn, which was up on the previous quarter. For the full 2024 fiscal year, ASML said it expected total net sales of around \u20ac28bn.\n\nHe said that the company expected its gross margin to come in between 51% and 53%, which was also below the range it provided in 2022. Fouquet said this was \"mainly related to the delayed timing of EUV [extreme ultraviolet lithography] demand\".\n\nChristophe Fouquet, CEO of ASML, said that the company expected total net sales of between \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn) and \u20ac35bn for 2025, \"which is the lower half of the range that we provided at our 2022 Investor Day\".\n\nIn addition, ASML cut its net sales forecast for 2025, which saw shares tumble.\n\nInvestors were rattled in October when the company released its results a day early , which was attributed to a \"technical error\".\n\nDutch company ASML is considered a bellweather for the global chip industry, so it's full-year results is likely to draw much market focus.\n\nHere's more on what to look for:\n\nMerger rumours have been swirling around miner Glencore ( GLEN.L ), which is due to release its year-end production report in the coming week.\n\nShell ( SHEL )'s latest quarterly results come as oil prices come under renewed pressure from comments by Trump on lowering prices.\n\nFollowing some positive news in the luxury sector, investors will be hoping LVMH ( LVMUY )'s results can add to optimism.\n\nChipmaker Intel ( INTC ) is due to report, as the company continues its search for a new CEO.\n\nIn terms of other earnings due out in the coming week, investors will be looking closely at the full-year results from ASML ( ASML ), as it manufactures lithography machines that are key to making chips and so is used to help gauge semiconductor demand.\n\nMarkets will also be watching what US president Donald Trump has on the policy agenda for his second week back in office.\n\nTesla ( TSLA ), Meta ( META ), Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Apple ( AAPL ) will be releasing results this week, attracting plenty of investor attention.\n\nThe \"Magnificent 7\" are set to dominate earnings focus in the coming week, as four of these tech giants are due to report, though there are still a number of other big names releasing results.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrump's approach to chip export policies is likely to be a key consideration for the company and the industry more broadly, given the Biden administration's efforts already to limit China's access to the technology.\n\nDutch prime minister Dick Schoof said in an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos that he expected Trump to keep pushing to restrict ASML's exports of machines to China.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration pushed very hard and I expect the Trump administration pushing the same way,\u201d he said.\n\nIntel (INTC) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter on Thursday 30 January\n\nChipmaker Intel (INTC) has suffered a series of struggles, which saw its shares sink last year and has left them down 55% on a one-year basis.\n\nBack in August, Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted from his role as Intel CEO last month, announced \"significant actions\" to reduce costs. He said the firm planned to deliver $10bn (\u00a38bn) in cost savings in 2025, which included reducing the company's head count by around 15,000 roles.\n\nIn the third quarter, Intel (INTC) beat expectations on revenue, which came in at $13.28bn, versus estimates of $13bn. However, the company posted a loss per share of $0.46, which was much worse than analyst expectations of $0.03.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nAt the same time, positive fourth quarter guidance and a beat on data center revenue, lifted Intel's shares.\n\nIntel (INTC) said it expects revenue to come in at between $13.3bn and $14.3bn for the fourth quarter, versus Wall Street estimates of $13.6bn.\n\nGelsinger then announced his exit in December and the company's board appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe company's board has also brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip (MCHP) chairman Steve Sanghi.\n\nYahoo Finance reported that there were a number of candidates at the centre of conversations to take on the role, though insiders said there were no clear frontrunners yet.\n\nMeanwhile, SemiAccurate recently reported that a mystery company is trying to acquire the company as a whole. A spokesperson for Intel declined to comment on the report.\n\nLVMH (MC.PA) \u2014 Releases full-year results on Tuesday 28 January\n\nLuxury stocks rallied on the back of Cartier-owner Richemont's (CFR.SW) latest trading update, which reported a surge in sales in the third quarter.\n\nThis sparked hopes of a turnaround for the luxury sector, which has been out of fashion with investor for some time. Companies have struggled as rising cost pressures on consumers forced them to rein in spending and brands have been particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\n\nHowever, Richemont's trading update lifted investor spirits and the share prices of Paris listed companies LVMH, Kering (KER.PA) and Herm\u00e8s (RMS.PA), as well as iconic British brand Burberry (BRBY.L) and Hong Kong-listed Italian company Prada (1913.HK).\n\nBurberry's third quarter update, released on Friday, added to optimism, after it reported better-than-expected festive sales.\n\nThis drove Burberry shares to surge nearly 13% on Friday morning, while Kering gained nearly 9% and LVMH was up 3%.\n\nRead more: 6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally\n\nAttention will now turn to LVMH's full-year results on Tuesday 28 January, with hopes that it will have seen some improvement since its third quarter results.\n\nLVMH reported a 3% drop in revenue in the third quarter to \u20ac19.08bn, dragging shares lower.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a tough period for luxury powerhouse, LVMH, with sales coming under pressure and missing market forecasts by a wide margin last quarter,\" said Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L).\n\n\"Price hikes in the Fashion and Leather goods division weren\u2019t enough to offset falling volumes, and Wines & Spirits continued to struggle against a backdrop of weak Chinese demand.\"\n\nHowever, Chiekrie said that the recent excitement around Richemonth had buoyed stocks in the stock, \"helping LVMH regain its spot as Europe\u2019s most valuable company.\"\n\n\"But whether LVMH can retain this crown will depend somewhat on its ability to meet market expectations, which are looking for full-year revenue to fall by no more than 2.2% to \u20ac84.3bn from next week\u2019s results, before returning to growth the following year.\"\n\nShell (SHEL.L) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter results on Thursday 30 January\n\nOil prices remain under pressure, with existing concerns about reduced demand, while comments from newly reinstated US president Trump have dragged on the commodity.\n\nIn a speech made remotely to the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump said that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, to bring down the price of oil.\n\n\"I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down,\" he said.\n\nThis prompted oil prices to slide, with brent crude (BZ=F) dipping back below $78 a barrel.\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said brent crude \"obediently followed president Trump\u2019s calls for lower oil prices\".\n\n\"However, there are signs of industry resistance building to his mandate to 'drill baby drill',\" he said.\n\nRead more: FTSE housing stocks set to benefit from property market rebound\n\n\"Such a move could undermine profitability for the industry and Rystad Energy and Wood Mackenzie are now forecasting that total US oil output in Trump\u2019s second term will rise by less than 1.3 million barrels a day. For now, a ninth consecutive fall in US inventories suggests that supply remains tight meaning that further dips in the price can\u2019t be assured.\"\n\nOil major Shell attributed its dip in earnings in the third quarter to lower refining margins, lower realised oil prices and higher operating expenses.\n\nShell reported that adjusted earnings fell by 4% on the second quarter from nearly $6.3bn, though this was strongly ahead of expectations.\n\nCommenting separately, Nathan said that Shell's recent trading statement \"revealed that while most business units have been trading broadly in line with previous guidance, the production and liquification ranges for integrated gas has been lowered.\n\n\"These are set to come in below third quarter levels, reflecting planned maintenance at its processing facility in Qatar, as well as the timing of shipments from offshore gas fields,\" he said. \"The weakness should be partially offset by an improved outlook for corporate costs.\"\n\nNathan added that investors will also be looking out for any comments on shareholder distributions, given Shell has announced buybacks of at least $3bn in each of the last 12 quarters.\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L) \u2014 Releases year-end production report on Thursday 30 January\n\nShares in miner Glencore recently ticked higher on reports that it had held early-stage talks with Rio Tinto (RIO.L) over a potential merger.\n\nReuters reported that that Glencore approached Rio Tinto late last year with a merger proposition but that discussions did not progress.\n\nIn addition, the report said that a Glencore spokesperson said the company was open to merger and acquisition transactions that create value for shareholders.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nSpokespeople for Glencore and Rio Tinto had not responded to Yahoo Finance UK's request for comment at the time of writing.\n\nGlencore reported lower production for copper, cobalt, zinc, nickel and thermal coal in the first nine months of the year.\n\nHowever, the miner said its outlook remained unchanged for 2024 overall for copper production, expecting between 950,000 and 1.01 million tonnes.\n\nGlencore also said it continued to expect marketing adjusted earnings before interest and tax for the full-year to be in the range of $3bn to $3.5bn. Glencore CEO Gary Nagle highlighted that this was around the top end of its long-term guidance range of $2.2bn to $3.2bn per annum.\n\nFollowing the release of Glencore's year-end production report next week, the company's preliminary annual results for 2024 are then due out on 19 February.\n\nOther companies reporting this week include:\n\nMonday 27 January\n\nDr Martens (DOCS.L)\n\nFanuc (6954.T)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nNucor (NUE)\n\nSofi Technologies (SOFI)\n\nSanmina (SANM)\n\nTuesday 28 January\n\nIdox (IDOX.L)\n\nAG Barr (BAG.L)\n\nHarworth Group (HWG.L)\n\nPets at Home (PETS.L)\n\nSSP Group (SSPG.L)\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nAtlas Copco (ATLPF)\n\nLogitech (LOGI)\n\nRTX (RTX)\n\nStryker (SYK)\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nChubb (CB)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruise (RCL)\n\nGeneral Motors Co (GM)\n\nKimberly Clark (KMB)\n\nArcher Daniels Midland adm (ADM)\n\nPackaging Corporation of America (PKG)\n\nF5 Networks (FFIV)\n\nQorvo (QRVO)\n\nWednesday 29 January\n\nAJ Bell (AJB.L)\n\nHardide (HDD.L)\n\nHargreaves Services (HSP.L)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nMeta (META)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nAdvantest (6857.T)\n\nTata Motors (TATAMOTORS.NS)\n\nVolvo AB (VOLV-B.ST)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nT-Mobile USA (TMUS)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD)\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nHess (HESM)\n\nCorning (OC)\n\nOtis Worldwide (OTIS)\n\nRockwell (ROK)\n\nTeradyne (TER)\n\nWestern Digital (WDC)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nThursday 30 January\n\n3i Group (III.L)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nBT Group (BT-A.L)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nSage Group (SGE.L)\n\nSt James's Place (STJ.L)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nWizz Air Holdings (WIZZ.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nRank (RNK.L)\n\nTakeda Pharmaceuticals (4502.T)\n\nAdani Ports (ADANIPORTS.NS)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nABB (ABBNY)\n\nBBVA (BBVA)\n\nCaixa Bank (CABK.MC)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nAltria (MO)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nCigna (CI)\n\nFerrari (RACE)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC)\n\nMicrochip (MCHP)\n\nL3 Harris (LHX.MX)\n\nDow (DOW)\n\nFriday 31 January\n\nChevron Corp (CVX)\n\nFujitsu 6702 (6702.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nTDK (6762.T)\n\nMitsui OSK (5273.T)\n\nSamsung Electronics (005930.KS)\n\nNovartis (NOVN.SW)\n\nExxonMobil xom (XOM)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nPhillips 66 (PSX)\n\nLyondellBasell (LYB)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nRead more:\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

            "content": "LVMH Watch Week touched down in New York, further cementing the importance of the American market in the world of luxury horology.\n\nOriginally slated to bow in Los Angeles, the sixth edition of the event quickly pivoted to New York and Paris in response to the devastating wildfires that the city continues to face.\n\nThe 2025 edition marked an important next step for the event bringing nine brands \u2014 several for the first time \u2014 under the LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton stable together on 57th Street for an exclusive first look at the latest creativity and technical feats that embody the savoir-faire of each maison.\n\nLouis Vuitton hosted attendees in a private salon inside its extensive temporary flagship space, debuting the Tambour Taiko Spin Time, a new collection of limited-edition watches using the Spin Time complication. Made up of six limited-edition models, the Tambour Taiko Spin Time collection is the first to be entirely powered by in-house movements developed by La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nThe brand\u2019s second debut, Tambour Convergence, brought together the Louis Vuitton ateliers in Geneva \u2014 La Fabrique du Temps, movement design; La Fabrique des Bo\u00eetiers, case making, and La Fabrique des Arts, rare handcrafts, showcasing the delicate dance of beauty, history and technical might in a timepiece. A \u201cdragging indication\u201d of hours and minutes, read at the conjunction of two rotating discs with a gold or platinum lozenge marker with guichet that frames the time indication, was inspired by the decorative arabesques found in the interior architecture of the Louis Vuitton family home in Asni\u00e8res, France.\n\nIn the same private space, independent watchmakers incubated by La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton, Daniel Roth and Gerald Genta each showcased new novelties as well.\n\nJust down the street at The Landmark, Tiffany & Co.\u2019s flagship and largest store globally, played host to multiple brands, serving as the centerpiece for the event over two days. The American brand seized the opportunity to affirm its long history of watchmaking, showing its commitment to the category with several \u201cwow\u201d moment creations that married its legacy in jewelry with contemporary timepieces.\n\nTiffany & Co.\u2019s presentation at LVMH Watch Week in New York.\n\nCase in point, the Carat 128 Aquamarine Watch, inspired the Tiffany Diamond with a cushion-shaped case, faceted on the front, reminiscent of the form of the precious gemstone and creating a unique geometric silhouette. A second version, The Carat 128 aquamarine high jewelry watch, is a one-of-a-kind piece featuring a 27mm diamond-set case in 18-karat white gold, with a total of 897 diamonds totaling more than 29 carats set on its case and five-row bracelet.\n\nAcross the street at Bulgari, the Lunar Year of the Snake was top of mind, with chief executive officer Jean-Christophe Babin teasing that there is much more to come at the Watches and Wonders fair in Geneva. In Manhattan, the starring role went to the new in-house Lady Solotempo BVS100 Automatic movement. \u201cThis innovation targets a new clientele, particularly women who are increasingly interested in mechanical watches,\u201d the executive said.\n\nThe CEO said the design has garnered interest from other brands within the LVMH stable and the Roman jeweler is keen to share its expertise and expressed excitement what that could mean for the broader watch group moving forward.\n\nCEO of Tag Heuer Antoine Pin recently moved over from Bulgari and he made a point to highlight that the American market is the brand\u2019s largest. He has motorsports on his mind, a sport the brand has a deep history with, now returning as official timekeeper for Formula 1 on Jan. 1 as part of LVMH\u2019s 10-year global partnership deal inked in October. Watch Week saw the brand debut five new timepieces in the Tag Heuer Formula 1 collection \u2014 four chronographs and the Tag Heuer Formula 1 Chronograph x Oracle Red Bull Racing.\n\n\u201cFormula 1 represents the essence of Tag Heuer\u2019s DNA \u2014 technology, boldness and the constant drive to defy one\u2019s own fears and surpass the limits,\u201d Pin said.\n\nDespite the challenges of 2024, Tag Heuer demonstrated \u201cremarkable resilience,\u201d and the CEO feels optimistic about the year ahead. \u201cOur confidence first lies in the strength of our brand and its equity, built on over 160 years of heritage and innovation. This unique balance of timeless craftsmanship and cutting-edge technology resonates with a global and diverse audience,\u201d he said.\n\nZenith\u2019s Rainbow Chronomaster\n\nA year into the role, Zenith CEO Benoit de Clerck is gearing up for a milestone anniversary for the brand, marking 160 years. One of the debut styles at Watch Week paid homage to its history of chronographs. Reimagining in rainbow gemstones the 41mm Chronomaster Sport case, it was crowned by a bezel set in \u201cRainbow\u201d style with 50 baguette-cut gemstones, 40 sapphires and 10 diamonds, highlighting the watchmaker\u2019s gem-setting expertise.\n\nDe Clerck sees the American customer as \u201csophisticated and changing,\u201d adding that \u201cmany brands are very show off\u201d but he sees a U.S. consumer looking for authenticity. That suits him just fine, labeling Zenith as \u201ca brand for people in the know.\u201d\n\nHublot also mined its heritage, marking the 20-year anniversary of The Big Bang collection, returning with the Big Bang Meca-10 with an optimized calibre in a more compact 42mm case in king gold, titanium and frosted carbon. \u201cWith this celebration, Hublot wants to deliver the message that we are committed to pushing the boundaries of watchmaking through our unique approach of combining traditional craftsmanship with cutting-edge technology and innovation,\u201d CEO Julien Tornare said.\n\nL\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e 1839, acquired by LVMH in summer 2024, made its Watch Week debut with a clever take on a watch box, a storing and displaying case that turns the watch it contains into an art piece.\n\n\u201cThese are not toys, we are making objet d\u2019art,\u201d CEO Arnaud Nicolas explained.\n\nThe Swiss clockmaker fields quite a lot of bespoke orders, Nicolas reported. \u201cIf it is a technical challenge, we never say no, but it has to fit into our way of thinking and DNA,\u201d he said.",

Each creation highlights Tiffany\u2019s legacy of excellence and creativity, with intricate details that capture both artistry and innovation.\n\nCarat 128 Aquamarine Watch: A Tribute to Iconic Brilliance\n\nThe Carat 128 Aquamarine Watch is a breathtaking homage to Tiffany\u2019s mastery in jewelry design. Drawing inspiration from the legendary Tiffany Diamond, this one-of-a-kind timepiece features a 27 mm 18k white gold case set with 897 diamonds totaling nearly 29 carats. Its centerpiece is a mesmerizing 35.23-carat aquamarine crystal, precisely faceted to emulate the geometry of the Tiffany Diamond.\n\nThe snow-set dial, adorned with 382 diamonds, is complemented by an 18k white gold crown featuring nine additional diamonds. Completing the design is a five-row bracelet, inspired by Tiffany\u2019s six-prong engagement ring setting, showcasing 251 diamonds totaling 28 carats.

Hour markers crafted from 12 uniquely cut diamonds further enhance its elegance. Powered by a Swiss automatic movement with a 38-hour power reserve, the Wisteria Watch seamlessly marries aesthetics with precision, celebrating Tiffany\u2019s creative heritage in every detail.\n\nBird on a Rock Watch: A Whimsical Reimagining\n\nJean Schlumberger\u2019s playful design legacy is beautifully captured in the Bird on a Rock Watch collection.

The 18k white gold case is adorned with 413 diamonds, while the central dial and bird design incorporate pink sapphires and diamonds for added charm. Both models highlight innovative engineering, such as ball-bearing mechanisms, paired with Tiffany\u2019s exquisite craftsmanship.\n\nTwenty Four Stone Watch: A Tribute to Schlumberger\u2019s Legacy\n\nThe Twenty Four Stone Watch honors Jean Schlumberger\u2019s timeless Sixteen Stone collection.

Domestic sales, within France, are down 7.2% compared to 2023. Only 153.2 million bottles were exported, while 118.2 million bottles were sold within France.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cChampagne is a true barometer of consumer mood,\u201d said Comit\u00e9 Champagne co-president Maxime Toubart in a statement. \u201cAnd this is no time for celebration, with inflation, conflicts around the world, economic uncertainty and a political wait-and-see attitude in some of Champagne\u2019s biggest markets, such as France and the United States of America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFellow Comit\u00e9 Champagne co-president David Chatillon emphasized that while the industry was experiencing a \u201cless favorable\u201d market, champagne remains a \u201csolid, sustainable organisational model.\u201d Chatillon also noted the need for the industry to continue seeking new markets and working towards \u201csustainable development.\u201d\n\nAside from the globally dismal mood, declining champagne sales are in keeping with other trends in the luxury goods market. According to the Bain & Company\u2019s annual luxury report, the industry as a whole declined in 2024, as China and South Korea both experience challenging economic headwinds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe consulting group\u2019s analysis, in conjunction with Italian luxury goods body Fondazione Altagamma, predicted a 2% dip in the market last year. Only one third of luxury retailers were expected to see positive growth in 2024, compared to two thirds of brands in 2023.",

            "content": "Hublot has announced details of eight new watches launching at LVMH Watch Week 2025, from a serpentine chronograph to a vibrant green sapphire-cased tourbillon.\n\nTrue to form, the brand\u2019s first launches of the new year come big, bold and plentiful in number. Between them they manage to touch on everything we know and expect from Hublot: mechanical intricacy, impactful colour and decoration, and otherworldly materials.\n\nStarting with the most timely \u2013 as the Lunar New Year, often also referred to as the Chinese New Year, will be celebrated on 29 January 2025 \u2013 we have the Hublot Spirit of Big Bang Year Of The Snake edition. Hublot has marked the last four lunar new years with limited-edition watches, each themed around the animal associated with that year under the Chinese zodiac system. As 2025 ushers in the year of the snake, Hublot takes the opportunity to coil a gold-coated snake around the chronograph subdials of a Spirit of Big Bang, which has also had its ceramic case and rubber strap embossed with reptilian scales.\n\nThe 42mm watch \u2013 which is almost entirely monochrome, apart from the rose gold hour markers, hands and snake \u2013 sits alongside three other Spirit of Big Bang debutantes. These draw on Hublot\u2019s commitment to creating colourful ceramic alloys; these shades of beige, green and blue have all previously been available in the round-cased Big Bang, and are now available on the Big Bang\u2019s tonneau-shaped cousin. Each watch, including the Year Of The Snake Edition, runs on Hublot\u2019s HUB4700 chronograph movement, which is a repurposed version of sister brand Zenith\u2019s El Primero 3600. As such, it beats at 5Hz, enabling measurements down to a tenth of a second. All three ceramic models are limited to 200 pieces; the Year Of The Snake model will be an edition of 88 pieces.\n\nAnother material that Hublot is revisiting for 2025 is SAXEM, a proprietary form of solid sapphire crystal. Standing for sapphire, aluminium oxide and rare earth mineral, SAXEM introduces colour at a scale and sturdiness that would be impossible with pure gemstones, by virtue of adding trace quantities of rare earth elements. SAXEM was first used in the Big Bang collection in 2023, and this edition adds a rich emerald green to the library of possibilities.\n\nHublot Spirit of Big Bang Chronograph. View all Big Bang models (Image credit: Hublot)\n\nThe movement inside is Hublot\u2019s in-house automatic tourbillon calibre, featuring a one-minute tourbillon at six o\u2019clock with a 72-hour power reserve. Only 18 pieces will be made.\n\nLast but not least, Hublot has revamped its Meca-10 movement for use inside a smaller watch, giving us the Big Bang Meca-10 42mm. For the uninitiated, the Meca-10 is a hand-wound calibre first seen in 2016 that reorganised the layout of a traditional watch movement along angular, simple lines reminiscent of Meccano, while at the same time vastly improving efficiency and power reserve. The watch can run for more than ten days on a full wind; Hublot says it caps the power reserve officially at ten days because after that, daily accuracy can suffer. The power reserve is displayed on the skeletonised barrel at three o\u2019clock, with a digital display that shows the number of days remaining. Previous watches using the Meca-10 calibre were either 45mm Big Bang or Spirit of Big Bang models; now the brand has re-engineered the movement to fit in a 42mm watch.\n\nWallpaper* Newsletter Receive our daily digest of inspiration, escapism and design stories from around the world direct to your inbox.

As a brand whose marketing activities sometimes threaten to overshadow its technical prowess, Hublot\u2019s more colourful releases may get the lion\u2019s share of the limelight, but the Meca-10 is proof that the brand is serious about its own very particular approach to horology.\n\nhublot.com\n\nRead more news for LVMH Watch Week 2025\n\nHublot Spirit of Big Bang Year of the Snake.

Price hikes in the Fashion and Leather goods division weren\u2019t enough to offset falling volumes, and Wines & Spirits continued to struggle against a backdrop of weak Chinese demand.\n\nDespite the slowdown, there are some early signs of sentiment beginning to improve. Fellow luxury conglomerate, Richemont, recently kicked off earnings season with a bang, posting double-digit jewellery revenue growth driven by uplifts across both Europe and the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe excitement appears to have buoyed other names in the sector too, helping LVMH regain its spot as Europe\u2019s most valuable company. But whether LVMH can retain this crown will depend somewhat on its ability to meet market expectations, which are looking for full-year revenue to fall by no more than 2.2% to \u20ac84.3bn from next week\u2019s results, before returning to growth the following year.\n\nMeta, Q4 Results, Wednesday 29 January\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown: Meta has set itself apart among tech giants by turning AI investments into quick wins. Unlike cloud providers that sell AI capabilities, Meta focuses its efforts on enhancing its own products, driving higher ad revenue. It\u2019s also made a smart play to open source its models, allowing it to leverage the global developer community to fine-tune its technology.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the AI push comes cheap. Zuckerberg sees AI as a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and the spending reflects that ambition. Investment will be watched closely, with some $15bn needed to be spent over the quarter to achieve full-year spending plans. Investors, understandably cautious after Meta\u2019s past overspending on projects like the metaverse, will be laser-focused on investment plans for 2025.\n\nMicrosoft, Q2 Results, Wednesday 29 January\n\nMatt Britzman: AI investment and cloud performance will take centre stage when Microsoft reports its second-quarter results next week. After spending $20bn in the first quarter, management confirmed plans to sustain this investment throughout the year, bringing the fiscal 2025 total to $80bn, with over half allocated to the US. Rolling out data centres and expanding AI applications is no small feat, and investors will be watching to see if cloud growth justifies the spending.\n\nThe key metric to watch is Azure growth, expected at 31-32%. Microsoft has said more recently that its capacity constraints are resolved, so markets hope to get a better picture of current demand levels in the coming quarters. Beyond Azure, the rollout of Copilot will also be under scrutiny, with investors eager to see how product development and adoption are progressing after some criticism from peers.\n\nTesla, Q4 Results, Wednesday 29 January\n\nMatt Britzman: Donald Trump\u2019s election win has created a fresh buzz around Tesla, with hopes that deregulation could accelerate the path to full self-driving technology. Optimism has been tempered more recently as the outlook for fewer interest rate cuts creates a potential headwind. Higher rates challenge affordability in key markets like the US, where the auto and EV sectors already face demand pressure.\n\nTesla reports first-quarter numbers next week, and while delivery numbers fell slightly short of expectations, strong performance in the energy segment should offset the shortfall. Still, margin concerns loom as Tesla relied on aggressive incentives to boost sales late in the quarter. Looking ahead, 2025 is pivotal, either solidifying Tesla\u2019s promise or exposing shortfalls in the growth story. The refreshed Model Y was a crucial first step; next, investors want updates on the affordable model, and tangible progress in full self-driving technology.\n\nAmazon, Q4 Results, Thursday 30 January (estimated)\n\nMatt Britzman: Amazon ended the third quarter on a high note last November, setting an upbeat tone heading into its fourth-quarter results. As usual, AWS will be the cloud hanging over market sentiment \u2013 any growth materially above 19% should get a warm reception. Investors will also be tuned in for updates on AWS\u2019s AI initiatives and the eye-popping investment Amazon plans to spend in the space.\n\nMeanwhile, let\u2019s not forget Amazon\u2019s trusty old e-commerce arm, often overshadowed by its cloud cousin. For the first time in a while, it\u2019s showing signs of life, with fresh initiatives like the discount storefront \u2018Amazon Haul\u2019 helping expand its reach. If Amazon can fine-tune automation, there\u2019s potential for some tasty margin expansion too.\n\nApple, Q1 Results, Thursday 30 January\n\nMatt Britzman: All eyes will be on Apple\u2019s iPhone sales in next week\u2019s first-quarter results. This period not only captures the crucial holiday season but also marks the first full quarter of iPhone 16 sales, bolstered by the rollout of Apple\u2019s new AI features.\n\nCompany guidance suggests low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth, but reaching the higher end of that range could prove challenging, with analysts forecasting growth of around 4%. Reports of a tough period for phone sales in late 2024 add to concerns, raising the potential for underwhelming iPhone performance. While Apple\u2019s new AI-driven features hold promise, the slow rollout, mixed early reception, and strong Chinese competition present some risk to the narrative that a major upgrade cycle is underway.\n\nCVS Group, Trading Statement, Thursday 30 January\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity analysis, Hargreaves Lansdown: Next week\u2019s trading update by CVS Group should give a steer as to whether growth has picked up towards the end of the first half, after soft demand in the UK led to flat like-for-like sales over the first four months of the period.\n\nAny comments on the ongoing enquiry by the Competition & Markets Authority will also be seized upon, although we\u2019re not expecting the initial findings until later in the year.\n\nAnalysts will also be looking for an update on business in the increasingly important Australian division and whether there\u2019s been any change in the pace of acquisitions down-under, and whether debt-levels remain manageable as the group expands.\n\nShell, Full Year Results, Thursday 30 January\n\nDerren Nathan: Shell\u2019s recent trading statement revealed that while most business units have been trading broadly in line with previous guidance, the production and liquification ranges for integrated gas has been lowered. These are set to come in below third quarter levels, reflecting planned maintenance at its processing facility in Qatar, as well as the timing of shipments from offshore gas fields. The weakness should be partially offset by an improved outlook for corporate costs.\n\nAs ever investors are likely to have a watchful eye on the outlook for shareholders distributions, with buyback programs of at least $3bn announced in each of the last 12 quarters. Of course, no further payouts can be guaranteed. And with a new financial year underway expect an update on the company\u2019s capital allocation priorities.\n\nThis article has been brought to you in association with Hargreaves Lansdown.

The former West Wing adviser wore a Dior dark forest green skirt suit with a thin black belt and a coordinating beret-style hat to the Inauguration ceremony at the U.S. Capitol\u2019s rotunda. The timeless ensemble was inspired by Dior\u2019s fall 1950 haute couture collection. Arnault\u2019s daughter Delphine, who heads up Dior, no doubt approved of the style.\n\nMelania Trump wore a charcoal gray oversize Dior coat upon arrival at Dulles International Airport Saturday, and a black cashmere double-breasted cape-style coat to the wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery Sunday afternoon. Her stylist Herv\u00e9 Pierre\u2019s former business partner Nicolas Caito now works for Dior in Paris. Caito moved back to Europe after their company Atelier Caito for Herve Pierre was forced to close during the COVID-19 pandemic. The New York-based operation did not receive any federally funded small business assistance. But back to Ivanka\u2019s 1950-inspired skirt suit.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nIn covering the 1950 haute couture collections, WWD pegged Christian Dior\u2019s as part of the \u201cSupple Modern\u201d camp that was \u201ckeyed to contemporary life.\u201d Translation? \u201cIt means clothes for ease of movement in styles and fabrics geared to active life, travel, smaller homes, and fewer servants.\u201d (Yes, you read that last bit right.)\n\nIvanka Trump arrives for mass at St. Johns Church ahead of the President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Getty Images\n\nThe fact that the post World War II period of the 1950s signaled a transformative point in history and delivered optimism and revival is something that was said to be not lost on Ivanka Trump. And as any visitor to the U.S. National Parks can relate to, green can be a symbol of renewal and hope. Those two virtues were said to have resonated with Ivanka as her father and the country sets out on the next chapter in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner during the commander-in-chief inaugural ball.

This season a dandy spirit cross-pollinates workwear and streetwear ideas. Shapes and looks hybridize one another to spawn new pieces. A suit jacket is reimagined as a leather kimono, while a sculpted bomber jacket is ornamented with a yellow flower. An air of rockabilly and mod throughout the collection brings recurrent leopard print to different pieces. A new \u201cPhriendship\u201d motif features the designer duo\u2019s face profiles, materializing their creative union on bags and clothes. The shoes that punctuate flared pants in the silhouettes include the new LV ButterSoft sneakers in pillowy extra-soft leather.\n\n\n\nThe iconography of Louis Vuitton is re-imagined through Japanese motifs and techniques. The Dandy Monogram is elevated with shipp\u00f4 weaving, sashiko stitching ornaments denim, and a Cherry Blossom Damoflage embellishes a suit. Delicate pink flowers evoking the blossoming cherry trees in Japan brighten garments and accessories alike. A nod to the first collaboration between Pharrell Williams and Nigo for Louis Vuitton in 2004, the Millionaires 1.0 sunglasses return in cherry blossom pink, as does a fresh iteration of the Speedy. Another exceptional gilded version of the Speedy channels the art of kintsugi, while Speedy P9 bags have an origami-like grace. Trunks, the ultimate symbol of Louis Vuitton\u2019s travel savoir-faire, celebrate the meeting of French and Japanese craft. Pharrell Williams invited Japanese artist Azuma Makoto to reinterpret the Courrier Lozine 110 trunk in transparent versions containing fresh flowers, questioning eternity and life through the fragility of the ephemeral. A fitting tribute to the precious time needed for craft, and the memorable moments of a runway show.\n\n",

            "content": "Dozens of athletes who competed at the Paris Olympics this summer say the medals they\u2019ve worked so hard to win are not shimmering the way they once did.\n\nTo date, more than 100 athletes reported their medals were deteriorating, with bronze medals in particular flaking and rusting. The Monnaie de Paris, which minted the medals, attributed the damage to a varnish defect caused by new European Union regulations, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee promised replacements. The legendary French company behind the medal design \u2013 LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton \u2013 is working to distance itself from the situation. The company\u2019s Chaumet jewelry house created the Eiffel Tower-inspired medals and is catching some heat for their involvement.\n\n\u201cLVMH was not involved in the production of the medals and is not responsible for the varnish issues,\u201d a company spokesperson told the Times.\n\nWhy it matters: Saying \u201cwe\u2019re not involved\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re not responsible\u201d may be accurate statement but it\u2019s also a poor one, especially given how much the company flaunted its involvement in the medals.\n\nLVMH effectively branded themselves into the medals, positioning their craftsmanship as a central part of the Olympics\u2019 luxury appeal. And this controversy \u2013 and its rather terse response \u2013 has tarnished that moment in the sun.\n\nIt\u2019s true that LVHM didn\u2019t manufacture the medals, but the narrative loses that nuance because the company so effectively tied its name to the medals. The company, in a way, became a victim of its own success: they own the medals. Which means they own all of it.\n\nNow the public is seeing Olympic champions with rusty medals with LVMH\u2019s name all over it, even if only figuratively.\n\nMichael Payne, former IOC marketing strategist, summed it up well: \u201cObviously because it\u2019s the medal, it\u2019s super high profile and everyone is asking the question how does this happen and especially coming from LVMH, whose raison d\u2019\u00eatre is quality and precision.\u201d\n\nWhile no one can fault LVMH from trying to distance itself from the issues of the medal, their response failed to show empathy for the champions who are seeing the pinnacle of their life\u2019s work fade before their eyes.\n\nLVMH could have taken a more proactive stance, showing leadership and ownership \u2013 something that would align better with their brand\u2019s prestige.\n\nEditor\u2019s Top Reads\n\nBrands are scrambling to get out in front of the impact of the sweeping executive changes issued by President Donald Trump upon his return to the White House. The orders range from massive immigration changes and reconsideration of policies created under President Barack Obama and President Joe Biden, many of which will have important impacts on businesses of all kinds. The Wall Street Journal reported that JPMorgan Chase set up a \u201cwar room\u201d to assess impacts of new policies, while law firm Fisher Phillips launched an immigration hotline to address concerns about potential workplace raids. 3M is closely monitoring trade policy and updates on tariffs as half of its imports come from Mexico and Canada, the Journal reported. The comms must find a way to be part of whatever initiatives the brand implements to effectively respond to these governmental changes. Comms pros have a pulse on how these changes are going to affect their customers and bottom line, and how best to convey those impacts to stakeholders. Even if not done in a formal capacity, comms pros need to stay out in front of these executive orders and law changes to prepare for conversations with customers and stakeholders alike. How are you getting involved in these conversations?\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence in for Oscar contender \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d The film\u2019s editor, D\u00e1vid Jancs\u00f3, revealed that the sound editing team used AI technology, Respeecher, to enhance the Hungarian accents of lead actors Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones. Director Brady Corbet defended the decision, stating they used it \u201cwith the utmost respect for the craft\u201d to preserve the \u201cauthenticity\u201d of the performances, per NBC News. There\u2019s growing demand for transparency in how creative teams use AI, whether in films or marketing campaigns. The team behind \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d was upfront not only about using AI but also about how they used it. However, simply telling people you used AI won\u2019t eliminate all criticism. But explaining in detail how AI is used and, just as importantly, how it\u2019s not being used is vital in building trust. Learn from \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d\n\nMeta is offering up to $5,000 to \u201cBreakthrough\u201d creators in the United States who join Facebook and Instagram. The program is open content creators who are at least 18 years old, based in the U.S. and have never been on either Meta platform in the past. While Meta\u2019s post doesn\u2019t mention any other platforms by name, the timing makes it clear Mark Zuckerberg and team hope to capitalize on the uncertainty surrounding TikTok\u2019s future in the U.S. The Meta team has launched a series of TikTok-like features in recent days, ranging from a new CapCut-like video editing app to a shoppable affiliate link feature. The IG post grid is now rectangular, rather than square, mirroring the TikTok layout. The social media landscape is volatile right now. TikTok is back online in the U.S. for now, but for how long, anyone knows. Meta is still reeling from some of its controversial changes in recent weeks and it\u2019s not clear how users will respond. But nothing is standing still. The major players are all jockeying for position right now and it\u2019s impossible to know who will come out on top. Don\u2019t overreact but be open to new opportunities.\n\nCasey Weldon is a reporter for PR Daily. Follow him on LinkedIn.",

            "content": "Louis Vuitton continues to redefine luxury watchmaking with its latest unveilings at LVMH Watch Week, showcasing a blend of innovation, craftsmanship and artistry. The Maison\u2019s two new collections, the Tambour Convergence and the Tambour Taiko Spin Time, aim to exemplify modern horological ingenuity, offering unique interpretations of time display and case design. These timepieces pay homage to Louis Vuitton\u2019s legacy of fine craftsmanship while also pushing the boundaries of contemporary watch design, meant to captivate enthusiasts and collectors alike.\n\nLouis Vuitton Tambour Convergence\n\n1 of 7 2 of 7 3 of 7 4 of 7 5 of 7 6 of 7 7 of 7\n\nThe Louis Vuitton Tambour Convergence represents a milestone in the Maison\u2019s watchmaking legacy, offering a sophisticated blend of artistry and technical innovation. This collection introduces two models in pink gold and platinum, both featuring the distinctive dragging indication of hours and minutes via two rotating discs, marked by a lozenge crafted from precious metal. Inspired by the interplay of natural phenomena and architectural elements from the Louis Vuitton family home, the design integrates seamlessly with the technical prowess of La Fabrique du Temps, La Fabrique des Bo\u00eetiers and La Fabrique des Arts. Encased within a 37mm shell, the watch showcases an in-house automatic Calibre LFT MA01.01 movement \u2014 a debut achievement for Louis Vuitton\u2019s horological atelier \u2014 ensuring both precision and elegance.\n\nA hallmark of the Tambour Convergence is its meticulous craftsmanship. The platinum edition dazzles with 795 snow-set diamonds that create a surface of brilliance, complemented by a saffron sapphire on the open case back. Conversely, the pink gold model emphasizes a more personal connection with its polished finish that will develop a unique patina over time. Both models feature satin-brushed brass discs with galvanic treatments and impeccably printed blue numerals, encapsulating modern design ideals while paying homage to classic watchmaking aesthetics. From its sandblasted lugs to its sapphire crystal\u2019s metalized edges, every detail has been refined to balance artistry and technicality, making the Tambour Convergence a timeless addition to Louis Vuitton\u2019s horological portfolio.\n\nLouis Vuitton Tambour Taiko Spin Time\n\n1 of 9 2 of 9 3 of 9 4 of 9 5 of 9 6 of 9 7 of 9 8 of 9 9 of 9\n\nThe Tambour Taiko Spin Time aims to mark a new chapter for Louis Vuitton\u2019s signature jumping hours complication, an innovation first introduced in 2009. This avant-garde collection reimagines the Spin Time concept with six limited-edition models featuring two case sizes, 39.5mm and 42.5mm, crafted in 18k white gold. The mechanism employs three-dimensional cubes to display the hours, with the current hour highlighted by a contrasting light grey cube. The dials \u2014 dressed in a refined dolphin grey hue and complemented by hawk\u2019s eye elements \u2014 exemplify Louis Vuitton\u2019s meticulous attention to color and texture. The case design builds upon the sleek Tambour silhouette from 2023, introducing integrated lugs and a domed case back for a modern yet ergonomic profile.\n\nThe collection\u2019s standout model, the Tambour Taiko Spin Time Air, creates a \u201cfloating\u201d effect with its cubes seemingly suspended within the case, achieved through advanced engineering of the LFT ST13.01 movement. The jewelled edition elevates the aesthetic with over 1,000 diamonds and a hawk\u2019s eye chapter ring. Meanwhile, the Tambour Taiko Spin Time Air Antipode revolutionizes the worldtime display by combining the jumping hour mechanism with a novel dual-time zone feature, offering an intuitive way to track time globally. At the pinnacle of the collection is the Tambour Taiko Spin Time Air Tourbillon, merging the iconic Spin Time cubes with a mesmerizing flying tourbillon, a testament to the Maison\u2019s dedication to innovation and craftsmanship.

            "content": "Every January, the watchmaking maisons of Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy \u2014 TAG Heuer, Bulgari, Hublot, Zenith, G\u00e9rald Genta, Daniel Roth, Louis Vuitton itself, and now L\u2019Ep\u00e9e 1839 and Tiffany & Co. \u2014 set up shop in a major U.S. city to show off their new wares to the international press. It\u2019s an exciting time, with opportunities to view and touch the year\u2019s fresh crop of timepieces just as the watches are shipping to stores. With executives, designers and senior LVMH leadership on hand for interviews, it\u2019s also a chance to experience the watches on a more profound level, complete with deep dives into their backstory, inspiration and savoir faire.\n\nThis year, this miniature trade show is bigger than ever before. Despite being displaced to New York City at the eleventh hour due to the devastating Los Angeles wildfires, the excitement and optimism of the fair is palpable as L\u2019Ep\u00e9e 1839 and Tiffany & Co. join the fray for the first time. Louis Vuitton, meanwhile, continues to demonstrate its exceptional command of the haute horlogerie space as it explores the fringes of avant-garde watchmaking, while Zenith begins sharing its famed El Primero movement technology with other members of the group. With racing chronographs on offer from tool watch specialist TAG Heuer and a new movement from Bulgari ready for inclusion in the brand\u2019s famed Serpenti watches, 2025 is shaping up to be quite a thrilling year for watchmaking.\n\n\n\nBelow, we dive into our eight favorite releases from LVMH Watch Week 2025.\n\nTAG Heuer Formula 1 Chronograph Though TAG Heuer has numerous chronographs within its Formula 1 collection, it would seem that the brand\u2019s recently renewed sponsorship of Formula 1 racing provided an excellent opportunity to offer a fresh take on this automotive-centric complication. Available in four standard versions as well as a special-edition Oracle Red Bull Racing iteration, the new Formula 1 Chronograph features a redesigned case with several racing-derived touches: The 44mm titanium housing takes its shape from the nose of an F1 vehicle, while the bezel sides boast micro-perforations like those on brake discs. With improved ergonomics and an aluminum tachymeter bezel, the new model features a triple-register chronograph with a date display and outer 1/5th-seconds track powered by the TAG Heuer Caliber 16 automatic movement. With versions in brushed titanium as well as black DLC-coated titanium, there are options for everybody in what is sure to be a popular new entry point into the TAG Heuer universe. Diameter: 44mm Movement: TAG Heuer Calibre 16 automatic Water Resistance: 200m buy here: $4,700 \u2013 $5,450\n\nZenith Chronomaster Sport Rainbow You\u2019d have to be living under a horological rock not to have noticed the flurry of \u201crainbow\u201d-themed watches that seem to be popping up nonstop these past few years. While Rolex may have been early to this trend with its \u201cRainbow\u201d Daytona, that watch\u2019s \u201cunobtainium\u201d status has opened a void willingly filled by many other maisons. Zenith, whose Chronomaster Sport is similar to that highly desirable Rolex by virtue of its design and feature set, has released a new \u201cRainbow\u201d of its own, this time in 18K white gold. Measuring 41mm in diameter, its bezel is set with no fewer than 50 baguette-cut gemstones including colored sapphires and diamonds. (The diamonds mark the 1/10th-second intervals \u2014 a clever design touch that matches up with the hi-beat El Primero Cal. 3600\u2019s ability to track that same unit of time.) The black dial with its triple-register chronograph is further set with another 12 gemstones whose coloration lines up with the gems on the bezel. It\u2019s tough to argue with such an eye-catching object! Diameter: 41mm Movement: Zenith El Primero 3600 automatic Water Resistance: 100m buy here: $112,100\n\nHublot Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic Green SAXEM Ever the innovator in the realm of materials, Hublot\u2019s flagship piece for LVMH Watch Week 2025 is a deep green version of its Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic SAXEM. SAXEM, which stands for \u201cSapphire Aluminium oXide and rare Earth Mineral,\u201d originally developed for use in satellites, is similar to more conventional sapphire but features a four-sided structure and rare earth elements, giving it unique properties that Hublot has been able to harness to great horological effect. The new green version, a limited edition of just 18 pieces, measures 44mm in diameter and houses the MHUB6035 automatic movement that is visible beneath a smoked black sapphire crystal. Boasting a tourbillon, black Arabic indices, sword hands, and a mix of sandblasted and hand-decorated finishing techniques, the watch is completed by a black rubber strap as well as an additional green transparent strap. Diameter: 44mm Movement: Hublot MHUB6035 automatic Water Resistance: 30m buy here: $231,000\n\nLouis Vuitton Tambour Taiko Spin Time Air Antipode The original Louis Vuitton Spin Time \u2014 which uses a series of rotating cubes to display the time in the manner of an old-fashioned airport departures board \u2014 was an innovative sensation. Now, redesigned and featuring a newly developed movement from the mad geniuses at La Fabrique du Temps, the Spin Time is being offered in no less than six fresh references within the Tambour collection. Though each is special in its own right, including stunning gem-set examples, the Louis Vuitton Tambour Taiko Spin Time Air Antipode is a cut above its beautiful brethren. While the basic premise of spinning displays radiating outward from an inner dial remains the same, the Antipode replaces the spinning hour indices with the name of two cities, each of which are 12 hours apart. Thus, when the time is, say, 11 a.m. in Auckland, it is simultaneously 11 p.m. in London, which is easily gathered from the dial. Joined by a conventional minute hand as well as a special yellow local hour indicator, the Tambour Taiko Spin Time Air Antipode represents the birth of a fresh travel complication \u2014 and a highly useful one at that. Brilliant! Diameter: 42.5mm Movement: Louis Vuitton LFT ST12.01 automatic Water Resistance: 50m BUY HERE: $99,500\n\nG\u00e9rald Genta Gentissimma Oursin Fire Opal Vacationing on Corsica in 1994, celebrated watch designer G\u00e9rald Genta (inventor of the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak and Patek Philippe Nautilus) came upon a sea urchin that sparked an idea. His Oursin design \u2014 a round watch covered in tiny beads reminiscent of a sea urchin\u2019s body \u2014 was typical of the brilliant designer\u2019s playful timepieces. After acquiring Genta\u2019s namesake brand, Louis Vuitton reissued the Oursin in 2024 in three precious-metal versions. Now, a brand-new take in 3N yellow gold is making its debut: Measuring 36.5mm in diameter, it features 137 fire opal gems individually screwed into the case via 3N yellow gold pins. An orange carnelian dial with round yellow gold indices builds upon the fiery theme, which is inspired by the fire opal\u2019s natural surroundings. (The stone is formed in volcanoes in Mexico.) Powered by a modified Zenith Elite movement and paired to a black alligator leather strap, it\u2019s a beautiful new objet d\u2019art that just happens to tell the time. Diameter: 36.5mm Movement: Zenith Elite cal. GG-005 automatic Water Resistance: 30m Learn more here\n\nDaniel Roth Extra Plat Souscription Continuing on where the Tourbillon Souscription of 2024 left off, the new limited-edition Extra Plat Souscription pairs a yellow gold double-ellipse case with an ultra-thin movement from La Fabrique du Temps in a watch that echoes one of Daniel Roth\u2019s own designs from the early 1990s. At just 35.5mm in diameter and 7.7 mm thick, this gorgeous dress watch is a handsome unisex model whose gorgeous guillochage dial and in-house DR002 hand-wound movement with 65-hour power reserve are sure to delight (though only for a few buyers, as it\u2019s limited to 20 pieces). The devil, of course, is in the details: The dial, for example, requires some 10 hours of crafting on vintage lathes just for the guilloch\u00e9 work, with a clous de Paris base and a brushed chapter ring providing visual interplay that adds plenty of depth and interest. Simple (with its two hands) yet wonderfully intricate, it\u2019s a standout 2025 release and another example of Louis Vuitton\u2019s uncanny ability to produce superlative watches. Diameter: 35.5mm Movement: Daniel Roth DR002 hand-wound Water Resistance: 30m BUY HERE: ~$49,700\n\nL\u2019Ep\u00e9e 1839 Watch Box If you\u2019re looking for a high-end yet modern clock, chances are you\u2019ve considered something from L\u2019Ep\u00e9e 1839. Now owned by LVMH, the Swiss brand has been in business for close to two centuries and designs some of the most thought-provoking timepieces in the world. In addition to timekeepers themselves, however, it also makes interesting accessories such as watch boxes and stands. Its new Watch Box is one such creation, but don\u2019t let its straightforward designation fool you: Made from transparent acrylic, its housing features a mechanical \u201clift\u201d \u2014 push a button on the housing, and the lid opens as the lift elevates the watch to within easy reach. Close the lid, and the system rewinds itself, ready to receive the watch when you\u2019ve finished wearing it. Simple yet elegant and eye-catching, it\u2019s the perfect accessory for someone looking to house his or her prized horological treasure in style. Dimensions: 215mm (length) x 150mm (width) x 140mm (height) buy here: $12,000\n\n\n\nTiffany & Co. Bird on a Rock Tsavorite Watch Celebrating Tiffany & Co.\u2019s long relationship with celebrated French jewelry designer Jean Schlumberger, the new Bird on a Rock Tsavorite Watch takes a familiar motif from the brooch of the same name \u2014 that which held the famed Tiffany Diamond \u2014 and gives it horological form. Housed in a 39mm 18K white gold case, it features Schlumberger\u2019s famous bird (rendered in white gold, diamonds and pink sapphires) attached to an invisible track on the outer dial ring. As the wearer moves their wrist, the bird rotates freely around the dial, which is itself set with 36 baguette-cut tsavorites and 166 round full-cut diamonds. The bezel and lugs, meanwhile, are set with a further 413 round brilliant-cut diamonds. Powered by the Swiss-made Calibre LTM 2100 automatic movement with 38 hours of power reserve and paired to a dark green alligator leather strap, the Bird on a Rock Tsavorite Watch is exemplary of Tiffany & Co.\u2019s commitment to the marriage of gem-setting and horology in truly spectacular fashion. Diameter: 39mm Movement: LTM 2100 automatic Water Resistance: 30m LEARN MORE HERE\n\nBulgari Lady Solotempo BVS100 Movement The big news coming out of Bulgari this month isn\u2019t so much about a watch, but rather about what\u2019s inside it: Just in time for the Year of the Snake, the famed Roman jeweler is unveiling the Lady Solotempo BVS100 movement, a round automatic caliber developed in-house specifically for the snake-shaped Serpenti watch. Back in the mid-20th century \u2014 and long before Bulgari had developed into a full-fledged watchmaker with the capacity to develop its own record-breaking movements \u2014 the Serpenti was powered by calibers from the likes of Jaeger-LeCoultre, Movado, Audemars Piguet, Vacheron Constantin, and others. During the Quartz Crisis, however, there was little appetite to fit the lady\u2019s Serpenti with tiny hand-wound movements, which were losing ground to battery-powered versions. Now, the tiny BVS100 \u2014 which joins the brand\u2019s tourbillon and Piccolissimo hand-wound movements \u2014 is proliferating throughout the Serpenti collection, making its debut in seven Seduttori and two Tubogas references. Fitted with a snake scale-patterned winding rotor and visible via a sapphire caseback, the BVS100 represents a giant leap forward in Bulgari\u2019s path toward vertically integrated manufacture. bulgari",

            "content": "Louis Vuitton continues to elevate luxury watchmaking, unveiling two standout collections, the Tambour Convergence and Tambour Taiko Spin Time, at the much-anticipated LVMH Watch Week. These timepieces blend technical ingenuity, artistic mastery, and timeless design, showcasing the Maison\u2019s commitment to pushing the boundaries of contemporary horology.\n\nTambour Convergence: A Study in Artistry and Innovation\n\nThe Tambour Convergence introduces an exquisite harmony of craftsmanship and innovation, with two models crafted in pink gold and platinum. These timepieces feature a unique dragging indication of hours and minutes through rotating discs, marked by a lozenge made of precious metal. Inspired by natural phenomena and the architectural legacy of the Louis Vuitton family, the design pays homage to tradition while embracing modern aesthetics.\n\nEncased in a 37mm shell, the Tambour Convergence houses the in-house automatic Calibre LFT MA01.01 movement, a first for Louis Vuitton\u2019s horological atelier, ensuring exceptional precision.\n\nThe platinum version dazzles with 795 snow-set diamonds and a saffron sapphire on the open case back, exuding luxury at every angle. Meanwhile, the pink gold model offers a more understated allure, featuring a polished finish that develops a distinctive patina over time. Satin-brushed brass discs, blue printed numerals, and sandblasted lugs emphasize a seamless blend of artistry and technicality.\n\nEvery element, from the sapphire crystal\u2019s metalized edges to the sandblasted finishes, underscores Louis Vuitton\u2019s attention to detail, making the Tambour Convergence a remarkable addition to its watchmaking legacy.\n\nTambour Taiko Spin Time: Redefining the Jumping Hour\n\nThe Tambour Taiko Spin Time collection takes Louis Vuitton\u2019s signature jumping hour complication to the next level. With six limited-edition models in case sizes of 39.5mm and 42.5mm, crafted from 18k white gold, this range reimagines the Spin Time concept.\n\nAt the heart of this collection is the use of three-dimensional cubes to display hours. Highlighted by contrasting light grey cubes, the time-telling mechanism is as visually stunning as it is functional. The dolphin grey dials, enhanced by hawk\u2019s eye elements, showcase the Maison\u2019s meticulous approach to material and color selection.\n\nThe Tambour Taiko Spin Time Air model offers a \u201cfloating\u201d effect, with cubes suspended within the case\u2014a feat achieved through advanced engineering of the LFT ST13.01 movement. For those seeking unparalleled opulence, the jewelled edition features over 1,000 diamonds paired with a hawk\u2019s eye chapter ring.\n\nThe Tambour Taiko Spin Time Air Antipode introduces a revolutionary world-time display. Combining the jumping hour mechanism with dual-time zone functionality, this piece offers global travelers an intuitive way to track time. Topping the collection is the Tambour Taiko Spin Time Air Tourbillon, which merges the iconic Spin Time cubes with a flying tourbillon, reflecting Louis Vuitton\u2019s dedication to innovation and sophistication.\n\nInnovation Meets Legacy\n\nBoth the Tambour Convergence and Tambour Taiko Spin Time collections reflect Louis Vuitton\u2019s unwavering commitment to luxury and creativity. From groundbreaking in-house movements to breathtaking designs, these timepieces serve as a testament to the Maison\u2019s ability to merge traditional craftsmanship with forward-thinking innovation.\n\nWith the introduction of these collections at LVMH Watch Week, Louis Vuitton continues to define the future of haute horology. Enthusiasts and collectors alike can look forward to exploring these masterpieces as the Maison redefines how we experience time.\n\nStay connected for more updates on Louis Vuitton\u2019s horological endeavors and the latest releases from LVMH Watch Week.",

TAG Heuer is starting 2025 with a bang, marking its return as the Official Timekeeper for Formula 1 during the sport\u2019s 75th anniversary.\n\nThe new TAG Heuer Formula 1 Chronograph collection is a vibrant nod to racing culture, with lightweight titanium cases, bold tachymeter bezels, and eye-catching colors like red, lime green, and blue. There\u2019s also a special Oracle Red Bull Racing edition featuring a checkered flag pattern, carbon details, and a strap that mirrors the team\u2019s colors.\n\nThe Carrera Chronosprint x Porsche Rallye honors the 1965 Monte Carlo Rally with design touches inspired by the classic Porsche 911, down to the unique movement that mimics acceleration. For those watch enthusiasts who love bold colors, the new purple Carrera Chronograph and Tourbillon models are hard to miss, with their gradient dials and intricate detailing. TAG Heuer also adds a softer side with pastel Carrera Date models and diamond accents for a refined everyday look.

Nine LVMH watchmaking Maisons will showcase their latest creations during the events.\n\nAfter holding LVMH Watch Week in Dubai, Singapore and then Miami in 2024, LVMH has chosen New York and Paris to kick off 2025, bringing together its Maisons to bridge two continents that are central to the LVMH Group\u2019s DNA.\n\n\n\nCapitalizing on the success of previous editions, LVMH Watch Week 2025 takes the event, which has become a must on the watch industry calendar, to a new level this year. The prestigious Maisons that have regularly taken part in this event \u2013 Bvlgari, Hublot, TAG Heuer, Zenith, Daniel Roth and G\u00e9rald Genta \u2013 are joined in 2025 by three other iconic brands, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co. and L\u2019Ep\u00e9e 1839.\n\n\n\nThe New York event takes place in the heart of Manhattan at Tiffany\u2019s iconic flagship The Landmark on 5th Avenue, as well as the nearby Louis Vuitton and Bvlgari stores. In Paris, the LVMH Group\u2019s Cheval Blanc Paris hotel will provide an equally majestic venue to welcome the European press, joined by the stores of several Maisons.\n\n\n\n\u201cNew York to Paris is a perfect theme for this sixth edition of LVMH Watch Week, linking two essential regions for our Maisons and the LVMH Group. Our decision to organize Watch Week in the United States for the second consecutive year reflects the key position of this market, which remains at the core of our strategy, along with the deep and enduring ties we enjoy with our American customers and partners. We\u2019re also proud to welcome Tiffany & Co, Louis Vuitton and L\u2019Ep\u00e9e 1839 as new Maisons taking part in this 2025 edition, underscoring the importance of the gathering, which has become a premier event on the watch industry calendar,\u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, Chief Executive Officer of LVMH Watches.\n\n\n\nThroughout this sixth edition of LVMH Watch Week, each Maison will give attendees an exclusive look at its latest creations, spotlighting the tremendous creative dynamic across the Group\u2019s Watches division. Highlights include Bvlgari\u2019s Serpenti Seduttori collection, the Extra Plat Souscription from Daniel Roth, the Gentissima Oursin Fire Opal by G\u00e9rald Genta, Hublot\u2019s Big Bang Meca-10 collection, the Louis Vuitton Tambour Taiko Spin Time collection, TAG Heuer\u2019s Formula 1 Chronograph, the T35 collection from L\u2019Ep\u00e9e 1839, the Tiffany & Co. Jean Schlumberger collection and Zenith\u2019s Defy Skyline Skeleton Chronograph.\n\n\n\nThe United States plays a pivotal role in the luxury industry and constitutes a strategic market for LVMH and its Maisons. The LVMH Group counts over 43,000 employees and 1,128 stores in the United States. The country is a key growth driver for the Group and its Maisons, representing 25% of Group sales in 2023. Louis Vuitton, Dior and Sephora in particular all recorded robust performance in 2024 in the U.S., and the launch of the American whisky SirDavis is emblematic of LVMH\u2019s dynamic momentum and ongoing innovation in this market.\n\n",

Sign up here.\n\nThe fifth annual LVMH Watch Week is here\u2014and in my opinion, it\u2019s the best edition of the luxury giant\u2019s annual horology showcase yet. The conglomerate has steadily ramped up its watch production in recent years, solidifying the Louis Vuitton brand and acquiring impressive legacy names like Daniel Roth and G\u00e9rald Genta. All those investments are paying off in a big way this year, as the offerings from the fair\u2014running today and tomorrow in New York, before heading to Paris for January 30 and 31\u2014feel more expansive and impressive than ever. In 2025, Zenith is finding its well-appointed footing, Daniel Roth stole the show with a sleek and simple piece, and Louis Vuitton is asserting itself as a real player in the high-end watch game. See all of my favorite releases from LVMH Watch Week 2025 below.\n\nDaniel Roth Extra Plat Souscription\n\nDaniel Roth doesn\u2019t have the name recognition of a TAG Heuer or Louis Vuitton, but the brand\u2019s new timepiece is the one most worth paying attention to coming out of this fair. Founded in 1988, the brand was acquired by Bvlgari in 2000 before going dark shortly thereafter. Two years ago, Louis Vuitton announced that it was reviving Daniel Roth with input from its namesake but led by legendary watchmakers Michel Navas and Enrico Barbasini. DR launched its new era in 2022 with the Souscription Tourbillon. I love that watch, but there is undeniably a lot going on with it. Now, with the new Extra Plat version, the brand\u2019s designers have treated the Souscription like The Grinch, stripping the model of all baubles, pampoolas, bizzel binks, and even the last can of Who-Hash. Gone from the previous release are the tourbillon, the triple arc track, and even the seconds hand. What\u2019s left is a watch that makes my heart grow three sizes. This pared-down DR\u2014a reproduction of a watch released by the original Daniel Roth in 1990\u2014maintains the pretty Clou de Paris pattern on the dial, but there isn\u2019t much ornamentation beyond that. It\u2019s simply a perfect thin dress watch, measuring in at just 35.5 by 38.6 mm.\n\nZenith Chronomaster Sport Rainbow",

Horlogerie.\n\nThe CEOs and teams of LVMH\u2019s watchmakers. Katie Thompson/Courtesy of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton\n\nWhile the price point for these new timepieces is 2.5 times higher than its jewelry average \u2014 and higher by a similar factor to now-retired previous watch collections \u2014 this was driven by the increasing number of gem-set or complicated watches.\n\n\u201cWe are elevating the price points but it\u2019s more thinking in terms of designs and offer than just moving for the sake of being at a certain level,\u201d Ledru said.\n\nPrices continue to start around $5,000 for a silver watch from the HardWear line but increasingly reach in the six-figure territory with the introduction of, say, a model featuring a tourbillon complication or the Carat 128 Aquamarine Watch featuring a 34-carat faceted aquamarine as a dial sapphire.\n\nWatchmaking, initially a \u201cvery small percentage of the business,\u201d has been growing double-digit since the 2021 acquisition by LVMH, a rate Ledru expects to sustain over the next four to five years.\n\nWhile cautious, the executive said there was \u201cgreater confidence\u201d now that the U.S. election period was over. \u201cWe can hope for a better, stronger year in the Americas,\u201d Ledru said. \u201cWe are heavily dependent on what\u2019s happening in the U.S. historically \u2013 despite growing fast internationally \u2014 and it\u2019s still and will remain a sizable piece of our business.\u201d\n\nKey to an acceleration of the business globally will be the roll out of the Tiffany & Co. watch studio in a selection of flagships slated for renovation in the next five years. Among them will be the ones in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Calif., Sanlitun in Beijing, Milan\u2019s Via Montenapoleone and Ginza, Tokyo.\n\nMeanwhile, Louis Vuitton\u2019s first participation in LVMH Watch Week is about showing its high watchmaking chops to one of its biggest collector bases. After wiping the slate clean in 2023 and the 2024 relaunch of the Escale model, the year is shaping up to be \u201cthe biggest [one] in terms of repositioning,\u201d said director of watches Jean Arnault.\n\nTaking pride of place in the 10-strong lineup is the Tambour Taiko Spin Time, which revisits the Tambour family with a thinner case, reworked lugs and a new in-house self-winding mechanical movement. Among the standouts is the Antipodes variation, giving the time in two timezones, one in each hemisphere.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect to hear about a bigger number of watches, as \u201cVuitton is not a brand that needs to have a watchmaking offer that expands exponentially,\u201d said Arnault, who intends for the brand to keep to its current levels, favoring new releases by decreasing production on previous models.\n\n\u201cFor me, the main message that I would like people to remember [is that] a Vuitton watch is not a product under license, it\u2019s really an artisanal piece through-and-through,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, for the independent watchmakers incubated by La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton, the novelties imagined by master watchmakers Enrico Barbasini and Michel Navas highlighted each brand\u2019s forte.\n\nThe two-hand Daniel Roth Extra Plat Souscription is about \u201cabsolute classicism and continuing all details of the watch without being ostentatious.\u201d Conversely, the Gentissima Oursin Fire Opal nods to design pushed to its most exuberant, tapping into a 4,000-strong font of sketches left behind by the late G\u00e9rald Genta.\n\nDoubling down on house icons is also the driving idea at Bulgari. With the lunar Year of the Snake days away, highlighting the Serpenti line feels timely but \u201cthe snake is not tactical, it\u2019s the core of the brand,\u201d said CEO Jean-Christophe Babin.\n\nBut the important part of the Serpenti Seduttori collection is less its design than the new in-house Lady Solotempo BVS100 Automatic movement it launches.\n\nIt is a reaffirmation that Bulgari is \u201cnot only a jeweler but a true, serious, ambitious watchmaker,\u201d said the CEO, as evidenced by a series of records achieved with the Octo line and a regular production of chiming watches, a highly challenging complication.\n\nAll of these have contributed to momentum for Bulgari\u2019s watchmaking that it is keen to capitalize on, also leveraging being \u201ca truly feminine brand in a market where the feminine segment has been somehow neglected by the main pure players,\u201d for Babin.\n\nIn the U.S., the Roman house \u201creally has a card to play to become a very strong outsider,\u201d while its sales in China may benefit from government stimuli \u2014 \u201cif we are desirable and creative enough to capture part of this extra spending made locally,\u201d he cautioned.\n\nWith anniversaries and new partnerships aplenty, other LVMH watchmakers were likewise keen to highlight key design families.\n\nThe first participation of L\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e 1839 was less about novelty than about reinforcing the brand\u2019s presence with its American clientele, as the U.S. has long been a strong market for the brand, said CEO Arnaud Nicolas.\n\nThat said, it is sure to garner plenty of attention with the \u201cWatch Box,\u201d a storing and displaying case that turns the watch it contains into a part of this kinetic art piece.\n\nWith the U.S. still \u201can extremely dynamic market for Zenith, even in these contrasted times,\u201d CEO Beno\u00eet de Clerck remained confident both in the territory and for the year ahead as the brand enters its 160th year.\n\n\u201cSince 2022, we have entered a stronger position with solid growth that leveled off in 2024,\u201d he said. It will allow the brand to consolidate further and \u201cgrow responsibly\u201d this year \u2014 and the next 160.\n\nZenith premiered the Defy Skyline Chronograph Skeleton, featuring an El Primero 3600 movement in a bold skeletonized design, and the gem-set Chronomaster Sport Rainbow chronograph.\n\nThroughout this anniversary year, it plans to strengthen its U.S. distribution network, with plans geared toward \u201cfostering a deeper relationship with American watch enthusiasts and providing them with an immersive experience\u201d in Zenith.\n\nPutting pedal to the metal is Tag Heuer, who returned as official timekeeper for Formula 1 on Jan. 1 as part of LVMH\u2019s 10-year global partnership deal inked in October.\n\n\u201cThis reconnection with this iconic partnership offers an exceptional platform to showcase our expertise in precision timing while embracing the spirit of performance and innovation,\u201d said CEO Antoine Pin.\n\nIn pole position is the Tag Heuer Formula 1 Chronograph collection, which spans four pieces with a new case design and details reflecting the aerodynamic lines of the cars, including an Oracle Red Bull Racing special edition.\n\nThe ongoing partnership with the F1 racing team \u2014 and launches such as last year\u2019s collaboration with Kith introduced during the Miami Grand Prix weekend \u2014 \u201cunderscore our commitment to strengthening our presence in the U.S.,\u201d one of the brand\u2019s most dynamic markets, Pin said.\n\nFor Hublot, the star of the week is sure to be the Big Bang MECA-10.\n\nAs the Big Bang collection turns 20 this year, the watchmaker \u201cwants to deliver the message that we are committed to pushing the boundaries of watchmaking through our unique approach of combining traditional craftsmanship with cutting-edge technology and innovation,\u201d said Hublot CEO Julien Tornare.\n\nDescribing the U.S. market as \u201cextremely important\u201d and the Americas overall as key to the brand, he found \u201cthe enthusiasm and appreciation [for the brand] in this region is very encouraging.\u201d A slew of region-exclusive pieces and the reopening of its boutique on Fifth Avenue in New York are slated for later in the year.\n\nDespite the \u201cvaried performances in the global watchmaking industry,\u201d Tornare remained optimistic. \u201cThe recent Swiss watch export figures indicate a dynamic market, and we are prepared to navigate these challenging times with resilience,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Bulgari Seduttori Automatic\n\nImage Credit: Bulgari\n\nThe BVS100 Solotempo is a new automatic movement that Bulgari says was three years in development and will be rolled out across a range of LVMH watch brands. Its main feature is its slim profile, and in that sense it reflects Bulgari\u2019s mastery of micro-scale watchmaking as the holder of several world records for small movements. The BVS100 takes the concept and puts it into practical use with an automatic movement designed specifically to accommodate ladies-sized watches. \u201cThis new movement wll be part of the portfolio of Bulgari tomorrow,\u201d says Bulgari CEO Jean-Christophe Babin. \u201cMaybe others will follow, but the intent is that every movement that is going to go into what we call daily watches.\u201d\n\nIt follows in the footsteps of other ultra-slim movements for women including Jaeger-LeCoultre\u2019s famous caliber 101, which has served as a go-to tiny manual-wind caliber for ladies\u2019 cocktail and jeweled watches since 1929, except that the BVS100 is automatic. Bulgari says it created the BVS100 because \u201cno other movement on the market meets the size and volume criteria required to fit perfectly within the shape of the Serpenti head motif case.\u201d It measures 19 mm in diameter and 3.90 mm thick (the manual-wound JLC 101 measures 14 mm x 4.8 mm). Because the BVS100 is a small caliber, Bulgari wanted to optimize the power reserve, so they reduced the frequency to 3Hz compared to the standard 4Hz because energy consumption is lower, and it takes less effort to wind the mainspring because it requires less torque.\n\nAlthough the movement was developed at Bulgari\u2019s Le Sentier workshop, it is being manufactured by Zenith at its movement manufacture in Le Locle, and Bulgari says it will be included in the future catalog of in-house movements available to other LVMH group brands. \u201cThis movement will be shared across the other brands, which for us drives scale,\u201d says Babin. \u201cFor the next two, three years, Bulgari will produce it for the Tubogas and the Seduttori. However, with the capacities of our sales, if tomorrow we need to do it for other maisons, we need more, we can increase our capabilities.\u201d It is the first automatic movement for the Serpenti collection, which was previously quartz, and the collection\u2019s cases had to be enlarged slightly to accommodate the new movement, but only by 2 mm. The thickness of the case in the quartz version is 7 mm and, with the automatic movement, the case is 9 mm.\n\nQuartz options will still be available, says Babin, possibly in the steel models. Gold models will always have automatic movements, with diamond bezels. Since this is the Chinese year of the snake, Bulgari has chosen to debut the BVL100 in the Serpenti collection, in Seduttori and Tubogas models.\n\nPrice: $36,700 in yellow or pink gold; $16,800 in two tone; $10,200 in steel\n\nCase Material: Red gold, yellow gold, white gold, two-tone gold and steel or steel\n\nCase Size: 34 mm; Tubogas 35 mm",

X/Yohann Ndoye Brouard\n\n5 The medal shows considerable rust just months after it was handed out. X/Yohann Ndoye Brouard\n\nThe Monnaie de Paris, the French mint responsible for producing the medals, has admitted to a technical flaw in the varnish applied to prevent oxidation.\n\nThe organization cited a change in its formula due to recent European Union regulations banning the use of chromium trioxide, a chemical previously used to protect against rust.\n\n\u201cThat responsibility lies solely with La Monnaie de Paris and the International Olympic Committee,\u201d an LVMH spokesperson told The Post, adding: \u201cLVMH has no connection to this aspect of the process and will not be commenting on this matter.\u201d\n\nLVMH, which is controlled by the family of multibillionaire Bernard Arnault, was a major sponsor of the Summer Games in Paris.\n\nThe backlash began when French swimmers Cl\u00e9ment Secchi and Yohann Ndoye-Brouard posted photos of their bronze medals on social media, revealing a surface that appeared to be peeling.\n\nSecchi described the medal as resembling \u201ccrocodile skin.\u201d\n\n5 Nick Itkin, a US Olympian, also posted pics of his rusting bronze medal. Instagram/Nick Itkin\n\n5 The medals were designed by LVMH jeweler Chaumet. Instagram/Nick Itkin\n\nThe company made its presence felt during the competition \u2014 from outfitting athletes to supplying Mo\u00ebt & Chandon champagne in VIP lounges.\n\nNick Itkin, a US Olympic fencer, also reported that his bronze medal had begun to deteriorate just days after receiving it.\n\nThis is not the first time that Olympic medals handed out to athletes have fallen apart.\n\n5 Antoine Arnault, son of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, is seen above during the unveiling of the Olympic medals last year. TERESA SUAREZ/EPA-EFE / Shutterstock\n\nAfter the 2016 Rio Olympics, approximately 6,000 medals had to be replaced due to defects, including rusting, flaking coatings, and black spots appearing on the surfaces.\n\nThe Brazilian mint, which produced the medals, attributed the issues to extreme heat, handling conditions and flaws in the manufacturing process.\n\nDuring the Paris Games, Chaumet, which is known for its exquisite craftsmanship, refined designs and deep ties to European royalty, showcased the yearlong effort to craft the medals, which included incorporating a piece of the Eiffel Tower at the center of each award.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop the bronze medals from rusting.\n\nThe medals began showing signs of deterioration shortly after being awarded this past summer.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee has since issued an apology and pledged to provide replacements.",

            "content": "Returning to LVMH Watch Week this year, Zenith has unveiled two remarkable iterations of its iconic timekeepers. Shifting its focus from the Defy model in 2023 and the Chronomaster in 2024, the Swiss watchmaker is now spotlighting both series equally with the introduction of the new Defy Skyline Chronograph Skeleton and Chronomaster Sport Rainbow.\n\nDefy Skyline Chronograph Skeleton\n\n1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5\n\nJoining Zenith\u2019s Defy Skyline collection is a duo of skeletonized chronographs that embodies a sport-luxe appeal. Clad in stainless steel, the new Defy Skyline Chronograph Skeleton arrives in its usual octagonal case, measuring 42mm in diameter. It proudly wears its mechanical prowess on its face in the form of an openworked dial, offering a clear view of the El Primero 3600SK movement. Synonymous with previous Defy Skyline references, the caliber can also be admired through the open caseback alongside its star-shaped oscillating weight.\n\nComing in black and blue, the timepiece is priced at $15,500 USD and is accompanied by a steel bracelet alongside an additional rubber strap that matches its respective dial.\n\nChronomaster Sport Rainbow\n\n1 of 4 2 of 4 3 of 4 4 of 4\n\nZenith has shown an experimental spirit when it comes to introducing eccentric builds for the Defy series, but rarely does it dabble its hands in the sphere of gem-set novelties. Last year, the Maison introduced its first-ever bejeweled Chronomaster Sport, which starred a rose gold build with blue, dark gray and silver-gray gems. Building on that particular model\u2019s success, Zenith takes the luxurious and colorful concept up a notch with the Chronomaster Sport Rainbow \u2014 which, as its name suggests, features rainbow-colored gemstones.\n\nThe gem-set bezel and baguette-cut sapphire indices echo one another in a full rainbow spectrum. This is paired with a black lacquered dial plate, which allows the vibrant gems to shine without distraction. Meanwhile, the subdials are doused in blue, dark gray and silver-gray, echoing the Chronomaster model\u2019s iconic tri-color palette.\n\nPriced at $112,100 USD, the timepiece is housed in a 41mm-sized case, which is composed of 18-carat white gold and is paired with a matching white gold bracelet. It\u2019s geared with a 60-hour power reserve and runs on Zenith\u2019s prized El Primero 3600 movement.\n\nHead over to the brand\u2019s official website for more details regarding Zenith\u2019s new novelties from the event.

            "content": "LVMH's Watch Week has become something of an institution, with the group\u2019s stable of brands combining to own the airwaves, ahead of shows such as Geneva\u2019s Watches and Wonders (where most of the brands still take part). It\u2019s also an opportunity to get a first sight of the watch trends that will dominate the year ahead (check back to LVMH Watch Week 2024).\n\nLast year was a tough year for the industry as a whole, thanks to the usual array of geo-economic headwinds not to mention the tail end of the Covid hangover. That said, LVMH has reasons to be cheerful as brands all had positive developments to report. Keep an eye on this frequently updated guide for all the news from LVMH Watch Week 2025, kicking off 21 January in New York (moved from Los Angeles due to the LA fires) and with a European leg in Paris.\n\nLVMH Watch Week 2025\n\nTag Heuer\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of brand)\n\nClearly, the biggest news for 2025 is TAG Heuer\u2019s new status as Official Timekeeper for F1. The watchmaker is nothing if not a motorsport brand, and with the new status comes a new Formula 1 Chronograph collection. Designed to capture the spirit of extreme engineering that the cars represent, the Formula 1 chronographs feature titanium cases, aluminium and forged carbon bezels, hands and hour markers coated in NAC ceramic. In a suitably 80\u2019s manner, the black dials and cases are contrasted with pops of bright colour not just on the dial but on the crown and edges of the straps.\n\nSee Tag Heuer's new collections at LVMH watch week\n\nZenith\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of brand)\n\nOne of the more surprising launches of Watch Week is Zenith\u2019s Chronomaster Sport Rainbow in white gold. It brings together one of Zenith\u2019s most enduring legacy designs and the name of one of the brand\u2019s most sought-after watches but whereas the 1997 Rainbow was almost purely monochrome (bar three sectors on the minute counter), the 2025 watch is set with 50 baguette-cut diamonds, spinels and sapphires that create a rainbow spectrum around the dial and on the hour markers.\n\nTiffany & Co\n\n(Image credit: Tiffany & Co)\n\nThis year sees the most comprehensive watch collection from Tiffany & Co since the 2021 acquisition, with the most characteristically Tiffany design being the Jean Schlumberger inspired piece. Derived from a 1959 design, the watch dial features a rotating ring decorated with a cross-stitch motif in 18k yellow gold and is set with 707 diamonds totalling more than 6.5 carats. Heritage and modernity unite in the piece, with the cross-stitch motif inspired by Schlumberger's origins from a family of Alsatian textile manufacturers.\n\nBulgari\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of brand)\n\n2025 is the Year of the Snake, so no real surprise that Bulgari lead off with an update for the Serpenti, the mid-Century design that\u2019s most distinctively Bulgari. For the first time, the Serpenti gets an automatic movement designed specifically for the case shape and is released in both Sedutorri (where the case is integrated with a serpent scaled bracelet) and Tubogas (the open ended, double-wrap bracelet) forms. \u201cMore than an icon: a signature\u201d says Fabrizio Bounamassa Stigliani, Bulgari\u2019s Executive Director of Watch Design.

Inspired by the old mechanical displays used at airports and train stations, the Spin Time was the first movement designed for Louis Vuitton\u2019s La Fabrique du Temps and, for the first time, sits on top of Louis Vuitton in-house movements, including a world timer and a central tourbillon.\n\nHublot\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of brand)\n\nHublot\u2019s cascade of launches starts with a Big Bang Tourbillon cased in emerald-green Saxem, a sapphire like material that\u2019s enhanced with rare thulium and holmium, that give it an enhanced brilliance. There is also the return of the Meca-10 in a more compact 42mm case in the typically Hublot material mix of King Gold, Titanium and Frosted Carbon. Inspired by Meccano-type construction systems, the MECA-10 is an exercise in creative micromechanical design.\n\nSee all of Hublot's new collections at LVMH Watch Week 2025",

Concerns that the US government will push down prices for its weight loss drugs, including Wegovy and Ozempic, through Medicare's new pricing negotiations. Meanwhile, LVMH has been riding high, up nearly 9% over a month. The broader luxury sector got a boost from Richemont's stellar sales growth, reigniting investor confidence that the luxury goods market is bouncing back from its post-Covid slump.\n\nOn top of that, Bernard Arnault's wealth is soaring like never before. The LVMH CEO has added $15 billion to his net worth, making him the biggest wealth gainer so far this year. His fortune now sits at $190 billion, climbing him into the fourth spot on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, knocking out Larry Ellison. With brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Tiffany under its umbrella, Arnault is positioned to continue this winning streak. Even with the luxury sector taking hits in the past year, LVMH's broad brand portfolio and its rebound this year have set it up for sustained growth.\n\nThe contrast couldn't be clearer when you look at Novo Nordisk. Shares dropped over 5% after the US government announced it would negotiate prices for the company's blockbuster drugs. After a disappointing trial for its next-gen obesity treatment, the Danish drugmaker's future is looking a little less bright. LVMH, on the other hand, is thriving, and its resurgence is signaling that luxury is backmaking Arnault's stake in LVMH a shining example of where investors should be looking in 2025.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

The event will now take place in two phases (20-21 and 30-31 January) and two locations \u2013 New York and Paris. While meetings with media and clients have been relocated, the new product launches will proceed as planned. WorldTempus will cover these releases from Tuesday and throughout the week.\n\nFor the first time, LVMH is showcasing all nine of its watchmaking brands at this event: Bulgari, Hublot, Daniel Roth, G\u00e9rald Genta, L\u2019Ep\u00e9e 1839, Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer, Tiffany & Co. and Zenith. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, President and CEO of LVMH\u2019s Watch Division, notes: \u201cThis event allows us to present our latest creations to customers and partners at the start of the year, with exciting surprises and exceptional timepieces to look forward to in 2025.\u201d\n\nWorldTempus plans to publish around 30 articles, including interviews with CEOs Antoine Pin (TAG Heuer), Benoit De Clerck (Zenith) and Julien Tornare (Hublot). For additional coverage, follow @gmtmagofficial and @worldtempus on social media. A special mention goes to Zenith, which celebrates its 160th anniversary this year.\n\nThe LVMH Watch Week concept was born in Dubai in 2020. The following two editions adapted to the pandemic with digital formats, followed by a hybrid version in 2023 combining in-person events in Singapore and New York with digital presentations for the rest of the world. Last year\u2019s event in Miami featured six brands. The tradition of LVMH presenting its watches early in the year dates back to 2017. Initially, the group exhibited at the now-defunct Baselworld, which took place each spring, and strategically positioned itself in Geneva during January\u2019s SIHH. This was partly to make the most of the visitors to the Geneva event, and partly to send a message to Basel that the start of the year was more advantageous for them.\n\nThe event, originally named LVMH Watch Days, brought together Hublot, TAG Heuer and Zenith on a CGN steamboat. It evolved into LVMH Geneva Days in 2018 and 2019, when Bulgari was welcomed into the fold. It was probably this decentralised exhibition concept that inspired Bulgari CEO Jean-Christophe Babin to initiate Geneva Watch Days in 2020, when Covid-19 forced the closure of both Baselworld and the SIHH, bringing together 15 brands of all sizes on the shores of Lake Geneva. The experiment was deemed a success, and since then has evolved and grown, with the number of exhibitors quadrupling over five years.\n\nLVMH Watch Week 2025 promises an exciting start to the year; our editorial team has selected watches of all colours, shapes and sizes to suit every budget.",

His former first lady wife took a different track altogether, wearing a brown dress. The Arnaults also dressed to stay above the fray, with the father and son turning up in slim dark suits with narrow dark ties.

The company also aims to target younger consumers and expand global partnerships, including collaborations with F1.\n\nAnalyst Eugenio Catone believes that LVMH is currently undervalued due to temporary market fluctuations.

You look at it, and a small text reading Louis Vuitton looks back at you. It\u2019s a company that is a behemoth in the fashion industry, acquiring many different companies all the time. But is it really a great company to invest in? Let's take a look at it!\n\nToday I will be collaborating with Kontra - so make sure to check out his substack!\n\nIf YOU also want to collaborate, just let me know - I\u2019m open :)\n\nStock Information\n\nThis compay is a fashion industry monster, doing serial aquisitions, which helped to propell their growth even more. They also own spirits brands, so beverage business is also included, and that\u2019s good, as it offers you a diversification safety net, and also, I like to buy companies which are like ETFs - with many segments, but only the good ones, unlike an ETF!\n\nMany LVMH leather goods, including wallets, are produced in workshops located in France, Italy, and Spain. They put a big emphasis on European craftsmanship, so that\u2019s a big win! While China can compete with them, remember that LVMH owns many brands, and such a state doesn\u2019t make them worried, not a little bit.\n\nLVMH trades under many different symbols, which is an absolute mess, and I had to make some big changes to my stock tool I programmed (Now I can get data from stock exchanges other than the US ones!), here\u2019s a market share chart (LVMH is BIT:1MC):\n\nNote: sometimes my charts aren\u2019t really accurate, as different companies may have the same ticker symbols, which in my opinion should be banned, but nevertheless, LVMH has a 40% market share compared to its luxury competitors, not bad!\n\nNext up, let\u2019s look at the efficiency of the company (how much cash invested yields good returns):\n\nVSO financial efficiency chart (also made using my tool):\n\nWe can see LVMH ROIC, ROA and ROE metrics ae above the median for its industry, I like that a lot! Pandora, 1SO and MONC also have very good metrics! Guess you have more stocks to search for.\n\nNow let\u2019s get into the profit margins, as we really want the company to have pricing power, and not just barely break even, like some companies:\n\nWe can see their massive 68% gross margin, indicating small costs, and big pricing power. Net profit margin is at 16%, so not too bad, but could be better.\n\nBut what even are profit margins? Click and zoom in or save:\n\nFinancial Health\n\nI can\u2019t highlight it more often. This is the most important part of every stock analysis, as if you buy a company whose debt significantly supresses its cash, then say goodbye to your hard-earned money. Don\u2019t get trapped into thinking that only by \u201cbuying the next Microsoft - but it\u2019s unprofitable\u201d, you\u2019re going to make more money - no, we investors focus on buying high quality, capital light, businesses with wide moats, with great future outlook.\n\nThe financial health cubes, which you are going to see in a moment are made out of 125 blocks, each cube being proportionally divided, and some hidden, so that it reflects the real proportions between the values, red mean negative values, and green positive, and have been made by my tool -which means, you won\u2019t see it anywehre else, and if you do, and it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s a copycat! :)\n\nWe can see that LVMH (BIT:1MC), has a minus net cash position, which isn\u2019t good. In fact, it\u2019s absolutely terrible! However, we can calm down, as they have a positive net equity (If you don\u2019t know what net equity is check out my article here on Microstrategy, I go over it in more detail:\n\nAntoni Nabzdyk\n\n\u00b7\n\nJan 13\n\nRead full story\n\n. Phew! Their Debt / EBITDA is at 1.49, which means they would be able to pay off all their debt using their EBITDA earnings in 1.5 years! That\u2019s not too bad! I know EBITDA can\u2019t be equal to earnings, but it just shows you a picture of their financial health.\n\nIf you have any ideas on how to show complicated stock metrics easily, let me know, and I\u2019ll try to create it! :]\n\nAlright, let\u2019s move on!\n\nRevenue growth\n\nTheir revenue has grown in the past by 40, 30, 20 and 15%, but right now it isn\u2019t - their net income is going down - that might be due to some consumers not buying their items, when it\u2019s a recession?\n\nI don\u2019t like it that their growth is slowing down, but what can I do? At least as a shareholder, you can visit a wine cellar of theirs! :)\n\nsimilar story here as well:\n\nAntoni Nabzdyk and DIY Investor\n\n\u00b7\n\nJan 10\n\nRead full story\n\nDividends & Buybacks\n\nA great company is the one which returns capital to its shareholders. Either through buybacks and/ or dividends, with buybacks being the most tax-efficient option, as the money won\u2019t get taxed that way, and we can see that LVMH is focusing on dividends, with a 2.2% yield, that is growing slowly at a rate of $%, with a healthy payout ratio under the 50% mark (46%).\n\nIt\u2019s payment frequency is Semi-Annual, with one dividend being larger than the other, and then smaller, and so on. In terms of their buybacks, they have been buying a little bit of their stock every quarter, albeit it\u2019s a small yield of 0.3%.\n\nValuation\n\nWe want to get the most value for our money. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t want to overpay for a company, as we want it to be undervalued or at least fair-valued at time of writing. Let\u2019s check LVMH\u2019s condition! :)\n\nMy valuation (using my tool) - I set the growth rate to be a conservative 4%, vbarely keeping up with inflation:\n\nSimply Wall.st:\n\nRemember that I always could\u2019ve made a mistake, and simplywall.st could also!\n\nConclusion\n\nWith a wide range of products, LVMH stands at an incredibly high quality proposition, with many opportunities for future growth. Declining revenues, however, showing less and less revenue growth is what worries me, at the same time, they have a huge market position. For the time being, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s a hold, unless I do more research.\n\nThis isn\u2019t financial advice.\n\nKontra\u2019s part:\n\nBackground\n\nLVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) continues to shine as the undisputed leader in the global luxury market. With 75 prestigious brands spanning fashion, leather goods, wines & spirits, perfumes & cosmetics, watches & jewelry, and selective retailing, the conglomerate embodies both diversification and luxury. The iconic Louis Vuitton brand remains at the heart of this empire, contributing over 50% of recurring EBIT and setting the standard in luxury worldwide.\n\nA Rich Portfolio and Strategic Acquisitions\n\nLVMH has mastered the art of blending heritage with modernity. Recent acquisitions, including Tiffany & Co. in 2021 and Christian Dior Couture in 2017, have fortified its position in the luxury market. Operating through a global network of over 6,000 stores, the group maintains a strong physical retail presence that complements its digital strategies. Luxury is not only the domain of the wealthy; LVMH\u2019s brands resonate globally as aspirational symbols for many. This broad appeal underscores the strength of its portfolio, which includes industry-defining names like Bulgari, Givenchy, and Christian Dior. The Arnault family continues to hold a majority share, ensuring the group\u2019s strategic vision remains intact.\n\nResilient Financial Performance: Q3 2024 Highlights Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, LVMH demonstrated resilience in its Q3 2024 results. Revenue trends reflect a mixed performance across divisions and geographies:\n\nKey Performance Highlights\n\n\u2022 Stable organic revenue over the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting adaptability amid volatile conditions. \u2022 Fashion & Leather Goods (F&LG), the group\u2019s largest segment, saw a slight decline in organic revenue (-1%) but maintained strong brand equity with robust demand for Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior products. \u2022 Perfumes & Cosmetics reported a 5% organic revenue growth, driven by strong momentum in fragrances and a continued focus on selective retail strategies. \u2022 Watches & Jewelry experienced a 3% dip in organic revenue, as the group doubled down on elevating its Maisons and driving innovation. \u2022 Selective Retailing, led by Sephora, showed impressive growth with a 6% increase in organic revenue, countering challenges faced by DFS due to international travel disruptions. \u2022 Wines & Spirits recorded an 8% decline in organic revenue, reflecting ongoing challenges in the U.S. market, albeit with signs of gradual recovery in cognac sales.\n\nGeographical Insights\n\nLVMH\u2019s balanced revenue mix remains a cornerstone of its resilience: \u2022 Japan exhibited strong momentum, though slightly moderated in Q3. \u2022 The U.S. market showed improvement in specific segments like cognac. \u2022 China\u2019s recovery was steady, bolstering overall Asia-Pacific performance.\n\nFinancial Overview",

The Meta and Tesla CEOs have added around $9 billion and $7 billion to their respective fortunes in just over two weeks, respectively.\n\nArnault's net worth soared on Thursday as LVMH stock surged 9% to close at its highest price since September. Arnault owns about 48% of the luxury conglomerate, which houses around 75 brands, including Tiffany & Co, Dom Perignon, and Sephora.\n\nThe shares jumped on hopes of a rebound in luxury demand after rival Richemont \u2014 the owner of brands like Cartier and Chlo\u00e9 \u2014 reported record quarterly sales with around 20% growth across Europe, the Americas, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa.\n\nConsumer appetite for pricey products came roaring back after the pandemic as people resumed traveling and shopping again. But the luxury business has struggled more recently as brisk inflation, higher interest rates, and economic fears have dampened demand even among well-heeled buyers.\n\nArnault, nicknamed the \"Wolf in Cashmere,\" was ranked as the world's richest person last March with a $230 billion-plus fortune, but his net worth shrank by over $50 billion by December as LVMH stock tumbled. Despite his latest gains, Arnault is still less than half as wealthy as Musk, worth $439 billion.\n\nEven accounting for Arnault's wealth decline, the world's 10 richest people added more than $500 billion to their combined fortunes in 2024, boosting their total worth to over $2 trillion.\n\nThe group benefited from the buzz around artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts, an improved US economic outlook, and hopes that Donald Trump's planned tax cuts and deregulation as president will boost corporate profits.",

The company, however, has denied any wrongdoing, stressing the challenges of overseeing distribution networks globally.\n\n\u201cSome distributors have export activities. It is therefore impossible for Mo\u00ebt Hennessy to control the final destination of a product marketed by a distributor,\u201d an LVMH spokesperson stated following questions about the report. The company emphasised that all its operations adhere to international laws and sanctions.\n\nThe luxury group ceased direct operations in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, joining other Western brands in pulling out of the region. However, parallel imports \u2014 a legal practice allowing goods to enter Russia without direct agreements with brands \u2014 continue to ensure a steady supply of Western luxury items for Russian consumers.\n\nWhile affluent Russians remain avid buyers of luxury goods, their share in the global luxury market is minimal compared to the US and China, LVMH\u2019s key growth markets.\n\nLooking ahead, LVMH\u2019s Wines & Spirits division, soon to be co-led by CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony and Alexandre Arnault, faces broader challenges, including weakened U.S. demand and ongoing trade tensions with China. Despite these hurdles, the brand maintains its stance on compliance and transparency in all markets.\n\nThe controversy highlights the difficulties luxury brands face in balancing ethical responsibilities with global distribution, as sanctions and geopolitical tensions reshape the industry landscape.\n\nRelated news\n\nHas Champagne become too expensive?\n\nTrump\u2019s 200% tariff threat leaves wine world reeling\n\nMaster Winemaker 100: Julien Lefevre",

I love Patagonia. But let other fishermen wear those.\u201d\n\nSatoshi Kuwata, founder of Milan-based label Setchu and winner of the 10th edition of the LVMH Prize. He is pictured with models at the LVMH Prize event in Paris, in June 2023. Photo: Handout\n\nKuwata, I soon find out, is full of surprises, on top of being an avid fisherman \u2013 something which as he explains later, has more in common with fashion than you may think. His voice rings with the intonation of Japanese, the language of his home country, but his accent is difficult to pin down \u2013 I first hear the dignified sounds familiar to Britain, where Kuwata spent years working on Savile Row, then the Italian flourishes with which he finishes his sentences. He\u2019s now based in Milan, where he launched Setchu back in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, I was a bit embarrassed about my English as well, but this is who I am,\u201d Kuwata admits. Though I only mention it in passing, the story surrounding his intriguing voice and how it came to be soon becomes a focal point of our conversation. \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m 41 now \u2013 when I won the LVMH [Prize], I was 40 \u2013 I started accepting and appreciating who I am finally.\u201d\n\nSatoshi Kuwata receiving the trophy for the 2023 LVMH Prize from Gal Gadot. Photo: Handout\n\nThe prize itself wasn\u2019t even the most affirmative part, Kuwata notes \u2013 it was also the first time the LVMH Prize jury had voted unanimously on a winner. \u201cHave you ever left your phone in the car in the summer?\u201d he asks, reflecting on the overnight success which followed. \u201cWhile I was giving [my] speech, I felt like my lap was really hot, and it was because I got a million messages on Instagram \u2013 and went [from] 7,000 followers to 20,000.\u201d\n\nIn addition to that pivotal moment, Kuwata \u2013 who was recently named guest designer for the 107th edition of Pitti Uomo, Florence\u2019s biannual menswear trade show \u2013 certainly has a lot to celebrate, entering this next decade of life. Beyond being honoured by the world\u2019s largest luxury conglomerate, thereby securing the prize money and mentorship of LVMH, he now counts some of the world\u2019s most respected designers as his trusted customers.\n\n\u201cDelphine [Arnault, CEO of LVMH] was really happy to see how much my company grew,\u201d he says. \u201cMaria Grazia Chiuri [Dior creative director], she\u2019s my client. And [Louis Vuitton\u2019s] Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re was like, \u2018I want to buy, too.\u2019\u201d\n\nSetchu spring/summer 2025. Photo: Handout\n\nSetchu, which as Kuwata puts it, roughly translates to \u201cthe bridge between Japan and the West\u201d, is a visual representation of the rich cultural backdrop which has shaped his expansive world view \u2013 and confusing accent \u2013 over the years. Some of the brand\u2019s styles recall the Japanese greats, borrowing from the functionality of Issey Miyake and the avant-garde aesthetics of Rei Kawakubo and Junya Watanabe, but the design language remains purposefully ambiguous \u2013 and wholly Setchu.",

It did note challenging demand in China, a key market for the luxury sector and one where LVMH has struggled.\n\nRichemont added that sales fell in the Asia-Pacific region but that the decline slowed at 7%. Sales in China were down 18%. Across its product segments, the growth was broad-based, with a 14% increase in jewelry.\n\nThe Cartier parent is the first major luxury company to report earnings this quarter, so it's unsurprising to see other luxury stocks rising on the news. Its report also reflects the key holiday season when luxury sales tend to jump.\n\nWhat it means for LVMH\n\nLike much of the luxury sector, LVMH has struggled recently, especially in China. Through the first three quarters of 2024, organic revenue has been flat due in part to an 8% decline in wines and spirits.\n\nLVMH isn't a perfect overlap with Richemont as LVMH is more diversified with alcohol, fashion, and Sephora. Still, the luxury sector does tend to move together, though Richemont focuses on the highest end of the market.\n\nOverall, the news bodes well for LVMH, as a turnaround in the sector seems overdue.",

            "content": "On Thursday afternoon luxury conglomerate Richemont revealed that it saw a 10% increase in sales during the three months ending at the New Year, a key period for luxury performance. The positive news is a potential sign that the luxury market might be picking up again following a rocky end to 2024, which put most luxury conglomerates on high alert.\n\nAlong with boosting Richemont\u2019s shares by 18%, the reports spread cheer across the luxury sector as top conglomerate LVMH gained as much as nearly 9% and Herm\u00e8s International increased by 6%.\n\nAccording to Business of Fashion, the US and European markets drove the boost with purchases focussed on fine jewelry, counterbalancing weaker than normal watch sales. Though sales continued to decline in Asia, most heavily in China, the results reportedly beat analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nRichemont is the parent to a variety of luxury names from Cartier in jewelry to Piaget in watches, and popular maisons ALA\u00cfA, Chloe, Montblanc and more. Business of Fashion pointed out that Richemont\u2019s stake in \u201chard luxury\u201d (jewelry and watches) benefitted the company\u2019s success through the otherwise difficult period for luxury. On the other hand, Kering and LVMH specialize in \u201csoft luxury\u201d (handbags and clothing), which tend to be more volatile than jewelry trends.\n\nHowever, time will tell, as LVMH is set to post its results from the same period on January 28. Stay tuned to Hypebeast for the latest updates on the luxury market and other top fashion news.",

In fact, he wasn\u2019t planning on showing at all, but when Pitti approached him last year, he felt the timing was right. \u201cI want to show people how much we have progressed,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I applied for the LVMH Prize, it was only me. Now, I have two assistants and a team of interns. The vibe is really good. There\u2019s no ego.\u201d\n\nPitti is a way to boost awareness following the prize win. \u201cWhen I won the LVMH Prize, [Setchu] only had 7,000 followers. Now, we have 35,000,\u201d he tells me. \u201cPitti is the biggest men\u2019s fashion event in the world. It\u2019s a great opportunity for us to show people what we do.\u201d\n\nKuwata himself has remained quiet so far, allowing Setchu to speak for itself. But now, as designers from Simon Porte Jacquemus to Jonathan Anderson enter the limelight, and customers increasingly want to know the person behind the clothes, he\u2019s reconsidering. \u201cMy advisor Fabrice Paineau [from the LVMH Prize] told me Setchu is too mysterious, and that consumers need to know me. So I am adding this element of who I am a little bit to this collection. I love fishing, right? So that\u2019s incorporated into the collection [with outerwear and outdoorsy materials].\u201d\n\nThe show will take place in Florence\u2019s National Library, and is divided into three parts: morning, evening and night (evident through the colour palettes and silhouettes). There will be a presentation element afterwards so that attendees can stay a while, talk to Kuwata and get up close to the clothes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do a fashion show that you can see in Paris, London or Milan,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point? Pitti is a place where people can take their time because you don\u2019t have to run to the next show.\u201d\n\nProtecting margins and responsible growth\n\nSetchu\u2019s price point is high, ranging from \u20ac250 for a T-shirt to \u20ac3,500 for a suede coat. Kuwata prefers to limit distribution slightly and sell fewer, high-ticket items. But as material costs rise, he\u2019s struggling to keep his prices where they are. \u201cThe price of cashmere yarn increases every two months at the moment. I\u2019ve been doing design for 20 years and I\u2019ve never seen it like this,\u201d he says. \u201cSome buyers complain, saying, \u2018Satoshi, we\u2019re not going to buy because it\u2019s too expensive.\u2019 And I have to say, \u2018Yes, I understand if you can\u2019t buy it, I\u2019m not going to force you because I cannot reduce the price.\u2019\u201d",

            "content": "Richemont sales unexpectedly jumped by double digits during the holiday shopping season as consumers splurged on Cartier jewellery, a tentative sign that demand for luxury goods may be recovering.\n\nSales soared 10 percent during the three months through December at constant exchange rates, Richemont said Thursday. Analysts had expected a gain of less than 1 percent. The Americas and Europe drove the performance, with purchases of expensive jewellery offsetting weak watch sales, which have weighed on the group\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cWe view these results as exceptionally strong,\u201d Piral Dadhania, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note.\n\nThe performance lifted shares of Richemont by as much as 18 percent in early trading and boosted other luxury groups on optimism the worst may be over for the industry, which has faced cooler demand for high-end goods after years of aggressive price increases. Though Richemont\u2019s greater exposure to jewellery gives it some insulation from the volatility of other fashion categories, rivals also rose on the news. LVMH gained as much as 8.6 percent in Paris, while Herm\u00e8s International climbed 6 percent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEven Richemont\u2019s performance in the Asia Pacific region, where sales slid by 7 percent in the past three months, was much better than estimates. Only China, where shoppers have shown less appetite for luxury amid worries about the health of the real estate market, remained a weak spot, with sales dropping 18 percent in the quarter.\n\nThe final three months of the year is typically the most important period for luxury labels because of holiday shopping.\n\nRichemont owns Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, two sought-after jewelry brands. This part of the market, known as hard luxury, often does better in times of uncertainty as jewelry tends to be more timeless than handbags and other fashion items. Richemont\u2019s watch segment also did better than estimates, with revenue falling less than expected.\n\n\u201cAlthough still fragile, the market is showing signs of stabilisation,\u201d in China, Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy wrote in a note. But overall, \u201cdespite the challenging situation in China and in watches, Richemont has never been stronger,\u201d he added.\n\nSome companies catering to the very wealthy have weathered the luxury downturn better than those appealing to the less well-off.\n\nEarlier this week, Brunello Cucinelli SpA posted strong quarterly revenue and forecast sales growth of 10 percent this year and next. The Italian brand sells cashmere and vicu\u00f1a bomber jackets for \u20ac17,500 ($17,992.)\n\nLVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, the world\u2019s biggest luxury group, will report earnings on Jan. 28. The French company, led by billionaire Bernard Arnault, is more exposed to the so-called \u201csoft luxury\u201d segment, which offers handbags and ready to wear fashions.\n\nBy Angelina Rascouet\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLearn more:\n\nRichemont\u2019s China Sales Fall 27%\n\nThe Swiss luxury group, whose brands include Cartier, Vacheron Constantin and Chlo\u00e9, reported six-month revenues down one percent.

Richemont's performance indicates a recovery in the luxury sector, propelling other related stocks upward.\n\nAs a leading entity in the luxury goods sector, LVMH (LVMUY, Financial) holds a significant market position with a market capitalization of $358.82 billion. The company exhibits financial strength with an Altman Z-Score of 3.74, indicating a strong fiscal standing. The Piotroski F-Score of 8 further reflects a healthy financial status, suggesting a robust operational framework.\n\nLVMH's price-to-earnings (PE) ratio stands at 23.75, aligning closely with its five-year low, making it potentially attractive to value investors. The Price-to-Book (PB) ratio is 5.4, near its three-year low, indicating that the stock might be undervalued compared to its book value. The company's dividend yield is approaching a five-year high, pointing to potential income opportunities for shareholders.\n\nAccording to the GF Value, LVMUY is deemed modestly undervalued. Investors might find potential growth in the stock given its robust fundamentals and market position in the luxury segment. For further insights, you can explore GF Value.\n\nDespite challenges in China resulting in flat organic revenue in the first three quarters of 2024, LVMH's diversification across sectors like fashion, alcohol, and retailing could provide resilience.

            "content": "(Jan 15): Europe\u2019s beaten-down luxury stocks have turned a corner the past two months, increasing the stakes for the earnings the companies are about to announce.\n\nSpeculation that China\u2019s economic stimulus will lead to higher spending, and that President-elect Donald Trump will manage to boost US growth, has lifted a Goldman Sachs Group Inc basket tracking the sector by 13% since mid-November, outpacing the broader market. Now investors need proof that the optimism was justified.\n\n\u201cWhat we really want to see is a sense of increased confidence,\u201d said Nick Clay, a fund manager at London investment firm Redwheel. Investors want signs \u201cthat suffering has bottomed in the fourth quarter of last year\u201d.\n\nThe first big test comes on Thursday, when Cartier owner Richemont reports sales for the December quarter. Sector bellwether LVMH announces results on Jan 28, with Gucci owner Kering SA scheduled for Feb 11 and Hermes International SCA on Feb 14. Burberry Group plc reports quarterly sales on Jan 24.\n\nThere have been some early positives. On Monday, fourth-quarter sales from Italy\u2019s Brunello Cucinelli SpA showed demand is holding up at the ultra-wealthy end of the spectrum, where customers can buy \u20ac17,500 (US$18,000 or RM81,160) cashmere and vicu\u00f1a bomber jackets.\n\nThe stakes are high for investors. France\u2019s LVMH is the region\u2019s second-biggest company by market value, while Hermes and Richemont also have big weightings in national and regional indices. That means a further rally in the sector could lift benchmarks across Europe after a year when many stocks got hammered by weak sales in China.\n\nThe sales and earnings reports due over the next few weeks are crucial because they reflect consumer demand over the Christmas shopping season.\n\nRichemont, the owner of Van Cleef & Arpels, should benefit from growth in jewellery, which offers a \u201ccompelling price to value proposition\u201d, according to TD Cowen analysts, who recently upgraded the stock to 'buy'.\n\nThe bull case for the stocks at this point is that executives may signal they are seeing early signs the market is in the process of bottoming. A dramatic improvement in fourth-quarter results is unlikely, given that the slump in China\u2019s property market shows no signs of abating, while the rising cost of goods and materials could put pressure on company margins.\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter should still be a bit difficult,\u201d Morningstar analyst Jelena Sokolova said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see yet the inflection point.\u201d\n\nJudging by analyst ratings, companies serving the wealthiest section of society tend to be more in favour, given they are seen as more insulated from swings in the global economy. LVMH has by far the greatest number of analyst buy ratings at 26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, followed by Richemont and Hermes.\n\nInvestors also will be keen to see how companies undergoing a revamp, such as Kering\u2019s Gucci, Burberry and Hugo Boss AG, are faring. Overall, any indications that the industry\u2019s recovery has legs will be most welcome.\n\nSigns of a revival in growth are especially important now because valuations of luxury companies have ticked into slightly expensive territory. The buzz around some brands, such as Hermes and Prada SpA\u2019s Miu Miu, may justify the higher price-earnings ratios.\n\n\u201cThose luxury companies with very strong brands \u2014 they are where the demand is,\u201d said Helen Jewell, the chief investment officer of fundamental equities EMEA at BlackRock Inc. \u201cWhere the brand strength is real, those companies have done incredibly well. It cannot be replicated. They have pricing power.\u201d",

            "content": "\n\nEven as you savor the present, it\u2019s worth remembering the journey that brought you here. This was the first thought that crossed my mind upon seeing Dom P\u00e9rignon\u2019s latest incarnation. The LVMH-owned Champagne house teamed up with Stockholm-based artist Mathias Bengtsson to create a limited edition collection of Champagne bottles, each encased in intricate, vine-like sculptures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis collaboration has produced two unique limited editions. Sixty of these gilded masterpieces, each numbered, hold the Dom P\u00e9rignon Vintage 1999 Pl\u00e9nitude 2. An even rarer pink-gold version, just 20 in total, houses the Dom P\u00e9rignon Vintage 2000 Pl\u00e9nitude 2 Ros\u00e9. For once, it\u2019s not the Champagne itself that captures my attention, it\u2019s the cases, breathtaking sculptures that elevate the entire experience.\n\n\n\nBengtsson, a visionary Danish designer, turned to biomimicry, using digital \u2018seeds\u2019 imbued with DNA-like algorithms to mimic how vines twist and flourish through ever-changing weather conditions. The resulting sculptures were cast in bronze, plated to achieve their lustrous finishes, and hand-polished to perfection. Each singular creation is designed to embrace the magnum bottles of these exceptional vintages.\n\n\n\nAs for the Champagne within, Dom P\u00e9rignon Vintage 1999 Pl\u00e9nitude 2 delivers an intricate umami profile, its mid-palate unexpectedly lush and fruity. The finish lingers with hints of sea breeze and delicately toasted notes. In contrast, Dom P\u00e9rignon Vintage 2000 Pl\u00e9nitude 2 Ros\u00e9 captures both warmth and coolness in every sip. Its soft, rounded mouthfeel gives way to a surprising finale, tightening, then relaxing, layered with sappy acidity that intrigues and delights.",

            "content": "You may not be able to define luxury, but chances are good that you know it when you see it. Luxury goods are the opposite of necessities. They're high-end products that consumers want but don't need. They're also distinct from commodity products (such as bananas or gasoline) that are not easily distinguished by brand. Luxury goods are more expensive than competing products because they are perceived as higher quality and confer status on the owner. Because of that relationship, the brand is a crucial component of a luxury stock. The best luxury stocks include strong brands, high operating margins, and timeless products.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Louis Vuitton Malletier / Alessandro Garofalo\n\nAs non-necessities, luxury goods resemble high-priced discretionary goods, making them the opposite of consumer staples, or everyday products, such as groceries, that consumers buy because they need them. Although luxury goods may sometimes be durable goods, such as cars, they can also be consumables -- cosmetics or cigars, for example. Investors most often think of retail products when they think of luxury. Those may include fashion from brands such as Burberry Group (BURBY -4.28%); Jimmy Choo, which is owned by Capri Holdings (CPRI 1.09%); or Stuart Weitzman, which belongs to Tapestry (TPR -0.41%). However, the sector goes beyond retail to include travel, food and dining, and even services.\n\nBest luxury stocks to buy Best luxury stocks to buy The chart below shows three of the top luxury stocks you can buy this year.\n\nTop luxury stocks Stock Ticker Description RH (NYSE:RH) A retailer of upscale furniture and home goods. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (OTC:LVMHF) World\u2019s largest luxury company spanning multiple brands and product lines. Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) Maker of luxury sports cars.\n\nThe three stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 (INDEX:^GSPC) over their histories and have benefited from a bull market, an expanding global economy, and increasing wealth among upper-class consumers who profited in the pandemic stock market boom. Because these companies count on wealthy customers, their performance is highly correlated with macroeconomic indicators such as the stock market or real estate prices.\n\n1. RH 1. RH (Restoration Hardware)\n\nRH, the company formerly known as Restoration Hardware, has mastered the market for expensive home goods. The company sells items that include $5,000 dining tables and $8,000 leather couches based on a modern and contemporary design motif. RH uses mailed source books and thick catalogs to stimulate demand, and it sells its wares from a handful of splashy galleries across North America and Europe. Under the leadership of CEO Gary Friedman, the company successfully pivoted to a membership model, selling annual memberships at $100 in exchange for 25% discounts on merchandise. The policy has encouraged repeat purchases and customer loyalty. Its next step is transitioning to a lifestyle brand as the company plans to open up hotels, restaurants, and private jets and launch a streaming service based around architecture and design. Business has been sluggish in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic as interest rates jumped and the housing market slowed down; home sales are a key driver of spending on home furnishings. Nonetheless, the company should return to steady growth as the housing market normalizes, and the stock looks cheap if it can return to its earlier level of profitability.\n\n2. LVMH 2. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton\n\nLVMH is the world's biggest luxury company, valued at roughly $330 billion. The company has diversified holdings in wine and spirits, luxury fashion and leather goods, perfumes and cosmetics, and jewelry and watches, among other businesses. It's been a prolific acquirer of luxury brands, adding Officine Universelle Buly, a French perfume and cosmetics company, in October 2021 and Tiffany in January 2021. In recent years, much of the company's growth has come from mainland China, where an emerging upper class and a culture of conspicuous consumption have supported growth across much of the luxury market. In a difficult macroeconomic environment, LVMH reported organic revenue, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and currency exchange up 13% to 86.2 billion euros. Profits were strong as well, with operating income up 8% to 22.8 billion euros and an operating margin of 26.5%. LVMH's size gives it competitive advantages through economies of scale and distribution, and its history of acquisitions also sets it up for long-term growth.\n\n3. Ferrari 3. Ferrari\n\nFerrari, the high-end sports car maker, employs a classic luxury selling technique. The company limits its production to support high prices and wide operating margins. Artificial scarcity, as this strategy is known, helps create demand for a product as it becomes an exclusive status symbol. Since not everyone can have one, people naturally want it more. Ferrari's management has argued that the company should be valued more like a luxury company than an automaker, and it earns a higher multiple than its auto sector peers. Like LVMH, the company has found a ripe market in China, and it's burnished its profits by selling limited-edition cars at prices topping $1 million. Performance remained strong through 2024, with revenue expected to increase 9% to 6.55 billion euros, and it was targeting a 27.5% operating margin.\n\nFinding the best stocks How to find the best luxury brand stocks Luxury companies are distinct from most companies in several ways, especially in the relationship between desirability and price, so there are some important differences to be aware of. Because rapid growth can dilute a brand -- especially if that growth comes from a mid-market customer base -- high revenue growth is rare for a luxury company. It is not the most important factor for investors. Instead, investors should consider the strength of its brands, which can often be measured by a company's pricing power or how expensive its items are compared to competitors' prices. Operating margin is the most important metric because it shows how successful the business is at converting revenue into profit. Investors should expect luxury companies to generate high operating margins; 20% or more is ideal here. While investors tend to think of companies such as LVMH, Hermes (HESAY 2.52%), or Gucci owner Kering (PPRUY -3.98%) as core luxury brands, luxury status extends beyond fashion and retail, and some companies have elements of a luxury business inside a larger one. Nike's (NKE -1.54%) Jordan brand, for instance, uses artificial scarcity to drive sales of its basketball sneakers, which often fetch top dollar on the resale market. Starbucks (SBUX 1.28%) has followed a similar playbook with its reserve roasteries and premium coffees, and Airbnb (ABNB 2.37%) offers luxury home rentals through Airbnb Luxe. Apple (AAPL 1.34%) and Tesla (TSLA 3.59%) serve as additional examples of companies that have successfully straddled the luxury and mass markets.\n\nLuxury ETFs Are there any luxury ETFs? For investors looking for an easy way to get exposure to a broad range of luxury stocks, the best way is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). The one that tracks the S&P Global Luxury Index is the Amundi S&P Global Luxury ETF (GLUX.MI), which trades on a number of European exchanges. The top 10 holdings in the S&P Index and the Amundi ETF are Hermes, Richemont (CFRUY 2.67%), Ferrari, LVMH, Tesla, LVMH, Royal Caribbean, Mercedes Benz, Marriott, Hilton, and Diageo (DEO -0.28%). As you can see, the list comprises a range of consumer products, including fashion, cosmetics, alcohol travel, and autos. The luxury sector has been a strong performer over the past decade, but it is susceptible to market pullbacks and recessions. Consumer spending on luxury products tends to fall in difficult times as wealth is lost.\n\nRelated investing topics\n\nShould I invest? Should I invest in publicly traded luxury companies? Many of the world's most powerful brands are luxury companies, and such brand power brings significant competitive advantages and big profit margins. Luxury stocks have a place in almost any portfolio. Luxury stocks also have a history of outperforming the broader market. Since the sector comprises companies that have proven themselves, they are relatively low-risk investments. Although cyclical, several trends favor luxury stocks over the longer term. These include the emergence of the luxury goods market in China and an expanding wealth class in the U.S. and Europe, which has increased the market for luxury goods. The drivers of luxury demand, such as the desirability of exclusivity and status, are also timeless, meaning this sector should continue to beat the market over the long term.",

            "content": "Louis Vuitton has been making some truly mind-bending watches for over a decade, pushing the limits of craft and complication in order to shake their reputation as a mere \u2018fashion watch\u2019 brand.\n\nBuilding on these efforts, it was last year when the reimagined Louis Vuitton Tambour launched that the broader watch-collecting community started to pay serious attention and in 2025, the French-founded fashion house has released some of its best watches to date at LVMH Watch Week 2025.\n\nAt the heart of Louis Vuitton\u2019s watchmaking is the La Fabrique du Temps workshop, which the brand acquired back in 2011. While Louis Vuitton has produced its complicated timepieces here for many years, the brand announced last year that it would also become the home of Gerald Genta and Daniel Roth \u2014brands LVMH acquired during its purchase of Bulgari, also in 2011.\n\nRELATED: A Week With The Bvlgari Octo Finissimo In \u2018Tuscan Copper\u2019\n\nToday, the La Fabrique du Temps workshop creates timepieces for all three brands and this week \u2014 on the occasion of LVMH Watch Week 2025 \u2014 we finally get to see what they\u2019ve been working on.\n\nWith two standout collections from Louis Vuitton and a watch apiece from Gerald Genta and Daniel Roth, there\u2019s plenty to sink your teeth into.\n\nLouis Vuitton Tambour Convergence\n\nArriving in two different variations, the Louis Vuitton Tambour Convergence is one for the vintage watch collectors of the world.\n\nFeaturing a time display at 12 o\u2019clock that communicates hours and minutes using two rotating discs, the \u201cdigital\u201d display nods to similar timepieces produced by many watchmakers in the early part of the 20th century.\n\nFeaturing a 37mm case that measures a remarkably slender 8mm front to back, it\u2019s available in either solid rose gold or diamond-set platinum. Both cases feature carefully considered details such as polished top surfaces and satin-brushed flanks, while the outer surface of the lugs are scalloped with the concave section finished with a sandblasted technique.\n\nVisible through the exhibition caseback is the La Fabrique du Temps in-house automatic Caliber LFT MA01.01, which comprises 201 components, and is wound by a pink gold oscillating weight that delivers 45 hours of power reserve when fully wound.\n\nBoth watches arrive on high-quality calf leather straps (this is Louis Vuitton we\u2019re talking about, after all) which are secured with pin buckles made from matching precious metals.\n\nLouis Vuitton Tambour Taiko Spin Time\n\nThe Tambour Spin Time has long been a shining example of the complexity Louis Vuitton\u2019s watchmakers are capable of and this year the collection arrives with another six new references.\n\nDubbed the Taiko Spin Time collection, the hours on these watches are displayed via 12 rotating cubes around the dial and the minutes by a centrally mounted hand.\n\nOf the six references, there\u2019s a time-only example (also available with diamonds); a transparent time-only model (also available with diamonds); a world timer; and a flying tourbillon. The standard time-only references (if you can use that word for such complex mechanisms) feature 39.5mm cases that measure 12.15mm thick, while the other four references have the same slightly larger case that measures 42.5mm in diameter and 12.45mm in thickness. All are cased in solid white gold.\n\nSimply put, they are all mechanical works of art, variously featuring perfectly set baguette-cut diamonds, hawk eye hard stone dial centres, and the kind of time display you can show to anybody wondering why mechanical watchmaking is \u201cstill a thing\u201d in 2025.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept we\u2019ve seen from Louis Vuitton before \u2014 in finer form than ever at LVMH Watch Week 2025.\n\nDaniel Roth Extra Plat Souscription\n\nAs a watchmaker, Daniel Roth was only relaunched in 2023 with the return of the Tourbillon Souscription in yellow gold, followed by another version in rose gold last year.\n\nIn 2025, the offering is a little more straightforward with the debut of the Daniel Roth Extra Plat Souscription: paying tribute to the original version from the 1990s, when Roth was still at the helm of his eponymous brand.\n\nAs you might have guessed, its name references the ultra-thin dress watches that Roth himself adored so much, with the case of this example measuring 35.5mm wide, 38.6mm long, and 7.7mm thick.\n\nBeyond the compact proportions of the case, the dial is undeniably eye-catching, crafted from the same yellow gold as the case, engraved with an engine-turned Clou de Paris pattern, and paired nicely with traditionally styled heat-blued arrow hands.\n\nPowered by the ultra-thin manually wound Caliber DR002 (just 3.1mm thick), it offers an impressive 70 hours of power reserve. The Daniel Roth Extra Plat Souscription arrives as a limited edition of 20 pieces.\n\nGerald Genta Oursin Fire Opal\n\nThe final watch to leave La Fabrique du Temps for LVMH Watch Week 2025 is the Gerald Genta Oursin Fire Opal \u2014 originally the fourth piece in the Gentissima Oursin collection that made its debut in 1994.\n\nAn extravagant example of Genta\u2019s creativity and boldness in design (the same man who created the Patek Philippe Nautilus and Audemars Piguet Royal Oak), it features a 36.5mm yellow gold 3N case with a total of 137 fire opal gems individually screwed into it.\n\nThe dial is crafted from an orange cornelian, punctuated by yellow gold 3N hour markers and hands, which combine for an unmissable presence on the wrist.\n\nPowered by the GG-005 Zenith Elite calibre, it delivers 50 hours of power reserve and will go on sale in May 2025.",

            "content": "But isn\u2019t it that Bernard Arnault is behind the disappearing Herm\u00e8s shares? This is one of three hypotheses advanced by Swiss company Tamedia, which, among other newspapers, controls Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve. Tamedia, as well as Glitz.paris and others, have gone on the hunt for the shares that Nicolas Puech, descendant of Thierry Herm\u00e8s and the maison\u2019s largest individual shareholder with 5.76% of the shares, claims to no longer own. Where did they end up? It is a mystery.\n\nHerm\u00e8s missing shares\n\nNicolas Puech, heir to the Herm\u00e8s fortune and long considered one of the richest men in Europe, will be 82 years old on 29 January 2025. He has no children. Last year he not only said he was broke. But he claimed he no longer owned Herm\u00e8s shares, and did not know where they had gone. He filed a complaint in Geneva against his former wealth manager, Swiss businessman Eric Freymond, accusing him of embezzlement (but without explaining how he did it, reveals Tamedia\u2019s investigation). So much so that his complaint was dismissed. According to Puech \u201cit is the theft of the century\u201d. At stake are more than 6 million shares, worth around EUR 13.8 billion. They are \u201cbearer\u201d shares, so not even the maison is able to establish who owns them.\n\nTamedia\u2019s reconstruction\n\nTamedia claims to have carefully examined \u201chundreds of pages of legal and financial documents\u201d. It did not find a solution, but developed three hypotheses. The first is that the shares ended up in the hands of Bernard Arnault, who attempted to acquire the historic maison in 2010. Through \u201cunderhand deals\u201d, they say, the LVMH patron would have taken possession of the shares, acquiring them without Puech\u2019s knowledge, since he did not manage his assets personally. A rather simple theory, writes Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve, but \u201cseveral elements contradict it\u201d.\n\nThe other hypotheses\n\nThe second hypothesis, summarises Fashion Network, is that Puech would have sought to shield the shares from any external \u201cattacks\u201d (family members and LVMH). And he would therefore have transferred his shares to a trust in the Bahamas in 2013. There are documents proving the trip Puech made, but not the eventual financial transaction. The third hypothesis is that of \u201cforgetfulness\u201d. That is, Puech would have hidden his Herm\u00e8s shares so well that he no longer remembers how and, above all, where. The enigma of Puech\u2019s shares has been the subject of numerous journalistic enquiries, but has not yet been solved. \u201cNicolas Puech\u2019s lawyers have contacted banks, lawyers and asset managers\u201d, including Phidias Gestion, and \u201cwe should know more in the coming months\u201d, write Tamedia.\n\nPhoto from Herm\u00e8s\n\nRead also:",

            "content": "This story is taken from Esquire's About Time newsletter, style director Johnny Davis\u2019s straight-talking take on the wonderful world of watches. Sign up here\n\nIn October, widespread rumours that the sponsorship of Formula 1 motorsport was to be passed from Rolex to the LVMH group, owners of 75 luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Mo\u00ebt Hennessy and Dior, as well as Tag Heuer watches, were confirmed.\n\nIt was naturally assumed that the watchmaker would take over the timekeeping of F1\u2019s 2025 season, not least because it had held that role before, from 1992 and 2003, as well as being the watch brand with by far the deepest roots in the competition.\n\nThose roots date back to the 1950s, when CEO Jack Heuer would sell stopwatches around the racetracks of America. He later named whole watch families for the sport, including the Monaco, the Carrera and, least ambiguously of all, the Formula 1. During motorsport\u2019s golden era, Niki Lauda, Ayrton Senna, Mario Andretti, Alain Prost, James Hunt and more were all kitted out with Heuer wristwear.\n\n(What\u2019s more, you didn\u2019t need to be Inspector Hunkeler to deduce that something might be going on last year, as Tag Heuer\u2019s release schedule skewed even more F1-friendly than normal. From the limited-edition re-editions of its poppy 1980s Formula 1 watch it launched with streetwear brand Kith in May to the high-end titanium Carrera in tribute to Ayrton Senna it put out in November.)\n\nDue to something contractual \u2013 presumably, Rolex\u2019s deal was technically still in place until the end of 2024 \u2013 Tag Heuer was disallowed from communicating the news until this week.\n\nOn Monday, ten minutes after it dropped a genuinely spectacular promo video to announce its return to F1, I spoke with the brand\u2019s chief marketing officer, George Ciz, and heritage director, Nicholas Biebuyck, over the internet from Tag Heuer HQ in Biel.\n\nThe stories surrounding the money for the deal being bandied about suggest that Rolex initially sponsored the F1 for $10m annually, a figure that rose to $50m, and included trackside branding at all the races as well as title sponsorship at select events.\n\nThe new LVMH deal is said to be worth $1bn, over ten years.\n\nThose figures are speculative, as well as big, but it\u2019s also been suggested they may even represent a bargain for LVMH.\n\nBecause this isn\u2019t about Rolex vs Tag Heuer.\n\n\u201cThe deal includes other LVMH brands and features the Mo\u00ebt champagne on the podium and the trophies in Louis Vuitton trunks,\u201d says Oliver R M\u00fcller, founder of the Swiss watch industry consultancy LuxeConsult. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a matter of outbidding Rolex, but rather a decision taken by Rolex to leave the sport, and then [F1 owners] Liberty Media took the opportunity to raise the stakes by more or less doubling the price.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the size of LVMH in total, it absolutely dwarfs Rolex,\u201d says the industry expert Andrew Morgan. \u201cAnd the drivers are getting more and more obsessed with fashion. In the old days, they would be knocking around the grid, and photographers could get pictures of them. Now what happens is, they all arrive in the morning, do a \u2018fashion parade\u2019, an idea started off by Lewis [Hamilton], then they disappear into the pits and you don\u2019t see them again.\n\n\"There\u2019s also the wives and girlfriends of the drivers, which luxury brands involved in F1 have been perusing. [Non-LVMH makeup brand] Charlotte Tilbury sponsors [all-female racing series] the F1 Academy, and has held birthday bashes for Kelly Piquet, daughter of [three-time F1 world champion] Nelson Piquet, and partner of [current world champion] Max Verstappen. Add on top an audience for that sport that\u2019s increasingly skewing female, and the deal starts to sound very good indeed.\u201d\n\nAnd so George Ciz, Nicholas Biebuyck and I mostly had a conversation where they deftly avoided questions about a deal they couldn\u2019t discuss, as well as a year\u2019s worth of watches they\u2019ve yet to announce.\n\nBut their enthusiasm was, justifiably, infectious.\n\nAfter we spoke, I asked Jeff Stein, Tag Heuer\u2019s foremost out-of-house historian, fan and the keeper of the peerless online resource OnTheDash, to put the brand\u2019s long association with motorsport into context.\n\nBelow is what Jeff said, followed by my chat with George and Nick.\n\nTAG Heuer Jack Heuer (centre), former Tag Heuer CEO and current honorary chairman. In 1971, he struck a landmark deal with Ferrari, making Heuer the official timekeeper for its Formula 1 team\n\nAbout Time: How did Jack Heuer go from peddling stopwatches at US racetracks, to selling wristwatches to the drivers?\n\nJeff Stein: Jack Heuer tells the story that his father, Charles-Edouard Heuer, sent him to the United States at age 26, in 1959, to address the company\u2019s problem in the stopwatch market. Heuer had a market share of 20 to 25 per cent in most major markets, but in the United States \u2013 by far the largest market in the world \u2013 it had only a two to three per cent. Jack was enthusiastic about all types of racing and rallying and immersed himself in all styles in the United States, from the amateur events on weekends to the top professional events, such as the 12 Hours of Sebring. He was peddling stopwatches to the race organisers and clubs, as well as the drivers and their teams.\n\nJack was always the master salesman and \u2013 perhaps even more importantly \u2013 he sensed natural selling and promotional opportunities. I have always imagined the racers and their team members visiting Jack\u2019s stand for the sake of buying the stopwatch \u2013 generally priced in the $25 to $35 range, and walking away with a beautiful new chronograph, priced in the $60 to $120 range. Jack was always a man of style, and selling chronographs must have come naturally to him.\n\nThe next step was Jack Heuer seeing this opportunity to sell wristwear to racers, and racing enthusiasts, and designing watches that they would find attractive and useful. It didn\u2019t take long for Jack to seize this opportunity, creating the Autavia in 1962 and the Carrera in 1963, and the uptake was incredible.\n\nGetty Images Jo Siffert at the Spanish Grand Prix, 19 April, 1970\n\nIn the glory days of F1 Lauder, Senna, Prost, Hunt, etc all looked incredible\u2026 Andretti beaming away, wearing his 18ct gold Heuer in a tiny cockpit, for example. The joke is that the last place you\u2019re going to need to check the time is doing 200mph whizzing around a racetrack, so these watches really were style statements more than anything else, right?\n\nAbsolutely correct. Steve McQueen famously selected his \u2018costume\u2019 for the filming of [1971 motor racing movie] Le Mans, wanting to look like a racer \u2013 specifically, Jo Siffert \u2013 and, circa 1970, the racers\u2019 costumes were comprised of racing suits, helmets, balaclavas and boots, and the prevalence of watches in the pits was also notable. Each of these items had elements of utility \u2013 fire protection, comfort, feel, etc \u2013 as well as style. The prevalence of chronographs on the wrists of racers was high. It was part of the racers\u2019 look. We see racers sitting on the \u201cArmco\u201d [steel safety barriers] looking at each other\u2019s watches and occasionally swapping them.\n\nTAG Heuer 1860 stopwatch\n\nIs it possible to quantify what the exposure from these drivers did for Heuer sales?\n\nI believe that the \u201cwin on Sunday, sell on Monday\u201d mantra motivated the watch brands, as well as the car brands. Heuer was everywhere in the world of racing and rallying, with racers and team members wearing Heuer chronographs, the racing teams using Heuer stopwatches and timers, organizers using Heuer gear to time the events and related brands \u2013 Champion, Motor Age, Shelby, and so on \u2013 used them as promotional items. Talk to racers from the 1960s and 1970s, and they will tell you that these were the watches that \u201ceveryone\u201d wanted.\n\nTAG Heuer Heuer Autavia chronograph, 1969\n\nThere\u2019s no end of cool/ oddball F1 related watches in the Tag Heuer archives \u2013 a 1974 range that honoured the great racetracks, eg: the Silverstone; or 1976\u2019s Monza to mark Ferrari\u2019s return to world champions. What would you like to see released this year?\n\nIt was nothing short of miraculous that the name \u201cFormula 1\u201d was available for Heuer to use in 1986. It\u2019s the perfect name for chronographs linked to motorsports. There\u2019s no doubt Tag Heuer will go \u201call-in\u201d on the Formula 1 collection this year. The demographics of the Formula 1 [sport] audience suggest that they can take the collection upmarket, adding more sophisticated materials and movements in the F1 chronographs. Walk through the paddock at an F1 weekend, and you\u2019ll see some amazing watches. The origins of the collection in 1986 and its position as the brand\u2019s \u201centry-level\u201d collection since then suggest that the F1 can have broad appeal as a simple, cool three-hand watch. The Kith collaboration validated that suggestion. Now, I imagine we\u2019ll see popular, well-priced watches with \u201cTag Heuer\u201d on the dial, rather than \u201cKith Heuer\u201d.\n\nPersonally, I am looking forward to seeing, and likely collecting, both ends of this range \u2013 the well-developed chronograph that moves \u201cup-market\u201d and the three-hand watch that the Gen Z enthusiasts will chase.\n\nAt heart, I\u2019m a Gen Zer.\n\nTAG Heuer And they\u2019re off. Again!\n\nAbout Time: Hello George, hello Nick. Congratulations on the announcement. The comments on your social media have been quite something. People are excited.\n\nGeorge Ciz: It\u2019s amazing. Honestly, there\u2019s only positive comments. People love things when they\u2019re authentic. When you double-down on the heritage. There\u2019s the beautiful video we just posted. I get goosebumps watching it. It\u2019s a really special moment for us. It\u2019s emotional.\n\nNicholas Biebuyck: It\u2019s super, super satisfying to finally be back. There\u2019s just unlimited stuff for us to talk about in this universe.\n\nTAG Heuer The new slogan\n\nI\u2019m enjoying the messaging. \"Official Timekeeper Of Formula 1. Again.\"\n\nGeorge Ciz: It\u2019s just a simple message! I don\u2019t think we need to say much more than that. It will progressively build-up through the year as product [ie: watches] get added. It\u2019s going to be very entertaining. It\u2019s going to be educational. We don\u2019t do a million different partnerships, you know? We\u2019ve really been slimming down our portfolio for the last four years. I think that makes us different from other brands. We don\u2019t just put the logos on the track. It\u2019s really the storytelling that\u2019s behind it.\n\nYou\u2019ve both been F1 fans for a long time. Why has it become so ridiculously popular now? It can\u2019t just be Drive to Survive, surely? The stats are huge \u2013 90m followers on social media; 1 in 3 are under 35; 42 per cent female\u2026\n\nGeorge Ciz: I can talk a little bit about that, because I\u2019ve spent most of my career in professional sport [prior to Tag Heuer, he played professional tennis]. You\u2019re absolutely right. I have never seen a sport that\u2019s grown like this one has, since Liberty Media took over. I think there have been a few things. [On one level] sport is the simplest business model on the planet. It\u2019s simply caring who wins or loses! [But Liberty has used] groundbreaking storytelling, over a sustained period. They talk about the teams. They talk about the story of the season \u2013 within the drivers\u2019 championships, the battles for all the places, in a way that the audience can understand. It\u2019s not only about \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201csecond\u201d. Now people really understand why it\u2019s important to finish fifth versus six. The way they improved the broadcasting, the coverage, even the audio you hear, so that you feel like you\u2019re at the track. You don\u2019t just market sport with glossy campaigns. You make the product good. That\u2019s brought in a lot of demographics, especially females. There\u2019s also been this fantastic competitive era \u2013 this rivalry coming through with Lewis Hamilton [at Ferrari] and Max Verstappen [at Oracle Red Bull Racing]. Then there\u2019s a great TV product that lasts two-plus hours. Appointment TV, every weekend. And then you add in all the work they\u2019ve done on the visual presentation on the merchandise. The rebranding. Great marketing is never just one lever that you pull. It\u2019s like a [graphic] equalizer, constantly pushing up all the different aspects.\n\nTAG Heuer The Heuer Microsplit stopwatch. The pocketed-sized LCD stopwatch was accurate to 1/100th of a second, created by German industrial designer Richard Sapper in 1976\n\nWhat about the partnerships?\n\nGeorge Ciz: They\u2019ve changed the way they do them. They have a limited number, globally, of which LVMH is now one. They\u2019re smart guys, the way they\u2019ve gone about it. Another important factor is they\u2019ve brought in the key opinion leaders. If you look at the paddocks, the number celebrities of there \u2013 it\u2019s incredible. I was in Abu Dhabi at the last race of the season [in December] \u2013 it was crazy [an eclectic guestlist included Brad Pitt, Tim Cook, Eminem, Eve Longoria, Evander Holyfield, Ken Watanabe and Muse]. And it\u2019s every race. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s once or twice a year. They\u2019ve also elevated everything \u2013 from the price position of the tickets, upwards. They\u2019ve created true desirability. Which is exactly what we try to do in the world of luxury.\n\nHow long has your deal been in the works for?\n\nGeorge Ciz: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place to comment on it. It\u2019s been a deal done on the group level. We\u2019re just super-happy that it happened. It\u2019s a mutually beneficial partnership.\n\nTAG Heuer The ref. S25.706C \"Senna\", from the early 1990s. The digital quartz chronograph had a unique dial with a 1/100 scale and a hand added to the central pinion. The watch was worn by Ayrton Senna and sold at auction in 2007 for $69,000. It is now part of Tag Heuer\u2019s archives\n\nTag Heuer stopped its partnership as the official timekeeper of Formula 1 in 2015, apparently for a mix of financial reasons, and wanting to diversify its sporting sponsorships. What happened there?\n\nGeorge Ciz: You know, we never really left. Even after we finished our timekeeping stint with F1. We were always there, with [sponsorship of] the teams \u2013 with McLaren, with Oracle Red Bull Racing now. If you look at the number of activations we have done in the last four years, I will say, minimum, 50 per cent of our work has been around racing and F1 and motorsports. This was a clear strategy. We wanted to refocus the brand on motorsports. The fact that this opportunity came up, it was the cherry on the top. Even before that, with our partnerships with Porsche, with Oracle Red Bull Racing \u2013 we have been in the sport because we are the brand for motorsport lovers.\n\nTAG Heuer Introduced in 1968, the Camaro chronograph has a unique position in the vintage Heuer catalogue. While the Autavia, introduced in 1962, and the Carrera, from 1963, went from manual-wind to automatic movements, the Camaro remained stubbornly manual-only\n\nWhat activations can we look forward to in 2025?\n\nGeorge Ciz: It\u2019s impossible to activate all 24 [races] in a huge way. We\u2019ll obviously pick certain races to do really huge things. But you will see some new things on the track [at all the events]. There will be amazing clocks around the races. We look forward to unveiling all of that in Melbourne, at the very first race of the season [on 24 March]. Clearly, Monaco will continue to be the spiritual home of this brand. There are many others between Miami, Las Vagas, Abu Dhabi. The other thing that Liberty Media has done really well is that the races are competing with each other, trying to outdo one another. It\u2019s this competition that drives the sport forward.\n\nNicholas Biebuyck: There\u2019s no debate that from a watchmaking perspective we are the one company that can truly talk about these things without anyone questioning our legitimacy in the space. Not only in Formula 1, but the automotive universe as a whole. The fact that the [1960s and 1970s drivers] were choosing to wear [Heuer] watches on their own and giving them out to their buddies and that we have so many amazing, iconic images of the greatest drivers in Formula 1 history, wearing our watches \u2013 it\u2019s just magical. Four years ago, when I joined the company, this was the dream that we will be back as official timekeepers. Clearly, I wasn\u2019t the only one who had this idea. So, you know, we\u2019re home.\n\nTAG Heuer The Heuer Easy Rider from 1971, developed with Ferrari driver Jacky Ickx\n\nThe communication so far has been based around a fair amount of archive footage. How are you going to join the past with the present?\n\nGeorge Ciz: Our communication is not based on one visual and one video. It\u2019s a year-long story. Not even a one-year story \u2013 a 10-year-long story. And hopefully much more than that. At the moment we\u2019re celebrating the fact we\u2019re back, and we\u2019re talking about our heritage, showcasing all the stats, and how our watches evolved together with F1 over the years. And then gradually we will unveil new products related to that. Then we\u2019re going to continue to tell the story of the season. Obviously, Oracle Red Bull Racing continues to be our hugely important partner. We are incredibly proud of Max being the four-time world champion. And we will be looking forward for the fifth this year \u2013 so we will support him massively. And we will continue to work with the team very closely.\n\nTAG Heuer The Silverstone chronograph, introduced in 1974 as the successor to the Monaco, It enjoyed a limited run, with three colourful models in the 1970s and one in the mid-1980s\n\nWhat does the association with Max Verstappen give you?\n\nGeorge Ciz: The ultimate in sports sponsorship. If you don\u2019t have the top player, it\u2019s very difficult to activate [some elements of marketing]. That was the challenge we had over the last few years. Now we get into the \u201cnirvana moment\u201d where we have one of the best sports in the world, together with the world champion. That allows us to tell stories like you can\u2019t imagine, because the rights are easy to manage. In the past, we were limited in terms of the video content from the races themselves. Now we\u2019re working very closely with F1 \u2013 so the video we released today, we put together with their archive team. That allows us to blend the past with the present.\n\nNicholas Biebuyck: That\u2019s exactly it. As the heritage director, what we\u2019re talking about for the brand is to create this red thread \u2013 le feu rouge, as they call it in French \u2013 to connect the past, present and future. And it helps also to talk about the broader audience. The fact that, as you said, F1 has a much broader demographic than it had historically. We can tell narratives in many different ways, in many different formats. It\u2019s the product, it\u2019s the personalities, it\u2019s the teams, it\u2019s the sport as a whole, the sense of competition, the sense of mental resilience \u2013 all of these facets that we can play on are perfectly tailored to Tag Heuer, as a brand. George and I have had many, many conversations over months now, working this out. What can we do? What\u2019s the best way to approach this?\n\nGetty Images Max Verstappen: Number 1\n\nThe fact that you have a watch family called Formula 1 is quite handy.\n\nNicholas Biebuyck: There\u2019s the literal interpretations of the partnership. The Formula 1 collection, the Carrera, the drivers wearing them, the technological development and innovation. I\u2019ve been an F1 fan almost my whole life, and it\u2019s great to have the physical presence \u2013 the clocks, the signage, the partnership with Oracle Red Bull. But, actually, more interesting than that is the spirit of competition, the teamwork. The drivers aren\u2019t always racing against their competition on track. It\u2019s also about qualifying. It\u2019s the mind games, and the press conferences. It\u2019s all of these games and these ideals that we really want to remind everyone of as well.\n\nWhat did you learn from the Kith collaboration?\n\nGeorge Ciz: It was a very ballsy project, I have to say. The way we went about it, the way we changed the logo [the Tag Heuer dial logo was changed to \u201cKith Heuer\u201d \u2013 a contentious decision for some]. Great collabs must come with a surprise, so you have to be prepared \u2013 you need to have a little bit of a stomach for it. You can\u2019t disrupt and feel warm and fuzzy inside. But, what we learned is, number one: people absolutely love these watches \u2013 the one that Nick is wearing, right now, for example [an original 1980s limited edition \u201cUkyo Katayama\u201d]. We could see the passion is there for authentic products from the past. It\u2019s a fantastic prelude to what\u2019s coming up. We also learned that there could be a beautiful crossover between Formula 1 and high-end fashion culture, if you play this the right way. You\u2019ve seen it yourself, in the Museum [About Time attended the Tag Heuer Collectors Summit 2024, at their Swiss HQ], the wealth of ideas and the things that we can bring back and play with and contemporise.\n\nTAG Heuer Last May\u2019s Tag Heuer Formula 1 | Kith collaboration\n\nPresumably you knew the LVMH deal was going to happen when you did the Kith collab?\n\nGeorge Ciz: The stars aligned!\n\nNicholas Biebuyck: It just all coincidentally lined up perfectly, Johnny. We had no idea any of this was going to happen but just magically \u2013 through some amazing coincidence \u2013 all of these pieces fell into place at the same time. We were super-lucky.\n\nMaybe you could reintroduce that original Formula 1 line again?\n\nGeorge Ciz: It\u2019s going to be an exciting year for fans of Tag Heuer. But also, we\u2019re part of a group and it\u2019s been great working with the other brands. We should do a follow-up chat at the end of the year, and you can tell me if you agree with all this!\n\nTAG Heuer An original Formula 1 watch, the first range to bear the names \"Tag\" and \"Heuer\" together on the dial, from 1988\n\nWhat about some of your other lines? The Monaco, the Autavia \u2013 will we see new watches there?\n\nGeorge Ciz: Monaco, certainly \u2013 of course. Autavia is not a strategic priority for the moment. Formula 1, Carrera, Monaco, Aquaracer and the Connected watch. Those are really the five key collections at the moment that we are we are focusing on. And the Monza as well.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to tell me, but I\u2019m going to ask anyway. Do the figures being reported for the deal sound right?\n\nGeorge Ciz: It\u2019s not our place to comment on this. We just have this tremendous opportunity. For us it\u2019s a once in a lifetime opportunity.\n\nTAG Heuer Last year\u2019s limited-edition Carrera Extreme Sport Chronograph x Senna. Released in November to mark the 30th anniversary of the Brazilian driver\u2019s death at the San Marino Grand Prix\n\nAlright, what\u2019s going to be the highlight of the 2025 season, then?\n\nGeorge Ciz: For us there is only one \u2013 Oracle Red Bull Racing and having Max there with [teammate] Liam [Lawson] next to him. We\u2019re so excited to have these guys.\n\nNicholas Biebuyck: You know, 2024 has to be one of the most exciting seasons in Formula 1 history. Every fan who\u2019s been following it for decades can see that what\u2019s been going on has just been incredible. We couldn\u2019t hope for a better season when it came to competition and driver performance. And, you know, the differences between the teams. For 2025, it\u2019s even more again \u2013 Lewis going to Ferrari, Adrian [Newley, legendary F1 designer] going to Aston Martin, Max seriously committed to getting the fifth world championship. I\u2019m excited to attend some races in person. It's always such an amazing place to be. So, yeah. It\u2019s perfect timing for us to be back.\n\nThis story is taken from Esquire's About Time newsletter, style director Johnny Davis\u2019s straight-talking take on the wonderful world of watches.

While the AU$96.5 million prize pool is the tournament\u2019s largest yet, the top players on court made a fair chunk of their fortunes off it last year.\n\n2024 Mens Australian Open Champion Jannik Sinner is looking to defend his title. Image: Getty\n\nWords by Sam Hussey & Josh Lai\n\nFrom lucrative sponsorships to savvy investments, this year\u2019s contenders for the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup and Daphne Akhurst Memorial Trophy are pulling in millions well beyond their on-court winnings.\n\nReigning men\u2019s champion Jannik Sinner is a prime example. Despite raking in millions on the court in 2024, it was the Italian\u2019s off-court portfolio that expanded even faster, with Rolex among his most prominent endorsements alongside the likes of Gucci, skincare line La Roche-Posay and De Cecco pasta.\n\nSinner, who will kick off his title defence against unseeded Chilean Nicholas Jarry, credits much of his success in 2024 to the unique atmosphere at Melbourne Park, where he\u2019s the bookies hot favourite to go back-to-back this month.\n\n\u201cEvery season has its own story, and you never know what will happen, but for us it always starts in Australia which I\u2019m very happy about. I always feel good playing at Melbourne Park; I really love the people and the fans \u2013 there is a great energy,\u201d Sinner said of his pending return to Rod Laver Arena.\n\nMeanwhile, World No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz also returns, leading the next-gen charge at this year\u2019s Open, with endorsements from LVMH, Nike, Babolat and Rolex, while Novak Djokovic remains a commercial powerhouse with deals across Lacoste, Asics and Hublot. Daniil Medvedev, one of the most consistent performers on tour, has his own haul of sponsorship deals, including BMW, Lacoste and Ubisoft.\n\nOn the women\u2019s side, World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka returns to Melbourne park, looking to make history and claim three-straight championships. Away from the court, she\u2019s recently landed a deal with acai franchise Oakberry.\n\nBut perhaps the longest list of off-court endorsements goes to two-time Australian Open winner Naomi Osaka, whose deals include Autograph, Beats by Dre, Etsy, Hyperice, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Meta, Modern Health, Morinaga & Company, Nike, Panasonic, Tag Heuer, Wowow Inc, Yonex and Zico.\n\nThe highest-paid tennis players in 2024\n\n#1. $42.4 million\n\nAGE: 21 | NATIONALITY: Spain | ON-COURT: $10.4 mil \u2022 OFF-COURT: $32 mil\n\nCARL RECINE/GETTY IMAGES\n\n#2. $37.4 million\n\nAGE: 37 | NATIONALITY: Serbia | ON-COURT: $12.4 mil \u2022 OFF-COURT: $25 mil\n\nRVS.MEDIA/ROBERT HRADIL/GETTY IMAGES\n\n#3. $30.2 million\n\nAGE: 23 | NATIONALITY: Italy | ON-COURT: $15.2 mil \u2022 OFF-COURT: $15 mil\n\nDAVID GRAY/AFP/GETTY IMAGES\n\n#4. $27.4 million\n\nAGE: 20 | NATIONALITY: U.S. | ON-COURT: $7.4 mil \u2022 OFF-COURT: $20 mil\n\nDANIEL KOPATSCH/GETTY IMAGES\n\n#5. $27.2 million\n\nAGE: 23 | NATIONALITY: Poland | ON-COURT: $12.2 mil \u2022 OFF-COURT: $15 mil\n\nROBERT PRANGE/GETTY IMAGES\n\n#6. $20.8 million\n\nAGE: 28 | NATIONALITY: Russia | ON-COURT: $7.8 mil \u2022 OFF-COURT: $13 mil\n\nFREY/TPN/GETTY IMAGES\n\n#7. $17.3 million\n\nAGE: 26 | NATIONALITY: Belarus | ON-COURT: $10.3 mil \u2022 OFF-COURT: $7 mil\n\nROBERT PRANGE/GETTY IMAGES\n\n#8. $14.7 million\n\nAGE: 27 | NATIONALITY: Japan | ON-COURT: $0.7 mil \u2022 OFF-COURT: $14 mil\n\nICON SPORTSWIRE/GETTY IMAGES\n\n#9. $14.2 million\n\nCasper Ruud\n\nAGE: 26 | NATIONALITY: Norway | ON-COURT: $4.2 mil \u2022 OFF-COURT: $10 mil\n\nFRANCO ARLAND/GETTY IMAGES\n\n*All on-court earnings figures reflect prize money and Olympic medal bonuses collected over 12 months, dating up to the completion of the 2024 U.S. Open.\n\nAustralian Open prize money\n\nThe Australian Open prize pool has risen by 11 per cent from the previous year, totalling AU$96.5 million.

The court, celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, has been the backdrop for countless defining moments\u2014from Novak Djokovic\u2019s record 10 titles to Caroline Wozniacki\u2019s emotional maiden major win.\n\nRolex, which has been the tournament\u2019s Official Timekeeper since 2008, has had a front-row seat for much of it. For Rod Laver, seeing his name on the arena remains a career highlight.\n\n\u201cRolex being part of the Australian Open is important for tennis and for our country on the global stage,\u201d Laver says. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible partnership and one that I have seen thrive over many years.\u201d\n\nSix-time Australian Open Champion Roger Federer.

Tokyo-born artist and animator Shu Yonezawa has been selected as the program\u2019s newest artist in residence and will spend the tenure at Kuroki, a denim manufacturer in Okayama, Japan.

Launched in 2015, the program supports innovative approaches to traditional craftsmanship across LVMH\u2019s divisions.

Tackling so-called \u201cgreedflation,\u201d explaining its recent rash of management changes, and fixing Dior, where the women\u2019s business is \u201cunder pressure.\u201d\n\nSo says HSBC in a new report on LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which is due to report fourth-quarter sales in the coming weeks.\n\nThe bank maintains a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock and is forecasting a \u201cslight improvement\u201d at group level \u2014 a 2 percent decline, versus 3 percent in the third quarter \u2014 and at its linchpin fashion and leather goods division: a 4 percent erosion versus 5 percent for the previous quarter.\n\n\u201cWe remain convinced, for the sector as well as for LVMH, that Chinese consumption has not deteriorated further since Q3 2024, while American consumption of luxury has picked up convincingly since the early November 2024 election,\u201d said the report, which lists as authors the analysts Erwan Rambourg, Anne-Laure Bismuth and Aurelie Husson-Dumoutier.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nIt also noted that LVMH is the luxury group that is most exposed to the U.S. consumer \u2014 therefore the biggest winner from any improvements \u2014 and the biggest beneficiary from recent strength in the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe report also addressed head-on a slowdown at Dior, which it ranks as the group\u2019s biggest contributor of profits at the level of earnings before interest and taxes after its flagship Louis Vuitton brand.\n\nHSBC estimated revenues at Dior almost quadrupled from 2.7 billion euros in 2018 to exceed 9 billion euros in 2023 \u2014 comparative to the explosive growth Gucci experienced under designer Alessandro Michele, growth that quickly fizzled and has yet to improve under his successor, Sabato De Sarno.\n\n\u201c\u2019Does this make Dior the next Gucci?\u2019 is a question we are often asked,\u201d the report said. \u201cOur view is that it is absolutely not the case because management focus and brand investments have been unwavering and the brand has not had a major creative shift like at Gucci. Moreover, some would argue that Dior is less fashion-driven.\u201d\n\nThat said, HSBC argued that designs from Dior have become \u201ca bit stale and repetitive,\u201d with men\u2019s goods by designer Kim Jones \u201cdoing well still\u201d and women\u2019s goods by Maria Grazia Chiuri \u201cunder more pressure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on our seven-year rule, it could be time for the brand to shift designers for the latter,\u201d the report said, flagging the possibility that Loewe\u2019s fashion star Jonathan Anderson \u201ccould take over from Ms. Chiuri eventually.\u201d\n\nHSBC argued Dior \u2014 like Saint Laurent and Burberry \u2014 drove up prices too quickly in recent years, alienating many luxury consumers. It expects the fashion house to \u201cwork on new collections that offer a better value proposition\u201d rather than lowering prices.\n\nIt also applauded the recent recruitment of Miu Miu chief executive officer Benedetta Petruzzo as managing director of Dior Couture, which \u201ccould enable a brand reboot, focusing on innovation and product creativity, without changing designers.\u201d\n\nHSBC said a recent rash of management changes at LVMH at the corporate level, and its wines and spirits division, also ranks as a top investor concern.\n\n\u201cOur take overall is that the group is not reacting to external pressures (weak sales), rather, going through teething issues as there is an assumption that control will eventually trickle down from the current CEO, Bernard Arnault, to his five children, who are all employed by the group,\u201d said the report, characterizing concerns as \u201cpremature\u201d as Arnault, 75, recently extended his leadership mandate to age 80.\n\n\u201cGiven the quality of managers within the group as well as the experience of all five Arnault descendants\u2026we believe the group has many qualified future leaders in-house and has, if needed, the potential to attract more talent,\u201d it said.",

Louis Vuitton \u00d7 Murakami is celebrating these creations with an extensive range of renowned and hotly coveted women\u2019s leather goods and accessories. They include iconic City Bags, silk squares and scarves, sunglasses, fashion jewelry, shoes and perfumes. Each of the pieces has been re-fashioned to take advantage of advances in technology. Combined with Louis Vuitton\u2019s storied savoir-faire and artisanal culture, this has enabled an unprecedented degree of definition for the prints, rendering colors more resplendent than ever while enhancing the precision of Murakami\u2019s motifs and characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Louis Vuitton x Murakami re-edition will be showcased in an immersive environment spanning window displays, pop-up stores and corners, edgy in-store activations and a special ad campaign.\n\n\n\nThe first chapter of Louis Vuitton \u00d7 Murakami drops at the beginning of January.

            "content": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Bernard Arnault just got a hotline to some more bling. But he might have to wait for the call.\n\nHis LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE has agreed to invest in Moncler SpA, the Italian luxury brand best known for the padded down jacket worn by Drake in the \u201cHotline Bling\u201d music video.\n\nArnault, the chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, might not be about to immediately fold Moncler into his luxury empire. But he is in pole position if ever Chairman and CEO Remo Ruffini were to sell. And, along the way, Moncler could transform itself into an Italian LVMH \u2014 making it an even more useful addition to Arnault\u2019s portfolio.\n\nLVMH has acquired a 10% stake in Double R, the investment vehicle through which the Ruffini family holds its interest in Moncler. Double R owns a 15.8% stake in Moncler, implying an indirect 1.58% for LVMH. Shares in Moncler rose as much as 15%.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, LVMH will increase its stake in Double R to 22%, lifting its interest in Moncler to 4%. It will also have two seats on the Double R board, and one at Moncler.\n\nThe transaction is a surprising one. For a start, Moncler has been a strong performer, thanks to its core outerwear offerings, primarily those down jackets, and the excitement created through its Genius program, whereby it works with a roster of outside designers and hosts events in different locations around the world. As with the rest of the luxury sector, its sales growth has slowed and its shares fallen \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t need support from LVMH.\n\nThough Moncler would of course be a useful addition to the French giant\u2019s fashion and leather goods division, the group has more obvious white space to fill, primarily in watches, skincare and hospitality.\n\nBut Ruffini has traditionally worked with a partner at the investment company level. This was first Singapore\u2019s state investor Temasek, then the Rivetti family, known for Stone Island, the Italian casual fashion brand Moncler bought four years ago. The latter recently exited, creating an opening. What better partner to have next than LVMH, the world\u2019s biggest luxury company, blessed with a strong balance sheet and some of the industry\u2019s biggest brands?\n\nWith the purchase of Stone Island, Moncler signaled that it was a buyer, opening the potential for it to become a new house of luxury. LVMH could provide further firepower, and with valuations tumbling, there could be fresh opportunities. Burberry Group Plc, for example, is expected to focus on outerwear under new CEO Joshua Schulman, making the British luxury brand potentially interesting for Moncler.\n\nIn turn, LVMH gets a fresh collaboration partner for its maisons, including Louis Vuitton and Dior, as well as a window into one of its most successful competitors.\n\nBy adding to Moncler\u2019s stable, Ruffini also demonstrated that he was not a seller of the whole company. Arnault said in a statement on Thursday that he supported \u201cthe independence of the Moncler Group.\u201d\n\nBut with the investment, Arnault has put down a marker. He would be poised to strike if ever Ruffini were to seek a deal. That might be some ways off \u2014 Ruffini is 63, while Arnault is 75 \u2014 but LVMH has just leapfrogged competitors to the front of the queue.\n\nArch-rival Kering SA isn\u2019t in a state to acquire right now. It is grappling with the turnaround of Gucci, while net debt excluding lease liabilities has swelled to \u20ac9.9 billion ($11.1 billion). But if it can revive Gucci and get other brands such as Balenciaga firing on all cylinders again, this hiatus may not last forever. Kering looked at Moncler in 2019, but a deal never came to fruition.\n\nArnault has taken a similar approach before, investing in Tod\u2019s SpA and supporting its CEO Diego Della Valle until he was ready to delist the company earlier this year with LVMH-backed private equity firm L Catterton.\n\nLuxury is all about the long term and acquiring the most prized assets: Once they are snapped up by a rival, they don\u2019t come onto the market again. Even the Wolf in Cashmere is prepared to be patient for the brands that matter most.\n\nMore From Bloomberg Opinion:\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nAndrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering consumer goods and the retail industry.

            "content": "When news spread this weekend that the LVMH-affiliated private equity firm L Catterton had quietly taken a majority stake in Kapital, it didn\u2019t take long for \u201cRIP\u201d comments to start appearing under the cult Japanese label\u2019s latest Instagram post.\n\nThe deal, which was first noticed by Reddit users and then reported by Highsnobiety, seemed tailor-made to ruffle feathers, at least with online fashion enthusiasts. Derek Guy, a popular menswear commenter known as DieWorkwear on social media, simply called the news \u201cterrible.\u201d\n\nThe concern is that what made Kapital special \u2014 its painstaking craftsmanship, its unconventional mix of Japanese tradition and hippie Americana \u2014 would be lost under the management of private equity, an industry that has a reputation for diluting brands as it scales them to sell for a profit. Historically, cult labels haven\u2019t always fared well when sold to a new owner with an eye on growth, with Supreme offering a recent example .\n\nThe nearly 40-year-old, family-run label has remained small even as it has developed a global following. Kapital only has 13 stores in Japan and is notorious for producing limited stock of its most coveted goods, such as handcrafted Japanese boro denim, while also being highly selective about its global wholesale accounts, which include Mr. Porter and boutique shops such as New York\u2019s Blue in Green.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDesigner Kiro Hirata \u2014 son of the brand\u2019s late founder, Toshikiyo Hirata, who died last year \u2014 gives few interviews, and the company hasn\u2019t outwardly signalled any desire for rapid expansion, though it has delved into offering more mainstream products like graphic T-shirts and enjoys a flourishing fandom among hype-driven streetwear consumers.\n\nL Catterton, meanwhile, is a large player in private equity known for its backing from LVMH and investments in brands such as APC, Etro, Ganni and Birkenstock, which it took public in late 2023. It also invests in consumer goods beyond apparel.\n\nThe deal arrives at a moment when there\u2019s increased M&A activity within the broader consumer space, particularly for buzzy fashion labels. In November, LVMH\u2019s venture arm invested in Our Legacy and Represent sold a minority stake to private equity firm True. Pitchbook private equity analyst Jinny Choi said L Catterton has been \u201cquite active\u201d within the past year and credits strong M&A activity to cash-rich firms injecting funds into companies during times of economic uncertainty.\n\n\u201cI think at the end of the day, we\u2019ll see a lot of companies turn towards M&A as a strategy to strengthen their market positioning during these volatile times,\u201d said Choi.\n\nNeither L Catterton nor Kapital has disclosed details about the investment, but the pairing raises questions for Kapital fans and industry onlookers alike about L Catterton\u2019s interest in a niche Japanese brand and what Kapital\u2019s future might hold.\n\nWhat L Catterton Could Gain From Kapital\n\nNikhil Thukral, managing partner at L Catterton, told The Business of Fashion in an interview last year that he defines a winning fashion company as one with a clear understanding of its customer and how it fits into their world.\n\nKapital definitely has that.\n\nWhile it originally gained a following with its denim, today it\u2019s known for a wide range of meticulously made products, often featuring embellishments like distressing or graphics, and counts mainstream menswear style icons such as A$AP Rocky and Travis Scott among its fans. In November, social-analytics platform Trendalytics reported that the number of TikTok posts about Kapital increased 400 percent over the past year. Even the brand\u2019s most idiosyncratic products have been counterfeited.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKapital also fits with the growing interest among menswear shoppers for niche brands with their own distinct identities.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of fatigue around the same big brands, designers and creative directors who are constantly moving around, and increasing interest in independent brands that seem out of that fray a little bit,\u201d said Highsnobiety editor-in-chief Noah Johnson, who was previously GQ\u2019s global style director. \u201cPower in the menswear marketplace right now is in these smaller homegrown brands that have been around for years with a proven cult-like following. I would imagine that Kapital is pretty desirable for that reason.\u201d\n\nMore Than Just a Brand\n\nLoic Bizel, a Japan-based consultant who has helped luxury companies such as LVMH and Richemont connect with the Japanese market, believes L Catterton\u2019s investment in Kapital differs from investments the firm has made in other apparel brands. In his view, L Catterton is also hoping to benefit from its know-how on the production of the label\u2019s highly coveted and distinctive artisanal denim.\n\nKapital runs four sewing factories and one dyeing factory, according to the profile page on its website. While the brand is quiet about its production prowess, interviews published with brand employees in the past reveal a slow manufacturing process done by hand , which makes some of the label\u2019s most coveted items, such as its Century Denim, nearly impossible to buy \u2014 even within Japan, let alone international markets \u2014 due to limited production runs.\n\n\u201cThere are very few factories actually making Japanese denim, so I see it as a way to secure some sourcing,\u201d said Bizel, who pointed out that Japan\u2019s highly regarded denim industry is built on small workshops.\n\nWhether or not L Catterton wants direct access to Kapital\u2019s facilities itself, the brand\u2019s production abilities were clearly a draw. In its description of Kapital on its website, L Catterton highlighted its expert craftsmen and the fusion of traditional techniques with creative designs at its ateliers in Japan.\n\nWhat Scaling Kapital Could Look Like\n\nWhile Bizel does anticipate Kapital expanding its distribution, he believes its unique craftsmanship and production methods mean it doesn\u2019t have the ability to open 1,000 stores or become a $1 billion brand, at least not without compromising its DNA. The fear among its fans is that\u2019s exactly what will happen.\n\n\u201cI get worried when brands expand because I believe expansion brings in compromises that I don\u2019t think are very good for the purist,\u201d Derek Guy said in an interview.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGuy believes the brand has already been leaning away from its artisan offerings to appeal to more streetwear-leaning customers in recent years. He pointed out how Kapital trucker caps, graphic T-shirts and apparel with its signature smiley-face logos and bone motifs have become \u201cluxury flex items\u201d amongst the streetwear set.\n\nThose items might be where the biggest opportunity for quick growth lies and don\u2019t require Kapital\u2019s usual artisanal expertise to produce. By contrast, Guy said he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine many people wearing boro [denim] jackets and persimmon-dyed boots.\u201d (Dyeing materials with persimmon juice is one of Kapital\u2019s unusual techniques.)\n\nNeither L Catterton nor Kapital has said what their plans are, and neither replied to requests for comment. Kapital is unlike most M&A targets for private equity deals, meaning there isn\u2019t much precedent on what to expect, akin to Supreme receiving investment from the Carlyle Group in 2017.\n\nL Catterton\u2019s Thukral did tell BoF that another characteristic of what the firm views as winning fashion companies is being able to \u201cdefine and be true to your DNA.\u201d\n\nFor Kapital, that would mean maintaining the approach that has sustained it over the decades, even as it potentially tries to reach more shoppers and expand its audience at home and abroad.",

Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company\u2019s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study ROE in this article.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne is:\n\n22% = \u20ac15b \u00f7 \u20ac66b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every \u20ac1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of \u20ac0.22.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nLVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne's Earnings Growth And 22% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 18% which is quite remarkable. So, the substantial 23% net income growth seen by LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne over the past five years isn't overly surprising.\n\nWe then performed a comparison between LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 23% in the same 5-year period.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is MC fairly valued? This has everything you need to know.\n\nIs LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nLVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne has a three-year median payout ratio of 43% (where it is retaining 57% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the high growth we discussed above, it looks like LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.\n\nMoreover, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 54% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the higher expected payout ratio.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

            "content": "LVMH-backed L Catterton's acquisition of Kapital, a Japanese clothing brand celebrated for its artisanal denim and Americana-inspired designs that was founded in the 1980s, has sparked concerns among enthusiasts and industry observers.\n\nThe acquisition, finalised in the second half of 2024 according to High Snobiety, came just months after founder Toshikiyo Hirata's death in April. The deal marks a watershed moment for the Kojima-based brand, as majority control shifts from Hirata's son Kiro to the world's largest luxury conglomerate. Neither party publicly announced the transaction, though industry sources suggest the terms were sufficiently attractive to persuade the founding family to relinquish control of the business they had built over four decades.\n\nThe deal represents LVMH's growing interest in heritage craft businesses, following L Catterton's successful acquisitions of Birkenstock and A.P.C. However, it raises questions about the future direction of a brand that has built its reputation by steering its own course, producing limited production runs, being selective with distribution, and focusing on local craft and uncompromising quality standards.\n\nCritics (and fans of the brand) fear that such acquisitions by large luxury conglomerates may lead to market dominance, a loss of creative independence, disappearing craftsmanship and cultural misalignment.\n\nIn an interview with GQ in 2019 Kiro said: \u201cLooking back at the history of jeans, the oldest jeans from Levi's are about 100 years old. Jeans originated in the USA, and my father perfectly mastered the reproduction. So I thought it was my turn to create something new and not just repeat what has already been done. I wanted to create something for the next 100 years into the future.\u201d\n\nThat future is now set to be shaped by LVMH. While L Catterton holds the majority stake, it\u2019s important to note they are not the sole owners. More significantly, LVMH lacks the deep market expertise in Japan that it commands elsewhere, suggesting this acquisition could be part of a broader strategy to strengthen its foothold in Asia. Although there\u2019s no indication that the brand\u2019s dedication to craftsmanship will falter under corporate stewardship, there remains the lingering concern of it evolving into \u201cjust another LVMH brand.\u201d\n\nUnique and authentic\n\nThe unique and authentic design ethos that defines Kapital could be diluted as it aligns with the broader strategies and profit motives of a large corporation. While owning Kapital is certainly not going to pay LVMH huge dividends, their interest in a small Japanese brand is telling.\n\nKapital's deep roots in Japanese and Americana heritage and its niche appeal certainly clashes with the globalised, high marketing approach of LVMH\u2019s core brands. Such a route would erode the brand's distinct identity.\n\nThese concerns are amplified by the recent passing of Kapital's founder, raising questions about the future direction of the brand and how it will honour his legacy under new ownership. Let\u2019s not forget that LVMH sold Virgil Abloh\u2019s brand Off-White to a brand management company three years after his death.\n\nWhile L Catterton\u2019s previous acquisition of brands like Birkenstock and A.P.C. did little to alter their core identities, they have become ubiquitous with huge global distribution channels. There isn\u2019t a major city in the world where neither brand\u2019s products can be purchased.\n\nThis acquisition also signals LVMH's strategic interest in craft-focused brands with strong cultural narratives. While Kapital's scale is modest compared to LVMH's portfolio brands, its influence in the premium denim market is significant.\n\nThe transaction comes amid broader consolidation in the luxury sector, where conglomerates are increasingly acquiring specialist manufacturers and artisanal brands.\n\nHowever, the challenge for LVMH will be maintaining Kapital's credibility among its devoted customer base while pursuing growth opportunities.\n\nThe financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.",

            "content": "Big pharma without trimming the fat\n\nOne of the largest holdings in the $37.9m (\u00a329.8m) Antipodes Global fund, which contains 75 stocks \u2013 is a large-cap pharma name which isn\u2019t dependent on popular weight-loss drugs.\n\nAlison Savas, investment director at Antipodes Partners, has high conviction in Sanofi, a leading immunology healthcare firm headquartered in France.\n\n\u201cIts strengths lie in that it does not face any patent risk this decade, it has a much lower exposure to US drug pricing risk than peers, a deep pipeline, a dominant vaccines business and a leading consumer healthcare business that it\u2019s in the process of monetising,\u201d Savas told Portfolio Adviser.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t all been smooth-sailing for the multinational company, however; Sanofi\u2019s share price fell by more than 20% last year after it pledged to increase its research and development (R&D) investing by 10% to \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.4bn) annually during 2024 and \u201925.\n\nSavas said prioritising pipeline development over short-term earnings growth \u201cspooked the market\u201d, although her team used this as an opportunity to increase the fund\u2019s exposure.\n\n\u201cCentral to Sanofi\u2019s investment thesis is a pharma portfolio that isn\u2019t facing patent cliffs. It has an emerging powerhouse on its hands with Dupixent, used to treat allergic diseases such as dermatitis and asthma, currently generating around \u20ac13bn in annual revenue and outperforming market expectations,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cDespite its size, Dupixent can see low double-digit growth per annum into the next decade due to greater penetration of existing indications, younger age groups, new geographies and a recent approval to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD (chronic bronchitis) \u2013 a large additional patient population.\n\n\u201cThis is not properly reflected in analyst forecasts,\u201d Savas said.\n\nWhat is even more appealing, according to the investment director, is that the company isn\u2019t solely dependent on the success of Dupixent. It also holds business of so-called \u201corphan drugs\u201d, used to treat rare diseases, which are typically high-cost but high-profit.\n\n\u201cCombined with exciting new launches, these account for an extra \u20ac7bn in revenue, growing at a high single-digit pace.\n\n\u201cOn top of this Sanofi has a full pipeline focused around its key areas of strength. Any positive readouts in 2025 will increase the market\u2019s confidence in the pipeline and vindicate the decision to pivot strategy. A solid balance sheet also leaves room for acquisitions to further bolster its pipeline.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Savas said Sanofi\u2019s \u20ac7.5bn vaccines business is growing faster than market expectations.\n\n\u201cVaccines are a sticky, long-duration business with high barriers to entry due to stringent approval requirements and scale manufacturing. Sanofi is one of three scale providers of the flu vaccine, with polio and meningitis vaccines also in its stable.\n\n\u201cParticularly promising is the new RSV vaccine, which targets a virus that can cause severe respiratory infections, particularly in children. Expanded production capacity positions Sanofi to meet rising demand, adding another growth driver.\u201d\n\nFinally, she referred to Opella \u2013 Sanofi\u2019s consumer health business \u2013 which recently attracted a \u20ac16bn private equity deal, with Sanofi retaining a 48% stake. The division predominantly offers household-name, over-the-counter treatments and supplements.\n\n\u201cOnce finalised, the transaction could unlock capital for share buybacks or strategic investments \u2013 moves likely to be rewarded by the market,\u201d Savas said.\n\n\u201cAt 12x earnings, with earnings forecast to grow around 10% per annum, there\u2019s a lot to like about Sanofi. While the share price has regained almost all it lost on last year\u2019s R&D announcement, there are multiple catalysts coming over the next 12 to 24 months that can drive the shares higher.\u201d\n\nHandbags and gladrags\n\nLuxury goods companies such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al in cosmetics and LVMH in fashion have proven resilient despite a global deceleration in consumer spending globally, according to Ben Peters, fund manager of the Evenlode Global Income fund.\n\nBut while revenue for the likes of these names has continued to rise, growth has still slowed on a relative basis, which the manager said has led markets to mark down the share prices of some firms \u201cquite significantly\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have responded by growing these positions over time. We have increased L\u2019Or\u00e9al from 2.7% of the portfolio at the start of the year to 3.8%, and LVMH from 2.8% to 3.3%,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs their stock prices are down by 20% and 13%, respectively, in sterling terms over the year so far, valuations look good in an absolute and a relative sense.\u201d\n\nPeters said famous fashion houses stand the test of time and avoid the cyclicality of lower-budget brands.\n\nBecause luxury brands are perceived to be higher quality, more durable and therefore more valuable than their non-luxury counterparts, the manager believes they offer \u201cresilience in the event of an economic downturn\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have held LVMH for some time, and Richemont has also recently been under our microscope although has not yet made it into our investable universe,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth companies are \u2018houses of brands\u2019, in other words a collection of well-diversified luxury businesses serving multiple end markets. For example, half of LVMH\u2019s income derives from fashion and leather, with the other half coming from perfumes, watches and alcoholic beverages, among others.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Richemont focuses predominantly on luxury jewellery and watches, with Cartier one of its leading brands, although it also has a smaller segment offering luxury clothing and apparel.\n\n\u201cRichemont operates somewhere between LVMH and Herm\u00e8s in terms of the tier of luxury goods it sells,\u201d Peters explained. \u201cIts jewellery brands and watch portfolio is undoubtedly in the very top tier of luxury goods, by both price and reputation. Its soft luxury brands, on the other hand, may not be quite as high tier when compared with their rivals in the space, and they are getting out of the online market business by selling Yoox Net-a-Porter (YNAP), an acquisition that never really got going.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the jewellery segment of luxury remains quite fragmented, providing opportunities for further consolidation where, YNAP aside, they have historically proven to be shrewd operators in M&A.\u201d\n\nDespite short-term headwinds, the manager is positive on the prospects for the luxury segment.\n\n\u201cOn balance it seems unlikely that high-net-worth and aspirational wealthy consumers will eschew handbags and gladrags any time soon. Exactly where around the world the growth is driven from may change though, making a multinational approach appealing.\n\n\u201cWhile consumer spending could remain soft in the short term, the valuations at which some luxury companies are trading relative to history offsets these challenges.\u201d\n\nLearning curve\n\nEducation has long been preached as an investment in the next generation by parents and teachers alike, and for Steven Tredget, partner at Oakley Capital, it\u2019s a valuable part of the portfolio.\n\n\u201cEducation is a subscription,\u201d said Tredget. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the last things you will change, if you can avoid changing.\u201d\n\nFrom an investment perspective, this means a steady stream of income that is able to withstand economic wobbles. Tredget saw the opportunity to combine the longstanding success of education with technology, by investing in the mainly online university IU Group.\n\nThe German private university was founded in 2000 and targets a different group of students than a traditional university. \u201cThe average age of an IU group student is 27, and 70% of them do not come from a family background of higher education,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re in work or have families, and so they are looking to study on terms that suit them. These are highly modular degrees, so you can create one to suit you. Often people choose professional-type bachelors based on the fact they\u2019re already working and want something quite specific.\u201d\n\nThe university is now the largest and fastest-growing in Germany, with more than 140,000 students enrolled. Tredget believes some of this success is due to the business model, which is not focused on research or attracting international students, but on offering a service to its consumer.\n\n\u201cThis is like any customer service. It\u2019s asking what customers value and focusing on that output. What they typically value is the outcomes of degrees,\u201d Tredget said.\n\n\u201cThe average salary increases by 20%, and now their degree time is shortening as well.\u201d\n\nRecently, this has been aided by the launch of an AI teaching assistant, called Syntea, which has cut the time it takes to complete a degree by almost a quarter.\n\n\u201cStudents will ask 10 times more questions of Syntea than they would a physical professor, because she\u2019s always available. Second, they\u2019re not embarrassed to ask the stupid questions, and so Syntea learns much more about the student,\u201d Tredget said.\n\nOakley first invested in IU Group in 2018, when the university was operating at a much smaller scale. When the investment came to fruition, it was too large for Oakley to remain the sole control investor. Oakley now has the holding in a continuation vehicle alongside a group of other investors.\n\nIt\u2019s a story that\u2019s not uncommon for Oakley, which invests primarily in companies that are not yet large enough to be considered by large-scale private equity firms. Tredget said the firm often works with companies that are diving into the world of private equity for the first time, with some deals taking years to build trust with the owners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too much hassle for the larger firms to come down that far,\u201d Tredget said. \u201cWe don\u2019t tend to find much competition. Three quarters of our deals are outside the auction process, so they\u2019re a bilateral conversation between us and the founder.\u201d\n\nThis article first appeared in the December issue of Portfolio Adviser magazine",

            "content": "Mystery surrounding shares owned by Herm\u00e8s heir fuels speculation By\n\nAFP Translated by\n\nNicola Mira Published\n\nJanuary 7, 2025\n\nAs one of the heirs of luxury group claims his fortune has vanished, the question is whether he has sold part of his shares to , or placed them in a trust. The mystery remains unresolved, according to an investigation by Swiss press group Tamedia, which has unearthed several possible leads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFP\n\n\n\nTamedia, which notably owns Geneva newspaper La Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve, published a long report on Sunday about the intricate case of the Herm\u00e8s shares owned by Nicolas Puech. The latter, a great-grandson of the French leather goods label's founder, inherited more than 6 million shares, equivalent to a 5.76% stake in Herm\u00e8s. At the current price, Puech\u2019s shares are worth CHF13 billion (\u20ac13.8 billion), and Puech is claiming they have been stolen from him.\n\n\n\nTamedia wrote that the investigation has pored over \u201chundreds of pages of legal and financial documents\u201d which \u201cdo not reveal where the shares are now but, as though in a treasure hunt, map the sequence of events that led to their disappearance.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tamedia\u2019s newspapers, Switzerland-based Puech, now in his eighties and the largest individual shareholder in Herm\u00e8s, has claimed that his shares \u201cvanished\u201d as a result of unspecified \u201cstratagems.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a complaint filed in Geneva in 2023, Puech accused his former wealth manager, Swiss businessman Eric Freymond, alongside the president of wealth management office Phidias Gestion, of having \u201ccleverly misappropriated\u201d his assets, without explaining how this happened, wrote Tamedia. Puech\u2019s complaint against Freymond was dismissed.\n\n\n\nThe first possible lead Tamedia has followed to shed light on the disappearance of \u201cthis treasure\u201d concerns the stake in Herm\u00e8s which was quietly acquired by luxury giant LVMH, amounting eventually to 23%.\n\n\n\nAccording to the investigation, bank accounts in Geneva belonging to Puech had been used to make \u201csubtle arrangements\u201d designed to feed into 's empire \u201cmillions of Herm\u00e8s shares.\u201d This raises the question of whether Puech has in fact sold part of his shares, perhaps even \u201cwithout necessarily being aware of it, since he did not manage these accounts himself,\u201d according to Tamedia\u2019s newspapers.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis theory has the merit of being simple,\u201d but \u201cthere are various elements contradicting it, suggesting instead that the billionaire may have been able to hide his shares elsewhere,\u201d according to the investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nBahamas bank account\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report\u2019s author speculated that Puech, caught between \u201cLVMH\u2019s overtures and the pressure exerted by his family,\u201d with which his relationship is \u201ccold,\u201d may have \u201csought to shelter his shares early on,\u201d perhaps by resorting to a \u201ctrust.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe report cited a message sent by Puech to his wealth manager, in which the former said he had transferred his securities into a \u201ctrust,\u201d and mentioned a trip made to the Bahamas in 2013 by Puech and Freymond, during which a bank account was opened. Puech\u2019s goal was to shift part of his assets outside Switzerland for tax avoidance purposes, said a person who was \u201caware of this trip\u201d cited in the report, which didn\u2019t name the person in question. However, according to the same source, this shift did not involve Puech\u2019s Herm\u00e8s shares.\n\n\n\nAt this stage, it is \u201cimpossible\u201d to know whether these shares have been transferred \u201caway from Geneva,\u201d or whether Puech did create this \u201ctrust,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, who for the time being can only continue to cross-check sources and documents.\n\n\n\nA third possibly lead explored by the investigation was that of an \u201coversight.\u201d The report mentioned conflicting statements made by Puech\u2019s lawyer, who said that his client hasn\u2019t gone under. \u201cMy client doesn\u2019t know anything, he wasn\u2019t involved, he forgot,\u201d his lawyer reportedly said during a conversation with Puech\u2019s former wealth manager and a foundation to which Puech had initially promised to leave his fortune.\n\n\n\nThe mystery surrounding Puech's shares has been the subject of various press investigations, but hasn\u2019t yet been solved.\n\n\n\n\u201cNicolas Puech's lawyers have made enquiries with banks, lawyers and family offices,\u201d including Phidias Gestion, and \u201cwe should therefore know more in the coming months,\u201d said Tamedia's newspapers.\n\n\n\nContacted by the AFP agency, Phidias Gestion has declined to comment.",

While figures vary across reports \u2014 some publications put the decrease at US$32 billion (c. $50 billion AUD) and others at US$53 billion (c. $85 billion AUD) \u2014 everyone agrees that a significant sum was wiped from Arnault\u2019s personal fortune.\n\nNevertheless, he is still among the richest individuals on the planet, but the scale of these losses underscores broader challenges facing global luxury brands in a time of apparently neverending economic uncertainty. Here\u2019s a closer look at how LVMH has fared and how Arnault plans to make this cash back\u2026\n\nLVMH\u2019s Slide\n\nDemand for the group\u2019s most prestigious brands \u2014 including Louis Vuitton, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, and TAG Heuer \u2014 dropped in several key markets last year. China, by far the company\u2019s most important market, was particularly weak, while Europe also showed unwelcome signs of slowing consumer demand. Relentless inflation, a global economic downturn, and more ephemeral shifting consumer habits are some of the factors contributing to this pronounced dip.\n\nLVMH\u2019s shares dropped by 13% through 2024, reflecting a wider market correction. The group\u2019s sales were flat for the first nine months of the year, culminating in a 2% fall in net sales compared to the same period prior year. Interestingly, the Mo\u00ebt Hennessy wines and spirits division bore the brunt of this decline, with a punchy 11% revenue drop. Cognac sales struggled in both China and the US, forcing LVMH to resort to never-endearing discounting tactics to clear stock. After a decade of exponential growth, this not only marked a change in fortunes for the group but also highlighted the more widespread vulnerability of the luxury sector amid ongoing global shocks.\n\nImage: Tyrone Siu\n\nNevertheless, LVMH continued to grab headlines as a lead supporter of the Paris Olympics and for contributing over \u20ac1 billion to the restoration of Notre Dame; savvy moves despite the setbacks elsewhere. However, even such high-profile endeavours could not fully offset the challenges facing the company, and Arnault opted for a big reshuffle within the organisation, moving former Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony to head Mo\u00ebt Hennessy and appointing one of his sons, Alexandre Arnault, as Deputy CEO of the wines and spirits division.\n\nResilience in the Face of Turbulence\n\nOn the personal level: While Bernard Arnault\u2019s net worth may have dropped precipitously \u2014 from around US$231 billion \u2014 he still stands a comfortable sixth on the global rich list at roughly US$178 billion. His massive stake in LVMH, through a network of holding companies and trusts, remains his towering asset. Analysts have repeatedly said that Arnault\u2019s willingness to buy more than US$100 million worth of the group\u2019s stock in recent months is a sign of unwavering confidence in its longer-term prospects.\n\nMarket gurus maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook for LVMH, chalking up a rebound in demand for high-end goods in China and continued robust performance in the US, where LVMH typically outperforms its competitors by a comfortable margin. Some predict organic sales growth of around 4% in 2025, though potential tariff disputes in both Beijing and Washington loom\u2026\n\nImage: Kevin Lamarque\n\nIn the longer term, a Deloitte Private study projects that ultra-rich families, including those like Arnault\u2019s, could see their combined wealth soar by 2030 from US$5.5 trillion to a massive US$9.5 trillion by 2030. Therefore, while the downturn of 2024 may have been painful for the moneybags of the world, it appears to be a temporary blip rather than a permanent setback.",

Image credit: LVMH/Philippe Servent\n\nDuring a year in luxury defined by a worldwide sales downturn, many brands leveraged powerful messages and immersive experiences to assert their relevance and reach.\n\nAccording to the latest data from global consulting firm Bain & Co., the personal luxury goods market is currently worth upwards of $370 billion, down 2 percent year-on-year; only about a third of all luxury brands are expected to emerge with positive revenue growth, dropping from two-thirds in 2023.\n\nOverall, while outlier booms across Japan and Southern Europe offered bright spots, challenging economic conditions and slowed spending from shoppers in established markets including the U.S. and China shaped the luxury business landscape last year, calling for innovation as well as expansion into emerging luxury regions such as India.\n\nA number of players rose to the occasion, launching strategic efforts designed to captivate consumers, from French luxury conglomerate LVMH\u2019s historic sponsorship of the Paris 2024 Olympics, to individual contributions from the likes of German automaker Mercedes-Benz, French jeweler Boucheron and Scottish whiskey maker The Macallan.\n\nSome embraced localized storytelling as others pushed forward with bold collaborations to forge deeper connections with their audiences. The increased fusion of luxury branding at tentpole cultural events, from international design weeks and film festivals to Formula 1 races, underscored the sector\u2019s continued evolution in the lifestyle space.\n\nAs the new year kicks off, Luxury Daily reflects on the campaigns and activations that resonated in 2024.\n\nGoing for gold\n\nIn July 2023, LVMH announced its role as a premium partner of the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, held in Paris. From lead-up activities to opening and closing ceremonies, multiple LVMH-owned brands were involved with the first-time sponsorship.\n\nFrench jeweler Chaumet created the competition's gold, silver and bronze medals, becoming the first jeweler to design the awards (see story).\n\n\u201cThis first-ever Olympic medal created by a jeweler is emblematic of LVMH\u2019s role as creative partner of the Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024,\u201d said Antoine Arnault, overseer of image and environment and member of the board of directors at LVMH, in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn a close creative dialogue between Paris 2024 and Chaumet, the artisans of the Maison delved into their archives and explored powerful symbols of Olympism to imagine a medal inspired by high jewelry creations,\u201d Mr. Arnault said. \u201cBuilding on its centuries of rich history, Chaumet is writing a new page that will remain engraved in the heritage of the maison for eternity.\u201d\n\nItalian footwear and leather goods brand Berluti designed uniforms for Team France.\n\nThe pieces were worn during the Paris 2024 Opening Ceremonies, showcasing Berluti\u2019s heritage techniques and craftsmanship on the world stage (see story).\n\nFrench fashion house Louis Vuitton constructed custom trunks for the competition's medalists and torchbearers (see story). The monogram canvas-covered boxes featuring brass fixtures were built to \u201cprotect, display and showcase\u201d Olympic and Paralympic prizes and props.\n\nLouis Vuitton constructed custom trunks to house the competition's medals and torches\n\nThe brand additionally enlisted a crew of French athletes, including professional rugby player Antoine Dupont and sprinter Timoth\u00e9e Adolphe, for brand ambassadorships. Swimmer L\u00e9on Marchand, gymnast M\u00e9lanie de Jesus dos Santos, fencer Enzo Lefort, cyclist Marie Patouillet and tennis player Pauline D\u00e9roul\u00e8de (see story) also signed with the maison.\n\n\u201cFollowing the unveiling of the Olympic and Paralympic medals designed by the Maison Chaumet, LVMH is once again fully expressing its role as premium partner of the Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024, and \u2018Artisan of all Victories,\u2019 this time with Louis Vuitton,\u201d said Antoine Arnault, head of image and environment at LVMH, in a statement.\n\n\u201cProtecting the symbol of Paris 2024 \u2013 the torches \u2013 and the dreams of the greatest athletes \u2013 the medals \u2013 required the expertise of exceptional craftsmen,\u201d Mr. Arnault said. \u201cLouis Vuitton has put its 170 years of expertise in trunks design at the service of Paris 2024, to protect and present the medals, and to take the torches around the country.\n\n\u201cIt is a great source of pride today to unveil these original creations, which I\u2019m sure will remain engraved in the history of the Group and the Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024!\u201d\n\nMo\u00ebt Hennessy division brands, including Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot and Ruinart, invited guests to their respective headquarters, restaurants, tasting cellars and bars. Special edition bottles of the maisons\u2019 cuv\u00e9es bearing the French flag were released ahead of the Games. A digital gallery compiling all Paris 2024 memorabilia was launched last summer (see story).\n\nData from cloud technology platform Launchmetrics ties $12.9 billion in Media Impact Value (MIV) to Paris 2024, adding that LVMH-owned entities, including French fashion houses Dior and Louis Vuitton, dominated conversation (see story).",

No further details of the deal have been released or confirmed.\n\nThe motive for L Catterton to snap up a stake in Kapital is unclear, however, it could be linked to the brand\u2019s existing relationship with LVMH, which in turn holds a majority stake in the investment firm.\n\nHirata and his son Kiro had previously been tapped by Kim Jones to collaborate for part of Louis Vuitton\u2019s spring/summer 2013 menswear collection. The brand, which will celebrate its 40th anniversary in 2026, has also found favour among celebrities like A$AP Rocky, who has previously been recognised by LVMH as a fashion pioneer.\n\nHowever, it is likely that L Catterton\u2019s interest in Kapital could also be tied into its plans to expand in Asia, for which last year it set out to establish three new regional investment vehicles, one with a particular focus on the Japanese market.

This drop of 31.9 billion dollars is primarily due to a nearly 40% drop in LVMH\u2019s stock, of which Arnault owns 48%.\n\nLVMH, the world leader in luxury, owns iconic brands such as Louis Vuitton, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, and TAG Heuer. However, in 2024, the company faced a drop in demand across several key markets, particularly in China and Europe. Several factors explain this decline: persistent inflation, a global economic slowdown, and changing consumer habits.\n\nThis stock market correction marks a turning point after a decade of exponential growth for LVMH, and highlights the increased volatility of luxury markets in the face of global economic shocks.\n\nA fortune that remains colossal despite the losses\n\nDespite this significant loss, Bernard Arnault maintains his position among the wealthiest people on the planet, now ranking sixth worldwide with an estimated wealth of 178 billion dollars.\n\nThis relatively comfortable situation reflects the strength of the LVMH empire, which continues to dominate the global luxury sector with prestigious brands like Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer, and Dom P\u00e9rignon.\n\nLong-term prospects remain promising for great fortunes, as highlighted in the Deloitte Private study. According to their projections, the wealth of ultra-rich families is expected to reach 9.5 trillion dollars by 2030, up from 5.5 trillion currently, suggesting that this difficult period could merely be a temporary correction in a long-term growth trajectory.\n\nThis market turbulence, while spectacular, does not undermine the fundamentals of the LVMH group nor Bernard Arnault\u2019s dominant position in the global luxury industry. It nonetheless highlights the necessity for major luxury groups to adapt to a rapidly changing economic environment.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

But interestingly, a person renting space in one of Ambani\u2019s properties is even wealthier than him! This individual is none other than Bernard Arnault, the CEO and Chairman of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH).\n\nWho Is Bernard Arnault? Bernard Arnault is a global icon in the luxury goods industry and consistently ranks among the top five richest people in the world. According to Forbes\u2019 latest report, Arnault and his family have a staggering net worth of $168.8 billion. This makes him far wealthier than Mukesh Ambani, whose net worth stands at $94.9 billion.\n\nArnault\u2019s business empire, LVMH, owns some of the world\u2019s most prestigious luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., Dior, Givenchy, TAG Heuer, and Bulgari.\n\nHow Did Arnault Become Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Tenant? Although Arnault isn\u2019t a direct tenant of Ambani, his flagship brand Louis Vuitton has leased a large retail space in the Jio World Plaza . This high-end mall, owned by Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Group, is located in Mumbai\u2019s posh Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC).\n\nLouis Vuitton occupies 7,465 square feet in the mall and pays a hefty monthly rent of Rs 40.5 lakh or $48,600, according to reports.\n\nJio World Plaza Jio World Plaza is rapidly emerging as a go-to destination for global luxury brands. Apart from Louis Vuitton, other top names under the LVMH group, and even unrelated brands, have opened stores here. For instance, Balenciaga, another internationally renowned luxury label, has launched its first store in India at this mall. Reports suggest Balenciaga is paying Rs 40 lakh or $48,000 in monthly rent for its space.\n\nWith a growing lineup of elite brands, Jio World Plaza is cementing its position as a luxury shopping hub in India, making it a prime location for companies like LVMH to expand their footprint in the country.",

            "content": "The U.S. Surgeon General warns: Drinking can give you cancer.\n\nBad news for imbibers, as well as for investors in companies that manufacture and distribute alcoholic beverages today: On Friday, the U.S. Surgeon General released an \"advisory\" statement on the relationship between alcohol and cancer, linking alcohol consumption to \"increasing risk for at least seven types of cancer.\"\n\nShares of Boston Beer (SAM 1.38%) stock are down 3.6% in response, as of 11:05 a.m. ET. Molson Coors (TAP 1.44%) and LVMH Moet Hennessy (LVMUY 1.41%) have fallen 2.2% and 2.8%, respectively.\n\nWhat the U.S. Surgeon General says about alcohol and cancer\n\nU.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy cites alcohol as a contributing factor to cancer of the breast, colorectum, esophagus, liver, mouth (oral cavity), throat (pharynx), and voice box (larynx), and notes that \"for breast cancer specifically, 16.4% of total breast cancer cases are attributable to alcohol consumption.\" He further argues that drinking even less than one alcoholic drink per day can increase cancer risk, and blames alcohol for 20,000 cancer deaths annually in the U.S.\n\nIn today's announcement, Dr. Murthy notes that scientific evidence of links between alcohol consumption and increased cancer risk has been known for decades, but \"less than half of Americans recognize [alcohol] as a risk factor for cancer.\"\n\nTo fix this, Dr. Murthy recommends (among other actions) placing warning labels on alcoholic beverages to highlight their cancer risk. He furthermore recommends putting these warning labels on all types of alcohol, naming beer (Boston Beer and Molson Coors), wine (Molson Coors and LVMH Moet Hennessy), and spirits (all three of these beverage stocks) as specific targets.\n\nWhat this means for alcohol stocks\n\nInvestors in alcoholic beverage stocks got the message loud and clear this morning: The Surgeon General wants to slap warning labels featuring the scary word \"cancer\" on the products their companies sell. That's certain to have at least some effect on sales. (Investors in tobacco stocks can tell you all about that). Investors are reacting appropriately to the news by selling off some alcohol stocks to reflect the heightened risk.\n\nAnd yet, this is only a risk -- not a certainty.\n\nJust because the U.S. Surgeon General recommends something, doesn't necessarily mean it will happen. By law, changing the warning labels on alcoholic beverages would require an act of Congress. Moreover, the present Surgeon General might be leaving his post in as little as 17 days, when President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\nIt's currently not known whether Trump's intended nominee for the post, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, will likewise want labels on alcohol to warn of cancer risk, but if she doesn't, there would seem little motivation for Congress to ratify the advice of an outgoing surgeon general who does.\n\nFinally and most obviously, surgeons general have been warning about the cancer risk from tobacco for decades, yet people still smoke cigarettes. Even in a worst-case scenario (for alcohol investors), I think it highly unlikely that putting a few cancer labels on alcoholic beverages will stop people buying alcohol.\n\nPerhaps the best reaction investors could have to today's mini-sell-off in alcohol stocks, therefore, might be to survey these stocks for potential bargains. Of the three alcoholic beverage stocks, I personally see the most value in Molson Coors, which at a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 13 and paying a 3% dividend, might actually end up being quite a healthy addition to your portfolio.",

Overall group net sales fell by 2% compared with the first nine months of 2023.\n\nCognac dip\n\nThe Moet Hennessy wines and spirits division turned in the weakest performance, with revenues falling by 11%, hit especially by slumping demand for Cognac in both China and the US where the company resorted to widespread discounting to shift stocks of the spirit.\n\nTowards the end of the year, Arnault announced a management reshuffle which saw former group chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony move to head Moet Hennessy and shake it up while his son Alexandre Arnault becomes deputy CEO, moving into wines and spirits after working at LVMH-owned jewellery brand Tiffany.\n\nCautious optimism\n\nAnalysts believe that the worst could be over for LVMH because stands to benefit from a revival in demand for luxury goods from the all-important Chinese market and also in the US where it outguns its rivals.\n\nOn the other hand, a threat of tariff sanctions continues to hover over Cognac from both Beijing and the incoming Trump Administration.\n\nDespite that, some analysts tip LVMH to chalk up organic sales growth of about 4% in 2025.\n\nCertainly, Arnault is backing the group \u2013 he has spent more than $100 million buying stock in the past two months.\n\nRelated news\n\nOntario liquor board denies tampering with Gretzky wine labels\n\nSenators fight to support smoke-affected vintners\n\nTrump\u2019s 200% tariff threat leaves wine world reeling",

            "content": "India\u2019s drinking culture has undergone a fascinating evolution over the past decade. From traditional whisky-heavy preferences to embracing nuanced choices like sparkling wines, single malts, and luxury tequilas, the Indian consumer is redefining what it means to enjoy a drink. Smriti Sekhsaria, Marketing Director at Mo\u00ebt Hennessy India, sits at the forefront of this transformation. With a portfolio that includes iconic names like Glenmorangie, Hennessy, and Chandon, Sekhsaria\u2019s perspective on India\u2019s shifting palate is as rich as the products she represents.\n\nIn this exclusive conversation with Business Today, Sekhsaria dives into the trends shaping India\u2019s drinking habits, the rise of experiential luxury, and the innovations Mo\u00ebt Hennessy is bringing to the table to cater to a rapidly evolving market.\n\nPD: How have you seen Indian drinking culture evolve over the past decade?\n\nSmriti Sekhsaria: The past 5\u201310 years have been transformative, but I think post-COVID offers a more specific benchmark for changes in consumption trends. We\u2019ve observed a clear evolution beyond whisky, with wine becoming a popular choice. Notably, Indian wines have made great strides in quality over the last decade.\n\nAnother noticeable shift is the trend of \u201cdrinking better but less.\u201d This spans across age groups, from younger drinkers in their mid-20s to more mature consumers in their 50s. There\u2019s a heightened awareness of occasions now - people are discerning about what they drink at brunches versus dinners, opting for lighter options like white wine or sparkling wine during the day and darker spirits in the evening. Chandon, our Indian sparkling wine, which was traditionally considered an evening drink, has now become a brunch favourite. For instance, it\u2019s often served in hotels during check-ins on weekends\u2014a trend we\u2019re delighted to see.\n\nPD: What role does consumer education play in shaping these evolving preferences?\n\nSmriti Sekhsaria: Digital platforms, especially during the pandemic, have played a pivotal role in educating consumers. People are far more aware now - they want to know about the origins of a product, its sustainability, and the craftsmanship behind it. This curiosity benefits brands like ours, as it allows us to engage deeply with consumers.\n\nFor example, Vulcan, our luxury tequila brand, resonates well with this trend. Consumers today ask about additive-free products, the heritage of the agave used, and the distillation methods. Similarly, our innovations with Chandon, such as ORVA\u2014a still red wine crafted from Shiraz grapes\u2014stem from our understanding of Indian tastes. Such initiatives reflect how consumer education is influencing product development.\n\nPD: India\u2019s love for single malts and limited editions seems to be growing. What\u2019s driving this trend?\n\nSmriti Sekhsaria: Single malts occupy a unique space in India. Whether it\u2019s a young software engineer in Bengaluru or an HNI in Ludhiana, whisky enthusiasts often showcase a wide range of over 30 whiskies in their home bars. It\u2019s no longer about sticking to one prestige whisky; consumers now enjoy curating and showcasing a repertoire.\n\nAdditionally, as global travel increases, Indians are seeking unique expressions and age statements. They\u2019re interested in everything from Indian single malts, which have gained international acclaim, to exotic varieties like Taiwanese and German whiskies. For us, innovation is key. For instance, Glenmorangie is transitioning its classic 10-year-old Original to a 12-year-old, catering to the growing demand for aged expressions. Another example is the Glenmorangie 23-year-old, co-created with a Japanese botanist, which highlights a beautiful fusion of floral, fruity, and oaky notes.\n\nPD: You\u2019ve mentioned \u201ccrafting experiences\u201d rather than just selling bottles. Could you elaborate on this strategy?\n\nSmriti Sekhsaria: At Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, we see ourselves as purveyors of luxury, with alcohol as the medium. This philosophy is deeply rooted in our connection to LVMH\u2019s legacy of creating unforgettable experiences. Our goal is to craft moments that go beyond consumption, creating memories that resonate.\n\nOne example is our collaboration with luxury designer duo Shivan & Narresh to create bespoke living room couches inspired by Glenmorangie. These couches celebrated the intimate setting in which premium whisky is often enjoyed\u2014with close friends and family. The campaign generated immense engagement, from PR buzz to consumer interest, elevating the brand\u2019s visibility.\n\nSimilarly, at our Nashik winery, we offer a boutique, pre-booked experience that showcases the beauty of India\u2019s wine culture. Guests enjoy the scenic foothills, sip on wines crafted by Kaushal Khairnar\u2014our winemaker and the youngest at LVMH\u2014and learn about the terroir of Nashik. This kind of storytelling creates an emotional connection with our products.\n\nPD: How do Indian alcohol consumers differ from their global counterparts?\n\nSmriti Sekhsaria: Indian consumers are still evolving in their understanding of drinking occasions. Globally, there\u2019s a clear sequence: starting with something light like a bubbly aperitif and transitioning to heavier spirits, ending with a cognac. In India, these distinctions are less defined, but they\u2019re emerging. For instance, the cocktail culture here is massive compared to the West, where simpler formats like highballs or sipping spirits are more common.\n\nInterestingly, India is quick to adopt global trends. Take tequila, for instance - it became a global phenomenon a few years ago, and we\u2019ve seen Indian consumers catch up swiftly, with luxury tequilas now gaining traction.\n\nPD: How was 2024 for Mo\u00ebt Hennessy India, and what are your expectations for 2025?\n\nSmriti Sekhsaria: 2024 was a year of peaks and troughs. While retail and off-trade channels showed strong growth, there were fluctuations earlier in the year. Premiumisation remains a key trend - consumers are upgrading to better age statements in whisky and exploring more diverse spirits like tequila and cognac.\n\nLooking ahead, I see innovation driving growth. Retail modernisation will continue to shape how consumers engage with our products, and airports will remain critical as hubs for discovery and experimentation. From curated travel retail offerings to exclusive launches, this channel will be instrumental in shaping the future.\n\nPD: Finally, on a personal note, what\u2019s your favourite drink from Mo\u00ebt Hennessy\u2019s portfolio?\n\nSmriti Sekhsaria: I have a few favourites! For day occasions, I love the Chandon Ros\u00e9 - its sparkling notes are light and refreshing. For evenings, Hennessy XO on the rocks is my go-to. And recently, I\u2019ve been enjoying a savoury cocktail made with Volcan Blanco tequila, featuring pickle brine, dill, and citrus. It\u2019s called \u201cPickle Me Delicious,\u201d and it\u2019s as unique as it sounds!",

Ever since Bot\u00edn took the helm in 2014, Santander has welcomed 60 million new customers, tripled its profits, and boosted shareholder returns sixfold. Last year, the bank reported a record \u20ac11.1 billion in profit, setting the stage for an even stronger 2024.\n\nWhile much of 2024\u2019s business chatter has centered on AI, the biggest wins are still coming from digitizing traditional industries.\n\nMeanwhile, Arnault has widened his gaze this year with AI investments through the venture fund owned by the family office, Agla\u00e9 Ventures, and by foraying into entertainment and sports.\n\nWhile the luxury boss has no retirement plans on the horizon, his children have been elevated to key positions this year. Two of his sons, Alexandre and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, joined their two siblings on LVMH\u2019s board in April, and Alexandre was also made a key figure at the conglomerate\u2019s wine and spirits division, Mo\u00ebt Hennessy.\n\nThe LVMH CEO has been pulled into an influence-peddling investigation involving the former head of France\u2019s domestic intelligence agency. Arnault denied any involvement.\n\nA pullback in Chinese consumer demand and changing attitudes toward luxury goods have hurt LVMH\u2014and Arnault himself. He\u2019s lost $32 billion in wealth this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making him the only billionaire among the world\u2019s top 15 wealthiest individuals to close the year with a lower net worth. Arnault remains Europe\u2019s richest man, nonetheless.\n\nBernard Arnault is the commander-in-chief of the world\u2019s largest luxury conglomerate, LVMH. He\u2019s led the company through decades of ups and downs, including the recent luxury downturn.\n\nOne thing is clear: Without these figures, neither the year nor Europe itself would look the same.\n\nWhether in automotive, luxury, or regulation, these individuals represent Europe\u2019s ever-evolving role in the global economy.

Plus, their presence portends the year to come.\n\nYet none of those metaphors alter the fact that it remains a key arena for Big Business, boasting a market of roughly 500 million people. And it\u2019s the industry leaders in this region who keep Europe at the center of global debates, both big and small.\n\nEurope has attracted many metaphors this year, from a collapsing souffl\u00e9 to a soon-to-be \u201c museum \u201d with no industry left.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBot\u00edn\u2019s success lies in her ambitious decade-long push to modernize and streamline this 167-year-old global banking titan.

He marked this milestone by sailing across the Mediterranean Sea with 10 others: his family, legal team, and key figures from Autonomy, the business he sold to Hewlett-Packard in a widely criticized deal that led to a 13-year-long court battle.\n\nTragically, his life, along with those of six others on board, was cut short when the Bayesian superyacht sank on Aug. 19, 2024. The tragedy became a global news story, with conspiracy theories surrounding the once \u201cunsinkable\u201d superyacht and rumors of classified information on board that was lost forever.\n\nThe saga lives on today. Lynch may have won the court battles in San Francisco, but he lost in the U.K. civil case, which expects to rule on damages in 2025. Despite the sensitive nature of Lynch\u2019s downfall, Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced it plans to pursue his family for up to $4 billion in damages.\n\nCarlos Tavares, former CEO, Stellantis\n\nCarlos Tavares, chief executive officer of Stellantis NV, during a Bloomberg Television interview at the Paris Motor Show in Paris, France, on Monday, Oct. 14, 2024. \"We are finally to starting to see smaller vehicles and more affordable EVs,\" said Serge Gachot, director of the Paris show. Photographer: Nathan Laine/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nCarlos Tavares was the sacrificial lamb in a bloodbath year for European automakers.\n\nThe then Stellantis CEO resigned in December, ahead of a planned 2026 retirement, after struggling to turn around the fortunes of a carmaker that had shed market share in its key markets; Tavares\u2019s approach to salvaging the auto giant had clashed with the views of Stellantis\u2019s board.\n\nThis Christmas will mark Tavares\u2019s first out of the spotlight, after the 66-year-old turned around the fortunes of France\u2019s PSA Group before taking the helm at Stellantis after a merger with Fiat Chrysler.\n\nTavares, who described himself as arrogant earlier this year in failing to react to manufacturing and inventory issues, was criticized by dealers in the U.S., where Stellantis sells the widely popular Jeep and Ram brands.\n\nHis legacy was also widely trashed by executives, who spoke off the record to several publications, alleging Tavares was focused on preserving his own reputation ahead of Stellantis\u2019s long-term interests.\n\nTavares was described as a \u201csamurai\u201d by a former French finance minister. He is also a devoted self-described petrol head, who was often found at racetracks testing out vintage cars on his weekends off.\n\nHe drew criticism during his rise for his focus on cost-cutting, which was known to hurt morale among his employees. Until now, though, the results on the balance sheet always protected the outspoken CEO, who had a fascination with Darwinism.\n\nWith Stellantis, however, it appears Tavares finally tipped the scales to the point where his position was no longer tenable.\n\nTavares\u2019s first interview since his resignation, in which he said he wouldn\u2019t act differently with hindsight, was emblematic of that laser-focused approach that proved crucial to both his rise and his downfall.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, former executive vice president of the European Commission and commissioner for competition\n\nBRUSSELS, BELGIUM - SEPTEMBER 10: Executive Vice President of the European Commission for A Europe Fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager is talking to media in the Berlaymont, the EU Commission headquarter on September 10, 2024 in Brussels, Belgium. Today the EU Court of Justice ruled in favor of the European Commission which had ordered Apple to reimburse 13 billion euros in unpaid taxes to Ireland in 2016, and 2.4 billion euros imposed on Google for the anti-competitive promotion of its Shopping service. The judgment puts an end to the dispute. (Photo by Thierry Monasse/Getty Images)\n\nEurope has become synonymous with regulation in tech circles\u2014for better or worse\u2014and Margrethe Vestager has been instrumental. The \u201ctax lady,\u201d as Donald Trump named her, has helped legal tools like the Digital Markets Act and the AI Act come to fruition. She also hasn\u2019t pulled her punches when calling out the largest companies in the world for being anticompetitive\u2014sometimes with just a one-minute Instagram video and a marker board.\n\nHer unrelenting pursuit in bringing Big Tech to pay its dues and conform to rules on its influence reached a pinnacle in 2024. The EU issued Apple and Google a cumulative \u20ac15.4 billion in back taxes and fines, respectively\u2014a landmark moment in Vestager\u2019s 10-year crusade as the bloc\u2019s competition chief.\n\nVestager told reporters that she hoped the Google case against it favoring its shopping search results would be a \u201ccatalyst for change.\u201d The Dane\u2019s time at the EU has attracted its fair share of criticism as impeding the region\u2019s attractiveness for tech. However, every big company will have to contend with a higher standard of business practices, thanks to Vestager\u2019s legacy.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, the U.S. took oversight of the tech industry a lot more seriously, sending a strong message to the sprawling behemoths that have long operated with little restraint. It remains to be seen how Trump tussles with the precedent Vestager set.\n\nAs she ends her term policing antitrust, Vestager will take over as chair of the Technical University of Denmark\u2019s board in 2025.\n\nSharon White, former chairman, John Lewis Partnership\n\nDame Sharon White\u2019s tenure as chairman of the John Lewis Partnership was marked by decisive and often divisive actions aimed at turning around the iconic British retailer after a period of unprecedented challenges.\n\nAssuming leadership of the retail giant in 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic, White navigated through significant disruptions and then embarked on a difficult yet necessary strategy of adapting John Lewis to the modern retail landscape.\n\nClosing underperforming stores, reducing staff bonuses, and briefly removing the stores\u2019 iconic price promise were all measures designed to streamline operations and reduce costs. White also spearheaded the diversification of the business into new markets like residential property.\n\nDespite facing criticism for her lack of prior retail experience, White\u2019s leadership was instrumental in steering the partnership toward financial recovery. By 2024, JLP reported a return to profitability, with improving market share and customer satisfaction, signaling the initial success of the transformation initiatives she set in motion.\n\nWhite\u2019s tenure, while challenging, exemplifies the best kind of adaptive leadership in the face of adversity, laying the groundwork for John Lewis Partnership\u2019s ongoing transformation and reaffirming her status as one of the top business personalities of 2024.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

However, Milan prosecutors found the company \u201cde facto non-existent\u201d during a police inspection in 2024, triggering legal action against Manufactures Dior, Dior\u2019s Italian production arm.\n\nThe case has placed Dior under judicial oversight since June 2024 and raised questions about the effectiveness of LVMH\u2019s supply chain monitoring.\n\nDior\u2019s July statement condemned illegal practices within its supply chain and acknowledged the need to improve its inspection processes.

Investigations into Italy\u2019s artisanal sector have implicated other high-end brands like Giorgio Armani and Alviero Martini, highlighting systemic oversight failures.\n\nExperts note that subcontractors often evade detection by preparing for planned audits, coaching workers, and resuming exploitative practices outside inspection hours.\n\nItaly, responsible for over 50% of global luxury leather and clothing production, remains central to the industry\u2019s supply chain challenges. Industry insiders say brands prioritize cost-cutting measures over thorough compliance checks, enabling such exploitation.\n\nDespite legal requirements, luxury groups are not obligated to audit subcontractors, where most violations occur.\n\nLVMH, valued at $330 billion, faces increasing pressure from investors to enhance supply chain transparency and align practices with its public commitments to sustainability and corporate responsibility. In its 2023 Social and Environmental Responsibility Report, the group stated it aims to uphold human rights and ensure safe working conditions in its supply chains.\n\nItaly\u2019s antitrust authority is investigating whether Dior and Armani misled consumers about their supply chain practices. While Armani has expressed confidence in a favorable outcome, LVMH has yet to publicly address the broader allegations.\n\nProsecutors argue that the luxury conglomerate\u2019s reliance on inadequate checks fuels systemic labour exploitation, risking its reputation and exposing it to potential civil liability.",

            "content": "LVMH-owned Dior's production arm in Italy, Manufactures Dior, relied on formal inspections to assess working and safety standards inside its supply chain last year. In some cases, such certifications missed glaring problems, a Reuters review of unpublished court documents has found.\n\nAZ Operations, a sub-contractor of Manufactures Dior tasked with the production of leather items and based near Italy's fashion capital Milan, was accused by Italian prosecutors in June of being a front for an operation that exploited workers.\n\nHowever, AZ Operations passed two environmental and social inspections in 2023, in January and July, according to unpublished audit documents reviewed by Reuters. Widespread Milan investigations have uncovered malpractice inside the Italian luxury goods supply chain of Dior, Giorgio Armani and Alviero Martini this year, Reuters has previously reported.\n\nThe audit papers, along with court documents, Reuters interviews with more than two dozen luxury sector workers, auditors, supply chain managers, suppliers, lawyers, industry experts, executives and trade union representatives reveal the pervasiveness of ineffective checks of social and environmental standards inside Italy's sprawling luxury supply chain.\n\nIn the case of AZ Operations, a three-page assessment on letterhead from compliance management company Fair Factories Clearinghouse (FFC), carried out by monitor Adamo Adriano on January 18, 2023, stated that AZ Operations did not have sub-contractors. The audit listed no irregularities.\n\nIn July 2023, a further audit by Davide Albertario Milano srl, a large direct supplier of Manufactures Dior that worked with AZ Operations, also found \u201cno non-conformities\u201d and certified the work was carried out to a high standard and in accordance with contractual terms.\n\nDespite passing the audits, a police investigation into its 2023 activities found AZ Operations was \u201cde facto non-existent\u201d, according to Milan court documents. Furthermore, police inspections in April 2024 alleged the company was a front for a separate business, New Leather Italy, that exploited undocumented workers in sweatshop-like conditions, the same documents showed. That discovery was one of the factors that prompted Milan's prosecutors to put Manufactures Dior under court administration in June.\n\nDior and LVMH did not respond to multiple requests for comment about Reuters' findings, including the audits, and on the process to inspect external manufacturers in Italy.\n\nIn a July statement following revelations from the Milan prosecutors' inquiries, Dior said it firmly condemned illegal practices discovered at two of its contractors, saying such unworthy acts contradicted \u201cits values and the code of conduct signed by these suppliers\u201d.\n\n\u201cAware of the gravity of the violations committed by these suppliers and the improvements to be made to its checks and procedures, the house of Dior is collaborating with the designated Italian administrator and the Italian authorities,\u201d the French brand also said at the time.\n\nDior added in the statement that its teams were working intensely to reinforce the existing procedures: \u201cDespite regular audits, these two suppliers had evidently succeeded in hiding these practices.\u201d\n\nFFC-owner Worldly responded to Reuters queries saying it had never offered facility auditing services to Worldly or FFC users, adding it asks that customers enlist external verifiers to ensure impartial, transparent audits. \u201cRegarding the letterhead in the court documents, this is a template available to customers within the FFC platform,\u201d Worldly added in its statement.\n\nAdamo Adriano did not respond to Reuters attempts to reach them. Davide Albertario did not respond to queries by Reuters on inspections at AZ Operations. New Leather Italy did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.\n\n\u201cCost-reduction\u201d\n\nGlobal luxury groups including LVMH usually outsource most of their production to a myriad of external contractors, industry experts say.\n\nMany are based in Italy, famed for its artisanal skills and accounting for between 50 per cent and 55 per cent of the global production of luxury clothing and leather goods, consultancy Bain calculates.\n\n\u201cNo matter how many controls we do, there is always something we miss,\u201d Renzo Rosso, founder of Italian fashion group OTB, which makes Diesel clothing, told a business event in September, in reference to the complexity of overseeing Italy's supply chain.\n\nDespite the risks, insiders and experts told Reuters relying on suppliers is a deliberate strategy to keep costs down and manage demand.\n\n\u201cThe fashion business model is driven by cost-reduction tactics, leading fashion brands to switch suppliers,\u201d said Hakan Karaosman, Associate Professor at Cardiff University, whose research focuses on supply chain sustainability.\n\nEven though Dior did not directly abuse workers, the mechanism of labour exploitation \u201cwas culpably fuelled by Manufactures Dior srl which... did not carry out effective inspections or audits over the years to ascertain the actual working conditions and environment,\u201d Milan prosecutors said in the June court documents.\n\nCurrently, there is no firm legal requirement in Italy for luxury groups to audit their suppliers. But poor oversight can clash with sustainability claims made to investors and consumers over craftsmanship and corporate and social responsibility standards, leading to reputational risks and in some cases civil liability if workers' exploitation is found within the supply chain.\n\nLVMH, for example, said in its 2023 Social and Environmental Responsibility Report it \u201cendeavors to ensure its suppliers and their service providers uphold human rights and to support them with applying the best possible employment, health and safety conditions.\u201d The investigations into Italy's luxury supply chain have prompted some LVMH shareholders to ask the $330-billion behemoth, owned by French billionaire Bernard Arnault, to better monitor how its contractors treat workers.\n\nLVMH told a group of investors in November it was auditing all of its direct suppliers and immediate contractors. In a subsequent statement to Reuters in November, LVMH said it had conducted more than 2,600 on-site audits globally this year. Italy's antitrust authority said in July it was investigating whether Dior and Armani have misled consumers.\n\nIn July, Armani expressed confidence in a \u201cpositive result following the (antitrust) investigation\u201d, saying in a statement that its companies were fully committed to cooperating with the authorities and that it believed the allegations had no merit.\n\nSkin-deep oversight\n\nBrands dictate the depth of the checks and the auditors' scope of action and inspections are often limited to direct suppliers and not to sub-contractors, where the biggest problems usually lie, four auditors and luxury goods supply chain managers Reuters spoke to said.\n\nAudits tend to be planned in advance, allowing suppliers to paint a better picture by, for instance, clearing premises of workers without proper contracts, these people said.\n\nOn May 9, 2023, for example, external auditor Adamo Adriano sent Pelletterie Elisabetta Yang, another supplier of Manufactures Dior based near Milan, a written notice flagging that he would hold an inspection on 26 May, 2023, the audit documents reviewed by Reuters show.\n\nIn the notice, Adriano asked to analyse employment contracts, organisational charts, pay slips and a dozen more documents.\n\nThe check-up did take place, but it was \u201cmore formal than substantial,\u201d investigators wrote of the audit. The assessment listed no irregularities.\n\nIn March 2024, police entered Elisabetta Yang's workshop, which housed also a refectory and several bedrooms. They found 23 workers, five of which were irregular. The workers lived and worked \u201cin hygiene and health conditions that are below the minimum required,\u201d the court documents read.\n\nAdriano did not reply to Reuters requests to comment with regards to the audit of Elisabetta Yang. Reuters was not able to contact Elisabetta Yang at the official email addresses cited by the local chamber of commerce.\n\nAs private actors, auditors cannot freely access factories or workshops outside agreed hours and may not collect documents that are not spontaneously submitted by suppliers, two Italy-based luxury supply chain auditors told Reuters.\n\nThe time allocated for on-site inspections is often too short to examine documents and interview employees, these people said.\n\nFive Tuscany-based luxury chain workers employed at separate workshops serving major brands confirmed to Reuters workshop owners knew in advance of the audits and would clear their premises and prep staff on what answers to give monitoring teams on the day of an inspection.\n\nAll declined to be named for fear of losing their job.\n\n\u201cWe used to say we only worked four hours a day, as per our (formal) part-time contract,\u201d said Pakistani-born Abbas, who works in the leathermaking hub of Prato.\n\n\u201cBut how could they think we were making 1,300 bags a day with 50 workers employed only four hours a day?\u201d, Abbas, who said he worked 14 hours a day, six days a week, added.\n\nOn the day of the audit, employees with part-time contracts were asked to leave as soon as they finished their formal shift, but had to come back and continue work after the auditors left, he added.\n\nAnother worker, also from Pakistan and employed at a separate leather workshop in the Florence area, said factory owners warned workers when the inspection would take place and asked them to lie about their working hours. Fabio Roia, President of the Court of Milan, told Reuters that companies don't invest enough in their control systems and don't normally question the extremely cheap prices contractors offer to provide goods or services. Small fashion brand Alviero Martini, famed for leather bags decorated with geographical map patterns, was also targeted by the Italian inquiries for allegedly sub-contracting work to Chinese-owned firms in Italy that mistreated workers. The Alviero Martini group was \u201ccareful in selecting direct suppliers ... but the use of sub-suppliers was not actually checked properly,\u201d Ilaria Ramoni, who served as court administrator overseeing its operations until October, said in an interview.\n\nThe group, which is no longer under court administration, did not respond to a request for comment. It stated in September it was unaware of the illegal behaviour occurring within its supply chain.\n\nDior and Armani are still under special judicial oversight as part of the Milan's investigation into labour exploitation.",

            "content": "French stock indices like the CAC 40 have suffered this year, dragged down by a slow down in the luxury sector, as well as increasing fears about France\u2019s political stability.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrench stocks could potentially be on track to experience their worst yearly performance since the global financial crisis of 2007-2008.\n\nThis has mainly been exacerbated by increased investor anxieties about the political situation of the country, along with the possibility of tariffs, in case the EU-China trade war heats up, or tensions between the EU and the US worsen.\n\nThe ongoing cost of living crisis seen in many parts of Europe, as well as France, along with high interest rates and soaring inflation has also contributed to the French economy seeing relatively subdued growth compared to some of its European counterparts.\n\nThis has gone a long way in discouraging both domestic and foreign investors from investing in French stocks. A rising budget deficit and the snap elections seen earlier this year have also contributed to this.\n\nThe CAC 40 index has already fallen 3% year-to-date, although it did gain 2.78% this month, as well as 1.25% in the past week.\n\nIn comparison, other major European indexes such as the Stoxx 50 surged 7.96% year-to-date, while the Stoxx 600 index jumped 5.42% so far this year. The German DAX index has also grown 18.46% year-to-date.\n\nWhy have French stocks struggled so much this year?\n\nOne of the major reasons for the CAC 40\u2019s lacklustre performance is because of the global luxury sector struggling for the majority of 2024, following short-lived gains at the beginning of the year.\n\nSince luxury companies form a large part of the CAC 40, this sluggish performance has significantly impacted the index, especially through companies such as LVMH and Kering.\n\nLVMH has fallen 13.83% this year, whereas Kering plunged 45.90%. However, another major French company, Herm\u00e8s, has bucked this trend by advancing 20.42% year-to-date.\n\nFalling interest from vital markets such as China have also strongly affected these luxury companies. This is especially after the boom in demand seen during the pandemic for luxury goods such as designer accessories and premium alcohol.\n\nChinese customers are now pulling back on spending, following increasing fears of a deep economic turndown. Although the Chinese government has already revealed upcoming stimulus plans to boost market and economic confidence, it can take quite a while for these measures to be reflected in consumer prices, demand and activity.\n\nFrench auto companies such as Stellantis and Renault have also faced increased competition this year from Chinese automakers, especially electric vehicle (EV) makers such as SAIC, Geely and BYD.\n\nAlthough the EU has tried to curb this by imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs imported into the bloc, several of these manufacturers have now turned to hybrid vehicles, which are not currently covered under the existing tariffs, and may continue to provide stiff competition to domestic French and European automakers.\n\nThese tariffs by the EU have also led to some retaliation from the Chinese government, in the form of anti-dumping probes into EU brandy, which has especially hit French brandy manufacturers such as R\u00e9my Martin and Hennessy.",

            "content": "Business\n\nDec 31, 2024 | By Avery Booker\n\nThe year 2024 presented an inflection point for China\u2019s luxury market as economic pressures, shifting consumer behaviors, and growing arbitrage dynamics highlighted structural weaknesses in what was once the most promising growth engine for global luxury brands. The slowdown was underscored by a weakened economy, a persistent real estate crisis, and a discerning younger generation exercising restraint in discretionary spending.\n\nChina\u2019s economic growth decelerated to 4.5 percent this year, down from 5.2 percent in 2023, reflecting broader macroeconomic uncertainty. The property sector, which contributes approximately 30 percent of China\u2019s GDP, saw a 15 percent drop in investment. This contraction resulted in a negative wealth effect, eroding discretionary income among affluent households and leading to a significant shift in purchasing behavior.\n\nMainland sales of personal luxury goods dropped by 1 to 3 percent in the first quarter of the year, according to Bain-Altagamma\u2019s Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study. Analysts at HSBC revised their luxury market growth forecast downward, predicting just 2.8 percent growth in 2024, compared to their earlier estimate of 5.5 percent.\n\nPrice sensitivity among Chinese consumers drove a resurgence in outbound shopping, as favorable exchange rates and tax-free opportunities in destinations like Japan and Hainan made luxury purchases significantly cheaper. Japan\u2019s weak yen reduced prices for luxury goods by 30 to 40 percent, attracting a steady stream of Chinese shoppers.\n\nMeanwhile, Hainan\u2019s duty-free market reported a 15 percent YoY growth in sales, benefiting from its competitive pricing and accessibility. Approximately 52 percent of affluent Chinese consumers made overseas luxury purchases in the first half of 2024, up 16 percent from the previous year, despite outbound travel levels still recovering to pre-pandemic norms.\n\nLuxury pricing strategies added to the pressures, with repeated price hikes of 15-50 percent since 2021 alienating aspirational consumers. Outrage over price discrepancies with international markets gained traction on social media, further encouraging Chinese shoppers to shift their purchases abroad.\n\nLuxury price hikes in China: Strategic or risky?\n\nLuxury brands have implemented significant price increases in China and globally this year, as part of a strategy to fight inflation, maintain brand value, and maximize profits. Will consumer demand stay strong?\n\nAt the same time, structural economic challenges disproportionately impacted China\u2019s youth, traditionally a key driver of luxury spending. Youth unemployment exceeded 20 percent in 2024, a record high, and surveys revealed a corresponding decline in discretionary spending among those aged 16 to 24. This demographic is increasingly prioritizing travel, entertainment, and wellness experiences over material goods. Still, secondhand luxury platforms maintained momentum, with revenue growing around 20 percent this year as younger consumers embraced more affordable and sustainable options.\n\nWestern luxury brands faced mounting challenges amid these trends. TD Securities\u2019 consumer survey revealed that one in four Chinese shoppers found Western brands less appealing in 2024, underscoring the growing influence of domestic competitors.\n\nMao Geping Cosmetics, for example, achieved a market valuation exceeding USD 3 billion after an 87 percent share price surge at its IPO this year, reflecting strong demand for culturally resonant luxury alternatives. In contrast, luxury houses like LVMH and Richemont reported lower sales in the region, with LVMH\u2019s third-quarter revenue in Asia (excluding Japan) dropping 16 percent compared to 2023 levels.\n\nThe changing tastes of China\u2019s younger generations further reshaped the luxury landscape. Millennials and Gen Z gravitated toward brands with cultural relevance, authenticity, and sustainability while rejecting overt displays of wealth. This shift in consumer behavior aligns with Xi Jinping\u2019s ongoing campaign against \u201cluxury shame,\u201d which discourages ostentatious consumption and curbs the prominence of wealth influencers on social media.\n\nThe outlook for China\u2019s luxury market remains uncertain. Bain forecasts continued sluggishness through 2024, with structural issues such as weak consumer confidence, a pressured middle class, and rising economic inequality curbing growth. Brands hoping to recover must prioritize localized offerings, pricing stability, and deeper engagement with culturally conscious, value-driven consumers.\n\nBy the end of 2024, the lesson for global luxury brands is clear: Unchecked growth is no longer guaranteed, and the ability to adapt will determine success in China\u2019s evolving market.\n\nThis article was first seen on the Jing Daily by Head of Data Avery Booker.\n\nFor more on the latest in business reads, click here.",

We saw the watch calendar\u2019s biggest fairs grow and return, while auctions expanded in diversity of pieces, theming and, of course, results. Celebrity collectors like John Mayer and Kevin Hart evolved their public tastes and brand involvement, while others made their entry into the arena \u2013 Mark Zuckerberg is now known for sporting a new grail piece at almost every appearance he makes.\n\nOf course, watchmakers and brands across the board made waves and released ever bolder pieces. We had not one but two watches vie for the record of thinnest watch in the world. We saw Patek Philippe resurface with its first new collection in 25 years. And there was a changing of the guard for top brass at LVMH and Richemont, whilst brands partnered even more heavily with independent watchmakers and even clockmakers.

Hublot\u2019s sci-fi-esque MP-10 Tourbillon departs heavily from the brand\u2019s usual sports watches, while Bulgari gave us the malachite-dialled Lucea alongside the Bulgari Bulgari, evoking the 1970s. LVMH also presented an updated Daniel Roth Tourbillon Souscription in a bid to relaunch one of the most celebrated names in high horology.\n\n2.

In July, Julien Tornare (above left), who succeeded Arnault as Tag Heuer CEO in January, took over as the CEO of Hublot in September, replacing Ricardo Guadalupe (above right). Citing a desire to \u201cstep back from operational management\u201d, Guadalupe was appointed honorary president, per a release. Tornare was succeeded by former Bulgari general manager Antoine Pin as Tag Heuer CEO.\n\n3.

This time, instead of adding an exclusive fashion house or jewelry brand to its portfolio, the multinational purchased a stunning \u20ac46.5 million villa in Cannes.\n\nThe magnificent property is poised to serve as a hub for high-end events and experiential branding\u2014a fitting purpose for such an acquisition. Luxury brands often collaborate with companies like Experience The French Riviera to secure premium rental properties for events ranging from fashion shows and charity galas to exclusive dinners for their most valued clients.\n\n\n\nLVMH, the French luxury conglomerate, has purchased Villa Bagatelle, a historic property in Cannes, for around \u20ac46.5 million, Bloomberg reports. The sale, reportedly finalized in April, was facilitated by Magrey & Sons, one of our trusted partners.\n\nBuilt in 1928, Villa Bagatelle is a masterpiece of Art Deco design, featuring 12 bedrooms, three swimming pools\u2014two outdoor and one indoor\u2014and sprawling terraced gardens with breathtaking views of the Mediterranean. LVMH, the luxury powerhouse behind brands like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, and Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, plans to use the property to host exclusive events during Cannes\u2019 flagship festivals, such as Cannes Lions and the iconic Film Festival.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the villa will be available for rental during the summer, when the French Riviera attracts affluent global travelers.\n\nCannes offers an unparalleled setting for high-profile marketing opportunities thanks to its reputation for hosting sophisticated, large-scale events. The city\u2019s prestigious neighborhoods, including La Californie and Super Cannes, are renowned for their mix of modern and Belle-\u00c9poque properties, solidifying Cannes as a hotspot for luxury real estate.\n\nLVMH\u2019s acquisition underscores a growing trend among luxury and fashion brands to invest in real estate for experiential marketing. In 2023 alone, the company spent \u20ac2.45 billion on global real estate acquisitions, focusing primarily on retail spaces but also expanding into premium residential and hospitality properties. Other companies involved in the tech and pharmaceutical world have also been investing in luxury real estate since the Covid19 restrictions were lifted.\n\nThis move also aligns with LVMH\u2019s broader foray into entertainment, announced earlier this year, which aims to amplify brand visibility through premium film, television, and audio production initiatives.\n\nShare",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A big rally in defense stocks, deal-fueled gains in banks and a surge in Siemens Energy AG shares were among the main highlights for European stocks in 2024, a year that again saw the region struggle to keep pace with the US.\n\nMany of Europe\u2019s biggest names were stuck in the doldrums, including luxury bellwether LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA and foodmaker Nestle SA, whose shares are set for their biggest annual drop on record. Like LVMH, automakers such as Stellantis NV were weighed down by China worries, while obesity-drug hype started to fade, evidenced by Novo Nordisk A/S surrendering a more than 40% gain in the first half of the year.\n\n\u201cEuropean equities are pricing quite a lot of bad news,\u201d said Aliki Rouffiac, sustainable portfolio manager at Robeco. \u201cWe see, under our base case scenario, some valuation potential to be unlocked in 2025.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the biggest winners and losers of 2024:\n\nSiemens Energy Stars\n\nSiemens Energy AG\u2019s 317% surge eclipsed all other Stoxx Europe 600 members, its gains even surpassing Nvidia Corp. in dollar terms. The German renewable-energy giant saw growth in its grid technologies division offset weakness in its wind turbine business, leaving rivals Iberdrola SA and Enel SpA in the dust, from a stock-market perspective.\n\nLuxury Laggards\n\nIt was a rough year for luxury stocks. The market value of LVMH \u2014 not long ago the largest company in Europe \u2014 slid by about \u20ac50 billion ($52 billion) as concern around lower Chinese demand intensified.\n\nAnd Gucci-owner Kering SA hit its lowest level since 2017 as its sales outlook disappointed investors again. \u201cThe work to support the brand\u2019s comeback is still in progress, with little signs so far of an imminent positive inflection,\u201d JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Chiara Battistini said in a note.\n\nDefense Support\n\nThe conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East supported defense stocks, while Donald Trump\u2019s US election victory signaled potential pressure on NATO member states to increase their spending. Norwegian firm Kongsberg Gruppen ASA was up about 178% for the year, while Germany\u2019s Rheinmetall AG also saw triple-digit gains.\n\nHowever, BAE Systems trimmed its rally in the final two months of the year, with Bank of America Corp. analysts downgrading the British defense-equipment manufacturer due to the risk of potential US government spending cuts overseen by Elon Musk.\n\nBanking Boost\n\nBanking was Europe\u2019s best-performing sector this year, with the Stoxx subindex rising 25%, powered by higher interest rates that are fueling shareholder returns. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA led the rally, more than doubling as the Italian lender resumed dividend payments after 13 years and as domestic rival Banco BPM SpA took a stake as part of a government privatization.\n\nDeals also provided fuel for gains. UniCredit SpA began a pursuit of Commerzbank AG, while Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA made a hostile takeover offer for smaller Spanish rival Banco Sabadell SA.\n\n\u201cEverything that could go right went right for banks,\u201d said Marija Veitmane, head of equity strategy at State Street Global Markets.\n\nStellantis Leads Auto Losses\n\nThe autos sector was hurt by the growing strength of Chinese competitors like BYD Company Ltd while US president-elect Trump touted his tariff-centric economic plan post-election, compounding the sector\u2019s woes. The Stoxx auto index is down 12% year-to-date versus the broader benchmark\u2019s 5.9% gain.\n\nStellantis NV was the sector\u2019s biggest faller, dropping 40% amid a plunge in US sales and the departure of both Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares and Chief Financial Officer Natalie Knight within a few months.\n\nNovo Bubble Worries\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S faced some year-end volatility as data from its experimental obesity drug disappointed. Patients on CagriSema lost an average of 20.4% of their body weight over 68 weeks in a study, less than the 25% that the company had predicted. The stock cratered a record 29% within the first hour of the news and has since partially recovered.\n\n\u201cThe Novo obesity bubble has well and truly burst,\u201d Intron Health analyst Naresh Chouhan said in a note to clients. The shares are now down 8.9% year-to-date.\n\nUCB\u2019s Blockbuster Potential\n\nWeight-loss medicines weren\u2019t the only drugs catching investor attention. Belgian biotech company UCB SA\u2019s shares have more than doubled in 2024, largely reflecting optimism around the blockbuster potential of the skin disease treatment Bimzelx.\n\nThe rally also fueled gains in Financiere de Tubize SA, a listed investment vehicle for the family of Emmanuel Janssen, who founded UCB as a Belgian chemical producer almost 100 years ago.\n\n--With assistance from Jonas Ekblom, Lisa Pham, Kit Rees and Bre Bradham.\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "The global apparel industry, worth a staggering 1.79 trillion dollars, stands as one of the most vibrant and fiercely competitive sectors in the global economy. In 2024, the landscape has been shaped by a fascinating interplay of luxury powerhouses, fast fashion trailblazers, and athleisure innovators, each rewriting the rules of success. But what defines a brand\u2019s dominance in such a multifaceted industry? Is it market capitalization, revenue, brand value, or the ever-growing influence of social media?\n\nThis article takes a closer look at the year\u2019s standout performers through these critical lenses to uncover the trends and strategies driving their success.\n\nLuxury dominates market capitalization\n\nIn 2024, luxury fashion solidified its supremacy, with industry titans LVMH, Herm\u00e8s, and Dior leading the charge. LVMH, the unrivaled global leader, achieved a breathtaking market capitalization of 321.6 billion dollars, according to FashionUnited Combined Top 200 Index, which gathers the largest fashion companies in the world by market value. Boosted by the brand Louis Vuitton, LVMH\u2019s market capitalization alone would represent 21.7% of the combined market cap of the top 112 apparel companies, reports Uniform Market. But is such dominance of the market cap game truly surprising for a powerhouse that owns 75 brands, including 16 iconic fashion and leather goods maisons\u2014a portfolio that defines the very essence of luxury? Herm\u00e8s followed as a close contender with a valuation of 240.7 billion dollars, driven by a remarkable 15% growth fueled by its iconic leather goods and ready-to-wear collections. Inditex, the parent company of Zara, completes the top three, underscoring the enduring appeal and adaptability of luxury and fast fashion giants alike.\n\nWhy have these luxury brands thrived?\n\nDifferentiation and timeless appeal\n\nThe luxury sector\u2019s post-pandemic recovery, further complicated by fluctuating demand in the Chinese market, has been uneven, with the greatest successes reserved for brands capable of achieving significant differentiation across diverse categories while reassuring buyers of the enduring value of their investments. And this concept of \u2018value\u2019, as further explored in this article, is assuredly critical.\n\nIconic luxury players like Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e8s, and Chanel excel at blending innovation with timeless appeal. These brands offer not just products but experiences that resonate with both traditional luxury values and contemporary consumer expectations. This strategy is particularly important in today\u2019s volatile economic environment, where consumers are more selective in their spending. Despite noticeable price hikes on certain iconic items and occasional criticisms of declining quality, these brands maintain their dominance by delivering an aspirational yet reliable value proposition.\n\nThe rise of mega-brands\n\nThe concept of the \u201cmega-brand\u201d, epitomized by Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e8s, and Chanel, is the benchmark that others, like Dior and Gucci, are striving to achieve. Gucci\u2019s recent pivot\u2014marked by a change in creative leadership\u2014is emblematic of the industry\u2019s need to adapt. Moving away from the \u201cgeek chic\u201d aesthetic that once defined its identity, Gucci now aims to appeal to a broader audience in pursuit of ambitious revenue targets. This shift reflects a critical balance luxury brands must strike: preserving a distinct brand image while ensuring its relevance to a wider, often younger, demographic.\n\nEmerging markets, particularly India and Southeast Asia, are becoming critical growth engines for luxury brands. Here, the ability of mega-brands to differentiate themselves takes center stage. In Southeast Asia, younger consumers are embracing a more experimental approach to luxury, heavily shaped by internet-driven trends and virality. Meanwhile, older consumers in the region prioritize loyalty to established brands, valuing quality and heritage. To thrive, luxury brands must adopt a dual strategy: capturing the attention of digitally savvy younger audiences while reinforcing their legacy and timeless appeal for more traditional, established buyers.\n\nThe rise of non-luxury and Asian powerhouses in global fashion\n\nWhile high-end Western brands dominate discussions on market capitalization, a closer look at other metrics reveals more nuanced insights. Let\u2019s explore one such metric: brand value. Brand value represents the financial worth of a brand as perceived by consumers, reflecting the premium they are willing to pay for products or services associated with it. In contrast, market capitalization (or \"market cap\") calculates the total value of a company\u2019s outstanding shares by multiplying its stock price by the number of available shares, providing an evaluation of the company\u2019s market performance and investor confidence.\n\nNike and Inditex shine as non-luxury powerhouses\n\nIf one looks at how much consumers perceive a brand, its 'brand value', then Nike is still a big winner: the brand has maintained a top spot in brand value, reaching an impressive 37.6 billion dollars, according to FashionUnited. This success is driven by innovative marketing strategies and a loyal customer base. Meanwhile, Inditex, boasting a market cap of 177 billion dollars, demonstrates resilience through its diversified portfolio, with Zara (brand value 16.2 billion) contributing 72.52% of its revenue.\n\nAthleisure and and fast-fashion gain momentum\n\nWhy have these brands excelled? A significant factor is the continued rise of athleisure and fast fashion in 2024. The athleisure sector has indeed continued to thrive, with Lululemon ranking third in brand value among fashion brands at 20.6 billion dollars. Its premium activewear and expanding global presence have solidified its position as a key player. Meanwhile, Shein, a fast-fashion disruptor, has made significant strides with a 16 billion dollars brand value, demonstrating an unparalleled ability to capture trends and deliver affordability at unprecedented speeds. Most notably, Shein could emerge as the biggest winner in terms of revenue growth, with an estimated increase of 30% for 2024.\n\nThe rise of Asian players\n\nThe 2024 landscape offers another intriguing shift: Chinese sportswear giant ANTA, valued at 2.9 billion dollars, exemplifies the rising influence of Asia\u2019s domestic champions. ANTA\u2019s focus on innovation, quality, and its stronghold in the booming Chinese market has propelled it into the global spotlight. Similarly, Japan\u2019s Uniqlo, with a brand value of 15.1 billion dollars, continues to expand its global footprint, leveraging its reputation for minimalist design and superior quality. These brands reflect the maturation of Asia\u2019s fashion market, where rising consumer affluence, digital sophistication, and cultural confidence are driving robust growth. As Asian brands gain ground, they challenge traditional Western dominance, signaling a more diversified and competitive global fashion ecosystem.\n\nFor Western luxury brands, this translates into crafting strategies that resonate with a younger, tech-savvy demographic while preserving their global allure. As brands increasingly focus on engaging the younger generation, this shift in focus naturally highlights a critical arena: tech - and its indispensable partner, social networks.\n\nThe other metric at play: TikTok and Instagram\n\nTikTok and Instagram have not just become platforms for engagement but powerful engines driving brand visibility and revenue. The GoatAgency\u2019s provocative question \u2014 \u201cWho are the top fashion brands on TikTok, and why should you care?\u201d \u2014 underscores the seismic shift in how trends are born and consumer loyalty is cultivated. For brands, it\u2019s not just about being present; it\u2019s about leveraging these platforms to shape culture and, ultimately, their bottom line.\n\nTikTok, in particular, has redefined how fashion trends emerge and spread. Viral challenges and hauls have propelled fast fashion brands like Shein and Zara to the forefront of the cultural zeitgeist. Hashtags such as #SheinHaul or #ZaraOutfits garner millions of views, functioning as organic advertisements while empowering consumers to act as brand ambassadors. These grassroots campaigns are hyper-effective in translating visibility into conversions, often in record time.\n\nHowever, the platform\u2019s impact isn\u2019t confined to fast fashion. Luxury brands are also finding creative ways to carve their niche. Burberry\u2019s interactive challenges or Gucci\u2019s AR-driven filters show how high-end labels can use TikTok\u2019s features to blend exclusivity with approachability, capturing a younger demographic without diluting their brand identity.\n\nFashionUnited\u2019s business intelligence indexes confirm the value of this strategy by consistently tracking brand performance on social networks. The insights reveal a direct correlation between social media dominance and market success, further validating the importance of these platforms in the marketing mix.\n\nCredits: FashionUnited business intelligence\n\nFor businesses, the takeaway is clear: investing in social-first strategies is no longer optional. TikTok and its counterparts are not merely tools for engagement but pivotal arenas where consumer preferences, brand equity, and future revenues are being shaped. The brands that lead in this space are those that understand the nuances of social storytelling and adapt to the fast-evolving digital landscape with agility and authenticity.\n\nCertain brands, like Shein and Temu, are rewriting the rules by revolutionizing both the production chain and the consumer experience. Shein, for instance, has mastered the art of \u201cextreme fast fashion,\u201d launching a staggering 315,000 new products in 2022, reports Foxintelligence\u2014far outpacing Zara\u2019s 6,850. This unmatched ability to respond almost instantly to micro-trends allows Shein to capture consumer attention and spending while rendering each collection quickly obsolete. Their strategy is as aggressive as it is effective, relying on real-time data analytics, optimized logistics, and hyper-targeted digital marketing. But what is the big picture of this extreme online popularity?\n\nCredits: FashionUnited business intelligence\n\nHow exactly did some brands explode in popularity?\n\nThe meteoric rise of mass market and fast fashion brands on social networks is a testament to their savvy use of digital platforms to engage with a global audience. Brands like Shein and Zara have mastered the digital landscape, using social media to capture a global audience through targeted ads, influencer partnerships, and user-generated content. The speed and immediacy of fast fashion align perfectly with the visual nature of platforms like Instagram and TikTok, driving engagement and fostering a community of loyal followers. This feedback loop enables brands to quickly respond to consumer demand, reinforcing the appeal of fast fashion.\n\nToward a new era of distribution and marketing\n\nBuilding on this digital success, brands are now embracing the broader digital landscape. The fashion and luxury industries are undergoing a strategic transformation, with entertainment playing a central role in engaging and captivating consumers. By launching its own podcast, Kering didn\u2019t just embrace an innovative format\u2014it redefined its dialogue with audiences, creating content that transcends products to tackle issues like sustainability, ethics, and broader societal questions. It\u2019s no longer just about selling but establishing a role as a culturally relevant and engaged player.\n\nCredits: FashionUnited business intelligence\n\nThis strategy goes beyond mere experimentation. It reflects a broader trend where brands embed themselves in the entertainment landscape to remain central to cultural conversations. Whether through collaborations with K-Pop icons or ambitious ventures like the Apple TV+ series The New Look (focused on Christian Dior), luxury brands are building bridges between products and storytelling. Saint Laurent\u2019s foray into film production exemplifies how such initiatives can transform a brand into a creator of cultural experiences rather than just a purveyor of goods.\n\nThis \u201cmarketing entertainment\u201d, or brand entertainment, is not a passing fad. It\u2019s a bold response to advertising saturation and evolving consumer expectations. In a world where attention is the ultimate currency, weaving compelling narratives and strong values into marketing strategies is no longer optional\u2014it\u2019s imperative. Tomorrow\u2019s successful brands will be those that position themselves as cultural and emotional touchstones while rising to the challenges of a more conscientious world.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with Reelshort?\n\nMeanwhile, for brands catering to the hyper-connected audience\u2014including both youthful consumers and the new \u201cstay-at-home\u201d mom archetype\u2014the shift in media habits is undeniable. And this shift has most likely already been named: Reelshort.\n\nTouted as the \u201cnext generation of HD streaming platforms,\u201d ReelShort\u2014a Chinese short-form video app owned by COL Group\u2014specializes in serialized dramas designed for mobile consumption. Its content is unapologetically fast-paced, prioritizing rapid plot twists, emotional highs, and cliffhangers over deep character development. With minimalistic production values, unknown actors, and simple sets, these 1-minute episodes adhere to the aesthetic and pacing of reels and shorts: immediate engagement, heightened drama, and a lingering \u201cwhat happens next?\u201d appeal.\n\nSome of Reelshort\u2019s mini-series align seamlessly with popular trends, such as the \"Old Money\" aesthetic, though they diverge from the more subtle \u201cquiet luxury\u201d movement. For instance, shows like The Double Life of My Billionaire Fianc\u00e9 tap into aspirational tropes: young and wealthy women, ambitious upstarts, old-money families, and the archetypal charismatic billionaire. These settings naturally lend themselves to fashion trends and collaborations, creating fertile ground for brands to engage with audiences. With such shows gaining traction across TikTok and Instagram, it\u2019s easy to imagine how their visual storytelling could inspire new style waves.\n\nThe Double Life of My Billionaire Fianc\u00e9, produced and distributed by Crazy Maple Studio on Reelshort, has garnered over 419 million views, according to TIME Magazine. For context, that surpasses Netflix's Squid Game season one, which reached 265 million views as of November 4. Reelshort\u2019s TikTok account has 1.4 million followers, with another 1.7 million on Instagram. Regional accounts, like \u201cReelShortLat\u201d for Latin America, expand its global reach with over 12.4 million likes. Besides, the recent launch of \u201cReelTalk-Podcast\u201d further signals podcasts\u2019 growing role in brands\u2019 future strategies.\n\nChina\u2019s full circle of influence and power\n\nSo what\u2019s the deal with Reelshort? Well, the story being written by Reelshort and TikTok is one of China's growing dominance in the global digital and cultural landscape. Through platforms like Reelshort and TikTok, China is not only shaping entertainment but also influencing consumer behavior, fashion trends, and digital commerce in profound ways.\n\nReelshort is crafting a narrative of fast-paced, mobile-first entertainment that resonates with today\u2019s hyper-connected, on-the-go audiences. With its bite-sized, dramatic series designed for quick consumption, Reelshort is redefining how stories are told and experienced. The platform\u2019s content\u2014featuring quick plot twists, emotional highs, and aspirational themes\u2014appeals to a global audience, particularly younger consumers. It integrates seamlessly with fashion trends, allowing brands to tap into its massive reach, and signaling how entertainment and commerce are becoming increasingly intertwined.\n\nOn the other hand, TikTok has evolved into a powerful global force that transcends mere social media. It has become an engine for fashion and pop culture, allowing brands to thrive by reaching millions through viral content, influencer partnerships, and user-generated campaigns. TikTok\u2019s format, driven by short-form videos, taps into an audience\u2019s craving for immediacy, with trends emerging and evolving at lightning speed. The platform has also become a key tool for brands to engage directly with consumers, using entertainment and culture to drive brand awareness and loyalty.\n\nConnecting these dots paints a clearer picture: China is emerging as a dominant force in reshaping global industries. Its influence now stretches beyond technology and entertainment to include fashion, consumer behavior, and digital commerce. Platforms like TikTok and Reelshort are at the forefront of this transformation, symbolizing China\u2019s ability to shape cultural trends and redefine how businesses engage with consumers. With its control over entertainment, technology, e-commerce, and payment systems, China is completing a full circle of global influence, seamlessly blending entertainment with commerce in ways previously unimaginable.\n\nChina is now achieving a full circle of influence and power, with giants in technology, e-commerce, payment platforms, entertainment, and fashion. This integrated ecosystem reduces the reliance on external platforms for success. With Alibaba, AliExpress, and Alipay leading e-commerce and financial services, and platforms like Douyin (TikTok) and Reelshort shaping social media and entertainment, China has built a self-sustaining infrastructure that propels its own homegrown powerhouses.\n\nThis interconnected ecosystem creates an ideal environment for promoting homegrown brands like Anta, where the synergy between e-commerce, social media, and fintech allows Chinese brands to thrive independently. However, challenges persist\u2014particularly the need to move beyond the \"Made in China\" label and break free from Western influences. Yet, our presence at CHIC Shanghai this summer brought into sharp focus China\u2019s unwavering commitment to nurturing a new wave of national designers. The event spotlighted an emerging generation of creative talent poised to set original trends, hinting at a future where China\u2019s fashion industry is driven by homegrown innovation rather than imitation.\n\nOne can only commend the strategic efforts deployed by China over the years to solidify its position as a global powerhouse, now populated by impressive giants ready to compete across multiple key sectors. Yet, this growing dominance raises critical questions about the future landscape of global fashion. As brands like Shein rise to prominence, there is a broader conversation to be had about the implications of this shift. The success of Chinese tech and entertainment giants like TikTok and Reelshort underscores the increasing influence of Chinese companies on a global scale. An influence which extends beyond technology and entertainment into fashion, where Chinese brands are not only competing but setting new benchmarks for speed and responsiveness.\n\nThe dominance of these brands prompts reflection on several fronts: sustainability, ethical production, and the balance of power in the global fashion industry. As Chinese brands continue to rise, their strategies and practices will likely shape the future of fashion, compelling established players to adapt and innovate to maintain their foothold. The integration of advanced analytics, AI-driven personalization, and digital-first strategies will be crucial in thriving this evolving landscape.\n\nTrends set in 2024\u2019s fashion landscape\n\nAs we look ahead, the broader trends that defined 2024\u2019s fashion industry are also worthy of attention. The global fashion scene in 2024 has been a canvas of transformation, shaped by technological innovation, sustainability imperatives, and the shifting priorities of consumers.\n\nAmong the most defining trends are the acceleration of digitalization and the rise of direct-to-consumer (DTC) models, which are reshaping how brands engage with consumers. Brands like Shein and Zara exemplify this shift, leveraging robust online platforms and data-driven decision-making to cater to an increasingly tech-savvy audience. Shein\u2019s rapid-response model, where trends go from concept to consumer in mere days, has set a new benchmark for agility in fashion, challenging traditional supply chain norms.\n\nAt the same time, sustainability has evolved from a value-added proposition to an industry standard. Consumers are demanding transparency, and brands like Uniqlo and Adidas are responding by investing in sustainable materials, ethical sourcing, and circular fashion initiatives. Uniqlo\u2019s ongoing focus on quality over quantity and its environmentally conscious campaigns highlight a broader trend where longevity and purpose are beginning to outweigh fleeting trends.\n\nAnother defining shift has been the growing influence of lifestyle brands like Lululemon and Gymshark. These companies have bridged the gap between fashion and functionality, catering to the athleisure movement that prioritizes comfort, wellness, and style. Such brands thrive in a post-pandemic world where hybrid lifestyles demand adaptable wardrobes.\n\nLuxury brands, too, are navigating the demands of modern consumers. Heritage names like Dior, Herm\u00e8s, and LVMH have embraced digital channels and global outreach while preserving their artisanal appeal. The expansion into emerging markets, particularly in Asia, underscores a strategic pivot to tap into regions with growing affluence and an appetite for luxury.\n\nFinally, collaborations and cultural alignments remain pivotal strategies. From sportswear brands partnering with celebrities and designers to high-fashion brands embracing streetwear aesthetics, 2024 emphasizes the blending of worlds to create unique, resonant products.\n\nLessons from 2024\u2019s fashion industry\n\nThe 2024 fashion industry tells a tale of contrasts and convergence. On one side, mass-market players like Zara and H&M continue to dominate with scalable operations, while on the other, niche luxury brands like Herm\u00e8s and Dior maintain allure with exclusivity. The divergence in strategies is a testament to the diverse demands of modern consumers, who seek both accessibility and aspiration. A common denominator for both luxury and non-luxury brands seems to be relatability and engagement. Nike\u2019s unparalleled dominance in brand value, at 71.6 billion dollars, reflects its ability to consistently innovate and engage audiences across demographics. Its focus on storytelling, sustainability, and inclusivity has made it a universal favorite. Similarly, Zara\u2019s rapid growth in brand valuation underscores the power of fast fashion when paired with operational efficiency and trend responsiveness.\n\nLuxury\u2019s enduring appeal, as evidenced by LVMH\u2019s towering market cap of 392.66 billion dollars, shows that exclusivity and heritage remain unmatched in their ability to command consumer loyalty. The sector\u2019s adaptability\u2014embracing digital channels, sustainability, and younger audiences\u2014ensures it stays relevant.\n\nThe emergence of Shein as a major player highlights the disruptive potential of digital-first strategies and price accessibility. However, its model also raises critical questions about environmental and ethical standards, an area where legacy brands are increasingly focusing their efforts.\n\nAthleisure and functional fashion are no longer trends but staples. Brands like Lululemon have reshaped fashion\u2019s narrative, proving that comfort and style are not mutually exclusive. This shift aligns with broader societal changes emphasizing wellness and work-life balance.\n\nGeographically, Asia continues to shine as the new growth epicenter. With rising disposable incomes and a burgeoning middle class, markets like China and India are driving the industry\u2019s next growth phase. Global brands are realigning their strategies to capture this demographic, leading to tailored product offerings and localized campaigns. The rise of Chinese brands adds another layer of complexity, signaling a shift in the global balance of power that will undoubtedly influence the future of fashion.\n\nTechnology remains the ultimate enabler of transformation. From advanced analytics to AI-driven personalization, brands are investing in tools that refine customer experiences and streamline operations. The integration of virtual try-ons, AR-enhanced shopping, and digital fashion further cements the industry\u2019s shift into a hybrid reality where physical and digital worlds coexist seamlessly.\n\nWhat next?\n\n2024 has been a landmark year for the apparel industry, showcasing a mix of steady luxury growth and disruptive innovation. As the world emerges from economic uncertainties, brands with a clear focus on sustainability, digital transformation, and consumer engagement are poised to thrive. Will luxury houses like Louis Vuitton continue their dominance, or will disruptors like Shein redefine the industry? One thing is certain: the apparel industry remains as dynamic and unpredictable as ever.",
