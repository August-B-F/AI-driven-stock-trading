            "content": "Visa Inc V remains the undisputed scale leader in the payments industry, but Mastercard Inc MA has been outpacing its rival in growth.\n\nShould investors bet on Visa's dominance or Mastercard's momentum?\n\nJPMorgan's Tien-tsin Huang analyzes the key differences between the two payment giants, focusing on their financials, shareholder returns, and valuation dynamics.\n\nScale Vs. Speed: Who Wins?\n\nVisa's dominance is clear \u2014 it boasts 63% more total volume, 31% more revenue, and an enviable ten-point operating margin advantage, thanks to superior fixed cost leverage. It also has 50% more cards outstanding and commands nearly two-thirds of the global market share in purchase volume.\n\nHowever, Mastercard has been running circles around Visa in growth, capitalizing on a mix of faster-expanding regions and revenue streams. According to Huang, Mastercard outpaced Visa in revenue growth by about two percentage points, maintaining its five-year average edge. Even on the bottom line, Mastercard's adjusted EPS grew four percentage points faster, thanks to margin expansion\u2014something Visa couldn't pull off last year.\n\nRead Also: Stripe\u2019s Payment Surge Puts Adyen, PayPal, Fiserv On Notice \u2013 AI, Stablecoins Fuel The Race\n\nShareholder Returns: A Dead Heat\n\nBoth companies are cash flow powerhouses, returning nearly all of their adjusted net income to shareholders via aggressive share buybacks. In 2024, Mastercard and Visa shares gained 23% and 21%, respectively, mirroring the S&P 500's performance.\n\nHowever, Huang notes that Visa has taken the early lead in 2025, benefiting from investors' appetite for U.S. growth and a reduced regulatory overhang.\n\nThe Valuation Puzzle\n\nNetwork multiples have expanded, with Mastercard trading at 33x forward earnings versus Visa's 28x.\n\nWhile both remain in line with their historical premium to the S&P 500, Huang points out that Mastercard's higher multiple reflects its stronger growth profile, while Visa's relative value case is gaining traction.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nHuang isn't picking sides, maintaining an Overweight rating on both stocks. Mastercard's growth premium looks sustainable, but Visa's relative value and easing regulatory risks could make it the safer bet.\n\nInvestors have a choice\u2014go big with Visa or go fast with Mastercard. Either way, it's a battle of titans worth watching.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage: Shutterstock",

This in-depth analysis sheds light on the current landscape of digital payments, with a focus on key advancements in on-chain settlement, revenue-sharing models and enterprise-first payment infrastructure.\n\nDelving into the evolution of stablecoin technology and its integration into market segments that connect crypto payments with traditional financial services, Foresight Ventures presents a comprehensive framework detailing the layered approach to stablecoin adoption\u2014from the application layer to asset issuance and settlement processes.\n\nOf particular note, the report offers exclusive insights for diverse user groups, ranging from general investors to developers. It also breaks down the critical factors driving enterprise adoption of stablecoins and demonstrates how non-crypto users can incorporate these digital assets into everyday transactions.\n\nKey discoveries from the analysis are:\n\nStablecoin payments offer faster settlement times and lower fees than traditional methods.\n\nThe technology stack breaks down into four layers: Application, payment processors, asset issuers and settlement.\n\nMajor payment gateways now integrate with popular financial services, enabling both developer and consumer adoption.\n\nUS payment services giant Stripe now integrates USDC for global transactions. MetaMask enables fiat-to-crypto on/off-ramps via third-party services.\n\nCrypto payment platform Helio supports 450,000 active wallets and 6,000 merchants , with the Solana Pay plugin allowing Shopify. This shows large-scale adoption among merchants.\n\nThe use of crypto cards\u2014developed in partnership with Visa and Mastercard\u2014is on the rise. These cards empower users to seamlessly transact with stablecoins at traditional merchants.\n\nAsset issuers innovate with static reserve-backed, yield-bearing and revenue-sharing models. Revenue-sharing stablecoins from Paxos, M\u2070 and Agora align incentives by distributing transaction fees and interest income among ecosystem partners.\n\nSettlement layers on multiple blockchains allow for instant and cost-efficient transactions. Blockchains, like Solana and Tron, enable near-instant settlement and low fees.\n\nEnterprise adoption revolves around efficient treasury management, integrated KYC processes and on-chain yield opportunities.\n\nNon-crypto users benefit from intuitive interfaces and the integration of stablecoin payment options within mainstream apps.\n\nA future shift may see consumers hold capital on-chain, as risk management and yield opportunities improve.\n\nCore findings emphasize the transformative potential of stablecoins in transaction processing and corporate treasury management. Enterprises are increasingly leveraging stablecoin infrastructure to enhance global payment efficiency and improve liquidity. Additionally, companies are adopting smart routing solutions to automate cross-border transactions, minimizing manual intervention and cutting operating costs.\n\n\u201cOur stablecoin report extensively captures how the global payment ecosystem is going through a massive transformation driven by stablecoins,\u201d said Forest Bai, co-founder of Foresight Ventures. \u201cStripe's integration of USD and Helio's support for over 450,000 active wallets clearly signal a rising demand for stablecoins in everyday transactions. On-chain solutions are streamlining payment flows and enhancing liquidity, paving the way for faster, more efficient digital payments.\"\n\nThe report identifies that revenue-sharing stablecoins introduce a dynamic incentive model to the market. This approach harmonizes the interests of financial institutions, fintech applications and digital asset platforms, driving more efficient financial exchanges. It also reveals that consumers can benefit from earning on-chain yields through user-friendly interfaces and integrated financial services.\n\nThe Foresight Ventures stablecoin report holds significant value for stakeholders across the financial spectrum.

The spokesperson declined to say how many community banks the card network currently works with.\n\nMajor U.S. financial institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, dominate the banking industry, but there are thousands of smaller banks across the U.S., totaling about 9,000 institutions overall.\n\nIncreasingly, smaller banks have struggled to keep up with the fast-paced evolution of bank and payments technologies, as their larger rivals advance by spending heavily on new digital and real-time systems. Some smaller banks have struck partnerships with fintechs to try to stay competitive with their peers.\n\nCommunity banks are defined by the Federal Reserve as those with less than $10 billion in assets, and regional banks as those with $10 billion to $100 billion, according to the Fed\u2019s website.\n\nUnder the new services, ICBA Payments\u2019 banks will have access to \u201ccontactless plastics, tokenization to digital wallets, and industry standard 8-digit BINs and business BIN optimization,\u201d according to the release.\n\nICBA Payments has had an existing relationship with Mastercard, as well as Visa, for credit and debit card issuance, a spokesperson for the association said. The new tie to Mastercard is an expansion of that prior relationship, the spokesperson said.\n\nICBA Payments members jointly have about 10 million credit and debit cards outstanding, making the banks, collectively, the 10th-largest issuer of debit cards and 29th-largest issuer of credit cards in the U.S., according to the release.\n\nAs part of the partnership with Purchase, New York-based Mastercard, ICBA Payments will shift its \u201csponsored card programs to Mastercard\u201d as the card network handles all the communication and marketing for members, the release said.",

It also offers a membership tier that provides perks like free 2-day shipping, free returns, member-only discounts, and more.\n\nTypically, a ShopRunner membership costs $79 per year, but it\u2019s been provided as a complimentary benefit on a wide range of American Express credit cards and on Mastercard\u2019s World and World Elite cards.\n\nShopRunner Membership Going Away for Some Mastercard Products\n\nWe reported a few days ago that American Express would no longer provide a complimentary ShopRunner membership to cardholders. Now, we\u2019ve learned that the benefit is also going away for World and World Elite Mastercard products as of September 30, 2025.\n\nThe Amex-provided ShopRunner membership has quite a long runway for its sunset, as cardholders have 2 years from the expiration of the existing membership year to enjoy benefits.\n\nHowever, the fine print of the Mastercard-ShopRunner partnership states: \u201cEligible World and World Elite Mastercard cardholders can enroll for a complimentary ShopRunner membership through September 30, 2025\u201d \u2014 with no language discussing a long off-ramp for cardholders.\n\nWhile World and World Elite Mastercard products will lose complimentary ShopRunner memberships at the end of September, they still offer a respectable list of benefits and protections. Plus, ShopRunner itself offers a yearlong free trial of a membership, which you can sign up for here.\n\nWorld Mastercard products include perks such as Mastercard Hotels & Resorts Collection Benefits, car rental insurance, trip cancellation and interruption insurance, cell phone protection, purchase protection, extended warranty, price protection, and more.\n\nMastercard is one of the 3 major payment processing platforms. Image Credit: Upgraded Points\n\nWorld Elite Mastercard products include all of those benefits and more, including access to the World Elite concierge, car rental perks, additional statement credits and discounts with several platforms, and even more.\n\nHot Tip: Learn about the top World Elite Mastercard benefits and the best World Elite card products in our full guide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nShopRunner memberships will no longer be a complimentary benefit of World and World Elite Mastercard products. This news comes on the heels of American Express sharing that it will remove complimentary ShopRunner memberships from its cards, though Amex cardholders can still have access to their memberships for at least 2 years.\n\nIf you enjoy and value a ShopRunner membership, remember that you can sign up for a free trial for an entire year!",

And this, of course, extends to HR, and how the sector uses data to drive decision-making.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly using data as a team \u2013 so it\u2019s embedded into our ways of working and collective mindset as a team,\u201d Sheopuri explains.\n\nWe use the insights from our employee surveys to drive change throughout the organization; we use data to build our workforce planning strategies; we use data from our talent marketplace to learn more about our global skills across the enterprise; and countless other ways.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Sheopuri has been focused on using this approach to foster a data-driven culture within HR, as he believes it\u2019s paramount to deliver a strategy at the intersection of business needs and employee needs.\n\n\u201cThese two factors need to work in lockstep,\u201d he adds. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019ll either miss out on strategic value and business outcomes, or on the other end you won\u2019t have the intended user engagement and adoption.\n\n\u201cThroughout my career, my roles have focused on using data to think about our employee journeys \u2013 from end to end.\n\n\u201cNow, here at Mastercard, we examine each step of the employee lifecycle \u2013 for example: onboarding or promotion/role change or becoming a people leader for the first time \u2013 and explore ways to make the process or experience more personal and seamless for our employees.\u201d\n\nBy capitalizing on this data-centered, AI approach, Sheopuri and his team are ensuring Mastercard is providing seamless EX, while using technology in a responsible and way.",

What are we waiting for @NPCI_NPCI ?\n\nNPCI\u2019s Big change to UPI\n\nShark Tank India judge Anupam Mittal has called for leveraging India\u2019s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) to challenge global payment giants like Visa and Mastercard. In a post on X, Mittal highlighted how UPI has enabled \"global-scale frictionless & costless transactions\" in India. He further suggested that it is time to disrupt companies like Visa, Mastercard and even banks that charge transaction fees ranging from 2-5% on a multi-trillion dollar payment industry.In his post, the People Group founder urged the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) to take action, stating, \"India-tech for the world is ready. What are we waiting for?\"In the post, Mittal said:Launched in 2016, UPI has revolutionized digital payments in India with instant, low-cost transactions. It has also expanded internationally through partnerships in countries like Singapore, the UAE, and France. The statement comes as discussions grow on reducing dependence on foreign payment systems and enhancing India's global fintech presence.In another news, NPCI has begun gradually eliminating the 'Collect Payments' feature from the UPI platform to address growing fraud concerns, according to banking officials familiar with the matter. An Economic Times report states that this pull-based payment method, which allows merchants to request money directly from users' UPI apps, has become increasingly vulnerable to scams.Under the new directive, pull payments will be limited to large, verified merchants, while person-to-person collect requests will have a cap of Rs 2,000.",

The global economy has managed through a series of shocks admirably over the past few years. The report anticipates 2025 to be defined by shifts in monetary and fiscal policy and a move toward equilibrium rates for growth and inflation.\n\nIn Kenya, the GDP in 2025 is projected to grow by 4.7% year over year, outpacing the global average which is forecast at 3.2.% \u2013 a modest increase on 3.1% in 2024. Meanwhile, consumer spending in the country is predicted to rise by 4%, and consumer price inflation is likely to stabilize at 4.8%, offering much-needed relief to households and businesses.\n\nEconomic growth is supported by a robust remittance ecosystem and high female labor force participation, which continues to drive household incomes. Kenya\u2019s economy demonstrates resilience amid global shifts, leveraging digital innovation and regional trade integration to sustain progress.\n\n\u201cKenya\u2019s economic outlook for 2025 highlights its potential for robust growth, underpinned by high remittance inflows, active female workforce participation, and digital transformation. These trends position the country as a leader in fostering inclusive and sustainable development,\u201d said Khatija Haque, chief economist, EEMEA, Mastercard.\n\nShehryar Ali, Senior Vice President and Country Manager for East Africa and Indian Ocean Islands at Mastercard, shared, \u201cKenya\u2019s digital evolution is accelerating at a fast pace, and Mastercard is committed to driving this transformation. As the \u2018Silicon Savannah,\u2019 Kenya leads in innovation, and we\u2019re enhancing acceptance with tokenization, wearables, and contactless payments. These solutions, along with our first multi-currency prepaid card, streamline payments and empower communities to engage confidently in global commerce.\u201d\n\nKey findings from the report include:\n\nPricing priorities\n\nConsumers worldwide have been navigating a bumpy road of rising prices over the last five years, largely driven by the pandemic and geopolitical tensions. While inflation\u2014the rate of increase in prices\u2014has slowed significantly, price levels themselves remain elevated. In Kenya, inflation is forecast to stabilize at 4.8% in 2025, reflecting global trends.\n\nThis moderation creates opportunities for sustained consumer spending, particularly in essential sectors such as food, healthcare, and education. However, lingering price pressures continue to influence consumer behavior, with households opting for more affordable versions of discretionary items. This trend of \u2018trading down\u2019 is reflected in Kenya\u2019s real consumer spending growth, projected at 4% in 2025, aligning with global purchasing behaviors.\n\nMigration and money\n\nThe last few years have seen significant movement in people and, by extension, capital. Migration, while resulting in a loss of human capital, also generates substantial remittances, which serve as a lifeline for low- and middle-income communities in developing economies. According to the World Bank, global remittances surged from $128 billion in 2000 to $857 billion in 2023, with an estimated growth of 3% in 2024 and 2025. Economic recovery and local reforms are expected to sustain remittance growth through 2025, while the continued digitization of the payments industry allows recipients to shift to digital and mobile channels, resulting in considerable cost efficiencies, security and convenience.\n\nIn Kenya, migration continues to shape the country\u2019s economic landscape, significantly contributing to remittance inflows. In 2023, remittances accounted for 3.9% of GDP, up from a pre-pandemic average of 2.3%, underscoring their critical role in supporting household incomes and economic resilience. Kenya\u2019s robust mobile money infrastructure, led by platforms like M-Pesa, further enhances the efficiency and accessibility of remittances. These platforms facilitate secure and convenient cross-border transactions, reducing costs and empowering underserved communities.\n\nThe rise of the SHEconomy\n\nThe global economy saw the \u2018great resignation\u2019 turn into the \u2018great return\u2019. To varying degrees across countries, there has been a return of workers, particularly in the younger cohort and, interestingly, women. Women\u2019s workforce participation in Kenya reflects this important and steady transformation aligning with global patterns where women\u2019s workforce participation has exceeded pre-pandemic levels in many regions.\n\nIn Kenya, the female labor force participation rate stood at 72.5% in 2022, one of the highest rates globally. There are several potential explanations for this phenomenon. One, women\u2019s labor force participation likely reflects the disproportionate job creation in female-dominated sectors, such as healthcare and education. In addition, the rise of remote work and the flexibility it brings tends to help women, who are often still the primary caregivers, as it makes it easier to raise children while working. Many of these dynamics will remain true in 2025, with positive implications for the economy due to driving consumption growth by increasing households\u2019 disposable incomes\n\nThe \u2018Economic Outlook 2025\u2019 report draws on a multitude of public and proprietary data sets, including aggregated and anonymized Mastercard sales activity, as well as models that are intended to estimate economic activity.",

            "content": "MasterCard (MA) ended the recent trading session at $536.09, demonstrating a +1.11% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.08%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.92%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 1.41%.\n\nThe processor of debit and credit card payments's shares have seen a decrease of 6.76% over the last month, surpassing the Business Services sector's loss of 12.62% and the S&P 500's loss of 8.26%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of MasterCard in its upcoming release. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $3.57, signifying a 7.85% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $7.12 billion, indicating a 12.18% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nMA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $15.88 per share and revenue of $31.56 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +8.77% and +12.06%, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for MasterCard. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.15% decrease. As of now, MasterCard holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nDigging into valuation, MasterCard currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 33.38. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 15.27, so one might conclude that MasterCard is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nIt's also important to note that MA currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.32. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Financial Transaction Services industry stood at 1.4 at the close of the market yesterday.",

            "content": "Continental Finance is a credit card company that services credit cards for consumers with limited, fair or bad credit (FICO scores of 300-689). It's not a bank, and therefore the company does not actually issue credit cards. Rather, it partners with banks that do, and its portfolio includes:\n\nThese products all share some important similarities. They\u2019re unsecured cards, so a security deposit is not required to open the account. All cards report user activity to the three major credit bureaus, so by spending below your credit limit and paying off balances in full every month, you may be able to help your credit scores. And as an incentive, any one of these cards will double the initial credit limit after the first six monthly minimum payments are made on time.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t outweigh the bad. Major drawbacks of Continental Finance credit cards include myriad expensive fees, dizzying interest rates and no upgrade path to a better product when you're ready. And to get any of these cards, you'll need a checking account, which can present its own hurdles.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of Continental Finance credit cards, plus some recommendations for alternatives that are less costly and more rewarding, even if you have bad credit.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Note that Continental Finance is different from the similarly named Continental Bank, which actually is a true bank and card issuer (not merely a servicer) for products like the Pesto Secured Rewards Mastercard\u00ae and the Zable MasterCard\u00ae Credit Card.\n\nAt a glance\n\nCard name Annual fee Monthly fee Initial credit limit Cerulean Mastercard $125. None. $300-$1,000. Fit Mastercard $99. Waived the first 12 months, then $6.25 per month. $400. Reflex\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae $75-$125 in the first 12 months, then $99-$125 annually. Waived the first 12 months, then $12.50 per month. $300-$1,000. Revel Mastercard $75 - $125 in the first 12 months, then $99 - $125 annually. Waived the first 12 months, then $0-$10 per month. $300-$1,000. Surge\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae $75-$125 in the first 12 months, then $99-$125 annually. Waived the first 12 months, then $0-$12.50 per month. $300-$1,000. Verve Mastercard $75-$125 in the first 12 months, then $99-$125 annually. Waived the first 12 months, then $0-$10 per month. $300-$1,000.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The annual fee for all six Continental Finance credit cards is assessed upon account opening and thus immediately lowers your available credit. For example, if the card has a $300 credit limit and a $99 annual fee, you would be able to spend $201. You won't have access to the full credit limit until the annual fee is paid.\n\nCerulean credit card\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nThe Cerulean credit card charges a hefty annual fee for a card with little upside. The annual fee is $125, and you won\u2019t receive a credit limit higher than $1,000 upon account opening. And unlike an upfront deposit required for a secured credit card, annual fees are not refundable. As unappealing as these terms are, they're hardly the worst when compared with some of the other cards serviced by Continental Finance. (That dishonor may go to the next card on this list, the Fit credit card.)\n\nAlternative pick: Chime Secured Credit Builder Visa\u00ae Credit Card acts like a reloadable debit card in some ways, but it reports user activity to all three credit bureaus like a credit card. This card doesn\u2019t charge an annual fee or APR, but you need a Chime\u00ae account to get it.\n\nSee more from Chime\u00ae Chime says the following: The secured Chime Credit Builder Visa\u00ae Credit Card is issued by The Bancorp Bank, N.A. or Stride Bank, N.A., pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. and may be used everywhere Visa credit cards are accepted. Please see the back of your card for its issuing bank.\n\nTo apply for Credit Builder, you must have an active Chime\u00ae Checking Account. Based on a representative study conducted by Experian\u00ae in January 2024, members who made their first purchase with Credit Builder between June 2022 and October 2022 observed an average FICO\u00ae Score 8 increase of 30 points after approximately 8 months. On-time payment history can have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score. On-time payment history may have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score. Chime will report your activities to Transunion\u00ae, Experian\u00ae, and Equifax\u00ae. Impact on your credit may vary, as Credit scores are independently determined by credit bureaus based on a number of factors including the financial decisions you make with other financial services organizations. Money added to Credit Builder will be held in a secured deposit account as collateral for your Credit Builder Visa card, and you can spend up to this amount. You can use money deposited in your Secured Deposit Account to pay off your charges at the end of every month. Out-of-network ATM withdrawal and over the counter advance fees may apply except at MoneyPass ATMs in a 7-Eleven, or any Allpoint or Visa Plus Alliance ATM.\n\nFit credit card\n\nThe Fit credit card charges an annual fee of $99, which at a glance seems better than the Cerulean. But the fees don\u2019t stop there. If you want the Fit credit card, you\u2019ll have to pay a one-time $89 processing fee to open the account. Because of those two fees, you\u2019ll immediately owe $188 before you even use the card for your own purchases. After the first 12 months of having the Fit credit card, you\u2019ll also be assessed a $6.25 monthly fee ($75 for the year), which is in addition to the annual fee. The Fit credit card may offer a credit limit as high as $3,000, but that feels like a meager reward in exchange for hundreds of dollars worth of fees.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The next three credit cards on this list \u2014 the Reflex, Surge and Verve \u2014 offer a range of possible annual fees. The fee that you're actually assessed will be based on the initial credit limit you get. An annual fee of $75 in the first year is assigned a $300 credit limit; a higher annual fee of $125 in the first year comes with a bigger $1,000 credit limit.\n\nReflex\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae\n\nThe Reflex\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae earned a 1.8-star rating out of 5 from NerdWallet\u2019s credit card team, and it\u2019s easy to see why. It has an annual fee from $75 up to $125 in the first year, then from $99 up to $125 annually, plus a $12.50 monthly fee, which is waived the first year. Initial credit limits range from $300 to $1,000.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nAlternative pick: Consider instead the Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card. Its annual fee is $0, and while it does have a $200 security deposit requirement, it's refundable. The card also earns rewards, and it even has a welcome bonus, which Discover phrases this way: INTRO OFFER: Unlimited Cashback Match \u2013 only from Discover. Discover will automatically match all the cash back you\u2019ve earned at the end of your first year! There\u2019s no minimum spending or maximum rewards. Just a dollar-for-dollar match. And on top of that, you might eventually qualify to upgrade to a better Discover card.\n\nRevel credit card\n\nThe Revel card is available by invitation only, but if you happen to receive one, it\u2019s probably best to decline. It has the same ludicrous annual and monthly fees as the Reflex\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae, a bright red flag considering that card couldn\u2019t even muster a 2 out of 5-star rating in NerdWallet\u2019s rubric.\n\nAlternative pick: The Varo Believe Secured card, a similar product to the aforementioned Chime Secured Credit Builder Visa\u00ae Credit Card, is secured by the balance in a linked Varo bank account. However, that account must have received direct deposits of at least $200 in the past 90 days in order to qualify for the Varo Believe card. And, if the Safe Pay feature is enabled, Varo automatically makes credit card payments on your behalf from your Varo bank account, ensuring on-time payments.\n\nSurge\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nThe Surge\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae sings the same song as its Continental Finance siblings: It charges a steep annual fee of $75-$125 in the first year, and then $99-$125. After the first 12 months of opening the account, you may also have to pay a monthly fee of up to $12.50 per month. This means you might owe as much as $245 annually to hold this card, which is outrageous. Like the Reflex\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae, you also must have a checking account in order to open a Surge credit card.\n\nAlternative pick: The $0-annual-fee Capital One Quicksilver Secured Cash Rewards Credit Card earns an unlimited 1.5% cash back on purchases. After building up your credit, you may qualify to upgrade to an unsecured Capital One credit card.\n\nVerve credit card\n\nThe Verve credit card is practically identical to the Surge credit card; the only meaningful difference is the card issuer. That aside, the Verve and Surge credit cards have the same annual fee of $75-$125 in the first year, then $99-$125 after that. The initial credit limit on the Verve credit card is $300-$1,000, the same range as the Surge credit card. Monthly fees on the Verve credit card are waived for the first 12 months, but can cost as much as $10 thereafter.\n\nIs a Continental Finance credit card right for you?\n\nGiven their various outlandish fees, Continental Finance credit cards will be a poor fit for most consumers. If you already have one of the cards on this list, take note of when the annual and monthly fees are due and try to pay them off immediately to avoid interest charges. Consider, too, canceling the card and replacing it with something better, if your credit scores are high enough. Closing a credit card can ding your credit scores, but that penalty may be worth it if it means getting rid of a credit card with excessive fees.",

This helps financial institutions proactively prevent fraud, ensuring the security of the country\u2019s growing digital payments ecosystem.\n\n\u201cFor the Philippines, where digital payments are growing rapidly, this technology is transforming the speed and accuracy of our anti-fraud solutions,\u201d Calasanz said.\n\n\u201cIt also helps banks and businesses reduce false declines, ensuring legitimate transactions go through while blocking fraud in real time,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Mastercard, this technology scans over one trillion data points and could determine the legitimacy of a transaction in under 50 milliseconds. The company claims that this approach has improved fraud detection rates by up to 300 percent in some cases.\n\nCalasanz said the solution is crucial as e-commerce and cashless transactions continue to expand in the country, offering financial institutions a smarter way to balance security and customer experience.\n\n\u201cBy embedding AI-driven security measures, we empower financial institutions and businesses to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats, reinforcing trust and confidence in the digital payments ecosystem,\u201d he said.\n\nAside from TRACE, the company is also deploying Decision Intelligence Pro, an advanced risk management solution that assesses relationships between multiple entities within a transaction to enhance security while reducing false declines.\n\nAccording to Mastercard, it continues to work closely with financial institutions and regulators to strengthen fraud detection and prevention measures in the country.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to ensure that every digital transaction is seamless, secure and trusted,\u201d Calasanz said.",

That's because the lengthy 21 month 0% APR intro period of the Wells Fargo Reflect means that you won't pay any interest on a qualifying balance transferred from account opening (then a variable 17.24%, 23.74%, or 28.99% APR applies). If that transferred balance is large enough (or charges a high rate of interest), the money you save during that period can more than offset the Wells Fargo Reflects' balance transfer fee which is a 5%, min $5.

            "content": "experienced a modest share price movement of 0.18% over the last quarter, which was marked by significant developments, including partnerships with ICBA Payments and Jack Henry to enhance and modernize their payment services. These collaborations, aimed at improving customer experience and operational capabilities, reflect Mastercard\u2019s ongoing efforts to maintain its competitive edge. Additionally, its quarterly earnings showed impressive year-over-year growth, with net income rising to $3.3 billion in Q4. This period also saw Mastercard affirming a dividend of $0.76 per share and completing a substantial share buyback that underpins shareholder value. Although the broader market faced volatility and concerns about economic headwinds, particularly evident in the tech sector downturn, Mastercard's steady financial results and proactive strategic partnerships may have played a role in mitigating more pronounced price fluctuations amid broader market turbulence. These factors depict the company's resilience in maintaining investor confidence.\n\nNYSE:MA Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nMastercard's shares delivered a total return of 169.14% over the past five years, reflecting robust growth. The company's consistent efforts in expanding its strategic partnerships, such as the collaborations with ICBA Payments and Jack Henry, have been crucial to improving its payment infrastructure. A key highlight was the launch of biometric cards in partnership with Samsung in March 2021, which showcased Mastercard's focus on enhancing transaction security. Additionally, the integration of Mastercard Send into platforms like Nuvei in 2021 broadens the scope for seamless payouts across industries.\n\nOver the same period, Mastercard has also demonstrated strong financial performance, with annual earnings growth at 12.9%. The introduction of new products, like the Bahamas Sand Dollar prepaid card, and their real-time payments platform facilitated by ACI in Peru, reflected their commitment to digital innovation. Moreover, the company's effective use of buyback programs and dividend policies further supports shareholder returns, with notable buybacks completed in early 2025 solidifying its investor appeal.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other fintech stocks.\n\nTech stocks have faced challenges lately, and fintech companies have been hit particularly hard. On March 10, CNBC reported that the Nasdaq experienced its biggest drop since 2022 with financial technology companies being some of the biggest losers. These companies included stock trading apps and cryptocurrency exchanges, which suffered due to a drop in Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin declined by nearly 5%, continuing a downward trend. The leading cryptocurrency has fallen 19% over the past month.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Cheap Technology Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Worst Performing Crypto Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nBeyond crypto, other fintech sectors like online lenders and payments companies also suffered. These companies also declined more than the broader market.\n\nFintech analysts point to declining consumer confidence as a potential challenge, especially for companies that rely on consumer spending. In February, the Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index fell to 98.3, falling by nearly 7%. This decline marked the largest monthly drop since August 2021. According to CNBC, analysts noted that while fintech companies had performed relatively well since the election, sentiment has recently turned sour due to declining consumer confidence and signs of slowing discretionary spending.\n\nThe current fintech sell-off came after a strong rally in the fourth quarter of 2024, which was driven by expectations of Fed rate cuts and hopes for a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration.\n\nDespite a challenging time, fintech companies continue to invest in new technologies. This is leading to significant innovation and disruption in financial services. Additionally, recent declines could present a buying opportunity as certain fintech companies are setting themselves to perform well in the future.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 20 best fintech stocks to buy according to billionaires, we looked for the biggest fintech companies. We reviewed our own rankings, financial media reports, ETFs, and various online resources to compile a list of the best fintech stocks. Next, we focused on the top 20 fintech stocks most favored by billionaires. Data for the number of billionaire investors for each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database. Finally, the 20 best fintech stocks to buy were ranked in ascending order based on the number of billionaires holding stakes in them as of Q4 2024.",

MTN reported a R9.59 billion ($526 million) net loss for 2024, exceeding analyst expectations of R3.87 billion, largely due to currency devaluation in key markets.\n\nThe naira\u2019s depreciation had a particularly severe impact, with MTN Nigeria\u2019s pre-tax loss widening by more than 200% to N550.3 billion ($355.76 million).\n\nDespite these financial setbacks, Mupita expressed confidence in a turnaround. \u201cThat pain which we\u2019ve had for 18 months is abating somewhat,\u201d he said during a media call. \u201cThe business is growing very strongly. So I\u2019m actually very bullish and confident that we\u2019ll see strong recovery in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nTo manage financial pressures, MTN has implemented cost-saving measures, cutting 3.8 billion rand in expenses, including 1.2 billion from renegotiated tower leases, according to Chief Financial Officer Tsholofelo Molefe.\n\nThe telco also declared a final dividend of R3.45 per share for 2024, surpassing market expectations, with plans to increase it to at least R3.70 per share for 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN has implemented tariff hikes on voice and data services, possibly aligning with broader industry adjustments to rising operational costs and economic volatility.\n\nBeyond fintech, MTN is exploring network-sharing agreements, a common strategy in European markets, to optimize infrastructure costs. With Mastercard\u2019s investment pending final approvals, the success of the fintech spinoff, particularly in Nigeria, will be critical to MTN\u2019s long-term strategy and financial recovery.",

Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 and 2026 EPS has dropped by 8 cents and a penny, respectively.\n\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDuring the past month, shares of Mastercard have declined 7.2% compared with the industry\u2019s and the S&P 500 Index\u2019s declines of 7.9% and 8.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, peers like Visa Inc. V and American Express AXP were down 7% and 15.1%, respectively.\n\nPrice Performance \u2013 MA, V, AXP, Industry & S&P 500 Index\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShould you capitalize on Mastercard's recent dip? Let\u2019s examine its operations, valuation and risks to make an informed decision.\n\nMastercard\u2019s Operations Continue to Grow\n\nMA\u2019s gross dollar volume (GDV) increased 8.1% in 2024, following 10.3% growth in 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 GDV indicates around 7% year-over-year growth. So, while the company is still expected to witness growth, the degree is expected to moderate.\n\nSimilarly, switched transactions increased 13.9% in 2023 and 11.3% in 2024. The consensus estimate for 2025 for the metric signals around a 10% year-over-year rise.\n\nThe company is investing heavily to meet the growing demand for its service offerings like cybersecurity and data analytics, facilitating its diversification efforts. In 2024, value-added services generated $10.8 billion, up 16.8% year over year, thanks to increasing demand for consumer acquisition, engagement, and business and market insights. Our model estimate suggests nearly 14% growth in 2025.\n\nMastercard's expansion in emerging markets, especially in Southeast Asia and Latin America, supports its long-term growth strategy. These efforts help offset revenue losses from its Russia exit while tapping into a vast, underbanked population. However, its massive international exposure could pose some risks due to geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nThe shift toward digital payments remains a major growth driver. As cash usage declines, Mastercard is leveraging its global network and expanding its service offerings to stay ahead. Its strong cash reserves enable organic growth and strategic acquisitions, ensuring continued expansion. Investments in AI, fraud prevention and digital solutions further solidify its leadership in the payments industry.\n\nMastercard\u2019s Valuation is not Cheap\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Mastercard is trading at a forward P/E ratio of 32.08X, higher than its five-year median of 31.75X and well above the industry average of 22.78X. In comparison, Visa trades at 27.74X and American Express at 16.84X. Mastercard\u2019s premium valuation raises overvaluation concerns.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 10 Stocks & Says President Trump Should Be Like Steve McQueen. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to discuss President Trump and his tariffs. The market wiped out $4 trillion in value since its peak following the election on Monday and Cramer commented on the selloff on Tuesday. Throughout the show, he maintained that the President had to fine-tune his messaging for the tariffs. Recalling President Herbert Hoover, Cramer stated:\n\n\u201cI mean look the President said tariffs are going to be the greatest thing we have ever done as a country. Well I mean remember, Smoot-Hawley, 1930, Hoover. Right. Greatest things gonna happen to our country. 32\u2032, election, wishes he hadn\u2019t said that. Wants to walk it back. Lost by a mile.\u201d\n\nOne President whose approach Cramer believes that Trump should consider following is Ronald Raegan. Imploring that \u2018meanness\u2019 is not an American value, he shared:\n\n\u201cI love Raegan so, Raegan spoke softly. Look when you look back at the 1980s as being a halcyon period in retrospect. Raegan did it with a happy warrior smile. I don\u2019t see any smile here. I see meanness. America don\u2019t like meanness. That\u2019s not our country. Meanness. We\u2019re not meanness. Be more like Steve McQueen. Who was great. He\u2019s like. . .Robert Vaughn. Don\u2019t give me Robert Vaughn. Give me Yul Brynner.\u201d\n\nThe conversation then shifted to markets. While the NASDAQ bled 4% during the day, Cramer shared that Trump prefers to refer to the Dow index as his preferred stock market indicator:\n\n\u201cRight I mean obviously the Dow Jones is not down as much as the NASDAQ. And it is the Dow Jones. It\u2019s always been the Dow Jones with the President. Which is fine. Very meaningful. I do wanna point out that he was more constructive about the idea of linking himself to the market than he is now. Because when he said that you can\u2019t really watch the stock market that\u2019s a little bit of a pivot from what we heard.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC TV show host also believes that stock market losses and Trump\u2019s tariff narrative could alienate the President\u2019s working-class base. According to him:\n\n\u201cThe stock market\u2019s a decent referendum because everybody sees it. And by the way, the people, the base has a 401(k) and the base has a, they have an IRA. And the base doesn\u2019t wanna lose money. The base works really hard for the IRA to get that up. And this is the IRA under attack. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with sending stocks down if companies are doing badly and we\u2019ve heard from a couple, Verizon, we\u2019ve heard some of the airlines. We are in conference season so you\u2019re hearing companies say negative things. \u201cAt the same time, why be part of that? Why tip things? And the answer is this that I think that the President in this moment wants to get something done with the tariffs. But tariffs are really hard for the base to understand. They\u2019re hard for me to understand. I studied economics. I studied with Gailbraith for heaven\u2019s sake. They\u2019re really good people. All Nobel guys. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard. And I think that it\u2019s better to say listen we\u2019re gonna work quietly to get things better for you working people but if you\u2019re opening a factory in our country while you\u2019re causing people to be laid off now, there\u2019s a considerable gap between laid off now and when the factory can open. Particularly when you\u2019re building very, very difficult foundries. They take four, five years to build. So I think that this is a good moment to be able to say look, we\u2019ve established kind of a roadmap here and you\u2019re not going to necessarily hear what we\u2019re gonna do. But we\u2019re doing it for you. . .it\u2019s the message.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on March 11th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 181\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a financial services provider that dominates the US market. As with its smaller rival Mastercard, the firm\u2019s business depends on consumer spending and economic output. It is also facing competition from fintech upstarts and retailer prickliness to transaction fees. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)\u2019s shares are up by 5% year-to-date and have gained 16.5% over the past year. Some of the tepid performance has been attributed to an antitrust lawsuit that the firm is facing. Here is what Cramer said about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V):\n\n\u201cWatch fintech. Fintech bottoms before actual fin. Fintech is like the best place to be, you know Mastercard is a travel, travel related company. I would watch that. I would watch Visa. Another travel related company. Because those have been part of the cohort. If they can overcome travel and the Affirms of the world can overcome the buy-now-pay-later, you\u2019re gonna see a rally. You will see a rally. \u201c\n\nOverall, V ranks 9th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of V as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than V but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

They state, \u201cEvery U.S. resident qualifies, no exceptions.\u201d Users are directed to \u201ctap the link below\u201d and answer a simple survey to claim their money.\n\nThe caption accompanying the video reads, \u201cThis new Giveback scheme won\u2019t last. Claim it now before it\u2019s gone for good.\u201d The post has been shared more than 200 times in just two weeks, spreading the misinformation further.\n\nFact Check: No Such Stimulus Payment Exists\n\nOur verdict: False There is no evidence to support the claims made in the video. Congress has not approved any such payment, and the website linked in the post is not affiliated with the U.S. government.\n\nNo New Stimulus Payments Since 2021\n\nFederal lawmakers have not passed any recent legislation authorizing a $1,000 stimulus payment for all U.S. residents. In fact, the last round of stimulus payments occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than three years ago.\n\nThe most recent stimulus payment was part of the American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in March 2021. It provided $1,400 per individual or $2,800 per married couple.\n\nPrevious rounds of stimulus payments occurred during former President Donald Trump\u2019s first term:\n\nIn March 2020, a $1,200 payment was approved for individuals earning less than $75,000 annually.\n\nIn December 2020, a second payment of $600 per individual was distributed.\n\nSince then, no further direct relief payments have been authorized by Congress or announced by the Treasury Department or IRS.\n\nMisleading Website and Survey Tactics\n\nThe Facebook post links to a non-governmental website that requests users to provide personal information under the guise of entering a \u201ccontest\u201d to win $1,000. This is a red flag. Legitimate stimulus payments are distributed based on eligibility criteria, not through contests or surveys. Sharing personal details on such sites may lead to identity theft or other scams.\n\nTrump Video Taken Out of Context\n\nThe video uses footage of former President Trump from an Oct. 31 campaign rally in New Mexico. However, his speech during that event makes no mention of a new stimulus payment, further discrediting the post\u2019s claims.\n\nProtecting Yourself from Misinformation\n\nTo avoid falling for scams like this, remember:\n\nOfficial government announcements will only be shared through verified channels, such as Treasury Department or IRS statements.\n\nGovernment websites always end with .gov\u2014avoid links leading to unverified third-party sites.\n\nBe wary of any claims promising financial benefits in exchange for personal information or survey participation.\n\nBy staying vigilant and verifying information through credible sources, individuals can protect themselves from misinformation and potential scams.",

(NYSE: V) is highlighted as a key player in global commerce, demonstrating resilience against fintech competitors and high transaction fees.\n\nVisa\u2019s shares rose by 16.5% over the last year, attracting significant interest from hedge fund investors by late 2024.\n\nCramer predicts a potential market rally, with travel-related companies like Visa and Mastercard poised for a strong rebound.\n\nDespite competitive pressures, Visa\u2019s adaptability and global reach enable it to thrive, not just survive.\n\nWhile Visa remains a top stock pick, Cramer sees enticing opportunities in AI-focused equities with rapid innovation prospects.\n\nThe overarching message emphasizes Visa\u2019s stability and lasting confidence amid market fluctuations.\n\nIn a tumultuous world swirling with geopolitical tensions and financial uncertainties, finding clarity in the market can often feel like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands. Yet, for those keen on navigating the financial ether, Jim Cramer\u2019s insights offer a guiding light. His recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk on the Street\u201d brings forward a perspective not just on stocks, but on leadership and economic resilience.\n\nImagine an economic battlefield, where President Trump\u2019s fiery rhetoric clashed with the cool-headed legacy of past leaders. Cramer, a seasoned market whisperer, draws parallels to the days of President Herbert Hoover\u2019s Smoot-Hawley Tariff, a historical echo of caution against protectionist fervor. He mused on a need for a suave, Steve McQueen-like composure, advocating a shift towards a more congenial, Reagan-esque leadership style\u2014one that emphasizes strength with a smile.\n\nAmid this backdrop of high-stakes politicking, the stock market dances to its own tune. And in this waltz of indexes, Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) stands tall. Often flying under the radar, Visa, alongside its perennial compatriot Mastercard, forms the backbone of global commerce. Despite facing stiff competition from nimble fintech challengers and disgruntled retailers balking at transaction fees, Visa remains resilient. Its shares, observed by 181 hedge fund investors in the last quarter of 2024, have managed a 16.5% climb over the past year.\n\nCramer\u2019s analysis highlights how the market may soon shift focus. He hints at an impending rally, imagining a future where travel-related companies like Visa and Mastercard rebound mightily. The essence of his prediction lies in the belief that payments giants can weather the travel slowdowns and the competitive onslaught from buy-now-pay-later schemes.\n\nBut perhaps the more striking aspect is the cautious optimism around fintech\u2019s pivotal role. Visa\u2019s evolution is not just about surviving; it\u2019s about thriving amidst transition. As technological disruptors churn the waters, Visa remains steadfast\u2014banking on its adaptability and global reach.\n\nHowever, Cramer\u2019s take is not devoid of skepticism. While Visa edges closer to the top of his stock picks, he hints at even greater opportunities lying with AI-focused equities, where rapid innovation beckons more immediate returns.\n\nIn essence, the key takeaway from Cramer\u2019s narrative is how a venerable powerhouse like Visa can still be a bastion of stability amidst technological and political upheaval. For the discerning investor, the message is clear: amidst the noise of the market, the quiet confidence of a household name often proves the most resounding.\n\nThe Stock Market Secrets Jim Cramer Wants You to Know\n\nIn the ever-shifting landscape of global finance, Jim Cramer\u2019s expertise offers a beacon of insight.

SBCA solicits consent from the small business client to leverage data-driven insights to help assess the company\u2019s financial performance. SBCA leverages business performance data to help lenders evaluate key questions about a small business\u2019s financial health.\n\nWith SBCA integrated into its embedded financing tool, CredibleX will be able to help make more informed lending decisions, reduce underwriting time, and enhance risk management. \u201cThis partnership with CredibleX underscores Mastercard\u2019s commitment to supporting the SME ecosystem in the UAE,\u201d said Mastercard EVP of Services in EEMEA Selin Bahadirli. \u201cSBCA is a game-changer, offering unparalleled insights into small business performance. Together, we aim to empower SMEs with better credit access, improved loan terms, and enhanced opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nAdding enhanced data will also help CredibleX improve access to credit across the EMEA region. Because Mastercard\u2019s SBCA will offer CredibleX a more comprehensive evaluation of a business\u2019s financial health, it will also drive financial inclusion for small businesses with previously limited access to working capital because of their limited credit history or lack of formal documentation.\n\n\u201cThis partnership is a testament to our shared vision of enabling financial inclusion and innovation,\u201d said CredibleX Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer Hassan Reda. \u201cBy combining CredibleX\u2019s expertise in lending with Mastercard\u2019s advanced analytics, we are setting a new benchmark for data driven SME financing in the region.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2023, CredibleX offers embedded insurance, embedded invoice finance, embedded POS finance, and B2B channel finance tools. The solutions help any organization that services SMB customers to add lending solutions under their brand. CredibleX raised $55 million in funding last December from Further Ventures.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Mastercard Inc. MA, T-Mobile US, Inc. TMUS, Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras PBR and Where Food Comes From, Inc. WFCF.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Mastercard, T-Mobile and Petroleo Brasileiro\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Mastercard Inc., T-Mobile US, Inc. and Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras, as well as a micro-cap stock Where Food Comes From, Inc.. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.\n\n\n\nYou can read today's AWS here >>> PPI Wholesale & Jobless Claims Both Lower\n\n\n\nToday's Featured Research Reports\n\n\n\nShares of Mastercard have gained +11% over the past year against the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry's gain of +13.9%. The company's acquisitions are helping it to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. It expects low-double-digit net revenue growth in 1Q25.\n\n\n\nThe accelerated adoption of digital and contactless solutions is providing an opportunity for its business to expedite its shift to the digital mode. Strong cash flow supports its growth initiatives and enables shareholder value-boosting efforts through repurchases and dividends. But, its dividend yield is lower than the industry average.\n\n\n\nGrowing operations will likely support a future rebound of MA's shares. Steep operating expenses might stress its margins in the future. The Zacks analyst expect adjusted operating costs to jump 13% in 2025. High rebates and incentives may weigh on net revenues. Also, the stock is overvalued than the industry.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here >>>)\n\n\n\nT-Mobile's shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+58.0% vs. +41.5%). The company is benefiting from industry-leading postpaid customer growth with a record-low churn rate. Its acquisition strategy has significantly strengthened its position in the wireless industry over the past few years.\n\n\n\nTMUS' 2.5 GHz 5G spectrum delivers superfast speeds and extensive coverage with signals that go through walls and trees. This boosts its competitive edge against companies that provide 5G networks controlled by the mmWave spectrum. Solid growth in free cash flow accentuates efficient capital management.\n\n\n\nHowever, owing to the stock's premium valuation, we believe investors should remain cautious as macroeconomic factors, market saturation, or economic downturns can significantly impact overvalued stocks like TMUS. Fierce competition is straining profitability. The high debt burden remains a major concern.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on T-Mobile here >>>)\n\n\n\nPetroleo Brasileiro's shares have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-3.1% vs. +1.9%). The company is exposed to significant exposure to the volatile Brazilian real, and currency risk. Having said all of this, Petrobras is still reeling under huge debt burden cannot be overlooked.\n\n\n\nBeing a state-controlled entity, Petrobras also faces political and regulatory uncertainties. As such, Petrobras warrants a cautious stance at the moment. Nevertheless, Brazil's state-run oil and natural gas giant Petrobras is riding high on the back of its impressive portfolio, particularly in the country's pre-salt reservoirs.\n\n\n\nIt is the operator in most of these areas and holds interests in them ranging from 20% to 100%. This puts Petrobras in an enviable position to maintain an impressive production growth profile for years to come. Meanwhile, Petrobras is investing in renewable diesel and low-carbon projects, though its energy transition lags behind peers.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Petroleo Brasileiro here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Where Food Comes From have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Services - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (-5.8% vs. -0.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $59.41million is facing risks which include cattle industry contraction, stagnant core revenue growth, rising SG&A expenses, reliance on Bitcoin-related gains and increasing competition in verification markets. Regulatory shifts and industry cyclicality add uncertainty to long-term growth.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Where Food Comes From maintains a strong gross margin (41.9% in 2024 versus 43.4% in 2023) despite inflationary pressures, supported by bundled verification services and expansion into high-margin sustainability audits.\n\n\n\nThe company's recurring revenue model (79.8% of 2024 sales) ensures stability, with high customer retention among more than 17,500 producers. A strong cash flow and a debt-free balance sheet enable strategic reinvestment and share buybacks (273,057 shares repurchased in 2024). Regulatory tailwinds, ESG demand and industry-leading accreditation provide competitive advantages.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Where Food Comes From here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

            "content": "Dublin, March 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"B2B Digital Payment - Global Strategic Business Report\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global market for B2B Digital Payment was valued at US$4.6 Billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$57.6 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 52.6% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increasing adoption of digital wallets, virtual cards, and blockchain-based payment platforms has further enhanced the B2B payment landscape. These technologies enable secure, cross-border transactions at lower costs, addressing long-standing challenges associated with traditional payment methods. Furthermore, the shift towards cloud-based solutions allows for scalability and easy access, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) looking to modernize their payment infrastructure. As businesses increasingly prioritize operational efficiency and security, digital payment solutions are becoming integral to the transformation of B2B financial processes.\n\nWhat Factors are Driving the Growth of the B2B Digital Payment Market?\n\n\n\nThe growth in the B2B digital payment market is driven by several factors, including the increasing digitization of financial processes, the expansion of cross-border trade, and evolving consumer expectations for faster and more secure transactions. The growing adoption of e-commerce in the B2B sector has also played a pivotal role in accelerating the shift to digital payments, as businesses require solutions that can integrate seamlessly with online platforms. Advancements in payment technologies, such as AI-driven fraud detection and blockchain, are further enhancing the security and efficiency of digital payment systems.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the rising focus on sustainability and reducing paper-based processes is encouraging businesses to adopt digital payment methods that align with their environmental goals. Regulatory mandates, such as those promoting transparency in financial transactions, are also fostering the adoption of digital solutions. Consumer behavior is another critical driver, as businesses seek to meet the expectations of tech-savvy stakeholders who demand convenience and real-time capabilities. Collectively, these factors are shaping the future of B2B transactions, positioning digital payments as a cornerstone of modern business operations.\n\nWhy is Cross-Border Trade Driving Demand for Digital Payments?\n\n\n\nThe rise of cross-border trade has been a significant catalyst for the adoption of B2B digital payments. As businesses expand globally, the need for efficient, cost-effective payment solutions that can handle multiple currencies and jurisdictions has become paramount. Digital platforms address these complexities by offering faster settlements, transparent fee structures, and compliance with international regulatory standards. Blockchain technology, in particular, is gaining traction for its ability to facilitate secure and instantaneous cross-border transactions without relying on intermediaries.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, digital payment solutions are empowering exporters and importers to mitigate risks associated with currency fluctuations through features like real-time currency conversion and dynamic pricing. These capabilities enhance trust and collaboration between trading partners, fostering smoother international transactions. The growing importance of e-commerce in the B2B space has also amplified the demand for digital payment solutions that can integrate seamlessly with online marketplaces and support diverse payment methods. This alignment of technology with the needs of global trade is driving the rapid adoption of digital payments across borders.\n\n\n\nHow are Enterprises Benefiting from Digital Payment Integration?\n\n\n\nEnterprises across industries are reaping significant benefits from integrating digital payment systems into their financial workflows. For large organizations, these solutions provide centralized platforms for managing multiple payment channels, reducing the complexity associated with handling diverse supplier networks. Digital payments also enhance vendor relationships by ensuring timely and accurate payments, which are critical for maintaining trust and collaboration. Furthermore, features such as automated invoicing and reconciliation help businesses reduce administrative overheads and focus on core operations.\n\n\n\nFor SMEs, digital payment platforms offer accessibility and scalability, enabling them to compete with larger enterprises on a global scale. These systems often include value-added services like analytics and credit facilities, empowering small businesses to optimize their financial strategies. The ability to integrate digital payments with other business tools, such as customer relationship management (CRM) and accounting software, further enhances operational efficiency. As enterprises increasingly recognize these advantages, the demand for robust and versatile digital payment solutions continues to grow.\n\nReport Features:\n\nComprehensive Market Data: Independent analysis of annual sales and market forecasts in US$ Million from 2024 to 2030.\n\nIn-Depth Regional Analysis: Detailed insights into key markets, including the U.S., China, Japan, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East, and Africa.\n\nCompany Profiles: Coverage of players such as ACI Worldwide, Inc., Adyen, BharatPe, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

            "content": "In a significant legal decision, Visa and MasterCard have agreed to a $200 million class action settlement following allegations of imposing unlawful ATM withdrawal fees. The lawsuit, covering transactions from 2007 to 2024, accused financial corporations of engaging in anti-competitive practices that led to inflated ATM surcharges. This outcome is a major win for consumers who excessive cash withdrawal charges have long burdened.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed that Visa and MasterCard collaborated with major banks to manipulate ATM fees, preventing competition from lowering costs. These actions were deemed a violation of antitrust laws, ultimately resulting in unfair financial burdens for millions of users. As part of the settlement, eligible individuals can claim refunds of up to $2,000, depending on their ATM transaction history.\n\nThis ruling provides financial relief to affected consumers and sets a precedent for stricter regulations on ATM fees and increased transparency within the banking sector. The case underscores the growing scrutiny of financial institutions engaging in monopolistic practices that hinder fair competition.\n\nWhat was Visa and MasterCard ATM Fee Lawsuit?\n\nThe class action lawsuit emerged from allegations that Visa and MasterCard imposed restrictive rules on ATM operators, prohibiting them from offering lower fees to customers using alternative payment networks. These restrictions ensured that high surcharges remained in place, benefiting the companies and affiliated banks while increasing consumer costs.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2024, the lawsuit gained momentum as customers and advocacy groups called for greater transparency in ATM fee structures. The claimants argued that Visa and MasterCard engaged in anti-competitive behaviour, preventing a fair market from naturally reducing ATM withdrawal charges over time.\n\nSettlement Breakdown and Refund Process\n\nThe $200 million settlement is allocated between the two financial giants as follows:\n\nVisa: Responsible for $104.6 million\n\nResponsible for $104.6 million MasterCard: Responsible for $92.8 million\n\nThis settlement fund will be used to compensate affected individuals who were charged excessive ATM fees. Eligible consumers who used ATMs between 2007 and 2024 can apply for refunds of up to $2,000, depending on the number of transactions and fees incurred.\n\nHow Refunds Will Be Calculated\n\nThe refund amount each claimant receives will depend on several factors:\n\nThe total ATM surcharge fees paid between 2007 and 2024.\n\nThe number of valid claims submitted.\n\nThe available settlement pool of $200 million.\n\nRefunds will be distributed proportionally if the total claims exceed the settlement fund. Consumers who pay higher ATM fees will likely receive larger refunds, whereas those with lower claims will receive a percentage of their requested amount.\n\nIndividuals must submit a claim form and supporting documentation to claim a refund, such as bank statements or ATM receipts. The claims administrator will assess all applications, and payments will be issued via direct deposit or mailed checks once the claims are verified. It is recommended that claimants file early to ensure eligibility and maximize their potential refund.\n\nSteps to Claim a Refund\n\nConsumers who were subjected to excessive ATM surcharges during the covered period can submit a claim through the following process:\n\nComplete an official claim form \u2013 Available on the Settlement Website or via mail submission. Evidence of ATM transactions \u2013 This can include bank statements, ATM receipts, or account records indicating surcharge fees. Submit before the deadline \u2013 Claim forms must be submitted before the official deadline to be considered for compensation.\n\nThe court-appointed claims administrator handling the case will provide further details regarding deadlines and fund distribution.\n\nCourt\u2019s Ruling and Consumer Impact\n\nThe court ruled that Visa and MasterCard violated consumer rights by enforcing non-competitive ATM withdrawal fees without proper transparency. This ruling carries several key implications:\n\nLegal Precedent: Establishes stronger legal scrutiny on financial institutions imposing hidden fees.\n\nEstablishes stronger legal scrutiny on financial institutions imposing hidden fees. Promotes Market Competition: Encourages fair pricing practices, preventing monopolistic control over ATM surcharges.\n\nEncourages fair pricing practices, preventing monopolistic control over ATM surcharges. Direct Consumer Benefits: Affected individuals will receive refunds, providing financial relief.\n\nAffected individuals will receive refunds, providing financial relief. Increased Transparency: The ruling may lead to stricter regulations on ATM fee disclosures, ensuring customers have clear information before withdrawing cash.\n\nFuture Implications for Financial Institutions\n\nThis landmark case is expected to influence the broader banking sector, particularly in regulating and structuring ATM fees. Some possible long-term effects include:\n\nStronger Regulatory Oversight \u2013 Authorities may introduce stricter rules requiring transparent disclosure of ATM fees to prevent similar legal disputes in the future.\n\n\u2013 Authorities may introduce stricter rules requiring transparent disclosure of ATM fees to prevent similar legal disputes in the future. Changes to ATM Fee Structures \u2013 Visa and MasterCard may modify their surcharge policies to avoid further litigation.\n\n\u2013 Visa and MasterCard may modify their surcharge policies to avoid further litigation. Potential for More Consumer Lawsuits \u2013 This case could encourage additional lawsuits against financial institutions imposing hidden fees on customers.\n\nThe $200 million class action settlement against Visa and MasterCard is a significant milestone in the fight for consumer rights and financial transparency. The lawsuit has held these payment giants accountable for their actions by exposing anti-competitive practices that led to inflated ATM fees.\n\nConsumers affected by these excessive charges should take advantage of the settlement claims process to recover their refunds. This case also serves as a warning to financial institutions, reinforcing the necessity of fair competition, clear fee disclosures, and enhanced consumer protection measures in the banking industry.",

The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

The company\u2019s acquisitions are helping it to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. It expects low-double-digit net revenue growth in 1Q25.\n\n\n\nThe accelerated adoption of digital and contactless solutions is providing an opportunity for its business to expedite its shift to the digital mode. Strong cash flow supports its growth initiatives and enables shareholder value-boosting efforts through repurchases and dividends. But, its dividend yield is lower than the industry average.\n\n\n\nGrowing operations will likely support a future rebound of MA\u2019s shares. Steep operating expenses might stress its margins in the future. The Zacks analyst expect adjusted operating costs to jump 13% in 2025. High rebates and incentives may weigh on net revenues. Also, the stock is overvalued than the industry.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here >>>)\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+58.0% vs. +41.5%).

Its acquisition strategy has significantly strengthened its position in the wireless industry over the past few years.\n\n\n\nTMUS\u2019 2.5 GHz 5G spectrum delivers superfast speeds and extensive coverage with signals that go through walls and trees. This boosts its competitive edge against companies that provide 5G networks controlled by the mmWave spectrum. Solid growth in free cash flow accentuates efficient capital management.\n\n\n\nHowever, owing to the stock\u2019s premium valuation, we believe investors should remain cautious as macroeconomic factors, market saturation, or economic downturns can significantly impact overvalued stocks like TMUS. Fierce competition is straining profitability. The high debt burden remains a major concern.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on T-Mobile here >>>)\n\n\n\nPetroleo Brasileiro\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-3.1% vs. +1.9%). The company is exposed to significant exposure to the volatile Brazilian real, and currency risk. Having said all of this, Petrobras is still reeling under huge debt burden cannot be overlooked.\n\n\n\nBeing a state-controlled entity, Petrobras also faces political and regulatory uncertainties. As such, Petrobras warrants a cautious stance at the moment. Nevertheless, Brazil's state-run oil and natural gas giant Petrobras is riding high on the back of its impressive portfolio, particularly in the country\u2019s pre-salt reservoirs.\n\n\n\nIt is the operator in most of these areas and holds interests in them ranging from 20% to 100%. This puts Petrobras in an enviable position to maintain an impressive production growth profile for years to come. Meanwhile, Petrobras is investing in renewable diesel and low-carbon projects, though its energy transition lags behind peers.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Petroleo Brasileiro here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Where Food Comes From have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Services - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (-5.8% vs. -0.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $59.41million is facing risks which include cattle industry contraction, stagnant core revenue growth, rising SG&A expenses, reliance on Bitcoin-related gains and increasing competition in verification markets. Regulatory shifts and industry cyclicality add uncertainty to long-term growth.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Where Food Comes From maintains a strong gross margin (41.9% in 2024 versus 43.4% in 2023) despite inflationary pressures, supported by bundled verification services and expansion into high-margin sustainability audits.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s recurring revenue model (79.8% of 2024 sales) ensures stability, with high customer retention among more than 17,500 producers. A strong cash flow and a debt-free balance sheet enable strategic reinvestment and share buybacks (273,057 shares repurchased in 2024).

            "content": "about In Tech In Tech is our regular feature highlighting what people are talking about in the world of technology \u2014 everything from crypto and NFTs to smart cities and cybersecurity.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that artificial intelligence has been the buzzword of the past few years, grabbing headlines and taking centerstage. But it\u2019s not just tech giants implementing AI into business practices \u2014 it\u2019s slowly been changing the way Hollywood operates, too.\n\nFrom digital replicas potentially replacing actors to AI-driven personalized content and immersive viewing experiences, AI is reshaping Hollywood by changing how movies are both made and experienced. While pushing creative boundaries, it also raises concerns about job security and authenticity, prompting the industry to balance innovation with protecting human creativity.\n\nAI\u2019s casting call\n\nWhen you imagine Hollywood actors and their lives, you probably think of A-listers like Emma Stone or Leonardo DiCaprio living a life of complete luxury. However, that\u2019s not the reality for most people working in the industry. SAG-AFTRA\u2019s union rate is only $187 a day for background actors, a stark difference to what movie leads make.\n\nThe use of AI to replace background actors or extras was brought into the spotlight in the summer of 2023 when SAG-AFTRA went on strike to fight for better pay and workers\u2019 rights.\n\nReports started to circulate that background actors on sets were being required to report to trailers that had hundreds of cameras inside, all there to take 3D body scans. From there, their digital replicas were created and could potentially be used in other films or scenes without the actor\u2019s consent or potentially without additional pay. In some cases, if the extra declined the request, they were sent home without pay, Variety reported. This caused deep worry within the community as thousands of people became concerned that AI was coming for their jobs.\n\nAfter months of striking, the union agreed to a contract that established protections for actors against AI replacement, particularly for background performers. The agreement introduced rules for two types of \"digital replicas:\" those created with the performer's participation and those generated independently using existing materials. Both require explicit, informed consent, with separate approvals needed for uses beyond the original production.\n\nThe contract also prevents digital replicas from replacing background actors and mandates negotiations for AI-generated \"synthetic performers.\" These measures work to ensure fair compensation and safeguard actors' rights as AI technology evolves, but the situation continues to raise important questions about how AI will affect all kinds of jobs, including perhaps once unexpected positions like background actors.\n\nCritically acclaimed AI\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the 2025 award season has been filled with enough drama to create a movie of its own. From resurfaced mean tweets to the lack of an intimacy coordinator on one set, there was plenty to talk about. One topic stood out from the other issues, as it has not been a concern or relevant question in the past \u2014 does AI have a place in critically acclaimed films?\n\nBoth Netflix\u2019s \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and A24\u2019s \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d dominated award nominations this year. While the recognition by voting groups came as no surprise to many, controversy swirled when it was revealed that the software company Respeecher was used in both films to alter different actors\u2019 voices.\n\nThe use of AI in the production of \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d was first revealed in May during an interview with the film\u2019s sound mixer, Cyril Holtz, at the Cannes International Film Festival. Holtz revealed that the team worked with Respeecher to implement voice cloning techniques, working to enhance the vocal range of the film\u2019s lead character, played by Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n. To improve her range, Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s voice was blended with Camille\u2019s, a French singer and co-writer of the film\u2019s music.\n\nDuring awards campaigning season, the controversy surrounding the use of AI in \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d surfaced after editor D\u00e1vid Jancs\u00f3 discussed the film\u2019s use of Respeecher technology in an interview. AI was used to improve the Hungarian dialect spoken by stars Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones, particularly to fine-tune the difficult accent. While production initially tried using traditional automated dialogue replacement to resolve the issue, but it didn\u2019t work, leading them to explore AI options.\n\nThe film\u2019s director Brady Corbet quickly defended the use of AI, clarifying that it was only employed for refining the Hungarian dialogue to preserve the authenticity of the actors' performances, not to replace them.\n\nWhile the use of AI in both films did not prevent them from winning major awards this season, the discussion about the integrity of actors' performances when AI is involved remains a hot topic in the industry, as technology continues to evolve and be utilized in various ways.\n\nAt the heart of every film are the people \u2014 the actors, creatives and writers who bring stories to life. While AI brings exciting advancements to Hollywood, the industry will likely continue grappling with how to use the technology to ensure it maintains the core of the cinematic experience: the human touch.",

This includes employees that supported its portfolio companies on product, technology, marketing and growth, human resources, and business development, according to three senior company officials who attended the meeting who spoke to Rest of World.\n\n\u201cThe Mastercard Foundation remains committed to its Young Africa Works strategy to see 30 million young people, especially young women, access dignified and fulfilling work by 2030.\u201d Daniel Hailu, executive director of pan-African programs at the Mastercard Foundation, told Rest of World in a statement.\n\nThe announcement follows a decline in African startups securing investments over $100,000 in 2024. 54 Collective was the only investor involved in more than 20 financing deals of over $100,000 last year. The other top two investors who had previously made the list in 2023, 2022, and 2021 were Techstars and Launch Africa.\n\n54 Collective and Mastercard Foundation\n\nHeadquartered in South Africa, 54 Collective was founded in 2018 and has invested in over 70 startups. The firm merges venture studio and venture capital models by giving early-stage founders in Africa investment and mentorship, and working with large organizations and impact investment firms to fulfill its services. Some of the company\u2019s partners include South Africa\u2019s Standard Bank, South African health-care company Netcare, and the Dublin-headquartered Small Foundation.\n\nIt gained its most significant funding in August 2023, when the Mastercard Foundation and Johnson & Johnson Impact Ventures pledged to invest $114 million in the VC firm to expand its \u201cunconventional VC model\u201d and better support founders across Africa. Over five years, the firm received $20 million per year from the Mastercard Foundation.\n\nIn an email, the company told Rest of World that the Mastercard Foundation funding was pivotal to its business. Even though senior executives said the company will likely cut its core investment team across its offices in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, 54 Collective shared it will continue to invest as usual.\n\nImage: Adedoyin",

Concerns of risk of failure (31%), lack of financial resource (29%) and lack of experience (28%) are the top barriers cited by women who have not yet started their own business. Women in Europe are also more likely than men to say lack of confidence is a hurdle (21% vs. 18% of men). This gap is particularly noticeable among Gen Z (25% of women vs. 21% of men) and millennials (26% of women vs. 18% of men).\n\nWomen who have already founded a business also say they struggle disproportionately with caring responsibilities and work-life balance, with women founders more likely than men to say caring commitments were a challenge when starting their business (15% vs. 11%). Women entrepreneurs are also more likely than men to say they struggle to switch off from work on holidays (48% vs. 42%), find it harder to balance childcare (35% vs. 33%) and skip holidays for business (36% vs. 29%).\n\nAddressing the confidence gap\n\nTraining on how to develop a business plan (21%), and more widely available and accessible grants for small businesses (21%), are the top two things that would make women in Europe more confident in starting their own business.\n\nYounger women are also more likely than older generations to feel they\u2019d benefit from a support network, with 30% of Gen Z women saying having a business partner would make them more confident - the number one factor for this generation. Access to a mentor (24%) also scored higher than access to grants (20%) for Gen Z women.\n\nBeatrice Cornacchia, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Communications for Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, Europe at Mastercard, said: \u201cThis research highlights the remarkable entrepreneurial spirit among women across Europe, particularly within younger generations.\n\n\u201cDespite the progress made by women entrepreneurs, the findings also underscore the challenges that still exist. These barriers emphasize the need to provide them with the support they need to succeed. At Mastercard, we are committed to building an inclusive digital economy and equipping small businesses with the tools and opportunities they need to grow and thrive.\u201d\n\nAcross Europe, Mastercard is spearheading initiatives that support entrepreneurs and their business. This includes Mastercard Strive in the EU, which has awarded grants of up to \u20ac500k to innovative organizations supporting micro and small business growth across the EU, and Mastercard Strive in the UK which has reached more than one million small UK businesses, more than half of which are led by women.\n\nFor more information about Mastercard initiatives to support small businesses see Small & Medium Business Solutions | Mastercard Payment Solutions\n\nMethodology\n\nThe study was commissioned by Mastercard, with fieldwork conducted by independent research agency, Opinium.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Visa Inc. V, Mastercard Inc. MA, American Express Co. AXP and Discover Financial Services DFS.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nVisa vs. Mastercard: Which Payments Giant Makes the Better Stock to Buy Now?\n\nThe Battle of Payment Titans\n\nVisa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. dominate the payments industry, benefiting from the ongoing global shift toward digital transactions. While they share similar strengths, each has distinct advantages and challenges. With market caps of $641.5 billion (Visa) and $498.5 billion (Mastercard), they form a powerful duopoly, which is often scrutinized by regulators.\n\nCompetitors like American Express Co. and Discover Financial Services continue expanding their networks but remain far behind these two industry leaders. So, which stock offers the better investment opportunity today? Let's start by examining the risks.\n\nRegulatory Challenges: A Growing Concern\n\nBoth Visa and Mastercard are under increased regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the United States and the U.K. The Credit Card Competition Act of 2023 aims to curb their dominance by increasing competition and reducing merchant costs. However, given the current administration's business-friendly stance, any immediate impact seems unlikely.\n\nIn the U.K., the Payment Systems Regulator is considering fee caps and transparency measures after merchant fees soared, costing businesses an extra \u00a3170 million annually. Additionally, Mastercard was linked to nine unlicensed sites recently and Visa to two, leading to substantial consumer losses. While these challenges could somewhat pressure profitability, both companies maintain strong operational footholds.\n\nStrong Operations Drive Growth\n\nVisa's emphasis on technological innovation is evident in products like Visa Token Service, Visa Checkout and Visa In-App Provisioning. The company is also capitalizing on emerging payment trends, including Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL), crypto, and fintech partnerships. Contactless payments (Tap to Pay) now account for more than 80% of global in-person transactions. However, it anticipates adjusted operating expenses to witness high single-digit to low double-digit growth in fiscal 2025.\n\nMastercard, on the other hand, has strengthened its business through cybersecurity, data analytics and value-added services. Revenues from these segments grew 17.7% in 2023 and 16.8% in 2024. Mastercard's digital expansion in Southeast Asia and Latin America fuels long-term growth but also introduces additional geopolitical risks. Notably, the company expects adjusted operating expenses to see low-teens growth in 2025.",

            "content": "In 2021, Lerato Matsio was thrilled to receive her first order for the silk loungewear brand she was selling online as a passion project from her home in Belgium.\n\nAs she prepared the order for dispatch, she took a few moments to slip a handwritten thank-you note inside the box holding the carefully wrapped sand-washed silk lounge set, which she then sent by FedEx to her maiden customer. All of which made her more upset when the buyer said the parcel had never arrived and requested a refund.\n\nWhen she learned that the buyer\u2019s husband had signed the delivery note, it began to dawn on her: Matsio had fallen victim to what\u2019s known as friendly fraud,\u201d a scam in which people demand refunds under false pretenses \u2014 and one that is growing fast in the e-commerce sector in particular.\n\nIt was not the first time she had experienced fraud that year. Fraudsters had racked up multiple charges on her credit card in her home country of South Africa. So she decided to fight back.\n\nDelving into the world of retail fraud, she quickly found that merchants and banks faced a blind spot. They had no way to access real-time information on fraudsters, who could be anyone from individuals testing their luck to syndicates brandishing burner phones and synthetic identities.\n\nAlways resourceful with her time, Matsio spent her maternity leave conceptualizing a solution to help plug the estimated $100 billion annual loss from friendly fraud, which can include claims that deliveries have been stolen by \u201cporch pirates\u201d or phony chargebacks over disputed subscription fees.\n\nIn fact, research by digital ID firm Socure shows that a third of Americans admit to committing friendly fraud, also called first-party fraud, themselves, with Gen Z consumers the biggest culprits.\n\nThe plan she dreamed up while nursing her newborn son eventually evolved into Trudenty\u2019s Consumer Trust Network, which preserves consumer data privacy while letting companies share fraud risk data to pinpoint fraudsters. And not only that. \u201cWe\u2019re also helping companies really know when they are dealing with a genuine, trusted customer, so that they can service them better,\u201d Matsio says. For example, a more reliable customer might be offered instant refunds or more payment options, such as the ability to pay later.\n\nWhen her maternity leave ended, Matsio decided to move on from her career at McKinsey, where she had enjoyed seven years and had her sights set on becoming partner, to focus on building her data-sharing network. The Techstars Berlin accelerator program accepted her in 2022. She was fine-tuning her concept when payments provider Worldline shared the opportunity with her to build a solution to combat rising return and refund fraud.\n\nTrudenty, which Matsio developed along with co-founder Samruddhi Bhangale, now allows its customers to share data via privacy-preserving technologies (including data hashing and ephemeral data processing). And through its machine learning algorithms, the platform produces \u201csignals\u201d that spot trends in consumers\u2019 activity that other customers can use to determine risk.\n\n\u201cWe pull it all together into a 360-degree view of how consumers behave across the entire ecosystem,\u201d Matsio says.\n\nRetailers, banks and card issuers can use the consumer intelligence in Trudenty\u2019s Consumer Trust Index to make informed decisions, in real time, about how they interact with customers to reduce losses and time-consuming investigations while improving experiences for trusted consumers. For example, a bank may refuse to issue cards to high-risk customers. Or a retailer may opt to ask certain buyers to collect from a depot rather than have items delivered.\n\nWith growing momentum, London-based Trudenty is testing its technology with customers in France and the U.K. and plans to expand to Brazil and the U.S. It recently joined Mastercard\u2019s Start Path startup engagement program to focus on scaling up by connecting with more companies to weed out fraudsters and improve experiences for reliable customers. The company is also exploring the integration of Mastercard products and services to provide enhanced signals on consumer behavior.\n\nTo Matsio, eliminating the consumer visibility gap will ultimately result in a safer commerce and payments environment \u2014 a virtue she appreciates as both a consumer and a business owner.",

            "content": "At a time when brands are expected to be more than just businesses, Mastercard has emerged as a global leader in purpose-driven innovation. Raja Rajamannar, the company\u2019s Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, is at the helm of this transformation, whose approach transcends traditional marketing metrics to focus on societal impact, technological advancement, and authentic consumer connections. I had the opportunity to sit down with Raja to discuss how Mastercard is leveraging its vast resources to support displaced families, empower small businesses with AI, and redefine the experience economy. Our conversation delved into the evolving role of the CMO, the integration of sustainability into business strategy, and how passion and purpose can coexist not just as buzzwords, but as the foundation for lasting global impact. Whether it\u2019s through initiatives like the \u201cWhere to Settle\u201d campaign for Ukrainian refugees or pioneering AI tools for entrepreneurs, Raja\u2019s vision is clear: innovation without purpose is just noise. Here\u2019s how Mastercard is making sure its impact resonates far beyond the balance sheet.\n\nCosta: Mastercard has launched initiatives like the \u201cWhere to Settle\u201d campaign for Ukrainian refugees and the Small Business AI tool in the U.S. How do you determine which social challenges to prioritize, and what role does purpose play in your personal leadership philosophy?\n\nRajamannar: We\u2019re focused on ensuring that every person and family can thrive in the digital economy. That North Star charts the course for our business but is also the guiding light for our purpose-led initiatives, allowing us to do well as we do good in a sustainable, authentic, and real way. You see this reflected in our products and services, partnerships, and campaigns.\n\nFor instance, when we saw a need to support displaced families in the early days of the Ukrainian refugee crisis, we launched \u201cWhere to Settle.\u201d Leveraging our expertise in digital payments, financial inclusion and global networks, we provided practical solutions that directly addressed their needs. It was good for people, good for the community, and good for our brand. Similarly, with the Small Business AI tool piloting in the U.S., we\u2019re empowering small businesses by giving them access to AI tools, hoping to enable them to grow even further.\n\nI firmly believe, personally and professionally, that it\u2019s critical to have a North Star that keeps you consistent and enables greater trust to be built\u2014whether between employees or consumers and brands. It also creates accountability that allows for greater, longer-term impact. People sometimes act like making purpose profitable is something you need to whisper about, but I say it loudly. If brand purpose isn\u2019t authentic, it will fall flat and unintentionally harm existing consumer relationships. When you passionately pursue your purpose, profit follows.\n\nYou\u2019ve spoken extensively about the shift toward experiential and multisensory marketing. How do you align these innovations with the company\u2019s mission to connect people to their passions and purposes?\n\nConsumers are increasingly seeking memorable experiences, plain and simple. Research shows a clear shift toward prioritizing experiences over things. People are spending more on their passions and consciously saving to fuel them, which drives economic activity across categories like travel, music, and sports \u2014 a phenomenon we call Passionomics. Understanding this shift, we\u2019ve leaned into these insights and are seeing incredible results.\n\nFrom expanding our restaurants globally, including Peak by Priceless in New York City, to offering special access through our partnership with McLaren Racing, and collaborating with Netflix to deliver immersive experiences like Netflix House and Netflix Bites, these are just a few examples of how we\u2019re creating unforgettable moments that connect our cardholders to their passions.\n\nYour Small Business AI tool demonstrates Mastercard\u2019s commitment to inclusive mentorship. How do you see AI evolving to bridge gaps in equity and opportunity further globally?\n\nSmall businesses are the backbone of our economy. When small businesses thrive, we all thrive. Through our work with entrepreneurs, we\u2019ve identified a significant gap in access to essential resources, particularly mentorship. A 2024 U.S. Small Business Administration survey found that more than 90% of small- and medium-sized business owners believe mentorship improves their chances of success, yet only 25% have a mentor. While AI can never replace human mentorship, this insight inspired us to focus on developing tools that help bridge this gap.\n\nOur Small Business AI chatbot offers ongoing guidance to entrepreneurs at every stage of their journey, providing access to diverse, responsible sources of content whenever needed. AI is powerful because it helps level the playing field, acting as an enabler for success.\n\nLooking ahead, AI-driven consumer applications will become more mainstream and accessible, continually evolving and improving to help consumers in highly specific ways, tailored to their personalized needs. This will further empower entrepreneurs and small businesses.\n\nUrban mobility campaigns promote sustainable solutions like public transportation. How does sustainability factor into Mastercard\u2019s strategy, and how do you engage consumers in these efforts?\n\nPublic transportation is a win in so many ways: it makes cities more efficient, reduces congestion, and helps the environment. We\u2019re focused on creating seamless and inclusive transit experiences that encourage the use of digital payments and make sustainable travel more accessible.\n\nThrough contactless payments for trains, buses, bikes, and scooters, we\u2019re making public transport easier and more secure to use. But it\u2019s not just about convenience\u2014we also want to make it fun and engaging. With campaigns like \u201cTap, Go & Play,\u201d we\u2019re gamifying the experience, offering incentives to encourage people to ride more often. By doing this, we\u2019re helping make public transport a regular habit while supporting more sustainable travel.\n\nYour partnership with McLaren unlocks unique experiences for fans. How do these collaborations deepen Mastercard\u2019s connection with consumers, and what\u2019s next for sports and experiential marketing?\n\nOur partnership with McLaren Racing perfectly exemplifies our experiential brand strategy. By aligning with an iconic team like McLaren and in a sport that\u2019s skyrocketing in popularity, we\u2019re creating extraordinary opportunities for fans worldwide.\n\nWhether we\u2019re unlocking unique, behind-the-scenes moments by giving fans special access to tickets or the team garage, meeting the drivers, or hearing an incredible artist while at a race, we\u2019re unlocking unique, behind-the-scenes moments. These experiences help build an emotional bridge between fans and Mastercard, showcasing that we\u2019re not just a payments company but a brand that understands and invests in what people care about.\n\nAs we look to the future, we\u2019re committed to staying ahead of the curve, exploring opportunities across sports, culinary and other cultural arenas to connect with consumers wherever their passions lie. For example, gaming is one of the fastest-growing passions worldwide, with a massive, dedicated fanbase. Seeing this, we recognized a clear opportunity. We became the first global sponsor of League of Legends in 2018. Since then, we\u2019ve expanded our partnerships to include Valorant and launched programs like the Mastercard Gamer Academy. This initiative takes a group of dedicated individuals from around the world, offering training, travel and unique experiences that help them turn their passion into a career focused on the game they love.\n\nWhat does our motto \u201cworth beyond wealth\u201d mean to you?\n\nTo me, \u201cworth beyond wealth\u201d is a powerful reminder that true success isn\u2019t measured solely by financial gain but by the positive impact we can create in the lives of others. This aligns deeply with Mastercard\u2019s philosophy of doing well by doing good, using our resources, technology and partnerships to make a meaningful difference. It\u2019s a call to focus on what truly matters.",

Despite this gap, over 50% of merchants proactively requested technical upgrades, signaling that larger retailers with deeper knowledge of the payments ecosystem are pushing for innovations.\n\nMastercard is stepping in to bridge the gap between merchants and PSPs, ensuring that the demand for seamless checkout experiences is met with responsive solutions.\n\nThe Role of PSPs and Industry Collaboration\n\nWhile it exists in a separate hemisphere, Australia mirrors Brazil in its push for digital payment advancements but faces its own unique challenges, particularly around security.\n\nFernando said the country has one of the highest rates of contactless payments globally, with 99% of transactions being contactless and 70% happening on mobile devices. However, the online checkout experience remains inconsistent, creating friction for both consumers and merchants.\n\n\u201cOur online experience is still broken in many ways,\u201d Fernando said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing high demand for one-click checkout, but what really surprised me was the growing interest in biometric authentication. With only 1 in 10 transactions authenticated in Australia, we have a billion-dollar card fraud problem that needs urgent attention.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized the role of PSPs in solving this issue.\n\n\u201cWhile more than 52% of merchants didn\u2019t engage with their PSPs on technology requests, it\u2019s clear that those who did saw significant improvements in approval rates and fraud mitigation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to create a system where merchants feel empowered to ask for these capabilities.\u201d\n\nOne of the major advancements in Australia is the integration of Click to Pay, a streamlined checkout experience that eliminates the need for manual entry and increases conversion rates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working with issuers to auto-enable customers into Click to Pay, which dramatically improves adoption,\u201d Fernando said. \u201cThis, combined with network tokenization and biometric authentication, forms the holy trinity of secure, seamless checkout.\u201d\n\nLooking Ahead to the Future of Checkout Innovation\n\nBoth Sousa and Fernando agreed that PSPs play a crucial role in the adoption of new payment technologies, but they need better education on their value.\n\n\u201cWe need to articulate the \u2018why\u2019 \u2014 why network tokenization reduces fraud, why Click to Pay increases conversion, and why biometric authentication is the future,\u201d said Fernando. \u201cOur vision is clear: 100% tokenized transactions, 100% authentication and the elimination of manual card entry by 2030.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe industry has to come together to make this happen,\u201d Sousa said. \u201cJust as we collectively deployed contactless technology a few years ago, we must now rally around one-click checkout, tokenization and passkeys.\u201d\n\nAs consumer expectations continue to evolve, merchants, PSPs and issuers must align their strategies to prioritize both security and user experience. Ultimately, whether in Brazil, Australia or elsewhere, the future of checkout is fast, frictionless and fortified against fraud. And if Mastercard\u2019s latest initiatives are any indication, the payments industry is well on its way to achieving that future.",

            "content": "Tap and go \u2014 also known as contactless payments \u2014 account for more than two in every three in-person transactions globally on Mastercard\u2019s network, up from one in three prior to the pandemic . That spike in adoption can be attributed to two major factors. First, shoppers and merchants were both seeking touch-free ways to transact amid the global pandemic. Second, the launch of tap to ride on major mass transit systems around the world became a killer app for contactless and propelled usage.\n\nFor a payment technology that\u2019s been around for more than 20 years, it\u2019s safe to say that contactless has officially arrived.\n\n2. relating to or being a technological system (as for making payments) where information is transmitted (as by near field communication) without physical contact\n\nContactless technology is also helping businesses of all sizes adapt to the digital economy, with the help of innovations like Tap on Phone, which turns a merchant\u2019s smartphone into a digital cash register. It\u2019s also powering a host of other capabilities, such as instantly provisioning a card into a mobile wallet, verifying a transaction or sending money to friends and family, all with just a tap.\n\nMany of us may take the concept of contactless for granted today because of how widely it\u2019s been adopted, but it\u2019s safe to say that this technology has sparked one of the biggest changes in consumer payments habits \u2014 perhaps in decades. Before contactless went mainstream, swiping your card at a terminal, or, later, dipping your card was the main way to pay.\n\nCurious about contactless? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about tap and go.\n\nWhat are contactless payments?\n\nContactless payments are simple, fast, secure and touch-free ways to pay in person using a payment card, mobile wallet or payment-enabled wearable, like a smartwatch or fitness tracker. With tap and go, you simply tap or hold your card or device on the merchant\u2019s payments reader to complete the transaction.\n\nHow does tap and go work?\n\nTap and go works quickly and seamlessly today thanks to an innovation dating back decades: radio frequency identification, or RFID, a technology that uses radio waves to transfer data. The idea was born during World War II as a way to detect whether approaching planes were friends or foes.\n\nToday\u2019s cards typically use a version of RFID called near-field communication, or NFC, which operates at a higher frequency and allows for faster data transfer, but only at close distances \u2014 a few inches. Payment cards, mobile wallets and other wearables contain a tiny antenna that relays the account information to the merchant terminal.\n\nHow do I know if my card is contactless?\n\nYou know your payment card is contactless if it has the contactless indicator \u2014 four curved lines \u2014 printed somewhere on it. Most cards issued today by major banks are contactless by default, while cards with magnetic stripes for swiping are slowly being phased out entirely.\n\nAny mobile wallet is capable of making contactless payments.\n\nHow do I know where contactless payments are accepted?\n\nContactless payments are accepted where you see the contactless payments symbol \u2014 the same indicator with a circle around them and a hand holding a card \u2014 on the merchant\u2019s electronic payment terminal, device or card reader or on signage near the front door or checkout. The payment terminal may also simply say \u201ctap, swipe or insert card\u201d to pay, indicating that contactless payments are available.\n\nThough consumers are increasingly embracing tap and go, some merchants have been slower to implement contactless payments because they believe it will be costly to replace their point-of-sale hardware.\n\nBut there are low-cost alternatives: The same technology that turns your smartphone into a payment device can also turn a merchant\u2019s smartphone into an acceptance device. With Tap on Phone, no additional hardware is required, only an app. Customers simply hold their contactless card or phone near the merchant\u2019s phone to make the payment.\n\nTap on Phone, currently live in more than 115 markets around the world, was initially targeted to small businesses and micro-merchants \u2014 tens of millions of whom were cash only \u2014 and mobile businesses, like food trucks, but larger retailers are also embracing it to reduce lines at registers. In 2024, the number of Tap on Phone locations more than doubled.\n\nHow do I set up and tap and go?\n\nTap and go is automatic with a contactless-enabled payment card. With a smartphone, you must first add your card to your phone\u2019s wallet app. Open the app and follow instructions for adding your card. Typically, that means inputting your name, card number, expiration date and security code.\n\nOnce your bank verifies the information, which should take seconds, it will be added to your wallet. You can add multiple cards to your wallet but designate one as your default.\n\nHow do I make a contactless payment?\n\nYou make a contactless payment by tapping the part of your card with the contactless indicator on or near the part of the merchant\u2019s card reader or point-of-sale device emblazoned with the contactless symbol.\n\nWith a mobile wallet, you simply open the wallet app and tap the phone as you would the card. Tap technology doesn\u2019t actually require a tap \u2014 you just have to hold your card or phone within an inch or two of the reader to make the payment.\n\nIf you accidentally tap more than once, you won\u2019t be charged twice. And there\u2019s minimal risk of prematurely paying for your purchase because the merchant terminal must be queued for the sale and your card or device must be within a couple of inches to make a payment.\n\nAre contactless payments safe?\n\nContactless payments are safe. When you tap to pay, your card or device never leaves your hand, reducing the risk of loss and eliminating the need for physical contact, which was important during the pandemic.\n\nWhen you pay with a contactless card, the embedded EMV chip encrypts your account information so your data can\u2019t be stolen. When you pay with your smartphone, the card stored in your mobile wallet is also tokenized, meaning the number on your card has been replaced with a random number, so the merchant never sees or stores your actual account information, lowering the risk of your information being stolen in case of a data breach.\n\nContactless transactions with your phone are also secured by the biometrics required to authenticate yourself on your device \u2014 your fingerprint or Face ID \u2014 and cryptograms, or one-time codes that are generated for every transaction.\n\nHow else is contactless technolo gy being de ployed ?\n\nContactless technology is making digital commerce faster, safer and simpler in several ways. With Tap to Add\u200b, you can tap your card on your phone to provision it into your mobile wallet or store it on file with a merchant\u2019s app or e-commerce wallet. Tap to Activate eliminates the need for calling your bank or going to an ATM to activate your new or reissued card.\n\nTap to Verify confirms you\u2019re in possession of your card when using your mobile wallet, bank app or merchant app, delivering more peace of mind without requiring email verification or one-time passcodes. Tap to Pay replicates the easy of in-store tapping with e-commerce: If you\u2019re shopping online, you can tap your card against your phone to complete your transaction, without having to type in your card information, and you can also save your card on file for future purchases. With Tap to Send or Receive, you can simply tap your card or mobile phone against someone else\u2019s to complete the transaction for peer-to-peer payment \u2014 no need to search for their handle or type in their name.\n\nThis story was originally published June 17, 2024.

Michael Bruemmer, vice president of Experian Global Data Breach Resolution and Consumer Protection, outlined several warning signs, including: Unrecognized charges to your credit card or bank account\n\nUnexpected credit checks on your report\n\nReceiving unfamiliar bills\n\nA sudden drop in your credit score \"All of these could be red flags that someone is using your identity,\" he warned, adding that early detection can help minimize the damage.\n\nIf you're facing financial challenges, many credit card companies offer hardship programs designed to provide temporary relief.\n\nThese usually offer lower rates of interest and lower monthly payments.\n\nDealing with debt is never easy, so it's crucial that you explore your wider options.\n\nFor example, there are debt forgiveness programs that negotiate on your behalf with your creditors.\n\nOne of the ways to get a better sense of your debt is to create a management program through a counseling agency.\n\nWhen using a program like this, you make one monthly payment to the credit counseling agency.\n\nThe agency then disburses funds to your creditors.",

As the soft Florida light gently bathes the freshly manicured grass and casts a golden glow over the empty grandstands, an electric sense of anticipation fills the air as PGA Tour professionals warmup on the green. The 2025 Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard isn\u2019t just a celebration of world-class golf\u2014it\u2019s an invitation into a realm of accessibility, authenticity, and truly priceless experiences.\n\nThis year, Mastercard took the tournament beyond the fairways by bringing in a dynamic group of content creators to capture these moments in real time. From inside-the-ropes access to one-on-one interviews with the pros, these creators gave their audiences a perspective they wouldn\u2019t otherwise get\u2014an unfiltered, behind-the-scenes look at what makes this event so special. Whether it was the nerves of stepping onto the first tee, the excitement of playing alongside golf\u2019s biggest names, or the cutting-edge innovations happening off the course, Mastercard empowered these creators to share the essence of the Arnold Palmer Invitational like never before.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making the sport more relevant and aspirational for a new generation of fans,\u201d says Raja Rajamannar, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer at Mastercard. \u201cOur goal is to bring people closer to their passions and what truly matters to them. By introducing fresh perspectives and dynamic experiences that feel more natural and welcoming, we\u2019re breaking down barriers and hope to inspire the next generation to see golf as a sport they can truly connect with.\u201d\n\nThe Creator Experience: Bringing Fans Inside the Ropes\n\nAt the heart of Mastercard\u2019s commitment to innovation and accessibility was its exclusive access for digital creators during the Arnold Palmer Invitational and I had the rare chance to tee up alongside PGA TOUR professionals in the Pro-Am alongside Tyler Webb a sports business content creator, Carlee Shoemaker a co-owner of Eze Aim Golf, and Matthew Haag better known as Nadeshot and CEO of 100 Thieves. This experience gave us an inside look at what it\u2019s like to play Bay Hill in tournament-ready conditions, where firm greens, deep rough, and challenging pin placements made the course even more demanding than expected. It was an eye-opening experience that deepened our appreciation for the skill required to compete at such a high level.\n\nFor Shoemaker, this experience proved to be one of a kind. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful for the opportunity, not just as a golf fan, but as a creator,\u201d she told Variety. \u201cMy goal is always to bring my audience closer to the game in a way that feels real, relatable, genuine. Being able to give my community an inside-the-rope experience was really cool. It\u2019s not something that a lot of fans get to see, so I wanted to capture what that felt like. Like my nerves on the first tee, some conversations I had with the pros, Corey Connors helped me read greens and get lines off the tee, so that was just really something that was cool to share.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, this is just a really cool opportunity to be able to get on the ground and behind the ropes for a kind of experience that I don\u2019t always have access to from my office,\u201d added Webb. \u201cExperiencing the product they\u2019re selling, the event they\u2019re putting on\u2026 It was such an enjoyable experience.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the on-course experience, Mastercard set up a Creator Studio where we had the chance to ask the pros fan-submitted questions via social media, giving followers a unique opportunity to hear directly from their favorite golfers. Set against the backdrop of the driving range, this exclusive area provided creators with the opportunity to interview PGA Tour pros like Billy Horschel and Viktor Hovland, as well as golf legends like Annika Sorenstam and Curtis Strange.\n\nSupporting Small Business: A Community-Driven Celebration\n\nMastercard\u2019s commitment to small businesses goes beyond digital creators to include supporting local Orlando-based entrepreneurs. At the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Mastercard provided small businesses like Seven Bites and Stemma with exclusive retail spots on the course. This unique opportunity allowed them to showcase their offerings to a wider audience, giving fans a taste of Orlando\u2019s authentic culture and craftsmanship and elevating their presence in ways traditional retail couldn\u2019t achieve. This effort highlights the brand\u2019s dedication to fostering innovation and lasting relationships that benefit both businesses and the communities they serve.\n\n\u201cSmall business is the backbone to the economy of any country,\u201d said Rajamannar. \u201cGuess what? One out of four small businesses are actually creators. So you cannot grow this small business segment without addressing the growing segment of creators.\u201d\n\nThis year, Mastercard also partnered with streetwear brand 9dcc to offer exclusive, limited-edition clothing, each piece embedded with a chip that links to a digital collectible. They also introduced an AI-powered Smart Mirror, allowing fans to virtually try on the apparel before purchasing, creating a new and innovative shopping experience.\n\nA New Chapter in Fan Engagement\n\nBy working with brand partners like Mastercard, the PGA Tour is hoping to engage both lifelong fans and newcomers, with every moment at the event designed to be engaging and accessible.\n\n\u201cGolf isn\u2019t just for a traditional audience anymore \u2013 we\u2019re seeing it attract a younger and wider range of fans \u2013 whether through social media, affinity toward specific players, or interest in the culture of the sport,\u201d said Rajamannar. \u201cBecause of this, we\u2019re meeting them where they are by creating immersive and engaging experiences that make golf more accessible and exciting.\u201d\n\nMastercard is extending this approach to other sports as well, including F1, soccer, cricket, tennis, baseball, and more, creating immersive and engaging experiences that connect fans with the action in new and exciting ways.\n\n\u201cThis (creator experience) is what we want to take everywhere, wherever we have got the space available, wherever we have the availability of the ambassadors and the creators,\u201d said Rajamannar. \u201cIn each (sport) we try to go deep and bring people close in terms of experiences that they go have, truly priceless, truly memorable.\u201d",

            "content": "Akshay Bhatia just got off the golf course where he struggled to break 80, and it\u2019s going to be a hell of a fight just to make the cut the next day. Not too many golfers would be in the mood to fulfill media obligations in such a scenario, but the 23-year-old\u2019s perspective on the game is a breath of fresh air. He\u2019s making his first-ever appearance at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. And as it so happens, it\u2019s also his debut bout in the ring as a Mastercard ambassador. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve made it,\u201d is Bhatia\u2019s reaction to seeing his face displayed on tournament billboards around the course. It\u2019s a justified sentiment given his world number 30 ranking and two TOUR victories in the same number of full seasons.\n\nBut this week isn\u2019t about Akshay, and he knows that. It\u2019s about honoring the legacy of a great champion and an even better role model: Arnold Palmer. In a day and age where conversations on social media shape the narrative around beloved sporting idols, examining the legacy of Mr. Palmer (as he\u2019s fondly referred to by today\u2019s players) feels especially relevant. Arnie lived in a time when documenting every minutiae of one\u2019s day was simply not possible, yet he forged such a strong connection with his fans that may never be equaled.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Akshay Bhatia (@akshaybhatia_1)\n\nRelating the 1950s to the present day is akin to comparing apples and oranges. The wider point is that in today\u2019s digital landscape of media-savvy professional golfers and golfing-savvy content creators, Bhatia, born more than 70 years after Palmer, is keenly aware of The King\u2019s lasting influence. He\u2019s being interviewed by us in the Mastercard Creator Studio, a space that the credit card company curated to connect its ambassadors like Curtis Strange, Annika Sorenstam and Bhatia with online voices such as Matthew Haag, Carlee Shoemaker and Tyler Webb. And yet, he speaks with a grounded appreciation for what he\u2019s achieved and those who came before him to create the opportunity to compete for millions.\n\nTrying to match Palmer\u2019s competitive accomplishments may be a fool\u2019s errand, but it feels as if the young professional (who has already won twice on the PGA TOUR) is doing his small part to build on Arnie\u2019s legacy. That is, competing at a very high level, taking the time to connect with fans and media, and doing it all with a ton of humility, grace and perspective.\n\n1 of 3 2 of 3 3 of 3\n\nThis is your first appearance with Mastercard and your first time playing the Arnold Palmer Invitational. So what is it like to see the presence that they have here knowing that you represent the brand?\n\nIt\u2019s amazing. Obviously this tournament is so iconic and to be an ambassador for Mastercard is really cool. And for them to sponsor such an amazing event that\u2019s been around for such a long time and really carries on Arnold Palmer\u2019s legacy, it\u2019s really cool. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve really had a partner like this where I see my face on some of the grandstands. So I\u2019m really excited for the relationship that we will build.\n\nWhat\u2019s your reaction when you see your face on those grandstands?\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve made it, honestly. No, I think it\u2019s just really cool to have more exposure through such a great partnership. And so I look forward to hopefully coming back here for a long time and representing Mastercard really well. And it\u2019d be really cool to win this event one day.\n\nDo you feel like the way that you made it through mini tours, the Korn Ferry Tour and really earned your place here gives you a stronger appreciation for your successes so far?\n\nYeah, I mean, it obviously makes me the person I am today, grinding all the time and just taking it step by step. This game can come at you really fast. It took me a little bit of time, but now it feels like a light year since I won my first mini tour event. So it\u2019s always fun to continue to learn and build and to look back and see where I\u2019m at today versus a couple years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of an extrovert\u2026I feed off of people\u2019s energy and support.\u201d\n\nYou mentioned the legacy of Arnold Palmer. Did you get to meet him?\n\nNo, I was too young to honestly really know him. But obviously I watched him tee up at Augusta every year hitting the opening tee shots. And being from Wake Forest, North Carolina, there\u2019s a statue in the town and I played the golf course he grew up playing a handful of times. It\u2019s just an old municipal kind of course with crabgrass greens, but it\u2019s so different and so fun. He had a lot of swag and a presence to him that I think a lot of people don\u2019t realize now. But he had a big impact on the game of golf.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting here in this Mastercard Creator Studio. Have you ever seen something like this at a PGA TOUR event?\n\nNot really. I mean, this is really cool. It feels like I\u2019m doing the Weather Channel or something. But, yeah it\u2019s a pretty cool setup. I mean I love creating content and I enjoy the social media side. It\u2019s a big part of my life. And so anytime I get a chance to show everyone who I am or things that people want to know is a big win.\n\nDo you think of it as a responsibility or a privilege that people want to know you better? How do you build your following while prioritizing your game?\n\nYou have to find balance. But, you know, I just really enjoy it. I love interacting with people. I\u2019m kind of an extrovert, I guess. I feed off of people\u2019s energy and support, so I just enjoy it. I enjoy making kids smile. People wait all day for me so I try my best to give back. I\u2019m very fortunate for the platform I have, and hopefully it can continue to build.",

            "content": "If you\u2019re into earning travel rewards through premium credit cards, you probably receive a ton of mail from issuers trying to convince you to apply for the latest travel card.\n\nPremium credit cards are known for having enhanced benefits \u2014 and high annual fees. But the perks can\u2019t be overstated: hotel elite status, elevated earnings, airport lounge access, and more.\n\nI thought I\u2019d heard of them all until I recently received a mailer for Luxury Card. I hadn\u2019t heard of it, unlike the dozens of mailers I received each month for credit cards \u2014 often with hefty welcome bonus offers.\n\nI wasn\u2019t too familiar with the card and program before receiving the mailer, so I did some digging into both to see whether the cards are worth the annual fees and how they stack up compared to other premium cards currently available on the market.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to cover about Luxury Card, so with that being said, let\u2019s dive right in!\n\nWhat Is Luxury Card?\n\nBilled as a \u201cglobal leader\u201d in the premium credit card market, Luxury Card is a Mastercard product that allows you to earn points that you can redeem for airfare and statement credits. It also offers some travel benefits and redemptions, though we\u2019ll talk more in-depth about these later.\n\nUnderneath the Luxury Card umbrella are 3 separate cards \u2014 Mastercard\u00ae Gold Card\u2122, Mastercard\u00ae Black Card\u2122, and Mastercard\u00ae Titanium Card\u2122.\n\nOne of Luxury Card\u2019s selling points is not just the perks or value of the card but the actual make and design of the physical card. You\u2019ll find references to the cards\u2019 material all over the site \u2014 there\u2019s even an entire page on the website dedicated to the card\u2019s construction and how much it weighs.\n\nBut, if you\u2019re curious, the Mastercard Gold card comes wrapped in 24k gold-plated stainless steel, the Mastercard Black card is black PVD-coated stainless steel, and the Mastercard Titanium card is brushed stainless steel.\n\nLuxury Card says its cards are accepted at more than 8 million domestic retailers in 210 countries, with no foreign transaction fees.\n\nLuxury Card Annual Fees\n\nAs mentioned above, there are 3 different cards, all offering different benefits. As such, all have varying annual fees. The card with the highest fee \u2014 the Mastercard Gold card \u2014 will set you back nearly $1,000 in annual fees. That\u2019s more expensive than even The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express, which is $695 annually (rates & fees) and one-fifth the price of the exclusive (and elusive) Centurion\u00ae Card from American Express, which is said to have a $5,000 yearly fee.\n\nWith those details in mind, let\u2019s take a look at how much a Luxury Card will cost you yearly, depending on which card you choose:\n\nMastercard Gold Card: $995 annual fee ($295 for each authorized user)\n\nMastercard Black Card: $495 annual fee ($195 for each authorized user)\n\nMastercard Titanium Card: $195 annual fee ($95 for each authorized user)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarning and Redeeming Points With Luxury Card\n\nDining out with all Luxury Card options earns 1x points for every $1 spent. Image Credit: Luxury Card\n\nLuxury Card offers many of the benefits that premium cards, such as The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express, Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae, and Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, provide. Where it falls short, however, is in its earning structure.\n\nRegardless of which Luxury Card you select, you\u2019ll earn 1x points for every $1 you spend. That\u2019s a pretty low bonus rate, especially when considering other premium cards:\n\nAmex Platinum Card: 5x points on flights booked directly with airlines or with AmexTravel.com (up to $500,000 spent per year, then 1x) and prepaid hotels through AmexTravel.com\n\n5x points on flights booked directly with airlines or with AmexTravel.com (up to $500,000 spent per year, then 1x) and prepaid hotels through AmexTravel.com Chase Sapphire Reserve Card : 5x points on airfare booked via the Chase Travel portal; 3x points on all other travel and dining purchases\n\n: 5x points on airfare booked via the Chase Travel portal; 3x points on all other travel and dining purchases Capital One Venture X Card: 5x on travel bookings made through Capital One Travel and 2x on all other eligible purchases\n\nLuxury Card offers 2% value for airfare redemptions \u2013 meaning 50,000 points will get you a $1,000 airline ticket. That comes to a value of 2 cents per point, similar to our valuations for other flexible loyalty programs. However, other programs like Amex Membership Rewards or Chase Ultimate Rewards allow you to transfer flexible points to travel partners to book business or first class award travel or luxury hotel stays. In some instances, you can get a redemption value of up to 10 cents per point with these partners.\n\nIf you prefer to redeem Luxury Card points for cash, you\u2019ll receive a value of up to 2% cash-back \u2014 1% for the Mastercard Titanium card, 1.5% for the Mastercard Black card, and 2% for the Mastercard Gold card. This can either be deposited into your bank account or used as a statement credit. But unlike other cards, you can\u2019t turn the cash-back into transferable rewards because Luxury Card has no transfer partners.\n\nLuxury Card Benefits\n\nNow let\u2019s take an in-depth look at the benefits you\u2019ll receive with each card:\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE Mastercard Gold Card Mastercard Black Card Mastercard Titanium Card Annual Fee $995 $495 $195 Earning Potential Earn 1x points for every $1 you spend Value for Airfare Redemptions 2% Value for Cash-Back Redemptions 2% 1.5% 1% Annual Airline Credit Toward Qualifying Airline Purchases $200 $100 N/A Global Entry Application Fee Credit $120 N/A Priority Pass Select Membership $100 N/A\n\nBottom Line: As you\u2019ll see, there\u2019s virtually no difference between the Mastercard Gold card and the Mastercard Black card. The latter offers 1.5% cash-back instead of 2%. But the perks significantly roll back if you have the Mastercard Titanium card, which offers virtually no travel benefits outside of cash-back or airfare redemptions.\n\nTravel Benefits\n\nWith Luxury Card, you find some of the same benefits as other premium cards.

Luxury Card offers some decent benefits, but the annual fees, especially for the Mastercard Black card and Mastercard Gold card, will be a hard pill to swallow for many travelers.\n\nThere are some decent benefits, like the travel concierge and Luxury Card Travel program, that can get you discounted rates and benefits at thousands of properties. Similar benefits come with other premium cards, but it\u2019s nice to see a new player offer similar perks.\n\nOne of the most significant offsets to having a high-annual-fee premium card is being able to transfer those points \u2014 be it Amex, Capital One, Chase, or Citi \u2014 to an airline or hotel partner, which can give you outsized value. Unlike other premium credit cards, Luxury Card doesn\u2019t partner with hotel or airline loyalty programs, which means you won\u2019t be able to earn points through the program and then transfer them to a partner. And while you can redeem points earned from the cards for airfare, it doesn\u2019t appear that you\u2019re able to do the same for hotel stays, which is something that many high-end credit cards offer.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, you won\u2019t receive any hotel elite status with Luxury Card like you would when holding the Amex Business Platinum card or Amex Platinum card, both of which offer complimentary Hilton and Marriott elite status (enrollment required).\n\nYou do have access to the Priority Pass network and TSA PreCheck or Global Entry statement credits with the Mastercard Gold card and Mastercard Black card, but again, these are perks that come standard with many premium travel rewards cards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuxury Card Alternatives\n\nIf you decide against Luxury Card \u2014 or decide that you want several premium cards in your wallet \u2014 there are several alternatives offering immeasurable benefits. Let\u2019s take a look at a few:\n\nHot Tip: Check out our detailed comparison of the Mastercard Black card vs. the Amex Platinum card.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nLuxury Card makes sense if you want a cool credit card that will make your friends\u2019 eyes go wide. But that\u2019s pretty much where the draw ends. It has some decent benefits like a travel concierge and travel discounts. Still, the high annual fee on the premium cards and the limited benefits on the lower-tier card makes it difficult to justify opening it.",

Credit : Shutterstock, Markus Mainka\n\nThis Sunday, many Mastercard users around the world found themselves in a bit of a bind.\n\nWhether you were trying to shop online or pay for your morning coffee, the usual ease of tapping your card seemed to vanish. Reports from countries including France began rolling in early on 9 March, with frustrated customers unable to complete their transactions.\n\nWorldwide payment glitch: Mastercard outage disrupts transactions everywhere\n\nAcross various online platforms, reports of payment failures spiked dramatically. Sites like Down Detector quickly lit up as people shared their experiences of not being able to use their Mastercard for everyday purchases. While the rush of reports has slowed a bit now, the early hours of Sunday certainly showcased how deeply integrated these digital payments have become in our daily lives.\n\nAwaiting answers: No official word yet from Mastercard\n\nAt the moment, Mastercard hasn\u2019t issued an official statement explaining what went wrong or when services might be restored. This lack of communication has left many users in a state of uncertainty, wondering if this glitch might become a recurring problem. In the meantime, everyone is keeping a close watch on Mastercard\u2019s channels, hoping for some clarity soon.\n\nThis incident is a stark reminder of our reliance on digital payment systems and how disruptions can throw a wrench in our daily routines. As we await further updates, it\u2019s clear that, for now, the world of online shopping and payments is on pause.",

Nominated by President Joe Biden in February 2023, Banga was confirmed by the World Bank\u2019s Board of Governors on May 3, 2023.\n\nBanga is the first person of South Asian ancestry to hold the position. He was previously the president and CEO of Mastercard Inc.\n\nThe World Bank provides loans, grants, and technical assistance to developing countries to reduce poverty and promote economic growth. Banga is serving a five-year term, succeeding David Malpass, an economist and former U.S. Treasury official appointed during the first Trump administration.\n\nKey Takeaways Ajay Banga is an Indian-American business executive with a business background in various sectors, including finance, banking, and technology.\n\nBanga began a five-year term as head of the World Bank in June 2023.\n\nThe World Bank is an international organization dedicated to providing financing, advice, and research to developing nations to aid their economic advancement.\n\nBanga\u2019s primary objective will be to guide the World Bank toward growth and development, with a direct impact on poverty alleviation and climate change.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nBanga has had a distinguished career spanning over four decades in various sectors including consumer goods, finance and banking, and technology. Most recently, he has been the president and CEO of Mastercard and vice chairman of General Atlantic, a private equity firm. He has been recognized for his leadership in advancing financial inclusion, digital transformation, and sustainable development.\n\n\n\nAjaypal Singh Banga was born on Nov. 10, 1959, in Khadki, a small town in Maharashtra, India, to a Sikh family. His father was an officer in the Indian Army, so the family moved around the country. Excelling academically, he received numerous awards and scholarships.\n\nIn 1981, Banga earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors in economics from St. Stephen\u2019s College in Delhi. He then completed a post graduate program in Management (equivalent to an MBA) at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad.\n\nProfessional Experience\n\nBanga began his professional career as an intern at Nestle in India. Over the following 13 years, he held positions there in sales, marketing, and general management, and played a key role in launching products and brands for the company in India.\n\nIn 1994, he joined PepsiCo as head of marketing for its snacks division in India.\n\nIn 1996, Banga moved to Citigroup's global consumer banking division, eventually becoming the CEO of Citigroup Asia Pacific in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, he left Citigroup to join Mastercard, where he became CEO in July 2010. Under his leadership, Mastercard evolved from a traditional payments company into one that leveraged data analytics and embraced fintech.\n\nIn 2020, Banga was elected chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). In 2022, he the private equity firm General Atlantic.\n\nWorld Bank Nomination\n\nIn February 2023, Banga was nominated by President Joe Biden to take over as president of the World Bank and he was confirmed to begin the five-year term in May 2023.\n\nBanga replaced Trump nominee David Malpass, who stepped down a year before his term ended during a controversy over his views on climate change. In an appearance at a New York conference, he refused to agree that fossil fuels play a role in global warming, saying he was \"not a scientist.\" He later said he was not a climate change \"denier.\"\n\nBiden on Banga\n\n\u201cAjay Banga will be a transformative leader,\u201d President Biden said, speaking of his nominee, \u201cbringing expertise, experience, and innovation to the position of the World Bank president.\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also supported his nomination publicly.\n\nThe World Bank is an international organization dedicated to providing financing and advisory services to projects that advance the economies of developing nations.\n\nAbout the World Bank\n\nThe World Bank was created on Dec. 27, 1945, as part of the Bretton Woods Agreement and consists of five organizations:\n\n\u2022 International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)\n\n\u2022 International Development Association (IDA)\n\n\u2022 International Finance Corp. (IFC)\n\n\u2022 Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)\n\n\u2022 International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)\n\nAs its president, Banga's job is to guide the bank's efforts at poverty alleviation and climate change mitigation.\n\nThe World Bank is dealing with increasing debt loads in lower- and middle-income countries as well as the impact on food and energy markets caused by ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\nWhy Does the U.S. President Choose the Head of the World Bank? The U.S. president nominates the head of the World Bank due to an informal agreement that dates back to the end of World War II. The U.S. and the European powers created two financial institutions as part of the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944: The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It was agreed that the U.S. would choose the head of the former, and Europe the latter. The World Bank is based in Washington, D.C., but has offices in more than 130 countries.\n\nWho Owns the World Bank? No person, organization, government, or nation owns the World Bank. It is an organization made up of member countries represented by a Board of Governors. This board governs the organization, creates policies, and appoints executive directors. The executive directors govern the bank\u2019s business and budget and grant loan approvals. The president and managers manage the day-to-day operations.\n\nWhat Is the Purpose of the World Bank? The World Bank\u2019s mission is to provide financing, advice, technical support, and research to developing nations to help advance their economies and combat poverty.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAs president of the World Bank, Ajay Banga is tasked with guiding the organization toward growth and development while addressing poverty alleviation and climate change.\n\nHe is expected to face challenges as the World Bank deals with increasing debt loads in lower- and middle-income countries as well as the impact on food and energy markets caused by the war between Russia and Ukraine.",

Both companies are understood to profit from the arrangements, earning a small fee each time a transaction is made.\n\nThe card companies\u2019 links to the unlicensed sites are revealed in the wake of an investigation coordinated by Investigate Europe into a network of gambling sites operating in parts of Europe despite being banned.\n\nOne customer said they were left suicidal after losing about \u00a360,000 unwittingly gambling on an unlicensed site. In another case, a man successfully pursued an operator in the German courts after \u00adlosing more than \u00a3200,000. \u201cThose who run these casinos have stolen my life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe nine websites operating in the UK do not hold gambling licences, which are required by law, but appear in search listings and are promoted on social media. The five most popular sites drew about four million UK visits between last October and December.\n\nView image in fullscreen One of the unlicensed sites targeting UK customers. Illustration: Screenshot\n\nThey have been accused of failing to pay winnings and spamming problem gamblers. FatPirate, which advertises a welcome bonus of up to \u00a3425, has been the subject of several complaints that it prevented users from withdrawing money they had won. One UK customer claimed they had won \u00a36,000 after spending \u00a33,270 with their bank card but were unable to withdraw it.\n\nA customer of another of the unlicensed sites, Gransino, claimed their account had been deleted after they complained about being unable to withdraw winnings. When they contacted support they were told that it was the end of the matter. \u201cThey take your money and never pay out,\u201d they said, adding that they were \u201cdevastated\u201d. Both of the sites were offering Mastercard payment last week.\n\nThe operators of the websites, based overseas, did not respond to requests for comment. Mastercard and Visa said they prohibited illegal activity on their networks and would investigate. The Gambling Commission, which regulates gambling in Great Britain, said it was aware of the sites and would \u201ccontinue to take action against them\u201d.\n\nThe findings raise questions about the role of the payment giants in facilitating unlicensed gambling transactions \u2013 and about the apparent failure of regulators to tackle the sites in the first place.\n\nThe Gambling Commission is understood to have received complaints about at least five of the nine websites identified in the analysis. But they remained accessible last week \u2013 accepting card payments from UK customers and offering deals in sterling, including welcome bonuses of up to \u00a31,800 and hundreds of free spins.\n\nView image in fullscreen Iain Duncan Smith, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on gambling reform, said: \u2018These companies must immediately up their game.\u2019 Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nMastercard and Visa had agreed to block payments linked to unlicensed operators, entering into a voluntary arrangement alongside PayPal with the Gambling Commission in 2014. The companies are legally obliged to take steps to prevent the use of their networks for criminal activity. But the Observer found them facilitating payments for illicit websites with high traffic, which in some cases have been publicly linked to alleged scams, raising questions about the robustness of their due diligence.\n\nSeparately, records of complaints to the gambling watchdog reveal the scale of the illicit market in Britain \u2013 there were at least 922 complaints about unlicensed operators in the two years to December, according to documents obtained by Investigate Europe under freedom of information laws. Several complaints mention Mastercard and Visa by name. One person indicated that they had won about \u00a370,000 on an unlicensed gambling site, which allowed transactions with Mastercard but were only able to withdraw a fraction of that.\n\nIain Duncan Smith, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on gambling reform, said the findings were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. The former Conservative leader said that while most online gambling harm was caused by licensed firms, regulators \u201cmust do more to clamp down on abuses by unlicensed operators\u201d.\n\nHe said Mastercard and Visa risked lending unregulated sites credibility. \u201cThese companies must immediately up their game and start blocking all unlicensed gambling site transactions,\u201d he said.\n\nMastercard said it had \u201czero tolerance for illegal activity\u201d on its network and that when issues were identified, it investigated them so it could \u201cwork with partners to take the appropriate action\u201d. \u201cWe will now do that with the sites you noted,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nView image in fullscreen WildRobin, an unlicensed gambling site, offering UK customers the chance to pay by Visa or Mastercard. Illustration: Screenshot\n\nThe company said it did not have a direct relationship with the gambling sites and that it was down to banks to ensure that merchants were acting lawfully and in line with Mastercard\u2019s rules. Neither it nor Visa commented on the previous agreement with the Gambling Commission to block unlicensed gambling transactions.\n\nVisa said illegal activity on its network was \u201cexplicitly and unequivocally\u201d prohibited. \u201cWe take this very seriously and investigate all reports of illegal activity,\u201d a spokesperson said, adding that the company has \u201cno direct relationship with merchants\u201d but works with partners to terminate those selling illegal services, and \u201cconstantly invests\u201d in \u201cbest-in-class technology\u201d to enforce compliance.\n\nDuring the Observer\u2019s testing, the payments were made via a payment tool called PaymentIQ embedded in the gambling websites. The \u201cpayment orchestration\u201d tool is widely used by businesses in high-risk sectors to route transactions via different financial institutions, maximising the chance of them being approved.\n\nFrench payment services company Worldline, which owns PaymentIQ, said it was a \u201cneutral\u201d software solution that did not control customer funds or process payments. \u201cPaymentIQ has no responsibility for ensuring that scheme rules and the acquiring partners of the merchant fulfil their obligations,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nProfessor Heather Wardle, an expert in gambling harms at the University of Glasgow, said the findings were evidence of the \u201cwide and complex commercial ecosystem\u201d underpinning unlicensed gambling. She said \u201cevery actor\u201d in the chain should be accountable. \u201cThey should not be complacent about how their actions enable these harms,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Gambling Commission said it was working hard to disrupt the unlicensed market, including issuing \u201cover 770 cease and desist notices\u201d and referring more than 100,000 URLs to Google for removal in the past 11 months. Chief executive Andrew Rhodes has previously cited \u201cphoenixing\u201d as a key challenge for the watchdog \u2013 where duplicate websites are created after illegal ones are taken down.\n\nA spokesperson said customers could easily check if sites were licensed by searching its website, adding that those gambling on unlicensed ones were \u201cputting themselves at risk\u201d. \u201cYour financial data could be stolen, harvested or misused and you may not even be paid out if you win,\u201d they said.\n\nThe Betting & Gaming Council, an industry lobby group representing licensed operators, says gamblers in Great Britain spend more than \u00a32.7bn on unlicensed sites each year. It said the \u201cillegal and growing gambling black market\u201d posed a \u201csignificant threat\u201d.",

            "content": "In the latest clash over card interchange fees, the UK\u2019s Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) has criticized Visa and Mastercard for ratcheting up fees and dominating the card market.\n\nFollowing a review of UK market conditions, the PSR determined that debit and credit card fees on these payment rails add an extra \u00a3170 million ($219.7 million) in annual costs for businesses. Over the past eight years, the regulator also found that Visa and Mastercard have raised their service fees to acquirers by roughly 25% without justification based on costs, competition, or innovation.\n\n\u201cThe switches can be a bit of an easy target,\u201d said Hugh Thomas, Lead Commercial Payments Analyst at Javelin Strategy & Research. \u201cWhen global multinationals are put in contrast to small businesses in a given country it can certainly seem like big beating up on small, but I would say these fee structures are not pulled from the air\u2014they\u2019re designed to create an appropriate balance between the needs of the merchant and the needs of the issuer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issuer is effectively being asked to cover risk that the cardholder buys something and doesn\u2019t eventually pay for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe card is meant to be an encouragement to spend more on a given visit, i.e. more than the cash you might have in your pocket. The merchant realizes the benefits of not having to manage credit and not having to account for countless cash drop-offs.\u201d\n\nReconciliation Outside of Regulation\n\nDespite the benefits card networks offer merchants, the interchange fees they charge have been controversial. In the U.S., a $30 billion settlement between Visa and Mastercard and merchants\u2014largely based on interchange fees\u2014was tabled after a federal judge determined the settlement amount was too low.\n\nHowever, the best hope for reconciliation between merchants and card networks might lie outside of the courtroom.\n\n\u201cThe regulators don\u2019t want to wade in and legislate outcomes, they want to legislate the circumstances that drive optimal outcomes,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThat is having conversations between the merchant associations and the banks to say, \u2018Tell us why you think your pricing is fair or not fair, and we will try\u2014in as not heavy-handed a manner as we can\u2014to ensure that everybody remains happy.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Appropriate Balancing Act\n\nThis approach has been successful in areas like Canada, where agreements between card networks and merchants\u2014that are not imposed by regulators\u2014have established processes to periodically review interchange fees and ensure they are priced appropriately.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a balancing act,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWhen you read provocative statements designed to grab headlines, I don\u2019t think you get the full picture of what\u2019s going on. The process should be to hash through the issues such that everybody gets heard and you get the optimal outcome where maybe nobody\u2019s happy, but it\u2019s the appropriate balancing act.\u201d",

            "content": "Mastercard, Inc. has agreed to pay $26 million to settle a pay discrimination lawsuit filed by female, Black and Hispanic employees.\n\nThe complaint alleged Mastercard\u2019s compensation, promotion and assignment practices had an adverse impact on female, Black and Hispanic employees who were paid less than their similarly situated male and white co-workers, resulting in pay discrimination in violation of the Equal Pay Act.\n\nApproximately 7,500 female, Black and/or Hispanic employees were included in the proposed class action. About 1,200 are in both the gender and race protected classes.\n\nAs an example of the allegations listed, one plaintiff alleged she was hired at a specific level on the company\u2019s rubric and offered a salary that aligned with that job. However, she said she was required to perform work outside of the scope of her role, \u201cincluding taking on managerial work that should\u2019ve been performed by individuals in the next level up.\u201d\n\nIn her view, this requirement amounted to pay discrimination. She said she left the company because she was not receiving equal pay for equal work.\n\nEight-Figure Payout, Regular Pay Equity Audits & More\n\nMastercard agreed to settle the case before the proposed class action complaint was filed in federal court, according to Outten & Golden LLP, the firm that handled the case.\n\nUnder the preliminary settlement agreement, Microsoft will:\n\nPay $26 million into a settlement fund that will cover the alleged backpay payments to class members and other damages and interest, as well as court-approved attorneys\u2019 fees and administrative fees for the settlement fund.\n\nContinue to conduct annual pay equity audits with an external consulting firm for three years and report those results publicly to ensure there is no ongoing pay discrimination.\n\nHire an industrial organizational psychologist to evaluate its career ecosystem for bias.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased to have reached this nationwide settlement with Mastercard, which we believe represents a fair compromise,\u201d Cara E. Greene, Partner at Outten & Golden LLP and lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. \u201cImportantly, the non-monetary terms of the settlement will help ensure that Mastercard maintains an equitable workplace for the thousands of women and people of color it employs. Settlements like this help to level the playing field and move the entire industry closer to pay equity.\u201d\n\nNext Steps to Prevent Pay Discrimination\n\nAs you may have heard, Women\u2019s Equal Pay Day is right around the corner \u2014 on March 25.\n\nPay transparency can help reduce the pay gap between men and women. It can also help reduce pay inequities by preventing pay discrimination based on other protected categories, like race, age and religion.\n\nThe good news is, many employers take steps to make sure employees are paid competitively, according to a recent survey. In Workplace Policies and Pay Transparency, 301 employers shared their pay transparency strategies. The top three reported action steps were:\n\nMarket-pricing all or a significant number of our jobs (63%) Updating our salary structure(s) or market pay ranges (58%), and Conducting a pay equity analysis (49%).\n\nClick here to see the full list.\n\nFiled under",

Fees have jumped by at least 25% since 2017, costing U.K. businesses at least an extra 170 million pounds (about $219 million) per year.\n\nThe companies have not offered \u201csufficiently clear and detailed information\u201d on fees, leading to worsening outcomes for merchants and acquirers, especially in terms of raising their costs, per the release.\n\n\u201cThey then have little choice but to either pass these increased costs onto consumers or incur the costs themselves, impacting their ability to invest,\u201d the release said.\n\nMastercard emailed the following statement to PYMNTS:\n\n\u201cWe disagree with the findings in today\u2019s report, which continues to underplay the true competitiveness of the payment industry and our ongoing innovation and investment into security and the consumer experience. Our resilient, global network provides peace of mind and strong consumer protections, preventing billions of pounds of fraud each year. We will continue to work transparently with our customers and demonstrate to the PSR the significant value Mastercard and electronic payments bring to people and businesses across the UK.\u201d\n\nReached for comment by PYMNTS, a Visa spokesperson said the company\u2019s fees reflect the \u201cimmense value\u201d the company provides merchants, consumers and financial institutions.\n\n\u201cThis includes extremely high levels of security and fraud prevention, near-perfect operational resilience and reliability, and a wide range of consumer protections and high-quality products and services that serve consumer and merchant needs,\u201d the company said. \u201cThrough our investments, the U.K. has been a global pioneer in payments technology.\u201d\n\nThe PSR\u2019s action came as Mastercard\u2019s and Visa\u2019s place in the marketplace is being called into question elsewhere.\n\nFor example, November brought a report that the European Commission was investigating whether the companies\u2019 \u201cscheme fees\u201d were harming retailers.\n\nAlso in November, the Senate Judiciary Committee convened a hearing on Visa\u2019s and Mastercard\u2019s fees, with Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, then-chair of the committee, accusing the companies of having a \u201cstranglehold\u201d on the credit card market.",

The rewards are just OK\n\nThe Luxury Card website says cardmembers \u201creceive leading airfare and cash back redemption rates.\u201d But dig a little deeper and the rewards aren't actually better than the competition.\n\nHere\u2019s how much they're worth:\n\nLuxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Titanium Card\u2122: Points are worth 2 cents apiece for airfare redemptions and 1 cent apiece for other redemptions.\n\nLuxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Black Card\u2122. Points are worth 2 cents apiece for airfare redemptions, 1.5 cents apiece for cash back and 1 cent apiece for other redemptions.\n\nLuxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Gold Card\u2122: Points are worth 2 cents apiece for both airfare redemptions and cash back and 1 cent apiece for other redemptions.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nSure, the points on these cards can be worth up to 2 cents apiece, which is double the standard 1 cent per point offered on many cards. But you'll only earn 1 point per dollar spent. Assuming you redeem all your rewards for 2 cents per point, this is essentially the same earnings rate as Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card. Each mile is worth 1 cent, but you'll earn 2 miles per dollar on most purchases.\n\nEven though the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card has an annual fee of $395, you have the potential to eke even more value out of your points by transferring them to a travel loyalty program. This card and its chief competitors the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae (annual fee: $550) and The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express (annual fee: $695) have multiple airline and hotel partners that allow you to transfer your points to loyalty programs at a 1-to-1 rate (Terms apply). If you transferred points on one of these cards to a partner to take advantage of a high-value redemption, you might be able to get, say, 5 cents of value out of each point.\n\nThe cards in the Luxury Card collection don\u2019t have transfer partners; the maximum value you can get out of each point is 2 cents.\n\n3. They're made of heavy metal\n\nThe cards from the Luxury Card collection are mostly unspectacular, but they do stand out in one way: They all have attractive metal designs. Luxury Card notes that it has 83 patents issued globally for its metal card constructions that \"outweigh the competition.\" The Luxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Gold Card\u2122 \u2014 the one with a $995 annual fee \u2014 is even plated in 24-karat gold.\n\n4. Some of the perks are fancy\n\nAs is usually the case with premium cards, the offerings in the Luxury Card collection come with some swanky perks. Here are some of the most valuable:\n\nAnnual airline credit. The Luxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Gold Card\u2122 offers $200 in annual air travel credit toward qualifying purchases. The Luxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Black Card\u2122 offers $100 a year in such credit.\n\nCredit for Global Entry or TSA Precheck application fee. These programs can get you through airport security and customs faster. The credit is available on the Black and Gold cards, but not on the Titanium.\n\nPriority Pass Select membership. This perk, which gets you into airport lounges around the world, is available on the Black and Gold cards, but not on the Titanium.\n\nConcierge. All three cards offer 24/7 access to the Luxury Card Concierge. This service assists with such tasks as recovering items left behind at a hotel, planning a special event or arranging a last-minute delivery.\n\n5. Overall, the cards are so-so\n\nThe cards in the Luxury Card portfolio are decent, but for the cost, you can do better.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nConsider this: In the Luxury Card family, only one card \u2014 the Luxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Gold Card\u2122, which has an annual fee of $995 \u2014 offers $200 in airline credits, a Global Entry or TSA Precheck application credit and Priority Pass Select membership benefits. Meanwhile, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae and The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express offer similar benefits and more at a fraction of the price.\n\nTo be clear, the cards in the Luxury Card portfolio aren\u2019t terrible. As showy premium cards, they\u2019re OK. But if you\u2019re spending a fortune on an annual fee, you might want more than that.

Indeed the regulator said today that it has \u201cfound that there is a lack of competition in the market\u201d and evidence that Visa and Mastercard are therefore able to charge more than they would normally with more rivals breathing down their necks.\n\nRemedies May be Needed\n\nAs such the regulator plans to impose what it describes as \u201cremedies\u201d on the card providers. This could include caps on the fees the two companies charge. However, it plans to consult on these remedies before taking any \u201ccorrective action.\u201d\n\nAccording to the FT both Visa and Mastercard moved swiftly to defend their policies. Mastercard said it disagreed with the regulator\u2019s findings and that it underplayed the work it did in innovation and investment into security. Visa said its fees reflected the \u201cimmense value\u201d that it provides to financial institutions, merchants and consumers.\n\nHowever, it is not just the U.K. where they are under pressure. An EU investigation into competition concerns around the two providers is also understood to be in motion.\n\nIs V a Good Stock to Buy Now?\n\nOn TipRanks, V has a Strong Buy consensus based on 25 Buy and 3 Hold ratings.

            "content": "If you have a Westgate Resorts timeshare or you visit one of the hotel chain\u2019s resorts frequently, then the World of Westgate Mastercard \u2014 issued by First Electronic Bank and serviced by Imprint \u2014 can help you earn extra rewards on your next vacation with little effort.\n\nThis $0-annual-fee card earns a solid 3% back on Westgate purchases, even including your timeshare mortgage. But since this card doesn\u2019t offer elevated rewards on any other purchases and you can only redeem your rewards at Westgate, most people \u2014 even some timeshare owners \u2014 will likely fare better with a general travel credit card.\n\nBut if you\u2019re a Westgate loyalist who wants a simple way to earn rewards on your vacation, the card\u2019s straightforward rewards and convenient redemption might be a good option for you.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the World of Westgate Mastercard.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The company previously offered a different credit card, Westgate Rewards Mastercard, which was issued by Comenity Bank but discontinued in 2021.\n\n1. Applying won't automatically impact your credit scores\n\nWhen you apply for the World of Westgate Mastercard, Imprint won't automatically do a hard credit pull. You'll be able to see if you're approved first and what your credit limit would be. The company will perform a hard credit pull only if you decide to accept the offer. If you're on the fence about applying (or are unsure if you will be approved), this perk can help you make your decision without impacting your credit scores.\n\nTravel Rewards Expert Reveals... Why this is her top credit card for dining rewards, and she shows you exactly how she realizes more than $1,000 in value from it each year. Click for details\n\n2. You\u2019ll earn a small sign-up bonus\n\nOnce you\u2019re approved and make three purchases in the first 180 days, you\u2019ll receive 50,000 points, which can be redeemed for $50 back on future purchases at Westgate. This is significantly lower than sign-up bonuses on other no-annual-fee cards, but it\u2019s rare for a credit card to offer a bonus without requiring you to spend a specific amount of money first.\n\nSimilar hotel cards might require you to spend anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 before you can get a bonus. With the World of Westgate Mastercard, any three purchases \u2014 no matter how small \u2014 will qualify you for the bonus.\n\n3. Earnings are underwhelming\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nPurchases with Westgate earn 3% back \u2014 including on-property purchases and timeshare mortgage payments. The ability to pay your timeshare mortgage on a credit card is unique.\n\nEven though this is a solid rate, the World of Westgate Mastercard doesn\u2019t make a good standalone card because you won\u2019t earn elevated rewards on any purchase outside the hotel chain. All other purchases earn 1% back.\n\nIf you prefer to keep only one card in your wallet, the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card could be a good alternative. Cardholders earn 2% back on purchases. Sure, you\u2019d earn slightly less on Westgate purchases, but the higher rate on purchases outside of the hotel will easily make up the difference.\n\nWestgate loyalists could also carry both credit cards and use the World of Westgate Mastercard with the hotel brand and the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card on everything else.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip You'll earn rewards in the form of points, and 10 points are worth 1 cent. So for every dollar you spend at Westgate, you'll earn 30 points, which equals 3 cents.\n\n4. You can only redeem rewards at Westgate\n\nThe rewards you earn on the World of Westgate Mastercard can only be redeemed for Westgate purchases. But you don\u2019t have to redeem your rewards for reservations. You can also redeem for timeshare mortgages, restaurants on site and on-property activities.\n\nSince you can redeem your rewards on many Westgate purchases, it probably won\u2019t be too hard for timeshare holders and frequent Westgate visitors to redeem rewards. But other cards will offer you more flexibility. With the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card, rewards are much more flexible. You can redeem your rewards for a statement credit, a mailed check, direct deposit into a Wells Fargo checking or savings account or a withdrawal at a Wells Fargo ATM (in increments of $20).\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Westgate does have loyalty status levels, but higher tiers are reserved for timeshare owners. Anyone can join the Member Tier, which gives you up to 10% off direct bookings, complimentary Wi-Fi and discounts on certain fees.\n\n5. The card doesn\u2019t come with many perks\n\nMany hotel cards \u2014 even some with no annual fee \u2014 come with valuable extras like elite status, free nights and annual spending bonuses. The World of Westgate Mastercard is missing all of these perks. If you\u2019re already a timeshare owner or otherwise loyal to the hotel brand, this isn\u2019t necessarily a dealbreaker. But if you\u2019re not partial to Westgate, you will probably get more value out of a different hotel card.",

Something new and trending caught his eye: white earbuds trailed by a white cord that disappeared into a morass of clothing. Those early sightings of original iPod users inspired gmoney not only to buy stock in Apple, but to start investing in companies that would revolutionize tech and fashion.\n\nYears later, as a Web3 entrepreneur, gmoney spied the start of the non-fungible token craze and quickly divined the tech\u2019s disruptive potential. He began to envision how the technology could do more than just generate highly collectible, uniquely generated CryptoPunk and Squiggle art for passive collectors and investors. Understanding how the technology could bridge physical and digital worlds, in 2022 he launched 9dcc, a \u201cnetworked product\u201d brand that sells fashion and lifestyle products embedded with chips that wearers scan to reveal ownable digital assets offering real-world experiences and rewards.\n\nNow 9dcc is collaborating with Mastercard to launch a golf-themed capsule collection at the annual Arnold Palmer Invitational golf tournament near Orlando this weekend. Each item is embedded with next-gen technologies allowing Mastercard cardholders to access exclusive experiences that blur the lines of digital and physical. People will be able to purchase the caps, towels and shirts at a pop-up store at the event or on Priceless.com, and then tap the embedded chips with their phones to claim the item\u2019s digital twin. These will open up a range of \u201cphygital\u201d experiences including the opportunity to receive Priceless Experiences.\n\nThe Mastercard Newsroom recently chatted with gmoney about the potential of phygital experiences to reshape retail.\n\nWhat got you hooked on non-fungible tokens?\n\ngmoney: When I found NFTs, they quickly made sense to me. I thought this form of verifying scarcity in the digital component would be really big. I just didn't imagine NFTs would blow up as quickly as they did. I went down that rabbit hole, started to make a name for myself and ended up collaborating with Adidas and Prada on their NFT drops.\n\nHow did your 9dcc fashion label evolve?\n\ngmoney: I wanted to build something that linked the real world to the digital perspective. I've always taken an interest in fashion cycles and understood the industry a little bit from the investment side.\n\nNone of the brands out there had the aesthetic that signaled I was successful, but I was also in crypto, so I thought why not just create the vision that I wanted to see?\n\nWe're very much focused on crypto natives, and I would say our style is luxury streetwear. Right now we mainly sell menswear, and at our drop before Christmas, we sold 3,000 products in 42 seconds.",

They can instantly access RiskRecon ratings from vendor profiles within the Whistic Trust Catalog, allowing for swift and informed risk decisions. By integrating these ratings with Whistic\u2019s AI-driven risk assessments, organizations can ensure continuous monitoring across their entire inventory.\n\nMoves like this are likely to drive higher revenues through increased adoption of Mastercard\u2019s value-added services and solutions. Management estimates adjusted net revenues to witness low-double-digit growth in 2025 from the 2024 figure.\n\nMA\u2019s Share Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of Mastercard have gained 5.4% year to date compared with the industry\u2019s 8.8% growth.

            "content": "Entrepreneurial spirit is high among women in Egypt, who aspire to pursue their dreams, gain financial independence and make a difference in the world, according to Mastercard\u2019s latest research, released ahead of International Women\u2019s Day 2025.\n\nAs part of its commitment to advancing financial inclusion, Mastercard has launched this report across its Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (EEMEA) region, including Egypt. The initiative is designed to champion women entrepreneurs, provide key business insights and drive tangible solutions to break down systemic barriers.\n\n\u201cOur research highlights the remarkable entrepreneurial spirit among women across the EEMEA region. While progress has been made, challenges remain, reinforcing the need for stronger support. At Mastercard, we are dedicated to nurturing the next generation of small business leaders and equipping them with the tools they need to grow and thrive,\u201d said Selin Bahadirli, executive vice president, Services, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, Mastercard.\n\nEgypt\u2019s entrepreneurial landscape\n\nIn Egypt, a significant proportion of men (41%) and women (38%) identify as entrepreneurs, reflecting the country\u2019s evolving business landscape. In contrast to the rest of EEMEA, older generations, especially Gen X (54% of men and 51% of women) are more likely to consider themselves entrepreneurs than millennials and Gen Z.\n\n77% of women in Egypt have considered starting or running their own business. This increases to 83% among Gen Z women. However, more than half (56%) of Egyptian women are yet to do so.\n\nAs well as formal business ventures, half of Egyptian women have a side hustle to make money outside of their main job, rising to 59% among Gen X women. For many women, the entrepreneurial spirit is inspired by an appetite to earn more money (60%), save for a specific goal (52%) and gain financial independence (45%).\n\nThe most commonly cited reasons for starting their business among women founders in Egypt are that they wanted to pursue their dream (48%) or had a brilliant idea that they needed to see through (39%). 37% of women said they desired freedom from traditional working structures, the same number wanted a better work-life balance, an equal number felt the time was right in their life, and the same percentage believed their idea could improve people\u2019s lives. The last number is far higher than the global average, where 20% of women cited this as a motivation for starting their business.\n\nTop sectors in which Egyptian women would like to start a business include education (24%), cosmetics (20%) and marketing/advertising/PR/market research (17%).\n\nIn an encouraging finding, 98% of women business owners in Egypt are optimistic about revenue growth over the next five years. This number is higher than in the rest of EEMEA (89%).\n\nUnlocking new opportunities\n\nDespite the evident appetite for entrepreneurship, the research shows that for many women, including current business owners, there are challenges. The risk of failure (30%) and getting the capital to launch (25%) are reported as the biggest challenges preventing women from starting a business. Meanwhile, women are more likely than men to view lack of confidence as a hurdle (8% vs. 6%).\n\nAmong women who have already founded a business, 37% say the biggest challenge when starting out was assessing critical digital infrastructure, such as payment systems, and 35% were struggling to find funding. A third say the biggest challenge was knowing which technology was right for their business. More than a quarter (26%) of women want to build a sustainable business but do not know how \u2013 this is similar to all women across EEMEA (31%).\n\nTraining on how to develop a business plan (38%), access to AI tools to solve business challenges (34%) and having a business partner (33%) would make Egyptian women feel more confident in starting their own business. The research notes that women in the country are more open to embracing advanced technologies to help them do business than their male counterparts. 73% of Egyptian founders (men and women) regularly use AI in their business, and 87% say it has delivered significant cost and/or time savings for their business.\n\nIn terms of cybersecurity, 81% of men and 80% for women feel the need to better educate themselves about how to protect their business from a potential cyberattack. However, men (41%) are more likely than women (24%) to admit they are unsure how to protect their business from a cyberattack. These findings highlight the key role of secure digital transactions in business success.\n\nMastercard\u2019s survey sends a clear message that Egyptian women have the ambition to shape the future of business yet are facing significant challenges. As International Women\u2019s Day 2025 approaches, the company remains committed to fostering an inclusive digital economy where women entrepreneurs are not just supported but celebrated as key drivers of economic progress.",

Within a month, two teams of specially trained Mastercard employees hit the ground to support the American Red Cross\u2019s relief efforts, serving thousands of people from all walks of life whose homes and businesses had been reduced to smoking rubble.\n\nvolunteers Nick Harris, Christy Corrington, Lisa Thompson, Janet Kelleher and Erika Cruz unload supplies from a truck\n\n\u201cWe all have stories to share, and they are what drive us every day,\u201d says Deann Donohue, an O\u2019Fallon, Missouri-based vice president in the company\u2019s Public Sector Center of Excellence who deployed with the first team of volunteers. \u201cIt's providing supplies to the husband whose wife passed the year before who is hoping to find her urn. It\u2019s listening to the fire brigade medic whose parents called him to say news reporters were standing in front of his place as it was burning down.\u201d\n\nMastercard launched its disaster relief corps with the American Red Cross in 2019, with 53 employees trained in all aspects of aid distribution, disaster assessment and shelter operations. Today, Mastercard has 687 employees ready to help, some of whom have deployed multiple times, including to Hurricane Helene in North Carolina last year, Hurricane Ian in Florida in 2022 and the western Kentucky tornadoes in 2021.\n\nIn the deployment\u2019s spare moments, Donohue and Joe Kaczorowski, a senior vice president for Risk Analytics based in Purchase, New York, shared dispatches from their time in Los Angeles.\n\nTerry Winfree show Corrington how to process a client intake at the shelter.\n\nDay 1: Getting the assignment\n\nIt\u2019s a stark 2 a.m. wake-up for the Purchase-based volunteers, including Kaczorowski, to make the flight out to Los Angeles. A group of 20 volunteers from different offices across the U.S. are doing the same for this first deployment; another dozen employees will fly out next week to relieve them.\n\nUpon arrival, the volunteers join the Red Cross disaster response operation\u2019s stand-up meeting to hear the game plan for the week ahead. \u201cI've already received comments about how they like the energy and collaboration we bring to the mission,\u201d Kaczorowski writes. \u201cSo it's exciting to feel welcomed here.\u201d\n\nAt the hotel, it\u2019s bittersweet to meet new volunteers and see familiar faces from both Red Cross and Mastercard offices. Some of these same volunteers were from the Hurricane Helene response in western North Carolina last fall.\n\n\u201cI remember from my very first deployment resettling Afghan refugees in Texas that a woman told me that people talk about time differently in the Red Cross,\u201d Kaczorowski writes. \u201cIt's not, \u2018How many years have you been involved?\u2019 It's \u2018How many deployments have you done?\u2019 It's really inspiring to see the shift in the concept of time within our own Mastercard team with so many having done multiple deployments now.\u201d\n\nVolunteers Erika Cruz, Lisa Thompson and Janet Kelleher work to reunite shelter residents with their lost belongings.\n\nDay 2: On the ground\n\nWith more than four active fires, the recovery work scatters volunteers across the county.\n\nDonohue is stationed at UCLA Research Center close to the Palisades Fire, where FEMA and other organizations are offering services ranging from temporary housing to mental health care to help reprinting Social Security cards and birth certificates.\n\nAcross the city, Kaczorowski is stationed at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium shelter, which is serving as a Red Cross sanctuary for those in need. The Mastercard team is focused on consolidating residents from multiple ballrooms into a single ballroom to make operations more efficient and ensure an accurate count of shelter residents. That means trying to find those assigned to the cots and, if they\u2019ve already found a new place to move, formally checking them out of the shelter, bagging what is left behind and storing the items in case they return for them.\n\nThe enormous ballroom serving as the infirmary also is emptying out, requiring another consolidation. \u201cThis involved everything from moving crates of belongings, to wheeling people in hospital beds to the new location and helping them set things up in the new room,\u201d Kaczorowski writes. \u201cOverall, once we got going, there was very little down time.\u201d\n\nDay 3: A heavy heart\n\nToday, Donohue is at an Altadena grocery store, one of the only buildings left standing in the community. She is handing out PPE kits for those re-entering their neighborhood. \u201cIt was emotionally harder today; most residents were going back to just ashes but were looking for anything left,\u201d she writes.\n\nKaczorowski is taking on a new role at a new station in the Pasadena Civic Auditorium and spends the day using his Mastercard expertise to help with data and reporting, tracking volunteer assignments and rental cars for the Red Cross. \u201cWe talked about challenges, and I even got to see how they thoughtfully handled interactions with distraught clients who came to talk to them.\u201d\n\nVolunteers Kendra Brown, Christy Corrington, Joe Kaczorowski, and Raina Kadavil with actress Daryl Hannah, kneeling, who visited one of the shelters with two of her miniature horses, and her husband, rock icon Neil Young.\n\nDays 4 and 5: Lifted spirits\n\nDonohue is back in Pacific Palisades, and it\u2019s the city\u2019s first rainy day since the fires started. She spends the day at the Palisades Recreation Center, a brick building left standing in the middle of ashes, where she meets a couple who grew up in her neighborhood back in St. Louis. \u201cWe laughed and cried together \u2014 she said it was one of the first times being back that she was able to smile, and it truly touched me.\u201d\n\nKaczorowski goes back to consolidating shelter spaces that had started to clear out when the day is happily interrupted by the arrival of rock icon Neil Young, who has arrived to play \"Heart of Gold,\" uplifting the shelter one string at a time, and his wife, actress Daryl Hannah, who brings along two miniature horses. \u201cEverywhere I look,\u201d Kaczorowski writes, \u201cI see our team doing little things all over to create comfort and build bonds \u2014 both within the team, but especially with the residents.\u201d\n\nThe first wave of Mastercard volunteers who deployed to Los Angeles gather for a meal, including correspondents Deann Donohue, bottom row, left, and Joe Kaczorowski, top row, right.\n\nDay 6 \u2013 The first deployment ends, but the impact is lasting\n\nAs a new team of Mastercard employees makes its way to California, the first team's members are wrapping up their last deployment day, reflecting on their time.\n\nDonohue is reminded why she volunteers: \u201cAs I spend the week listening and being present for those impacted, I've realized just how important the Red Cross and their volunteers are. It's helping the brother-in-law of a man with dementia who drove in from out of state to start paperwork for resources, and giving water and hugging the couple looking to see if their daughter\u2019s grave was still standing around the corner. It's about supporting each other in times of need.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Kaczorowski is overwhelmed with appreciation for having the opportunity to give back. \u201cVolunteering with disaster relief is not for the faint of heart \u2014 but the reward for me was more than worth every minute. I met so many amazing people, from all walks of life, all over the U.S. and all with one purpose and passion \u2014 to give back. We will be bonded for life, and I can't wait to serve with them all again.\u201d\n\nOriginally published by Mastercard\n\nFollow along Mastercard's journey to connect and power an inclusive, digital economy that benefits everyone, everywhere.",

            "content": "Mastercard recently announced a partnership with Whistic, introducing RiskRecon Assessments Powered by Whistic, which aims to transform third-party risk management through enhanced cybersecurity capabilities. This innovative product announcement could play a role in bolstering Mastercard\u2019s attractiveness to investors, contributing to its 9% price increase over the last quarter. During the same period, Mastercard reported a strong financial performance with Q4 2024 sales and net income rising substantially year-over-year; the full-year metrics also showed significant growth. Additionally, Mastercard's active engagement in strategic initiatives, including launching AI-driven and crypto-related products, enriches its market standing. These developments occurred against a backdrop of a 2.5% market decline amid concerns over tariffs and banking sector volatility. However, Mastercard's resilience along with its strategic ventures mirrors its ongoing adaptation and growth trajectory, which distinguishes it in the financial sector.\n\nSee the full analysis report here for a deeper understanding of Mastercard.\n\nNYSE:MA Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nThe last five years have seen Mastercard achieve impressive total shareholder returns of 125.68%. Key developments have likely played a role in supporting this performance. A significant partnership in March 2021 with Payoneer expanded Mastercard's reach among SMBs and freelancers, enhancing product access for over 5 million businesses. Moreover, share buybacks have been a pivotal factor; by February 2025, Mastercard had repurchased over 15.1 million shares worth US$8.29 billion, effectively reducing supply and enhancing shareholder value. Additionally, the launch of innovative products like biometric cards in March 2021 and the ongoing developments in payment technologies have likely strengthened its competitive edge.\n\nFinancially, Mastercard has shown consistent solid earnings growth, with its profits increasing by an average annual rate of 12.9% and accelerating to 15% last year. While its Price-To-Earnings Ratio is higher compared to industry averages, indicating premium valuation, this hasn't deterred growth. Despite some periods of economic uncertainty, these initiatives and financial maneuvers have collectively contributed to its distinction in the financial sector. In the past year, Mastercard's performance even outpaced the general US market, demonstrating resilience amid broader economic challenges.",

            "content": "With its high fees and interest rates, the Revel\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae won't inspire much merrymaking.\n\nIt's an unsecured credit card for bad credit (aka poor credit, meaning FICO scores of 629 or lower), so on the plus side, you won't have to put down a security deposit. And it's possible to qualify for a relatively generous credit limit, compared with cards in its category. But applying for this card \u2014 which is currently possible only by invitation \u2014 would be costly over time.\n\nA secured credit card can save you more money in the long run, despite the required upfront deposit. With a good payment history, you at least have a chance of getting that deposit back after closing the card or upgrading to an unsecured card with the same issuer. (The fees you'll owe with the Revel\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae are not refundable.) Or, if you can't afford to tie up money in a security deposit, certain alternative credit card options can offer more flexible deposits and a chance to build credit.\n\nEither way, there are more affordable credit cards for bad credit than the Revel\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae. Here's what to know about it.\n\n1. The card is packed with costly fees\n\nWith the Revel\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae \u2014 issued by The Bank of Missouri and serviced by Continental Finance \u2014 you'll be assigned fees that fall between the following ranges, depending on the card's terms:\n\nAn annual fee: $75 - $125. (After that, $99 - $125 annually.) The card's credit limit determines the cost of the annual fee. This is expensive, even for a card for poor credit.\n\nA monthly maintenance fee: $0 - $10 per month (up to $120 annually). This fee isn\u2019t billed for the first 12 months the account is opened, but if you're paying any kind of \"maintenance fee,\" it's a red flag. Most credit cards don't charge them.\n\nAn additional card fee: $30 for every authorized user you add to your account. While some premium travel credit cards may also charge a fee for this, it's rare among most cards.\n\nA \"premium card fee\": You'll owe a one-time fee of $9.95 if you opt for a \"premium\" version of the card that comes in a different color. In any case, for a card like this, it's not a fee worth paying. The platinum version doesn't require this fee.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Learn More\n\nEven if you pass on the premium version of the card and don't add any authorized users, you could still be looking at a possible annual cost of $245 \u2014 and that's without factoring in any potential interest charges. That's ludicrous, even among credit cards for poor credit. Better options exist.\n\nThe Chime Secured Credit Builder Visa\u00ae Credit Card, for instance, doesn\u2019t charge interest because you can\u2019t carry a balance on the card. The card has a flexible security deposit, too. A Chime checking account is required to fund the deposit in the amount of your choice, which is an added step. But compared with paying $245 a year with the Revel\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae, it could be an extra step worth taking.\n\nSee more from Chime\u00ae Chime says the following: The secured Chime Credit Builder Visa\u00ae Credit Card is issued by The Bancorp Bank, N.A. or Stride Bank, N.A., pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. and may be used everywhere Visa credit cards are accepted. Please see the back of your card for its issuing bank.\n\nTo apply for Credit Builder, you must have an active Chime\u00ae Checking Account. Based on a representative study conducted by Experian\u00ae in January 2024, members who made their first purchase with Credit Builder between June 2022 and October 2022 observed an average FICO\u00ae Score 8 increase of 30 points after approximately 8 months. On-time payment history can have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score. On-time payment history may have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score. Chime will report your activities to Transunion\u00ae, Experian\u00ae, and Equifax\u00ae. Impact on your credit may vary, as Credit scores are independently determined by credit bureaus based on a number of factors including the financial decisions you make with other financial services organizations. Money added to Credit Builder will be held in a secured deposit account as collateral for your Credit Builder Visa card, and you can spend up to this amount. You can use money deposited in your Secured Deposit Account to pay off your charges at the end of every month. Out-of-network ATM withdrawal and over the counter advance fees may apply except at MoneyPass ATMs in a 7-Eleven, or any Allpoint or Visa Plus Alliance ATM.\n\n2. The credit limit could double\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nWith the Revel\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae, you'll start out with a credit limit range between $300 to $1,000, depending on eligibility. After making the first six monthly minimum payments on time, you can potentially qualify for a credit limit double the size.\n\nAn increased credit limit can have a positive impact on your credit because it can lower your credit utilization ratio \u2014 the amount of available credit you're using \u2014 which factors heavily into credit scores. But again, there are less expensive credit cards on the market that offer something similar.\n\nFor instance, the $0-annual-fee Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card also offers the possibility of a higher credit limit in as little as six months without having to add to your deposit. Depending on eligibility, you could qualify for a credit limit of $200 for a deposit as low as $49 or $99. Otherwise, the deposit is $200.\n\n3. Carrying a balance is expensive\n\nCredit cards for those with bad credit tend to have high interest rates. The Revel\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae is no exception, with an annual percentage rate approaching a dizzying 30% (as of January 2024). For comparison, as of Q3 2023, the average APR for credit card accounts that incurred interest was 22.77%, based on Federal Reserve data.\n\nTo avoid interest charges, aim to pay off credit card balances in full every month if possible. If you don't want to have to worry about interest charges at all, consider a card like the previously mentioned Chime Secured Credit Builder Visa\u00ae Credit Card, or the Varo Believe Secured Credit Card. Neither card charges interest because neither allows you to carry a balance.\n\n4. Payments are reported to the three major credit bureaus\n\nThe Revel\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae reports payments to the three major credit bureaus: TransUnion, Equifax and Experian. These companies record the information used to calculate your credit scores.\n\nHaving payments recorded by all three bureaus is ideal when you\u2019re working on building credit, but it's not a feature that's unique to the Revel\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae. Even among many products for poor credit, comprehensive credit bureau reporting is table stakes.\n\n5. The Credit Protection program is optional\n\nThe Revel\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae features an optional Continental Credit Protection program that covers the minimum payment owed if you lose your job, become disabled or end up in the hospital. It can also cover the outstanding account balance if you lose your life. Terms apply.\n\nTo qualify, you must pay a monthly fee of 99 cents for every $100 of the outstanding balance. For instance, with a balance of $500, you\u2019ll pay around $5 until the balance decreases. An option like this can put you at ease, but it\u2019s not worth paying an additional fee for it on top of all the other costs attached to the Revel\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae. After all, your estate is responsible for covering any unpaid debts after death. And if no money or property is available to cover it, the debt is generally left unpaid.\n\nIf you\u2019re hospitalized, the program will only cover the minimum payment for one month. Even if you charged over $1,000 to the card, the coverage for a minimum payment wouldn\u2019t amount to much. For disability or unemployment, the program covers the minimum payment for up to 12 months. But if you qualify for unemployment or disability insurance, this kind of protection may not be necessary.",

The annual awards will take place on Sunday 6 April at the iconic Royal Albert Hall, hosted by Beverley Knight and Billy Porter. A highlights package will air on ITV and Magic Radio that evening.\n\nThe competition for nominations has been intense in what has proven to be a transformative year for London theatre, marked by a rich blend of dynamic new works, innovative interpretations of classics, and a commitment to championing diverse voices and stories. A stunning array of stars have trod the boards, and nominees in the craft awards have showcased extraordinary innovation and artistry.\n\nThe Mastercard Best New Musical nominees are the actor-musician led The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, currently playing at the Ambassadors Theatre, MJ The Musical at the Prince Edward Theatre, Donmar Warehouse\u2019s Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet Of 1812, and Marlow and Moss\u2019 Why Am I So Single?. For the Piper-Heidsieck Award for Best Musical Revival, the Regent\u2019s Park Open Air Theatre production of Fiddler On The Roof, which returns later this year to the Barbican Theatre, is up against the dazzling London Palladium production of Hello, Dolly!. Cameron Mackintosh\u2019s reconceived Oliver!, which transferred from Chichester Festival Theatre to the Gielgud Theatre late last year, and the new production of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s Starlight Express, currently playing at the Troubadour Wembley Park Theatre.\n\nFiddler On The Roof is this year\u2019s most nominated production, with 13 nominations including Best Musical Revival, the Sir Peter Hall Award for Best Director (Jordan Fein), Best Actor in a Musical (Adam Dannheisser), Best Actress in a Musical (Lara Pulver), Best Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical (Raphael Papo), and two nods for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical (Liv Andrusier and Beverley Klein).

Oliver!\u2019s creatives have had a stellar year, with Matthew Bourne receiving his 14th Olivier Award nomination with a nod for Best Theatre Choreographer, and his second for a production of Oliver!, having been previously nominated in the same category for the 2010 revival; he has had a total of 9 previous wins, including a Special Award in 2019, making him the most celebrated winner in the history of the Awards. Lighting designer Paule Constable receives her 17th nomination, this year nominated for her work on Oliver! alongside Ben Jacobs; she has had 4 previous wins.\n\nIn the musical theatre performing categories, the Best Actor in a Musical nominees are completed by John Dagleish (for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, a decade after his win for Sunny Afternoon), Myles Frost (MJ The Musical, 2022 Tony Award-winner for the same role), Simon Lipkin (Oliver!) and Jamie Muscato (Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet Of 1812), alongside Fiddler On The Roof\u2019s Adam Dannheisser.

            "content": "Gen Z and millennial women in the UK are more likely than previous generations to want to start their own business, according to research commissioned by Mastercard ahead of International Women\u2019s Day 2025.\n\n63% of Gen Z[1] women in the UK and 58% of millennial[2] women have considered running their own business compared with 37% of Gen X[3] and 24% of Baby Boomers[4], the data shows.\n\nAsked about their motivations, 67% of millennials and 57% of Gen Z cited the desire to earn more money as the top reason. Other motivations that scored highly for young women include the need to achieve a better work-life balance (47% of millennial women) and wanting to pursue their passion (32% of Gen Z women).\n\nGen Z women are most likely to want to start a business in cosmetics or beauty (19%) and childcare (15%), while millennial women favour online selling (18%) and food and drink (14%).\n\nHowever, there are still barriers in place for existing and would-be female entrepreneurs. Women who have already founded a business are more likely than men to say that it\u2019s hard to balance caring for dependents with work (36% vs. 25%), that they struggle to switch off from work on holiday (47% vs. 41%), and that they don\u2019t have a good work-life balance (36% vs. 14%).\n\nAcross the UK, women are also less likely than men to say they feel confident with general business-related skills \u2013 particularly financial decision making (27% vs. 40%), networking (22% vs. 33%) and public speaking (23% vs. 32%).\n\nThis sentiment extends into running their own business. Risk of failure (31%) and lack of confidence (30%) are the most cited barriers for women when it comes to setting up their own business (vs 21% of men).\n\nTo improve their confidence, younger women are more likely to want a support network such as a mentor (23% of Gen Z and 25% of millennials vs. 19% Gen X and 16% Baby Boomers). Gen Z women are also twice as likely to want a business partner than Gen X (28% vs. 14%).\n\nPayal Dalal, Executive Vice President, Global Programmes, Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, said: \u201cIt is interesting and encouraging to see so many Gen Z and millennial women in the UK wanting to start their own business. It is good for women, good for business, and good for the UK economy. We know that starting your own business is one of the hardest things you can do and it is important that we understand where the challenges lie and address them through tailored and accessible initiatives. This is how our Strive programme was born and it has already helped more than 500,000 female entrepreneurs in the UK.\u201d",

            "content": "Mastercard Incorporated MA recently undertook a series of partnerships in a bid to solidify its presence across the Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EEMEA) region. The first move involves MA\u2019s partnership with MTN Mobile Money (\u201cU\u201d) Limited to introduce the Virtual Card by MoMo, enabling MTN MoMo subscribers in Uganda to make secure online payments without a physical card or bank account.\n\nThis initiative will allow card users to shop online, pay school fees, subscribe to streaming services and book travel experiences. With top-tier security, flexible top-ups and exclusive offers, the Mastercard-powered virtual card enhances digital transactions, empowering Ugandans to participate more actively in the digital economy.\n\nThe second collaboration involves Mastercard and one of the leading banking groups in the Middle East, North Africa and T\u00fcrkiye region, Emirates NBD. Through this collaboration, Emirates NBD will integrate Mastercard Gateway into its Emirates NBD Pay platform, positioning the former as the first acquiring bank worldwide to incorporate Mastercard\u2019s Brighterion AI technology. The move aims to enhance payment security and efficiency and pave the way for acclerated digital payment adoption across sectors like retail, hospitality and real estate.\n\nAs part of the third tie-up, Mastercard joined forces with Sadad, a leading payment solutions provider in Qatar, to unveil a digital payment gateway backed by Mastercard Gateway. By integrating Mastercard\u2019s technology, Sadad enables businesses to offer diverse payment options while enhancing security through tokenization, biometric authentication and 3D Secure. With access to more than 30 payment methods and a global network of 200+ acquirers, the partnership empowers local merchants to stay competitive and supports digital transformation efforts across Qatar.\n\nThe fourth alliance is an extension of the partnership between Mastercard and Checkout.com. By utilizing Mastercard Move\u2019s money transfer solutions, Checkout.com will empower its customers to seamlessly send funds directly to Mastercard cards with speed, convenience and security, thereby resulting in seamless disbursements and payouts for businesses and individuals in the UAE. The reach of Mastercard Move, the company's extensive suite of money transfer solutions, stretches across 180 countries and more than 150 currencies.\n\nBenefits of Such Partnerships to Mastercard\n\nFor MA, all four tie-ups are expected to fetch a mutual benefit of an expanded customer base across the region. The virtual card rolled out as a result of Mastercard\u2019s partnership with MTN is expected to attract new customers, attributable to the attractive benefits infused therein. Increased usage of the card, which carries the Mastercard brand, may boost the net revenues of the tech giant from its payment network by charging fees to customers based on the gross dollar volume of the cards. Payment network net revenues improved 10% year over year on a reported basis in 2024.",

Given that Frontier charges for both carry-on and checked baggage, the two free checked bags the card provides on every Frontier flight can easily outweigh the card\u2019s $99 annual fee. The $100 flight voucher is another great perk, effectively giving you a 4% return on the $2,500 in spending required to earn it. You can also use your card to help you earn Frontier elite status.\n\nOn the flip side, the card will be a poor fit for those who don\u2019t fly with the carrier much or don\u2019t have any plans to. Frontier miles are also worth less than the competition, at about 1.1 cents each, which places them at the bottom among our estimates for other U.S. airlines. Another downside is that Frontier miles can only be used for Frontier flights, unlike many other airline miles where you have an array of partners to choose from when you go to redeem them. Finally, you won\u2019t get as much out of your ongoing spending with this card compared to a general travel rewards card.",

            "content": "American Airlines has a boarding process with a whopping nine boarding groups. And despite the occasional sighs and eye rolls from passengers who feel their boarding group may never be called, everyone does eventually get on the airplane.\n\nHaving so many American Airlines boarding groups can be confusing, but you can use the sheer quantity of boarding groups to your advantage. Simply learn how these groups are assigned, and you can figure out how to score priority boarding for your next flight.\n\nThe 9 American Airlines boarding groups\n\nWhile officially there are nine boarding groups, in reality there's a 10th \u2014 preboarding \u2014 which happens before groups 1-9.\n\nPreboarding is reserved mainly for travelers needing special assistance and passengers with a child under age 2. Members of the airline's invitation-only, top-tier ConciergeKey elite status also get to preboard.\n\nAfter preboarding, the nine official boarding groups board in order.\n\nFor this guide, we\u2019re going to focus on Groups 5 and lower (considered priority and preferred) since boarding in any of these groups comes with interesting upsides.\n\nPriority boarding (Groups 1 - 4)\n\nThe groups are split into two boarding lanes. Groups 1 through 4 board through the priority lane, while Groups 5 through 9 board through the main lane.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nOne benefit of priority boarding (Groups 1 through 4) is skipping the line if you arrive at the gate in the midst of boarding. Just walk up the priority lane, and the gate agent will hold the main boarding group lane to admit you to your flight.\n\nYou'll also be eligible to board with Group 4 by holding the Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Executive World Elite Mastercard\u00ae. This card has an annual fee of $595) and is currently offering a welcome bonus: Earn 70,000 American Airlines AAdvantage\u00ae bonus miles after spending $7,000 within the first 3 months of account opening.\n\nPhoto courtesy of JT Genter\n\nPreferred Boarding (Group 5)\n\nAmerican Airlines preferred boarding (Group 5) includes Main Cabin Extra passengers and certain American Airlines credit cardholders.\n\nMain Cabin Extra passengers are those sitting in economy who have paid for a slightly upgraded experience, which includes seats with extra legroom, complimentary snacks and drinks (including alcoholic drinks), and free movies and TV shows. Depending on the destination, an upgrade to a Main Cabin Extra seat starts at $20.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nHolding an eligible American Airlines credit card offers another way to board in Group 5. There are two current credit cards that offer Group 5 boarding privileges. These are their annual fees and current welcome offers:\n\nCiti\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae World Elite Mastercard\u00ae (annual fee: $99, waived for first 12 months): For a limited time, earn 75,000 American Airlines AAdvantage\u00ae bonus miles after $3,500 in purchases within the first 4 months of account opening.\n\nCitiBusiness\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae Mastercard\u00ae (annual fee: $0 intro for the first year, then $99): Earn 75,000 American Airlines AAdvantage\u00ae bonus miles after spending $4,000 in purchases within the first 4 months of account opening.\n\nHow are American Airlines boarding groups assigned?\n\nAmerican passengers are put in the highest group for which they qualify. For example, basic economy passengers are typically assigned to Group 9. However, if a passenger with AAdvantage Gold elite status books a basic economy ticket, they will get upgraded to Group 4.\n\nSimilarly, a basic economy passenger with Platinum elite status will be upgraded to Group 3. And if a passenger requests a first-class upgrade and it clears, their boarding group will be elevated to Group 1.\n\nThat means there are a number of ways to upgrade your boarding position.\n\nHow to get preferred boarding on American Airlines flights\n\nRight after passengers holding tickets with priority boarding (Groups 1 through 4) get on the plane, Group 5 (preferred boarding) goes next. To board in Group 5, you either need to purchase a main cabin extra upgrade or hold an eligible American Airlines credit card.\n\nIf you have the Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae World Elite Mastercard\u00ae, Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Executive World Elite Mastercard\u00ae and the CitiBusiness\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae Mastercard\u00ae, you will board with all Group 5 passengers.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: The best airline credit cards\n\nHow to get priority boarding on American Airlines\n\nPriority boarding on American Airlines includes Groups 1-4. There are several ways you can get priority privileges \u2014 from having elite status to holding certain credit cards. Here are all of your options.\n\nFly in a premium cabin\n\nAll passengers flying in a premium cabin get priority boarding. But the group you\u2019ll be assigned to depends on which class of service you\u2019re flying.\n\nPassengers in the front cabin board with Group 1. This includes any cabin labeled first class \u2014 from first class on domestic flights to Flagship First Class on long-haul international flights. Group 1 also includes business class on international flights that don\u2019t have a first-class cabin. You\u2019ll find this on American\u2019s Boeing 777-200 and 787 aircraft.\n\nGroup 2 is mostly reserved for elite members. However, Flagship Business class passengers board during Group 2 if they\u2019re flying on a three-class aircraft. This is the case on American\u2019s Airbus A321T and its Boeing 777-300ER aircraft.\n\nPremium economy passengers also get priority boarding. If you book a premium economy ticket on one of American's internationally configured aircraft, you\u2019ll get to board in Group 4 \u2014 unless you qualify for a higher tier through another method.\n\nHold AAdvantage, Oneworld or elite status\n\nMost of the early American Airlines boarding groups are reserved for American Airlines and Oneworld elite members. No matter what tier of elite status you have, you\u2019ll get to board the flight during priority boarding \u2014 even if you\u2019re flying in economy.\n\nExecutive Platinum members can board in Group 1, while Platinum Pro (and Oneworld Emerald) members may board in Group 2. Mid-tier elites (American Airlines Platinum and Oneworld Sapphire) get at least Group 3.\n\nAnd the lowest-tier elites (American Airlines Gold and Oneworld Ruby) are assigned to Group 4.\n\nHowever, this is the lowest boarding position you\u2019ll get as an elite member. You\u2019ll get to board in a higher group if you request an upgrade and it clears.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: Guide to American Airlines elite status\n\nBoard as military\n\nMembers of the U.S. military who are on active duty and carrying a military ID can board in Group 1. This military boarding perk is the airline\u2019s way of honoring those who serve.\n\nCarry the Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Executive World Elite Mastercard\u00ae\n\nOne of the benefits of the Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Executive World Elite Mastercard\u00ae is priority boarding. Cardholders get at least Group 4 boarding \u2014 which is the last group of priority boarding. Still, this should get you on the plane early enough to find space in the overhead for your carry-on and not feel rushed by other economy passengers.\n\nBe an AirPass member\n\nAlthough discontinued in 2022, anyone who has an existing AirPass will get Group 4 boarding.\n\nPay for it\n\nIf you\u2019re unable to take advantage of any of the above ways, there\u2019s one last way to get priority boarding: Pay for it. Economy passengers, including those with basic economy fares, can purchase a priority boarding add-on to enter the plane with Group 4.\n\nYou can\u2019t purchase this upgrade during the initial booking process, so you\u2019ll need to add it during check-in, online or at the airport.\n\nFrequently asked questions How many boarding groups on American Airlines?

The new administration also recently imposed additional 10% tariffs on Chinese goods and continues to warn the European Union of similar import taxes, citing the bloc\u2019s treatment of Washington.\n\nProtectionist policies have sparked market concerns about which countries will be next on the American president\u2019s list, leaving several large multinationals unsure of how to plan. Past trends show that the broad market index dropped by 5% on days when the US, under Trump\u2019s first stint as president, announced tariffs in 2018 and 2019. The index fell by a cumulative 7% when other countries imposed retaliatory tariffs.\n\nThe recent consumer confidence survey for February has added to the negative mood, with results coming in weaker than economists\u2019 estimates and registering the largest deterioration since August 2021. This is the third straight monthly decline, pushing the index to 98.3%, its lowest since June 2024.\n\nStephanie Guichard, senior economist of global indicators at The Conference Board, stated the following about the dip:",

            "content": "At Booy South Elementary School (BSES) in Tagbilaran City, Bohol, the morning bell once signaled the start of classes in an unexpected setting \u2014 a covered court that doubled as a Grade 5 classroom.\n\nThis makeshift setup, a mark to the school\u2019s resilience, became necessary after a 2021 fire destroyed four classrooms and the principal\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThe aftermath of the fire was heartbreaking. I believe it dampened the parents\u2019 and students\u2019 hearts because the first thing they saw upon entering the school was the damage left behind,\u201d BSES principal Clementina Gamil said.\n\nDespite these challenges, BSES was determined to accommodate students. The school, which serves 372 elementary students, not only maintained its operations but excelled, garnering victories in regional press conferences and district academic competitions.\n\nHowever, the practical impact of reduced classroom capacity was evident in declining enrollment numbers, as parents prioritized their children\u2019s learning comfort.\n\nThe fire\u2019s timing also presented unique logistical challenges. It occurred in the final months of pandemic-related distance learning and less than a year away from the resumption of face-to-face classes.\n\nTo adapt, the BSES administration implemented a series of space-optimization measures, including converting the Home Economics room into a principal\u2019s office, which later had to be relocated again. The limited space made school operations even more difficult, given the vital role of a dedicated principal\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cHere, the office isn\u2019t simply considered a Principal\u2019s Office; we call it the \u2018School\u2019s Office\u2019 because it\u2019s a shared space for everyone \u2014 from DepEd guests to all the teachers and teaching staff of BSES,\u201d Gamil explained. This office serves as a collaborative room where teachers and administrators convene to enhance the school\u2019s learning experience.\n\nProviding a learning environment the community deserves\n\nSM Foundation\u2019s school building program with SM Prime has helped address these challenges by providing much-needed learning spaces.\n\nThe newly constructed two-story, four-classroom building has been strategically designed to accommodate different grade levels. The ground floor houses two kindergarten sections and two Grade 1 classes, each serving 45 students in morning and afternoon shifts. Meanwhile, the second floor provides spacious classrooms for two Grade 6 sections.\n\nThe building\u2019s design goes beyond just providing space, incorporating thoughtful features such as an information and communication technology room, a clinic, a prayer room, storage spaces, persons with disability-friendly facilities, emergency lights, and fire alarms. Its strategic location near the school gate enhances both convenience and security, particularly benefiting the younger students.\n\n\u201cWith the collaborative efforts of teachers, parents and stakeholders, we believe that we can do more and improve more with the new school building,\u201d Gamil said. The improved facilities have also enhanced teaching conditions, allowing educators to move comfortably through their spacious classrooms while delivering instruction.\n\nThrough a partnership with Mastercard Philippines, BSES received three laptops, expanding its math and technological capabilities. One unit is designated in the ICT room for the Department of Education\u2019s mathematics requirements and competitions, while the remaining two will be stationed in the School\u2019s Office to be shared by teachers and teaching staff.",

            "content": "\"In the short term, the situation is too chaotic, and the stock market will struggle to break through. I believe the market is stagnating. With liquidity improving, macro uncertainties easing, profits continuing to show resilience in USA businesses, losses stopping, and retail investors buying in again, I believe that in the medium term, the S&P 500 Index will rise and yields will decline.\"\n\nJPMorgan's Ilan Benhamou expects that, given the backdrop of worsening economic indicators, the US stock market would plateau in early March before recovering later in the Spring. He stated:\n\nSome possibilities surrounding this phenomenon include increased Christmas purchasing, holiday-fueled optimism, and investors settling their accounts before leaving for vacation. While growth is somewhat slow in February and March, the stock market often rises in April owing to the expected publication of first-quarter reports. In contrast, the period from May to October is often less positive, with first-quarter earnings having already been released and many investors spending less time paying attention to equities while on vacation.\n\nNaturally, there are a number of investing strategies based on seasonal trends. \"Sell in May and Go Away\" is one such well-known financial aphorism that refers to a stock investment strategy based on the notion that the stock market underperforms during the six months of May to October. Historical facts have usually confirmed this adage throughout the years, particularly after 1945. Furthermore, the S&P 500 generates positive returns around two-thirds of the time from May to October, increasing to 77% from November to April.\n\nSeasonality is simply a historical average of how the stock market performs over the course of the year. March has traditionally been a good month for equities, with prices rising more frequently than not and yielding a positive return on average. Furthermore, the first three months of spring often result in robust advances across all indexes. On the other side, because September is often a weak month for equities, a trader who generally takes long positions may choose to take the month off or sell their holdings earlier than normal if they begin to decrease during September.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy Before Spring . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other stocks to buy before spring.\n\nStory Continues\n\nKnowing this, more than just select companies, investors would probably be more interested in knowing what sectors of the market outperform the others during the Spring season. Thankfully, CNBC already did the heavy lifting a while back. CNBC.com looked at stock performance over the past ten years and calculated the highest average gains during the spring months of March, April and May. Of all the stocks to achieve a gain of 20 percent or more, 27 percent were in the financial sector, while 21 percent were energy-oriented.\n\nIn 2024, financial stocks outperformed the market, surpassing all other sectors. Financial markets surged sharply and widely following President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election. This spike was mostly driven by market confidence about a potentially more relaxed regulatory environment in 2025. Furthermore, Spring generally results in higher consumer spending as people receive tax refunds and engage in activities like home buying. This rise in spending may lead to increased loan demand and transaction volumes for banks and financial institutions.\n\nSeasonal demand has a substantial impact on energy sector performance as well. One clear explanation for good spring performance is the seasonal availability of renewable energy producing sources. Toward the end of 2024, energy sector equities had significant volatility, gaining by more than 6% in November before falling over 10% in December. The broader market's energy sector closed 2024 with a return of only 5.72%. Despite trailing the market last year, Spring may bring better fortune, as refineries ramp up gasoline output to match the expected increase in travel during the warmer months. This can lead to increased crude oil prices, which will boost the performance of energy equities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the best spring stocks, we selected some of the best financial services and energy firms with the most hedge fund investors in Q4 2024, and then ranked based on hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Mastercard Incorporated (MA) The Best Money Making Stock To Buy Now?\n\nA woman using a payment terminal at the checkout of a store showing payment products and solutions.\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 151\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is the world's second-largest payment processor. The company offers its clients a variety of payment processing and related services, including credit and debit cards, data analytics, settlements, payment deferrals, and more.\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) reported revenues of $7.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 14% from the same period the previous year. Compared to the previous year, the company's net income rose to $3.5 billion in the quarter. In addition, by the end of Q4, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) had issued 3.5 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards to its clients.\n\nOn February 13, Tigress Financial Partners maintained its Strong Buy rating on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and raised the price rating to $685 for the company's shares. This revision reflects Mastercard Incorporated's (NYSE:MA) stated growth and the assumption that the company would continue to benefit from the move to electronic payments and the rising demand for cybersecurity. The company's rollout of Mastercard One Credential, which streamlines numerous payment choices for consumers, is also expected to increase market share.\n\nBretton Fund stated the following regarding Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cVisa and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) kept doing their thing, increasing earnings per share by 15% and 12%, respectively, with their stocks returning 22% and 24%. We continue to closely watch the evolving payments space as it seems like everyone\u2019s always trying to displace the card networks. For now, we don\u2019t see anything gaining much traction.\u201d\n\nOverall MA ranks 2nd on our list of the best stocks to buy before spring. While we acknowledge the potential of MA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Factors in our evaluation methodology include each card\u2019s earning rates, rewards structure (such as flat-rate or bonus categories), annual fee, redemption options, promotional APR period for purchases, bonus offers for new cardholders, and noteworthy features such as insurance, loyalty bonuses or the ability to choose one\u2019s own rewards categories.\n\nHow no-fee credit cards work in Canada\n\nWhat is a no-fee credit card?\n\nA no-fee credit card doesn\u2019t have an annual fee: the lump sum amount charged by card issuers to help cover the cost of card rewards and programs. Most of the best Canadian credit cards carry annual fees over $100.\n\nNow, this isn\u2019t to say you won\u2019t ever pay any fees while holding a no-free credit card \u2014 you\u2019ll likely still need to deal with interest charges, inactivity fees and the like. But annual fees? No-fee cards don\u2019t have any, which could help you trim down on unnecessary costs.\n\nThe only downside? No-fee cards may not offer the same premium perks that often accompany cards with steep annual fees. That said, no-fee cards still have some perks, including cash-back reward programs, travel points and more.\n\nCommon features of a no-fee credit card\n\nEvery no-fee credit card is unique, so the included features will differ. That said, here are some of the common features you may get:\n\nInterest-free grace period.\n\nFraud protection.\n\nIncreased earn rate on some merchant categories.\n\nRewards (cash back, travel, store, etc).\n\nPurchase protection.\n\nExtended warranty.\n\nAdmittedly, no-fee credit cards often have fewer benefits than credit cards with an annual fee. But some no-fee credit cards may still include helpful perks, such as mobile device protection or travel insurance.\n\nIs a no-fee credit card a free credit card?\n\nA no-fee card isn\u2019t exactly the same as a free credit card. While no-fee credit cards don\u2019t charge you an annual fee, there will likely be other costs associated with using a no-fee card, including:\n\nAll of these additional fees should be clearly outlined in the terms and conditions that come with your card. As long as you use your no-fee credit card responsibly, it may be possible to avoid fees completely.\n\nDo no-fee credit cards still earn rewards?\n\nYes, there are many no-fee credit cards that earn rewards. The type of rewards you\u2019ll receive depends on what card you choose. The typical rewards categories are as follows:\n\nNo-fee cash back cards earn a percentage back in cash on purchases.\n\nNo-fee travel cards earn airline, hotel or even general travel rewards points.\n\nCo-branded no-fee store and retail cards earn store or retail rewards that can be redeemed at participating stores for groceries, merchandise and more.\n\nTypes of no-fee credit cards in Canada\n\nMany types of no-fee credit cards are available, with the best offering the ability to earn valuable rewards, cash back and more, all without having to pay an annual fee.\n\nNo-fee cash back credit cards\n\nCash-back credit cards are fairly simple as far as perks are concerned: spend money; get a percentage of what you\u2019ve spent back in cash. Now, as for the type of purchases that earn rewards and how much cash back you get for them, that\u2019s what separates different types of cash-back cards.\n\nTake the Simplii Financial\u2122 Cash Back Visa Card: it\u2019s a no-fee cash back card that offers 4% cash back each time you swipe your card at a restaurant, bar or coffee shop, up to $5,000 per year.\n\nIn comparison, the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card offers unlimited cash back at a 2% rate in up to three money-back categories of your choice.\n\nNo-fee travel credit cards\n\nTravel cards offer travel-related rewards when you use your card. Some travel cards charge large annual fees in exchange for premium perks, like comprehensive travel insurance packages.\n\nBut the rewards offered by no-fee travel credit cards are nothing to sneeze at. The CIBC Aeroplan\u00ae Visa Card doesn\u2019t carry an annual fee and earns Aeroplan points every time you spend on gas, groceries and Air Canada travel purchases, for example.\n\nAnd the BMO AIR MILES\u00ae\u2020 Mastercard\u00ae*, another no-fee card, earns Air Miles rewards and comes with car rental discounts.\n\nNo-fee rewards cards\n\nRewards cards allow you to earn points for making eligible purchases. And these points can be redeemed for all types of perks, from travel vouchers to electronic gift cards.\n\nFor example, the American Express\u00ae Green Card lets you earn rewards points across a variety of spending categories and points can be put towards purchases, travel spending, gift cards; you name it. Plus, you can transfer points to other loyalty programs, like Aeroplan and Marriott Bonvoy.\n\nNo-fee Mastercards\n\nCredit cards branded with the Mastercard name or logo belong to the Mastercard network. Mastercard is not a card issuer, it simply processes credit card payments. And because Mastercard is one of the most popular card processors in the world, there are plenty of cards to pick from \u2014 including cards without annual fees.\n\nOne example of a no-fee Mastercard with generous perks is the Brim Mastercard. It earns rewards points on everyday purchases, offers free global WiFi access and comes with travel, event ticket and mobile device insurance coverage.\n\nWho should get a no-fee credit card?\n\nA no-fee card may not be suitable for everyone, depending on their spending habits and financial goals, but there are some circumstances in which this type of card is a practical fit:\n\nYou\u2019re building your credit history. When you begin building your credit history, a card with a high annual fee may not be helpful. No-fee cards are free to carry, so they can help you focus on building your credit without having to worry about whether you\u2019re using your card often enough to justify the annual cost.\n\nYou don\u2019t use your card that often. Getting a card with an annual fee makes sense if you\u2019re able to earn more than you pay \u2014 but this tends to require more frequent use and thousands of dollars in spending. If you only anticipate using your credit card for the odd infrequent purchase, a no-fee card may be more practical.\n\nYou\u2019re seeking a secondary card. Maybe you\u2019ve already got a credit card, but you want a secondary card to double down on the points-earning process. A no-fee card might be the way to go. Or, maybe you\u2019d like a Visa to compliment your Mastercard \u2014 or vice versa. Not all merchants accept both.\n\nAdvantages of no-fee credit cards\n\nNo annual fee. As long as you\u2019re paying your balance in full and on time each month, it doesn\u2019t cost you anything to have the card.\n\nYou can keep your account open for a long time. Since it doesn\u2019t cost anything to keep the card active, your total available credit will grow, which has a positive effect on your credit utilization \u2014 one of the biggest factors in your credit score.\n\nGood for emergencies. No-fee credit cards are low-cost and low-maintenance, so they make for an excellent backup credit card.\n\nHelps you build credit. Using your credit card responsibly will build your credit history and credit score.\n\nEarn rewards. You can earn points or miles that can later be redeemed for travel or merchandise.\n\nDisadvantages of no-fee credit cards\n\nLimited benefits. Credit cards that charge an annual fee often have better benefits and higher reward earn rates.\n\nSmaller welcome bonus. No-fee cards usually have a less generous sign-up offer compared to cards with a fee.\n\nCan create high-interest debt. As with all credit cards, you could go into debt if you don\u2019t manage your spending.\n\nWhen is an annual fee worth paying?\n\nAnnual fees for Canadian credit cards can range from $6.95 to $699, and the cost may be worthwhile \u2014 it really all depends on your financial situation, lifestyle and spending habits.\n\nFor example: a travel credit card with an annual fee may be a practical fit if you\u2019re often on the road and frequently purchase travel insurance \u2014 a perk offered by numerous travel rewards cards.\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s a cash-back credit card with an annual fee that offers bonus rewards for something you spend a lot of money on, like gas or groceries.\n\nEssentially, a credit card\u2019s annual fee is worth it if the amount of value (savings or rewards) you can squeeze from the card each year is higher than the amount of the fee.\n\nHow to choose a no-fee credit card\n\nWhen comparing credit cards, assessing the annual fee they charge is typically important. Of course, with no-fee cards, this isn\u2019t a concern. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re all the same. Here are some other things to consider when deciding between no-fee credit cards in Canada.\n\nInterest rate\n\nAll credit cards \u2014 even no-fee cards \u2014 charge interest and those interest rates should factor into the card you choose. The no-fee cards on our list carry an average purchase interest rate of 20.2%, which is pretty standard. The average interest rate for a Canadian credit card in any category is 19.4%, but cards with lower rates exist, some under 10%. They\u2019re rare, but they\u2019re out there.\n\nIf you tend to carry a balance on your card, keep your eyes peeled for no-fee cards with lower interest rates \u2014 anything under 20% is a competitive rate in this category.\n\nWelcome bonus or intro offer\n\nIntroductory offers often come in the form of special cash-back offers or extra rewards points. They\u2019re designed to help incentivize new card applications and could be a factor worth considering as you narrow down your no-fee credit card options.\n\nThe caveat to welcome bonuses? You don\u2019t always get the points or cash just for signing up. To nab the intro offer, you may have to spend a minimum amount within a certain time frame after opening the card, for example. The thing to note about welcome bonuses or intro offers is that they\u2019re typically temporary, often ending after a few months.\n\nOngoing rewards rate\n\nWhen comparing no-fee card options, take a look at what type of rewards the card will earn even after the intro offer expires \u2014 more specifically, how they\u2019re earned and ways they can be redeemed.\n\nWhether you earn points from affiliated travel programs or cold hard cash back on eligible purchases, you\u2019ll want a rewards program that will encourage you to make the most of your spending.\n\nPerhaps even more important, however, is how points are earned. One card may offer triple the points on your weekly grocery bill, while another may let you double down on your travel miles each time you book a flight with a qualifying carrier.\n\nCredit card insurance\n\nSome no-fee credit cards come with insurance coverage, but not all. Insurance coverage offerings may include travel insurance, event ticket protection, extended warranty and purchase security protection and more.\n\nInsurance coverage through your no-fee credit card may not be a strict necessity if you have coverage through an independent insurer or through your employer. But it can offer added protection and peace of mind, depending on the coverage available.\n\nHow to apply for a no-fee credit card\n\nTo apply for a no-fee credit card in Canada, you\u2019ll first need to ensure that you meet the issuer\u2019s eligibility requirements, and then follow the typical steps to submit an application.\n\nEligibility requirements for a no-fee credit card\n\nEligibility criteria may vary, but the baseline requirements for a no-fee credit card tend to be fairly standard.\n\nAge and residency status\n\nYou must be a Canadian resident, and you must be the age of majority in the province or territory you live in.\n\nCredit score\n\nAll of the no-fee cards on our list require applicants to have a Canadian credit file, so if this is your first credit card, you may need to explore other options, like getting a secured credit card, instead.\n\nMinimum credit score thresholds may also come into play, depending on the card you choose.\n\nPersonal or household income requirements\n\nIncome requirements tend to be more common among high-tier credit cards, while no-fee credit card income requirements tend to be much lower, if they\u2019re required at all.\n\nSteps to apply for a no-fee credit card\n\nWhen you apply for a no-fee credit card, there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll be approved. The credit card provider needs to assess your financial profile to determine if you\u2019re creditworthy. The application process will typically look something like this:\n\nFill out an application. This can be done online or at your financial institution. The application will ask for some basic information, such as your name, date of birth, address, social insurance number, employer and income. Your information is checked. The credit card issuer will make an inquiry on your credit report and verify the information that you provided. A decision is made. If you apply online, instant approval (or disapproval) is possible, but there\u2019s also a chance the credit card issuer will ask you to contact them to provide additional information. Your card is mailed out. Your credit card will immediately be mailed out and will typically arrive within 14 business days. Activate your card. Once your card arrives, you\u2019ll need to activate it by logging into your account or calling the number on your card. Once activated, you can use your card to make purchases.\n\nCan you get a no annual fee credit card with bad credit?\n\nIt depends on your situation.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a student, some financial institutions will approve you for a no-fee student credit card even if you don\u2019t have much credit history.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have a bad credit score due to previous financial difficulties, you may not be approved for a traditional no-fee credit card. However, you may still get another type of credit card.\n\nYou would likely still qualify for a no-fee secured credit card. These types of credit cards are similar to regular credit cards, but you need to deposit security funds. These funds act as your credit limit, but you can\u2019t use them to pay your card balance.",

Factors in our evaluation methodology include each card\u2019s earning rates, rewards structure (such as flat-rate or bonus categories), annual fee, redemption options, promotional APR period for purchases, bonus offers for new cardholders, and noteworthy features such as insurance, loyalty bonuses or the ability to choose one\u2019s own rewards categories.\n\nHow cash-back credit cards work in Canada\n\nBefore deciding which cash-back credit card is right for you, it\u2019s helpful to understand how the cash-back redemption process works, the many categories cash-back rewards can fall into, and how cash-back cards compare to other types of credit cards.\n\nWhat is a cash-back credit card?\n\nCash-back credit cards are pretty straightforward: you use them as you would any other credit card, and in exchange for making eligible purchases, you get a certain percentage of what you\u2019ve spent back in cash.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of a cash-back credit card?\n\nAdvantages\n\nSimplicity \u2014 cash-back cards make it easy to earn valuable rewards.\n\nWelcome bonuses and introductory offers can be quite generous.\n\nAccumulated rewards can help pay down your card balance.\n\nHigh earn rates for items you buy regularly can yield big rewards.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nYou may not typically buy items that yield above-average earn rates.\n\nAmassing rewards can be slow depending on how much you spend each month, and whether you pay your bill in full.\n\nBonus and introductory offers tend to come with conditions, including spending minimums, which may be challenging to meet.\n\nShould I choose cash-back or rewards points?\n\nTypes of cash-back credit cards\n\nAll cash-back credit cards work similarly, but even minor differences are worth noting as they can affect your earn rate.\n\nFlat-rate\n\nThis type of cash-back credit card earns cash-back at the same rate for all purchases made.\n\nBonus rewards categories\n\nSome cash-back credit cards offer an increased earn rate for rewards on select spending categories, such as groceries and restaurants.\n\nFlexible bonus cash-back cards\n\nSome cards allow you to choose the spending categories to earn your bonus rewards. By selecting categories that align with the types of items you buy frequently, you can maximize your cash-back rewards.\n\nHow to earn cash-back\n\nYou\u2019ll need to make purchases to earn cash-back rewards with a credit card. For example, let\u2019s say you have a card that offers 2% cash back on groceries. If tomorrow\u2019s weekly run to the supermarket winds up costing you $100 and you pay with your card, you\u2019ll earn $2 in cash-back rewards.\n\nCash-back rewards will accumulate as you continue using your cash-back credit card. The running total of how much cash you\u2019ve earned should be easy to find on your monthly statement or via your online account.\n\nMake sure to stay within your credit limit, keep your account in good standing, and look closely at your cash-back credit card\u2019s details to find out how much you can earn on your purchases. Earn rates can vary based on time, such as when an introductory offer provides a higher rate of rewards and what kinds of products you purchase.\n\nHow to redeem cash-back\n\nOnce you have accumulated enough cash-back rewards, you can redeem them for statement credits, bank deposits, gift cards, or other rewards. Make sure to understand the redemption options and requirements of your card. Some may require you to meet a minimum threshold of cash-back rewards before redemption. If you don\u2019t have enough points available, you\u2019ll have to sit on them until you do.\n\nRedemption requirements by issuers\n\nEvery credit card provider has different rules when it comes to redeeming your cash back. Some allow monthly redemption, while others pay out annually. Other providers allow redemption only after you\u2019ve hit a certain threshold. The following are the payout requirements for the major cash-back credit card issuers:\n\nAmerican Express. All cash back earned is paid out annually on your September statement.\n\nBMO. Redeem as little as $1 in cash back as a statement credit. You can also set up automatic direct deposits to your BMO chequing or savings account starting at $25.\n\nCIBC. Cash-back redemptions start at $25. Any unredeemed cash back will appear on your January statement annually.\n\nRBC . Once you earn $25 in cash back, you can have the balance credited to your account at any time by calling in. Alternatively, all accumulated cash back will be credited to your account every January.\n\nScotiabank. All cash back earned appears as a credit on your November statement.\n\nTangerine. Paid monthly to your savings account or applied to your credit card balance.\n\nTD. You can redeem your cash back when you have a minimum amount of $25. Another option is to take your cash back annually every January where there is no minimum amount required.\n\n\u00bb MORE: Read our in-depth TD Cash Back Visa Infinite* Card review\n\nWhen is a good time to redeem my cash-back rewards?\n\nMany cash-back credit cards will allow you to redeem your rewards as soon as they reach a minimum threshold. But you can also save them up over time and cash them in for a more significant, single-shot pay-down of your credit card balance, for example.\n\nChoosing to redeem cash rewards on a regular basis is certainly satisfying. But it could mean dipping below your minimum threshold. The next time you want \u2014 or need \u2014 to use your rewards, you may not have enough at your disposal. Saving your cash back rewards to generate more impact \u2014 to ease the blow of a particularly big purchase \u2014 is a worthy strategy, too. But know that if you fail to keep your account in good standing or decide to close it suddenly, you could lose out on accumulated rewards.\n\nCash-back bonus rewards categories\n\nCash-back bonus rewards categories refer to the specific spending categories or types of purchases that earn higher cash-back rewards on a credit card.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say your credit card gives you 4% cash back on gas. If the card has a flat rate of 1%, this means you\u2019ll earn cash back on gas with a bonus rate of 3%, making it so all your gas purchases would give you 4% cash back. Since many gas stations sell other things, such as snacks and gift cards, you\u2019d also earn 4% cash back on any of those items.\n\nGenerally speaking, Canada\u2019s best cash-back credit cards offer multiple bonus categories. Getting a cash-back card that aligns with your spending patterns can be pretty lucrative. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries, getting a cash-back credit card with an increased earn rate on groceries can significantly benefit you.\n\nYou\u2019ll earn cash back at an increased rate when making purchases in specific spending categories, but you\u2019ll still earn the base earn rate when you make purchases that don\u2019t fall under a bonus category or after you have reached the bonus category cash-back limit. The base earn rate differs for each cash-back credit card but typically ranges between 0.5% and 2%.\n\nCommon rewards categories\n\nCash-back categories can vary depending on the credit card and issuer, but here are some common categories in Canada:\n\nGrocery. Any purchase made at grocery stores, such as Loblaws, No Frills and Metro.\n\nGas. Includes any purchase made at a gas station or service station, like Shell, PetroCanada and Esso.\n\nRestaurants and dining. This usually includes takeout and food delivery services like Uber Eats, DoorDash and SkipTheDishes.\n\nTravel spending. Airline tickets, hotels, car rentals, etc.\n\nTransit and transportation. This may include taking an Uber, a taxi, or paying for public transportation.\n\nStreaming services. Monthly subscriptions to products like Netflix, Disney+, Spotify, etc.\n\nDrug stores and pharmacies. This may include purchases made at a drug store, like Shoppers Drug Mart.\n\nEntertainment. This may include money you spend on tickets to the movies, theater, or a live music concert.\n\nBills and recurring payments. Including wireless phone, internet, and utility bills paid with a credit card.\n\nThe key thing to understand is that each credit card defines its categories differently and employs its own merchant category codes. For example, some cards may group gas and transportation. Some cards lump groceries and restaurants into a \u201cfood and drink\u201d category. To further complicate things, some merchants don\u2019t fall into the categories you would think they would. For example, Costco is not considered a grocery store. As far as credit card processors are concerned, Costco is a wholesale store.\n\nCredit card companies do not typically reveal all of the stores associated with a merchant category publicly. Still, you should be able to contact your credit card provider\u2019s customer service to ask about a specific store. Overall, it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out what category your purchases will fall under, but you may need some trial and error.\n\nHow to choose a cash-back card\n\nBefore applying for a cash-back credit card, select the right one for you and ensure you\u2019re eligible.\n\nCompare cash-back credit card options\n\nWith dozens of cash-back credit cards available, comparing them all can be time-consuming. That said, there are a few things you should look at when considering any cash-back card.\n\nInterest rates . It\u2019s important to look closely at the interest rates associated with any cash-back credit cards you\u2019re considering; many start out in the 19.99% range. Zero interest is charged on balances paid in full every month, but if you don\u2019t, it can significantly add to your debt and erode the benefit of any cash-back rewards you earn.\n\nAnnual fee . Decide if you want to pay an annual fee or not. In most cases, paying a yearly fee means earning more cash back and getting better benefits. On the other hand, no-fee cash-back cards may have a lower earn rate, but if you don\u2019t charge much to your card, you could come out ahead compared to a card with a fee.\n\nWelcome bonus or intro offer . Cash-back credit cards in Canada commonly offer a sign-up bonus for new applicants. The welcome bonus usually comes as a higher cash-back rate for a set period. For example, you might get 10% cash back on all purchases up to $3,000 in spending. If the earn rates are similar with two cards, but one has an excellent welcome bonus, then you might as well take advantage of the promotion. Credit card bonus offers nearly always come with terms and conditions to be met, but be sure you read over the offer thoroughly and understand how much you may need to spend to qualify.\n\nBonus rewards categories . The increased earn rate on bonus categories is arguably the most critical factor when comparing cash-back cards. It\u2019s ideal to choose a card that gives you the most cash-back in the categories where you do the most spending. Remember that the amount you spend in bonus categories every year could earn you more than any welcome bonus offered.\n\nCredit card insurance and additional perks. Many cash-back credit cards offer various forms of insurance and additional benefits that may appeal to you. Some perks to look out for include: Travel insurance. Roadside assistance. Mobile device insurance. Credit card concierge services. Extended warranties. Purchase protection.\n\n\n\nMake sure you qualify\n\nEven though the benefits of a cash-back credit card are relatively simple to understand, you\u2019ll still have to reckon with a few eligibility requirements to consider before applying.\n\nAge and residency status . Most cash-back credit cards require you to be both a Canadian resident and the legal age of majority in the province where you live to apply for your own card. The age of majority is 18 in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and Saskatchewan. It\u2019s 19 everywhere in all other provinces.\n\nCredit score . A good credit score is required in most cases to qualify for a cash-back credit card. In Canada, a credit score that ranges between 660 and 724 is considered good. If you do not have a good credit score, consider a credit card designed for bad or no credit, a prepaid card, or a secured credit card instead of a cash-back credit card.\n\nPersonal or household income requirements. Some cash-back credit cards come with relatively lower income requirements, but if you want a higher-tier cash-back credit card, you\u2019ll likely need a higher income.\n\nHow to maximize your cash-back rewards\n\nThere are plenty of tricks to help you get the most out of your cash-back credit cards. The more tips you adopt, the more cash back you\u2019ll earn. That said, it\u2019s best only to follow the advice that you\u2019re comfortable with.\n\nApply for a new card ahead of major expenses . Since many of Canada\u2019s best cash-back credit cards have a generous welcome bonus, it\u2019s often worth your trouble to apply for a new card before you make a major purchase. For example, let\u2019s say you need to renew your home and auto insurance, which will cost you about $2,000. You could apply for a cash-back credit card offering 10% cash back as the welcome bonus. Then, when you charge your insurance to your card, you\u2019d get $200 back.\n\nKeep your eye out for attractive intro offers and sign-up bonuses . Welcome offers are constantly changing, so watch for any current promotions. Getting 10% cash back for a set period is generous, but if the card also waives the annual fee for the first year, they\u2019re practically paying you to sign up. When you get close to 12 months of card membership, you might cancel the card before your annual fee posts. You could then apply for a new cash-back credit card with a strong bonus.\n\nPay attention to intro offer limits. Keep in mind that many cash-back credit cards have a limit on their sign-up offer. If you have a substantial purchase, you could apply for more than one card and split up your purchase to maximize your cash back. However, if you need to pay an annual fee for the new card, it may negate the cash back you earn, so pay attention to the details.\n\nCarry multiple cards . Many people focus on a single cash-back credit card, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with having multiple credit cards. In fact, having more than one card is the easiest way to maximize your cash back. Start with a primary card that gives you an increased earn rate where you spend most of your spending. You could then complement that card with a no-fee card that gives you bonus categories where your primary card doesn\u2019t. Just use the credit card that gives you the most cash back whenever you shop.\n\nBuy gift cards in bonus categories . Groceries and gas are two of the most popular merchant categories where you\u2019ll earn additional cash back. Here\u2019s the thing: grocery stores and gas stations sell gift cards that can be used at many retailers. That essentially allows you to earn extra cash back.\n\nAdd supplementary users . Most credit cards allow you to add supplementary users. The advantage is that all authorized cardholders earn cash back on their purchases, including any bonus. Best of all, the cash back gets combined into a single pool, so you\u2019ll be racking up that cash back in no time.\n\nUse cash-back websites. Various online sites allow you to earn additional cash whenever you shop online. First, you need to create an account. Afterwards, you would select the partner retailers through their online portal. When you do your shopping, eligible purchases will earn you cash back. You\u2019ll earn cash back twice if you pay with your cash-back credit card.\n\nShould I choose cash-back or rewards points?\n\nAnswering this question depends on what you\u2019re looking to get out of your credit card.\n\nCash-back rewards may be the route to take if you\u2019re hoping for a little help paying your credit card bills, or want to earn rewards that are typically easy to calculate, collect and apply toward your balance.\n\nRewards points, however, can generally be redeemed in a wider variety of ways, including discounts on travel or merchandise. That flexibility can be very attractive to some consumers. However, the value of the points you collect can fluctuate, making tracking your points a more complicated endeavour than cash-back rewards.\n\nAre cash-back credit cards worth it?\n\nThere are two situations where a cash-back card might not be the right choice:\n\nIf you\u2019ll pay more in annual fees than you\u2019d earn in cash-back. If you can get a better return with a points-based rewards card. For example, let\u2019s say you got a travel rewards credit card and did the same spending. Would the points you earn be worth more than the cash back you could potentially earn? If so, it makes more sense to get a travel credit card.",

They are accepted nearly everywhere since they are often backed by a major card network, such as Visa, Mastercard or American Express. Similar to a gift card, you add value to the prepaid debit card before you can use it, which is essentially like prepaying for future purchases. But prepaid cards come with a few more bells and whistles, like the ability to set up direct deposit and check your balance on a mobile app. They also require more attention since you can incur fees for simply having a card or reloading it with more cash. Issuers won't do a credit check when you open a prepaid card, but you also don't build a credit history when you use one. One disadvantage of using a prepaid debit card is that you can only complete transactions up to the amount you have loaded onto it. If you add $200 to your prepaid card, you can only spend up to $200. Any purchases you attempt to make exceeding $200 will be declined until you load more money onto your card. Additionally, there's often a cap on how much money you can have on your card. The cards on this list have limits ranging from $5,000 to $100,000. That said, the cap is generally pretty similar to a credit limit on a credit card.\n\nWhen you should get a prepaid debit card\n\nPrepaid debit cards are a good option for parents who want to give their kids spending money without handing them cash that could potentially get lost. You can request a new prepaid debit card if it goes missing, and many card issuers allow you to lock your card to prevent unauthorized use. And since you can incur overdraft fees with a debit card or quickly run up a balance on a credit card, a prepaid debit card can help you limit your kids\u2019 spending to the amount loaded on the card. Choosing a prepaid debit card could be a good choice for you if you have a history of overspending. A prepaid debit card might be a better alternative than a traditional debit or credit card, as it can force you to stick to a budget by declining purchases that exceed the balance in your account. But make sure it makes financial sense. Even though you're saving on potential interest charges or overdraft fees, the monthly fees on a prepaid debit card can get very expensive, too. If you decide that using a prepaid debit card makes it easier for you to manage your finances, make sure to sign up for a no-fee card.\n\nWhat to look for in a prepaid debit card\n\nWhen opening a prepaid debit card, look for the fees \u2014 card opening fee, monthly fee, cash reload fee, etc. \u2014 as well as the maximum balance limit you can have on the card. You'll also want to understand how to load money onto the card and if the issuer has a fee-free ATM network for easy access to your cash. Some cards also have benefits like cash back, which is a perk worth eyeing.\n\nPrepaid debit card vs. debit card\n\nThe main difference between prepaid debit cards and traditional debit cards is that the former is preloaded while the latter is connected to your checking account. With a prepaid debit card, you have to load money onto the card. Neither a prepaid debit card nor a traditional debit card can help you build credit, but both can help you manage your money closely. While prepaid debit cards are a good option if you don't have a checking account, and for parents who want to give their kids a limited amount of money, traditional debit cards are a good alternative for anyone with a checking account since they provide easy access to your money and don't need to be reloaded.\n\nFAQs Do prepaid debit cards come with fees? Most prepaid debit cards charge monthly maintenance fees that can be similar to checking account fees. But you may also pay a fee to open your prepaid debit card. You can also expect to incur an ATM fee, reload fee and foreign transaction fee with many prepaid debit cards. While there's typically no minimum balance requirement, you could get stuck paying a monthly fee regardless of your balance. Make sure you're familiar with your card's terms of service and reach out directly to your card issuer for more information. Where can you get a prepaid debit card? You can often find prepaid debit cards at checkout lanes when you\u2019re at the supermarket or at retailers like Walmart, typically next to gift cards. When you get a prepaid debit card in-store, you\u2019ll often incur a card opening fee. As a cheaper alternative, opt to get a card online, which is often free. How do you add money to a prepaid debit card? You can load money onto your prepaid debit card in a variety of ways, including: Direct deposit\n\nCash at the register at participating retailers\n\nTransfer from checking or savings accounts\n\nMobile check deposit You can check your account balance online, via your card issuer's mobile app or over the phone. How do you cancel a prepaid debit card? When you decide that you no longer want your prepaid debit card, whether that's because you're opting for credit or traditional debit, you'll need to take some action. You can't just forget about the card because you could still incur monthly fees. In order to cancel a prepaid debit card, you'll first need to withdraw all of the money currently in your account. You can typically withdraw money at an ATM, through a transfer to another account or by requesting a check. Once your balance reaches $0, you can call your card issuer to cancel your account.\n\nWhy trust CNBC Select?\n\nAt CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money.

So, it always felt like, due to circumstances beyond my control, I\u2019d maybe gone out with a little bit of a whimper.

And that was pretty easy for me to do because until last year I was literally never nominated for anything so now it's cool to not be in that position.\n\n\"I've always felt like an outside in the industry but in particular in the British music industry. It feels really nice to be recognised for this album when I haven't made any sacrifices.\"\n\nThe '360' hitmaker noted that she is \"living proof\" that no one needs to change themselves in order to succeed n the music industry but admitted that she is unlikely to ever do the same style of album again as she goes forward in her career.\n\nShe said: \"I've been doing my own thing in the corner of the industry for a minute. I've never really changed that, I've worked with the same incredible people and we've always been doing our thing. I guess this time round, culture caught up with us and wanted to be on the journey with us and that's really amazing.\n\n\"I would just like to share this with all artists who have ever felt that they need to compromise to be regonised and to have their moment in the sun. I am living proof that, maybe it takes a long time, but you don't need to compromise your vision.\n\n\"It's the long road but if you do your own thing and you do it well, eventually, I think if you believe in yourself enough and you make good enough music then people will resonate with you and be right there with you. Thanks to all the people who have been with me all the way.\n\n\"I feel like it's in my instincts to not do the same thing twice, so I'll probably not make a record like this again, I'll reject it and do something completely different but that's the charm of being an artist.\"",

            "content": "Lionel Ng/Bloomberg\n\nA fee dispute between Mastercard and merchants in the U.K. appears to have a resolution, a rarity in such fights, which often drag for years with settlements getting rejected.\n\nThe U.K. Competition Tribunal has approved an approximately $251 million settlement between Mastercard and Walter Merricks, the leader of a U.K. $12.5 billion class action suit in 2016 that accused the card network of overcharging consumers. The tribunal called the settlement \"just and reasonable,\" though it also said it was \"very disappointing\" compared with the original claim. Visa settled a U.K. interchange suit in 2021.\n\nVisa and Mastercard have often pushed for settlements in card-fee cases. Mastercard expressed satisfaction with the Competition Tribunal's ruling.\n\n\"We welcome the Tribunal's decision,\" said Mastercard's public relations office in an email. \"We will continue to focus on providing consumers and businesses with what they expect from Mastercard \u2014 a great payments experience, strong value and peace of mind.\"\n\nInnsworth Advisors, the firm that funded the U.K. case, did not return a request for comment on the tribunal's decision. Innsworth had challenged the Mastercard U.K. settlement, claiming it undervalued the claim.\n\nThat ends the U.K. Mastercard/Merricks battle , though payment experts say the impact likely won't travel well. If the nine-year U.K. payment fee battle sounds like a long time, it's actually relatively short when compared with a similar fight in the U.S.\n\n\"I don't think that the approval of Mastercard's settlement of a class-action suit in the U.K. will affect the prospects of settling the longstanding consolidated antitrust suit against Mastercard and Visa in the U.S. over their credit interchange fees and acceptance fees,\" Eric Grover, a principal at Intrepid Ventures, told American Banker.\n\nVisa and Mastercard have been fighting with U.S. merchants over payment fees for at least 20 years through a series of court cases, lawsuits and appeals. These skirmishes had appeared to reach a conclusion in March 2024 through a settlement in which Visa and Mastercard agreed to lower interchange , which determines the fees merchants pay for card transactions.\n\nThe card networks agreed to reduce posted interchange fees by four basis points for at least three years, with a reduction of at least seven basis points below Dec. 31, 2023, levels for at least five years. But a federal judge in June notified Visa and Mastercard that the settlement would be rejected.\n\nIn explaining his decision, the judge suggested that the card networks could make larger concessions on interchange fees. The ruling was also critical of the \"honor all cards\" rule, in which the card networks require merchants that accept one product from a network to accept all card products from that network.\n\nVisa and Mastercard expressed disappointment with the rejection of the U.S. settlement at the time, Members of the National Grocers Association and the Merchant Payments Coalition said the settlement would provide only temporary relief from fees.\n\n\"Visa and Mastercard have been trying to resolve the issue through settlements, but they keep getting thrown out by the courts, with the U.K. case being a notable exception,\" Aaron McPherson, principal at AFM Consulting, told American Banker, noting the U.K. settlement was well below the plaintiffs' claim.\n\n\"It demonstrates the limitations of the court system in obtaining meaningful relief, since [$251 million] is easily affordable by Mastercard. Legislation is needed to substantially change the policies of the card networks,\" McPherson said.\n\nThe politics of payment fees is unclear. While Donald Trump has expressed support for lower card fees, much of the pressure on card network practices has come from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whose work has been severely curtailed by the Trump administration .\n\nThere are also structural differences between the U.S. and U.K. fee disputes, Aaron Press, research director of worldwide payment strategies at IDC, told American Banker.\n\n\"The attempts to create deals with the networks in the U.S. have centered around addressing merchant harm by limiting fees and interchange increases in the future, whereas the U.K. suit was aimed at consumer harm,\" Press said. \"And with the changes at CFPB, it seems unlikely that a similar U.S. action would take place.\"\n\n",

            "content": "T PG founder Brian Kelly is a Bilt adviser and investor.\n\nBilt Rewards is a points program to help renters build credit and earn points on rent payments. The program also features a cobranded credit card.\n\nThe concept of paying rent with a credit card is not new. However, it typically involves fees of 2%-3%, which can eat up the value of any rewards you might attain in the process. Bilt Rewards doesn't charge transaction fees on rent payments if you live in a participating property or if you pay with the Bilt Mastercard\u00ae \u2014 even if your landlord doesn't accept credit cards.\n\nPlus, you can earn transferable points on these payments and other purchases with the Bilt Mastercard, which is issued by Wells Fargo and has no annual fee (see rates and fees).\n\nHere's a look at how you can earn and redeem Bilt Rewards Points, as well as considerations for whether using the Bilt Mastercard is worth it.\n\nHow many points you'll earn with Bilt\n\nWhen you pay your rent with Bilt, you earn 1 point per dollar on rent regardless of your Bilt status tier (more on this later). For instance, if you have a $3,000 monthly rent payment, you'll earn 3,000 points per month with no fees when paying through the program.\n\nYou can only earn up to 100,000 points on rent per year, but you'd have to spend over $8,000 in monthly rent to reach this cap. Thus, it will not affect the majority of renters. Plus, there's no cap on the number of points you can earn on everyday purchases when you swipe your Bilt Mastercard.\n\nWESTEND61/GETTY IMAGES\n\nYou don't need the Bilt Mastercard if your landlord is part of the Bilt Rewards Alliance, which currently comprises over four million units and includes some of the top real estate companies across the U.S., such as Brookfield Properties, Equity Residential, Starwood Capital Group and Greystar.\n\nHowever, if your landlord is not an affiliate, you'll need the Bilt Mastercard to use the app to send a monthly rent check or a direct deposit through your landlord's online portal.\n\nDaily Newsletter Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter Join over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG\u2019s experts Email address Sign up By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy . You may unsubscribe at any time.\n\nI rent from a mom-and-pop landlord, so I use the card's check-mailing feature, which arrives on time at my landlord's address every month.\n\nEarning points on everyday purchases with the Bilt Mastercard\n\nBeyond just rent, the Bilt Mastercard awards 5 points per dollar on Lyft (once you've linked your Bilt and Lyft accounts), 3 points per dollar on dining, 2 points per dollar on travel and 1 point per dollar on other purchases.\n\nThis is in addition to earning 1 point per dollar on rent payments, subject to a limit of 100,000 points per year earned from rent payments. You can read the terms of the Bilt rewards and benefits here.\n\nIt's also possible to earn double points on the first day of the month through Bilt's \"Rent Day\" promotion. This applies to nonrent spending and is subject to a 1,000-point limit each Rent Day.\n\nThese earning categories sound simple enough on paper, but some stipulations exist.\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\n\nFirst, you must use your Bilt Mastercard at least five times monthly to earn points on your purchases. If you don't, the points you've accrued will be removed from your account at the end of your statement period. This is important to note, as points are credited to your account instantly when transactions post \u2014 not when your statement closes.\n\nNext, travel is defined as airlines, hotels, cruise lines, car rental agencies and purchases made through the Bilt Travel Portal. This notably excludes ride-hailing services, taxis, public transit and other common travel expenses, so for frequent travelers and commuters, it might not replace your Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card or another card that earns bonus points on a broader selection of travel expenses.\n\nOf course, you don't need to put all of your expenses on your Bilt Mastercard to keep your points. You might consider pairing it with a card that earns bonus rewards on everyday purchases, like the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card.\n\nThe Venture Rewards earns at least 2 miles per dollar on all purchases, so you can use the Bilt Mastercard for dining and rent payments with no transaction fee and use the Venture Rewards for everything else.\n\nAZMANJAKA/GETTY IMAGES\n\nIt's also important to know that there's no welcome bonus on the Bilt Mastercard. The value proposition for the Bilt Mastercard is earning points while avoiding transaction fees on rent payments each year. Compare this to the value of points you might earn from welcome bonuses on other cards then subtract the value of fees you pay in the process.\n\nEarning 3 points per dollar with the Bilt Mastercard is lower than my American Express\u00ae Gold Card, which earns 4 points per dollar on dining at restaurants (on the first $50,000 in purchases per calendar year; then 1 point per dollar).\n\nHowever, I have been working to diversify my points portfolio, so I switch between using the Amex Gold for dining one month and the Bilt Mastercard the next.\n\nBilt Rewards status tiers\n\nUnder the initial Bilt Rewards program, your status tier was determined by how many points you earned on rent. While that's no longer the case, Bilt status tiers still exist and are based on how many points you earn in a given calendar year, with an option to fast-track status earning through Bilt Mastercard spending.\n\nHere are the various levels:\n\nBlue: Members who earn under 50,000 points or spend under $10,000 on their Bilt Mastercard in a calendar year\n\nMembers who earn under 50,000 points or spend under $10,000 on their Bilt Mastercard in a calendar year Silver: Members who earn at least 50,000 points or spend at least $10,000 on their Bilt Mastercard in a calendar year\n\nMembers who earn at least 50,000 points or spend at least $10,000 on their Bilt Mastercard in a calendar year Gold: Members who earn at least 125,000 points or spend at least $25,000 on their Bilt Mastercard in a calendar year\n\nMembers who earn at least 125,000 points or spend at least $25,000 on their Bilt Mastercard in a calendar year Platinum: Members who earn at least 200,000 points or spend at least $50,000 on their Bilt Mastercard in a calendar year\n\nNote that points earned through referrals and bonus campaigns do not count toward status. Rent payments will not count toward the spending requirements for status.\n\nSTEFANIKOLIC/GETTY IMAGES\n\nOverall, the benefits of each status tier might feel pretty minor, depending on your real estate goals.\n\nSilver members and above can earn interest on points and bonus points on qualifying activities with participating properties, while you'll need Gold status to access the homeownership concierge service, walking you through the home-buying process from start to finish.\n\nOnly Platinum members have access to a gift from the Bilt Collection, which includes home decorations and art.\n\nRelated: How to earn 'interest' on your rewards balance with Bilt\n\nRedeeming Bilt Rewards points\n\nOnce you have points in your account, you can transfer them to the following loyalty programs:\n\nSome of these transfer partners, like World of Hyatt, are valuable and make earning with Bilt Points very tempting. That said, many of these partners, like IHG One Rewards, are far less valuable.\n\nFurthermore, you can transfer American Express Membership Rewards or Chase Ultimate Rewards points to many of these programs.\n\nStill, you can maximize your Bilt rewards points by utilizing these transfer partners intentionally. For instance, you can leverage World of Hyatt for incredible value. Though the program has instituted peak and off-peak pricing, World of Hyatt has mostly stuck to a fixed award chart \u2014 which can provide fantastic pricing on luxurious hotel stays.\n\nFor example, you can book an off-peak night at the Park Hyatt New York for 35,000 points per night; on the date I checked, the nightly rate was $760.\n\nDONNA DOTAN/HYATT\n\nOf course, there are other great transfer partners here, too. Turkish Miles&Smiles provides excellent redemption values for United Airlines flights from the continental U.S. to Hawaii \u2014 or domestic flights anywhere in the U.S., for that matter.\n\nVirgin Atlantic Flying Club is a good choice for Delta One flights to Europe and ANA premium cabins when flying to Japan, while Emirates Skywards can get you a suite in Emirates' famous first-class cabin. All of this is to say that the points you earn from paying your rent can take you far.\n\nYou also have the option to redeem points in Bilt's travel portal. This involves a flat redemption rate of 1.25 cents per point, meaning 10,000 Bilt Points are worth $125 in travel. That matches the redemption rate when using points from the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card on travel purchases through Chase Travel\u2120.\n\nAs noted in our full guide to Bilt Rewards, you also can redeem points for exercise classes, items from the Bilt Collection, discounts on rent and even put them toward a downpayment on a home. That said, these will typically provide less value than transferring to a travel partner, so it's best to steer clear of those redemption options.\n\nDoes using Bilt Rewards make sense?\n\nIf you're a renter, I believe it's a no-brainer to use Bilt to pay your monthly rent. Essentially, you can earn free points for making a necessary expenditure each month.\n\nIf you live in a Bilt Rewards Alliance building, you only need to download the app to pay your rent via Bilt. If you don't, you can pick up the Bilt Mastercard and make payments through its check-sending or ACH service.\n\nThe card has no annual fee and doesn't levy any fees when paying rent. You're only charged fees and interest if you carry a balance on your card, as you would be with other credit cards.\n\nGUIDO MIETH/GETTY IMAGES\n\nThat's what makes the Bilt Mastercard potentially useful for those of us living in expensive cities like New York City and San Francisco. Rent can make up a good portion of your monthly expenses in these regions, so getting a return on that spending can be a significant consideration. If you have roommates who don't mind you putting the full rent on your card after they give you cash, you could earn even more points.\n\nOf course, you do need to make at least five purchases per billing cycle with your Bilt Mastercard to earn points. That's not an onerous requirement, though, since the card earns solid bonus points on dining purchases.\n\nI opened the Bilt Mastercard recently and, as discussed, have been putting some of my dining expenses on it each month to meet the transaction requirement. Depending on your credit card portfolio, you might want to consider doing the same.\n\nBut don't just take my word for it. If you pay rent and are considering a Bilt Mastercard, look through Bilt's selection of transfer partners and redemption options to see if it makes sense for you.\n\nOn the other hand, consider what you're giving up when you pay with Bilt. For example, someone paying their rent through Plastiq using an airline cobranded credit card that earns bonus elite-qualifying metrics may want to skip Bilt if they don't have another way to meet the spend threshold for their elite status of choice.\n\nLikewise, if you're under Chase's 5/24 application rule but getting the Bilt Mastercard would put you over it, you might want to apply for a new Chase card first and then save the Bilt Mastercard for later.\n\nBottom line\n\nWith the Bilt Mastercard's earning structure and a top-notch set of transfer partners, Bilt Rewards can be an excellent way to earn points on your rent. Just be sure to use the card at least five times per month on other purchases or you'll forfeit any points earned. For me, using Bilt to pay rent, earn points and not pay any fees absolutely makes sense.\n\nTo learn more, check out our full review of the Bilt Mastercard.\n\nApply here: Bilt Mastercard\n\nFor rates and fees of the Bilt Mastercard, click here.\n\nFor rewards and benefits of the Bilt Mastercard, click here.",

The First Progress Platinum Prestige Mastercard\u00ae Secured Credit Card is a credit-building card that offers cash-back rewards and a low APR. While it has an annual fee and requires a security deposit, no credit history or hard credit check is required, making it accessible even if you have poor or no credit. If you're looking for a credit card to help build or rebuild your credit, CNBC Select reviews some of the card's strengths and drawbacks to help you make your decision.\n\nFirst Progress Platinum Prestige Mastercard\u00ae Secured Credit Card Learn More On First Progress's site Rewards 1% cash back rewards on payments\n\nWelcome bonus None\n\nAnnual fee $49\n\nIntro APR N/A\n\nRegular APR 14.24% variable\n\nForeign transaction fee 3%\n\nCredit needed Poor/Limited/No Credit Terms apply. Pros Earns cash back rewards\n\nLow credit score requirement Cons No welcome bonus\n\nHas an annual fee Learn More View More\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nThe First Progress Platinum Prestige Mastercard Secured Credit Card does not offer a welcome bonus.\n\nBenefits and perks\n\nThe First Progress Platinum Prestige Mastercard Secured Credit Card is primarily designed to help build credit. It doesn't have a minimum credit score requirement, requires no credit history and any credit check will be a soft inquiry. The card reports to all three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion), helping you establish or improve your credit score over time. As a secured card, the First Progress Platinum Prestige Mastercard requires a minimum deposit of $200 up to an initial maximum of $2,000. The annual fee will be subtracted from the deposit. First Progress offers the option of funding your deposit in partial payments over 90 days, which can help relieve some initial financial pressure. While it's best to avoid carrying a balance, the card's APR is lower than you'd typically find in a credit card, which may lessen any potential interest. Unfortunately, the First Progress Platinum Prestige Mastercard doesn't offer an upgrade path to an unsecured card, so you'll need to apply for a different card when you're ready to transition.\n\nHow to earn and redeem First Progress Rewards\n\nEarning With the First Progress Platinum Prestige Mastercard Secured Credit Card, you will earn 1% cash back on all purchases. You will receive rewards for every dollar of payment made towards the balance on your account at the end of each billing cycle. Redeeming The cashback you earn is only redeemable for statement credits and every point is worth one cent. Once you've accumulated at least 500 points you can redeem your accrued First Progress rewards either online, via mobile app or by phone. You can only redeem rewards in increments of 500 points, and these points can not be applied to your minimum payment due, which must be paid without statement credits. First Progress rewards do not expire, but they will be lost if your account is closed for any reason.\n\nRates and fees\n\nThe First Progress Platinum Prestige Mastercard Secured Credit Card has an annual fee of $49, which will be subtracted from your initial line of credit. The card also has a 3% foreign transaction fee, a returned payment fee of up to $30, and a late payment fee of up to $41. Its variable APR is 14.24%.

The card requires a minimum deposit of $200, and according to its site, based on Q1 2024, 66% of OpenSky customers increase their score by 47+ points after 6 months. The card offers a slightly different rewards system, where you can earn up to 10% cash back on select purchases through special offers. This cashback will be automatically posted to your account as a statement credit, so you won't need to remember, or wait for a minimum amount before redeeming. Both of these secured cards have similar fee structures, offer very good approval chances, and will report your activity to the credit bureaus. The OpenSky Secured card's rewards system does offer a larger percentage, but not on all purchases like the First Progress Platinum Prestige Mastercard Secured Credit Card. Either of these cards will likely work as a credit-building card, with some differences in reward potential based on your spending habits.

Both new roles are effective May 1, Mastercard said in a news release .\n\nVerma was Mastercard\u2019s chief legal officer and head of global public policy for three years, departing in 2023 to become the State Department\u2019s chief operating officer, serving as Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources. He was also the U.S. ambassador to India from 2014 to 2017.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMastercard faces litigation on several fronts, including a 20-year-old dispute over merchant interchange fees \u2013 in which Visa is also a defendant \u2013 and class-action lawsuits from ATM operators regarding the surcharges they can assess. Mastercard has also confronted a civil probe by the Justice Department since March 2023 over its debit card practices.\n\nVerma \u201chas had a unique view on the topics impacting people and economies across the globe,\u201d Mastercard Chief Executive Michael Miebach said in the release announcing the new roles for Murphy and Verma. \u201cOur business and our customers will benefit from his extensive experience and leadership in many ways.\u201d\n\nIn his administrative role, Verma will oversee Mastercard\u2019s law, government affairs & policy; franchise; corporate security; inclusion and belonging; and transformation, risk and operations functions.\n\nHe\u2019s likely to be busy.\n\nMastercard, along with Visa, faces multiple lawsuits from U.S. merchants, stretching back 20 years, alleging that the companies conspired on interchange fees and imposed other point-of-sale rules that resulted in the merchants overpaying for accepting the networks\u2019 cards.\n\nThe company also faces similar merchant complaints in the U.K. and European Union.\n\nMastercard is also working with federal antitrust regulators on a civil investigation of its debit cards. In September, the Justice Department sued Visa over its debit-card processing practices, alleging the company operated an illegal monopoly in that market and suppressed potential competitors.\n\nRegulators had been examining Mastercard over similar issues, although no case has been brought to date, and it\u2019s unclear how the Trump administration will pursue the Visa litigation, which was brought by the Biden administration under the Sherman Act.\n\nVisa processes more than 60% of U.S. debit card transactions, while Mastercard is \u201ca distant second,\u201d handling less than a quarter of those transactions, according to the government\u2019s lawsuit. Visa also leads Mastercard in the credit card market.\n\nThe company, based in Purchase, New York, had accrued $930 million for legal liabilities as of Dec. 31, including $559 million for the U.S. interchange fees litigation, according to its annual report.\n\nMastercard\u2019s inclusion efforts may also draw federal scrutiny.\n\nAs part of his second term, President Donald Trump has targeted diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the private sector, a campaign that has ensnared numerous large U.S. companies.

This helps build trust and loyalty with customers, reduces cart abandonment, and creates a seamless shopping experience.\u201d\n\nThe service was rolled out last month for merchants in Germany, with plans to bring it to other European markets later in the year.\n\nUnzer and Mastercard formed their collaboration in November, with Mastercard becoming Unzer\u2019s open banking partner in Germany, Austria and Denmark.\n\nThe aim, the companies said at the time, is to enhance open banking account-based payments and power eCommerce payments on Unzer\u2019s payment gateways.\n\nIn other pay-by-bank news, PYMNTS wrote earlier this week about the payment method\u2019s use in sports betting, where speedy payouts and frictionless deposits and transactions are critical to the user experience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating for a player to deposit money [on one site] and then have it [stuck] there for three to five days because of processing times,\u201d John Parsons, vice president of gaming at Trustly, said in an interview with PYMNTS.\n\nAs that report notes, consumers get same-day delivery of groceries and other items or stream an entire TV season in one sitting, making the notion of waiting days for a payout or a deposit to settle seem outdated. This is particularly true for sports bettors, whose entire experience is centered around the rush of the moment.\n\n\u201cAs more consumers become comfortable with digital banking, pay-by-bank solutions are also gaining traction in the sports betting world,\u201d PYMNTS wrote.",

            "content": "Mastercard Foundation has pulled out of a commitment to invest $100 million in a leading African venture capital firm at a time when tech startups on the continent are struggling to woo Western funders.\n\n54 Collective, the most active investor in Africa in 2024, and Mastercard Foundation, an international nongovernmental organization, \u201cwill be pursuing different strategies moving forward, and the partnership will end on 30 April 2025,\u201d the VC firm told Rest of World in an email.\n\nWe are left with a bit of a vacuum.\n\nDuring an internal meeting on February 20, the leadership team of 54 Collective (formerly Founders Factory Africa) told staff this would result in layoffs as the firm will disband its entire venture studio team, which includes staff that supports its portfolio companies on product, technology, marketing and growth, human resources, and business development, three senior company officials who attended the meeting told Rest of World, seeking anonymity as they were not authorized to talk to the media.\n\n\u201cStartups currently in the program will continue receiving technical support from the 54 Collective Venture Studio until April 30, 2025,\u201d Daniel Hailu, executive director of pan-African programs at the Mastercard Foundation, told Rest of World in a statement. \u201cThe Mastercard Foundation remains committed to its Young Africa Works strategy to see 30 million young people, especially young women, access dignified and fulfilling work by 2030.\u201d\n\nStartup funding in Africa has been declining since 2022, and entrepreneurs and investors worry this development could further hurt the overall investment sentiment.\n\nBesides its immediate impact on the team at 54 Collective, a development like this leaves a big vacuum in the ecosystem, Alim Ladha, founder and CEO of South African edtech company Instill Education, told Rest of World.\n\n\u201cI think the short-term effect of a development like this is obviously that there will be value destructions,\u201d Ladha said. \u201cMost of the ventures [built or supported by this fund] may not be at a stage where they\u2019re self-sustaining. From an ecosystem perspective, we are left with a bit of a vacuum and who plays that role of coming in and stimulating in the absence of such a deal?\u201d\n\nIyinoluwa Aboyeji, managing partner at startup accelerator Accelerate Africa and co-founder of fintech unicorn Flutterwave, told Rest of World it was \u201ctime for our ecosystem to stop building on the broken promises and broken mandates of globalist institutions and foundations who would rather keep African founders broke and broken.\u201d\n\nSeveral international investors pulled out of Africa during the 2022 funding crunch and have since never returned to the continent. For instance, Tiger Global invested in five African startups in 2022 but has not announced any further bets on the continent.\n\nIn 2024, investment in African startups fell 25% year on year to $2.2 billion.\n\nFounded in 2018, 54 Collective is headquartered in South Africa and has invested in over 70 startups.\n\nThe firm combines venture studio and venture capital models by providing investment as well as mentorship to early-stage founders in Africa. It partners with large corporate organizations and impact investment firms to deliver its services. The company\u2019s partners include South Africa\u2019s Standard Bank, South African health-care company Netcare, and the Dublin-headquartered Small Foundation, among others.\n\nIn August 2023, 54 Collective secured its largest funding when Mastercard Foundation and Johnson & Johnson Impact Ventures committed to investing $114 million into the VC firm to scale its \u201cunconventional VC model\u201d and better serve founders across Africa. Under the agreement, 54 Collective would receive $20 million per year from the Mastercard Foundation over five years.\n\nIn its email to Rest of World, 54 Collective said the Mastercard Foundation funding was pivotal to its business. While senior executives said the company is likely to reduce its core investment team across its offices in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, the firm said it will continue to invest as usual.\n\nMastercard and Mastercard Foundation have extensively invested in tech ventures in Africa in recent years. Last year, Rest of World reported how Mastercard invested in at least three big African companies including Jumia, Airtel Africa, and MTN Mobile Money.\n\nVictor Asemota, partner at VC firm AnD Ventures, told Rest of World last year that Mastercard and its rival Visa opened Africa to the world and improved how business is done on the continent. \u201cBefore them, there was a lot of chaos,\u201d Asemota said. \u201cI remember when Interswitch launched their failed magstripe cards without EMV [Europay, Mastercard, and Visa] standards. It was chaotic. Visa and Mastercard brought sanity.\u201d\n\nMastercard Foundation runs Africa Growth Fund \u2014 a fund of funds through which it supports small and medium enterprises on the continent \u201cwith the goal of enabling dignified and fulfilling work for young people, particularly young women,\u201d according to its website. Besides 54 Collective, Mastercard Foundation has invested in at least five other investment vehicles in Africa, including Nigeria\u2019s VestedWorld and Aruwa Capital Management, and Kenya\u2019s Chui Ventures.\n\nLadha said this development should remind Africans to \u201cstop building businesses that are dependent on the whims of philanthropies around the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cA few years ago, maybe before Covid[-19], the most important thing that all these philanthropist funders talked about was education and youth employment. And then it was food security driven by the food crises during Covid[-19]. Then it was agritech, then it was climate tech,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think the reality of it is all of us have just realized that building a business, relying on philanthropy to be the reason we sustain is not a sustainable model for our continent.\u201d",

            "content": "Mastercard\u2019s newly launched One Credential is a one-stop digital solution aimed at giving users greater control over how they pay, including use of prepaid cards, debit cards, credit cards, and buy now pay later (BNPL). Mastercard is aiming to cater to increasing consumer demand for control, flexibility, and choice\u2014particularly among Generation Z users.\n\nGlobalData 2024 Financial Services Consumer Survey\n\nGeneration Z consumers, often referred to as \u201cdigital natives,\u201d are far more likely to prefer innovative payment solutions than other generations. According to GlobalData\u2019s 2024 Financial Services Consumer Survey, 43% of global consumers aged 18 to 29 prefer to use new and innovative payment experiences, compared with the population average of just 35%. Furthermore, the survey shows that younger consumers are 4pp more likely than average to prioritise a quick and easy payment solution over privacy and security.\n\nThis highlights that younger consumers are more adventurous and less-risk averse than other generations, making embedded finance solutions such as Mastercard\u2019s One Credential more attractive to these users.\n\nMoreover, younger consumers have a lower level of credit card use than other generations, with only 65% of 18\u201329-year-olds holding at least one credit card, compared with 77% across the rest of the population. This lower penetration rate presents an opportunity for Mastercard to attempt to capture consumers from this demographic by providing a convenient, embedded credit card solution. Younger users are less likely to have a high and stable income, making them more averse to using credit cards due to the difficulty of staying within spending limits and budgeting. The ability to set limits within the One Credential app reduces the risks associated with overspending, potentially increasing the attractiveness of this solution among younger consumers.\n\nGlobalData Buy Now Pay Later Analytics\n\nWhile not marketed exclusively toward Gen Z consumers, One Credential is Mastercard\u2019s reply to payment solutions such as BNPL offered by competitors such as Klarna and Afterpay, which are most popular among younger users. According to GlobalData\u2019s Buy Now Pay Later Analytics, 2024 was the first year in which the majority of consumers (51%) had used a BNPL tool, highlighting its continued growth across markets and demographics. Furthermore, the amounts borrowed by consumers are increasing year on year, suggesting that trust continues to grow among users.\n\nBy offering instalments alongside debit, credit, and prepaid options, Mastercard users will be able to pay for large purchases over a series of payments, increasing the value of transactions processed through the Mastercard network, thus generating higher revenue for the firm through fees. The integrated payment solution allows users to select their preferred payment option based on the value of the purchase they are making, making it easier for users to budget and take advantage of access to credit.\n\nBy addressing the needs of Generation Z, Mastercard hopes to capture these consumers at the beginning of their financial journey. While younger consumers are unlikely to need to use all the payment tools offered by One Credential, many will find the use of BNPL and prepaid cards useful for budgeting and money management.\n\nAs they mature and their financial needs become more complex, users will be more attracted to debit cards and credit cards, providing higher transaction fees for Mastercard as consumers\u2019 income grows and becomes more stable, facilitating higher spending and higher borrowing. This strategy is likely to increase consumers\u2019 lifetime value for Mastercard, as well as providing material benefits to users in the form of greater control, increased convenience, and seamless access to multiple payment tools.",

            "content": "Seeing an opening after the shuttering of Paydirekt last year, German payment solutions provider Unzer is introducing Unzer Direct Bank Transfer, a pay-by-bank service and the first product in its collaboration with Mastercard.\n\nThe new service leverages open banking to offer what Unzer hopes will be a simple payment experience, using existing bank authentication methods such as biometric verification. Currently available only to merchants in Germany, it is designed to work across all SEPA countries. Unzer plans to expand into additional European markets later this year.\n\nAdditionally, Unzer will offer a white-label option, allowing merchants to customize the checkout process to match their branding.\n\nChanges to the Competition\n\nUnzer is positioning its product as a replacement for Paydirekt, the German initiative launched in 2015 as Europe\u2019s answer to PayPal. Owned by a consortium of German banks, Paydirekt shut down in June 2024 after being overtaken by the European Payments Initiative (EPI), which is backed by the European Central Bank. EPI\u2019s stated goal is to build a unified payment system for Europe, featuring a digital wallet that supports account-to-account instant P2P and consumer-to-business payments, with plans for online, mobile, and point-of-sale transactions.\n\nThat\u2019s a retrenchment from its original plans. When it first launched, EPI aimed to offer credit cards and position itself as a rival to Visa and Mastercard. However, it scaled back after more than half of its member banks withdrew from the project in 2022. The fact that Unzer is now teaming up with Mastercard illustrates how difficult it is for a European entity to overtake these payment giants.\n\nThat said, it remains to be seen how much of a market there is for a new open banking solution in Europe. Paydirekt\u2019s flagship service, Giropay, never really caught on. According to data from the EHI Retail Institute, Giropay commanded just 1.2% of all online payments, even within Germany.\n\nAnother potential rival in the open banking space, Sofort, was integrated into Klarna last year, meaning Unzer will now face competition from the Swedish fintech. The competitive advantage here lies in simplicity. To use Klarna, end customers must install its app, but Unzer hopes they will find the open banking rails provided by Mastercard easier and more straightforward to use.",

If you won't earn points on rent and don't spend heavily on travel and dining, the Citi Double Cash has the potential to be more rewarding.

Bilt points are also valuable and Bilt's monthly Rent Day promotion offers opportunities to dramatically boost that value and earn additional points. However, if you own your home or otherwise don't pay rent, the value of this card drops. If you're not earning points on rent, this card is still as good as many of the best travel credit cards, but it doesn't stand out. Plus, it doesn't have a welcome bonus, which means you're missing out on the opportunity to earn hundreds of dollars in value that you'd have with many other cards in this class.\n\nSubscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!

            "content": "Everyone is familiar with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin \u2014 digital assets with no physical equivalent that live on a decentralized ledger called the blockchain. But what about putting real-world assets on the blockchain?\n\nThat\u2019s the idea behind Mastercard and Ondo Finance's latest partnership, which will make institutional financial assets, such as funds that invest in U.S. Treasuries, available in digital form. Now, Ondo is joining Mastercard\u2019s Multi-Token Network (MTN), a blockchain that links commercial banks with digital assets that can be transferred securely any minute of any day.\n\nBlockchain technology has the potential to transform the way businesses pay one another. Even in 2025, the complex work of settling the world\u2019s business transactions sometimes requires waiting several days as banks communicate and sync their accounts with each other. Blockchains, on the other hand, can quickly process and settle transactions any time of day, any day of the week.\n\nThe Mastercard Newsroom recently chatted with Ian De Bode, Ondo\u2019s chief strategy officer, about what this news means for users of MTN and how digitizing real-world assets opens up the blockchain to more participants.\n\nMore banks and asset managers are tokenizing traditional financial assets, such as investment funds or even gold, allowing them to be traded on a blockchain. What\u2019s the value of creating a digital copy of these assets?\n\nDe Bode: When you put a traditional asset, such as an investment security, on the blockchain, you enable transactions around the clock, and you can integrate it into smart contracts. You can do that without centralized counterparties. You\u2019re not reliant on the infrastructure of traditional financial services, which do not work 24/7 and tend to be pretty siloed.\n\nWhat we're most known for is tokenizing U.S. Treasuries products. We have issued these assets in such a way that it enables free peer-to-peer transfers, no stock exchange needed. It pays out a yield very similar to the short-term Treasuries rate with all the investor protections that you would expect in traditional finance.\n\nOndo\u2019s product sounds very much like the kind of exchange-traded fund, or ETF, that personal investors might buy to earn some yield on their savings with little risk. How does a blockchain-enabled version differ?\n\nDe Bode: While comparing it to a Treasury ETF is fair, I would think of it more like a money market fund \u2014 a means for institutions to invest cash short-term \u2014 that we've put on the blockchain. Because our assets live on a blockchain and not some centralized exchange, they can move more freely. If you're ever looking to use it as collateral on the blockchain, you can do that across a wide variety of applications. You're not just locked into one specific provider the way you would be if, for example, you want to borrow against your holdings in a brokerage account. From the perspective of crypto investors, the blockchain is a challenging place to get access to normal Treasury yields.\n\nHow do businesses or institutions benefit from your products becoming available on the Multi-Token Network?\n\nDe Bode: Some institutions prefer to keep all of their assets with traditional banking, but if they want to access the blockchain with, say, the cash they have at their bank, they run into problems. Bank infrastructure doesn't operate 24/7. The blockchain does. For time-sensitive transactions, such as overnight borrowing, that matters. You're running into liquidity mismatches between your blockchain infrastructure and your settlement infrastructure.\n\nThe beauty of the Multi-Token Network is that it operates 24/7, so by connecting our products to it, customers can use the traditional banking they feel comfortable with but access a blockchain financial product much more simply. If someone wants to then take their digital assets and redeem them for cash, that's something that the MTN also easily enables. What makes this partnership meaningful is that it enables settlements across various banks round the clock, on traditional financial rails and for many institutions.\n\nWhat developments do you expect to see for crypto and blockchain in 2025?\n\nDe Bode: I expect investment vehicles to move to blockchain a lot faster than people think. My bold prediction is that we will see tokenized stocks, ETFs and the ability to borrow against them on-chain. A lot of people right now are just focused on crypto, stablecoins, maybe tokenized Treasuries. I actually think other deeply liquid assets that are readily available on traditional exchanges are going to find their way onto public blockchains significantly faster than many people believe.",

            "content": "Mastercard: This Entrepreneur Is Transforming His Professional Capital Into a Springboard to Financial Inclusion\n\nPublished 02-26-25 Submitted by Mastercard\n\nMastercard\n\nMost entrepreneurs dream of tapping into the kind of capital, industry connections and sophisticated software that Martin Naor has at his fingertips.\n\nThe Uruguayan entrepreneur has certainly benefitted from a full career that took him from managing products and businesses for Microsoft to sitting on company boards, investing in startups and running the Montevideo-based tech firm Infocorp.\n\nYet launching a new business is always a twisty road, and Naor had his share of unforeseen curves when he started his fintech Bankingly a decade ago.\n\nBankingly was born from a flash insight. Naor noticed that while major banks were proactively building tech solutions to drive their digital transformation, smaller institutions were struggling to migrate online.\n\nHe also understood how transformative digital banking could be for people living Latin America, where one in five adults are still unbanked and many of those who are still spend hours travelling to their bank branch.\n\nSo he created a venture to provide smaller banks and credit unions from Argentina to Mexico \u2014 and more recently, Kenya and Nigeria \u2014 with the software they need to offer digital banking services.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to sell to the big boys,\u201d says Naor, 53. \u201cWe decided the big blue ocean of opportunity was on small and medium-sized financial institutions in emerging markets.\u201d\n\nRather than start from scratch, he launched Bankingly as a Infocorp spin-off so he could piggyback off the company\u2019s products and experiences and reach the market quickly with a segment-friendly offering of low start-up costs and per-usage charges.\n\nWhat he did not foresee was the hesitancy. Back in 2015, many of the smaller banks Naor approached saw little reason to start offering online banking to their customers. They preferred relying solely on tried-and-tested traditional branch banking.\n\n\u201cThey were less anxious to digitalize than we expected. My na\u00efve starting point was that if I put an affordable, scalable solution in front of them, they\u2019ll jump at it,\u201d he admits.\n\nHe quickly realized he needed to tweak Bankingly\u2019s business model and spend its capital wisely so he could take the time to show banks and credit unions the benefits of digitalization, plus convince regulators its cloud-based systems were secure.\n\nDespite the slow start, financial institutions who started using Bankingly\u2019s apps and platforms soon saw their customers were more likely to deposit their salaries, build up savings and increase their card transactions.\n\nTen years down the road, Bankingly has 120 clients in 20 countries who use its cloud-based solutions to provide some 4 million customers with digital services from onboarding to payment transactions and loan applications.\n\nMore importantly, by giving millions of people across Latin America and in Africa access to accounts from their smartphones, Bankingly is playing a role in significantly helping boost financial inclusion in the region. A 2023 Mastercard survey on financial inclusion in Latin America showed that 79% of adults had a bank account in 2023, as opposed to 52% in a report from 2014.\n\nBut just 40% of people outside of major cities and 59% of people from low-income households held bank accounts, according to the same study, so more still needs to be done to broaden access to those who have traditionally been excluded.\n\nFor Bankingly, joining Mastercard Start Path, the company\u2019s award-winning startup engagement program, in October will help speed up emerging market digitalization and offers a chance to potentially acquire new clients who can reach those unbanked people, including the ability to offer credit cards to their customers for the first time.\n\nMotivated by the opportunity to open up financial services for more underserved communities and small businesses, Naor hopes Bankingly\u2019s growth will mean more than 5 million people are using its software within two years.\n\nAs he firmly believes, \u201cDigital financial services can really change lives.\u201d\n\nOriginally published by Mastercard\n\nFollow along Mastercard's journey to connect and power an inclusive, digital economy that benefits everyone, everywhere.",

            "content": "Mastercard Inc.\u2019s One Credential, just announced last week, already is seeing some recruiting success with payments-technology provider i2c Inc. enrolling as one of the first issuing-processing partners.\n\nThe Mastercard One Credential is a digital-payment service that supports multiple payment methods, such as credit, debit, and prepaid, as well as installment loans, on a single card.\n\nA One Credential user can opt to pay for household expenses using her checking account and pay for larger purchases using an installment loan. Users can also set dollar-amount limits that trigger the account that will be used to pay for a purchase, such as any purchase over $100 automatically being charged to the user\u2019s credit card. Users can set their preferences online or through the One Credential app, which also provides an overview of users\u2019 spending.\n\nParticipating as a One Credential partner will help i2c\u2019s issuing customers, the company says. \u201cThe real advantage for issuers lies in preparing payment infrastructure now\u2014before these capabilities become the industry standard,\u201d Amir Wain, i2c founder and chief executive, says in a statement. \u201cBy offering a seamless, personalized payment experience, issuers can foster deeper customer relationships, drive higher transaction volumes, and stay ahead in a market where choice and convenience are paramount.\u201d Mastercard and i2c have been partners for more than 20 years.\n\nVisa Inc. has a similar product, the Visa Flexible Credential.\n\nIn other Mastercard news, blockchain-technology firm Ondo Finance says it joined the Mastercard Multi Token Network. That service connects financial institutions with businesses to improve cross-border payments, Ondo says.\n\nOndo will integrate real-world assets\u2014defined as tokenized versions of tangible assets that exist in the physical world, according to CoinGecko.com\u2014into the Multi Token Network. Ondo says this marks one of the first live instances of connectivity between a private payments network and tokenized assets on public blockchains.\n\nIn yet more Mastercard news, the card network says Richard R. Verma, who originally joined the company in 2000, has returned as chief administrative officer. Verma was one of the lead lawyers when Mastercard became a publicly traded company in 2006.\n\nMastercard also moved Tim Murphy, whom Verma is replacing, to the vice chair position. Both positions are effective May 1.",

            "content": "Wasn\u2019t long ago that navigating between accounts and payment options was largely a matter of juggling between physical, digital, prepaid and credit cards, pulling them out of wallets as needed. But the rise of digitally native consumers \u2014 especially within the younger generations that have had access to mobile devices almost from the cradle \u2014 has created a shift in payments.\n\nAs Bunita Sawhney, chief consumer product officer at Mastercard, reminded PYMNTS in a recent interview, the pandemic hastened these changes as digital wallets, tap to pay and other technologically driven options have become ubiquitous.\n\nNow who will use them? As for populations that are most receptive to new ways to pay, Gen Z represents 25% of the world\u2019s population, with $7 trillion in purchasing power. They\u2019re demanding \u2014 as are other generations \u2014 broadening range of payments and financial solutions from their primary banking relationships.\n\nThe majority of consumers, Sawhney said, \u201chave a high desire to have tools that help them become strong and confident money managers.\u201d Key to that goal is having visibility and transparency into, and control over, cash flows.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, last week, Mastercard launched its Mastercard One Credential, through which consumers choose between debit, installments, prepaid or credit options. Mastercard\u2019s initial approach with the credential focuses on Gen Z as the \u201ctarget\u201d that helped shape the design, because they are digitally savvy, Sawhney said, but the desire for control and payments choice is universal.\n\nUsers can set their payment preferences online or in an app, with those preferences defined along transaction limits \u2014 for example, users can specify their checking account for expenses under $100, their credit card for expenses over $100, and installments for occasional larger purchases.\n\nUsers, she said, \u201cmight want situational transactions to go towards credit \u2014 whether a revolving credit card or BNPL \u2014 because they want to be careful to smooth out how their cash flow is working over the course of the month.\u201d\n\nFor the issuing banks, Sawhney said, there\u2019s the advantage of offering a tool that gives customers clarity and transparency into their financial journeys and planning their financial futures with a credential that, she said, \u201ccan grow with them across their life stages.\u201d\n\nAs she noted to PYMNTS, \u201cthis is a great way for consumers to have a healthy interaction with debit and credit products.\u201d\n\nSMB Opportunity\n\nThe rollout will also, down the line, include One Credential options for small businesses. A majority of small business owners are sole proprietors or gig workers, Sawhney said, and they still use their personal accounts to manage money. The credential will help them make sure they can budget and compartmentalize their spend as they run their businesses \u2014 with the thresholds here based on types or stores (as they purchase supplies or inventory, for example).\n\nAsked about the time frames for the rollouts, she noted that Mastercard will be working with financial institutions to help them prepare to offer the credential to end users (the offering is already available in the UAE).\n\n\u201cThe idea is to help the financial institution optimize the experience with their customer or the small business owner with the accounts that they already have,\u201d Sawhney said. \u201cWhat we bring to market in the United States may be a little different that what we do in Australia versus the U.K., based on regulatory conditions and requirements. We want to make sure that we do this at scale and in compliant fashion.\u201d\n\nAs she told PYMNTS, the Mastercard One Credential has been designed for \u201can informed consumer who wants more tools in their hands to help make sure they are making smart choices that will set them up for financial success.\u201d",

            "content": "Mastercard: This Entrepreneur Is Transforming His Professional Capital Into a Springboard to Financial Inclusion\n\nBy Sophie Hares\n\nFeb 25, 2025 9:00 PM ET\n\nMastercard\n\nMost entrepreneurs dream of tapping into the kind of capital, industry connections and sophisticated software that Martin Naor has at his fingertips.\n\nThe Uruguayan entrepreneur has certainly benefitted from a full career that took him from managing products and businesses for Microsoft to sitting on company boards, investing in startups and running the Montevideo-based tech firm Infocorp.\n\nYet launching a new business is always a twisty road, and Naor had his share of unforeseen curves when he started his fintech Bankingly a decade ago.\n\nBankingly was born from a flash insight. Naor noticed that while major banks were proactively building tech solutions to drive their digital transformation, smaller institutions were struggling to migrate online.\n\nHe also understood how transformative digital banking could be for people living Latin America, where one in five adults are still unbanked and many of those who are still spend hours travelling to their bank branch.\n\nSo he created a venture to provide smaller banks and credit unions from Argentina to Mexico \u2014 and more recently, Kenya and Nigeria \u2014 with the software they need to offer digital banking services.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to sell to the big boys,\u201d says Naor, 53. \u201cWe decided the big blue ocean of opportunity was on small and medium-sized financial institutions in emerging markets.\u201d\n\nRather than start from scratch, he launched Bankingly as a Infocorp spin-off so he could piggyback off the company\u2019s products and experiences and reach the market quickly with a segment-friendly offering of low start-up costs and per-usage charges.\n\nWhat he did not foresee was the hesitancy. Back in 2015, many of the smaller banks Naor approached saw little reason to start offering online banking to their customers. They preferred relying solely on tried-and-tested traditional branch banking.\n\n\u201cThey were less anxious to digitalize than we expected. My na\u00efve starting point was that if I put an affordable, scalable solution in front of them, they\u2019ll jump at it,\u201d he admits.\n\nHe quickly realized he needed to tweak Bankingly\u2019s business model and spend its capital wisely so he could take the time to show banks and credit unions the benefits of digitalization, plus convince regulators its cloud-based systems were secure.\n\nDespite the slow start, financial institutions who started using Bankingly\u2019s apps and platforms soon saw their customers were more likely to deposit their salaries, build up savings and increase their card transactions.\n\nTen years down the road, Bankingly has 120 clients in 20 countries who use its cloud-based solutions to provide some 4 million customers with digital services from onboarding to payment transactions and loan applications.\n\nMore importantly, by giving millions of people across Latin America and in Africa access to accounts from their smartphones, Bankingly is playing a role in significantly helping boost financial inclusion in the region. A 2023 Mastercard survey on financial inclusion in Latin America showed that 79% of adults had a bank account in 2023, as opposed to 52% in a report from 2014.\n\nBut just 40% of people outside of major cities and 59% of people from low-income households held bank accounts, according to the same study, so more still needs to be done to broaden access to those who have traditionally been excluded.\n\nFor Bankingly, joining Mastercard Start Path, the company\u2019s award-winning startup engagement program, in October will help speed up emerging market digitalization and offers a chance to potentially acquire new clients who can reach those unbanked people, including the ability to offer credit cards to their customers for the first time.\n\nMotivated by the opportunity to open up financial services for more underserved communities and small businesses, Naor hopes Bankingly\u2019s growth will mean more than 5 million people are using its software within two years.\n\nAs he firmly believes, \u201cDigital financial services can really change lives.\u201d\n\nOriginally published by Mastercard\n\nFollow along Mastercard's journey to connect and power an inclusive, digital economy that benefits everyone, everywhere.",

Businesses see seamless supplier payments (89%), more efficient multi-channel transactions (87%), and quicker access to revenue (72%) as the most significant advantages of digital payments.\n\n\u201cSmall and medium enterprises are the backbone of economies, driving innovation, employment, and resilience. As digital transformation accelerates, SMEs are unlocking new opportunities through digital payments and financial inclusion. Their ability to adapt and grow in a rapidly evolving business landscape reflects the strength of an ecosystem that prioritizes access to finance, digital enablement, and sustainable growth,\u201d said Dimitrios Dosis, president Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, Mastercard.\n\n\u201cAs South Africa's SMEs continue to adapt to a rapidly evolving economy, digital payments, sustainability, and cybersecurity are becoming key priorities for growth. At Mastercard, we are dedicated to providing businesses with the tools, insights, and secure payment solutions they need to scale, improve efficiency, and build resilience. Through strategic partnerships and financial education initiatives, we aim to support SMEs in navigating challenges and seizing new opportunities in the digital economy,\u201d said Mark Elliott, division president, Africa, Mastercard\n\nDigital payments at the core of SME expansion\n\nAs South Africa's economy continues to digitalize, SMEs are increasingly recognizing the benefits of digital transactions in enhancing business efficiency. Many business owners emphasize the simplicity of payment management, smoother supplier transactions, and quicker access to revenue as key advantages of adopting digital payments.\n\nLooking ahead, 79% of SMEs aim to expand their digital payment capabilities across multiple channels, while 62% prioritize sustainability initiatives and 60% focus on enhancing cybersecurity to strengthen their businesses. As confidence in growth remains steady, 74% of South African SMEs anticipate maintaining or increasing their revenue this year compared to last year.\n\nSMEs plan growth with ESG measures\n\nThe study also reveals that 58% of SMEs in South Africa are looking ahead with growth in mind, with one in three planning to secure credit to support expansion. As businesses scale, 55% identify increasing their sustainability footprint as a key operational priority for the year.\n\nSMEs in South Africa identify team management and upskilling (92%), effective regulatory support (90%), and implementing sustainable practices and enhancing ESG performance (88%) as the top areas where they require support to drive long-term success.\n\nIn December 2024, Mastercard announced a strategic partnership with SME South Africa, the leading business resource platform for the country. The partnership saw a free workshop aimed at educating SME owners to leverage digital solutions, enhance business resilience and manage a team while fostering their growth and creativity \u2013 directly addressing support areas for SMEs.\n\nMastercard\u2019s commitment to SMEs in South Africa\n\nLast year, Mastercard signed an agreement MTN Group Fintech, aimed to link millions of individuals and small businesses in Africa with digital tools for secure mobile payments, thus enhancing access to the advantages of a digital economy. The company also signed with Johannesburg-based fintech company SAVA to support SMEs through innovative payments technology and infrastructure.\n\nThe Mastercard SME Confidence Index serves as a key benchmark for understanding the evolving landscape of small businesses in South Africa. By working closely with fintech partners, banks, and government agencies, Mastercard continues to provide tailored payment solutions, access to financing, and business education programs that empower SMEs to navigate challenges and seize new opportunities.\n\nFrom driving digital payments adoption and expanding access to credit to fostering financial inclusion and upskilling entrepreneurs, Mastercard remains dedicated to strengthening South Africa\u2019s SME ecosystem and supporting businesses as they adapt to an increasingly digital economy.",

            "content": "Starting on January 7, a series of ferocious wildfires erupted in the Los Angeles area, burning more than 40,000 acres and causing roughly $14.8 billion in damages. Within a month, two teams of specially trained Mastercard employees hit the ground to support the American Red Cross\u2019s relief efforts, serving thousands of people from all walks of life whose homes and businesses had been reduced to smoking rubble.\n\n\u201cWe all have stories to share, and they are what drive us every day,\u201d says Deann Donohue, an O\u2019Fallon, Missouri-based vice president in the company\u2019s Public Sector Center of Excellence who deployed with the first team of volunteers. \u201cIt's providing supplies to the husband whose wife passed the year before who is hoping to find her urn. It\u2019s listening to the fire brigade medic whose parents called him to say news reporters were standing in front of his place as it was burning down.\u201d\n\nMastercard launched its disaster relief corps with the American Red Cross in 2019, with 53 employees trained in all aspects of aid distribution, disaster assessment and shelter operations. Today, Mastercard has 687 employees ready to help, some of whom have deployed multiple times, including to Hurricane Helene in North Carolina last year, Hurricane Ian in Florida in 2022 and the western Kentucky tornadoes in 2021.\n\nIn the deployment\u2019s spare moments, Donohue and Joe Kaczorowski, a senior vice president for Risk Analytics based in Purchase, New York, shared dispatches from their time in Los Angeles.\n\nDay 1: Getting the assignment\n\nIt\u2019s a stark 2 a.m. wake-up for the Purchase-based volunteers, including Kaczorowski, to make the flight out to Los Angeles. A group of 20 volunteers from different offices across the U.S. are doing the same for this first deployment; another dozen employees will fly out next week to relieve them.\n\nUpon arrival, the volunteers join the Red Cross disaster response operation\u2019s stand-up meeting to hear the game plan for the week ahead. \u201cI've already received comments about how they like the energy and collaboration we bring to the mission,\u201d Kaczorowski writes. \u201cSo it's exciting to feel welcomed here.\u201d\n\nAt the hotel, it\u2019s bittersweet to meet new volunteers and see familiar faces from both Red Cross and Mastercard offices. Some of these same volunteers were from the Hurricane Helene response in western North Carolina last fall.\n\n\u201cI remember from my very first deployment resettling Afghan refugees in Texas that a woman told me that people talk about time differently in the Red Cross,\u201d Kaczorowski writes. \u201cIt's not, \u2018How many years have you been involved?\u2019 It's \u2018How many deployments have you done?\u2019 It's really inspiring to see the shift in the concept of time within our own Mastercard team with so many having done multiple deployments now.\u201d\n\nDay 2: On the ground\n\nWith more than four active fires, the recovery work scatters volunteers across the county.\n\nDonohue is stationed at UCLA Research Center close to the Palisades Fire, where FEMA and other organizations are offering services ranging from temporary housing to mental health care to help reprinting Social Security cards and birth certificates.",

            "content": "In a world where consumers are drowning in brand messages, Mastercard is building its brand around something far more valuable than a logo \u2013 passion. Its marketing boss and our president of The Drum Awards for Marketing (Americas) tells us more.\n\nA decade ago, it would have been unthinkable for a brand not to have its logo loudly emblazoned across all sponsorship and partnership activity, be that an F1 race car, a soccer stadium, concert hall, restaurant or any other experiential installation. A recent partnership activity from Mastercard, however, has shown that those days may be at an end. Go for dinner at the Peak with Priceless restaurant in New York\u2019s Hudson Yards and the only tell-tale sign that Mastercard is in partnership with the venue is the subtle red and orange color scheme and \u2018Priceless\u2019 branding.\n\nThrough its Priceless partnership platform, Mastercard is today moving beyond the traditional sponsorship and partnership approach of slapping logos over everything and into a world where curated moments and experiences \u2013 carefully tailored to consumers\u2019 passions \u2013 are forging deeper emotional connections between brands and their audiences.\n\nAt the heart of this evolution at Mastercard is Prateek Sood, the brand\u2019s New York-based vice-president of global marketing and commercial partnerships, who is leading a charge in redefining how Mastercard engages with its consumers. Speaking to The Drum as he takes up the challenge of being president of The Drum Awards for Marketing 2025 (Americas) jury, Sood breaks down how Mastercard is transforming experiential marketing, how AI is reshaping consumer engagement and what he\u2019s looking for in this year\u2019s award entries.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nSood\u2019s career path has been anything but conventional. Originally from India, he grew up in Dubai before moving to the US to study marketing and economics. His early career included a stint in programming during the Y2K era, followed by a move into sales and marketing across the Middle East. After earning an MBA from highly respected Babson College, he joined PepsiCo, where he spent over a decade in various marketing roles before making the leap to Mastercard to further his career experience. Today, Sood leads global partnerships that bring Mastercard\u2019s Priceless strategy to life, connecting consumers with their passions in unforgettable ways.\n\nGone are the days when a simple sponsorship deal meant plastering a brand\u2019s logo across an entire event to get the job done. For Mastercard, partnerships are about creating unique, meaningful and immersive experiences.\n\n\u201cWe take culinary and travel, the two biggest passion points for our card members, and build partnerships that enhance these experiences,\u201d says Sood. \u201cFor example, at Hudson Yards in New York City, we\u2019ve created Priceless experiences that range from exclusive dining at Peak with Priceless to sunrise yoga sessions at The Edge, the highest observation deck in the entire western hemisphere.\u201d\n\nAs Sood outlines, Mastercard\u2019s Priceless strategy is carefully built around delivering experiences across nine consumer passion points: Culinary (which includes exclusive dining experiences, chef-led events and premium restaurant partnerships, such as Peak at Priceless), Travel (which offers access to luxury accommodations, curated trips and unique other travel benefits), Sports (which covers partnerships with Uefa Champions League, the Australian Open and the McLaren F1 team), Arts & Culture (which offers cardholders VIP museum tours, film festival partnerships and theater experiences), Music (which gives access to exclusive concert access, backstage experiences and private performances), Wellness (which includes unique yoga retreats, spa days and wellness programs), Shopping & Fashion (which offers early access to designer collections, personal styling, shopping perks and more), Philanthropy & Social Impact (which includes charitable initiatives, cause-driven partnerships and donation-matching) and Environment (which gives access to card and payment programs that support environmental and conservation schemes).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York entertainment complex Hudson Yards is just one of many examples where Mastercard is bringing its Priceless platform to life. The brand has also gone full throttle into sports partnerships in recent years, creating special experiences at The Open golf championship, the French Open tennis at Roland Garros and the Uefa Champions League football, and it has recently secured a partnership with McLaren\u2019s F1 team, enabling the brand to tap into one of the fastest-growing global sporting fan bases.\n\nThrough these strategic partnerships, Mastercard is turning transactional moments into emotionally resonant brand engagements and in an age where consumers crave authenticity, that distinction is paying dividends for the brand and building loyalty among global consumers.\n\nA fine line between AI & authenticity\n\n\u201cAt Mastercard we are extremely passionate about making sure we are connecting people to their passions,\u201d says Sood. \u201cAI can help us evaluate trends, understand shifting consumer behavior and personalize experiences, but ultimately, for me, marketing is all about emotion. It\u2019s about creating moments that people remember.\u201d\n\nThis balance between automation and authenticity is something marketers must navigate carefully. AI can refine targeting, optimize experiences and even power immersive technologies such as AR and VR, but true brand affinity is built through human-centered storytelling, says Sood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat makes award-winning work?\n\nAs jury president for The Drum Awards for Marketing (Americas), Sood says he will be looking for campaigns that break through the noise with genuine creativity and impact.\n\n\u201cFor me, it is all about creativity. I\u2019m inspired by creativity every day. It\u2019s really the \u2018X\u2019 factor in marketing. Whether something is funny, emotional or deeply insightful, great marketing has to resonate with its audiences. It\u2019s about storytelling; how well can your brand tell a story and make people feel something?\u201d\n\nFor brands vying for a spot on The Drum Awards for Marketing shortlist, Sood\u2019s advice is don\u2019t just follow trends; create something that connects on a human level.\n\nAs marketing continues to evolve and automation threatens to dominate, brands have to rethink how they engage with consumers in a hyper-digital, experience-driven world. Mastercard\u2019s Priceless strategy and range of activity offers an interesting roadmap for how to do this effectively. Rather than simply sponsoring events, the brand is curating unique \u2018moments\u2019 that feel personal, exclusive and are emotionally compelling. The payoff? People reach for their Mastercard when one of their passion points comes calling.\n\n\u201cEvery partnership we take on, we give it 110%,\u201d says Sood. \u201cWe leave no stone unturned in ensuring that our consumers get the best possible experience. And that\u2019s the key to creating something truly priceless.\u201d\n\nFor marketers looking to the future, Sood\u2019s message is clear: logos don\u2019t build loyalty; experiences do. The brands that ultimately succeed will be the ones that go beyond transactions to create meaningful, lasting connections with their audiences.",

Businesses could choose between Mastercard, Visa and eftpos \u2014 with eftpos often the cheapest option.\n\nBut Mastercard allegedly entered into agreements with more than 20 major retailers, from supermarkets to fast food chains and clothing retailers, offering discounted rates for Mastercard credit card transactions if businesses agreed to process all or most of their Mastercard-eftpos debit transactions through the Mastercard network.",

Since taking over as CEO of Berkshire six decades ago, the appropriately named \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d has outperformed the broader market.\n\nAs we approach 2025, some of Berkshire\u2019s assets stand out as promising opportunities, combining excellent fundamentals with acceptable values despite the market\u2019s sustained emphasis on technology and growth stocks.\n\nBerkshire\u2019s CEO is a strong believer in portfolio concentration. Buffett\u2019s investment strategy revolves around choosing companies with significant competitive advantages, effective management teams, and the potential to create regular free cash flow. His concept focuses on buying exceptional firms at acceptable costs rather than inferior enterprises at low rates. This strategy has proven successful across numerous market cycles, with Berkshire Hathaway providing compound yearly returns significantly higher than market averages over several decades.\n\nThe \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d concentrates on companies he understands, avoiding complex technologies or models with uncertain earnings potential. He looks for companies with pricing power, great brand awareness, and the ability to preserve or grow market share even during economic downturns. Buffett\u2019s conservative yet effective approach has helped him become one of history\u2019s most successful investors.\n\nFollowing the filing of Berkshire\u2019s 13F on February 14, we now know that 60% ($180 billion) of Buffett\u2019s $299 billion portfolio is concentrated in just four magnificent stocks.\n\nJapanese stock investors are attentively watching Buffett\u2019s letter in the hopes of gaining information that may affect the country\u2019s trading houses. Buffett has previously approved Japanese trading companies, resulting in increased stock value. Market participants will examine his comments for clues about the future of these companies, particularly as they are impacted by decreasing energy prices and pressure from the US government to reduce oil expenses.\n\nAs usual, Buffett\u2019s shareholder letter is expected to provide significant insights not only into Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s performance but also into market trends.\n\nGrowth Stock Portfolio: 12 Stock Picks By Warren Buffett\n\nA woman using a payment terminal at the checkout of a store showing payment products and solutions.",

            "content": "The UK competition court has approved a controversial settlement that will compensate millions of UK consumers\n\nA \u00a3200 million settlement between Mastercard and former financial ombudsman Walter Merricks has been approved by the Competition Appeal Tribunal.\n\nThe groundbreaking legal action against Mastercard over claims of overcharging on fees was first filed nearly nine years ago. It was billed as the UK\u2019s largest claim of its kind \u2013 and at trial was seeking an estimated payout of \u00a310 billion.\n\nMerricks has won a number of key legal arguments during the course of the trial, which began in 2022. However, Mastercard came out on top on key issues that started to erode the overall value.\n\nIn his statement to the court, Merricks put forward his case for why the settlement is \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 and in the best interests of the people who have been impacted.\n\nMerricks said that significant court rulings in favour of Mastercard had put over 95% of the original value of the claim \u2018at either serious risk or not recoverable.\u2019 When first filed the claimed damages were valued at in excess of \u00a314 billion.\n\nThe \u00a3200 million settlement \u2013 which, alongside compensation payouts, covers all fees, costs and expenses \u2013 has been fiercely criticised for being \u2018too low\u2019 by the funder of the litigation, Innsworth Capital.\n\nBut the court approved of the settlement at a hearing that closed on Friday, signalling that it believes the level agreed is appropriate in the circumstances. A final decision on how the money will be shared out is expected next month.\n\nWalter Merricks, a former chief ombudsman of the Financial Ombudsman Service, told Consumer Voice:\n\n\u2018I am very pleased that the Tribunal has signalled its approval of my \u00a3200 million settlement with Mastercard. \u2018After nearly 9 years of litigation with Mastercard, and despite my funders doing all they could to block the settlement, I expect to be able to deliver meaningful compensation to people who come forward to claim damages. \u2018A final decision on how the \u00a3200 million is to distributed will come in the course of March, and actual distribution should take place later in the year.\u2019\n\nSign up to Consumer Voice to stay updated on how and when to claim.\n\nRow over \u2018very disappointing\u2019 settlement\n\nThe \u00a3200 million settlement was challenged in court by the litigation funder, Innsworth Capital, who is now seeking private out-of-court dispute resolution against Merricks.\n\nInnsworth has said that a settlement that represents less than 2% of the original value of the claim is \u2018very disappointing.\u2019 It is awaiting the final decision from the Tribunal before commenting further.\n\nMerricks has ringfenced a minimum of \u00a345.6 million return to Innsworth to cover costs, fees and disbursements throughout the course of the litigation. This represents a 100% return for the funder.\n\nCompensation available to UK consumers\n\nThe claim is said to have affected up to 44 million UK consumers.\n\nMerricks, in his application to the court, has proposed to distribute the settlement by ringfencing \u00a3100 million for people who come forward to claim.\n\nMerricks has estimated that only 5% (or 2.2 million) people of the 44 million affected would make a claim. On this basis, he is predicting that people would be in line to claim \u00a345, increasing to \u00a370 each if fewer people come forward to claim.\n\nThe remaining \u00a354.4 million will be divided depending on the take-up of compensation \u2013 being shared between consumers if more people claim or with the funder to provide a return on the investment made into the claim.\n\nMerricks has also recommended that unclaimed funds could be paid to an access to justice or consumer charity. He has proposed Good Things Foundation \u2013 a digital inclusion charity \u2013 as his preferred charity.\n\nThe decision about the exact distribution of fees and who is eligible to claim is now in the court\u2019s hands.\n\nAbout the claim against Mastercard\n\nMerricks filed his claim against Mastercard after the European Commission found that Mastercard had unlawfully imposed fees on transactions processed through its network.\n\nThe fees were paid by businesses that accepted Mastercard credit or debit cards from 1992 to 2008. This essentially covered more than half a million businesses in the UK \u2013 including all major supermarkets at the time. Merricks\u2019 lawsuit said these unlawful fees were passed onto consumers in higher retail prices.\n\nThe claim faced a long and complicated journey through the courts \u2013 it was first disallowed by the competition court, a decision which was later overturned by the Court of Appeal. Mastercard then appealed against that decision to the Supreme Court, which upheld Merricks\u2019 claim in December 2020.\n\nThe claim was eventually given the green light to go to trial by the Competition Appeal Tribunal in August 2021.\n\nMastercard agreed to the settlement without any admission of liability.\n\nWhat is litigation funding?\n\nLitigation funding is where a third party covers all the costs of bringing a case to court in return for a share of the win \u2013 that share is only paid out if monies are recovered from the defendant.\n\nLitigation funding agreements (LFAs) are entered into between funders and claimants.These agreements set out the amount that will be paid to the funder should the claim be settled or successful in court. No money is owed to the funder if the claim fails.\n\nFor consumers, litigation funding supports group claims where people come together to make a collective claim against an organisation or business.

Plus, earn an additional 10,000 bonus HawaiianMiles after a purchase is made on an employee card within 90 days of card membership.\n\nWe value Hawaiian Airlines HawaiianMiles at 0.9 cents apiece, making this offer on the Hawaiian Airlines Business card worth about $630. But, with the right redemption, you could get much more value out of those miles.\n\nOther top card benefits include:\n\nOne-time 50% off companion discount\n\n3x miles on eligible Hawaiian Airlines purchases\n\n2x miles on gas, dining, and office supply store purchases\n\n1x miles on all other purchases\n\nThe Hawaiian Airlines Business card comes with a $99 annual fee that is not waived in the first year.\n\nIs This Offer Worth It?\n\nBusiness class on Hawaiian Airlines\u2019 A330.

Plus, you can often find lie-flat Leih\u014dk\u016b Suites from the mainland to Honolulu for as few as 40,000 miles.\n\nAnother reason to consider this offer is the potential merger between Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines. If it goes through, and HawaiianMiles are converted to Alaska miles at a 1:1 ratio, you could have 70,000 Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan miles, which would be worth about $1,120!\n\nWe are big fans of Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan miles because they are very versatile but can be hard to earn. We don\u2019t recommend opening this card purely in the hope of scoring some easy Alaska miles, but it could be a nice surprise if the merger goes through!\n\nHot Tip: Here are the best ways to redeem Hawaiian Airlines miles for maximum value.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Hawaiian Airlines Business card is out with an increased welcome offer of up to 70,000 bonus HawaiianMiles.\n\nWhile Barclays hasn\u2019t said how long this offer will stick around, we can safely assume it will only be valid for a limited time.

The lawsuit, which began in 2016, alleged that Mastercard\u2019s interchange fees led to higher prices for consumers between 1992 and 2008.\n\nThis case is one of the largest collective legal actions in UK history, affecting approximately 46 million people. However, the settlement has sparked debate, particularly over the small individual payouts expected for consumers and the large legal fees claimed by lawyers and litigation funders.\n\nBackground: Why Did Mastercard Face Legal Action?\n\nThe class action was originally filed by Walter Merricks, former UK Financial Ombudsman, on behalf of consumers. The claim accused Mastercard of charging illegally high interchange fees\u2014the fees retailers pay banks when customers use credit or debit cards.\n\nRetailers allegedly passed these costs onto consumers, inflating prices for everyday goods and services. Merricks and his legal team argued that every adult in the UK who used a Mastercard or paid higher prices due to these fees between 1992 and 2008 should receive compensation.\n\nThe case was one of the first major opt-out class action lawsuits allowed under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, making it a landmark legal precedent in the UK.\n\nDetails of the \u00a3200M Settlement\n\nAfter nearly a decade of legal disputes, Mastercard agreed to settle the case for \u00a3200 million in December 2024. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) reviewed the settlement and officially approved it in February 2025.\n\nHere\u2019s how the \u00a3200M will be distributed:\n\nConsumer Payouts: Half of the settlement will go directly to consumers who submit claims, but individual payments are expected to be less than \u00a310 per person .\n\nHalf of the settlement will go directly to consumers who submit claims, but individual payments are expected to be less than . Legal Fees: Lawyers representing the case are set to receive over \u00a318 million .\n\nLawyers representing the case are set to receive over . Litigation Funding Costs: Innsworth Advisors, the firm that financed the lawsuit, will take a significant share of the settlement.\n\nControversy Over Legal Fees and Payouts\n\nWhile the settlement amount seems substantial, it has drawn criticism due to the low compensation for consumers and the large sums going to lawyers and litigation funders.\n\nWho Benefits the Most?\n\nInnsworth Advisors, which funded the case, will receive a large share of the \u00a3200M settlement for their financial backing.\n\nfor their financial backing. Law firms involved in the case will claim \u00a318 million in legal fees .\n\n. The 46 million affected consumers will receive only a small fraction of the total sum, with estimates suggesting payments of \u00a37-\u00a310 per person.\n\nConsumer Rights Groups have argued that the distribution of the settlement raises concerns about the fairness of large-scale class action cases.\n\nMastercard and Legal Representatives Respond\n\nMastercard welcomed the tribunal\u2019s approval of the settlement, stating:\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to have reached a resolution on this long-standing matter and remain committed to ensuring transparency and fairness in our payment systems.\u201d\n\nWalter Merricks, who led the lawsuit, also expressed his satisfaction:\n\n\u201cThis is an important victory for UK consumers. While the individual payments may be small, this case sets a strong precedent for future class action lawsuits in the UK.\u201d\n\nHowever, Seema Kennedy, a representative of the consumer advocacy group Fair Civil Justice, criticized the outcome, saying:\n\n\u201cIt cannot be right that third-party funders and legal teams take the majority of a settlement, leaving consumers with minimal compensation.\u201d\n\nHow to Claim Your Settlement Payout\n\nIf you were affected by Mastercard\u2019s interchange fees between 1992 and 2008, you may be eligible for a payout.\n\nSteps to Claim:\n\nCheck Your Eligibility \u2013 If you were a UK resident during 1992-2008 and used a Mastercard or shopped at businesses accepting Mastercard, you may qualify. Submit a Claim \u2013 The claims process is expected to be launched soon. Keep an eye on the official settlement website (to be announced). Wait for Approval \u2013 Once verified, you will receive your small payout (likely under \u00a310) directly to your bank account.\n\nImplications for Future Class Action Lawsuits\n\nThe Mastercard settlement is a landmark case for UK consumer rights and class action lawsuits. However, it highlights key issues:\n\nEffectiveness of Class Actions \u2013 While collective lawsuits can hold corporations accountable, they often result in small payouts for individuals .\n\n\u2013 While collective lawsuits can hold corporations accountable, they often result in .

Encouraging Corporate Accountability \u2013 Despite the low payouts, this case sets a legal precedent for companies engaging in anti-competitive practices.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe \u00a3200M Mastercard settlement marks a significant moment in UK consumer law, but it also exposes challenges in the legal system regarding fair compensation for affected individuals.\n\nWhile Mastercard and the legal teams involved in the case consider it a successful resolution, many consumers feel the payouts are too small to make a real impact.\n\nFor now, UK residents should stay informed about how to claim their share of the settlement once the official claims process opens.\n\nThis article has been carefully fact-checked by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and eliminate any misleading information.

Both publicly traded companies faced a big blow when an American judge ordered them to pay a hefty $197 million to cardholders. A total of $197 million has been agreed to be paid by Visa and Mastercard to resolve the allegations. In particular, Visa will pay $104.6 million, and Mastercard will pay $92.8 million.\n\nFollowing a previous settlement of $66 million reached by three other banks implicated in the lawsuit Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America this settlement follows suit. Now Visa and Mastercard will have to pay $1,797 Direct Payment for Visa and Mastercard Users. However both companies deny any misconduct or inappropriate practices. Another related class-action lawsuit is pending against companies who own independent ATMs and consumers who used ATMs that are not linked with banks.\n\n$1,797 Direct Payment for Visa and Mastercard Users\n\nVisa and Mastercard are the two largest global payment processors. A recent serious setback for both publicly traded firms occurred when an American judge ordered them to reimburse cardholders $197 million. Based on the facts now available, an American court ordered VISA and Mastercard to repay money seized from their users\u2019 and customers\u2019 cards earlier this year under the guise of higher fees. In its decision, the US court found the extra fees that the two companies were charging their clients illegal.\n\nAccording to news, as part of the settlement, Mastercard will repay $92.8 million to cards, while Visa will pay $104.6 million to customers. When using a Visa or Mastercard to withdraw cash from an ATM in the United States, extra fees are required. According to the court\u2019s ruling, the additional fee was illegal, and Visa and Mastercard were ordered to repay the money.\n\nVisa Mastercard Lawsuit Settlement 2025 Details\n\nCountry America Defaulter company Visa and Mastercard Settlement amount $197 million Claim Deadline February 4, 2025 Category Settlement News Claim website www.paymentcardsettlement.com\n\n$1,797 Direct Payment 2025 Eligibility Requirements\n\nIf you paid a surcharge to get cash from an ATM in America between October 1, 2007 and July 26, 2024, you could be eligible. You are not covered if you returned all of your surcharged ATM purchases or used cards from non-US banks.\n\nWhile the ATM class action settlement administrators should already have your information on file, you may not need to take any additional steps to receive cash from the new settlement if you have already filed a claim and been paid.\n\nIf you paid any additional qualifying ATM fees (as specified in the class action notification) after filing your previous ATM class action claim and were not rewarded for those costs, you may be excused from this rule.\n\nSettlement Amount and other Details\n\nAccording to the settlement documents, Visa will pay $104.6 million and Mastercard will pay $92.8 million. The bank defendants previously resolved lawsuits worth $66 million. The plaintiffs in three cases claimed that Visa and Mastercard\u2019s ATM network restrictions caused them to pay unfairly high access fees. They sought damages totaling more than $9 billion and now they will get the payment as per Visa Mastercard Lawsuit Settlement 2025 Eligibility Requirements\n\nThe decision comes after the United States Supreme Court denied Visa and Mastercard\u2019s appeal, rejecting a lower court judge\u2019s ruling that allowed the plaintiff groups to suit as a class. Consumers will have the opportunity to protest to the conditions of the settlement, including the amount of the fund and any legal expenses granted. Visa and Mastercard are defendants in a long-running federal court case in Brooklyn over allegations that they overcharged retailers and others in debit and credit-card transactions.\n\nClass Action Fund & Distribution\n\nThe settlement money from Visa and Mastercard will be combined into a special Settlement Fund to compensate qualified class members who file legitimate claims. This distribution process is subject to stringent court supervision to ensure that the compensation is distributed fairly among individuals affected by the increased ATM costs.\n\nAs it safeguards the interests of all class members especially those who might not be aware of their eligibility for compensation the court\u2019s stance in this case is crucial. Notably, Visa and Mastercard have denied any responsibility or misconduct in relation to the accusations, despite accepting this huge payment.\n\nSteps to Claim Your Payment before deadline\n\nAccording to available information, VISA charges the card issuer per transaction or by card volume. Mastercard, on the other hand, charges institutions (that issue cards) a percentage of worldwide dollar volume (the total volume of all card transactions performed within a given time period).\n\nBrowse the official class-action settlement webpage www.paymentcardsettlement.com\n\nThen fill Visa Mastercard Lawsuit Settlement 2025 claim form before February 4, 2025.\n\nYou must share your contact details and acknowledge that you paid high ATM fees.\n\nAlthough you may not be required to give proof at first, the claims administrator may seek more documentation to validate your claim.",

The CFR, in account-to-account payments, provides both the sending and the receiving financial institution with intelligence to help detect and prevent scams in real time. Since going live in the UK in 2023, data from the country\u2019s Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) indicated that the value of authorized push payment (APP) scams went down by more than 12 percent.\n\nFeedzai\u2019s platform analyzes digital transactions, integrating device intelligence, network data, and behavioral biometrics to identify suspicious activity to prevent fraud in real time.\n\n\u201cIn the face of [rising scams], financial institutions should consider third party data as an essential part of their strategy for fraud defense,\u201d commented Julie Conroy, chief insights officer, Datos Insights. \u201cBy building on Mastercard\u2019s proven CFR score and extending it globally, this partnership delivers a powerful combination \u2013 Mastercard\u2019s global data expertise and Feedzai\u2019s purpose-built risk scoring capabilities,\u201d she continued.\n\nMastercard already offers behavioral biometrics as part of its Scam Protect service, and joined GASA last year.\n\nSingapore banks add additional verification measure as mobile wallet scams grow\n\nIn response to an increase in scams involving mobile wallets, the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) says major card-issuing banks will adjust their fraud surveillance measures.\n\nPhishing scams involving fraudulent provisioning of debit and credit cards into mobile wallets, such as Apple Pay or Google Pay. The adjustment in fraud surveillance measures have prevented $53.9 million of losses in Q4 2024, the ABS said in a statement, as quoted in The Straits Times.\n\nBy July banks will require additional verification via in-app controls or digital token authentication, to provision cards onto mobile wallets. Banks will also be more proactive in removing their cards from mobile wallets if there are indications of fraudulent activity.\n\nIn these scams, victims are fooled into providing their card details on a phishing website. They are also tricked into giving out their SMS one-time password which the scammers use to authenticate the provisioning of the card onto a mobile wallet on the scammer\u2019s device. Once this has been done the scammer can use the mobile wallet to make unauthorized transactions.\n\nUK PSR supports digital wallets\n\nThe UK\u2019s Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) along with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have engaged the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s (CMA) invitation to comment on its investigations in relation to Apple and Google\u2019s mobile ecosystems.\n\nThey found that in feedback from respondents, digital wallets represent a \u201csignificant opportunity\u201d for consumers. The majority of stakeholders highlighted that wallet users benefit from a \u201cmore seamless and efficient consumer journey.\u201d This included enhanced authentication security measures and greater financial accessibility for underserved or excluded groups.\n\nIn addition, the proportion of card transactions using a digital wallet increased from eight percent in 2019 to 29 percent in 2023, with a higher proportion at in-store terminals.\n\nThe research highlighted the key role that digital wallets \u201care likely to play in future innovation and growth in the UK payments sector\u201d as well as on wider financial services.

Morgan Payments\u2019 ACH capabilities, lets merchants offer customers the ability to pay directly from their bank accounts, the companies said in a news release provided to PYMNTS Friday (Oct. 20).\n\n\u201cWe are dedicated to enabling our clients to offer their customers a variety of payment options,\u201d said Max Neukirchen, head of payments and commerce solutions at J.P. Morgan.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with Mastercard will allow for easy and secure payments directly from bank accounts. We are excited for the future as we have a robust pipeline of biller clients across the U.S. interested to use our Pay-by-bank offering seeking to digitize their processes and increase payments efficiency.\u201d\n\nThe two companies first announced their partnership last year as a way to tap into growing consumer interest in alternative payment methods.\n\nAccording to the release, the tool addresses a variety of biller pain points. For example, access to Mastercard\u2019s Smart Payment Decisioning Tools lets them analyze the best time to initiate the payments based on the bill payer\u2019s transaction behavior and risk patterns, ensuring payments get made and reducing the risks of returns due to insufficient funds.\n\n\u201cFor consumers, pay-by-bank elevates the checkout experience, allowing billers to provide their customers with the option for a new, secure way to pay,\u201d the release adds.\n\nThe tool uses the consumer\u2019s authentication protocols with their bank to access the information needed to make a payment, letting them securely pay for things like rent, utilities, tuition, insurance and healthcare.\n\nThe release notes that Verizon will begin piloting the pay-by-bank tool in the months to come.\n\nPYMNTS examined the rise of pay-by-bank earlier this month in a conversation with Link Money CEO Eric Shoykhet.\n\nHe argued that, for the moment, open banking will be \u201coffering-driven,\u201d because \u201cconsumers in a lot of cases don\u2019t understand \u2014 or even know \u2014 about the solutions that either they\u2019re looking for or that some of these things are possible.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he added, \u201cit\u2019s going to be up to the key infrastructure providers and people in the value chain to push open banking-related use cases and products.\u201d\n\nAs that report notes, pay-by-bank is increasingly being increasingly embraced in the U.S. Merchants are promoting pay-by-bank because they have a strong incentive to reduce their payment processing costs by as much as 70% or 80%, said Shoyet.\n\nConsumers, meanwhile, are facing macroeconomic factors that drive them to open banking, with high interest rates on credit cards leading them to shift to debit transactions and pay-by-bank checkout offerings.",

            "content": "Gabby Jones/Bloomberg\n\nMastercard is selling a digital version of an \"all in one\" payment rail, hoping to attract young consumers who want to centralize their expenses and transactions.\n\nThe card network's One Credential, which it launched this week, joins firms such as Visa, Apple and Curve that also power a single portal to a menu of payment choices, rather than managing separate credentials for each option. \"You've had credit, debit and prepaid in different accounts. But today you can get all of those payments in one way,\" Bunita Sawhney, Mastercard's chief consumer product officer, told American Banker.\n\nMastercard and its competitors are trying to capture younger consumers who have different shopping, budgeting and spending habits than older generations. Citing internal research, Mastercard said 65% of Gen Z consumers want to manage all their payment accounts in one place online. Mastercard also reported that Gen Z consumers find payment personalization three times more important than other generations.\n\nMastercard and Visa protect these transactions through tokenization, which replaces card numbers with a one-time code that's unusable if stolen. The mobile wallet providers use the embedded security function on their smartphones.\n\n\"Apple, [Samsung and Google] are also trying to own this space,\" said Tony DeSanctis, a senior director at Cornerstone Advisors, noting that Apple, Google and Samsung's digital wallets have global consumer and merchant networks that have similar size as the card networks. \"It certainly makes competition more difficult. More than payments, this is about scale.\"\n\nResearch from Arizent , American Banker's publisher, found that offering different alternatives that are easily accessible at the point of sale is causing younger consumers to drift away from legacy banks and card issuers to fintechs. Sixty-six percent of millennials, for example, report being likely to use buy now/pay later at the point of sale, compared with only 31% of boomers.\n\n\"These are consumers that grew up in a digital environment. They want a 'remote control' for their financial lives,\" Mastercard's Sawhney said. For example, a consumer can use One Credential to route expenses under $100, such as groceries or fuel, from their debit card, use a credit card for expenses over $100; and installments for larger purchases. These preferences are managed online or in an app, with the consumer controlling how the transactions are funded.\n\nMastercard clients that have enabled their payment technology to support One Credential include Australia's Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, a holding company that owns Bendigo Bank and the digital bank UP. Other participants are Episode Six, a firm that sells enterprise-grade payment processing and ledger infrastructure; Galileo Financial Technologies; i2c Inc., a provider of banking and payments technology; and Lithic, a financial technology platform. Marqeta, a card-issuing platform, is also part of One Credential's network.\n\n\"Innovations like Mastercard One Credential signal a shift toward more dynamic, consumer-driven payments, and issuers that prepare early will be best positioned to meet evolving expectations,\" said Amir Wain, CEO and Founder of i2c, in an email. \"The key is ensuring payment infrastructure is ready before these capabilities become the industry standard.\"\n\nOther options in the \"all in one\" payments market include Visa's Flexible Credential, which enables banks to issue a single card that toggles between payment methods. Consumers use Visa Credential to choose to pay via credit or debit, assign payments to a virtual card with customized controls, finance over installments or pay with incentive marketing points.\n\nIn an earlier interview, Mark Nelsen, Visa's head of product for consumer payments, told American Banker , \"It's a new way of looking at the card, so consumers don't have to sort through multiple different 16-digit accounts when they decide how to pay.\"\n\nSamsung and Curve, a fintech that offers an \"all in one card\" that enables consumers to switch payment cards at the point of sale, are co-developing a mobile wallet to compete with wallets from Apple and Google. The Samsung/Curve wallet project followed Apple's agreement with European Union regulators to open technology that supports mobile payments. Apple's move created an opportunity for competitors while also pushing Apple to offer more flexible payment options to consumers.\n\nThe concept is not old. All-in-one card products have been tried multiple times for more than a decade and really haven't found a footing because they've always been clunky, according to David Shipper, strategic advisor for retail banking and payments for Datos Insights, adding that One Credential and Flexible Credentials should offer a more seamless process for the consumer.\n\n\"Card issuers can benefit from this feature, so there is no doubt we'll see a lot of interest from banks and credit unions,\" Shipper said. \"Rather than moving between a debit card at their bank for small purchases to a credit card issued by AMEX for online purchases or a BNPL product offered by another company for large purchases, cardholders will be more likely to keep all payments with a single financial institution or the convenience and control provided through this feature.\"\n\nDatos Insights research shows that consumers are already choosing debit, credit, prepaid and BNPL based on the transaction type and amount, Shipper said. \"While implementations will vary by the card issuer, allowing the consumer to predefine which payment type to use based on the purchase type or making it simple to switch between payment types will simplify these decisions.\"",

However, among these businesses, there is an understanding that transitioning to cashless transactions can lead to reduced fraud risk, quicker revenue access, and enhanced credibility with governmental bodies and financial institutions. The primary barriers to this transition are a lack of education and confidence in digital payment systems.\n\n\u201cSmall and medium enterprises are the backbone of economies, driving innovation, employment, and resilience. As digital transformation accelerates, SMEs are unlocking new opportunities through digital payments and financial inclusion. Their ability to adapt and grow in a rapidly evolving business landscape reflects the strength of an ecosystem that prioritizes access to finance, digital enablement, and sustainable growth,\u201d said Dimitrios Dosis, president Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, Mastercard.\n\n\u201cMoroccan SMEs recognize the benefits of digital transformation, and Mastercard is here to support them with the right tools, technology, and expertise. By fostering financial inclusion and simplifying access to digital payments, we aim to help businesses build resilience and scale sustainably,\u201d said Mark Elliott, division president, Africa, Mastercard.\n\nEconomic challenges and resilience\n\nDespite facing challenges such as rising costs of goods and services, inflation, and unemployment, 67% of Moroccan SMEs anticipate maintaining or increasing their revenue compared to the previous year. Factors contributing to this optimism include growing export opportunities and an expanding domestic market.\n\nIdentifying growth opportunities and priorities\n\nLooking ahead, Moroccan SMEs see government-led initiatives as the most impactful factor in driving business growth, with many also recognizing the value of international collaborations and private sector partnerships. As businesses continue to explore digital opportunities, e-commerce is gaining traction, with a growing number of SMEs seeing it as a means to expand their reach and streamline operations.\n\nBeyond digital payments, Moroccan SMEs are also prioritizing upskilling and workforce development as key enablers of business growth. Many business owners highlight access to training and development programs, staff upskilling, and seamless payment solutions as essential to improving their operations. However, finding specialized talent and navigating regulatory frameworks remain pressing concerns that businesses must address to fully capitalize on digital opportunities.\n\nCommitment to Moroccan SMEs\n\nMastercard is actively supporting Morocco\u2019s digital transformation through strategic partnerships and financial literacy initiatives. In collaboration with Bank of Africa, Mastercard is expanding access to innovative, secure payment solutions, accelerating the transition towards a more inclusive digital economy. This partnership is helping SMEs integrate modern payment technologies, enhance financial services, and streamline their business operations.\n\nTo further drive financial inclusion, Mastercard Academy has launched an online financial literacy course, equipping SMEs with essential knowledge on electronic payments, budgeting, credit management, and financial security. By increasing access to financial education, Mastercard is empowering Moroccan entrepreneurs with the tools they need to confidently adopt digital solutions, grow their businesses, and navigate an evolving financial landscape.\n\nThrough these efforts, Mastercard reaffirms its commitment to fostering a resilient and inclusive digital economy in Morocco, ensuring that SMEs have the resources and support they need to thrive in an increasingly digital world.",

            "content": "Mastercard Inc. unfairly reduced a \u00a310 billion ($12.6 billion) class action case to a settlement of just \u00a3200 million, according to the firm that funded the lawsuit.\n\nThe credit-card company \u201cskillfully maneuvered\u201d claimant Walter Merricks and his lawyers by offering an inferior settlement to end the case, according to the litigation funder Innsworth Advisors Ltd. The lawsuit alleged Mastercard charged consumers and businesses too much to use its cards.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that Innsworth\u2019s submissions make poorly aimed pot-shots at the negotiation process, they are hopeless,\u201d lawyers for Mastercard countered. \u201cInnsworth\u2019s interests lie in maximizing its commercial recovery even if that entails a high-risk gamble,\u201d they said arguing the settlement is fair and reasonable.\n\nThe legal drama follows the settlement in what was once the country\u2019s largest class action claim over the amount Mastercard charged consumers and businesses to use its cards. Merricks\u2019 lawyers have since acknowledged that \u201cthere was an overclaim\u201d in his suit.\n\nThe case highlights the tension facing courts in cases meant to maximize returns for consumers at a time when litigation funders are betting on a rise in class actions in the UK. The outcome of the case will likely set a precedent for how judges balance fair compensation and returns for those who foot the legal bill.\n\n\u201cThe potential settlement raises significant policy questions,\u201d Innsworth\u2019s spokesperson said. The intervention is aimed at getting clarity on the UK\u2019s class action regime for future cases and to ensure scrutiny of the proposed settlement, she said.\n\n\u201cIt is notable that none of the over 44 million class members have objected,\u201d Mastercard\u2019s lawyers said in their document. The company declined to comment beyond the legal filing.\n\nThe \u00a3200 million settlement is a \u201cvery significant sum\u201d out of which half is to be paid to consumers, according to lawyers for Merricks.\n\nThe funder incurred legal bills worth around \u00a345 million and would double the investment in six years if it gets the remaining \u00a3100 million, lawyers for Merricks said. \u201cMr. Merricks cannot accept that 89.5% of the settlement sum be paid to the funder as this would not be in the best interests of the class,\u201d his lawyers said.\n\nMerricks obtained a \u00a310 million indemnity from Mastercard to cover his expenses to contest a legal case against him started by Innsworth, according to the documents.\n\nA spokesperson for Merricks declined to comment.\n\nMastercard and its rival Visa Inc. have for years been the focus of civil complaints over the amount they charge consumers and businesses to use their cards. The case stems from an EU ruling that the interchange card fees the company levied for transactions were unfair and breached competition law.\n\nPhotograph: Mastercard Inc. signage.

            "content": "Mastercard Inc. announced early Wednesday the launch of One Credential, a digital-payment solution that supports multiple payment methods such as credit, debit, and prepaid, as well as installment loans, on a single card.\n\nTargeted primarily at Gen Zers, One Credential allows consumers to tailor their payment methods to better manage their personal finances. For example, a One Credential user can opt to pay for household expenses using her checking account, and pay for larger purchases using an installment loan. Users can also set dollar-amount limits that trigger the account that will be used to pay for a purchase, such as any purchase over $100 automatically being charged to the user\u2019s credit card. Users can set their preferences online or through the One Credential app, which also provides an overview of users\u2019 spending.\n\n\u201cMastercard One Credential empowers cardholders with more choice and convenience in how they pay,\u201d a Mastercard spokesperson says by email. \u201cInstallments is one of those choices that is especially appealing to cardholders who are dipping their toes into credit, finding a path to creditworthiness, and want increased transparency and control over their finances. By introducing structured credit, cardholders can manage and control their finances based on their needs.\u201d\n\nMastercard says it is targeting Gen Zers because of their preference for \u201cinnovative\u201d digital tools that help them manage their finances.\n\nResearch by Mastercard reveals that nearly half of Gen Zers prefer to use new and innovative methods of payment, while 65% want to manage all their finances through a single app. In addition, the research indicates Gen Zers prefer personalized solutions. Personalization is 1.31 times more important to Gen Zers than to other generations when choosing a payment method, Mastercard says.\n\n\u201cDatos Insights consumer research shows a clear preference for debit vs. credit based on the purchase type and amount across all age groups. This could be especially attractive to Gen Zers wanting the most efficient way to manage their spending rather than fumbling through their wallet searching for the right card for each purchase,\u201d David Shipper, a strategic advisor for Datos Insights, says by email.\n\nOn the issuing side, Mastercard is partnering with card-issuing platform providers Marqueta Inc., Galileo Financial Technologies LLC, and Lithic Inc. Other technology partners include i2c Inc., a provider of banking and payments technology, and payment processor Episode Six Inc.\n\nWio Bank, a digital banking platform, has launched One Credential in the United Arab Emirates. Australia\u2019s Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Group and UP, a neobank in Australia, will also issue One Credential.\n\nOn the issuing side, One Credential will provide issuers with a point of differentiation for younger consumers, Mastercard says. Plans are also in the works to roll out One Credential for small businesses.\n\n\u201cOne Credential offers issuers an option to deliver a differentiated experience that is especially appealing to digitally native cardholders who want choice and control over how they pay,\u201d the Mastercard spokesperson says. \u201cIt also enables issuers to offer consumers multiple products in a single, programmable journey, which contributes to top-of-wallet behavior.\u201d\n\nOne Credential is similar to Visa Inc.\u2019s Flexible credential, which allows cardholders to choose from a list of payment methods when using a Visa card, including debit, credit, or buy now pay later, through a single credential. Flexible Credential users can also choose to pay via rewards points. Introduced in May 2024, Flexible Credential launched in Japan and was introduced in the United States in July.\n\nWhile One Credential and Visa Flexible Credential both appear to provide similar user experiences, a consumer\u2019s choice between the two \u201cwill depend on whether the issuer is a Mastercard or Visa card issuer, and not because one is better than the other,\u201d Shipper adds.",

            "content": "Pettit: I dropped out of three college programs before the age of 21. I just wasn't having a lot of success with traditional schooling. The whole trajectory of going to school, getting a corporate job and then working to buy a house - it wasn't for me. So, I decided that when I turned 18, I would drop out and get a job working at LensCrafters and Pearle Vision in the mentor department. It was the first time I was able to learn a skill and put it into practice. I was amazing at it. Within a few weeks, I was one of the best salespeople at that store. At 18, not knowing what I was doing with my life, working in retail was such a blessing. It gave me confidence and made me realize that I do have a lot of knowledge to offer - just not in traditional ways.\n\nWhat was your journey as an entrepreneur, and how did you develop the skills that led you to start your business?\n\nAaniin, which means \"hello\" in Ojibwe, quickly grew into a successful venture. In 2022, Pettit was recognized as one of the inaugural recipients of the Mastercard x Pier Five Small Business Fund , helping to propel Aaniin's growth. Today, Aaniin is a true reflection of Pettit's vision for inclusivity, community and collaboration. The Mastercard Newsroom sat down with Pettit to learn more about her entrepreneurial journey, the lessons she's learned and what's next for Aaniin.\n\nBut this disappointment quickly turned to inspiration. \"That's when I decided to create something real,\" she recalls, leading her to launch Aaniin, a brand that tells stories and connects wearers to Indigenous culture through meaningful design via QR codes on the apparel.\n\nPettit's entrepreneurial journey didn't begin with a clear path or a traditional business plan. It wasn't until she saw a man wearing a T-shirt with an Indigenous symbol that she felt an immediate sense of connection. Excited to learn more, Pettit, who is Anishinaabe and a member of Aamjiwnaang First Nation, approached him - only to discover the symbol was not Indigenous at all, but simply a triangle.\n\nPettit, founder of the Indigenous clothing brand Aaniin , was mopping the floors of her 6,500-square-foot pop-up at Toronto's Eaton Centre - supported by Mastercard, it was billed as the first 100% Indigenous-owned department store in Canada - while her team rang up tens of thousands of dollars in sales. \"Holy cow, this is actually working,\" she recalled thinking at the time. \"It was working because I was letting my team do what they needed to, making money in the space.\"\n\nAs Chelsee Pettit kneeled on the floor, a bottle of Windex in one hand, a fistful of paper towels in the other, she knew one thing for certain: She had made it.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThree years later, I had another business idea called Intuition Business Solutions. I wanted to create a space for Indigenous representation in business consulting, not just for Indigenous businesses but for small businesses in general. I'd offer services like marketing or website redesigns for free to coffee shops, which I knew couldn't afford them. I was still working as a store manager, so I filled my extra hours with learning new skills, like business registration. I designed logos, built websites and helped small business owners who didn't know how to navigate these tasks.\n\nThe vision for that business idea ultimately led me to what Aaniin is today. I wanted to create an inclusive workplace where people could learn valuable skills without needing a formal education. My goal was to build an ecosystem where businesses could collaborate and support each other.\n\nAs an Indigenous female entrepreneur, what are some of the challenges you face in the business world, and how have you navigated them?\n\nPettit: As Indigenous people, we face many barriers - cultural appropriation, access to capital and the assumption that we should donate all our profits because we're seen as part of a communal, socialist economy. People often think that I donate all proceeds to Indigenous charities, which is crazy. We're a for-profit business trying to impact the Indigenous economy, and we can't do that if we donate all of our profits.\n\nI also knew people would place higher expectations on me as an Indigenous business owner. With manufacturing, I started this business with a $300 credit card bill. I didn't have thousands of dollars to launch a clothing brand or hire a graphic designer. I spent every minute of my time trying to grow the brand for free because I didn't have resources.\n\nI think many people severely overestimate what it takes to start an Indigenous business. They don't understand how small businesses are built in general, and they expect us to operate at a much higher standard. For example, people think we should be weaving fabrics in our backyards. I've had many people at markets ask if I made the T-shirts myself. I tell them, \u2018No, it's a T-shirt. There are suppliers and manufacturers for a reason - they've figured out how to do it. I don't need to reinvent the wheel.'\n\nHow did you approach making your brand more accessible and inclusive for a wider audience?\n\nPettit: When I announced that I was starting my business, my mom, who's Belgian and Dutch, immediately asked, \u2018Can I wear this T-shirt?' I told her, of course, it's just a T-shirt, not regalia. She asked, \u2018What if I don't know how to pronounce it or remember what it says?' I said, \u2018Indigenous people who don't speak the language won't know how to pronounce it either, or what it says.'\n\nThat's when I decided to bridge the educational gap. I wanted to take the pressure off the wearer, so they wouldn't feel stressed about being asked what the T-shirt says. I added QR codes to all of our garments and accessories. Each design links to our translation page, where customers can see the meaning behind the designs.\n\nYou were an inaugural recipient of the Mastercard x Pier Five Small Business Fund in 2022. What motivated you to apply and how did it impact Aaniin's success?\n\nPettit: At that time, I didn't know where to start, had no money and was selling garments every day after work. I'd go out to market on weekends and sell the whole time. It was like that for about two and a half months, and I made $15,000, which was great, but there was no profit because I didn't have proper manufacturing processes and was doing everything for free. The garments were expensive, too.\n\nReceiving that grant was a huge boost for the business. I remember filling out the application - it was a personal experience. They weren't asking typical grant questions like, \"What will you do with the money?\" or \"What's your secret sauce?\" Mastercard really wanted to understand what was going on with the business. The questions felt personalized, and it seemed like they genuinely cared about the businesses, our personalities and our missions \u2026 It was the first time I was really able to step back and think big picture. As a business owner, you're always focused on the now, so it was nice to reflect on the future.\n\nYou just finished up your four-week pop-up at the Eaton Centre in Toronto. How does it feel to break new ground in such a significant way?\n\nPettit: At the pop-up, nothing has changed from when I started four years ago. I was still doing everything alone, reaching out to the Eaton Centre with no money. It was a scary thing to do, but delusion was the only thing that gave me the confidence to keep moving forward. As an entrepreneur, you just get better at utilizing resources and finding faster and bigger ways to do things.\n\nZooming out a bit, what role do you believe small businesses play in shaping communities and driving economic growth in general?\n\nPettit: A huge role. Take, for example, the fact that we saw almost every single customer we ever had come back to our pop-up in the Eaton Centre. People are looking for community. People enjoyed the staff smiling, engaging with them and sharing stories about all the businesses. Our staff was called storytellers, not sales associates, because we weren't just selling products. We were sharing the meaning and purpose behind the Indigenous brands in the store. I love focusing on product knowledge and storytelling - it's one of my best skills.\n\nThis was one of the biggest things to prove that people want in-store experiences. They don't want cookie-cutter retail or big-box store displays. We added personal touches to everything - merchandising, marketing and every product in the store had personality behind it. That's something I think is severely lacking in other retailers in the mall.\n\nLooking to the future, what are your goals for Aaniin? How do you plan to grow your brand and continue to impact the Indigenous business landscape?\n\nPettit: For the first time, I'm able to invest in others more than I invest in myself. Investing in my employees is massive. I've been doing this alone for four years, so this is the first year I have a small team to support me. Looking ahead, we might be able to do three pop-ups next holiday season, or the one after that. I'm not focused on hard timelines; I want to prioritize the quality of what we execute moving forward.\n\nOriginally published by Mastercard\n\nFollow along Mastercard's journey to connect and power an inclusive, digital economy that benefits everyone, everywhere.\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Mastercard on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\n\nSpokesperson: Mastercard\n\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/mastercard\n\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: Mastercard\n\n\n\n\n\nView the original press release on ACCESS Newswire\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "In the latest Mastercard Signals published titled \u201cRacing Toward the Future of Payments,\u201d the 2025 first-quarter report looks at how the payments industry continues to evolve. New technology, consumer and business heightened expectations and the expansions of new systems will continue to shape the payments ecosystem by 2030. Mastercard said these various trends aren\u2019t isolated but should be seen as an interconnected \u201croadmap\u201d for the evolution of payments in the next five years.\n\nThe first trend sees payments becoming globally interoperable; the system as a whole is fragmented with platforms operating independently, especially with cross-border and cross-platform transactions.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nThe report\u2019s authors predict by 2030, shared global standards and technological innovation will create a world where payments flow across platforms, currencies and borders to create secure, invisible transactions \u2014 where consumers and businesses can make transactions across borders, currencies and platforms.\n\nAnother notable trend is how payment wallets will evolve to become a digital command center. Artificial intelligence-driven personalization and integration with identity and financial management tools to transform wallets into the major hub for daily life.\n\nBetween 2025 and 2030, digital wallets are set to evolve into becoming more intelligent and proactive assistants capable of managing consumers\u2019 finances, travel, health records, subscriptions and more \u2014 merging the worlds of the physical and the digital together.\n\nNotably, millions of small businesses lack the ability to accept digital payments and inconvenient checkout friction is the leading cause of e-commerce cart abandonment. This expanding technology to allow more payment acceptance and make quicker checkout is beneficial for both merchants and consumers, in-person and online.\n\nNow more than ever, businesses are turning to e-commerce digital platforms to establish their virtual store front \u2014 Shopify saw 5 percent growth in 2024, Squarespace had a 7 percent increase and 13 percent growth at Wix.\n\nLeading technologies from \u201cTap From Phone\u201d with contactless cards or digital wallets, \u201cClick to Pay\u201d and passkeys to artificial intelligence-powered checkouts are helping to democratize payment acceptance to power a more personalized and \u201cno-checkout experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see democratization of acceptance across three planes: more merchants entering the ecosystem, more types of payments accepted and an increase in the number of technology partners involved,\u201d said Jennifer Marriner, executive vice president of global acceptance solutions at Mastercard. \u201cThis will create a more inclusive and innovative commercial environment and a better experience for consumers.\u201d\n\nWhile payment partnerships typically occur between banks and fintech, Mastercard envisions the incorporation of a variety of players getting involved to create a more inclusive and interconnected commerce space.\n\nOthers who are getting involved include internet service providers, governments and their agencies, crypto companies, social media platforms, telecoms and other innovators. Already governments of the U.K., Argentina, Europe and Chile have allowed fintech companies to offer payment services to businesses without requiring a banking license.\n\nThe report proposes that the creation of collaborative ecosystems will be a major driver in the creation of integrating embedded finance and enabling lower-friction, inclusive and cross-platform solutions for both businesses and consumers.\n\n\u201cThe challenges ahead are as significant as they are exciting,\u201d said Ken Moore, chief innovation officer of Mastercard. \u201cSuccess belongs to those who not only have a keen eye on the road ahead, but also the agility to adapt to a fast-changing environment. It\u2019s a team endeavor more than ever before. By embracing innovation, navigating complexities and prioritizing inclusivity, we can accelerate toward a future where payments drive global prosperity.\u201d",

In the U.S., that means teaming with providers like Citizens to bring the card to their middle-market customers, and with FinTech providers offering tools for the segment\u2019s most critical needs.\n\n\u201cAs trusted advisers to our clients, we know firsthand that the middle market has a set of unique characteristics and pain points that require tailor-made solutions to fit their needs,\u201d said Rodrigo Sanchez, head of commercial card solutions at Citizens. \u201cThis presents a major opportunity for collaboration to meet them where they are and help advance the growth of this important sector.\u201d\n\nAmong the accelerator\u2019s solutions are a new Mastercard business card designed for the middle market, a cash flow management offering through Trovata, an expense management service via Navan, and Mastercard security measures such as identity theft protection.\n\nThe launch comes as middle-market companies are placing more weight on tailored financial solutions, the release added, pointing to in-house research showing that 40% of these firms would switch providers if offered products with a better fit.\n\nAnd as PYMNTS wrote last year, the financial world has only begun to recognize the opportunity middle-market companies offer.\n\n\u201cThe large banks and the card networks, they are waking up to the fact that the middle market is a massive market \u2014 and one that\u2019s not particularly well-served by the finance industry with real pain points to solve,\u201d Paul Christensen, founder and chief executive of Previse, told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster.\n\nPart of the problem is that middle-market businesses are often too large for small business solutions, yet too small for enterprise-level capabilities. Unfortunately, Christensen said, the conversation surrounding middle-market companies remains centered around buzzwords and high-level aspirations, and not concrete solutions.\n\n\u201cThe conversations we\u2019re seeing [around the middle market] are more a recognition of the opportunity, and it is a massive opportunity, but it will take time to translate that recognition into delivering services that meet their needs,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Today, Mastercard announced Mastercard Mid-Market Accelerator, its latest suite of small and medium-sized (SME) solutions designed for financial providers to meet the unique needs of their middle market customers. The new offering will be available in the U.S. initially, with plans to scale globally. It combines Mastercard\u2019s digital payments technology and several of its value-added services with enhanced features from leading partners that provide transparency, automation, and security.\n\nThere is an untapped opportunity to support the growth and digitization of middle market companies, specifically the lower-middle market, which is broadly defined as companies with annual revenues between $10M and $100M, or with roughly 50-250 employees. New insights from Mastercard research revealed that fewer than 10 percent of financial providers offered services that support holistic financial visibility \u2013 exposing a significant capability gap for the segment. In parallel, middle market companies are placing increasing importance on tailored solutions, so much so that other Mastercard research showed four out of 10 would switch providers if offered products with a better fit.\n\n\u201cMastercard Mid-Market Accelerator reinforces our commitment to powering commerce for businesses of all sizes and supporting companies along every stage of their growth journey,\u201d said Jane Prokop, executive vice president and global head of small and medium enterprises at Mastercard. \u201cWith the launch of these dedicated solutions, Mastercard aims to address the longstanding barriers that have blocked midsize companies from accessing bespoke tools fit for their sophisticated needs.\u201d\n\nIntroducing a new solution suite to empower the middle market\n\nMastercard Mid-Market Accelerator provides a flexible, robust blend of solutions that financial providers can custom-select to meet middle market customers wherever they are in their journeys.\n\nNew Mastercard business card tailored for the middle market offers a curated set of select Mastercard card benefits from existing small business and commercial card programs, plus new rewards designed for the segment. The card is available in both physical and virtual card options, providing midsize companies with more flexibility, choice and spending control with every transaction.\n\nCash Flow Management (via Trovata): securely automates the aggregation and categorization of data across multiple banks, enabling finance and treasury teams to analyze cash flow trends, forecast liquidity and make smarter, data-driven decisions in near real-time. Trovata is further expanding its payments capabilities by integrating with Mastercard\u2019s virtual card platform, which will make supplier payments more efficient and secure for midsize companies.\n\nExpense Management (via Navan): powers improved expense management with embedded virtual cards that bring robust spend controls to drive policy compliance and offer transaction-level insights to automate reconciliation and provide real-time spend visibility.\n\nEnhanced Security: The benefits of the Mastercard network include ID Theft Protection\u2122, HealthLock, Zero Liability Protection and more, as well as the enhanced control and security of virtual cards. Scaling with partners\n\nThe company is innovating with top players from across the ecosystem to support midsize businesses in the U.S., its first target market. Mastercard will collaborate with innovative providers like Citizens to bring the card to their middle market customers, and with key fintech providers to deliver select tools fit for the segment\u2019s most critical needs.\n\n\u201cAs trusted advisers to our clients, we know firsthand that the middle market has a set of unique characteristics and pain points that require tailor-made solutions to fit their needs,\u201d said Rodrigo Sanchez, head of commercial card solutions at Citizens. \u201cThis presents a major opportunity for collaboration to meet them where they are and help advance the growth of this important sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistorically, processes like expense management can be manual and time-consuming, which is especially draining for middle market companies with leaner teams and resources,\u201d said Michael Sindicich, CEO of Navan Expense. \u201cAdding Navan\u2019s expense management capabilities into Mastercard\u2019s new solution suite can be a game-changer, enabling businesses to focus on what matters \u2014 growing and scaling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re modernizing finance and treasury by democratizing bank data and automating cash workflows,\u201d said Brett Turner, Founder and CEO, Trovata. \u201cAs a tech platform for business\u2019 \u2018trove of financial data,\u2019 Trovata does the heavy lifting so that organizations, including those that sit within the middle market, can focus on the strategic aspects of their business. We aggregate, transform, and store their bank data as a managed service to power next-level business intelligence, payments, and working capital optimization in near real-time.\u201d",

            "content": "Most entrepreneurs dream of tapping into the kind of capital, industry connections and sophisticated software that Martin Naor has at his fingertips.\n\nThe Uruguayan entrepreneur has certainly benefitted from a full career that took him from managing products and businesses for Microsoft to sitting on company boards, investing in startups and running the Montevideo-based tech firm Infocorp.\n\nYet launching a new business is always a twisty road, and Naor had his share of unforeseen curves when he started his fintech Bankingly a decade ago.\n\nBankingly was born from a flash insight. Naor noticed that while major banks were proactively building tech solutions to drive their digital transformation, smaller institutions were struggling to migrate online.\n\nHe also understood how transformative digital banking could be for people living Latin America, where one in five adults are still unbanked and many of those who are still spend hours travelling to their bank branch.\n\nSo he created a venture to provide smaller banks and credit unions from Argentina to Mexico \u2014 and more recently, Kenya and Nigeria \u2014 with the software they need to offer digital banking services.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to sell to the big boys,\u201d says Naor, 53. \u201cWe decided the big blue ocean of opportunity was on small and medium-sized financial institutions in emerging markets.\u201d\n\nRather than start from scratch, he launched Bankingly as a Infocorp spin-off so he could piggyback off the company\u2019s products and experiences and reach the market quickly with a segment-friendly offering of low start-up costs and per-usage charges.\n\nWhat he did not foresee was the hesitancy. Back in 2015, many of the smaller banks Naor approached saw little reason to start offering online banking to their customers. They preferred relying solely on tried-and-tested traditional branch banking.\n\n\u201cThey were less anxious to digitalize than we expected. My na\u00efve starting point was that if I put an affordable, scalable solution in front of them, they\u2019ll jump at it,\u201d he admits.\n\nHe quickly realized he needed to tweak Bankingly\u2019s business model and spend its capital wisely so he could take the time to show banks and credit unions the benefits of digitalization, plus convince regulators its cloud-based systems were secure.\n\nDespite the slow start, financial institutions who started using Bankingly\u2019s apps and platforms soon saw their customers were more likely to deposit their salaries, build up savings and increase their card transactions.\n\nTen years down the road, Bankingly has 120 clients in 20 countries who use its cloud-based solutions to provide some 4 million customers with digital services from onboarding to payment transactions and loan applications.\n\nMore importantly, by giving millions of people across Latin America and in Africa access to accounts from their smartphones, Bankingly is playing a role in significantly helping boost financial inclusion in the region. A 2023 Mastercard survey on financial inclusion in Latin America showed that 79% of adults had a bank account in 2023, as opposed to 52% in a report from 2014.\n\nBut just 40% of people outside of major cities and 59% of people from low-income households held bank accounts, according to the same study, so more still needs to be done to broaden access to those who have traditionally been excluded.\n\nFor Bankingly, joining Mastercard Start Path, the company\u2019s award-winning startup engagement program, in October will help speed up emerging market digitalization and offers a chance to potentially acquire new clients who can reach those unbanked people, including the ability to offer credit cards to their customers for the first time.\n\nMotivated by the opportunity to open up financial services for more underserved communities and small businesses, Naor hopes Bankingly\u2019s growth will mean more than 5 million people are using its software within two years.\n\nAs he firmly believes, \u201cDigital financial services can really change lives.\u201d",

The partnership also will expedite the deployment of Mastercard\u2019s Consumer Fraud Risk service.\n\nIn account-to-account payments, the Consumer Fraud Risk service will help both sending and receiving financial institutions with data to help detect and prevent scams in real time, Mastercard says.\n\nThe Feedzai platform can analyze every digital transaction, from card purchases to real-time transfers, for multiple risk indicators in real time, Mastercard says. With the integration of information about the device being used, network data, and behavioral biometrics, Feedzai can identify suspicious activity as it\u2019s happening, Mastercard says, and potentially stop the fraud before funds are lost.",

It allows users to send funds using familiar identifiers like email addresses rather than complex wallet addresses while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The system also helps prevent misdirected transactions by verifying whether a recipient\u2019s wallet can receive a specific asset.\n\n\u201cWhat is stopping [crypto] from going mainstream is really that consumers need to be able to find each other using what they already know,\u201d Dhamodharan said.\n\nMastercard\u2019s goal, according to Dhamodharan, is to be a connector between traditional finance and blockchain networks, ensuring regulatory compliance while enabling new business models. The company plans to announce additional partnerships and use cases in 2025, reinforcing its commitment to integrating crypto into global payments.\n\n\u201cAs an industry as a whole, we need to be very open to making [crypto] available as broadly as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nPreviously, the payments giant partnered with several crypto-native companies, including Binance. The two parted ways in August 2023 after Binance faced a series of legal issues in the U.S. Mastercard re-allowed users to purchase crypto on the exchange again a year later.\n\n\u201cBinance is a great partner of ours,\u201d Dhamodharan said. \u201cWe continue to partner with them in a number of new ways where we can help them with on-ramp and off-ramp. Those are the continuing conversations.\u201d\n\nTaking crypto to the 'next level'\n\nDhamodharan is also optimistic about the future of tokenization, which he said will require new business models to feed the growing demand for tokenization real-world assets by companies like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bIf there is more clarity over time in terms of how deposits can be represented in some form on the public chain, from a regulatory standpoint, I think this can even go to the next level in terms of how it can scale,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2025, Mastercard\u2019s focus lies on the on-ramp/off-ramp between crypto and the banking world, while making that process as smooth and safe as possible as well as expanding features and functions of its Crypto Credential product. The third focus is stablecoins, the company said.\n\n\u201cWe think the future is going to be a world of both deposits because that's where the money is, and that's where people and businesses hold money and stablecoins, which can move on-chain easily and get settled easily.\u201d\n\nRead more: Mastercard and JPMorgan Link Up to Bring Cross-Border Payments on the Blockchain",

            "content": "Ethiopia\u2019s Dashen Bank partners with Accion and Mastercard to connect small businesses to the digital economy with new innovation hub February 18, 2025 | Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n\nAddis Ababa, Ethiopia, February 18, 2025: Dashen Bank, one of Ethiopia\u2019s leading private banks, has partnered with global nonprofit Accion and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth to better serve small businesses with digital financial services customized to meet their financing needs. Accion is supporting Dashen Bank to build an innovation hub that aims to expand digital banking services to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) through a range of new products and a focus on women-owned businesses.\n\nEthiopia\u2019s nearly two million MSMEs are important drivers of its economy, yet only 6% of microenterprises and 1.9% of small enterprises have access to formal credit. The financing gap in the MSME sector of the country is estimated to be $4.2 billion. Unemployment, low incomes, and a lack of financial education remain key reasons for a lack of access to formal financial services. Moreover, only 39% of women \u2014 compared to 55% of men \u2014 have an account at a formal financial institution, preventing them from accessing the evolving digital financial ecosystem and contributing to the country\u2019s economic growth.\n\nDashen Bank has long been at the forefront of introducing innovative digital financial products and services in Ethiopia. It was one of the first banks in the country to launch a digital wallet, which helps small business owners make frictionless transactions. Now, with the new innovation hub being built with Accion, the bank aims to develop new solutions, embedded in existing supply chains for MSMEs in Ethiopia that still largely transact in cash, have few assets, and as a result, remain largely invisible to big banks. The innovation hub is one of the strategic pillars of the Bank's sixth strategy plan designed to enhance its capacity supporting MSMEs. This move is aimed at driving financial inclusion and fostering economic development through innovative digital solutions.\n\nAsfaw Alemu, Chief Executive Officer at Dashen Bank shared, \u201cDespite their critical contribution to the country\u2019s economic growth, small businesses, particularly those led by women, face significant financing challenges. This is largely due to high reliance on cash-based transactions leading to insufficient formal financial records of their business operations and women\u2019s lack of ownership over assets to meet collateral requirements. Through this partnership, we seek to address these challenges, build our operational capacity, enhance our credit offerings to meet the needs of small business owners, and develop a range of digital products and value propositions to help them access the resources they need to grow their businesses successfully. This landmark project underscores our commitment to staying always one step ahead, further cementing our reputation as an industry leader in Ethiopia's financial sector.\u201d\n\nAccording to Yohannes Million, Chief Digital and Information Officer at Dashen Bank, \"Our innovation hub aims to serve as a catalyst for empowering MSMEs by providing them with tailored digital banking solutions. Based in a dedicated facility, it will drive change as a platform where technology and financial services intersect to fuel progress and improve operational efficiency for our customers.\"\n\nThrough strategic partnerships with those supply chains, Accion will help Dashen develop new products designed for MSMEs, using AI to crunch new types of data and develop new credit scoring models that are better suited to the realities of MSMEs, including those that are women-owned. Backed by this new data and extensive research, the innovation hub will build solutions such as credit from their existing suppliers via embedded finance products, and non-financial tools, such as business management support.\n\nDashen Bank has recently issued a tender to initiate the construction of this forward-looking facility. The innovation hub represents another bold step by the bank toward transforming Ethiopia's banking landscape, demonstrating its unwavering commitment to harnessing the power of technology to drive progress and support economic empowerment. As part of its future roadmap Dashen Bank will organize an innovation workshop for its leadership and staff, which will explore opportunities in cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence, in collaboration with a globally recognized technology partner.\n\nRaliat Sunmonu, Vice President, Middle East and Africa, Accion Advisory said, \u201cEthiopia is one of Africa's fastest-growing economies, and small businesses play a vital role in propelling its growth. Through this collaboration with Dashen Bank \u2013 a leader in financial innovation \u2013 and other strategic partners we are helping build a more inclusive ecosystem for MSMEs in Ethiopia. Together, we can deploy artificial intelligence and other tech tools to help remove bias and other roadblocks faced by micro, small, and medium enterprises, especially those led by women.\u201d\n\nSubhashini Chandran, Senior Vice President of Social Impact for Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth said: \u201cEthiopia is at a pivotal point in its journey to drive economic growth through inclusive and relevant services for micro and small businesses. Digital financial services are a critical component of that journey. For the last decade, the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth has been working to advance financial inclusion around the world. We are excited to partner with Accion and Dashen Bank to develop inclusive financial services that can support the growth and resilience of small business owners in Ethiopia.\u201d\n\nThis initiative is part of Accion\u2019s 8-year partnership with the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth that supports the transformation of financial service providers, digital platforms, and fintechs, and aims to help 23 million people across 25 countries benefit from the digital economy.",

            "content": "\"The reliability and scalability of financial systems builds trust,\" says Vikas Arora, the director of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) at Mastercard. As digital transactions become increasingly prevalent in the financial ecosystem, successful next-generation financial technology requires stable, secure, and scalable infrastructure.\n\nThe Essential Role of Site Reliability Engineering in Financial Technology\n\nSystem reliability has become essential to Mastercard's digital payment architecture as the company advances its technology. Processing millions of global transactions each second means that even brief interruptions can create significant financial and reputational risks. Vikas Arora maintains the platform's resilience, responsiveness, and adaptability to meet future technical requirements through his leadership position.\n\nDrawing from his 14 years of IT experience, Vikas Arora has implemented reliability-focused methods that address specific challenges in financial transactions. He leads a team of 23 engineers across the U.S. and India, coordinating the integration of SRE principles throughout Mastercard's digital infrastructure to optimize system performance and reduce service disruptions.\n\nEnhancing Financial Services Through Advanced SRE Methodologies\n\nAs the head of SRE initiatives, Vikas Arora has enhanced performance, security, and compliance by implementing advanced methodologies. His work covers several key areas: He considers how financial risk management intersects with SRE, moving beyond traditional uptime metrics to measure reliability through business risk and regulatory impact.\n\nAdditionally, he has created automated compliance verification systems that work within SRE processes to maintain global standards while preserving system flexibility. Building on this foundation, his approach enables comprehensive monitoring of each transaction's complete lifecycle to ensure swift and accurate digital payments. Complementing these efforts, his team uses predictive analytics and AI to identify and address potential system issues early. This further improves digital service quality.\n\nMeeting the Challenges of Financial Infrastructure Growth\n\nVikas Arora recognizes that maintaining security and compliance while scaling operations presents ongoing challenges as financial systems continue to develop. His SRE initiatives focus on achieving this balance through real-time monitoring, automation, and optimized cloud infrastructure, strengthening the company's ability to handle global financial operations.\n\nProfessional recognition has followed Vikas Arora's accomplishments. His awards at Mastercard include Move Fast (2023) for excellence in high-speed operational efficiency, Own It (2022, 2020) for accountability in critical reliability engineering projects, and Sense of Urgency (2021, 2020) for outstanding incident management and rapid response strategies. Beyond his corporate role, he serves as a judge for The Conrad Challenge, where he evaluates technical innovations from emerging entrepreneurs.\n\nBuilding Tomorrow's Financial Technology Infrastructure\n\nThe success of digital financial services depends on merging advanced technology with consistent reliability. Vikas Arora's expertise guides Mastercard's SRE strategy toward operating with enhanced reliability and expanded capabilities. His focus on building robust systems that maintain security and regulatory compliance while supporting fast growth has proven valuable as digital payment technologies advance.\n\n\"Creating the future of financial technology requires ensuring secure, compliant, and resilient transactions,\" Vikas Arora explains. His systematic approach to reliability engineering has helped establish new transaction processing speed, security, and stability standards.\n\nImplementing System Improvements and Future-Ready Solutions\n\nVikas Arora's methods developed under his guidance have improved system monitoring capabilities, automated routine maintenance tasks, and strengthened security protocols. These improvements allow for faster response times to potential issues while maintaining strict compliance with financial regulations. His team's work has resulted in measurable improvements in system uptime, transaction processing efficiency, and risk management effectiveness.\n\nAs digital payment systems become complex, Vikas Arora's principles and practices provide a foundation for sustainable growth and technological advancement. His focus on integrating reliability engineering with financial technology requirements helps ensure that payment processing systems can adapt to increasing transaction volumes while maintaining security and performance standards.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other forever stocks.\n\nState of The Market in The Wake of The CPI Report\n\nThe first month of 2025 was an interesting one, with inflation rising faster than expected, giving another motivation for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged. The consumer price index, a comprehensive measure of expenses in goods and services throughout the US economy, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% for January, bringing the annual inflation rate to 3%. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the CPI increased 0.4%, bringing the 12-month inflation rate to 3.3%, higher than the projections of 0.3% and 3.1%, respectively. According to Josh Jamner, investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge Investments, the report spells the end of the Fed\u2019s rate-cutting cycles:\n\n\u201cThe \u2018wait and see\u2019 Fed is going to be waiting longer than anticipated after a red-hot January CPI inflation report. This report puts the final nail in the coffin for the rate cut cycle, which we believe is over.\u201d\n\nIn addition, policymakers are also keeping a watch on the White House in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s advocacy for high tariffs, which might boost prices and make it more difficult for the Fed to reach its goal. Speaking on this, James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said the following:\n\n\u201cThere is no getting away from the fact that this is a hot report and with the sense that potential tariffs run upside risk for inflation the market is understandably of the view the Federal Reserve is going to find it challenging to justify rate cuts in the near future,\u201d\n\nWhile the consumer price index release is a widely cited inflation gauge, it isn\u2019t the principal metric the Federal Reserve uses. Rather, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure is the personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish later this month, although it also monitors the CPI and other comparable pricing indices. In his remarks before the House Financial Services Committee on February 12, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the Fed\u2019s increased emphasis on the PCE measure but acknowledged that \u201cwe\u2019re not quite there yet\u201d on inflation, despite the \u201cgreat progress\u201d that has been done so far.\n\nIn such a macroeconomic environment, the notion of acquiring the best \u201cforever stocks\u201d might appear challenging. That said, although investors may gravitate toward riskier options with bigger potential returns, it is crucial to recognize that long-term stock investments have their worth and importance.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWhen it comes to long-term investing, who better to emulate than Warren Buffett, arguably the most well-known investor on Wall Street? To come up with our list of the best forever stocks, we began by evaluating Buffett\u2019s stock portfolio, focusing on stock holdings that had been in his portfolio for at least 5 years. Next, we looked at the number of hedge fund investors linked with each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 funds in the third quarter of 2024. The following names are ranked according to hedge fund sentiments around them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is the world\u2019s second-largest payment processing firm. The firm provides its customers with a wide range of payment processing and related services, such as credit and debit cards, data analytics, settlements, payment deferrals, and more.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) reported sales of $7.5 billion, a 14% rise over the same time the year before. Compared to the previous year, the company\u2019s net income increased to $3.5 billion during the quarter. In addition, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) has provided its customers with 3.5 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards by the end of Q4.\n\nFollowing MasterCard\u2019s fourth-quarter results, Raymond James maintained an Outperform rating on the stock and raised its price target from $614 to $640. The firm emphasized MasterCard\u2019s sustained performance, noting that while the first guidance may result in lower projections, this is mostly due to foreign exchange changes and transaction-related operational expenditures.\n\nQualivian Investment Partners stated the following regarding Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA): Q2 2024 revenues and EPS beat consensus expectations, growing 11% (+13% on a constant currency, CC, basis) and 24% (+27% on a CC basis) respectively. Overall payments volume increased 9%, with highly profitable cross-border volumes growing 17%. Management qualified their expectations for a solid FY2024 anchored around continued stable consumer spending, while noting there is uncertainty regarding the overall macroeconomic backdrop heading into the back half of 2024 and 2025.

            "content": "Payments giant MasterCard is forecasting that central banks will shift away from retail CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) and focus more on offering digital assets to banks and financial institutions.\n\nIn a new blog post from Raj Dhamodharan, MasterCard\u2019s head of crypto and blockchain, the analyst says that he\u2019s expecting central banks will lean away from issuing consumer-based digital currencies and focus on creating digital assets for institutions.\n\nDhamodharan notes that part of the trend may be driven by President Trump\u2019s executive order on digital assets, which specifically instructs the federal government to prevent the creation of a CBDC.\n\n\u201cJust a few years ago, many of the world\u2019s central banks were looking at the feasibility of issuing their own currencies in digital form. Today, more and more central banks have concluded that the private sector is innovating well on its own and that central bank digital currencies aimed at the general public needn\u2019t be a high priority. In fact, another element of Trump\u2019s executive order on digital assets bans the development and issuance of CBDCs, calling them a threat to the stability of the financial system.\n\nIn 2025, I expect that more central banks will follow this trend, moving away from consumer-focused CBDCs, known as \u2018retail\u2019 CBDCs. But they will continue to pursue digital assets aimed at the banking sector and other financial institutions, also known as \u2018wholesale\u2019 CBDCs. These CBDCs could fundamentally increase institutional settlement capabilities and enable the faster movement of capital across jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nLast year, the World Economic Forum (WEF) said that 98% of central banks were planning on issuing their own CBDCs, and anticipated that there could be 24 live CBDCs by 2030.\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

            "content": "Monadnock Paper Mills, Inc., the oldest continuously operating paper mill in the US and an industry leader in sustainable paper solutions, is proud to announce that it has become the first paper mill to achieve Mastercard\u2019s prestigious Card Eco-Certification (CEC). This milestone underscores Monadnock's commitment to sustainability, innovation, and environmental transparency.\n\nMastercard\u2019s CEC certification process was originally developed for plastic cards, making Monadnock\u2019s achievement a significant industry first. Since launching its Sustainable Card Program in 2018, Mastercard has worked to transition more than 168 million plastic cards to recycled and bio-based materials\u2014reflecting a growing push for more responsible alternatives. Since no paper-based card had been certified until now, Mastercard refined its assessment criteria\u2014a considerable task\u2014to account for the unique attributes of fiber-based materials.\n\nA comprehensive Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) is central to this certification, as it evaluates a product\u2019s environmental impact from raw material sourcing to end-of-life disposal. The CEC assessment validates Monadnock's carbon footprint, material sourcing, production processes, and disposal considerations to ensure the highest standards of sustainability. Independent verification was conducted by TruCert, a Canadian-based auditing firm known for its expertise in environmental assessments.\n\nMonadnock's certified product portfolio includes Envi Card Stock 28 pt and Envi Paper Card 30 pt options in both Virgin and 100% Post-Consumer Waste (PC100) content. These substrates provide the industry with a viable, eco-conscious alternative to traditional plastic cards, reducing reliance on fossil fuel-derived materials while maintaining superior quality and performance.\n\n\"Achieving Mastercard\u2019s Card Eco-Certification reinforces our mission to provide high-performance, environmentally responsible fiber-based paper solutions,\u201d says Lisa Taylor, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Monadnock Paper Mills. \u201cIt\u2019s a meaningful step toward greater environmental transparency in the card industry and aligns with our broader Un-Plastic Initiative\u2014helping brands transition to more sustainable materials without compromising quality.\u201d",

            "content": "Analysts globally are also advocating for the GARP strategy. For instance, Brian Belski, chief strategist at BMO Capital, recommended that Canadian investors adopt the GARP approach this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\nThe strategy has gained popularity not just in the US, but also globally. After Global X launched the first global broad-based index exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Australia using the GARP framework in September 2024, the strategy delivered strong early-stage performance. According to a Global X report, while global equity markets experienced a rally towards the end of 2024, the GARP stocks outperformed the broader market and other factors like quality, rising approximately 20% since the ETF's launch. The report also noted that GARP's success wasn't driven by technology, but rather by broader sectors such as consumer goods, financials, and communication.\n\nThe GARP strategy, popularized by Peter Lynch, aims to strike a balance between growth and value investing by avoiding the extremes of either approach. It focuses on finding growth stocks that have relatively low price-to-earnings ratios under typical market conditions. When these stocks are identified successfully, they can offer strong returns for investors. Historically, the GARP Index has outperformed its benchmark by tracking companies that demonstrate consistent fundamental growth, reasonable valuations, and strong earnings potential.\n\nOver the past year, the market has highlighted the importance of diversifying portfolios to manage risk. Selecting stocks that perform well under various economic conditions has consistently been a challenge for investors, as strategies that work in one market may not work in another. For instance, growth and value stocks have shown different performance trends in various market conditions, making both approaches appealing to investors. Combining elements of both strategies can provide a refreshing alternative to traditional investment plans. This is where the GARP strategy comes into play. Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) is an investment strategy that focuses on finding companies with strong, sustainable earnings growth and appealing valuations in relation to their growth potential. These companies are often in sectors with positive growth trends or have competitive advantages that position them for future success.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other GARP stocks that pay dividends.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cGrowth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) remains one of our key style preferences for Canadian equities. Furthermore, earnings growth and revision trends are broadly consistent with the market, suggesting there are likely many opportunities developing in Canada to implement a growth at a reasonable price strategy.\u201d\n\nIn the US, a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices revealed that the GARP Index delivered an average annual return of 13.2% from June 1995 to June 2019, outperforming the broader market\u2019s 9.81% growth. Over the same period, the market\u2019s Growth Index and the Enhanced Value Index returned 10.41% and 11.83%, respectively. The report also highlighted that the GARP Index achieved better risk-adjusted returns compared to both the growth and value indices during this time frame.\n\nA CNBC report also highlighted insights from BMO\u2019s analysts regarding investment strategies to navigate market uncertainties in the U.S. According to the report, investors should consider the GARP approach alongside dividend growth strategies in the current financial landscape. Dividend stocks have historically performed well during inflationary periods, making them a favored choice among investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best GARP stocks that pay dividends.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nGARP stocks have reasonable valuations and strong growth potential, which means that their P/E ratios are not necessarily as low as value stocks. For this article, we used the GARP Index (SPXGARPP) and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked 10 dividend companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. These stocks were ranked based on the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs Mastercard Incorporated (MA) the Best Major Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA woman using a payment terminal at the checkout of a store showing payment products and solutions.\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is an American credit card company that offers a wide range of payment processing and related services to its consumers. The company posted strong earnings in the fourth quarter of 2024, prompting Raymond James to maintain an Outperform rating on the stock and raise its price target from $614 to $640. The firm highlighted MasterCard's consistent performance, noting that while initial guidance may lead to lower projections, this is primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates and transaction-related operating costs.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) generated revenue of $7.5 billion, a 14% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The company\u2019s net income for the quarter was $3.5 billion, up from $3 billion in the previous year.

In fiscal year 2024, the company generated $14.7 billion in operating cash flow, up from $12 billion in 2023. This financial strength allowed it to return $2.4 billion to shareholders through dividends over the year. With 13 years of consecutive dividend growth, MA is considered one of the best GARP stocks that pay dividends. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $0.76 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.54%, as of February 14.\n\nOverall MA ranks 2nd on our list of the best GARP stocks that pay dividends.

Mastercard is one of the largest payment processors in the world by market cap and the number of payments processed.\n\nMastercard was founded in 1966 as Master Charge: The Interbank Card. The company was created to respond to the growing need for a secure and reliable payment processing system. In 1979, the company changed its name to Mastercard. Mastercard is in over 200 countries and territories and serves over 2.8 billion cardholders.\n\nMastercard operates on a business-to-business (B2B) model, providing payment processing services to financial institutions, merchants and governments. The company earns revenue primarily through transaction processing fees, cross-border fees and other value-added services. Mastercard's business is divided into four segments: domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees, transaction processing fees and additional revenue.\n\nMastercard's financial performance has been consistently strong in recent years, with revenue and earnings growth driven by increased transaction volumes and higher fees. Mastercard faces significant competition from other payment processing companies, including Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) and PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL). However, Mastercard has maintained its position as one of the largest payment processors in the world due to its strong brand recognition, global network and innovative technology solutions.\n\nMastercard has consistently invested in innovative technology to enhance its payment processing solutions. One of the company's most significant innovations in recent years is Mastercard's tokenization technology, which provides a secure way to process payments without exposing cardholder data. Mastercard has also invested heavily in contactless payment technology, which has become increasingly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMastercard has a solid commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability. The company has set ambitious goals to reduce its carbon footprint, increase financial inclusion and promote gender equality. Mastercard is also actively involved in philanthropic efforts, including the Mastercard Foundation, which focuses on advancing financial inclusion in Africa.\n\nAs with any company, Mastercard faces several risk factors that could impact its financial performance. One of the most significant risks facing Mastercard is the potential for increased regulation of the payment processing industry. Mastercard is also vulnerable to changes in consumer behavior, such as a shift away from traditional payment methods toward mobile payments. Additionally, Mastercard's business depends on the overall health of the global economy, which could be impacted by factors such as inflation, geopolitical tensions and natural disasters.",

Purchase volume on debit cards was $17.725 in 2023, a 8.6% increase from 2022, according to The Nilson Report. Those are global numbers.\n\nThere were 17.45 billion credit, debit, and prepaid cards in circulation worldwide as of the end of 2023. UnionPay cards made up 56% of total cards, Visa composed 25%, Mastercard made up 17%, and American Express held slightly less than 1%. Discover comprised less than half a percent.\n\nHow many Americans have debit and credit cards?\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta:\n\n232.7 million adults in the U.S. (90%) had a debit card in 2023.\n\n190.4 million adults (82%) had a credit card in 2023.\n\nHow many cards do Americans have?\n\nNot only do most adults in the U.S. hold a debit or credit card or both, but many adults hold more than one. There were 2 billion general purpose credit and debit cards in circulation in the U.S. in 2022, including prepaid debit cards, according to the Nilson Report. 827 million of those cards were credit cards and 1.2 billion were debit cards.\n\nThat's about eight cards per person, although many of those cards were prepaid cards (think of how many gift cards you receive and buy for others over a year).\n\nThe average number of credit cards per person varies by source.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta breaks down the number of credit cards per person among those who have a credit card as follows:",

Mastercard stated that digital currencies could challenge existing payment products by offering benefits such as accessibility, efficiency, and immutability, especially as regulatory frameworks continue to develop.\n\nIn addition to its blockchain efforts, Mastercard reported $28.2 billion in net revenue for 2024, a 12% increase from the previous year. The company\u2019s recognition of stablecoins and crypto as serious competitors reflects the shifting landscape of the global payments market.\n\nStablecoins saw significant volume growth in 2024, with transfer volumes exceeding $27.6 trillion, surpassing the combined volumes of Visa and Mastercard.

            "content": "Mastercard Launches Anti-Money Laundering Service \u201cTRACE\u201d to Combat Financial Crime in Asia Pacific\n\nMastercard today officially announced the launch of TRACE (Trace Financial Crime) in Asia Pacific, a sophisticated network-level solution that harnesses artificial intelligence to identify and prevent money laundering and financial crime. Powered by timely and large-scale payments data from multiple financial institutions, TRACE provides holistic intelligence beyond an individual financial institution\u2019s siloed view, enabling tracing of financial crime across a payments network.\n\nIn recent years, Real-Time Payments (RTP) have seen a rapid rise in use among individuals and businesses across Asia Pacific, allowing transactions to be settled between accounts at different financial institutions within seconds\u2014something which in the past often took a matter of days. However, this speed has also made it a target for money launderers and \u201cmules\u201d, who try to evade detection by moving funds rapidly between multiple accounts. Oftentimes, criminals also involve the accounts of unwitting civilians through methods such as romance and investment scams.\n\nFinancial institutions have largely relied on semi-manual methods or in-house AI solutions to detect these illicit patterns, but these typically rely on their own data and lack the holistic, network-level perspective needed to trace such far-reaching criminal activity. Oftentimes, investigations take weeks to complete. To address this, Mastercard developed TRACE, which uses cutting-edge data science techniques to trace potentially fraudulent transaction patterns across a payments network, as well as providing proactive alerts to banks about suspicious accounts. TRACE incorporates critical data points across an entire domestic network to identify money mules involved in financial crime (such as frauds, scams, etc.), giving financial institutions a network-level perspective they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have.\n\nMastercard\u2019s first Asia Pacific rollout of TRACE was in the Philippines in collaboration with local interbank network BancNet (the switch operator of local RTP service InstaPay), with BancNet having already onboarded 36 domestic banks. The solution allows participating financial institutions to quickly and extensively trace dispersed illicit funds across the RTP system, identify money mule activity throughout the network, and proactively highlight suspected money laundering accounts\u2014all of which will allow them to better adhere to the country\u2019s new Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act (AFASA).\n\n\u201cThe launch of TRACE in Asia Pacific marks a transformative step toward safeguarding the integrity of Real-Time Payments while combatting the corrosive effects of financial crime,\u201d said Matthew Driver, executive vice president, services, Asia Pacific, Mastercard. \u201cBy ensuring that transactions remain secure and compliant, TRACE helps to protect consumers and financial institutions, while also fostering trust in the digital economy\u2014which will be critical for the region\u2019s economic growth. Mastercard is proud to have collaborated with BancNet on its pilot rollout in the Philippines and is ready to collaborate with other stakeholders across the region to implement TRACE to create a stronger, more resilient global financial system.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs scams grow more sophisticated, advanced tech-powered prevention and monitoring capabilities are critical. Our partnership with Mastercard and leveraging TRACE gives us and the network participants the intelligence to help detect fraud faster, making scam prevention sharper and more effective,\u201d said Emmie Reyes, Chief Executive Officer, BancNet.\n\nTRACE is the first network-level solution for RTP systems developed to proactively identify money mules and trace the dispersion of funds. TRACE is network-agnostic and can be quickly and effectively implemented within the payment networks across the region, helping to protect customers from fraud and scams as well as supporting regulatory obligations.\n\nThe United Kingdom is the only other market in the world to have implemented TRACE. Launched by Mastercard in 2018, the solution is now being used by 21 financial institutions and tier-one banks, covering 90 percent of the United Kingdom\u2019s Faster Payments Service network. Since its launch, TRACE has helped identified thousands of mule accounts and is continuing to aid uncover hundreds of new money mule accounts every month.",

And it can.\n\nMastercard continues to play a crucial role in powering economies, from tap-and-go payments to one-click e-commerce to artificial intelligence-powered cybersecurity tools that can calculate risk and find fraud in real time, protecting billions of transactions each year.\n\nIndeed, for nearly two decades, we\u2019ve been pioneering real-time, account-to-account payments. Yet for cards, although it takes milliseconds \u2014 a mere tap \u2014 to authorize a transaction, it can take multiple days for the money to flow into a merchant\u2019s account.\n\nNow we\u2019re scaling the instant economy with product innovations and the Mastercard Transaction Stream, our new processing technology that speeds up the life cycle of payments for consumers, merchants, issuers and acquirers. Real-time card payments will meet the needs of a faster and more complex world for today and tomorrow, freeing up capital for businesses and giving people more transparency and control over their money.\n\nThe potential is immense, with impacts across the economy.\n\nImagine a world where small businesses have more liquidity and same-day access to funds, enabling them to grow faster and avoid burdensome invoicing and payment delays. Financial institutions can share data in real time, enhancing the services they provide to consumers.\n\nWe envision a future where \u201cpending\u201d will be pass\u00e9, with consumers and businesses able to get a snapshot of their true financial situation at any given moment. A future where gig workers get paid when a ride or a delivery is complete, giving them more control over their finances. Fewer people may need payday loans or face overdraft fees. And in a crisis, aid can reach those impacted by natural disasters when they need it.\n\nWe\u2019re accelerating our journey to real-time card payments starting in South Africa, and we look forward to scaling faster card payments around the globe. And our efforts expand beyond speeding up the transaction. Based on the latest messaging standards that facilitate the transfer of more and better-structured transaction data, we can enable easier reconciliation and stronger security. Our technology is future-proofing our network, it\u2019s been configured to enable anyone, anywhere to pay safely and seamlessly with any device, with any payment method, including card, account-to-account, person-to-person and whatever the future has in store. Real needs should be met with real-time action.\n\nWe\u2019re meeting people where they are and moving forward together, setting new standards through what we create and how we operate and providing peace of mind with every payment. We\u2019re innovating for the speed of life.\n\nJorn Lambert is chief product officer at Mastercard. Ed McLaughlin is president and chief technology officer at Mastercard.",

            "content": "Mastercard today officially announced the launch of TRACE (Trace Financial Crime) in Asia Pacific, a sophisticated network-level solution that harnesses artificial intelligence to identify and prevent money laundering and financial crime. Powered by timely and large-scale payments data from multiple financial institutions, TRACE provides holistic intelligence beyond an individual financial institution\u2019s siloed view, enabling tracing of financial crime across a payments network.\n\nIn recent years, Real-Time Payments (RTP) have seen a rapid rise in use among individuals and businesses across Asia Pacific, allowing transactions to be settled between accounts at different financial institutions within seconds\u2014something which in the past often took a matter of days. However, this speed has also made it a target for money launderers and \u201cmules\u201d, who try to evade detection by moving funds rapidly between multiple accounts. Oftentimes, criminals also involve the accounts of unwitting civilians through methods such as romance and investment scams.\n\nFinancial institutions have largely relied on semi-manual methods or in-house AI solutions to detect these illicit patterns, but these typically rely on their own data and lack the holistic, network-level perspective needed to trace such far-reaching criminal activity. Oftentimes, investigations take weeks to complete. To address this, Mastercard developed TRACE, which uses cutting-edge data science techniques to trace potentially fraudulent transaction patterns across a payments network, as well as providing proactive alerts to banks about suspicious accounts. TRACE incorporates critical data points across an entire domestic network to identify money mules involved in financial crime (such as frauds, scams, etc.), giving financial institutions a network-level perspective they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have.\n\nMastercard\u2019s first Asia Pacific rollout of TRACE was in the Philippines in collaboration with local interbank network BancNet (the switch operator of local RTP service InstaPay), with BancNet having already onboarded 36 domestic banks. The solution allows participating financial institutions to quickly and extensively trace dispersed illicit funds across the RTP system, identify money mule activity throughout the network, and proactively highlight suspected money laundering accounts\u2014all of which will allow them to better adhere to the country\u2019s new Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act (AFASA).\n\n\u201cThe launch of TRACE in Asia Pacific marks a transformative step toward safeguarding the integrity of Real-Time Payments while combatting the corrosive effects of financial crime,\u201d said Matthew Driver, executive vice president, services, Asia Pacific, Mastercard. \u201cBy ensuring that transactions remain secure and compliant, TRACE helps to protect consumers and financial institutions, while also fostering trust in the digital economy\u2014which will be critical for the region\u2019s economic growth. Mastercard is proud to have collaborated with BancNet on its pilot rollout in the Philippines and is ready to collaborate with other stakeholders across the region to implement TRACE to create a stronger, more resilient global financial system.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs scams grow more sophisticated, advanced tech-powered prevention and monitoring capabilities are critical. Our partnership with Mastercard and leveraging TRACE gives us and the network participants the intelligence to help detect fraud faster, making scam prevention sharper and more effective,\u201d said Emmie Reyes, Chief Executive Officer, BancNet.\n\nTRACE is the first network-level solution for RTP systems developed to proactively identify money mules and trace the dispersion of funds. TRACE is network-agnostic and can be quickly and effectively implemented within the payment networks across the region, helping to protect customers from fraud and scams as well as supporting regulatory obligations.\n\nThe United Kingdom is the only other market in the world to have implemented TRACE. Launched by Mastercard in 2018, the solution is now being used by 21 financial institutions and tier-one banks, covering 90 percent of the United Kingdom\u2019s Faster Payments Service network. Since its launch, TRACE has helped identified thousands of mule accounts and is continuing to aid uncover hundreds of new money mule accounts every month.",

This dual partnership opens up even more opportunities for travelers to accumulate AAdvantage miles. Combined, these two card issuers currently offer six different American Airlines co-branded credit cards \u2014 four consumer cards and two small-businesses cards.\n\nAll of these options may leave you wondering whether you can have two (or more) American Airlines credit cards. Let's take a look at the bank policies and sign-up bonus restrictions limiting how many American Airlines credit cards you can get.\n\nAmerican Airlines credit cards currently available\n\nWhile there are six American Airlines credit cards currently available to new cardholders through Citi and Barclays, these aren't all of the AAdvantage credit cards in circulation. Both Barclays and Citi continue to service American cards that aren't currently available to new cardholders \u2014 such as the Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Gold World Elite\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae and the AAdvantage\u00ae Aviator\u00ae World Elite Silver Mastercard\u00ae.\n\nHere's an overview of the cards currently available to new cardholders:\n\nCiti American Airlines credit cards\n\nBarclays American Airlines credit cards\n\nAAdvantage\u00ae Aviator\u00ae Red World Elite Mastercard\u00ae: Earn 60,000 AAdvantage\u00ae bonus miles after making your first purchase and paying the $99 annual fee in full, both within the first 90 days. $99 annual fee.\n\nBarclaycard Arrival\u2122 World Mastercard\u00ae: Earn 20,000 bonus miles when you spend $1,000 on purchases in the first 90 days \u2014 that's enough to redeem for a $200 travel statement credit. $0.\n\nBoth of these Barclay AAdvantage credit cards include the following perks:\n\nFirst checked bag free on domestic American Airlines flights.\n\nPreferred boarding on all American Airlines flights.\n\nThe opportunity to earn a Companion Certificate through spending on eligible purchases.\n\n25% in-flight savings.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: The best airline credit cards right now\n\nCiti credit card rules\n\nTechnically, you could apply for and have all four Citi American Airlines credit cards. However, Citi places restrictions on how often you can earn a sign-up bonus and limits how many credit cards you can sign-up for in a set period of time.\n\nRestrictions on sign-up bonuses\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nEach of the four Citi AAdvantage credit cards currently available include similar sign-up bonus restriction language. Here's how the Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae World Elite Mastercard\u00ae offer availability text reads:\n\nAmerican Airlines AAdvantage\u00ae bonus miles are not available if you have received a new account bonus for a Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae account in the past 48 months.\n\nThis means you can't get a new sign-up bonus on the Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae World Elite Mastercard\u00ae if you earned a bonus on this particular card in the past four years. That's the same with each of the four cards. Citi only considers whether you've earned a bonus on that particular card and doesn't factor in other Citi AAdvantage cards you may or may not have held.\n\nWhen calculating if you're eligible, keep in mind that your eligibility date is based on when you earned the bonus \u2014 not when you signed up for the card. Unfortunately, American Airlines only shows AAdvantage account history for the past two years. So, you won't be able to see exactly when you earned a sign-up bonus if you earned it more than two years ago.\n\nCiti restrictions on card applications\n\nIn addition to card-specific sign-up bonus restrictions, Citi restricts how many cards you can be approved for in a short period of time. These unwritten rules aren't published by Citi. Instead, these rules have been compiled by those falling afoul of the rules.\n\nFirst, Citi will typically deny your application for a new credit card if you've applied for a Citi credit card in the past eight days. In addition, you're likely to be denied if you submit more than two applications in a 60-day period. And, if you've applied for a CitiBusiness card recently, you'll want to wait at least 90 days before applying for another CitiBusiness card. To be on the safe side, it\u2019s a best practice to wait for a few more days than required.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: The best travel credit card welcome bonuses right now\n\nBarclays credit card rules\n\nWhile the restrictions on getting Citi American Airlines credit cards are generally understood, that's not the case for Barclays cards. Like Citi, Barclays can restrict which potential cardholders are eligible to earn a sign-up bonus. However, the restrictions aren't as clear.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nFor example, the sign-up bonus restriction on the AAdvantage\u00ae Aviator\u00ae Red World Elite Mastercard\u00ae reads:\n\nYou may not be eligible for this offer if you currently have or previously had an account with us in this program.\n\nBarclays goes on to say that cardholders may not be eligible for a sign-up bonus offer if they \"suspect that the account is being obtained or will be used for abusive or gaming activity.\" Both of these restrictions seem to be designed to allow Barclays to crackdown on cardholders who aren't acting in good faith.\n\nIn addition, Barclays may choose to apply several unwritten rules to card applications. These can include denying a new cardholder for trying to open a new account for a card that they closed less than six months ago or applying for more than one Barclays card in a six-month period. These rules are not set in stone, though, so this will depend on individual situations.\n\nHow many American Airlines credit cards can I have?\n\nIf you have a small business, you can technically get all six American Airlines credit cards currently available to new cardholders. However, if you're starting from scratch, you'll need to be careful to meet all of the restrictions that Citi and Barclays place on credit card applications.\n\nYou'll also want to consider whether it's worth paying the annual fee on more than one American Airlines credit card. Many cards have overlapping spending bonus categories and travel benefits. So, there are diminishing returns on getting more than one card.\n\nHowever, if you're focusing on earning American Airlines miles, it could be worth pairing a few AAdvantage credit cards to maximize your earnings. One strategy may include:\n\nAmerican Airlines AAdvantage\u00ae MileUp\u00ae for 2x earnings at grocery stores with a $0 annual fee.\n\nAAdvantage\u00ae Aviator\u00ae Red World Elite Mastercard\u00ae for up to $25 in statement credits for Wi-Fi purchases, preferred boarding, a first checked bag free and the ability to earn an Anniversary Companion Certificate, all with a $99 annual fee.\n\nCitiBusiness\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae Mastercard\u00ae for 2x earnings on cable and satellite providers, gas stations, and telecommunications merchants; 25% savings on in-flight Wi-Fi; and the ability to spend toward a Companion Certificate, all for an annual fee of $0 intro for the first year, then $99.\n\nTwo American Airlines credit cards, recapped\n\nMake sure to read the offer details carefully. If you've previously held the same card, you may not be eligible to earn a sign-up bonus on that card again. For Citi cards, you'll need to wait at least four years from the date you last earned the sign-up bonus on that card. Meanwhile, Barclays may not approve you for a sign-up bonus if you've ever had the card before.\n\nYou may also have trouble signing up for a card if you've recently applied for a card from the same bank. Best practice suggests that you wait at least eight days between two Citi applications and six months between opening two Barclays cards.",

If you\u2019ve received an invitation by mail or email, you can use the offer code on their website to access the application. As of November 2024, the card targets those who have around a 550 to 620 credit score range, according to Brad Mason, head of card risk and compliance at Seen.\n\nCompared to unsecured \"fee-harvester\" credit cards \u2014 which charge steep annual fees, monthly maintenance fees and account setup fees \u2014 the Seen Mastercard is a more affordable unsecured option. Plus, it has other beneficial features, including comprehensive credit bureau reporting and the potential for a relatively high credit limit. But even still, it may not be the best choice.\n\nFor instance, a no-annual-fee secured credit card can be more cost-effective.

In addition to that cost, some of these cards add on account setup fees and monthly maintenance fees. With the Seen credit card, you don\u2019t have to worry about these excessive costs as you\u2019re trying to rebuild credit.\n\nNo foreign transaction fees: Without this fee and as part of Mastercard\u2019s broad network, this card will be a solid travel companion for making purchases abroad.\n\nA $25 late fee: It\u2019s important to avoid paying late to stay on track with credit-building goals, but if you do have a slip-up, the late fee will be lower compared to those from other issuers.

Learn More\n\nThese are all marks in favor of the Seen Mastercard \u2014 but it\u2019s still possible to save more money with a secured credit card like the $0-annual-fee Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card. It requires a minimum of $200 as a security deposit, but you\u2019ll get it back eventually if you maintain a good payment history and close the account or upgrade to an unsecured credit card with Discover. The issuer reviews your account starting at seven months to see if you qualify for a regular credit card. You\u2019ll also earn 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants on up to $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter, and 1% on all other purchases. As a cardholder, you\u2019ll also get a welcome bonus: INTRO OFFER: Unlimited Cashback Match \u2013 only from Discover. Discover will automatically match all the cash back you\u2019ve earned at the end of your first year! There\u2019s no minimum spending or maximum rewards. Just a dollar-for-dollar match. These incentives can help defray some of the cost of the deposit over time.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

It allows you to choose your deposit amount, but you won\u2019t be able to carry a balance from one month to the next.\n\nAs a result, Chime's card doesn\u2019t charge interest or fees.\n\nSee more from Chime\u00ae Chime says the following: The secured Chime Credit Builder Visa\u00ae Credit Card is issued by The Bancorp Bank, N.A. or Stride Bank, N.A., pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. and may be used everywhere Visa credit cards are accepted. Please see the back of your card for its issuing bank.\n\nTo apply for Credit Builder, you must have an active Chime\u00ae Checking Account. Based on a representative study conducted by Experian\u00ae in January 2024, members who made their first purchase with Credit Builder between June 2022 and October 2022 observed an average FICO\u00ae Score 8 increase of 30 points after approximately 8 months. On-time payment history can have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score. On-time payment history may have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score. Chime will report your activities to Transunion\u00ae, Experian\u00ae, and Equifax\u00ae. Impact on your credit may vary, as Credit scores are independently determined by credit bureaus based on a number of factors including the financial decisions you make with other financial services organizations. Money added to Credit Builder will be held in a secured deposit account as collateral for your Credit Builder Visa card, and you can spend up to this amount. You can use money deposited in your Secured Deposit Account to pay off your charges at the end of every month. Out-of-network ATM withdrawal and over the counter advance fees may apply except at MoneyPass ATMs in a 7-Eleven, or any Allpoint or Visa Plus Alliance ATM.\n\n2. The credit limit has room to grow\n\nAs a cardholder, you\u2019ll start with a credit limit between $300 and $3,000, based on your creditworthiness and other factors. If you\u2019re charged an annual fee, it will also eat into your initial credit limit. For instance, if you have a credit limit of $300 and an annual fee of $59, your amount of available credit will be $241 until you pay that fee back. On a credit-building journey, it\u2019s important to not use more than 30% of your amount of available credit on the card to avoid a negative impact on your credit scores.\n\nEventually, you will be considered for a credit limit increase when you make your minimum payment on time for five consecutive billing cycles. There\u2019s no guarantee you'll get it, but it\u2019s a nice feature when you\u2019re building credit because it could lower your credit utilization ratio. This is the amount of your available credit in use and a key factor that impacts credit scores.\n\n3. The APR is expensive\n\nAs of November 2024, the APR charged for purchases on the Seen Mastercard was nearly 36%, making it very expensive to carry a balance. It\u2019s not uncommon for the annual percentage rate, or interest rate, on a credit card for less-than-ideal credit to be high, so it's critical to make payments on time and in full when possible.\n\nOne possible strategy you can employ is to use the card to pay for small purchases and then pay off the expense in full to avoid interest charges. You\u2019ll further protect yourself from debt or from relying on your credit card if you can work toward building an emergency fund.\n\n4. Payments are reported to all three major credit bureaus\n\nWith the Seen Mastercard, your payments are reported to all three major credit bureaus: TransUnion, Equifax and Experian. It\u2019s an essential feature when you\u2019re rebuilding credit, since these companies record the information that\u2019s used to calculate your credit scores. For this reason, it\u2019s important to stay on track with payments.\n\n5. The card may be used instantly after approval",

Powered by timely and large-scale payments data from multiple financial institutions, TRACE provides holistic intelligence beyond an individual financial institution's siloed view, enabling tracing of financial crime across a payments network.\n\nMastercard (PRNewsfoto/Mastercard)\n\nIn recent years, Real-Time Payments (RTP) have seen a rapid rise in use among individuals and businesses across Asia Pacific, allowing transactions to be settled between accounts at different financial institutions within seconds\u2014something which in the past often took a matter of days. However, this speed has also made it a target for money launderers and \"mules\", who try to evade detection by moving funds rapidly between multiple accounts. Oftentimes, criminals also involve the accounts of unwitting civilians through methods such as romance and investment scams.\n\nFinancial institutions have largely relied on semi-manual methods or in-house AI solutions to detect these illicit patterns, but these typically rely on their own data and lack the holistic, network-level perspective needed to trace such far-reaching criminal activity. Oftentimes, investigations take weeks to complete. To address this, Mastercard developed TRACE, which uses cutting-edge data science techniques to trace potentially fraudulent transaction patterns across a payments network, as well as providing proactive alerts to banks about suspicious accounts. TRACE incorporates critical data points across an entire domestic network to identify money mules involved in financial crime (such as frauds, scams, etc.), giving financial institutions a network-level perspective they wouldn't otherwise have.",

Perks include a $100 annual airline credit, reimbursement for your Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee and a Priority Pass Select membership. The card earns 1 point per dollar on all transactions, and points can be redeemed as 1.5% for cash back or 2% for airfare redemption with no blackout dates. Card rating*: \u2b50\u2b50\u00bd\n\n*Card rating is based on the opinion of TPG's editors and is not influenced by the card issuer.\n\nThe Mastercard Black Card is made from metal, following the trend of well-known cards such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae and The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express. As such, it allures people to join the ranks of metal cardholders.\n\nDespite being similar in material to premium credit cards by playing on the nomenclature of Amex's Black (Centurion) Card, the Mastercard Black Card doesn't offer as many benefits. It comes with a steep annual fee of $495. As a premium card, it has a recommended credit score of 740 or higher.\n\nLet's examine the Mastercard Black Card in depth to compare it to other premium cards and decide whether it deserves a place in your wallet.\n\nThe information for the Centurion Card has been collected independently by The Points Guy.

It's much harder to find substantial value in opening this card without any kind of welcome bonus to earn.\n\nMastercard Black Card benefits\n\nThe Black Card offers several benefits that can help offset its annual fee while also providing cardholders with some conveniences for their travels.\n\nDaily Newsletter Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter Join over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG\u2019s experts Email address Sign up By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy .

Flight-related purchases include airline tickets, bag fees, upgrades and other incidentals charged directly by the airline.\n\nA plus of this benefit is that you don't need to select an airline to use it on, unlike the up to $200 airline statement credit available each calendar year with the Amex Platinum. Enrollment is required; terms apply.\n\nSOUTH_AGENCY/GETTY IMAGE\n\nThe card also offers up to $120 as a statement credit for your Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee. As expected with a travel card, the Black Card has no foreign transaction fees.\n\nIt also comes with a Priority Pass Select membership, giving cardholders access to over 1,500 lounges worldwide. This is a very standard perk on premium travel cards, but it's a nice benefit if you don't have another card that grants access.\n\nThe card provides travel and purchase protections, including:\n\nTrip cancellation and interruption insurance : Receive secondary coverage for a covered round-trip purchase when you use the card. You can be reimbursed for the cost of the nonrefundable round-trip expenses up to $5,000 per person if an accidental, covered event causes you to cancel or interrupt your trip for a covered reason.\n\n: Receive secondary coverage for a covered round-trip purchase when you use the card.

Cardholders are limited to two claims per 12-month period and a $50 deductible per claim.\n\n: Supplemental coverage for damage or theft of your cellphone is up to $800 per claim and up to $1,000 per 12-month period.

Cardholders earn 1 point per dollar spent, with no bonus categories to boost your return.\n\nPIXDELUXE/GETTY IMAGES\n\nWith such poor earning rates, you're better off spending on a no-annual-fee cash-back credit card such as the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae, which earns 1.5% cash back on nonbonus earning categories.\n\nEarning rewards at such a low rate is another reason why this card is on the sidelines when compared to other premium credit cards.\n\nRelated: Best cash-back credit cards\n\nRedeeming rewards on the Mastercard Black Card\n\nRewards can be redeemed through two ways: cash back or airfare. When redeeming for cash back, you'll get a value of 1.5 cents per point.\n\nYou can redeem points for 2 cents each toward airfare, putting it ahead of the competition. Compare this to Chase Sapphire Reserve cardholders, who can redeem points for up to 1.5 cents each when booking through Chase Travel\u2120.\n\nOf course, you can get significantly higher returns by transferring Chase Ultimate Rewards points to airline partners as opposed to redeeming them directly through a portal.\n\nGARY HERSHORN/GETTY IMAGES\n\nNot being able to transfer points to an airline partner is a negative data point for me, as I find far more value in doing so, especially when paired with transfer bonuses, sales or sweet spot redemptions.\n\nI will say that one of the biggest highlights of this card is redeeming for flights at 2 cents apiece, but apart from that, the Black Card really misses the mark in the premium credit card market.\n\nWhich cards compete with the Mastercard Black Card?\n\nIt's no secret that the Black Card isn't winning the praises of credit cards and points and miles enthusiasts. If you receive a mailer to apply for this card, check out the following cards instead, which offer far more value and annual fees similar to the Black Card.\n\nFor additional options, check out our full list of the best premium credit cards.\n\nRelated: Are premium credit cards worth the annual fee?\n\nIs the Mastercard Black Card worth it?\n\nI don't recommend the Black Card to those looking to enter the world of premium credit cards. This card only makes sense to those who want a stylish metal credit card with simple travel-related benefits and a higher redemption rate than other premium cards. Otherwise, receiving a hard inquiry on your credit report for a card with basic benefits, a poor earning rate, limited redemption options and a high annual fee is not worth it.\n\nBottom line\n\nLackluster benefits just to have a black card made from metal that plays on the legacy of the Amex Centurion Card make this a card that should be avoided. A card marketing itself as a premium credit card with a high annual fee must have a better value proposition.\n\nI do place value on the ability to redeem points for 2 cents apiece for airline purchases, but apart from that, the Black Card really misses the mark in the premium credit card market.\n\nApply here: The Black Card\n\nRelated: How to decide if a credit card's annual fee is worth paying\n\nFor rates and fees of the Amex Gold Card, click here.\n\n",

The cost-effective card doesn\u2019t require a security deposit to qualify and won\u2019t charge you activation fees, monthly maintenance fees or other expensive fees. It's issued by First Savings Bank and serviced by Capital Services in South Dakota.\n\nIf you can\u2019t come up with a security deposit for a secured credit card, the Blaze Mastercard is a better choice compared with fee-heavy unsecured card options. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\n1. It charges an annual fee\n\nThe Blaze Mastercard has a $75 annual fee \u2014 but you may not have to be stuck with it forever. As of Jan. 2021, you could contact customer service to ask about qualifying for a lower fee, after establishing a record of on-time payments and managing your account responsibly, according to Alfred Furth, portfolio chief and senior vice president at Capital Services.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nThe fee is on the lower end compared with other unsecured credit cards, but it's worth noting that it's money that you won\u2019t get back. With a secured credit card, the security deposit may be more expensive upfront \u2014 in some cases, several hundreds of dollars \u2014 but you\u2019ll at least get that money back with a good payment history and responsible credit usage.\n\nThe $0-annual-fee Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card, for example, may offer a bit more flexibility with a lower deposit requirement of $49 or $99 if you can qualify. Otherwise, there\u2019s a $200 minimum security deposit requirement.\n\n2. You could eventually qualify for a credit limit increase\n\nIf you have bad credit, you could start out with a fairly low credit limit, like $350. A low credit limit isn't necessarily a deal breaker, though, especially not with this card. You can potentially qualify for a higher credit limit in as little as six months if your account is in good standing and you meet debt-to-income requirements.\n\n3. Late payments won\u2019t hike up your APR\n\nWith the Blaze Mastercard, your credit scores may suffer if you miss a payment, but you won\u2019t get punished with a penalty APR \u2014 an interest rate higher than your card's purchase APR that may be applied to your account balance over several months, increasing your bill. There's a late fee if you miss a payment, though.\n\nAvoid paying late to stay on track with your credit goals. The Blaze Mastercard reports payments to all three major credit bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax and Experian). Paying on time can help you establish a strong payment history, which makes up a good portion of your credit score.\n\n4. It has reasonable fees\n\nAside from late fees, the Blaze Mastercard may charge a returned payment fee of up to $25 and a cash advance fee of 2% per transaction. Beyond those potential charges, though, the Blaze Mastercard is a reasonable and affordable option because you won\u2019t have to worry about monthly fees, activation fees or other pricey fees.\n\nAs a Mastercard with broad merchant acceptance and no foreign transaction fees, it\u2019s also well-equipped to travel internationally.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The Blaze Mastercard charges a fee and a high APR for cash advances, but that\u2019s typical of most credit cards. A cash advance is best reserved as a last resort after you\u2019ve exhausted all other options.\n\n5. You can get a PREMIUM Club membership to access discounts\n\nCardholders have the option of choosing the PREMIUM Club membership, which offers discounts on prescriptions, hotels, dining, car rentals and entertainment. The membership costs $4.95 per month (about $60 annually) and is included on your billing statement.\n\nThe program is worth it only if you can use the discounts enough to offset the cost of the membership fee. Considering that this card already charges a $75 annual fee, that would mean paying about $135 per year to hold this card. That\u2019s treading close to the cost of a security deposit on a secured card, so it\u2019s worth considering one if this amount aligns with your budget.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

All other purchases earn 1%. The Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card requires a minimum of $200 as a security deposit, but you can defray some of the cost with its welcome offer. Plus, it's worth the investment since the card has a possible path to upgrade to an unsecured Discover card. After you've had the card for seven months, the issuer conducts automatic monthly reviews to determine if you\u2019re ready to move to an unsecured card.

Mastercard is one of the largest payment processors in the world by market cap and the number of payments processed.\n\nMastercard was founded in 1966 as Master Charge: The Interbank Card. The company was created to respond to the growing need for a secure and reliable payment processing system. In 1979, the company changed its name to Mastercard. Mastercard is in over 200 countries and territories and serves over 2.8 billion cardholders.\n\nMastercard operates on a business-to-business (B2B) model, providing payment processing services to financial institutions, merchants and governments. The company earns revenue primarily through transaction processing fees, cross-border fees and other value-added services. Mastercard's business is divided into four segments: domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees, transaction processing fees and additional revenue.\n\nMastercard's financial performance has been consistently strong in recent years, with revenue and earnings growth driven by increased transaction volumes and higher fees. Mastercard faces significant competition from other payment processing companies, including Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) and PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL).

Mastercard is in over 200 countries and territories and serves over 2.8 billion cardholders.\n\nMastercard operates on a business-to-business (B2B) model, providing payment processing services to financial institutions, merchants and governments.

            "content": "The Indigo credit card is an option if you're hoping to rebuild your credit, but it'll cost you.\n\nIssued by Utah-based Celtic Bank, the card comes in a variety of different colors and designs, but don\u2019t let that distract you from its potentially high fees. It can provide a costly pathway toward building credit. Even for those with poor credit (FICO scores of 629 or lower), better options exist.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the Indigo Mastercard.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The Indigo credit card is among a handful of products \u2014 including the Milestone card and Destiny card \u2014 serviced by Concora Credit and targeting those with bad credit. All are unsecured cards, meaning they don't require an upfront security deposit, but they do charge expensive fees. Check out our guide to all of the Concora Credit cards here.\n\n1. It can help you build credit ...\n\nThe Indigo credit card reports to all three major credit bureaus: TransUnion, Equifax and Experian. That's ideal for someone trying to build credit because these bureaus collect the information used to calculate your credit scores.\n\nPayment history is a key factor in those scores. As long as you stay on track with payments, you can qualify for better credit cards in the future.\n\n2. ... But it has a costly monthly and annual fee\n\nAs of August 2024, the Indigo credit card charges an annual fee: $175 the first year and $49 thereafter. The higher the annual fee, the less appealing this card becomes. And on top of that, there's also a monthly fee to consider: $0 the first year and $12.50 thereafter (a total of $150 annually). With cards like these, monthly fees are a big red flag.\n\nIn fact, many credit-builder cards let you avoid fees entirely. For instance, you could apply that money toward a secured credit card deposit, which would allow you to build credit and get that deposit back eventually as long as you make on-time payments. (You will not be able to recover the cost of an annual fee or a monthly fee.)\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nFor lower fees, consider: The $0-annual-fee Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card can start you off with a credit limit of $200 for a deposit of $49, $99 or $200, depending on what you qualify for. You can also get access to a higher credit line in as little as six months of paying on time. Whatever amount you deposit, you\u2019ll eventually get it back if you maintain a good payment history. And it doesn't have the high fees of the Indigo card.\n\n3. And those fees can lower your initial credit limit\n\nLet's say you have an account with a credit limit of $300 and a $49 annual fee. In that case, your initial credit limit is really $251 until you pay the fee. The monthly fee can also slightly decrease your credit line further.\n\nA low credit limit also makes it easy to run a high credit utilization, which can hurt your credit even as you\u2019re working to improve it. It\u2019s not worth paying a high annual fee for a credit limit that\u2019s floor-low.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip A secured credit card that earns rewards can offer more value. Consider a card like the $0-annual fee Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card or $0-annual-fee Capital One Quicksilver Secured Cash Rewards Credit Card. With the Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card, you can earn a welcome bonus and 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants on up to $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter. All other purchases earn 1%. The Capital One Quicksilver Secured Cash Rewards Credit Card offers 1.5% cash back on all purchases.\n\n4. The APR runs high\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nA high interest rate is not unheard of on a card that caters to applicants with poor credit. Nevertheless, it means that carrying a balance will be expensive.\n\nAs of August 2024, the APR on the Indigo credit card was nearly 36% for purchases. This rate can be costly if you can't pay your balance in full each month.\n\nFor no interest charges, also consider: The Chime Secured Credit Builder Visa\u00ae Credit Card doesn\u2019t charge fees or interest because you can\u2019t carry a balance from one month to the next. There's also no set security deposit required upfront. You must have a qualifying Chime\u00ae account to fund the card's flexible security deposit, but you get to choose an amount that aligns with your budget.\n\nSee more from Chime\u00ae Chime says the following: The secured Chime Credit Builder Visa\u00ae Credit Card is issued by The Bancorp Bank, N.A. or Stride Bank, N.A., pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. and may be used everywhere Visa credit cards are accepted. Please see the back of your card for its issuing bank.\n\nTo apply for Credit Builder, you must have an active Chime\u00ae Checking Account. Based on a representative study conducted by Experian\u00ae in January 2024, members who made their first purchase with Credit Builder between June 2022 and October 2022 observed an average FICO\u00ae Score 8 increase of 30 points after approximately 8 months. On-time payment history can have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score. On-time payment history may have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score. Chime will report your activities to Transunion\u00ae, Experian\u00ae, and Equifax\u00ae. Impact on your credit may vary, as Credit scores are independently determined by credit bureaus based on a number of factors including the financial decisions you make with other financial services organizations. Money added to Credit Builder will be held in a secured deposit account as collateral for your Credit Builder Visa card, and you can spend up to this amount. You can use money deposited in your Secured Deposit Account to pay off your charges at the end of every month. Out-of-network ATM withdrawal and over the counter advance fees may apply except at MoneyPass ATMs in a 7-Eleven, or any Allpoint or Visa Plus Alliance ATM.\n\n5. The optional programs can add to its cost\n\nDuring the application process, you\u2019re offered the option to enroll in certain programs for a fee.\n\nOverlimit coverage\n\nRare indeed is the card that charges an overlimit fee these days; those have essentially been extinct for years. But it's an option with the Indigo credit card, and it allows you to go over your credit limit for a fee of up to $41. The issuer may also charge two additional overlimit fees if the new balance continues to exceed the credit limit as of the payment due date in future billing cycles. Only one fee per billing cycle will apply even if you exceed your credit limit several times within that same cycle. It\u2019s a potentially steep cost to pay considering that the issuer may still decline a transaction if you haven\u2019t yet established a payment history, the account isn\u2019t in good standing, or the credit limit is significantly exceeded.\n\nCredit protection\n\nThe credit protection option may allow for your minimum payment or monthly statement balance to be canceled for a certain amount of time if you have a qualifying circumstance. Eligible situations may include involuntary unemployment, a disability, hospitalization, loss of life, a natural disaster or an auto repair of $250 or more. If you opt into this protection, a monthly fee of $1.49 per $100 of your ending balance on your billing statement will apply regardless of whether you\u2019re approved for such protection. For instance, if your monthly statement balance is $300, the fee would be $4.47. No fee applies if you pay off your balance in full by the payment due date. Terms apply.\n\nThe Indigo credit card is already expensive enough as it is, so It\u2019s not worth paying for these add-ons. Plus, these kinds of features can foster unhealthy habits like exceeding your credit limit, which can negatively impact your credit scores. If you feel you need to enroll in overlimit coverage or credit protection, know that you can cancel at any time.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Instead of paying a fee for an option like credit protection, consider setting aside money in an emergency fund. If you can qualify for an online savings account, monthly maintenance fees likely won\u2019t apply and you\u2019ll earn interest on the balance.",

The company\u2019s growing expertise in AI, largely built in-house, is enhancing its business mix.\n\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\n\nInvestors have responded positively, pushing MA stock up 3% since the impressive earnings, bringing it close to its 52-week high of $576.94. With shares near record levels, the key question is: Should investors take profits, or does Mastercard have more room to grow?\n\n3 Major Takeaways From Mastercard\u2019s Q4 Earnings\n\nEarnings & Sales Beat: Mastercard\u2019s EPS of $3.82 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8% and grew 20% year over year. Also, the top line of $7.5 billion beat the consensus mark by 1.4% and improved 14% from a year ago. For a detailed analysis, read our blog: Mastercard Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates on GDV & Transactions Growth.\n\nMajor Metrics Continue to Rise: MA\u2019s gross dollar volume grew 12% year over year on a local-currency basis to $2.6 trillion and met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. On a local currency basis, the cross-border volume climbed 20% year over year in the quarter under review. Also, its switched transactions grew 11% year over year.\n\nGrowing Services Business: Mastercard is investing heavily to meet the growing demand for its service offerings like cybersecurity and data analytics, facilitating its diversification efforts. In the fourth quarter, these services contributed 41% of total net revenues, with value-added services generating $3.1 billion, up 16% year over year. This growth was fueled by increasing demand for consumer acquisition, engagement, and business and market insights.\n\nThe company\u2019s security, digital authentication and pricing strategies continue to strengthen this segment. Mastercard\u2019s business model functions as a data-driven cycle, where network transactions generate valuable insights that power cybersecurity solutions and targeted marketing services. Its AI capabilities, bolstered by the Brighterion acquisition in 2017, play a crucial role in preventing cyber threats and enhancing data-based marketing strategies to improve ad targeting for clients.\n\nMastercard's Long-term Growth Drivers\n\nMastercard\u2019s expansion in emerging markets, particularly in Southeast Asia and Latin America, positions it for long-term growth. These efforts are helping offset revenue lost from its exit from Russia. With millions of underbanked consumers in these regions, Mastercard has a significant opportunity to grow its global footprint.",

The $0-annual-fee card earns:\n\n5% back on Walmart.com purchases and on items purchased through the Walmart app (including items you buy online for in-store pickup as well as for Walmart Grocery Pickup and Delivery).\n\n2% back on in-store purchases at Walmart (including at both Murphy USA and Walmart gas stations), as well as on travel and restaurant expenses.\n\n1% back on everything else.\n\nThere's no traditional upfront bonus or 0% intro APR offer, but those ongoing rewards are among the highest you'll find on a store credit card. And because Walmart sells basically everything, you can earn bonus rewards on, well, basically everything \u2014 not to mention in several common household categories.\n\nHere's how that compares with other top cards.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae offers the following incentive for new cardholders: Earn 5% back on purchases in Walmart stores when you use this card in Walmart Pay for the first 12 months after approval. Walmart Pay is a digital wallet accessible through the Walmart app that allows you to use your phone to pay at checkout. As a temporary bonus category that requires a specific payment method, it is not factored into the comparisons below.\n\nPrime Visa\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nAnnual fee: $0, but an annual Amazon Prime membership is required, starting at $139 per year ($69 per year for students).\n\nRewards: 5% back at Amazon.com and Whole Foods Market; 2% back at restaurants, gas stations, plus local transit and commuting (including rideshare); 1% back on all other purchases.\n\nSign-up bonus: Get a $100 Amazon Gift Card instantly upon approval exclusively for Prime members.\n\nAPR: The ongoing APR is 19.49%-28.24% Variable APR.\n\nHow it compares with the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae: The Prime Visa has the same 5%/2%/1% rewards split, just in different categories \u2014 but there's one Prime question, literally: How much is Amazon Prime worth to you? Membership is a costly requirement, and there's no membership needed for the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae. But Prime does pack a ton of perks, including free shipping. Walmart.com orders under $35 have a shipping fee. Brand loyalty also factors in. If you make Whole Foods your go-to grocer, you'll net 5% back with the Prime Visa. The Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae can match that, but only for groceries at Walmart.com, and only for pickup or delivery. Both cards offer a way to earn 2% back on gas, but you would have to buy all of your gas at Walmart fuel stations with the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae.\n\nTravel Rewards Expert Reveals...

The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nAnnual fee: $0.\n\nRewards: 5% discount on all eligible Target purchases.\n\nSign-up bonus: N/A.\n\nAPR: The ongoing APR is 28.95%, Variable APR.\n\nHow it compares with the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae: Target offers three cards: A debit card; a Mastercard that can be used virtually anywhere; and the Target Circle\u2122 Credit Card, which can be used only within the Target brand. The Mastercard isn't available for direct applications but may be offered as an upgrade from the Target Circle\u2122 Credit Card. Still, all Target cards give you the same upfront 5% discount on eligible Target or Target.com purchases, which may be easier than keeping track of different rewards rates. Like Walmart, Target already offers free shipping on orders over $35 \u2014 but unlike the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae, the Target Circle\u2122 Credit Card extends that benefit to orders under $35 as well (with some exceptions). You'll also get a 10% discount every cardholder anniversary, plus an extended return policy \u2014 neither of which is available with the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae. What you won't get with any Target card, however? Rich ongoing rewards on spending outside of Target.\n\nCostco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nAnnual fee: $0. But you must have a Costco membership, which starts at $65 per year.\n\nRewards: 4% cash back on eligible gas and EV charging purchases for the first $7,000 per year and then 1% thereafter; 3% back on restaurants and eligible travel purchases; 2% back at Costco and Costco.com; 1% back on all other spending.\n\nSign-up bonus: N/A.\n\nIntro APR: The ongoing APR is 19.49%-27.49% Variable APR.\n\nHow it compares with the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae: The Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi offers higher rewards on gas, travel and restaurant spending than the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae, and the same 2% back on in-store purchases. However, to get the card you must have a Costco membership, and that isn't free. Plus, unlike the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae, there's not a lot of redemption flexibility. With the Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi, you get your rewards once a year in the form of a certificate. Redemption choices are limited to cash back or merchandise.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The Sam's Club\u00ae Mastercard\u00ae is another co-branded wholesale club card option, and similar pros and cons apply: higher rewards, but a membership fee. The card is worth noting, though, given its exceptional rewards rate on gas and the relatively low annual cost of Sam's Club membership.

The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nAnnual fee: $0.\n\nRewards: 2% cash back on every purchase: 1% back when you buy, 1% back as you pay for those purchases.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 cash back after you spend $1,500 on purchases in the first 6 months of account opening. This bonus offer will be fulfilled as 20,000 ThankYou\u00ae Points, which can be redeemed for $200 cash back..\n\nAPR: 0% intro APR on balance transfers for 18 months, and then the ongoing APR of 18.24%-28.24% Variable APR.\n\nHow it compares with the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae: The Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card isn't a store card, but you could consider this flat-rate cash-back card a good one to use at any store, whether you shop online or in person. For the latter group \u2014 and there are likely many shoppers who prefer to browse Walmart's physical aisles rather than its virtual ones \u2014 this card can earn you the same cash-back rate there as the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae does, but you'll earn it everywhere else, too, as opposed to only on travel and restaurant spending. No need to keep track of bonus categories. The 0% intro APR offer could also be helpful if you're looking for some breathing room on existing debt.\n\nDiscover it\u00ae Cash Back\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nAnnual fee: $0.\n\nRewards: 5% cash back in rotating quarterly categories on up to $1,500 in purchases each quarter (requires activation); 1% back on all other purchases. In the past, bonus categories have included things like grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants and more.\n\nWelcome bonus: INTRO OFFER: Unlimited Cashback Match for all new cardmembers \u2013 only from Discover. Discover will automatically match all the cash back you\u2019ve earned at the end of your first year! There\u2019s no minimum spending or maximum rewards. You could turn $150 cash back into $300.\n\nAPR: 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers, and then the ongoing APR of 18.24%-27.24% Variable APR.\n\nHow it compares with the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae: The Walmart Rewards Mastercard's highest rewards rate tops out at 5% and is limited in scope, but the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back offers the ability to earn 5% back in several categories on a rotating quarterly basis throughout the year. It's a good pick for seasonal shoppers: Consider that its 5% bonus categories for Q4 2019 are Walmart.com, Amazon.com and Target (in-store and online). Now that's some serious variety for your holiday shopping needs. And while the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae offers no traditional upfront sign-up bonus, the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back features a potentially lucrative one.\n\nBlue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nAnnual fee: $0 intro annual fee for the first year, then $95.\n\nRewards: 6% cash back* at U.S. supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%); 6% back on select U.S. streaming subscriptions; 3% back at U.S. gas stations and on transit (including taxis/rideshare, parking, tolls, trains, buses and more); 1% back on all other purchases. Terms apply (see rates and fees).\n\nWelcome offer: Earn a $250 statement credit after you spend $3,000 in purchases on your new Card within the first 6 months. Terms Apply.\n\nAPR: 0% intro APR for 12 months on purchases and balance transfers, and then the ongoing APR of 18.24%-29.24% Variable APR.\n\nHow it compares with the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae: The Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express offers some of the highest cash-back rewards you'll find on groceries, but it does pack a $0 intro annual fee for the first year, then $95. You would have to spend only about $31 per week in that category to break even on that annual fee, and that doesn't even take into account the card's generous welcome offer or its earnings on streaming services, gas and transit. On typical everyday household expenses, the Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express outearns the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae in most areas, with one potentially deal-breaking exception: online shopping. You should also be aware that with the Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express, superstores like Walmart and wholesalers like Sam's Club aren't considered bonus categories, meaning you'd earn only a meager 1% back at such retailers.\n\n*Cash Back is received in the form of Reward Dollars that can be redeemed as a statement credit or at Amazon.com checkout.",

It takes time and repetition and requires the kind of discipline that, for many of us, is hard to access.\n\nThat's where gamification comes in. The idea behind this strategy is that by introducing the elements of a game - competition, rewards and fun - you can motivate people to make better choices again and again until they become habits. Tech companies are using it to build tools that, for example, help kids with diabetes more efficiently manage their blood sugar by monitoring a baby dragon's blood sugar.\n\nFinancial institutions can harness this same technology to advance inclusion. As banks look for ways to build trust and encourage people to use digital tools that can help them better manage their finances, gamification is proving to be a powerful option, especially in Latin America, where account ownership and financial digitalization is growing faster than in other regions.\n\nGamification can help those new users improve their financial health and become long-term customers of banks. Studies have shown that gamification can help people financially stay on track with things like bill and loan payments, which means better credit, more financial stability and a strengthened relationship with their bank.\n\n\"Moving people from access to usage of financial tools can go a long way toward building a more financially inclusive world, but getting people to usage is still a challenge,\" says Natasha Jamal, vice president of social impact for Mastercard Strive, a global program that helps small businesses around the world to thrive in the digital economy.\n\nMaking financial services fun\n\n\"Part of the challenge is that in some cultures, simply talking about money can be taboo,\" says Pedro Moura, co-founder of Flourish Fi, a California-based fintech that combines gamification with behavioral science to increase customer loyalty and engagement with financial institutions across the Americas. That means consumers are missing the knowledge they need to embrace healthy financial habits, and banks have an opportunity to help with that financial education. When money isn't discussed, good money management can feel out of reach.\n\n\"This can be as simple as paying their bills on time, building a little bit of a rainy-day fund or making smarter decisions in their financial lives,\" says Moura, who was the first in his family to access financial services in the U.S. after they emigrated Brazil. \"We're turning that interaction from transactional into a fun element.\"",

Mastercard is one of the largest payment processors in the world by market cap and the number of payments processed.\n\nMastercard was founded in 1966 as Master Charge: The Interbank Card. The company was created to respond to the growing need for a secure and reliable payment processing system. In 1979, the company changed its name to Mastercard. Mastercard is in over 200 countries and territories and serves over 2.8 billion cardholders.\n\nMastercard operates on a business-to-business (B2B) model, providing payment processing services to financial institutions, merchants and governments. The company earns revenue primarily through transaction processing fees, cross-border fees and other value-added services. Mastercard's business is divided into four segments: domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees, transaction processing fees and additional revenue.\n\nMastercard's financial performance has been consistently strong in recent years, with revenue and earnings growth driven by increased transaction volumes and higher fees. Mastercard faces significant competition from other payment processing companies, including Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) and PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL). However, Mastercard has maintained its position as one of the largest payment processors in the world due to its strong brand recognition, global network and innovative technology solutions.\n\nMastercard has consistently invested in innovative technology to enhance its payment processing solutions. One of the company's most significant innovations in recent years is Mastercard's tokenization technology, which provides a secure way to process payments without exposing cardholder data. Mastercard has also invested heavily in contactless payment technology, which has become increasingly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMastercard has a solid commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability. The company has set ambitious goals to reduce its carbon footprint, increase financial inclusion and promote gender equality. Mastercard is also actively involved in philanthropic efforts, including the Mastercard Foundation, which focuses on advancing financial inclusion in Africa.\n\nAs with any company, Mastercard faces several risk factors that could impact its financial performance. One of the most significant risks facing Mastercard is the potential for increased regulation of the payment processing industry. Mastercard is also vulnerable to changes in consumer behavior, such as a shift away from traditional payment methods toward mobile payments. Additionally, Mastercard's business depends on the overall health of the global economy, which could be impacted by factors such as inflation, geopolitical tensions and natural disasters.",

            "content": "Buffett\u2019s dividend investing strategy isn\u2019t centered on chasing the highest yields. Instead, he focuses on finding strong, well-managed companies that can sustain and grow their dividends over time. He favors steady, reliable businesses with moderate yields over riskier stocks with higher payouts. Given Buffett\u2019s track record, it\u2019s clear that his approach is well-founded, as dividend stocks have played a crucial role in overall market returns. Between 1993 and the end of 2022, the broader market rose by 777%, but when dividends were included, the total return exceeded 1,400%. This highlights the significant contribution of dividends, accounting for more than 20% of the market\u2019s overall gains during that period.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to trade things all the time; you can sit on things, too. You don\u2019t have to make many decisions in life to make a lot of money.\u201d\n\nBuffett's commitment to holding stocks for the long term is often seen as a crucial element of his investment success. Peter Kunhardt, a director of the HBO documentary \u201cBecoming Warren Buffett\u201d, made the following comment in his 2017 interview:\n\nDividend stocks have long been a cornerstone of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio, accounting for over 90% of its holdings. Buffett\u2019s preference for dividend-paying stocks has frequently been discussed in the media, especially given that Berkshire itself does not distribute dividends. He is recognized for his disciplined approach, focusing on acquiring stocks with the intention of holding them for extended periods\u2014often spanning years or even decades. This long-term outlook enables him to take advantage of compounding returns while staying resilient through market fluctuations. His strategy has delivered strong results, with the portfolio overseen by Buffett and his team expected to generate approximately $6 billion in annual dividend income. Notably, just seven companies are anticipated to generate $4.5 billion in annual dividends for his company.\n\nWarren Buffett is a widely recognized name in the investment world, known for his influence and expertise. His strategies are closely followed by many aspiring investors, reflecting the high regard in which he is held. What sets Buffett apart is his steadfast commitment to the investment principles that have guided him throughout his career, with a strong focus on value investing. In addition to value strategy, Buffett is also inclined toward dividend stocks.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks To Invest In Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nExamining the performance of dividend stocks over earlier periods reveals that they have played a substantial role in overall market returns. Dividends have historically been a major contributor to the total returns of US stocks, making up nearly one-third of overall equity gains since 1926. From 1980 to 2019, a period characterized by declining interest rates, dividends accounted for 75% of the broader market\u2019s returns. In such environments, dividends become even more valuable, providing consistent income when bond yields are lower. Companies that start paying dividends tend to maintain them and often increase their payouts over time. In addition, issuing dividends can make a stock more attractive to investors, potentially driving up its market value.\n\nBy the close of Q3 2024, most companies in Buffett\u2019s portfolio had a strong track record of paying dividends and steadily increasing them over time. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in Warren Buffett\u2019s portfolio.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we analyzed Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s 13F portfolio as of the third quarter of 2024 and identified dividend stocks. From that group, we picked 13 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, tracked by Insider Money as of Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs Mastercard Incorporated (MA) the Best Stock for Beginners with Little Money According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA woman using a payment terminal at the checkout of a store showing payment products and solutions.\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a New York-based credit card company that offers a wide range of payment processing and related services to its consumers. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $7.5 billion, reflecting a 14% increase compared to the same period the previous year. The company's net income for the quarter reached $3.5 billion, rising from $3 billion in the prior-year period. As of December 31, 2024, a total of 3.5 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards had been issued to customers.\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) has delivered an over 23% return to shareholders in the past 12 months. The company has gained investor confidence due to its robust growth, substantial competitive edge, and ability to withstand challenging economic conditions. Its primary source of revenue comes from swipe fees, earning slightly over 2% per transaction on co-branded cards. This simple yet dependable business model enables strong performance during favorable market conditions while shielding the company from credit risks during economic downturns.\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) maintained a strong cash position, closing the quarter with more than $8.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, while total assets exceeded $19.7 billion. In fiscal year 2024, the company generated $14.7 billion in operating cash flow, an increase from $12 billion in 2023. This financial strength enabled it to return $2.4 billion to shareholders through dividends over the year. With 13 consecutive years of dividend growth under its belt, MA is one of the best dividend stocks according to Warren Buffett.

            "content": "As part of Mastercard\u2019s plan to remove the 16-digit number from its credit and debit cards by 2030, Australia\u2019s AMP Bank is rolling out the first numberless debit card for small businesses.\n\nAMP, a mobile-first bank, is introducing the cards to both its small business and personal banking customers. Other Australian banks plan to launch similar cards over the next year.\n\nMastercard is promoting the cards as a way to provide AMP Bank customers with seamless and secure payment technology. It claims that removing the 16-digit number from debit cards will help stamp out identity theft and fraud. The traditional card numbers will be replaced with a mix of tokenization and biometric authentication.\n\nCustomers would still have physical cards for in-person payments, but Mastercard\u2019s plan is to replace static 16-digit credit card numbers with tokens generated by the customer\u2019s banking app, ensuring that actual card information is never shared. Roughly 25% of worldwide Mastercard transactions are already tokenized, and the company reports that these transactions are growing at a 50% year-over-year rate.\n\nAMP customers are encouraged to use Face ID and fingerprint ID to access the debit card app. The bank also recommends recording a video selfie during sign-up to help prevent identity theft.\n\nA Slow Rate of Development\n\nMastercard\u2019s first numberless card isn\u2019t technically the first of its kind, though the development of such products has been slow. In 2019, Mastercard partnered with Apple to launch an iPhone-integrated credit card that didn\u2019t feature a traditional 16-digit number. At the time, the lack of a number wasn\u2019t as noticeable, since the card largely functioned through the Wallet app. The physical card, which lacked both a number and a CVV, was seen more as a backup.\n\nThis shift toward numberless cards became more evident as other companies began to follow suit. After expanding to the UK, Chase introduced its first product: the Chase UK numberless debit card, which has yet to be launched in the U.S. Similar cards have also been offered in regions like Mexico and the Middle East.\n\nHowever, the uptake of numberless cards across the industry has been slow. While some consumers may prefer the sleek esthetics of a card without numbers, the security benefits seem to have been overshadowed by other fraud-prevention measures.\n\n\u201cNumberless cards can help reduce fraud, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a key factor,\u201d said Elisa Tavilla, Director of Debit Payments at Javelin Strategy & Research. \u201cThere are so many other security tools that exist today.\u201d",

            "content": "Here's a look at the two payment processing companies and which stock is better for dividend investors.\n\nMastercard (MA 1.18%) and Visa (V 0.64%) are incredibly similar payment processing companies with comparable product offerings and overlapping customers. As investments, both stocks have reliable track records and grow their dividends consistently, making them solid choices for investors seeking steady income with minimal risk.\n\nBut which one is the better buy right now? While they may seem almost identical, differences in financials, capital allocation strategies, and stock valuations could tip the scales. Let's take a closer look to see which one stands out today.\n\nHere are the recent financial results for Mastercard and Visa\n\nBefore digging into the financials of these two payment giants, it's important to note that Visa has a higher market capitalization at $674 billion compared to Mastercard's $519 billion, meaning it is the larger of the two companies and will have higher overall. Mastercard and Visa recently reported their December 2024 quarterly results, so let's look at their top and bottom lines to get a sense of each company's recent growth.\n\nDuring fourth-quarter 2024, Mastercard generated $7.5 billion in net revenue, translating to net income of $3.3 billion. These figures represent year-over-year growth of 14% and 20%, respectively. In comparison, Visa generated $9.5 billion in net revenue and $5.1 billion in net income for the fiscal first quarter, equating to year-over-year growth of 5%.\n\nWhile Mastercard is currently outpacing Visa in growth, Visa maintains a critical advantage -- its operating margin remains an industry-leading 66%, compared to Mastercard's 56.3%. Operating margin is a key metric because it demonstrates a company's ability to generate operating profit after accounting for operating expenses and the cost of goods sold.\n\nCompany Net Revenue (YoY Growth) Operating Margin Net Income (YoY Growth) Market Capitalization Mastercard $7.5 billion (14%) 56.3% $3.3 billion (20%) $519 billion Visa $9.5 billion (10%) 66% $5.1 billion (5%) $674 billion\n\nOverall, let's give Mastercard the slight edge for growing its top and bottom lines at a better clip than Visa. Still, it is important to note Visa's best-in-class operating margin as an honorable mention.\n\nMastercard and Visa prioritize shareholders\n\nMastercard and Visa management teams have similar capital allocation strategies in that they both regularly increase their dividends and repurchase shares of their companies. Both strategies benefit shareholders, with income in the case of dividends and increased ownership in the case of stock buybacks.\n\nFirst, Mastercard has paid and raised its dividend for 14 consecutive years. Its most recent raise was 15%, bringing its quarterly dividend to $0.76 per share or 0.54% annual yield. Mastercard's payout ratio -- the percentage of a company's earnings paid out as dividends -- is notably low at 19%. For reference, a prolonged payout ratio of 75% or higher usually signals that a stock's dividend is in danger of being cut or dropped altogether.\n\nVisa has paid and raised its quarterly dividend for 16 consecutive years, with its last raise coming in at 13%. Today, Visa pays a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, which equates to an annual yield of 0.68% and a payout ratio of about 22%.\n\nBoth companies regularly participate in share repurchases in an effort to consistently lower their share count. Over the past three years, Mastercard lowered its shares outstanding from 980 million to 914 million, a decrease of 6.7%. Meanwhile, during the same period, Visa reduced its shares outstanding from 2.13 billion to 1.93 billion, a decrease of 9.4%.\n\nNeither management appears to be slowing down soon. At the end of the most recently reported quarters, Mastercard had $15.1 billion remaining on its share repurchase programs, and Visa had $9.1 billion remaining.\n\nOverall, both companies represent some of the most shareholder-friendly stocks available on the public market. Still, Visa has a slight edge in this category, given its higher annual yield and share count reduction over the past few years.\n\nAn overview of Mastercard's and Visa's valuations\n\nConsidering these competitors' similarities, one last comparison we can make is each stock's valuation. For well-established companies such as Mastercard and Visa, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio -- measuring a company's current market price to its trailing 12 months of earnings per share -- fits the bill. As of this writing, Mastercard and Visa traded at P/E ratios of 41 and 35, respectively. Since Mastercard has a higher growth rate, it historically has a higher P/E ratio, with its five-year median being 38 compared to Visa's 32.\n\nWith that said, both management teams expect their respective revenue to grow in the low double digits for their respective fiscal 2025 years. There's an argument that Mastercard may not deserve the same premium as it has enjoyed in recent years. Additionally, Visa has a slightly better balance sheet, with $6.3 billion in net debt compared to Mastercard's $9.5 billion.\n\nGiven those factors, Visa is the better value stock and wins the final category.\n\nIs Mastercard or Visa the better stock for dividend investors?\n\nTo reiterate, both Mastercard and Visa have proven to be fantastic long-term investments, and there's no reason to doubt their futures or continued dividend growth potential. However, if you were to pick between the two right now, Visa would be the better stock because of its higher dividend yield, comparable growth projections, and more attractive valuation.",

The company will replace them with on-device biometrics and tokenization to combat identity theft and fraud. The initial rollout of these numberless cards will begin in Australia, in partnership with local banks.\n\nOther financial institutions are expected to follow suit over the next 12 months. Mastercard\u2019s commitment extends to eliminating manual card entry and static passwords, adopting more secure authentication methods. Removing card numbers adds a layer of security by preventing unauthorized usage when the physical card is not present.\n\nThe ultimate goal may be to eliminate physical cards altogether, allowing consumers to rely entirely on biometrics for payments. Mastercard is also promoting its Click to Pay system to simplify and secure online transactions. This feature allows consumers to make online payments without inputting long card numbers and addresses, making the process faster and more secure.\n\nSimon Forbes, Division President for the UK and Ireland at Mastercard, explains, \u201cThe secure process called \u2018tokenization\u2019 replaces the card number with random numbers, or tokens, for each transaction, which are meaningless if stolen.\n\nMastercard introduces enhanced payment security\n\nThis not only protects consumers from scammers but also protects retailers from cybersecurity and data breach threats.\u201d\n\nConsumers can register their card with Click to Pay via their banking app or look for the Click to Pay icon at checkout, streamlining the payment process while enhancing security.\n\nThe push to remove card numbers from physical credit cards marks a significant shift for the banking industry, which has dealt with card fraud since the 1960s. Recent measures, like chip-based and contactless cards, have not fully stopped card fraud, with Australian card details still being sold on dark web markets. Mastercard, a leader in fintech innovation, sees numberless cards as a solution to fraud.\n\nBy shifting to a model where 16-digit card numbers are replaced with encrypted tokens, Mastercard aims to make transactions more secure. These tokens can be generated and revoked quickly, used at specific merchants, or have built-in expiration dates, reducing their value on the dark web and leaving cybercriminals with fewer opportunities. The adoption of numberless cards is part of a broader trend towards mobile wallets, tap-to-pay, and other digital payment methods, offering both convenience and improved security.\n\nThe introduction of numberless cards also includes integration with accounting software for better expenditure tracking and identity confirmation through customer devices, reducing overall fraud risk. Mastercard Australasia division president Richard Wormald praised the approach, highlighting its value for small business owners. \u201cDigital banking has transformed the way we manage our money as consumers, but small business owners often miss out on that same seamless experience,\u201d Wormald said.\n\n\u201cNumberless cards represent a significant step forward in payment security, offering additional protection against fraud and account compromise.\u201d",

Now, Mother Monster is calling on you to be a part of her world of mayhem.\n\nLady Gaga is partnering with Mastercard to host a one-of-a-kind dance contest as a way to connect with and celebrate her fans. All you have to do is learn the video\u2019s choreography and post it on social media using the hashtag #MastercardGagaContest by Sunday, February 16 before midnight. Enter on priceless.com/Gaga with #MastercardGagaSweepstakes. Once selected, fans will meet on set in Los Angeles to recreate a fan version of \u201cAbracadabra\u201d and win an invitation to Lady Gaga\u2019s Club Mayhem dance party.\n\nThe music video\u2019s motto is dance or die. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for passion and heart,\u201d Goebel said.\n\n\u201cAbracadabra\u201d is a theatrical masterpiece with multiple visuals and themes. \u201cI think people just see it as choreography but there\u2019s a lot of layers to it,\u201d Goebel admitted when asked about the video\u2019s message.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing with the different sides of Gaga and how they all coexist. You can see that in the music video, it\u2019s like her versus herself and two different versions of her. There\u2019s a story of innocence in there as well as power. Pressure makes diamonds, right? It\u2019s really beautiful to see her in the beginning kind of looking angelic, pure, and innocent and stepping into the world for the first time. Near the bridge where she comes through the doors with the smoke, she actually steps into her power and then she dances for life at the end. So there\u2019s a lot of messages of that and sometimes just in life where you\u2019re in that position where someone is challenging your power,\u201d Goebel said.\n\n\u201cAbracadabra\u201d is the third single from the Mayhem album. Supporters are anticipating that it will have Lady Gaga\u2019s iconic Fame Monster era written all over it.\n\n\u201cI heard the song a long time ago and was like \u2018this is a smash\u2019 so I was already really excited to create to this song for her,\u201d Goebel said in response to her approach for \u201cAbracadabra\u201d.\n\n\u201cI feel like I became a little kid again. My imagination just ran wild like storytime,\u201d Goebel said.\n\n\u201cChoreography is all about style, perspective, and storytelling, \u201c Goebel shared as advice for those looking to enter the contest and for aspiring choreographers.\n\n\u201cIf everyone is going right, go left. I think just doing your best to create your own language and figure out what makes you unique and just turn that up. Put a magnifying glass on it and make that your brand. Figure out what sets you apart and be confident in it whether people are watching you or not.\u201d\n\nMayhem is set to release on March 7.",

            "content": "Mastercard Inc. is a leading technology company in the payments industry that provides payment processing solutions to businesses and consumers worldwide. Mastercard is one of the largest payment processors in the world by market cap and the number of payments processed.\n\nMastercard was founded in 1966 as Master Charge: The Interbank Card. The company was created to respond to the growing need for a secure and reliable payment processing system. In 1979, the company changed its name to Mastercard. Mastercard is in over 200 countries and territories and serves over 2.8 billion cardholders.\n\nMastercard operates on a business-to-business (B2B) model, providing payment processing services to financial institutions, merchants and governments. The company earns revenue primarily through transaction processing fees, cross-border fees and other value-added services. Mastercard's business is divided into four segments: domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees, transaction processing fees and additional revenue.\n\nMastercard's financial performance has been consistently strong in recent years, with revenue and earnings growth driven by increased transaction volumes and higher fees. Mastercard faces significant competition from other payment processing companies, including Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) and PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL). However, Mastercard has maintained its position as one of the largest payment processors in the world due to its strong brand recognition, global network and innovative technology solutions.\n\nMastercard has consistently invested in innovative technology to enhance its payment processing solutions. One of the company's most significant innovations in recent years is Mastercard's tokenization technology, which provides a secure way to process payments without exposing cardholder data. Mastercard has also invested heavily in contactless payment technology, which has become increasingly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMastercard has a solid commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability. The company has set ambitious goals to reduce its carbon footprint, increase financial inclusion and promote gender equality. Mastercard is also actively involved in philanthropic efforts, including the Mastercard Foundation, which focuses on advancing financial inclusion in Africa.\n\nAs with any company, Mastercard faces several risk factors that could impact its financial performance. One of the most significant risks facing Mastercard is the potential for increased regulation of the payment processing industry. Mastercard is also vulnerable to changes in consumer behavior, such as a shift away from traditional payment methods toward mobile payments. Additionally, Mastercard's business depends on the overall health of the global economy, which could be impacted by factors such as inflation, geopolitical tensions and natural disasters.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other dividend growth stocks.\n\nDividend stocks faced a tough year in 2024 as investor focus largely moved toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks companies with a minimum of 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained just over 6% in 2024, falling well behind the broader market\u2019s nearly 25% return. This lagging performance isn\u2019t uncommon for dividend stocks, which often struggle to attract interest when more high-growth opportunities dominate the market. However, experienced investors may see the long-term value and stability that dividend stocks continue to offer.\n\nDividends have historically been a key component of total returns for US stocks, contributing nearly one-third of overall equity gains since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period characterized by declining interest rates, dividends accounted for 75% of the broader market\u2019s returns. In a low-rate environment, dividends become even more valuable by ensuring a steady income stream when fixed-income investments provide lower yields. Companies that introduce dividends rarely discontinue them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can make a stock more attractive to investors, potentially driving up its market value.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best Energy Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nA report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that over the past decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently grown at an average annual rate of just over 7%. In strong market conditions, dividends have helped enhance total returns, while in difficult years\u2014such as 2020 and 2022, when market returns were weak or negative\u2014they played a crucial role in stabilizing returns and strengthening portfolio resilience.\n\nDividend-paying stocks offer more than just regular payouts\u2014they often provide a defensive edge, making them valuable during periods when preserving wealth and maintaining steady income are priorities. A report by Eagle Asset Management examined instances where the broader market declined by at least 15% before recovering to its previous high. The study used three dividend-focused benchmarks to emphasize the importance of not only investing in dividend-yielding companies but also prioritizing those with a track record of consistently increasing payouts. The findings revealed that indexes composed of dividend-paying companies tend to outperform the broader market, particularly during prolonged downturns. This highlights the resilience and potential outperformance of dividend-focused investments during turbulent market conditions.\n\nDividends play a significant role in global equity markets, contributing approximately 34% of the MSCI World Index\u2019s annual returns since February 1, 1970. Historically, holding shares in companies committed to dividend growth has provided several advantages, including strong absolute returns and superior risk-adjusted performance across full market cycles. These investments have also demonstrated lower volatility compared to the broader MSCI World Index, offering a level of capital preservation even in challenging market environments. In addition, they provide a diversified income stream with the potential for both steady income growth and capital appreciation.\n\nWithin the dividend space, companies that regularly raise their payouts are more favored among investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend growth stocks with over 10% dividend growth rate.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz stock screener and picked dividend companies with positive dividend growth rates in the past five years. From that group, we picked 13 stocks that have raised their dividends at an annual average rate of over 10% in the past five years and ranked them according to their dividend growth rates. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey\u2019s database, as of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)\n\n5-Year Average Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 14.54%\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is an American credit card company, headquartered in New York. The company offers a wide range of payment processing and related services to its consumers. The company has earned investor trust thanks to its strong growth, significant competitive advantage, and resilience in tough economic conditions. It primarily earns revenue through swipe fees, collecting just over 2% per transaction from co-branded cards. This straightforward and reliable business model thrives in good times and protects the company from credit risks during economic downturns. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by nearly 23%.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) reported revenue of $7.5 billion, which showed a 14% growth from the same period last year. The company\u2019s net income for the quarter came in at $3.5 billion, up from $3 billion in the prior-year period. By December 31, 2024, the company had 3.5 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued to its customers.\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)\u2019s cash position also remained strong. The company ended the quarter with over $8.4 billion available in cash and cash equivalents and its total assets amounted to over $19.7 billion. In FY24, it generated $14.7 billion in operating cash flow, up from $12 billion in 2023. Due to this strong cash position, the company returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through dividends in 2024.\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), one of the best dividend stocks, has been growing its payouts for 13 consecutive years. In the past five years, it has raised its payouts at an annual average rate of 14.5%. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.76 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.54%, as of February 8.\n\nOverall MA ranks 6th on our list of the best dividend stocks with dividend growth rates. While we acknowledge the potential for MA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Learn More\n\nThe TJX Rewards\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae, issued by Synchrony Bank, can be a worthy sidekick for the deal-savvy shopper who hunts bargains at T.J. Maxx and its affiliated stores.\n\nTypically, general credit cards don\u2019t earn bonus rewards on purchases at discount outlets, so for T.J. Maxx loyalists who are already getting a marked-down price, this $0-annual-fee card is extra valuable.\n\nIt can be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted, but if you don\u2019t frequently shop under the TJX brand umbrella, you\u2019ll rack up rewards slowly and may find redemptions limiting.\n\nHere are five things to know about the card:\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip There's also a store-only version of this card. It offers some of the same perks, but can be used only at T.J. Maxx and its family of stores. This review focuses solely on the open-loop TJX Rewards\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae, which can be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted.\n\n1. T.J. Maxx loyalists can rake in rewards ...\n\nThe TJX Rewards\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae offers a high in-brand rewards rate whether you\u2019re shopping off the rack or on the web:\n\n5 points per $1 spent at stores in the TJX family (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Sierra Trading Post and Homesense).\n\n1 point per $1 on all other purchases.\n\nPoints are worth a penny each, but there's only one redemption option: For every 1,000 points earned, you\u2019ll get a $10 rewards certificate to spend on purchases in store or online at the above retailers. (Certificates can be issued in either $10 or $20 denominations.)\n\nIf you shop at T.J. Maxx at every opportunity, for all occasions \u2014 back to school, birthdays, holidays and such \u2014 you can score some serious points.\n\nTravel Rewards Expert Reveals... Why this is her top credit card for dining rewards, and she shows you exactly how she realizes more than $1,000 in value from it each year. Click for details\n\n2. ... But it's not ideal for everyday purchases\n\nOf course, you can't buy everything at T.J. Maxx. Your everyday spending on things like groceries, gas and restaurant meals will earn a paltry 1 point per $1, and you'll be locked in to using those rewards in only one place: within the T.J. Maxx family of brands.\n\nIf you're looking for more flexible earning and redemption options, a cash-back credit card will work better for you.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card, for example, offers 2% cash back on all purchases. That can add up much more quickly, and you can redeem your cash back as a qualifying bank account deposit, a statement credit or a check to use however you\u2019d like. The annual fee is $0.\n\nAnd, of course, you don't necessarily have to settle for just one card. You could use the TJX Rewards\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae on TJX purchases and the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card everywhere else.\n\n3. There's an upfront incentive, but it won't fund a shopping spree\n\nThe TJX Rewards\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae shaves 10% off your first purchase online or in store. That can make a decent dent in a big purchase, but a general rewards credit card may offer more valuable introductory incentives.\n\n4. You may get first dibs on merchandise ...\n\nThe TJX Rewards\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae snags you invitations to exclusive shopping events in store and online.\n\nYou can sort through the merchandise before other customers get access to it. Depending on the event, you might also snag some treats or prizes.\n\n5. ... But you won't want to carry a balance\n\nThere's no introductory APR period with this card, so if you need to finance a new wardrobe for work or some furniture for a remodel, you should probably look elsewhere.\n\nThe ongoing APR is 33.99%, Variable APR. Carrying a balance will chip away at any rewards you earn, so it's best to pay your balance on time and in full every month.\n\nIf you need breathing room on interest for a large purchase, a general rewards card with an introductory 0% APR period will be a better choice.",

            "content": "MasterCard (MA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this processor of debit and credit card payments have returned +9.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.9% change. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which MasterCard belongs, has gained 2.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, MasterCard is expected to post earnings of $3.59 per share, indicating a change of +8.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $15.98 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.5%. This estimate has changed -1.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.67 indicates a change of +16.9% from what MasterCard is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, MasterCard is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of MasterCard, the consensus sales estimate of $7.12 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.1%. The $31.55 billion and $35.5 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12% and +12.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMasterCard reported revenues of $7.49 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $3.82 for the same period compares with $3.18 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.38 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.44%. The EPS surprise was +3.8%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMasterCard is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about MasterCard. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren\u2019t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks\u2019 Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here\u2019s all you need to know.\n\nChanges are on the way for online shopping and e-commerce. The traditional way of paying for items online by typing in your credit card details (card number and CVV security code) will soon be a thing of the past.\n\nMastercard and other card payment companies will be introducing a one-click button that will work on any online platform.\n\nOne of the reasons why services will be moving to a one-click system is to deter hackers who target merchant sites to steal consumer card information. According to a 2023 study by Juniper Research, merchant losses from online payment fraud will exceed $362 billion globally between 2023 to 2028, with losses of $91 billion alone in 2028.\n\nThe one-click system will protect consumers and their online data.\n\nCard in the other room? With PayPal One-Touch\u2122, you can purchase anything you'd like with a single click\u2014no wallet necessary. #PayPalCanDoThat https://t.co/7pQISASVRf pic.twitter.com/uKzKnu70Ht \u2014 PayPal (@PayPal) May 16, 2018\n\nHow the one-click payment method works\n\nOne-click payment processes or single payments allows merchants to give their customers the option to pay for a product/service by clicking on a single button.\n\nThis is possible through a process called tokenization, which replaces your 16-to-19-digit card number with a randomly generated one. Your actual card information is never transmitted during the transaction, and if hackers steal your token in a data breach, it\u2019s basically worthless.\n\nMastercard developed the tokenization standard in 2013. It was then adopted as an industry standard by EMVCo, the consortium that manages payment standards globally. In 2014, Mastercard introduced its tokenization service, the Mastercard Digital Enablement Service, as part of the launch of Apple Pay.\n\nToday, a quarter of all Mastercard transactions globally are tokenized, and this is accelerating by 50% year over year, because it has proved effective in reducing e-commerce fraud. It reduces the security burden on merchants, payment service providers and banks, and increases confidence in the digital economy for everyone.\n\nTokenization is enabled by the issuing bank and requires no effort on the part of the consumer \u2014 and no need to reissue existing cards. In fact, tokenization even makes your automatic payments more seamless.\n\nThe key to the future of digital commerce? You. Visa Payment Passkey Service confirms \u2018you are you\u2019 by enabling you to use the biometrics you use to unlock your device for payment authentication. Step into the future: https://t.co/0aJ4WTyQj3 #VPF2024 pic.twitter.com/9r6KU0HDHI \u2014 VisaNews (@VisaNews) May 15, 2024\n\nExamples of tokenized transactions\n\nLet\u2019s say you make an online purchase from a store that you use regularly. The first transaction will require all of your payment details (first and last name of the cardholder, card number, CVV, expiration date). All of that information will be stored on the system so the next time you visit, it will recognize you as a returning customer.\n\nSubsequent transactions will be available through a one-click payment option, which the system processes by accessing the pre-stored customer info, to charge the cardholder.\n\nTokenization alone won\u2019t transform online checkout. It\u2019s only the first step. The next will be payment passkeys for online transactions, using the biometric authentication which many people have to log into their smartphone. Payment passkeys allow you to authenticate your online purchases using your fingerprint, face scan or PIN on your personal device.\n\nRelated stories\n\nGet your game on!

Banks are developing blockchain-based tokenized deposits to represent their banking deposits for faster transaction settlement processes.\n\nThe market acceptance of stablecoins, which maintain their value through ties to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, continues to rise for business payments and remittances. Both innovations will become more secure under new regulatory rules, which will drive additional market participants to join.\n\nUnder President Trump, the United States has adopted a more active stance regarding regulatory changes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formed a crypto task force to create new policies, and the European Union already possesses a complete regulatory structure.\n\nThe emerging regulatory clarity will motivate financial institutions to test digital assets, which will drive innovation together with maintaining control over malicious actors.\n\nCentral banks worldwide are no longer pursuing the development of digital currencies for public use. Financial institutions receive priority from central banks, who develop digital assets to enhance their settlement capabilities and expedite cross-border financial operations.\n\nBlockchain networks will experience increased interoperability and trust as time goes by. The Multi-Token Network (MTN) by Mastercard has created secure interoperable transaction capabilities that will fuel future crypto and financial industry development in 2025.\n\nThe integration of crypto into traditional finance will reach new heights during the upcoming year of 2025.",

            "content": "Over the years, Mastercard (MA 1.23%) has done nothing but reward its investors. Since the company's initial public offering (IPO) in May 2006, shares have skyrocketed, rising 12,160% (as of Feb. 3). A $1,000 investment would be worth $122,600 today.\n\nThat gain is hard to overstate. Even these days, Mastercard continues to put up strong financial results. For prospective investors, is this top financial stock still a buy?\n\nGrowing the top and bottom line\n\nInvestors will appreciate Mastercard's ability to steadily grow. The prevalence of cashless transactions, at the expense of using physical cash, benefits the business. In the U.S., about half of Americans still use cash for some or all of their weekly purchases. This data shows that there is still a sizable runway for Mastercard, even in a very developed economy that has a robust payments and financial services infrastructure.\n\nThis has resulted in revenue growth of nearly 200% between 2014 and 2024. During that decade, the business only registered one down year, which was in 2020 due to the pandemic. Mastercard gets a lift from more payment volume and active cards over time.\n\nThat sales trajectory has resulted in impressive bottom-line gains as well. Mastercard's diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose 17% in 2024. In the past 10 years, it has increased at a compound annual rate of 16.2%. This trend is precisely what has supported the stock's climb.\n\nMastercard's positive traits\n\nThe company's profitability is outstanding. In fact, this is one of the most financially lucrative enterprises in the world. Last year, Mastercard generated net income of $12.9 billion. That translated to a fantastic profit margin of 45.7%.\n\nThis allowed the business to report stellar free cash flow to the tune of $13.6 billion in 2024. Mastercard operates an asset-light model that doesn't require a lot of capital expenditures to grow. The communications protocol that connects merchants, consumers, and financial institutions is already largely built out. Every additional transaction that runs through the protocol carries a high return on invested capital.\n\nSupporting Mastercard's economic moat is the presence of network effects. There are 3.5 billion cards in use across the globe that are accepted at 130 million merchant locations. More cards equal greater value to merchants looking to target a wide customer base and grow their sales. And more acceptance locations means that consumers have more places to spend. The bigger the network becomes, the more useful it is to everyone.\n\nI'd argue that Mastercard's competitive position is virtually unassailable despite the top fear many shareholders might have of ongoing regulatory risks. The payments platform is critical to the smooth functioning of our economy. And it provides a safe, convenient, and fast way to handle transactions. That setup is hard to disrupt.\n\nIs valuation important?\n\nIn the past decade, Mastercard shares have traded at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37.9. That's not a shocker. This is an outstanding company, so it generally sells for a premium valuation. For comparison's sake, the S&P 500 trades at a P/E multiple of 25.5. As of this writing, Mastercard is 7% more expensive than its trailing-10-year average.\n\nAccording to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Mastercard's EPS is projected to increase at an annualized rate of 14.1% between 2024 and 2027. That outlook is reasonable, in my opinion, given that it's in line with the company's past averages.\n\nBut does that growth forecast warrant paying almost 40 times earnings for Mastercard? I don't think so. Investors looking to score market-beating gains might want to wait for a better valuation before buying the stock.",

            "content": "Instant gratification rules today\u2019s theater of commerce, and businesses shouldn\u2019t be letting fraud get in the way by slowing down transactions.\n\nFrom seamless tap-to-pay interactions at local coffee shops to online checkouts that rival the brevity of a haiku, immediacy has worked to position itself as the defining KPI of both payments and the customer experience. Yet, with great speed can often come significant vulnerability.\n\nTo unpack the realities of the contemporary landscape where convenience, speed and security often dictate consumer expectations, PYMNTS sat down with Adam Lowe, PhD, chief product and innovation officer at Arculus/CompoSecure; Rohit Chauhan, EVP, AI Fraud Solutions at Mastercard; and Chris Ward, head of enterprise payments at Truist to understand the strategies and opportunities businesses have as they race to both create seamless payment experiences and defend against what\u2019s next in fraud.\n\nOne exciting solution? Lowe said Arculus by CompoSecure\u2019s tap-to-authenticate metal payment cards could serve as a way to offer secure, streamlined and accessible physical authentication solutions, alleviating two issues at once by enabling a use-case experience with less friction and higher security.\n\n\u201cConsumers today operate in what I call the three S\u2019s of the economy: speed, simplicity, and safety,\u201d Truist\u2019s Ward added. \u201cPeople want to transact quickly and simply, and they need confirmation that the transaction was completed.\u201d\n\nSafety remains paramount, and Ward noted that \u201cconsumers don\u2019t mind friction if it protects them. Friction without protection, however, becomes a frustration point.\u201d\n\nMastercard\u2019s Chauhan echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that security and convenience are two sides of the same coin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balancing act,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is to keep friction as low as possible while maintaining the highest levels of security.\u201d\n\nWalking the Line Between Security and Experience\n\nWhile fraud prevention fuels boardroom conversations, the consumer\u2019s priority is simplicity. A cumbersome checkout process is anathema in the age of digital ease.\n\nThe crux of the challenge lies in harmonizing speed, security and user experience. Overzealous security protocols risk alienating consumers with excessive friction, while lax measures invite significant exposure to fraud. The equilibrium demands an intricate blend of technology and trust.\n\n\u201cCustomers are OK with friction if it provides value,\u201d CompoSecure\u2019s Lowe said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to carry another widget or learn something new; they want to use what they already know \u2026 we\u2019re typically known for our premium metal cards, and we\u2019ve taught the world how to tap to pay so extending that to tap-to-authenticate is a logical step.\u201d\n\nThis principle extends to technological innovations like device-bound passkeys, which Lowe championed as a game-changer.\n\n\u201cPasskeys eliminate the guesswork,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re injected into one device and accessed only from that device, offering a high degree of authenticity with minimal user effort.\u201d\n\nAs innovation marches onward, payments ecosystems are transitioning from reactive risk mitigation to proactive fraud prevention \u2014 a transformation akin to going from installing locks post-break-in to designing a house impervious to intrusion.\n\nSeamless Payments for a Frictionless Future\n\nFraudsters, however, are not static entities. They\u2019re evolving with equal sophistication. From synthetic identity fraud to advanced phishing schemes, their playbook is growing exponentially nuanced thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the increasing accessibility of cloud computing.\n\nThese compounding advances have lowered the barriers for bad actors, creating what Mastercard\u2019s Chauhan called \u201casymmetric warfare.\u201d \u201cFor fraudsters to win, they only need one transaction to succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cFor financial institutions and networks to win, we need to stop them all. Fraudsters\u2019 cost of launching attacks is near zero, thanks to open-source AI tools.\u201d\n\nStill, Chauhan highlighted advances in AI, particularly Mastercard\u2019s Decision Intelligence product, which scores over a billion transactions in less than 50 milliseconds. \u201cAs technology evolves, so does our ability to detect and prevent fraud,\u201d he said.\n\nTruist\u2019s Ward noted that consumer education remains a critical, yet challenging, aspect of fraud prevention. \u201cIf a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cBusinesses and consumers alike need to be vigilant, especially when transacting with unknown entities or offers that appear overly enticing.\u201d\n\nLowe emphasized the importance of industry-wide adoption of security standards, like passkeys.\n\n\u201cIn the same way that I trust physical keys to the physical lock on my home, I trust digital keys for my digital life. You either have it or you don\u2019t. Everyone is standardizing around the passkey technologies adopted by Microsoft, Google, Meta, and this unified approach strengthens the entire ecosystem and makes it exponentially harder for fraudsters to succeed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m most excited about device-bound passkeys, whether that be bound into a card or a phone,\u201d Lowe added. \u201cThe most important thing is that the passkey is not synced to the cloud \u2026 it does some interesting things around turning card-not-present transactions into card-present transactions, because you have a signature proving you have possession of that card \u2026 forming that ecosystem, which is very low friction, yet very high yield in terms of authenticity, is extremely valuable.\u201d\n\nUltimately, achieving the right balance between security and user experience often involves a combination of technology, education and collaboration. At the end of the day, it\u2019s about keeping customers safe and happy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about deploying new tools,\u201d Ward said. \u201cIt\u2019s about designing them in a way that integrates speed and simplicity without sacrificing security.\u201d\n\n\u201cAI is not a silver bullet, but it\u2019s an essential component of a multi-layered defense strategy,\u201d Chauhan said.",

It wasn't a cash-back card. Instead, it earned 3 points per $1 on gas and at restaurants, 2 points per $1 on PayPal and eBay purchases, and 1 point per $1 on everything else.

The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nIf you want a simple, steady, straightforward rewards rate without having to think about where and when to use your card, the PayPal Cashback Mastercard\u00ae earns 3% cash back when you pay with PayPal at checkout, and 1.5% back on all other purchases. That makes it an OK but not spectacular all-around choice if you only want to manage one card, especially if you pay through PayPal often. It could also make it a fitting companion for another card that earns higher rewards in specific spending categories.\n\nThis card periodically offers sign-up bonuses for a limited time. If you didn\u2019t get the card when a bonus was available, keep in mind that a card earning 1.5% back, with a bonus, may be a better deal for you, depending on your spending.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip In May 2024, the cash back rate on the PayPal Cashback Mastercard\u00ae was decreased from 2% to 1.5% on purchases made outside of PayPal.\n\nDon\u2019t want to create a PayPal account?\n\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card earns 2% cash back on all purchases.

The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nThe Venmo Credit Card features bonus spending categories that automatically readjust each billing cycle based on where you spend the most, which makes it easy to maximize your earnings with minimal effort. You\u2019ll earn 3% cash back in your top spending category (from one of eight possible categories), 2% back in your second-highest category and 1% on all other purchases. There\u2019s no need to activate bonus categories or track anything. The ability to earn bonus rewards could make it more lucrative than the PayPal Cashback Mastercard\u00ae if you don\u2019t use PayPal at checkout very often.\n\nThe card is built for on-the-go management and cost-splitting. You can track your spending and pay your credit card bill through the Venmo app. You can also split an expense with friends \u2014 simply pay, and then your friends can scan the QR code on your card. Your account will pop up on their phone and they\u2019ll be able to send you money. (You also scan your own QR code to activate the card.) Plus, you have instant access to a virtual card upon application approval while you wait for the physical card to arrive.\n\nDon\u2019t want to create a Venmo account?\n\nThe Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express earns extra rewards in popular spending categories: 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets on up to $6,000 in spending per year (then 1%), 6% back on select U.S. streaming services; 3% back on eligible transit and at U.S. gas stations; and 1% everywhere else.* Terms apply (see rates and fees). It comes with a fee, currently: $0 intro annual fee for the first year, then $95. But the card\u2019s welcome bonus offer helps offset the cost.\n\nThe case for carrying both cards\n\nA flat-rate card plus a bonus-category card is a classic credit card pairing that makes it possible to earn more on every purchase, but it does take some work. In the case of these two cards, you\u2019d need to anticipate where you\u2019d spend the most (within the eight specific categories) in a month and use the Venmo Credit Card for those purchases, and then use the PayPal Cashback Mastercard\u00ae anywhere the Venmo Credit Card would only earn 1% back, thus earning at least 1.5% back every time.\n\nHere\u2019s how that could work: You\u2019re booking a pricey trip this month, so travel would be your No. 1 category. Use the Venmo Credit Card to earn 3% back. If you know offhand what your second-highest category would be, you could use the card on those purchases, too, and earn 2% cash back. Since the PayPal Cashback Mastercard\u00ae earns at least 1.5% on everything else, you can just use that for any additional spending outside of travel and your second-highest category. Ta-da! Everything you buy earns 1.5% to 3% cash back.\n\n*Cash Back is received in the form of Reward Dollars that can be redeemed as a statement credit or at Amazon.com checkout.",

That\u2019s more expensive than even The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express, which is $695 annually (rates & fees) and one-fifth the price of the exclusive (and elusive) Centurion\u00ae Card from American Express, which is said to have a $5,000 yearly fee.\n\nWith those details in mind, let\u2019s take a look at how much a Luxury Card will cost you yearly, depending on which card you choose:\n\nMastercard Gold Card: $995 annual fee ($295 for each authorized user)\n\nMastercard Black Card: $495 annual fee ($195 for each authorized user)\n\nMastercard Titanium Card: $195 annual fee ($95 for each authorized user)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarning and Redeeming Points With Luxury Card\n\nDining out with all Luxury Card options earns 1x points for every $1 spent. Image Credit: Luxury Card\n\nLuxury Card offers many of the benefits that premium cards, such as The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express, Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae, and Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, provide. Where it falls short, however, is in its earning structure.\n\nRegardless of which Luxury Card you select, you\u2019ll earn 1x points for every $1 you spend. That\u2019s a pretty low bonus rate, especially when considering other premium cards:\n\nAmex Platinum Card: 5x points on flights booked directly with airlines or with AmexTravel.com (up to $500,000 spent per year, then 1x) and prepaid hotels through AmexTravel.com\n\n5x points on flights booked directly with airlines or with AmexTravel.com (up to $500,000 spent per year, then 1x) and prepaid hotels through AmexTravel.com Chase Sapphire Reserve Card : 5x points on airfare booked via the Chase Travel portal; 3x points on all other travel and dining purchases\n\n: 5x points on airfare booked via the Chase Travel portal; 3x points on all other travel and dining purchases Capital One Venture X Card: 5x on travel bookings made through Capital One Travel and 2x on all other eligible purchases\n\nLuxury Card offers 2% value for airfare redemptions \u2013 meaning 50,000 points will get you a $1,000 airline ticket. That comes to a value of 2 cents per point, similar to our valuations for other flexible loyalty programs. However, other programs like Amex Membership Rewards or Chase Ultimate Rewards allow you to transfer flexible points to travel partners to book business or first class award travel or luxury hotel stays. In some instances, you can get a redemption value of up to 10 cents per point with these partners.\n\nIf you prefer to redeem Luxury Card points for cash, you\u2019ll receive a value of up to 2% cash-back \u2014 1% for the Mastercard Titanium card, 1.5% for the Mastercard Black card, and 2% for the Mastercard Gold card. This can either be deposited into your bank account or used as a statement credit. But unlike other cards, you can\u2019t turn the cash-back into transferable rewards because Luxury Card has no transfer partners.\n\nLuxury Card Benefits\n\nNow let\u2019s take an in-depth look at the benefits you\u2019ll receive with each card:\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE Mastercard Gold Card Mastercard Black Card Mastercard Titanium Card Annual Fee $995 $495 $195 Earning Potential Earn 1x points for every $1 you spend Value for Airfare Redemptions 2% Value for Cash-Back Redemptions 2% 1.5% 1% Annual Airline Credit Toward Qualifying Airline Purchases $200 $100 N/A Global Entry Application Fee Credit $120 N/A Priority Pass Select Membership $100 N/A\n\nBottom Line: As you\u2019ll see, there\u2019s virtually no difference between the Mastercard Gold card and the Mastercard Black card. The latter offers 1.5% cash-back instead of 2%. But the perks significantly roll back if you have the Mastercard Titanium card, which offers virtually no travel benefits outside of cash-back or airfare redemptions.\n\nTravel Benefits\n\nWith Luxury Card, you find some of the same benefits as other premium cards. Here are some of the benefits you could be eligible for after opening a Luxury Card:\n\nAnnual Airline Credit\n\nMastercard Gold cardholders receive up to $200 in annual air travel credit toward flight-related purchases, including airline tickets, baggage fees, and upgrades, while Mastercard Black cardholders receive up to $100 in annual air travel credit. This credit is automatically applied to your account.\n\nGlobal Entry and TSA PreCheck\n\nTwo of the Luxury Card products offer TSA PreCheck benefits. Image Credit: Myrtle Beach International Airport\n\nMastercard Black card and Mastercard Gold cards receive up to $120 statement credit towards a TSA PreCheck or Global Entry membership. A Global Entry membership gets you expedited arrival into the U.S. from international destinations. Enrolled Global Entry members will also have TSA PreCheck.\n\nPriority Pass Select Membership\n\nSimilar to other high-end credit cards, you\u2019ll get complimentary access to 1,500+ airport lounges around the world with Priority Pass Select if you have a Mastercard Gold card or Mastercard Black card.\n\nRental Car Coverage\n\nAll cards come with secondary coverage for damages to an eligible rental vehicle when you pay for the entire rental transaction using your card and decline the coverage offered by the rental agency.\n\nOther Travel Benefits\n\nAll 3 cards come with the following additional travel benefits:\n\nAirport Meet and Assis t: Trained agents can accompany you through the airport, bypassing crowds and speeding up formalities.

Make sure to check out mastercard.us/worldeliteoffers to see other offers.\n\nIs Luxury Card Worth It?\n\nPeople looking for a statement card \u2014 that is, a card that will draw eyes when thrown down at the dinner table \u2014 may enjoy this card. Luxury Card offers some decent benefits, but the annual fees, especially for the Mastercard Black card and Mastercard Gold card, will be a hard pill to swallow for many travelers.\n\nThere are some decent benefits, like the travel concierge and Luxury Card Travel program, that can get you discounted rates and benefits at thousands of properties. Similar benefits come with other premium cards, but it\u2019s nice to see a new player offer similar perks.\n\nOne of the most significant offsets to having a high-annual-fee premium card is being able to transfer those points \u2014 be it Amex, Capital One, Chase, or Citi \u2014 to an airline or hotel partner, which can give you outsized value. Unlike other premium credit cards, Luxury Card doesn\u2019t partner with hotel or airline loyalty programs, which means you won\u2019t be able to earn points through the program and then transfer them to a partner. And while you can redeem points earned from the cards for airfare, it doesn\u2019t appear that you\u2019re able to do the same for hotel stays, which is something that many high-end credit cards offer.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, you won\u2019t receive any hotel elite status with Luxury Card like you would when holding the Amex Business Platinum card or Amex Platinum card, both of which offer complimentary Hilton and Marriott elite status (enrollment required).\n\nYou do have access to the Priority Pass network and TSA PreCheck or Global Entry statement credits with the Mastercard Gold card and Mastercard Black card, but again, these are perks that come standard with many premium travel rewards cards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuxury Card Alternatives\n\nIf you decide against Luxury Card \u2014 or decide that you want several premium cards in your wallet \u2014 there are several alternatives offering immeasurable benefits. Let\u2019s take a look at a few:\n\nHot Tip: Check out our detailed comparison of the Mastercard Black card vs. the Amex Platinum card.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nLuxury Card makes sense if you want a cool credit card that will make your friends\u2019 eyes go wide. But that\u2019s pretty much where the draw ends. It has some decent benefits like a travel concierge and travel discounts. Still, the high annual fee on the premium cards and the limited benefits on the lower-tier card makes it difficult to justify opening it.",

Studies indicate that merchants lose more than 4.6% of their e-commerce revenue to payment fraud in the region, with overall fraud attempts surging by 32% in Latin America in 2024 versus the previous year \u2013 the largest increase of any region.\n\nMastercard Payment Passkey Service boosts the security and convenience of online transactions by using device-based biometrics, such as fingerprints and facial recognition already available on smartphones, to authenticate purchases. This replaces traditional authentication methods, such as one-time passwords (OTPs), which have become increasingly vulnerable to online scams like phishing, SIM swapping, and message interception. The service also leverages advanced tokenization technology to ensure that sensitive data is never shared with third parties and remains useless to fraudsters in the event of a data breach, making transactions even more secure.\n\nJames Stack, Head of Product at Yuno, commented:\n\n\u201cMastercard Payment Passkey Service is a major leap forward in online transaction security. By leveraging advanced tokenization and biometric authentication, it significantly reduces the risk of fraud and protects sensitive data from cyber threats. As the leading provider of Mastercard Click to Pay technology in Latin America, we\u2019re proud to offer merchants a solution that not only streamlines the checkout process but also ensures the highest level of security for both businesses and customers in a region where fraud has been a persistent challenge.\u201d\n\nSilvana Hernandez, Executive Vice President, Core Products, Mastercard, Latin America and the Caribbean, added:\n\n\u201cMastercard is committed to bringing convenience and security to the payment experience. The enablement of Mastercard Payment Passkey through our partnership with Yuno is an important step towards the advancement of digital payments in Latin America and the Caribbean.\u201d\n\nMastercard Payment Passkey Service strengthens the company\u2019s existing Click to Pay solution, which was introduced to Yuno-enabled merchants in November and seeks to make the checkout process simpler and more seamless for customers by removing the need for manual entry of card details. Functioning much like a digital wallet, Mastercard\u2019s Click to Pay solution enables shoppers to pay with ease in just a single click.\n\nIn addition to Mastercard Click to Pay with Passkey service, Yuno\u2019s platform also offers merchants quick access to over 1000 different global payment methods, proprietary smart routing technology and end-to-end payment orchestration, rendering it a one-stop shop for all merchant\u2019s payment needs.

And while all eyes were on Washington with the U.S. inauguration, the discussions on the ground emphasized the need to drive forward digital transformation \u2014 from agentic AI to blockchain to the commercialization of these technologies \u2014 that benefits everyone.\n\nMcLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown, center, is flanked by Raja Rajamannar, left, Mastercard chief marketing and communications officer, and Jorn Lambert, right, Mastercard chief product officer, who co-hosted a Davos roundtable on how passion, data-driven insights and a high-performance mindset can drive growth in the intelligent age.\n\n\u201cIn a day and age where you\u2019ve got ... a disaggregated world, you want something that protects you,\u201d said Jon Huntsman, Mastercard\u2019s president of Strategic Growth, at a panel on stemming financial fragmentation. \u201cWe have spent a lot of money on consumer protection, on cyber, on tokenization \u2026 that allows us to gain critical insights and intelligence on who\u2019s got your information, who might be a bad actor, and how to avoid that.\u201d\n\nAI remains atop the agenda\n\nArtificial intelligence continued to dominate discussions \u2014 both its \u201cstunning technology possibility,\u201d in the words of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and the \u201cepic challenge\u201d it poses for governments all over the world. Leaders discussed a number of those challenges they needed to address, including how they could meet the demands for energy and computer chips that heavy use of AI requires.\n\nMastercard Chief Sustainability Officer Ellen Jackowski hosted a session on the circular economy in the intelligent age. \"From creating new logistics and transaction infrastructures to enabling more conscious consumer choices, digital transformation is key to making low-carbon choices scalable,\" she said. \"The power of data and the intelligent age are opening new opportunities to reduce waste, optimize resources, and capture value back into companies\u2019 supply chains.\"\n\nAdditionally, they\u2019ll have to confront a potential \u201ccrisis of truth\u201d that AI could exacerbate, as Pope Francis characterized it in a written address, and find ways to upskill employees for the age of AI \u2014 even as a WEF survey earlier this month revealed that 41% of employers globally plan to downsize their workforce by 2030 due to AI automation. In fact, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said that the chief executives gathered in this Swiss village would be the last generation to manage all-human workforces.\n\nMastercard Board of Directors Chair Merit Janow, center, and Linda Kirkpatrick, right, Mastercard Americas president, with members of the World Economic Forum's Young Global Leaders program, including Mastercard's Stefany Bello, third from right, which works to shape a more inclusive and sustainable future.\n\nEven as participants discussed the big issues of the day, they didn\u2019t lose sight of the little things that are foundational to digital alignment and collaboration. Described by one participant as \u201cinspired dullness,\u201d a continued drive towards common standards came up frequently.\n\nLing Hai, Mastercard president for Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, addressed the need to accelerate digitization and access to finance for small businesses in an article for the WEF's website last week: \"By helping small businesses accelerate their digital journeys, it has a multiplier effect in building much wider access to the digital economy.\"\n\nFor small businesses, AI could be a gamechanger, but panelists acknowledged there are challenges in bringing those benefits to resource-strapped entrepreneurs. \u201cThere's mistrust around technology. There's time poverty. There's a sense of overload in terms of where to start,\u201d says Payal Dalal, an executive vice president for global programs at the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, at a panel hosted by the Center on driving resilience for small businesses in an AI-driven world.\n\nRaja Rajammanar spoke with McLaren Racing Formula 1 Team driver Lando Norris on how Norris managed pressure, what he's hoping to accomplish this year, and his passions off the track, including esports, golf and photography. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing that always motivating \u2013 the fans who are there to support you and cheer you on, because they\u2019re also on the journey with you,\" Norris said.\n\n\u201cAnd finally,\u201d she continued, \u201csmall businesses don't know how AI can really help them save time and make money. So really understanding what the needs of the small businesses are and then figuring out how AI can help as opposed to just pushing AI towards small businesses is the way forward.\u201d\n\nAnd in a piece for the WEF Agenda blog published as the summit opened, Ling Hai, Mastercard\u2019s president for Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, highlighted how partnerships across the public sector, nonprofit and private sector are essential to accelerating the digital journeys of small businesses, which can boost economies and drive greater inclusion and resilience.\n\nTrust must be foundational\n\nIn addition to AI, the rise of cybersecurity risks was a major topic of discussion at WEF this year. As attacks are growing in scope and scale, small businesses need help, Ling Hai wrote. \u201cGiven the pressures of running a small business, it is impossible to expect owners to keep track of the latest updates or research the best network monitoring software, but trust with customers that has taken years to build can be shattered in seconds by a cybersecurity breach.\u201d\n\nA new report by WEF released earlier in January on the state of cybersecurity pointed to the growing complexity of cyberspace, which is widening the opportunity gap between large and small organizations, and deepening the economic divide between developed and emerging economies.\n\nCollaborative action, particularly between the private and public sector, is needed to ensure \u201cwe can bring innovation and data in the context of AI along, so that we can ensure that the Global South is well protected for future generations,\u201d said Kiki Del Valle, Mastercard division president for North Latin America at a panel convened by ODI and Mastercard on leadership in an era of weakened multilateralism.\n\nJon Huntsman, left, Mastercard president of Strategic Growth, joined a panel on stemming financial fragmentation that included Paul Chan Mo-po, financial secretary of Hong Kong, right. Huntsman emphasized the importance of consumer protections in a rapidly developing threat landscape and, as the world has become disaggregated, the need to work with regional partners and regulators.\n\nAnother worrying finding of the survey: About 35% of small organizations believe their cyber resilience is inadequate, a proportion that has increased sevenfold since 2022. Meanwhile, many more large organizations are reporting that they believe they have enough cyber protections.\n\nPayal Dalal, left, the executive vice president of global programs at the Center for Inclusive Growth at Mastercard, spoke with Sarah Backhouse, right, an executive director at World50 Group, on how AI can help empower underserved communities worldwide.\n\n\u201cSafety and security, right now, is one of the biggest threats that face us globally,\u201d said Linda Kirkpatrick, Mastercard\u2019s Americas president, who joined a panel on the WEF mainstage on the future of the economy in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n\u201cOne positive outcome of the pandemic was that our small businesses, our consumers, got comfortable in a digitized environment,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want everyone to have access, and we want access to drive usage. At the same time, that advancement in digitization can lead to risk in the system in the form of cyberattacks. Safety and security, right now, is one of the biggest threats that face us globally. We need to unify around a common goal to protect our digital ecosystem.\"\n\nOriginally published by Mastercard\n\nFollow along Mastercard's journey to connect and power an inclusive, digital economy that benefits everyone, everywhere.",

This white paper explores how PFaaS is reshaping the payments landscape, offering new opportunities for acquirers, payment facilitators and independent software vendors, or ISVs.\n\nPFaaS platforms are not just a trend but a fundamental shift in how the payment industry operates. They push traditional payment processors to innovate, enhance the merchant experience and empower ISVs to become key players in the payment ecosystem. As the technology matures and adoption increases, PFaaS is poised to play a central role in shaping the future of digital payments and embedded finance.\n\nAmong the key findings of the white paper:\n\n\u2022 PFaaS simplifies the complex process of becoming a PayFac, allowing ISVs to quickly and cost-effectively offer integrated payment solutions.\n\n\u2022 This approach can collapse the time to market for new PayFacs from months to weeks and significantly reduce merchant onboarding time from weeks to minutes, enhancing user experience and accelerating platform time-to-revenue.\n\n\u2022 The market for PFaaS is growing rapidly, with several key players emerging and offering increasingly sophisticated solutions.\n\n\u2022 PFaaS platforms include capabilities to handle the regulatory compliance and risk management burden, lowering the risk for new PayFacs and their sponsor acquirers.\n\n\u2022 The future for PFaaS looks promising, with predictions of continued growth of the PayFac model, hundreds of new PayFac formations a quarter, their expansion into new verticals, and further innovation in risk assessment and fraud prevention.",

            "content": "Carnival Cruise Line has no shortage of impressive destinations \u2014 from the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Caribbean and the Mexican Riviera, to locales much farther from home like Europe, Australia, New Zealand and more.\n\nAnd if you're planning to take to the seas with this cruise line, the $0-annual-fee Carnival World Mastercard can definitely defray some of your costs. Issued by Barclays, it offers modest introductory offers, and Carnival super cruisers in particular may enjoy the card's discounts on shore excursions.\n\nStill, most customers may be better off with a general travel card since the Carnival World Mastercard suffers from some of the same drawbacks that other cruise line credit cards have:\n\nModest ongoing rewards, which means it'll take you a while to accrue a pile of points on your everyday spending.\n\nComplex redemption tiers, which make it difficult to determine the value of those points.\n\nHere are five things to know about the Carnival World Mastercard.\n\n1. Its introductory offers are average\n\nNew cardholders will qualify for the following offers:\n\nA small sign-up bonus\n\nAs of May 2024, the Carnival World Mastercard offers 25,000 FunPoints after spending $500 within the first 90 days. This is a solid bonus, but there are plenty of other travel credit cards with more lucrative bonuses that can help cover some of your vacation costs.\n\nA lengthy 0% intro APR on balance transfers\n\nNew cardholders get a 0% introductory APR on the first 15 billing cycles following each balance transfer that posts to the account within 45 days of opening it. (It does charge a balance transfer fee of $ 5 or 5%, whichever is greater.)\n\nWhile this introductory offer is a good deal for a travel card, if getting out of debt is the goal \u2014 other balance transfer credit cards can offer a longer interest-free window. Plus, it's generally not advisable to charge large purchases, like travel, on a balance transfer card if your main objective is to get out of debt.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The Carnival World Mastercard also offers an APR promotion on purchases, but as of April 2023 it was on only \"qualifying Carnival cruise booking purchases,\" and for only six billing cycles. Otherwise, the ongoing APR varies depending on your credit but can range well above 20%.\n\n2. ... But ongoing rewards fall short\n\nBeyond the introductory offers, the Carnival World Mastercard offers mediocre rewards. You'll earn:\n\n2 FunPoints for every $1 spent on purchases made with Carnival Cruise Line and other eligible brands under the World\u2019s Leading Cruise Lines umbrella (including AIDA, Costa, Cunard, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises, P&O Cruises Australia, P&O Cruises UK, Seabourn and Fathom. These brands are accurate as of May 2024.) Terms apply.\n\n1 FunPoint per $1 spent on all other purchases.\n\nUnless you\u2019re frequently setting sail with qualifying cruise lines, it will take you a while to rack up points. Other no-annual-fee travel credit cards earn bonus rewards in everyday spending categories \u2014 like dining or groceries \u2014 or they may simply offer a high flat rate, like 1.5% back on purchases of any kind.\n\n3. Point values vary and redemption is needlessly complex\n\nYou can redeem FunPoints for statement credits toward a variety of purchases, though you'll potentially get the most value for them when you redeem them as credits to offset eligible Carnival purchases.\n\nBut here's the rub: When using your points this way, their value depends on the amount of the purchase. You'll need a minimum of 5,000 points to start, but here's what you can expect them to be worth in a statement credit:\n\nSpend $50 to $1,499.99: Statement credit redemption value of 1%.\n\nSpend $1,500 to $5,000: Statement credit redemption value of 1.5%.\n\nThe card's terms note that if you don't have enough points to redeem for the full purchase amount, you'll be able to redeem only in $50 statement credit increments between $50 and $5,000.\n\nPoint values also differ for other redemption options:\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nSpending on other World\u2019s Leading Cruise Lines brands: Statement credit redemption value of 1%.\n\nSpending on merchandise or onboard amenities: Statement credit redemption value will vary. (For these options, the minimum amount of points required to redeem may vary.)\n\nSpending on eligible airline or hotel purchases: Statement credit redemption value of 0.9%.\n\nSpending on gift cards: Statement credit redemption generally has a value of about 0.75%. (For these options, you'll need a minimum of 3,300 points, redeemable for $25.)\n\nA general travel credit \u2014 one that's not tied to any specific brand \u2014 will be much more straightforward and flexible. One example is the $0-annual-fee Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card. It earns 3 points per dollar on travel booked through Bank of America\u00ae and 1.5 points per $1 spent on other purchases, and those points are worth 1 cent each when redeemed for travel \u2014 but not just with cruise lines. You can redeem them for purchases with airlines, travel agencies, trains, buses, taxis, boat rentals, tourist attractions and exhibits, to name a few.\n\n4. It offers a 10% discount on shore excursions\n\nYou can qualify for a 10% discount in the form of a statement credit when you use the card to purchase a Carnival shore excursions package before your cruise.\n\nShore excursions are activities or tours that you can participate in as you explore a new destination. Taxes and fees are not included in the discount.\n\n5. It's relatively fee-friendly\n\nWith the Carnival World Mastercard, you don\u2019t have to worry about an annual fee or foreign transaction fees when you make a purchase abroad. (Some cards charge 1% to 3% for each international transaction.)",

            "content": "Visa, Mastercard, and Amex process about $26 trillion in transaction volume each year. For those of you wondering, if you stacked $26 trillion worth of $100 bills they would measure about 17,268 miles high. And while that still gives most of us zero context, if you stacked those hundred dollar bills and took them on a trip, they would make it three quarters of the way around the circumference of the world, an insane distace to think about.\n\nIf you\u2019re newer to the card space, this article is for you. And because I\u2019m incapable of writing research report style dissertations, here you get a to the point narrative on the big three card companies.\n\nWho Are They Really?\n\nThink of Visa as old reliable. The biggest & most boring. Built for scale. Catering to everyone from casual debit card users to global corporations. They process about $14.5 trillion in total payments volume annually. That\u2019s a lot.\n\nMastercard on the other hand is a bit craftier. Faster. More flexible. Trying to innovate. And leaning harder into tech, B2B, and cross border transactions (aka travelers). They do about $9.5 trillion in total payments volume annually.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Amex. The slightly snooty, exclusive, high-touch, and status symbol card. It caters to affluent consumers and business owners. Top tier rewards and premium service. They do about $1.8 trillion in total payments volume annually.\n\nSo each service slightly different customers, but another difference is that Amex actually holds credit risk, lending money like a bank and some of the other card companies.\n\nVisa and Mastercard don\u2019t. They are more like the toll booths collecting pennies on each transaction they process. The only thing they want is, you guessed it, more car traffic. If no one is on the road, they don\u2019t make money.\n\nWe\u2019re All Just Cyclical.\n\nAll companies are cylical to some extent. Almost all at least.\n\nIf I had to give you a spectrum of cylicality, card and payment companies in general would probably sit somewhere in the middle of the spectrum\n\nThey\u2019re not staples (like P&G or Walmart) or utilities that are fairly recession proof. Nor are they healthcare, which still gets used whether times are booming or not.\n\nAt the far other end of the spectrum they\u2019re not retail or travel (American Airlines, Hilton) which are super sensitive to the economic cycle and how much extra cash is in the consumers pockets.\n\nSo I\u2019d put Visa & Mastercard somwhere in the middle. And we could call them \u201crecession resistant\u201d because while spending overall would slow down in a bad economy, people still would buy groceries, pay bills, and make essential purchases (like YOLO\u2019ing 0DTE calls on Robinhood). Their revenue growth slows, but rarely turns negative.\n\nAmerican Express on the other hand is slightly more cyclical because like I mentioned earlier, they hold credit risk. And in a down market, they have less spending and ostensibly some charge-offs in loans. But an odd thing is happening with Amex in that since they cater to rich customers and since the Fed has contributed to massive wealth inequality (facts prove this) it\u2019s almost as if their customrs have become \u201crecession proof\u201d in the traditional sense. In theory Amex should be cyclical, but maybe not in practice.\n\nAnd if I were looking at these companies relative to my beloved cyclical banks, Visa and Mastercard are definitely less cyclical, while Amex is probably right in line.\n\nWhat Kind of Numbers Are They Putting Up?",

Amid rising interest rates over the past few years, one thing that has remained relatively strong is consumer spending. Last quarter, consumer spending increased by 4.2%, the fastest pace since Q1 2023. In December alone, spending rose by 0.7%, topping analysts' estimates.\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis report also shows that Americans were saving less to spend more. Income increased by just 0.4%, which was less than spending, meaning that people reduced their savings to make up the difference. This isn't a great sign for Americans' personal finances, but it helps companies like Visa and Mastercard. More spending drives higher payment volumes that go through these companies' networks. These companies mainly generate revenue by charging fees on the value of transactions.\n\nGet Mastercard alerts: Sign Up\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll discuss recent results from these two financial services stocks that are showing strong consumer spending translates to their business. I\u2019ll also discuss the potential impact of tariffs on the business and why I am not overly concerned.\n\nVolume, Revenue, and Earnings Growth Are Strong\n\nBoth companies saw strong increases in payment volume that went through their networks in the final quarter of 2024. The figure grew by 9% for Visa, an acceleration from 8% in Q3. For Mastercard, the figure increased by 12%, up from 10%. These are the most important drivers of revenue growth for both firms. They helped Visa's revenues increase by 11%, and Mastercard's revenues rise by 16% on a constant currency basis. This topline growth helped Visa and Mastercard increase their adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 14% and 22%, respectively.\n\nAnalyzing the Effect of Tariffs\n\nVisa Today V Visa $331.94 +3.40 (+1.03%) 52-Week Range $252.70 \u25bc $366.54 Dividend Yield 0.71% P/E Ratio 33.44 Price Target $353.96 Add to Watchlist\n\nWith President Trump's announcement of new tariffs on major trading partners, it is pertinent to discuss the potential impact on Visa and Mastercard. Trump announced tariffs of 10% on China, 25% on Canada, and 25% on Mexico. Trump agreed to pause the tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but they remain on the verge of implementation and would impact the economy significantly.\n\nLooking back at the first trade war Trump started with China can provide some insight. Trump began to put tariffs on China in Jul. 2018, before significantly reducing them in Jan. 2020. Through that period, Visa and Mastercard stock rose by 53% and 43%, respectively. Both companies' cross-border transaction volume increased substantially over that time. Theoretically, tariffs could negatively impact cross-border transaction volume as consumers don\u2019t want to pay higher prices. However, this can lead to consumers simply switching to similar products from their home country, which Visa and Mastercard can still collect fees on.\n\nMastercard Today MA Mastercard $527.61 +7.78 (+1.50%) 52-Week Range $428.86 \u25bc $582.23 Dividend Yield 0.58% P/E Ratio 37.97 Price Target $606.11 Add to Watchlist\n\nUltimately, the big worry for Visa and Mastercard around tariffs is that they could substantially reduce economic growth, leading to a reduction in payment volume. This is a real possibility if tariffs are in place for an extended period. Forecasters at JPMorgan Chase & Co. NYSE: JPM would lower their growth forecasts by 0.5% to 1% if tariffs on Mexico and Canada were in place for an extended period. However, they also forecast inflation to increase by the same amount. Inflation due to tariffs raises Visa and Mastercard's payment volume and corresponding fee revenue.\n\nThus, tariffs may overall result in a neutral impact on Visa and Mastercard payment revenues as growth slows and prices rise. At this point, I don\u2019t see tariffs as a big risk for Visa and Mastercard going forward.\n\nOutlook for Visa and Mastercard\n\nVisa and Mastercard allow much of the world economy to operate, and they can continue expanding. The payments industry is massive. It stretches from everything to cash, card, check, wire payments, invoicing, disbursements, and remittances. Mastercard believes there is a $154 trillion total serviceable payment volume market it can target. Just think of all the payments in emerging market countries that still use cash over cards. In 2024, Visa and Mastercard combined for approximately a total of $24 trillion in payment volume. This signals that there is substantial room for these companies to grow into their total market as digitization expands.\n\nAnalysts on Wall Street broadly raised price targets on both firms after their latest results. The average of analysts' price targets after recent earnings suggests a 12% upside for Visa and a 14% upside for Mastercard versus their Feb. 3 closing prices. Overall, I remain bullish on Visa and Mastercard shares. Barring a global economic slowdown or recession, these stocks can continue to impress.\n\nBefore you consider Mastercard, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Mastercard wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Mastercard currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

Unlock Family Pooling\n\nFamily pooling is reserved for Frontier Miles members of Silver Elite status or higher, but Frontier Airlines World cardholders can access it with or without elite status.\n\nWith family pooling, you can open a family pool and invite up to 8 friends and family members to join and share their Frontier miles. That makes it easy to book group travel with miles contributions.\n\nBooking together has distinct advantages, including Zone 2 priority boarding for all passengers sharing your itinerary if you maintain Elite Gold status.\n\n5. Keep Miles From Expiring\n\nThe Frontier Miles program\u2019s miles expire after 12 months without account activity, which is relatively short compared to other airline loyalty programs, which typically allow up to 24 months without activity before miles expire.\n\nWith the Frontier Airlines World card, your miles stay active as long as you keep the card open and in good standing.\n\nHot Tip: Need more miles? Check out these other great ways to earn more Frontier miles.\n\nTravel Benefits\n\nLike any good airline card, the Frontier Airlines World card offers benefits that can be used when you fly with the airline, including priority Zone 2 boarding, a $100 annual flight voucher, and travel protection benefits.\n\n6. Priority Boarding\n\nCardholders enjoy Zone 2 boarding.\n\nFrontier Airlines World cardholders can enjoy priority Zone 2 boarding on Frontier-operated flights. If you maintain Elite Gold status, you can board in Zone 1. Priority boarding makes it easy to get on the plane and get settled early.\n\n7. Free Checked Bags\n\nAs a Frontier Airlines World cardholder, you can check 2 free bags on each flight. Prefer to carry on? You get a free carry-on bag if you maintain Elite Gold status.\n\n8. Anniversary Flight Voucher\n\nThe Frontier Airlines World card\u2019s welcome offer comes with a $100 flight voucher, but you can earn another $100 flight voucher every year after your account anniversary. All you have to do is spend $2,500 on your card each year. However, the voucher doesn\u2019t apply to taxes and fees and is only good for 180 days from issue, so you have to redeem it within 6 months of earning it.\n\nSeveral credit cards have similar benefits, such as giving you a flight voucher after a certain amount of spending, but none require as little spending as this card.\n\nBottom Line: Just put a few hundred dollars in purchases on your card each month, and you get a voucher on your anniversary worth more than your annual fee. That makes keeping this card a pretty easy decision.\n\n9. Travel Protection Benefits\n\nThe Frontier Airlines World card offers travel protection benefits including:\n\nTrip cancellation and interruption insurance of up to $1,500 and up to $250 for ground transportation expenses\n\nof up to $1,500 and up to $250 for ground transportation expenses Baggage delay insurance for $100 per day for up to 3 days\n\nfor $100 per day for up to 3 days Up to $250,000 per person in travel accident insurance\n\nSecondary rental car coverage\n\nMastercard Global Service for 24/7 lost and stolen card reporting and emergency card replacement\n\nOther credit cards may offer better coverage, such as up to $20,000 per trip cancellation or interruption incident with the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae, but may have a higher annual fee than the Frontier Airlines World card\u2019s $99 annual fee.\n\n10. No Foreign Transaction Fees\n\nThe Frontier Airlines World card waives foreign transaction fees. You don \u2019t have to pay extra \u2014 typically 3% \u2014 when you make a purchase in a foreign transaction, whether you\u2019re in a foreign country or making purchases from a foreign website.\n\nFinancial Benefits\n\nWith the Frontier Airlines World card, you can get 15 months to pay off balance transfers interest-free, are protected from fraud, and can access your FICO credit score.\n\n11. $0 Fraud Liability Protection\n\nFraud liability protection is fairly standard on most credit cards but still worth noting as a benefit. If your card is compromised \u2014 whether physically taken or digitally faked \u2014 you are not responsible for any charges you did not make.\n\n12. Complimentary Credit Score\n\nThis card allows you to check your FICO credit score for free, and it also lets you set up alerts so you receive a message when your credit score changes.\n\nMonitoring your credit is one of the best things you can do to understand how to improve your credit score, maintain good credit, and qualify for the best credit cards.\n\n13. 0% Introductory APR for Balance Transfers\n\nThe Frontier Airlines World card offers a 0% intro APR for 15 months on balance transfers made within 45 days of account opening, then a variable APR of 20.24% to 29.99%.. Balance transfers to this card incur a fee of $5 or 5% of the transfer, whichever is greater.\n\nThis can be helpful if you have a large purchase that you need to pay off over a few months. Make sure to clear your balance within 15 months before interest charges apply.\n\n14. Partner Benefits\n\nCardholders get additional savings benefits from partners, including:\n\n2 months of Instacart+ and $10 off your second order each month when you use your card\n\n$3 statement credit when you use your card to subscribe to Peacock\n\nComplimentary ShopRunner membership\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlternative Card to the Frontier Airlines World Card\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred card is a good alternative to the Frontier Airlines World card if you want a flexible travel rewards card with an annual fee under $100. You can use the Chase Sapphire Preferred card to earn Chase Ultimate Rewards points, which can be redeemed flexibly for travel, cash-back, and more, so you\u2019re not limited to Frontier Airlines redemptions. While the Chase Sapphire Preferred card doesn\u2019t offer airline-specific benefits like the Frontier Airlines World card, it has travel protection benefits, including primary rental car insurance and up to $20,000 per trip cancellation and interruption insurance.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Frontier Airlines World card is compelling for frequent Frontier flyers, especially if you value elite status and accelerated miles earning. Instant Elite Gold status, free checked bags, and a $100 annual flight voucher can quickly offset the $99 annual fee.\n\nThis card isn\u2019t the best fit for travelers who need flexibility to fly with other airlines, but it can come in handy if you often take advantage of Frontier\u2019s low-cost flights. If you\u2019re comfortable flying an ultra-low-cost carrier, the Frontier Airlines World card can help you make the most of your Frontier travel experience.",

I\u2019m Marc Andrusko, partner at a16z. In this episode of \u201cIn the Vault,\u201d I talk to Greg Ulrich, Chief AI and Data Officer at Mastercard. We dive into Greg\u2019s fascinating journey from working in the nonprofit sector to shaping AI strategy at one of the world\u2019s largest financial services companies. Our conversation explores how Mastercard has been leveraging AI for decades, the transformative role of generative AI in payments and commerce, and Greg\u2019s insights into building trusted AI ecosystems. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nMarc: Greg, thank you so much for joining us on \u201cIn the Vault.\u201d It\u2019s great to see you.\n\nGreg: Thank you, Marc.\n\nMarc: Yes. Obviously, you and I have had the pleasure of knowing each other for a bit now, but maybe for our audience, you know, we\u2019d love for you to share a bit about your background and your journey.\n\nGreg: Yeah, sure. Thanks. So, Greg Ulrich. I\u2019m the chief AI and data officer here at Mastercard, and it\u2019s obviously a tremendous time to be in AI. We have so much excitement, so much energy, so much opportunity. At the same time, like, the future is still to be written on this. We\u2019re very early days, like, what the future is going to hold, and more importantly, the path we take to get there is still unwritten. So it\u2019s an awesome time to have this job.\n\nMy journey in this space, well, I guess it started in university, but I really got into it in working in the nonprofit sector a couple of decades ago. I was trying to help organizations understand the efficacy of different interventions. If you want to address clean water in certain communities, what\u2019s the best way to do that? Or if you want to address malaria, what\u2019s the organization that has the best approach? How do you determine what intervention, what strategy, what approach, what organization is having the most impact on whatever cause you care about? And I realized the data, the analytics, the ability to analyze that in the sector was limited, and ended up working at a company after that called APT or Applied Predictive Technologies. And that was really around how do you differentiate between causality and correlation and how do you identify the real impact of any intervention, any test, any experiment, anything you\u2019re doing differentially in a market. And it has a lot of power for the nonprofit sector and what we\u2019re looking at.\n\nAnd I wanted two things there. One, how able you are if you have the right data and analytics to understand what\u2019s working and measure that impact, and also how easy it is to misuse data and analytics if you\u2019re not careful about it. And long story short, APT got bought by Mastercard about a decade ago. After that, I did a variety of roles here in our services division. And then, starting in 2000, I led strategy, M&A, and CorpDev for about four and a half years. And then, ironically, I was at an a16z event earlier this year, and our CEO called and asked if I would do this AI and data role. And I\u2019ve been doing this since Q2 of this year and loving every minute of it.\n\nMarc: So it\u2019s fair to say, we\u2019re solely responsible for you getting the job.\n\nGreg: Entirely responsible.\n\nMarc: Yeah, that\u2019s fantastic.\n\nGreg: I think that\u2019s the takeaway.\n\nMarc: Yeah, exactly. Amazing. Well, we\u2019re super excited you\u2019re in the role. And I think we\u2019re in total alignment that, obviously, there\u2019s never been a better time to be thinking about some of this stuff. I\u2019m curious, a company as large and important to the financial and money movement ecosystem as Mastercard surely has been using artificial intelligence for a long time. But, you know, as of, call it, 2022, with the onset of ChatGPT and things of that nature, we\u2019ve now kind of moved into this wave of, specifically, generative AI. So I\u2019m curious, how do you think about the sort of distinction between those two sets of technologies and the various sets of opportunities that exist for Mastercard today?\n\nGreg: Sure. And you\u2019re right, we\u2019ve been using AI for decades. It\u2019s inherent in everything we do in fraud detection, right? I mean, we\u2019ve been monitoring transactions to try to provide insights to merchants and issuers about if a transaction is fraudulent or not, to help make better decisions and make sure that the ecosystem moves in a secure and efficient way. And artificial intelligence is behind a lot of that, as well as what we do in personalization, forecasting, intelligence products we\u2019re giving to our customers. So this has been inherent to what Mastercard has been doing for quite some time. And obviously, two years ago or, you know, two years and maybe a month ago, with the advent of GenAI really to the forefront, it\u2019s created new opportunities. But for us, like, what technology to use, it\u2019s really dependent on the use case.\n\nIf you have structured data, you\u2019re doing forecasting models, a lot of the fraud management, traditional artificial intelligence/machine learning is going to be more efficient, more effective, and certainly more cost-effective as a way to do it. When you\u2019re dealing with knowledge management, when you\u2019re trying to synthesize or when you\u2019re trying to create new content, when you\u2019re dealing with unstructured data, then you\u2019re looking at newer and different techniques. So for us, you know, it\u2019s very use-case dependent. We\u2019re trying to understand, what is the problem we\u2019re trying to solve, and then what is the right analytic approach to get there?\n\nAnd for some of it, we have fraud solutions that are based on, you know, machine learning that we\u2019ve been using for years. Now, we\u2019re able to bring in sort of new features using GenAI techniques to make an existing product better. GenAI, if you will, is a feature as opposed to a product. In other places, we\u2019re using it for digital assistance and other things where it really is a GenAI-based solution. But again, it comes back to the problem. It comes back to the use case and what we\u2019re trying to solve for.\n\nMarc: A hundred percent. Yeah, no, that makes a ton of sense. And I imagine, if you were looking at the whiteboard of possibilities of all the places you could apply this technology, the list is sort of never-ending within the context of Mastercard. But as I was preparing for this conversation, I spent some time looking at some of the announcements you all have made, and it sounds like two of the early things you\u2019ve shipped with respect specifically to generative AI have been, to the point you just made, one, a digital sort of onboarding assistant for some of your customers, and then two, are specific new fraud capabilities that maybe actually are leveraging the generative parts of AI and not just the traditional machine learning techniques you alluded to. Maybe you could just tell us a little bit about how you sort of landed on those two things as early use cases to launch in the organization and how they\u2019re going thus far.\n\nGreg: Sure. So I\u2019ll get to those two specifically, but maybe I\u2019ll give you the frame of more over how I think about where AI has opportunity for Mastercard, and I\u2019ll bring it into four buckets as shorthand. They\u2019re safer, smarter, more personal, and stronger. I\u2019ll explain what I mean by those. But as I mentioned earlier, like, where we started in our AI journey, where a lot of what we\u2019re doing today is in fraud management, fraud detection, fraud identification, and how we\u2019re doing things to make the ecosystem secure. That\u2019s on a transaction-by-transaction basis. And how do we provide intelligence to determine if a specific transaction is fraudulent or not? But also, how do we look at scams? How do we look at pain points across the entire ecosystem to see if there are hotspots in the network where we\u2019re seeing more fraud and there might be malicious actors? And how do we shut that down, and how do we deal with it? So that\u2019s how we make the eCommerce ecosystem safer.\n\nThe second one is how we make it smarter. That\u2019s, how do we route transactions in the most efficient way, how do we provide insights to acquirers, issuers, merchants to help them optimize their portfolio and deal with their own customers in the most effective way, providing intelligence based on the data we see and the analytics we can deploy on top of that, when should you authorize a transaction, should you retry a transaction, etc.\n\nThe third one is how we make the ecosystem more personal. So we are a B2B2C business. We don\u2019t have much in the direct-to-consumer realm, but we do help our partners, the banks, the merchants, personalize things so they can provide the right offer at the right time to the right customer. And we have software tools that do that, and a lot of those rely on artificial intelligence. And that\u2019s the more personal element. And all of those are external. How do we create value for the ecosystem? How do we create value for our customers?\n\nAnd the fourth bucket is, how do I make Mastercard stronger? How do we improve our own operations? A lot of that is on the productivity, the efficiency pieces. It\u2019s around how do we put knowledge in the hands of our employees, how do we make their roles simpler, be it software engineers from coding, our sales team by providing better access to information. And those are the sort of areas in which we\u2019re deploying AI and particularly GenAI overall. So I\u2019ll put these things that we\u2019ve shipped into those buckets.\n\nThe first one around fraud, the product we have is called Decision Intelligence. And that\u2019s where, in the milliseconds we have between when a transaction passes through our network, from when you tap to buy something in a store, it passes through Mastercard to go to the issuer, we\u2019re providing a score on that based on how likely that is a good or bad transaction. We use GenAI, recurrent neural networks, and other technologies to effectively add features to that by understanding not just your transaction history but the overall ecosystem of merchant behaviors and create, basically, a merchant vector database in there to help understand whether or not this is likely to be a good or bad transaction, even if you\u2019ve never shopped at that merchant before, because we can see like behaviors from other consumers. And so it\u2019s basically adding a feature to the model to give us a more accurate score, and we\u2019ve been able to prove that over time. So that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019ve done in fraud.\n\nIn personalization, we have something called Shopping Muse, which is basically enabling the in-store experience online. So you have a chatbot, effectively, where you can type in your own language and ask for recommendations. \u201cI\u2019m going to be on an a16z podcast with Marc. What should I wear?\u201d And it\u2019ll give recommendations. Or, \u201cI\u2019m going to a wedding,\u201d so and so, \u201cwhat should I do?\u201d And it\u2019s allowing you to interact like you would with an in-store agent using all of GenAI techniques to make, again, personalization, a better experience for the end consumer.\n\nAnd then the digital assistant you mentioned, one of the things that we\u2019re trying to do is making it easier for our customers, the banks, the merchants, to consume and integrate Mastercard products. And these have a lot of technical specs, a lot of steps sometimes to bring them on board within the bank ecosystem, within the merchant ecosystem. So what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve created a digital assistant that uses RAG and points to all of these technical databases, the Q&A\u2019s we\u2019ve had over time where we\u2019ve tested and fine-tuned these models to enable customers to onboard our products easier by automating a lot of manual tasks and by creating an environment where they can ask questions and we can get answers back to them much more rapidly. We do put a human in the loop of this. So the chatbot is actually directed at our agents, but it still really reduces the time that it takes a customer to bring on a Mastercard product, which helps them drive value from those much more rapidly.\n\nMarc: Sitting in my seat, I\u2019ve had the privilege of speaking to a lot of folks at large enterprises who are trying to make sense of this GenAI wave and figure out what solutions do we want to buy, what solutions do we want to build, where do we want to partner, etc. And I think there is this notion that, you know, one of the most hazardous things a super early-stage company can do is go to a prospect and say, \u201cOh, well, we built this amazing AI thing, but in order for us to prove how valuable it is, you have to share a bunch of your enterprise\u2019s data with us.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cWell, hold on just a second, you know, we have to safeguard that asset.\u201d Whereas, again, you all occupy such a privileged position of being the trusted partner to millions of merchants and acquirers and banks. And I think it probably makes for a much easier ask to be able to leverage this data in ways that are mutually beneficial, understanding that, as you always have, you will continue to safeguard it. So I think that\u2019s it.\n\nGreg: Yeah. And you need to make sure they\u2019re partners that have the same values, the same approach, the same commitment to working through these things as you do. Otherwise, you get into a difficult situation. But we put the safeguarding of data at the absolute pinnacle of what we need to do here because we recognize the downside and we recognize the importance of maintaining the position we have as a trusted brand and trusted ecosystem. I mean, it\u2019s what enables our payment network to thrive the way it does. It\u2019s when you\u2019re in a place you\u2019ve never been, shopping at a place that you\u2019ve never shopped, that you know if you tap your card or dip your card or swipe your card, but the merchant knows they\u2019re going to get paid, you know you\u2019re going to get the product, you know if there\u2019s a problem, you have recourse. The ecosystem works, and it\u2019s because the network enables trust. And that goes the same with how we use data and how we treat data and how we treat the products and services that sit on top of that.\n\nMarc: Yep. Well, I do have to ask, given I\u2019m sure there are many founders and operators who are listening to this, many of whom don\u2019t have the benefit of decades in business as a trusted and known entity but are very eager to work with the Mastercards of the world. I\u2019m curious, as you think about which solutions you\u2019re interested in sort of buying or partnering or plugging in a vendor for, and you\u2019re approached by, you know, an earlier growth stage technology company, what are some of the criteria you and the team are using to help you decide, you know, where are you going to prioritize your time and resources and the types of players that you\u2019re excited to do business with?\n\nGreg: Yeah. So a couple of things there. Where we\u2019re prioritizing, where we\u2019re spending our time still comes back to where the areas that we think that we\u2019re focused on AI, the safer, stronger, personal, smarter. We then look within those about, if it\u2019s a new GenAI solution, where there are manual tasks or unstructured data, where GenAI is actually the right tool for the problem back to, you know, when you\u2019re using GenAI versus traditional AI solutions. And then it comes down to sort of the feasibility, the viability of the different opportunities that we\u2019re seeing in those spaces we\u2019re looking to prioritize what we\u2019re doing.\n\nMastercard has a long history of partnering with early-stage companies. We do it in a variety of ways. We\u2019ve embraced the fintech community, and we have relationships with so many early-stage fintechs in our ecosystem. We have a program called Start Path that sort of enables early-stage companies to plug into the Mastercard network, get the value of what we bring, as well as some support alongside that. We\u2019ve had connections from my old job in corporate development about where we\u2019ve invested and partnered with a lot of early-stage companies. So we embrace the early-stage community, and we\u2019re looking to partner with them whenever we can. We\u2019re strategy-first. It has to fit within where we\u2019re trying to deploy solutions based on what needs we\u2019re solving for a customer and then sort of the prioritization areas that we have within that. But then, if there\u2019s a company that has sort of, we think, the best approach to that and we think that they fit within our approach to governance and security, then we\u2019re always happy to partner if we think that that\u2019s the most efficient way forward.\n\nMarc: Yeah. And in that process, I\u2019m curious, so you now occupy this really interesting sort of top-down horizontal leader charged with making sense of this AI wave and making sure that the organization at large is taking advantage of it. But I also imagine that there are P&L owners, GMs, folks in a more vertical setting who are making similar decisions for their specific business unit, and they can help answer those questions of how, you know, specific GenAI capabilities are going to make them smarter, stronger, and sort of all of those criteria. For founders who are looking to navigate the organization, both Mastercard but also generally speaking, where there is a senior horizontal decision maker charged with innovation or AI and then there are vertical business leaders, how do you think about\u2026could you articulate sort of how decisions get made in that capacity? And I think you\u2019ve described to me how that spoke in the past. Like, maybe just walk folks through how that works at a big company like Mastercard.\n\nGreg: Sure. So what we have done in this structure that our CEO put in place earlier this year was create a new group for AI and data. Now, that\u2019s not centralizing every activity in a company the size of ours. Again, artificial intelligence, like electricity, it\u2019s just a part of so much of the organization it would be foolish, dangerous, and probably impossible to try to strip out all of those elements and centralize them into one place. At the same time, you can have people trying to solve similar problems in different places in an uncoordinated way, which is problematic. So the way the hub and spoke model works is I and my team from an enterprise-wide standpoint are looking at where we think the technology has the greatest opportunity to drive value for our customers and to drive value ultimately for our shareholders. Where do we think that there are opportunities? And I bring that to the business partners, in HR, in finance, in fraud securities, in open banking, in our core payments business, to talk about these opportunities.\n\nAt the same time, the leaders of all those businesses are always trying to innovate, always trying to find new solutions, and they\u2019re coming up with ideas, and they\u2019re bringing them to our team. And you have that two-way collaboration and discussion. And what we now enable is, one, if they\u2019re trying to go about something, we have a lot of learnings across the organization about what\u2019s working and what doesn\u2019t. A lot of this requires the right access to the data, the right tools. We want to reuse things and patterns that we\u2019ve seen work and avoid those that we haven\u2019t. And so there\u2019s a lot of that learning that my team can bring to that part of the organization to make sure we\u2019re innovating in the best way and the most efficient way. And at the same time, we\u2019re not trying to own the ideation and the product development and the business development that those groups are doing. That\u2019s their job. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing by running their businesses. And they\u2019re coming up with those ideas and bringing them to us.\n\nSo it\u2019s that two-way street communication where we get the best ideas and then also make sure that we\u2019re not being duplicative, or if we found an approach or a vendor or model that\u2019s efficient, that we build on top of that, because that\u2019s going to be a faster time to market. It\u2019s going to be a more effective solution. We know it\u2019s going to work within our governance and our privacy rules and rubric.\n\nMarc: Yep. And then, what about for, like, ongoing, okay, you\u2019ve implemented a vendor or a model or you\u2019ve leaned into a solution in some capacity, and it\u2019s been in market for a year, and you\u2019re trying to assess, did they deliver upon the ROI, or did we collectively deliver upon the ROI that we thought we were going to deliver? Are you thinking about that process separate and distinct from what I\u2019m sure is a very robust vendor management motion that already exists at the firm? Or at that point, is it, \u201cOkay, the current machinery we have in place already does a good job of figuring out which vendors are working, which vendors are duplicative?\u201d Like, does it get kind of put into the machine, or is it still kind of carved out as, like, \u201cThis is new and exploratory in AI land and we need to figure out a different way to measure ROI?\u201d\n\nGreg: Yeah. Like, my team owns that. We\u2019ve sort of spun up an approach where every new initiative has a key set of KPIs. We establish targets for those, and we have a plan to measure those over time. I think, particularly at this stage of these new GenAI use cases to find out what\u2019s working, how we\u2019re driving value for our customers, how we\u2019re driving value for our employees, how we\u2019re driving value for the ecosystem, it\u2019s important to look at those specifically. So if I look at what we\u2019re doing for our software engineers and developers around coding assistance, yeah, I want to understand what the efficiency is for them. I want to understand we have different interventions for training and pointing into different elements of the life cycle if that efficiency gets higher. But just as importantly, or more importantly, what\u2019s the feedback? What is the customer satisfaction with these? Like, if we\u2019re taking away parts of the job that people don\u2019t find as exciting, then they can redeploy that time to answering harder questions and doing more thinking to improve the throughput of the ecosystem, and that increases satisfaction, that\u2019s really what we\u2019re after.\n\nAnd so you have different sort of measurement and KPIs for different initiatives, but right now, I am looking at everything that we\u2019re rolling out there, trying to establish, like, what are we trying to measure, measuring that over time, and making sure those learnings come back so we figure out where we\u2019re going to deploy effectively, you know, our capital and scarce resources to have the biggest bang for the buck. While we do that for everything we do, I am taking a slightly bigger focus and putting a shinier light or a brighter light on some of the GenAI solutions that we\u2019re putting out to market.\n\nMarc: Yep. One other question I had was your role is really interesting in the sense that I think Mastercard has almost 33,000 people, it\u2019s a very large company, and in order to figure out where AI could have the highest potential impact, you have to have a very deep understanding of the operation of the organization, which, for a company that large, you could spend all of your time kind of mapping out and figuring out. Simultaneously, to make sure you\u2019re picking things that are best in class and the breakneck speed at which this software is developing, you kind of also have to have an ear to the ground of what\u2019s happening outside the four walls of the organization and kind of stay up to date with all of the rapid progress that\u2019s being made. Like, are there any either sources or processes or rituals you have to make sure that you\u2019re kind of staying up to date on on the latest?\n\nGreg: Yeah. I say it\u2019s a combination of a few things. One, I guess some of the good news is in my last job, and the strategy role gave me pretty good training of trying to keep an eye over a very broad ecosystem and what\u2019s happening in that. But the amount of time I spend listening to podcasts, reading external news, and also just networking and talking to others both about how they\u2019re deploying AI, how they\u2019re organizing their organization, like, \u201cThis hub and spoke model, there are a lot of ways to do it. What do you federate? What do you centralize? How do you coordinate most effectively? How do you balance innovation and speed with the right governance?\u201d like, there\u2019s a lot that you can learn from others. So I spend a lot\u2026like, just today, if I think about it, I\u2019ve listened to a handful of podcasts. I\u2019ve read a bunch of articles. I\u2019ve done two networking calls. We\u2019re doing this podcast. It\u2019s a lot more time external. We had an event last night with a lot of external parties at a dinner, which was just sort of a sharing ecosystem and talking about what we\u2019re doing and trying to learn from others.\n\nWhen we presented to our board of directors on AI in September, one way we structured is I had seven external speakers come in, right, to give different perspectives from an investor perspective, the CEO of one of the leading LLMs. We partner with Databricks quite a bit. We had someone from their C-suite come in. We had academics come in providing these perspectives. So our senior leadership, myself, my team are hearing a variety of different perspectives because it\u2019s changing rapidly. And unless you keep an ear to the ground, like, you\u2019re not going to stay up on the latest and greatest.\n\nMarc: Yep. And while you and I sit here and, I think, can clearly articulate why we\u2019re so excited about this technology and where we see potential for ROI, I\u2019m curious, you know, Mastercard, again, sits in this really interesting position at the nexus of issuing banks and acquiring banks and processors and merchants, all sorts of distinct constituents in the same sort of payments and commerce ecosystem. As you\u2019ve been out in the market, thinking about the future of this technology, are you finding that everyone is ubiquitously excited and eager to adopt it, or are there any constituents in that map that I just drew out who are really hesitant or, you know, are worried? Like, would you say it\u2019s been unbridled excitement, or are you seeing kind of both sides of the coin?\n\nGreg: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unbridled excitement. I think there\u2019s a lot of concern out there, particularly in a regulated industry, like some of the places in which we touch and in which we work. There\u2019s enthusiasm, but it\u2019s definitely not unbridled, as people are very worried about the accuracy, the hallucination, the efficacy of these. And particularly as you start pointing these to customer-facing solutions, there\u2019s a very high bar on what that has to achieve, and I don\u2019t think a lot of these solutions are at that point, even with fine-tuning, even with pointing at the right data. And so a lot of what we\u2019re seeing is a human in the loop or putting things behind a human to enable your own employees to get the insights and information but sort of holding off on the direct application to the consumer.\n\nNow, not every organization is the same, and some people are leaning into this more, but I think there\u2019s a lot of people that want to see this proven out and want to see the continued improvements in the underlying models, the improvements in the accuracy. And we are early days. Like, we\u2019re seeing improvements every time there\u2019s a new iteration in accuracy, in speed, in latency, in cost performance, you know, and these things evolve over time. And so I think everybody\u2019s a little bit patient on this as well to make sure that we take advantage of this while also managing the \u201cdo no harm\u201d element of some of it as well, particularly in financial services.\n\nMarc: Yep. Maybe just to close out, you know, the world is your oyster in some senses in this seat. Like, if I had to put you on the spot and you had to pick one or two things that you\u2019re just brimming with excitement over, like, what are you thinking about most for maybe the next year or two? Like, what has you most excited?\n\nGreg: So I think the things I have my eye on for the next year are, one is how we interact with models and AI is changing, I think, in a couple of ways that we\u2019re seeing more and more, one around sort of multimodality and being able to look at not just text but the integration of text and images and voice and video, and for a lot of instances that we think about. Like, you could think of what the insurance companies are now able to do, where they can piece together photos of an accident with the data from the policy, from the information from, you know, their manuals and what they have internally to come up with a much faster and more effective estimate. When we think about things in financial services, like invoice reconciliation, bill pay, you\u2019ll have these things come in as PDFs, you\u2019ll have them come in as images, you\u2019ll have them come in as text, in a variety of ways, as we start looking at things holistically in different modalities and still come up with a single source of truth that\u2019s very exciting.\n\nAnd then I think the reasoning models and the evolution we\u2019re seeing on those is very exciting as well. It opens up new use cases. And for me, what\u2019s exciting is some of the experimentation I\u2019ve seen on those where it\u2019s not just the accuracy that is improving but the percentage of time, the significant increase in percentage of time that those models will basically say, \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to a question,\u201d which, you know, as we go back to risk and we go back to, you know, how models are improving and what we need to see, knowing the limits, just take AI out of it, if you\u2019re a human being, knowing the limits of your knowledge is incredibly important.\n\nI remember when I took my last job and I was presenting to the board every couple of months, the best advice I ever got was, \u201cThe best thing to say when you don\u2019t know the answer is I don\u2019t know the answer. The worst thing is to try to fake your way through it.\u201d And that\u2019s true in life, but it\u2019s certainly the case with AI. And AI, if it doesn\u2019t know the answer, it still sounds very lucid and erudite its wrong answer. So it\u2019s not just wrong, but it\u2019s confidently wrong. I go back to where we started this conversation, Marc, around APT and the ability to misuse analytics and data, and the challenge and the danger that has is real. And so as these reasoning models are understanding their limits better and knowing, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t know the answer to that question,\u201d much more effectively than some of the foundational models, I think that\u2019s an exciting evolution in this space. So the first one is around how we\u2019re dealing with AI is changing.\n\nThe second one is I do think that this move to trust, this moved to responsibility, how that\u2019s incorporated, how we bring transparency in, still has its day. And we\u2019re leaning in hard on that dimension. I think that\u2019s going to be a big trend, not just in 25 but for the next few years. But I continue to think that how we do this in a trusted way is really critical. And then I think the third thing is we\u2019re seeing\u2026and who knows where the scaling laws will go and how much better the models will get as we add more data, as we add more compute, as we add more time to train them. But I do think that the use of data becomes a more critical differentiator, inference becomes a more critical differentiator, and I think that\u2019s the other thing that we\u2019re looking at. And that matters quite a bit for us, given the data that we have and the data we have inside our organization that we can use and leverage to help bring better insights to our employees and help make better solutions for our customers.\n\nMarc: Yep. Well, I got to say, talking to you reminds me that we\u2019re both very fortunate to sit at the front row of all this stuff that\u2019s unfolding. I\u2019m leaving this conversation fired up about the many opportunities that lie ahead for Mastercard with both generative AI but also generally. And so I really appreciate you spending time with us today. Thanks for coming on.\n\nGreg: Thank you so much, Marc.

            "content": "Mastercard intends to do away with the 16-digit number on their credit and debit cards and replace them with on-device biometrics and tokenization as part of a plan to quash identity theft and fraud.\n\nIn Australia the initial rollout of these new numberless cards will be via a partnership with AMP Bank, but other banks are expected to follow over the next 12 months.\n\nMastercard recently committed to phasing out manual card entry and static passwords by 2030 in favor of tokenization and biometrics, and to replace traditional authentication methods with on-device biometrics for users to authenticate purchases without exposing personal data online.\n\nIn a piece for The Conversation, the authors observed that we could ultimately be heading towards the end of cards. It is a fact that hackers often target businesses such as travel or hospitality operators or online companies. For example, Ticketmaster was hacked in a major breach last year resulting in several hundred million customers\u2019 personal details accessed illegally. This means credit card numbers, among other sensitive information, are leaked.\n\nRemoving the numbers prevents fraudsters from using your card when they don\u2019t have the physical card, which is known as card-not-present transactions.\n\nUltimately, the removal of card numbers might pale against the removal of cards altogether. The Mastercard Biometric Checkout Program removes the need for retail customers to bring a physical card altogether, rely on biometrics more fully, with consumers paying for things just with their face, or palm payments, for example.\n\nLlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch now a Click to Pay capital\n\nMastercard is teaming up with seven of Europe\u2019s longest-named towns in a show of its latest convenience for online shoppers.\n\nEurope\u2019s longest-named town is Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, which is found in Wales. At 58 letters it\u2019s a bit of a pain for residents to input when filling in credit card details online to pay for things.\n\nThis is where Mastercard is showcasing its Click to Pay, which the company says is a faster, simpler and more secure way to pay online. In a new study, 93 percent of Britons type out their full address and 95 percent their 16-digit card number when shopping online despite nearly half \u2013 48 percent \u2013 finding it a hassle to do so. This problem is intensified when you live in Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.\n\nOr if you live in the Netherlands\u2019 Westerhaar-Vriezenveensewijk. Mastercard is making seven of these \u201csesquipedalian\u201d towns across Europe a Mastercard Click to Pay Capital. The feature allows shoppers to pay with one click, without needing to share long card numbers.\n\n\u201cThe secure process called \u2018tokenisation\u2019 replaces the card number with random numbers, or tokens, for each transaction, which are meaningless if stolen,\u201d explained Simon Forbes, Division President, UK and Ireland, Mastercard. \u201cThis not only protects consumers from scammers but also protects retailers from cybersecurity and data breach threats.\u201d\n\nPayment passkeys allow online shoppers checking out to choose their Mastercard for Click to Pay, or a card already stored securely on file with a merchant, then confirm payments with biometric authentication through on-device fingerprint or facial scan.\n\nIt\u2019s one solution to a real problem \u2014 more than 36 million (67 percent) of UK shoppers abandoned online shopping at the checkout last year due to security concerns, lack of payment options, or forgotten card details.\n\nConsumers are able to register their card with Click to Pay on their banking app or to look for the Click to Pay icon at checkout. Mastercard also has a YouTube video outlining Click to Pay, which also explains the Payment Passkey service for Tap Payments.\n\nArticle Topics\n\nbiometric authentication | biometric payments | biometrics | ecommerce | Mastercard | Mastercard Biometric Checkout Program | payment passkey | retail biometrics",

            "content": "Earlier this year, Visa and Mastercard settled a class action lawsuit that claimed they charged US merchants excessive fees to accept payments between 2004 and 2019.\n\nAt $5.5 billion dollars, it\u2019s one of the largest class action settlements in US history.\n\nMost US merchants are eligible for a share of the settlement funds if they took card payments in those years \u2013 but many eligible merchants still haven\u2019t filed a claim.\n\nIt\u2019s an easy process, and there\u2019s still time \u2013 but the deadline is approaching soon!\n\nKeep reading below for more information, or start your claim right now.\n\n1) Most US merchants are eligible\n\nNearly all merchants in the United States, who accepted Visa and/or Mastercard transactions between Jan 1, 2004 and Jan 25, 2019, should be eligible to file a claim. The specific amount a merchant may receive can vary based on a number of factors, including what fees they were charged, the types of cards used, and the total number of claims that are filed by the deadline. This amount will be calculated based on the merchant's total Visa/Mastercard transaction fees for the period (more details here).\n\n2) There is still time to file a claim\n\nThe court recently extended the claim filing deadline (now February 4, 2025) for this historic settlement. Why? Some merchants may not be aware of the settlement, some may not know how much money they could potentially receive, and others may find the process more intimidating than it should be.\n\nEligible merchants should have received a notice of eligibility in the mail, but many report that the notices have been missed, misplaced, or overlooked. The online form is easy to submit, and there is no penalty for filing a claim if it turns out that you\u2019re not eligible. Given the timespan covered by the settlement and the amount of money available, we recommend that any merchants who think they may be eligible to go ahead and file a claim. All links to file a claim in this blog post go directly to the official court-sponsored website \u2013 not a middleman.\n\n3) Here\u2019s how to file (it\u2019s easier than you think!)\n\nWe get it, filing a claim as part of a large class action settlement may be intimidating, but in this case it\u2019s surprisingly easy. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to do::\n\nNavigate to https://www.paymentcardsettlement.com/en/Login to create an account\n\nIf you have a notice you received in the mail, then navigate to \u201cEnter Claimant ID and Control Number\u201d\n\nIf you did not receive a notice in the mail, or don\u2019t have the notice, then navigate to \u201cProvide TIN\u201d\n\nFill in a short form with information about your business (things like tax ID, business name, and contact info).\n\nOnce this information is submitted, the process will kick off to estimate your total transaction fees.\n\n4) Don\u2019t forget to check back and finish the claim process\n\nLog back in and check for updates after submitting your claim .\n\n. You will see a status indicator for your claim, indicating whether you were confirmed as approved, rejected, still being processed, or if any other issues were encountered (more details here)\n\nIf you\u2019re eligible, you should then see an estimate of the total amount of interchange fees that are attributable to you. IMPORTANT: this is not the amount you will get in the settlement. That will be calculated later.\n\nYou\u2019ll can either accept those numbers and finalize your claim, or challenge those numbers and provide additional data to the claims administrator. We recommend that you work with your financial professional to address any lingering questions.\n\nAfter you finalize your claim, you\u2019ll have to wait a while \u2013 keep an eye out for communications from the claims administrator as they may reach out to you for follow-up questions or documentation.\n\nWe hope eligible merchants take the time to understand the money they can potentially receive as part of this settlement. File a claim now and see if you are entitled to funds.",

The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\n\n\n\nMETA has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.35 billion people daily. Meta\u2019s growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth.\n\n\n\nMeta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Mastercard have gained +24.1% over the past year against the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry\u2019s gain of +28.6%. The company beat earnings estimates by 3.8% in the fourth quarter. Acquisitions are helping Mastercard to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. It expects low-double-digit net revenue growth in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\nThe accelerated adoption of digital and contactless solutions is providing an opportunity for its business to expedite its shift to the digital mode. Strong cash flow supports its growth initiatives and enables shareholder value-boosting efforts through repurchases and dividends.\n\n\n\nWhile MA shares have lagged behind the industry in the past year, growing operations will likely support a future rebound. Steep operating expenses might stress its margins in the future. High rebates and incentives may weigh on net revenues. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here >>>)\n\n\n\nAdobe shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (-1.4% vs. -0.4%). The company is facing intensifying competition from the likes of Microsoft-backed OpenAI is concerning. Lack of monetization is a headwind for Adobe amid challenging macroeconomic conditions.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Adobe\u2019s prospects are expected to benefit from strong demand for its creative products. Its Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products have been driving top-line growth. New AI releases, including Express, Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly Services, DX premium tiers and GenStudio for Performance Marketing, have expanded the portfolio of products.\n\n\n\nThese are expected to drive Adobe\u2019s market share and monetization in the near future. Adobe\u2019s deepening generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) focus and innovative GenAI-powered portfolio are key catalysts.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Adobe here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Investors Title have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+39.7% vs. +18.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $417.72 million prioritizes shareholder value, declaring a $14.00 per share special dividend (December 2024) alongside its 46 cents regular quarterly dividend, funded entirely by cash reserves, highlighting strong liquidity.\n\n\n\nThe company benefits from a growing title insurance market driven by rising real estate transactions and digital adoption. Strategic diversification into tax-deferred exchanges and investment management enhances earnings stability, while digital transformation improves efficiency and customer engagement. Geographic expansion across multiple states mitigates local market risks and captures regional growth opportunities.\n\n\n\nHowever, rising commission expenses are pressuring margins, particularly in agent-driven markets like Texas and Florida. Regulatory changes in key states could increase compliance costs. Competition from larger insurers could further impact profitability.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Investors Title here >>>)\n\n\n\nMIND Technology shares have outperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the past six months (+100.4% vs. +66.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $13.24 million is benefiting from strong revenue growth, reaching $31.8 million for the nine months ending Oct. 31, 2024, driven by a robust $26 million backlog and a sales pipeline exceeding twice that amount. Net income of $3 million marks a turnaround from a $1.2 million prior-year loss, reflecting cost efficiencies and restructuring.\n\n\n\nRecurring aftermarket services, which comprise 40% of revenues, provide stable, high-margin income. Gross margins improved to 45%, supported by pricing power, higher-margin product sales and operational efficiencies. A debt-free balance sheet with $3.5 million in cash enhances financial flexibility.\n\n\n\nHowever, elevated inventory levels pose liquidity risks, and reliance on energy exploration exposes MIND to sector cyclicality. Competition from larger players, geopolitical risks, R&D uncertainties, and slow software adoption present additional challenges.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on MIND Technology here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Arista Networks Inc (ANET), The TJX Companies, Inc.

            "content": "Platform aims to boost small business financial stability and loan readiness.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Accion Opportunity Fund (AOF), a leading nonprofit dedicated to advancing small business economic mobility, in partnership with the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, has launched a new financial learning platform created specifically for small business. The platform, called Learn with AOF, targets improved small business financial stability with an eye toward helping the business build credit and capital readiness.\n\nLearn with AOF (http://aofund.org/learning)\n\nAOF has announced their vision to lend $750 million in new capital to underinvested businesses over the next five years, and Learn with AOF is critical to ensuring widespread access to these loans. Access to responsible and affordable small business capital is more important than ever, as crises from COVID to the L.A. wildfires threaten small business livelihoods.\n\n\"Our North Star is to become the first scalable, financially sustainable mission-driven lender for underserved small businesses in the U.S.,\" says Luz Urrutia, CEO of Accion Opportunity Fund. \"We must drastically scale our lending operation without giving up the personalized support we offer small business owners throughout their journeys. We created Learn with AOF by listening to small business owners who told us access to capital is a lifeline for their business, but existing online financial learning fell short of helping to strengthen their loan applications and build the financial knowledge they need for long-term success. Finding answers to specific financial challenges online was difficult and overwhelming.\"\n\nAccess to capital has long proven to have far-reaching impacts for small businesses. For every $1 invested in a small business, more than $2 is generated annually in new wages, spending and taxes, and every loan AOF makes helps a business support at least two jobs. That said, expensive, often predatory alternatives can wreak havoc on the business's finances and longevity. Each year, an estimated 79% of small businesses cannot access the capital they need to grow \u2013 representing a $100 billion gap in small business financing. These businesses need support to access the right capital for their goals and avoid predatory products.\n\nLearn with AOF helps under-resourced small business owners access capital by helping them gain greater control over their finances. \"Economic opportunity is about more than access to capital,\" says Sandy Fernandez, Vice President of Social Impact at the Center for Inclusive Growth and Head of the Mastercard Strive USA program, which is supporting the Learn with AOF initiative. \"It's also about giving underinvested small business owners access to financial knowledge, tools, and strategy needed to establish solid financial footing, plan long-term, and access responsible and affordable financial products. We are proud to partner with AOF to bring this innovative learning platform to small business owners and be a part of their bold vision to scale their lending operation over the next five years.\"\n\nLearn with AOF is the only digital financial learning platform with content created by small business owners who know what it takes to overcome the toughest financial hurdles. Informed by AOF's 30+ years of experience unlocking new opportunities for millions of business owners, the platform is free, flexible, and relevant to business owners at any stage. It simplifies \"small business finance\" into focused topics that can be learned anywhere and takes the guesswork out of where to start by placing users on customized learning paths based on their specific financial needs. As users advance through topics, they unlock free tools and templates that make it easy to put learning into practice right away.\n\nWith the launch of Learn with AOF, Accion Opportunity Fund and Mastercard Strive USA are adding momentum to the larger movement to scale and strengthen mission-driven lending nationwide.

            "content": "Creating and sticking with good habits isn\u2019t easy. It takes time and repetition and requires the kind of discipline that, for many of us, is hard to access.\n\nThat\u2019s where gamification comes in. The idea behind this strategy is that by introducing the elements of a game \u2014 competition, rewards and fun \u2014 you can motivate people to make better choices again and again until they become habits. Tech companies are using it to build tools that, for example, help kids with diabetes more efficiently manage their blood sugar by monitoring a baby dragon\u2019s blood sugar.\n\nFinancial institutions can harness this same technology to advance inclusion. As banks look for ways to build trust and encourage people to use digital tools that can help them better manage their finances, gamification is proving to be a powerful option, especially in Latin America, where account ownership and financial digitalization is growing faster than in other regions.\n\nGamification can help those new users improve their financial health and become long-term customers of banks. Studies have shown that gamification can help people financially stay on track with things like bill and loan payments, which means better credit, more financial stability and a strengthened relationship with their bank.\n\n\u201cMoving people from access to usage of financial tools can go a long way toward building a more financially inclusive world, but getting people to usage is still a challenge,\u201d says Natasha Jamal, vice president of social impact for Mastercard Strive, a global program that helps small businesses around the world to thrive in the digital economy.\n\nMaking financial services fun\n\n\u201cPart of the challenge is that in some cultures, simply talking about money can be taboo,\u201d says Pedro Moura, co-founder of Flourish Fi, a California-based fintech that combines gamification with behavioral science to increase customer loyalty and engagement with financial institutions across the Americas. That means consumers are missing the knowledge they need to embrace healthy financial habits, and banks have an opportunity to help with that financial education. When money isn\u2019t discussed, good money management can feel out of reach.\n\n\u201cThis can be as simple as paying their bills on time, building a little bit of a rainy-day fund or making smarter decisions in their financial lives,\u201d says Moura, who was the first in his family to access financial services in the U.S. after they emigrated Brazil. \u201cWe\u2019re turning that interaction from transactional into a fun element.\u201d\n\nFlourish Fi, a veteran of Mastercard\u2019s Start Path startup engagement program, aims to help banks better connect with people who are new to the banking system. Moura says the key is mixing personalized nudges with data intelligence and incentives to drive behavior. Flourish Fi uses APIs \u2014 the application programming interfaces that help software systems talk to each other \u2014 to connect with financial institution partners\u2019 apps or websites to give consumers opportunities to play games that help them improve their financial health.\n\nWhen customers log in to their account, paying bills on time might trigger a wheel of prizes for them to spin. Or they may choose settings that automatically make micro-deposits based on a beloved sports team\u2019s wins.\n\nIn partnership with a number of banks, Flourish Fi rolled out its product in Brazil and across Latin America for individuals in 2018. After using Flourish Fi, consumers increased their deposit values by 32% and their online bill payments by 26%, and they doubled their usage of partner banking apps. Banks and credit unions also benefit from the technology because it helps them strengthen customer relationships and build trust with people who might otherwise transact offline.\n\nBrazil\u2019s Banco Carrefour and Bolivia\u2019s BancoSol have found that customers log in to their app or website twice as much as they did before Flourish Fi was added, Moura says. Customers who previously saved nothing over six to eight months now save some $600 over the same period. Incentives on Flourish Fi, such as the ability to spend points earned from quiz-taking or on-time loan payments on prizes, also mean that banks\u2019 repayment levels are rising.\n\nBringing gamification to small businesses\n\nMost recently, Flourish Fi forged a partnership with Mastercard Strive to expand its service to yet another group in need: micro-entrepreneurs. These small-business owners often struggle to use digital financial services to help them meet their business goals.\n\nIn Brazil, 77% of micro-entrepreneurs have never taken a course or training in finance, according to Brazilian micro- and small-business support service Sebrae. At the same time, one in three don\u2019t check their bank account and have no record of money coming in and out of their business.\n\nThrough gamification, Flourish Fi incentivizes responsible financial business management practices like saving or investing money and paying loans and bills on time. For example, Flourish Fi helped inspire Brazilian corner store owner Maria Lourdes to digitize her business.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s top of mind for a small entrepreneur is they want to sell more and manage their time more effectively,\u201d Moura says, \u201cand we support individuals with journeys of better understanding financial services.\u201d\n\nUsing Flourish Fi, Lourdes was incentivized by personalized rewards and micro-content on ways she can bolster her business by accepting digital payments and then paying her bills with the money she\u2019s bringing in. Micro-content on the app also taught her how to further tap into financial services to enhance her business\u2019s financial health.\n\nFlourish Fi now helps 375,000 people across five countries. But there are millions of individuals like Lourdes who still need support, Moura says.\n\nIt\u2019s his hope that through continued partnerships with the private sector, Flourish Fi will foster many more individuals\u2019 and small businesses\u2019 resilience and growth by incentivizing them to make better use of digital financial services and build responsible money management habits.\n\n\u201cIf you design a more inclusive financial system, you\u2019re unlocking the dreams of millions of individuals,\u201d Moura says. \u201cPeople want to be the best version of themselves. They just need access, support and sometimes just a little bit of a reward to stick on their path.\u201d",

            "content": "Mastercard has announced plans to remove the 16-digit number from their credit and debit cards by 2030 in a move designed to stamp out identity theft and fraudulent use of cards.\n\nThe numbers currently used to identify cards will be replaced with tokenisation and biometric authentication\n\nIn 2022, Mastercard added biometric options enabling payments to be made with a smile or wave of the hand.\n\nTokenisation converts the 16-digit card number into a different number \u2013 or token \u2013 stored on your device, so card information is never shared when you tap your card or phone or make payments online.\n\nThe first rollout of these numberless cards will be through a partnership with AMP Bank, but it is expected other banks will follow in the coming 12 months.\n\nWhy card security is important\n\nThere is nothing quite like the sinking feeling after receiving a call or text from your bank asking about the legitimacy of a card transaction.\n\nIn 2023-2024 the total value of card fraud in Australia was A$868 million, up from $677.5 million the previous financial year.\n\nCredit card numbers and payment details are often exposed in major data breaches affecting large and small businesses.\n\nLate last year, the US Federal Trade Commission took action against the Marriott and Starwood Hotels for lax data security. More than 300 million customers worldwide were affected.\n\nEvent ticketing company Ticketmaster was also hacked last year. The details of several hundred million customers, including names, addresses, credit card numbers, phone numbers and payment details were illegally accessed.\n\nSo-called \u201ccard-not-present fraud\u201d, where an offender processes an unauthorised transaction without having the card in their physical possession, accounts for 92% of all card fraud in Australia. This rose 29% in the last financial year.\n\nThe Card Verification Value (CVV) (or three-digit number on the back of a credit card) aimed to ensure the person making the transaction had the physical card in their hands. But it is clearly ineffective.\n\nBenefits of removing credit card numbers\n\nRemoving the credit card number is the latest attempt to curb fraud. Removing numbers stops fraudsters processing unauthorised card-not-present transactions.\n\nIt also reduces the potential for financial damage of victims exposed in data breaches, if organisations are no longer able to store these payment details.\n\nThe storage of personal information is a contested issue. For example, the 2022 Optus data breach exposed information from customers who had previously held accounts with the telco back in 2018.\n\nRemoving the ability of organisations to store payment details in the first place, removes the risk of this information being exposed in any future attack.\n\nWhile any efforts to reduce fraud are welcome, this new approach raises some new issues to consider.\n\nPotential problems with the new system\n\nMastercard has said customers will use tokens generated by the customer\u2019s banking app or biometric authentication instead of card numbers.\n\nThis is likely to be an easy transition for customers who use mobile banking.\n\nHowever, the use of digital banking is not universal. Many senior consumers and some people with a disability don\u2019t use digital banking services. They would be excluded from the new protections.\n\nWhile strengthening the security attached to credit cards, removing numbers shifts the vulnerability to mobile phones and telecommunication providers.\n\nOffenders already access victims\u2019 phones through mobile porting and impersonation scams. These attacks are likely to escalate as new ways to exploit potential vulnerabilities are found.\n\nThere are also concerns about biometrics. Unlike credit card details, which can be replaced when exposed in a data breach, biometrics are fixed. Shifting a focus to biometrics will increase the attractiveness of this data, and potentially opens victims up to ongoing, irreversible damage.\n\nWhile not as common, breaches of biometric data do occur.\n\nFor example, web-based security platform BioStar 2 in the UK exposed the fingerprints and facial recognition details of over one million people. Closer to home, IT provider to entertainment companies Outabox is alleged to have exposed facial recognition data of more than one million Australians.\n\nWill we really need cards in the future?\n\nWhile removing the numbers may reduce credit card fraud, emerging smart retail technologies may remove the need for cards all together.\n\nSmartphone payments are already becoming the norm, removing the need for physical cards. GlobalData revealed a 58% growth in mobile wallet payments in Australia in 2023, to $146.9 billion. In October 2024, 44% of payments were \u201cdevice-present\u201d transactions.\n\nAmazon\u2019s innovative \u201cJust-Walk-Out\u201d technology has also removed the need for consumers to bring a physical credit or debit card all together.\n\nThis technology is available at more than 70 Amazon-owned stores, and at more than 85 third-party locations across the US, UK, and Australia. These include sports stadiums, airports, grocery stores, convenience stores and college campuses.\n\nThe technology uses cameras, weight sensors and a combination of advanced AI technologies to enable shoppers in physical stores make purchases without having to swipe or tap their cards at the checkout line.\n\nSuch technology is now being offered by a variety of other vendors including Trigo, Cognizant and Grabango. It is also being trialled across other international retailers, including supermarket chains Tesco and ALDI.\n\nWhile Just-Walk-Out removes the need to carry a physical card, at some point consumers still need to enter their cards details into an app. So, to avoid cards and numbers completely, smart retail tech providers are moving to biometric alternatives, like facial recognition payments.\n\nRead more: Paying with your face: what will convince consumers to use facial recognition payment technology?\n\nConsidering the speed at which smart retail and payment technology is entering the marketplace, it is likely physical credit cards, numberless or not, will soon become redundant, replaced by biometric payment options.",

The brand is inviting Little Monsters \u2014 a term for die-hard Gaga fans \u2014 to recreate the song\u2019s dance moves on TikTok, Instagram and other social platforms.\n\nThose who submit their #MastercardGagaContest routines have the chance to appear in an upcoming fan version of \u201cAbracadabra\u201d and win a trip to a Club Mayhem dance party hosted by Gaga. In addition, Mastercard will post behind-the-scenes content for \u201cMayhem\u201d on its social channels in the lead up to the March 7 release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMastercard further deepens its ties to music culture through the collaboration with Lady Gaga around her highly anticipated eighth studio album, \u201cMayhem.\u201d The video for \u201cAbracadabra,\u201d the third single, dropped Sunday night around the Grammy Awards, which saw a performance from Gaga and Bruno Mars paying tribute to the victims of the Los Angeles wildfires.\n\nPop musicians partnering with brand marketers represents a rich tradition but those types of relationships have evolved in the social media era. Mastercard is promoting the \u201cMayhem\u201d rollout by publishing a sponsored video for \u201cAbracadabra\u201d on its own social channels, as well as sharing exclusive content where Gaga discusses the creative thinking behind her typically extravagant hair, wardrobe and dance choices. Gaga worked with Parris Goebel on the choreography for \u201cAbracadabra,\u201d which has received a warm reception from listeners who view the song as a return to the pop star\u2019s over-the-top roots.\n\nMastercard is also leveraging the Gaga tie-up for its Priceless Experience platform, giving fans who submit recordings of themselves doing the \u201cAbracadabra\u201d dance on apps like TikTok and Instagram the chance to appear in a new version of the video and attend a party with Gaga. Viral TikTok video dance trends can propel song popularity, meaning Mastercard\u2019s contest may give \u201cAbracadabra\u201d an extra bump of momentum on the charts.\n\nMastercard is a long-time sponsor of the annual music awards show, along with other industry gatherings like The Brit Awards. The payments marketer also previously released an original album themed around its \u201cPriceless\u201d positioning.\n\nOther brands took advantage of the Grammys to unveil high-caliber artist collaborations.

As a result, the pillar was up 2.5%.\n\nPayment Networks Weigh In\n\nMastercard\u2019s stock gathered 4.8%.\n\nMastercard\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings results showed that consumers\u2019 gross dollar volumes were up 12% year over year (YoY) to $2.6 trillion. Within that figure, spending on debit cards surged by 10.7%, outpacing the 7.8% gain in credit card spending. The number of cards wielded by consumers and commercial clients across the globe was up 6% to 3.5 billion.\n\nDuring a conference call with analysts, CEO Michael Miebach said, \u201cThe macroeconomic environment continues to perform well, and it is underpinned by healthy consumer spending,\u201d adding, \u201cConsumers remain engaged. Affluent consumers have benefited from the wealth effect, while the mass segment remains supported by the labor market.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Miebach said that during 2024, the company tokenized 4 billion transactions per month, a rate that is 40 times higher than it was six years ago. Commercial flows represent an $80 trillion opportunity for Mastercard, given that only about $3 trillion of that spend takes place on cards, Miebach said on the call. In 2024, commercial debit and credit volumes were 13% of total gross dollar volumes, 11% higher as measured YoY.\n\nVisa, in its own earnings report, detailed that within the U.S., debit volumes were up 8% and credit volumes were 7% higher. Cross-border volumes were 15% higher in constant dollar terms.\n\nCEO Ryan McInerney said on the conference call with analysts that the quarterly volume of about $4 trillion is being driven by the shift to digital payments, which now account for more than 60% of volume.\n\nThe company has issued 4.7 billion credentials, which represented 7% growth YoY, and has also issued 12.6 billion tokens, representing a 44% surge YoY.\n\n\u201cIf you just look at eCommerce on tokenized transactions,\u201d McInerney said during the call, \u201cwe have six percentage point higher approval rates. That [translates into] significantly higher sales for our merchant partners and 30% reduction in fraud rates, which is good for everybody in the ecosystem. \u2026 Tokens have become one of our most important platforms for enabling innovation.\u201d\n\nWith a nod to the appeal of tap-to-pay functions, the CEO noted that 74% of all face-to-face transactions logged by Visa are contactless, with double-digit growth in markets such as Japan and Argentina. In the U.S., tap-to-pay was up 13 percentage points to 57%.\n\nVisa shares gathered 3.6%\n\nAffirm\u2019s stock was up 9.3%.\n\nAs PYMNTS reported, the buy now, pay later (BNPL) giant announced a newly expanded capital partnership (which dates back to 2019) with Liberty Mutual Investments, which the company said will increase consumers\u2019 access to Affirm\u2019s flexible payment options. Through June 2027, LMI will purchase Affirm\u2019s installment loans on a forward flow basis, in amounts up to $750 million outstanding. LMI expects to invest up to $5 billion in the program over time, according to the announcement late last month.\n\nLendingClub\u2019s Post-Earnings Slide\n\nThe gains in the payments pillar were offset by a slide in the Bank segment, which fell roughly 3%. The chief contributor to the slide was LendingClub, which saw its shares plummet about 21% in the wake of earnings.\n\nLast week, PYMNTS reported that LendingClub\u2019s latest quarterly results indicated growth across several key metrics, including loan originations and deposits through its digital banking arm and some improved credit metrics. However, in some cases, growth decelerated in the final quarter of the year, and forward-looking guidance sent investors to the sidelines, at least last week.\n\nConsumer loan originations in the fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, up 13% YoY. That rate is a deceleration from the 23% pace that had been seen in the most recent third-quarter earnings report. Revenues were 17% higher to $217.2 million. Deposits were up 24% YoY to $9.1 billion. In terms of guidance, the firm\u2019s first-quarter projections of loan originations in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion would represent growth of 12.5% to about 18% YoY.\n\nCFO Drew LaBenne said on the call that marketing expenses will increase, adding that with the first quarter guidance, \u201cWe are gaining confidence that the sustained sales price improvements in the marketplace will allow us to open up additional paid marketing channels as we enter the seasonally favorable second and third quarters. We expect to be able to continue growing loan volumes as we move through the year,\u201d and the fourth quarter of the year may see originations about 25% above current levels.\n\nPre-provision net revenue guidance for the current quarter of $60 million to $70 million was, as one analyst noted on the call, a bit below consensus of about $73 million. That number would be impacted by increased marketing spend, according to management commentary.\n\nTesla lost about 1%, and FedEx gave up 3%, as the Move segment slipped 1.4%.\n\nIn its most recent earnings report, Tesla reported a 70% decrease in net income compared to the same period in 2023. The firm reported 495,570 cars delivered for Q4 and 1.8 million deliveries for the fiscal year, Tesla\u2019s first annual decline in meeting delivery targets. The company remains adamant that greater affordability will drive mass adoption, but whether it can sustain its margins remains a critical question for investors, PYMNTS reported.",

            "content": "Porter Airlines, BMO, and Mastercard Launch New Travel Credit Card A Game Changer for Canadian Travelers with Enhanced Rewards and Exclusive Benefits\n\nA new partnership between Porter Airlines, BMO Financial Group (Bank of Montreal), and Mastercard has resulted in the creation of a new travel credit card aimed at enhancing travel opportunities for Canadian consumers. The card, known as the BMO VIPorter Mastercard, is set to launch in the spring of 2025. This exciting collaboration is designed to offer a range of rewards and benefits to Canadian travelers, allowing them to earn and redeem points faster through everyday purchases. With Porter Airlines\u2019 growing network and increasing partnerships with global airlines, this new credit card offers a significant step in boosting travel convenience for Canadians.\n\nBoosting Travel Rewards for Canadian Travelers\n\nThe BMO VIPorter Mastercard is a unique credit card program tailored to frequent travelers, with the primary goal of offering enhanced rewards for those who choose to fly with Porter Airlines and its expanding network of airline partners. According to the companies involved, the new credit card allows cardholders to accumulate VIPorter points faster, which can then be redeemed for flights through everyday purchases.\n\nThis strategic collaboration not only benefits customers by making it easier to earn rewards, but it also seeks to encourage more travel within North America and beyond. By offering VIPorter points with every purchase, the card aims to provide users with the opportunity to gain points even when they\u2019re not directly flying, making it more convenient for travelers to enjoy the benefits of their travel rewards.\n\nKey Features of the New Credit Card\n\nOne of the standout features of the BMO VIPorter Mastercard is its focus on providing faster point redemption, with no blackout dates. As the network of Porter Airlines continues to expand, this means more opportunities for cardholders to redeem their points for flights on various routes, making it easier for travelers to plan their next journey. The card will allow users to redeem any seat available across Porter\u2019s network and those of its growing global airline partners, making travel more accessible to an even broader audience.\n\nMoreover, for those who spend a minimum of USD 3,000 annually, customers can also earn PorterReserve flight certifications, which provide access to premium services, further enhancing the value of the new travel credit card.\n\nStrategic Partnerships Between Porter, BMO, and Mastercard\n\nThis collaboration between Porter Airlines, BMO Financial Group, and Mastercard is built on the shared goal of providing a seamless and rewarding travel experience for Canadians. Porter Airlines, a prominent player in the Canadian airline industry, was founded in 2006 and currently operates 32 destinations with a fleet of 72 aircraft. The airline has earned a reputation for elevating economy class travel and providing top-notch services to its passengers.\n\nBMO Financial Group is one of the largest banks in North America, with total assets amounting to USD 1.41 trillion. Their involvement in this partnership will bring added expertise in the financial sector, enabling the credit card program to offer a seamless experience for users. Mastercard, a global leader in payment processing, will also provide its vast network and technology to make the payment process safe, secure, and easy for travelers.\n\nThe Impact on Canadian Travel and the Global Travel Industry\n\nThis new credit card program is poised to have a significant impact on both the Canadian travel market and the broader global travel industry. For Canadian travelers, the BMO VIPorter Mastercard offers a more convenient way to earn and redeem travel rewards, which could lead to an increase in travel bookings with Porter Airlines and its network. This increase in bookings could further fuel the growth of Porter Airlines\u2019 domestic and international presence.\n\nThe launch of the new credit card also signifies a trend of growing collaboration between airlines, financial institutions, and payment providers. As more companies seek to enhance the travel experience for customers, this type of collaboration will likely become more common in the future. The convenience and benefits offered through these strategic partnerships could lead to a ripple effect across the global travel industry, with more airlines and financial institutions exploring similar partnerships.\n\nA Look Ahead: The Future of Travel Loyalty Programs\n\nLooking ahead, the BMO VIPorter Mastercard is set to revolutionize how travelers earn and use their rewards. As the program continues to evolve, it may set a new standard for loyalty programs in the travel industry, offering customers even more value and flexibility in their travel experiences. The increasing demand for travel and more personalized experiences could inspire other companies in the sector to innovate and create better offerings for travelers, resulting in a more dynamic and rewarding global travel landscape.\n\nShare On:",

            "content": "A handful of \"alternative\" credit cards \u2014 generally products from startup financial technology companies (\"fintechs\") \u2014 are exploring different ways of evaluating creditworthiness beyond traditional FICO scores and credit history. Among such products, the Grow Credit Mastercard stands out.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nOffered by the Grow Credit startup and issued by Sutton Bank, the card allows customers to choose a membership plan that helps them build credit through qualifying subscriptions or bill payments. This is not an option found on typical credit cards.\n\nOther noteworthy features include:\n\nNo security deposit for most membership plans.\n\nNo interest charges.\n\nNo credit check.\n\nGiven its unique structure, the card does have some limitations that may not be a match for everyone. For instance, you won't be able to carry a balance, and your spending power will be low and restricted.\n\nPlus, no matter which membership tier you choose, you'll owe a monthly fee.\n\nHere\u2019s are five things to know about the Grow Credit Mastercard.\n\nTrying to get approved for a card? Create a NerdWallet account for insight on your credit score and personalized recommendations for the right card for you. GET STARTED\n\n1. There's no hard credit check, but you must link a bank account\n\nThere will be a \"soft\" credit check for identification purposes, which won't affect your credit scores. But instead of relying on a hard inquiry on your credit reports \u2014 which is common among most credit card companies when they evaluate applications \u2014 Grow Credit has its own proprietary technology that can look at income to determine creditworthiness, according to Joe Bayen, CEO and founder of Grow Credit.\n\nOne way the company does this is by requiring access to your bank account information through Plaid, a third-party service.\n\nThe lack of a credit check makes the card ideal for those with no credit or poor credit (FICO scores of 629 or below) who want to establish a credit history without the risk of taking on debt.\n\n2. You can build credit by paying monthly bills \u2014 but the card itself charges one, too\n\nPayment for subscription services isn\u2019t generally factored into your credit reports, but here's how the Grow Credit Mastercard makes it work:\n\nIt offers a traditional line of credit that allows you to establish credit as you pay for qualifying monthly subscriptions that include eligible bills, TV, music and other streaming services. You pay off the bill in full each month and build credit in the process.\n\nThe virtual card is tied to one of several membership plans that include secured and non-secured options, depending on your eligibility. These plans allow you to build credit with qualifying subscriptions, each with a different limit. The pricing of membership plans may vary with different promotions. The company will let you know which plans you\u2019re eligible for, and you can make the final selection, but the membership tiers are as follows for the non-secured plans:\n\n\"Build\" membership (free for the first 12 months): This plan offers a $17 monthly spending limit on subscriptions like Netflix, Hulu, Spotify and Pandora, to name a few. After 12 months, you'll pay $3.99 per month for this plan.\n\n\"Grow\" membership ($6.99 per month): The Grow membership offers a $50 monthly spending limit and access to \u201cpremium\u201d subscriptions that include payments at Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Coursera.\n\n\"Accelerate\" membership ($12.99 per month): This plan offers a $150 monthly spending limit toward these same premium subscriptions.\n\nFor the secured plans, the monthly cost can vary slightly and you'll be required to put down a deposit amount. You can get the deposit back after 12 months of on-time payments or after closing the account.\n\nThe extensive list of eligible subscriptions includes AT&T, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, T Mobile, Spotify, among others.\n\nAmong these plans, the \"Build\" plan is the best option if you qualify. Otherwise, you\u2019re paying an annual cost of about $84 for the Grow membership plan and nearly $156 for the Accelerate membership plan. (Prices may vary with different promotions.) In that case, you\u2019re better off saving up to pay the security deposit on a secured credit card elsewhere because you can get that money back after you close the card if you maintain a good payment history.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Another alternative card, the Chime Secured Credit Builder Visa\u00ae Credit Card \u2014 doesn\u2019t require a steep security deposit upfront, but it requires a Chime Checking Account to qualify.\n\nSee more from Chime\u00ae Chime says the following: The secured Chime Credit Builder Visa\u00ae Credit Card is issued by The Bancorp Bank, N.A. or Stride Bank, N.A., pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. and may be used everywhere Visa credit cards are accepted. Please see the back of your card for its issuing bank.\n\nTo apply for Credit Builder, you must have an active Chime\u00ae Checking Account. Based on a representative study conducted by Experian\u00ae in January 2024, members who made their first purchase with Credit Builder between June 2022 and October 2022 observed an average FICO\u00ae Score 8 increase of 30 points after approximately 8 months. On-time payment history can have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score. On-time payment history may have a positive impact on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score. Chime will report your activities to Transunion\u00ae, Experian\u00ae, and Equifax\u00ae. Impact on your credit may vary, as Credit scores are independently determined by credit bureaus based on a number of factors including the financial decisions you make with other financial services organizations. Money added to Credit Builder will be held in a secured deposit account as collateral for your Credit Builder Visa card, and you can spend up to this amount. You can use money deposited in your Secured Deposit Account to pay off your charges at the end of every month. Out-of-network ATM withdrawal and over the counter advance fees may apply except at MoneyPass ATMs in a 7-Eleven, or any Allpoint or Visa Plus Alliance ATM.\n\n3. It has a low spending limit and other restrictions\n\nThe monthly spending limit on the Grow Credit Mastercard can only be used to pay for subscriptions included in your membership plan.\n\nThe monthly spending limit is different for each membership plan, but it\u2019s only a fraction of the card\u2019s credit limit. For instance, with the free membership plan, you can only spend up to $17 per month, but your limit on the card is $204.\n\nA $17 limit might be enough to cover (maybe) one subscription. To get a higher limit, you'll have to pay for a higher membership tier with Grow Credit.\n\n4. You can\u2019t carry a balance, so there\u2019s no APR\n\nWith the Grow Credit Mastercard, carrying a balance from one month to another is impossible. You can only charge the eligible subscriptions to the card up to your available monthly spending limit. As a result, Grow Credit charges no interest. Grow Credit makes its money through interchange fees and the cost of the paid membership plans.\n\nSince you\u2019re required to pay on time and in full, you're far less likely to fall into a debt cycle with this card. Its sole purpose is to help you build credit. Note, however, that you will owe a monthly membership fee.\n\n5. It reports to all three credit bureaus\n\nPayments are reported to all three major credit bureaus \u2014 TransUnion, Equifax and Experian \u2014 which are the companies that record the information used to calculate your credit scores.\n\nPayments are reported as a revolving line of credit. Previously, they were reported as an installment loan. A card that reports payments to all major credit bureaus is a must-have when building credit is your goal.",

            "content": "NerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nThe Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card is currently the only credit card that lets you earn travel rewards on your monthly rent payment without tacking on extra fees. The annual fee is $0, and there\u2019s no transaction fee for paying rent and no foreign transaction fees for using the card abroad.\n\nEven better, Bilt Rewards earned on rent payments and through daily use of the card can be redeemed in a variety of ways, including a 1:1 transfer to more than 15 airline and hotel loyalty programs.\n\nHowever, the card isn\u2019t without drawbacks. There's no introductory welcome bonus, and you won\u2019t earn rewards on the card unless you use it at least five times per month. While the card\u2019s dining and travel bonus categories are useful, it does take a little bit of planning to optimize.\n\nHere\u2019s how to decide if the Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card is right for you.\n\nTravel Rewards Expert Reveals... Why this is her top credit card for dining rewards, and she shows you exactly how she realizes more than $1,000 in value from it each year. Click for details\n\nQuick facts\n\nAnnual fee: None.\n\nSign-up bonus: None.\n\nRewards:\n\n5 Bilt Points per $1 spent on Lyft (when you link your accounts).\n\n3 points per $1 spent on dining.\n\n2 points per $1 spent on travel.\n\n1 point per $1 spent on rent (up to 100,000 points per calendar year).\n\n1 point per $1 spent on other purchases.\n\n(You must use the card 5 times each statement period to earn points. If you do not make at least 5 transactions in a statement period you\u2019ll earn a flat 250 points when you use your Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card to pay rent through the Bilt app or website.)\n\nForeign transaction fee: None.\n\nOther benefits:\n\nPrimary auto damage collision damage waiver: Applies when you pay for the rental car with the card. (New York residents are eligible only for secondary coverage.)\n\nCell phone protection: Up to $800 in coverage, with a $25 deductible, if you pay your cell phone bill with the card.\n\nTrip cancellation/interruption protection: Up to $5,000 reimbursement for a covered reason when you pay for travel with the card.\n\nLyft credits: Receive a $5 Lyft credit each month after you pay for three rides with your card.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: What to know about paying rent with a credit card\n\nThe Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card is worth getting if\u2026\n\n1. You pay rent\n\nPayment processors such as Plastiq and Venmo have long allowed credit card holders to charge rental payments, but those services charge a fee of around 3% of the transaction amount. That fee largely offsets the value of any rewards earned, curbing the benefit of paying rent by card in the first place.\n\nBut with the Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card, you can earn 1 point per dollar spent on rent, up to an annual cap of 100,000 points per year.\n\nThe annual fee is also $0, so there\u2019s no calculus to determine how many rewards you\u2019d have to earn on the card to make it worth holding.\n\n2. You want access to travel partners\n\nIt\u2019s rare to find a no-annual-fee card that earns transferable travel rewards. But that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ll get with Bilt Rewards, which can be transferred to over 15 airline and hotel programs, including Hyatt, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines.\n\nTransferring credit card rewards to travel partners can give outsize value. For example, NerdWallet values Hyatt points at 2.2 cents each. If you dine out and earn three points per dollar when you pay with your Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card, that\u2019s an approximate return of 6.6% when you transfer points to Hyatt.\n\nAdditionally, Bilt frequently offers transfer bonuses when you send your Bilt Rewards to a travel transfer partner. For example, in 2024, Alaska Airlines offered up to a 100% transfer bonus depending on your status with Bilt Rewards. That means 25,000 Bilt Rewards could turn into 50,000 Alaska Mileage Plan miles.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: The best travel credit cards right now\n\n3. You dine out, travel or use Lyft\n\nBeyond rent payments, the Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card has some potentially useful bonus categories. Cardholders will receive an uncapped 5 points per dollar spent on Lyft, 3 points per dollar spent at restaurants, 2 points per dollar spent on travel and 1 point on everything else. You\u2019ll also get $5 in Lyft credits when you take three eligible rides in a month with this card.\n\nThere\u2019s a nice synergy between these bonus categories, as people who travel frequently are also likely to dine out and use rideshare apps. Using your card on these purchases will also help knock out the five monthly transactions required to earn rewards on the card, including on rent payments.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip In addition to credit card rewards, Lyft users can earn bonus travel rewards by linking their airline or hotel loyalty accounts with Lyft.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: The best credit cards for restaurants\n\n4. You pay your bills on the first of the month\n\nThe Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card offers double rewards for qualifying transactions made on the first day of each month (\u201cRent Day\u201d), up to 1,000 bonus points per month. That\u2019s a potential bonus of 12,000 points per year. Unfortunately, rent payments don\u2019t qualify for double rewards.\n\nA straightforward strategy for maximizing that Rent Day bonus is to wait and pay your recurring bills, such as utilities, cell phone or car insurance, until the first of the month. Not only will you earn 2 points per dollar spent, but those transactions will qualify for the five monthly transactions required to earn rewards on your card.\n\nPurchases made in bonus categories also earn double rewards on the first month, so you\u2019ll earn 10 points per dollar spent on Lyft rides, 6 points on dining and 4 points on travel purchases.\n\n5. You travel frequently\n\nThe Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card offers cardholders several travel protections typically reserved for more premium cards, including a primary collision damage waiver on car rentals, trip cancellation and interruption coverage and trip delay reimbursement.\n\nThe primary collision damage waiver can be a big deal if you get into an accident since the card\u2019s insurance policy will apply before your personal auto insurance policy. That can save you future rate increases for your personal insurance policy. To qualify, just pay for the rental car with your Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card and decline the rental company\u2019s insurance. (Note that New York residents receive secondary coverage, not primary.) This coverage is available worldwide except in Israel, Jamaica, the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland.\n\nTravel booked with your card is covered for qualifying cancellations or interruptions up to either $5,000 per traveler per trip, or the actual amount charged to your card (whichever is less). Eligibility includes a cancellation or interruption from death, disease or an accidental bodily injury, death of a family member and financial insolvency.\n\nTrip delay reimbursement allows you to recoup expenses incurred if your trip is delayed by six hours or more. You\u2019re covered by $200 per day per traveler for up to three days and a maximum of $1,800 for all covered travelers per trip (including your spouse, domestic partner or dependent children).\n\n6. You want cell phone insurance\n\nThe Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card is issued by Wells Fargo, which offers cell phone protection on all of its consumer credit cards. To qualify, pay your monthly cell phone bill with your card and you\u2019ll be covered up to $800 (after a $25 deductible) for damage and theft to your phone.\n\nThe Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card is not worth getting if\u2026\n\n1. You don\u2019t rent\n\nThe primary value proposition of the Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card is the ability to pay rent and earn rewards without any fees. Sure, the card offers other travel benefits and useful bonus categories. But if you don\u2019t rent, you won\u2019t be able to take advantage of the easiest way to stack Bilt Rewards.\n\n2. You won\u2019t use the card 5x per month\n\nThe Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card can be a rewards-earning machine for the right person. However, the card requires you to make five transactions per calendar month to earn any rewards. If you don\u2019t remember to hit those five transactions, you\u2019ll lose any pending rewards for that month. While five transactions is relatively painless, it might still takes some effort to remember to use the card.\n\n3. You don\u2019t travel\n\nThe Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card packs a lot of benefits into a $0-annual-fee card. But if you don\u2019t travel, many of those benefits may go unused. In this case, you\u2019d probably be better off with a cash-back card, though you may not be able to earn rewards on your rent payment.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: The best cash back credit cards\n\n4. You want a welcome offer\n\nMany credit cards offer new cardholders a slug of rewards to entice them to get the card. However, you won\u2019t get a welcome offer with the Bilt World Elite Mastercard. The ability to earn rewards on rent payments can more than make up for that, but if you\u2019re not a renter, you may do better with a different travel card.\n\nAlternatives to the Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card\n\nThe Bilt World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit Card offers great travel benefits and value for travelers, but that value is diminished if you redeem your rewards for a statement credit. If you'd rather have cash back, you can get a better return on spending from cards like the Chase Freedom Flex\u00ae or the Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card, both of which charge no annual fee and offer a welcome bonus.",

Complete with 40 dancers, Gaga\u2019s trademark facial dramatics and her penchant for jaw-dropping high fashion, the \u201cAbracadabra\u201d clip also evoked her timeless \u201cBad Romance\u201d music video in its meticulous display of the intersection of several different modes of art.\n\n\u201cAbracadabra\u201d is the third of three Mayhem songs Gaga has revealed so far. Last summer, she debuted the Mars-assisted \u201cDie With a Smile,\u201d which topped the Billboard Hot 100 this year and earned Grammy nominations for song of the year and best pop duo/group performance. Two months later, Mother Monster dropped \u201cDisease,\u201d a dark electro-pop banger that reached No. 27 on the Hot 100.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nOn Jan. 27, Gaga confirmed that Mayhem, her newest studio album, would arrive March 7. Though the LP will mark Gaga\u2019s first original full-length pop album since 2020\u2019s Grammy-winning Chromatica, the \u201cShallow\u201d singer hasn\u2019t been completely musically absent in the interim. In 2021, she won two Grammys alongside the late Tony Bennett for their Love for Sale joint album, and last year she topped Jazz Albums with Harlequin \u2014 a soundtrack album inspired by her character from 2024\u2019s box office-topping Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, for which she earned a Razzie nod for worst actress.\n\nIt\u2019s been a busy weekend for Gaga. On Thursday (Jan. 30), she closed FireAid with a brand new song, and Saturday Night Live confirmed that she\u2019ll headline the Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Concert on Feb. 14 alongside Miley Cyrus and Bad Bunny. Come April, Gaga will also have headlined Coachella for a second time.\n\nWatch Lady Gaga\u2019s new \u201cAbracadabra\u201d music video below.",

While this new offer does charge a $99 annual fee, the additional miles should more than make up for it. (h/t: DDG)\n\nThe Offer & Key Card Details\n\nQuick Thoughts\n\nThis new offer is just shy of the best that we\u2019ve seen for time on the Aviator Red, and it awards 10,000 more bonus miles than the previous public offer \u2013 and one purchase is as low as it gets for minimum spend. Our current reasonable redemption values have AAdvantage Miles at 1.3cpp, giving this offer a total value of ~$800-900\u2026a great return for effectively no spend.\n\nFor those playing the AA Loyalty Games for elite status, it\u2019s worth noting that the bonus miles you earn here will not earn a corresponding number of Loyalty Points. However, your base spend on the card does earn you 1 Loyalty Point per dollar and so cards like these can still help you towards AAdvantage status (although at sub-optimal return).\n\nBarclays Application Tips",

Factors in our evaluation methodology include each card\u2019s earning rates, rewards structure (such as flat-rate or bonus categories), annual fee, redemption options, promotional APR period for purchases, bonus offers for new cardholders, and noteworthy features such as insurance, loyalty bonuses or the ability to choose one\u2019s own rewards categories.\n\nHow no-fee credit cards work in Canada\n\nWhat is a no-fee credit card?\n\nA no-fee credit card doesn\u2019t have an annual fee: the lump sum amount charged by card issuers to help cover the cost of card rewards and programs. Most of the best Canadian credit cards carry annual fees over $100.\n\nNow, this isn\u2019t to say you won\u2019t ever pay any fees while holding a no-free credit card \u2014 you\u2019ll likely still need to deal with interest charges, inactivity fees and the like. But annual fees? No-fee cards don\u2019t have any, which could help you trim down on unnecessary costs.\n\nThe only downside? No-fee cards may not offer the same premium perks that often accompany cards with steep annual fees. That said, no-fee cards still have some perks, including cash-back reward programs, travel points and more.\n\nCommon features of a no-fee credit card\n\nEvery no-fee credit card is unique, so the included features will differ. That said, here are some of the common features you may get:\n\nInterest-free grace period.\n\nFraud protection.\n\nIncreased earn rate on some merchant categories.\n\nRewards (cash back, travel, store, etc).\n\nPurchase protection.\n\nExtended warranty.\n\nAdmittedly, no-fee credit cards often have fewer benefits than credit cards with an annual fee. But some no-fee credit cards may still include helpful perks, such as mobile device protection or travel insurance.\n\nIs a no-fee credit card a free credit card?\n\nA no-fee card isn\u2019t exactly the same as a free credit card. While no-fee credit cards don\u2019t charge you an annual fee, there will likely be other costs associated with using a no-fee card, including:\n\nAll of these additional fees should be clearly outlined in the terms and conditions that come with your card. As long as you use your no-fee credit card responsibly, it may be possible to avoid fees completely.\n\nDo no-fee credit cards still earn rewards?\n\nYes, there are many no-fee credit cards that earn rewards. The type of rewards you\u2019ll receive depends on what card you choose. The typical rewards categories are as follows:\n\nNo-fee cash back cards earn a percentage back in cash on purchases.\n\nNo-fee travel cards earn airline, hotel or even general travel rewards points.\n\nCo-branded no-fee store and retail cards earn store or retail rewards that can be redeemed at participating stores for groceries, merchandise and more.\n\nTypes of no-fee credit cards in Canada\n\nMany types of no-fee credit cards are available, with the best offering the ability to earn valuable rewards, cash back and more, all without having to pay an annual fee.\n\nNo-fee cash back credit cards\n\nCash-back credit cards are fairly simple as far as perks are concerned: spend money; get a percentage of what you\u2019ve spent back in cash. Now, as for the type of purchases that earn rewards and how much cash back you get for them, that\u2019s what separates different types of cash-back cards.\n\nTake the Simplii Financial\u2122 Cash Back Visa Card: it\u2019s a no-fee cash back card that offers 4% cash back each time you swipe your card at a restaurant, bar or coffee shop, up to $5,000 per year.\n\nIn comparison, the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card offers unlimited cash back at a 2% rate in up to three money-back categories of your choice.\n\nNo-fee travel credit cards\n\nTravel cards offer travel-related rewards when you use your card. Some travel cards charge large annual fees in exchange for premium perks, like comprehensive travel insurance packages.\n\nBut the rewards offered by no-fee travel credit cards are nothing to sneeze at. The CIBC Aeroplan\u00ae Visa Card doesn\u2019t carry an annual fee and earns Aeroplan points every time you spend on gas, groceries and Air Canada travel purchases, for example.\n\nAnd the BMO AIR MILES\u00ae\u2020 Mastercard\u00ae*, another no-fee card, earns Air Miles rewards and comes with car rental discounts.\n\nNo-fee rewards cards\n\nRewards cards allow you to earn points for making eligible purchases. And these points can be redeemed for all types of perks, from travel vouchers to electronic gift cards.\n\nFor example, the American Express\u00ae Green Card lets you earn rewards points across a variety of spending categories and points can be put towards purchases, travel spending, gift cards; you name it. Plus, you can transfer points to other loyalty programs, like Aeroplan and Marriott Bonvoy.\n\nNo-fee Mastercards\n\nCredit cards branded with the Mastercard name or logo belong to the Mastercard network. Mastercard is not a card issuer, it simply processes credit card payments. And because Mastercard is one of the most popular card processors in the world, there are plenty of cards to pick from \u2014 including cards without annual fees.\n\nOne example of a no-fee Mastercard with generous perks is the Brim Mastercard. It earns rewards points on everyday purchases, offers free global WiFi access and comes with travel, event ticket and mobile device insurance coverage.\n\nWho should get a no-fee credit card?\n\nA no-fee card may not be suitable for everyone, depending on their spending habits and financial goals, but there are some circumstances in which this type of card is a practical fit:\n\nYou\u2019re building your credit history. When you begin building your credit history, a card with a high annual fee may not be helpful. No-fee cards are free to carry, so they can help you focus on building your credit without having to worry about whether you\u2019re using your card often enough to justify the annual cost.\n\nYou don\u2019t use your card that often. Getting a card with an annual fee makes sense if you\u2019re able to earn more than you pay \u2014 but this tends to require more frequent use and thousands of dollars in spending. If you only anticipate using your credit card for the odd infrequent purchase, a no-fee card may be more practical.\n\nYou\u2019re seeking a secondary card. Maybe you\u2019ve already got a credit card, but you want a secondary card to double down on the points-earning process. A no-fee card might be the way to go. Or, maybe you\u2019d like a Visa to compliment your Mastercard \u2014 or vice versa. Not all merchants accept both.\n\nAdvantages of no-fee credit cards\n\nNo annual fee. As long as you\u2019re paying your balance in full and on time each month, it doesn\u2019t cost you anything to have the card.\n\nYou can keep your account open for a long time. Since it doesn\u2019t cost anything to keep the card active, your total available credit will grow, which has a positive effect on your credit utilization \u2014 one of the biggest factors in your credit score.\n\nGood for emergencies. No-fee credit cards are low-cost and low-maintenance, so they make for an excellent backup credit card.\n\nHelps you build credit. Using your credit card responsibly will build your credit history and credit score.\n\nEarn rewards. You can earn points or miles that can later be redeemed for travel or merchandise.\n\nDisadvantages of no-fee credit cards\n\nLimited benefits. Credit cards that charge an annual fee often have better benefits and higher reward earn rates.\n\nSmaller welcome bonus. No-fee cards usually have a less generous sign-up offer compared to cards with a fee.\n\nCan create high-interest debt. As with all credit cards, you could go into debt if you don\u2019t manage your spending.\n\nWhen is an annual fee worth paying?\n\nAnnual fees for Canadian credit cards can range from $6.95 to $699, and the cost may be worthwhile \u2014 it really all depends on your financial situation, lifestyle and spending habits.\n\nFor example: a travel credit card with an annual fee may be a practical fit if you\u2019re often on the road and frequently purchase travel insurance \u2014 a perk offered by numerous travel rewards cards.\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s a cash-back credit card with an annual fee that offers bonus rewards for something you spend a lot of money on, like gas or groceries.\n\nEssentially, a credit card\u2019s annual fee is worth it if the amount of value (savings or rewards) you can squeeze from the card each year is higher than the amount of the fee.\n\nHow to choose a no-fee credit card\n\nWhen comparing credit cards, assessing the annual fee they charge is typically important. Of course, with no-fee cards, this isn\u2019t a concern. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re all the same. Here are some other things to consider when deciding between no-fee credit cards in Canada.\n\nInterest rate\n\nAll credit cards \u2014 even no-fee cards \u2014 charge interest and those interest rates should factor into the card you choose. The no-fee cards on our list carry an average purchase interest rate of 20.2%, which is pretty standard. The average interest rate for a Canadian credit card in any category is 19.4%, but cards with lower rates exist, some under 10%. They\u2019re rare, but they\u2019re out there.\n\nIf you tend to carry a balance on your card, keep your eyes peeled for no-fee cards with lower interest rates \u2014 anything under 20% is a competitive rate in this category.\n\nWelcome bonus or intro offer\n\nIntroductory offers often come in the form of special cash-back offers or extra rewards points. They\u2019re designed to help incentivize new card applications and could be a factor worth considering as you narrow down your no-fee credit card options.\n\nThe caveat to welcome bonuses? You don\u2019t always get the points or cash just for signing up. To nab the intro offer, you may have to spend a minimum amount within a certain time frame after opening the card, for example. The thing to note about welcome bonuses or intro offers is that they\u2019re typically temporary, often ending after a few months.\n\nOngoing rewards rate\n\nWhen comparing no-fee card options, take a look at what type of rewards the card will earn even after the intro offer expires \u2014 more specifically, how they\u2019re earned and ways they can be redeemed.\n\nWhether you earn points from affiliated travel programs or cold hard cash back on eligible purchases, you\u2019ll want a rewards program that will encourage you to make the most of your spending.\n\nPerhaps even more important, however, is how points are earned. One card may offer triple the points on your weekly grocery bill, while another may let you double down on your travel miles each time you book a flight with a qualifying carrier.\n\nCredit card insurance\n\nSome no-fee credit cards come with insurance coverage, but not all. Insurance coverage offerings may include travel insurance, event ticket protection, extended warranty and purchase security protection and more.\n\nInsurance coverage through your no-fee credit card may not be a strict necessity if you have coverage through an independent insurer or through your employer. But it can offer added protection and peace of mind, depending on the coverage available.\n\nHow to apply for a no-fee credit card\n\nTo apply for a no-fee credit card in Canada, you\u2019ll first need to ensure that you meet the issuer\u2019s eligibility requirements, and then follow the typical steps to submit an application.\n\nEligibility requirements for a no-fee credit card\n\nEligibility criteria may vary, but the baseline requirements for a no-fee credit card tend to be fairly standard.\n\nAge and residency status\n\nYou must be a Canadian resident, and you must be the age of majority in the province or territory you live in.\n\nCredit score\n\nAll of the no-fee cards on our list require applicants to have a Canadian credit file, so if this is your first credit card, you may need to explore other options, like getting a secured credit card, instead.\n\nMinimum credit score thresholds may also come into play, depending on the card you choose.\n\nPersonal or household income requirements\n\nIncome requirements tend to be more common among high-tier credit cards, while no-fee credit card income requirements tend to be much lower, if they\u2019re required at all.\n\nSteps to apply for a no-fee credit card\n\nWhen you apply for a no-fee credit card, there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll be approved. The credit card provider needs to assess your financial profile to determine if you\u2019re creditworthy. The application process will typically look something like this:\n\nFill out an application. This can be done online or at your financial institution. The application will ask for some basic information, such as your name, date of birth, address, social insurance number, employer and income. Your information is checked. The credit card issuer will make an inquiry on your credit report and verify the information that you provided. A decision is made. If you apply online, instant approval (or disapproval) is possible, but there\u2019s also a chance the credit card issuer will ask you to contact them to provide additional information. Your card is mailed out. Your credit card will immediately be mailed out and will typically arrive within 14 business days. Activate your card. Once your card arrives, you\u2019ll need to activate it by logging into your account or calling the number on your card. Once activated, you can use your card to make purchases.\n\nCan you get a no annual fee credit card with bad credit?\n\nIt depends on your situation.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a student, some financial institutions will approve you for a no-fee student credit card even if you don\u2019t have much credit history.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have a bad credit score due to previous financial difficulties, you may not be approved for a traditional no-fee credit card. However, you may still get another type of credit card.\n\nYou would likely still qualify for a no-fee secured credit card. These types of credit cards are similar to regular credit cards, but you need to deposit security funds. These funds act as your credit limit, but you can\u2019t use them to pay your card balance.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other beginner-friendly stocks.\n\nHeadlines from the US Stock Market\n\nUncertainty sweeps across the US with the incoming administration\u2019s potential policies. Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve has decided to pause its rate-cutting cycle and the decision to resume easing is doubtful amidst Trump\u2019s trade policies which are being deemed inflationary. Tariffs on foreign imports are considered a risk of reviving inflation. According to Reuters, Dustin Reid, chief strategist of fixed income at Mackenzie Investments in Toronto, reiterated the uncertainty looming as follows:\n\n\u201cEverything that is going on right now, from economic data to markets news and tariffs, adds up to a lot more uncertainty across all markets\u201d\n\nRecently, technology stocks benefitting from the business potential of AI witnessed a deep shock as Chinese startup DeepSeek revealed a large language model that can compete with American AI giants but at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI\u2019s, Google\u2019s, or Meta\u2019s popular AI models. DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it claims took only two months and less than $6 to build.\n\nThe event raised a lot of concerns over America\u2019s leadership in the AI sector and how big tech giants are investing heavily in AI models and data centers while DeepSeek somehow developed a highly competitive model without having as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers, as pointed out by Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James. While the US has been trying to limit China\u2019s access to the chips powering advanced AI systems, the news about DeepSeek\u2019s chatbot making it to most-downloaded free app in the US on Apple\u2019s App Store demonstrates the country\u2019s rapid gains in the sector.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds, we used a consensus of similar rankings as well as blue-chip ETFs. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a global payment technology solutions company that serves consumers, small and medium businesses, government and public sector, large enterprises, as well as banks and credit unions. Mastercard\u2019s purpose revolves around powering an inclusive digital economy that tends to benefit all.\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) serves as a payments industry leader with differentiated solutions and a broad network reach. The company has been making payments smarter and safer for more than 50 years. The company continues to benefit from market trends underscoring its opportunities within payments and services such as accelerated digitization, demands for instant and personalized experiences, scaling of digital public infrastructure, and acceleration of AI adoption among others.\n\nWith net revenue growth of 14% year-over-year, the company closed a strong Q4 of 2024. This was driven by growth in Mastercard\u2019s (NYSE:MA) payment network and its value-added services and solutions. Payment network net revenue increased 13% and value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 16%, over the year. The management remains confident in the firm\u2019s diverse capabilities in payments and services and solutions, positioning it well for long-term growth. Recently, Arvind Ramnani from Piper Sandler maintained a Buy rating on the stock, setting the price target of $591.\n\nOverall, MA ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds.

Factors in our evaluation methodology include each card\u2019s earning rates, rewards structure (such as flat-rate or bonus categories), annual fee, redemption options, promotional APR period for purchases, bonus offers for new cardholders, and noteworthy features such as insurance, loyalty bonuses or the ability to choose one\u2019s own rewards categories.\n\nHow cash-back credit cards work in Canada\n\nBefore deciding which cash-back credit card is right for you, it\u2019s helpful to understand how the cash-back redemption process works, the many categories cash-back rewards can fall into, and how cash-back cards compare to other types of credit cards.\n\nWhat is a cash-back credit card?\n\nCash-back credit cards are pretty straightforward: you use them as you would any other credit card, and in exchange for making eligible purchases, you get a certain percentage of what you\u2019ve spent back in cash.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of a cash-back credit card?\n\nAdvantages\n\nSimplicity \u2014 cash-back cards make it easy to earn valuable rewards.\n\nWelcome bonuses and introductory offers can be quite generous.\n\nAccumulated rewards can help pay down your card balance.\n\nHigh earn rates for items you buy regularly can yield big rewards.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nYou may not typically buy items that yield above-average earn rates.\n\nAmassing rewards can be slow depending on how much you spend each month, and whether you pay your bill in full.\n\nBonus and introductory offers tend to come with conditions, including spending minimums, which may be challenging to meet.\n\nShould I choose cash-back or rewards points?\n\nTypes of cash-back credit cards\n\nAll cash-back credit cards work similarly, but even minor differences are worth noting as they can affect your earn rate.\n\nFlat-rate\n\nThis type of cash-back credit card earns cash-back at the same rate for all purchases made.\n\nBonus rewards categories\n\nSome cash-back credit cards offer an increased earn rate for rewards on select spending categories, such as groceries and restaurants.\n\nFlexible bonus cash-back cards\n\nSome cards allow you to choose the spending categories to earn your bonus rewards. By selecting categories that align with the types of items you buy frequently, you can maximize your cash-back rewards.\n\nHow to earn cash-back\n\nYou\u2019ll need to make purchases to earn cash-back rewards with a credit card. For example, let\u2019s say you have a card that offers 2% cash back on groceries. If tomorrow\u2019s weekly run to the supermarket winds up costing you $100 and you pay with your card, you\u2019ll earn $2 in cash-back rewards.\n\nCash-back rewards will accumulate as you continue using your cash-back credit card. The running total of how much cash you\u2019ve earned should be easy to find on your monthly statement or via your online account.\n\nMake sure to stay within your credit limit, keep your account in good standing, and look closely at your cash-back credit card\u2019s details to find out how much you can earn on your purchases. Earn rates can vary based on time, such as when an introductory offer provides a higher rate of rewards and what kinds of products you purchase.\n\nHow to redeem cash-back\n\nOnce you have accumulated enough cash-back rewards, you can redeem them for statement credits, bank deposits, gift cards, or other rewards. Make sure to understand the redemption options and requirements of your card. Some may require you to meet a minimum threshold of cash-back rewards before redemption. If you don\u2019t have enough points available, you\u2019ll have to sit on them until you do.\n\nRedemption requirements by issuers\n\nEvery credit card provider has different rules when it comes to redeeming your cash back. Some allow monthly redemption, while others pay out annually. Other providers allow redemption only after you\u2019ve hit a certain threshold. The following are the payout requirements for the major cash-back credit card issuers:\n\nAmerican Express. All cash back earned is paid out annually on your September statement.\n\nBMO. Redeem as little as $1 in cash back as a statement credit. You can also set up automatic direct deposits to your BMO chequing or savings account starting at $25.\n\nCIBC. Cash-back redemptions start at $25. Any unredeemed cash back will appear on your January statement annually.\n\nRBC . Once you earn $25 in cash back, you can have the balance credited to your account at any time by calling in. Alternatively, all accumulated cash back will be credited to your account every January.\n\nScotiabank. All cash back earned appears as a credit on your November statement.\n\nTangerine. Paid monthly to your savings account or applied to your credit card balance.\n\nTD. You can redeem your cash back when you have a minimum amount of $25. Another option is to take your cash back annually every January where there is no minimum amount required.\n\n\u00bb MORE: Read our in-depth TD Cash Back Visa Infinite* Card review\n\nWhen is a good time to redeem my cash-back rewards?\n\nMany cash-back credit cards will allow you to redeem your rewards as soon as they reach a minimum threshold. But you can also save them up over time and cash them in for a more significant, single-shot pay-down of your credit card balance, for example.\n\nChoosing to redeem cash rewards on a regular basis is certainly satisfying. But it could mean dipping below your minimum threshold. The next time you want \u2014 or need \u2014 to use your rewards, you may not have enough at your disposal. Saving your cash back rewards to generate more impact \u2014 to ease the blow of a particularly big purchase \u2014 is a worthy strategy, too. But know that if you fail to keep your account in good standing or decide to close it suddenly, you could lose out on accumulated rewards.\n\nCash-back bonus rewards categories\n\nCash-back bonus rewards categories refer to the specific spending categories or types of purchases that earn higher cash-back rewards on a credit card.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say your credit card gives you 4% cash back on gas. If the card has a flat rate of 1%, this means you\u2019ll earn cash back on gas with a bonus rate of 3%, making it so all your gas purchases would give you 4% cash back. Since many gas stations sell other things, such as snacks and gift cards, you\u2019d also earn 4% cash back on any of those items.\n\nGenerally speaking, Canada\u2019s best cash-back credit cards offer multiple bonus categories. Getting a cash-back card that aligns with your spending patterns can be pretty lucrative. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries, getting a cash-back credit card with an increased earn rate on groceries can significantly benefit you.\n\nYou\u2019ll earn cash back at an increased rate when making purchases in specific spending categories, but you\u2019ll still earn the base earn rate when you make purchases that don\u2019t fall under a bonus category or after you have reached the bonus category cash-back limit. The base earn rate differs for each cash-back credit card but typically ranges between 0.5% and 2%.\n\nCommon rewards categories\n\nCash-back categories can vary depending on the credit card and issuer, but here are some common categories in Canada:\n\nGrocery. Any purchase made at grocery stores, such as Loblaws, No Frills and Metro.\n\nGas. Includes any purchase made at a gas station or service station, like Shell, PetroCanada and Esso.\n\nRestaurants and dining. This usually includes takeout and food delivery services like Uber Eats, DoorDash and SkipTheDishes.\n\nTravel spending. Airline tickets, hotels, car rentals, etc.\n\nTransit and transportation. This may include taking an Uber, a taxi, or paying for public transportation.\n\nStreaming services. Monthly subscriptions to products like Netflix, Disney+, Spotify, etc.\n\nDrug stores and pharmacies. This may include purchases made at a drug store, like Shoppers Drug Mart.\n\nEntertainment. This may include money you spend on tickets to the movies, theater, or a live music concert.\n\nBills and recurring payments. Including wireless phone, internet, and utility bills paid with a credit card.\n\nThe key thing to understand is that each credit card defines its categories differently and employs its own merchant category codes. For example, some cards may group gas and transportation. Some cards lump groceries and restaurants into a \u201cfood and drink\u201d category. To further complicate things, some merchants don\u2019t fall into the categories you would think they would. For example, Costco is not considered a grocery store. As far as credit card processors are concerned, Costco is a wholesale store.\n\nCredit card companies do not typically reveal all of the stores associated with a merchant category publicly. Still, you should be able to contact your credit card provider\u2019s customer service to ask about a specific store. Overall, it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out what category your purchases will fall under, but you may need some trial and error.\n\nHow to choose a cash-back card\n\nBefore applying for a cash-back credit card, select the right one for you and ensure you\u2019re eligible.\n\nCompare cash-back credit card options\n\nWith dozens of cash-back credit cards available, comparing them all can be time-consuming. That said, there are a few things you should look at when considering any cash-back card.\n\nInterest rates . It\u2019s important to look closely at the interest rates associated with any cash-back credit cards you\u2019re considering; many start out in the 19.99% range. Zero interest is charged on balances paid in full every month, but if you don\u2019t, it can significantly add to your debt and erode the benefit of any cash-back rewards you earn.\n\nAnnual fee . Decide if you want to pay an annual fee or not. In most cases, paying a yearly fee means earning more cash back and getting better benefits. On the other hand, no-fee cash-back cards may have a lower earn rate, but if you don\u2019t charge much to your card, you could come out ahead compared to a card with a fee.\n\nWelcome bonus or intro offer . Cash-back credit cards in Canada commonly offer a sign-up bonus for new applicants. The welcome bonus usually comes as a higher cash-back rate for a set period. For example, you might get 10% cash back on all purchases up to $3,000 in spending. If the earn rates are similar with two cards, but one has an excellent welcome bonus, then you might as well take advantage of the promotion. Credit card bonus offers nearly always come with terms and conditions to be met, but be sure you read over the offer thoroughly and understand how much you may need to spend to qualify.\n\nBonus rewards categories . The increased earn rate on bonus categories is arguably the most critical factor when comparing cash-back cards. It\u2019s ideal to choose a card that gives you the most cash-back in the categories where you do the most spending. Remember that the amount you spend in bonus categories every year could earn you more than any welcome bonus offered.\n\nCredit card insurance and additional perks. Many cash-back credit cards offer various forms of insurance and additional benefits that may appeal to you. Some perks to look out for include: Travel insurance. Roadside assistance. Mobile device insurance. Credit card concierge services. Extended warranties. Purchase protection.\n\n\n\nMake sure you qualify\n\nEven though the benefits of a cash-back credit card are relatively simple to understand, you\u2019ll still have to reckon with a few eligibility requirements to consider before applying.\n\nAge and residency status . Most cash-back credit cards require you to be both a Canadian resident and the legal age of majority in the province where you live to apply for your own card. The age of majority is 18 in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and Saskatchewan. It\u2019s 19 everywhere in all other provinces.\n\nCredit score . A good credit score is required in most cases to qualify for a cash-back credit card. In Canada, a credit score that ranges between 660 and 724 is considered good. If you do not have a good credit score, consider a credit card designed for bad or no credit, a prepaid card, or a secured credit card instead of a cash-back credit card.\n\nPersonal or household income requirements. Some cash-back credit cards come with relatively lower income requirements, but if you want a higher-tier cash-back credit card, you\u2019ll likely need a higher income.\n\nHow to maximize your cash-back rewards\n\nThere are plenty of tricks to help you get the most out of your cash-back credit cards. The more tips you adopt, the more cash back you\u2019ll earn. That said, it\u2019s best only to follow the advice that you\u2019re comfortable with.\n\nApply for a new card ahead of major expenses . Since many of Canada\u2019s best cash-back credit cards have a generous welcome bonus, it\u2019s often worth your trouble to apply for a new card before you make a major purchase. For example, let\u2019s say you need to renew your home and auto insurance, which will cost you about $2,000. You could apply for a cash-back credit card offering 10% cash back as the welcome bonus. Then, when you charge your insurance to your card, you\u2019d get $200 back.\n\nKeep your eye out for attractive intro offers and sign-up bonuses . Welcome offers are constantly changing, so watch for any current promotions. Getting 10% cash back for a set period is generous, but if the card also waives the annual fee for the first year, they\u2019re practically paying you to sign up. When you get close to 12 months of card membership, you might cancel the card before your annual fee posts. You could then apply for a new cash-back credit card with a strong bonus.\n\nPay attention to intro offer limits. Keep in mind that many cash-back credit cards have a limit on their sign-up offer. If you have a substantial purchase, you could apply for more than one card and split up your purchase to maximize your cash back. However, if you need to pay an annual fee for the new card, it may negate the cash back you earn, so pay attention to the details.\n\nCarry multiple cards . Many people focus on a single cash-back credit card, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with having multiple credit cards. In fact, having more than one card is the easiest way to maximize your cash back. Start with a primary card that gives you an increased earn rate where you spend most of your spending. You could then complement that card with a no-fee card that gives you bonus categories where your primary card doesn\u2019t. Just use the credit card that gives you the most cash back whenever you shop.\n\nBuy gift cards in bonus categories . Groceries and gas are two of the most popular merchant categories where you\u2019ll earn additional cash back. Here\u2019s the thing: grocery stores and gas stations sell gift cards that can be used at many retailers. That essentially allows you to earn extra cash back.\n\nAdd supplementary users . Most credit cards allow you to add supplementary users. The advantage is that all authorized cardholders earn cash back on their purchases, including any bonus. Best of all, the cash back gets combined into a single pool, so you\u2019ll be racking up that cash back in no time.\n\nUse cash-back websites. Various online sites allow you to earn additional cash whenever you shop online. First, you need to create an account. Afterwards, you would select the partner retailers through their online portal. When you do your shopping, eligible purchases will earn you cash back. You\u2019ll earn cash back twice if you pay with your cash-back credit card.\n\nShould I choose cash-back or rewards points?\n\nAnswering this question depends on what you\u2019re looking to get out of your credit card.\n\nCash-back rewards may be the route to take if you\u2019re hoping for a little help paying your credit card bills, or want to earn rewards that are typically easy to calculate, collect and apply toward your balance.\n\nRewards points, however, can generally be redeemed in a wider variety of ways, including discounts on travel or merchandise. That flexibility can be very attractive to some consumers. However, the value of the points you collect can fluctuate, making tracking your points a more complicated endeavour than cash-back rewards.\n\nAre cash-back credit cards worth it?\n\nThere are two situations where a cash-back card might not be the right choice:\n\nIf you\u2019ll pay more in annual fees than you\u2019d earn in cash-back. If you can get a better return with a points-based rewards card. For example, let\u2019s say you got a travel rewards credit card and did the same spending. Would the points you earn be worth more than the cash back you could potentially earn? If so, it makes more sense to get a travel credit card.",

The consistency of our strategy over the years has allowed us to execute today with an eye on long-term growth. A core element of our strategy is the deliberate diversification of our business.\n\nThe investments we have made over the years have strengthened the value that we can deliver to our customers and the broader economy. That starts with a broad geographic footprint. The diversification extends well beyond locations. It\u2019s also reflected in the products and services that we offer.\n\nMany people still think of Mastercard as a credit card company. While that was our origins almost 60 years ago, today we offer consumers and business a wide range of ways to pay. Commercial payments represented approximately 13% of total GDV in 2024, and there\u2019s much more opportunity to unlock. And on the other side of that virtuous cycle are our value-added services and solutions, which now represent nearly 40% of total net revenues.\n\nYesterday, we reported on our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. In our conference call, we discussed our strong quarter and the momentum that we carry into 2025. A few highlights \u2014 from the quarter and our ongoing roadmap \u2014 include:\n\nGrowing our core\n\nPeople rely on Mastercard, turning to our cards and the other payment choices we power for everyday purchases and to help power their businesses. Every day our teams are working to give people a reason to choose Mastercard. That\u2019s why we\u2019re improving the experience every step of the way. It includes what so many take for granted \u2014 the simplicity and security of a tap at a terminal. We\u2019re building on that with tokens, passkeys and biometrics to make it easier to verify who you are and authenticate every purchase, making payments faster, more secure and simpler. In 2024, we tokenized about 4 billion transactions per month, a huge step forward from where we started just over a decade ago.\n\nMaking the commercial personal\n\nCommercial payments are inherently complex given the sheer volume of business being conducted across geographies and a wide range of players. But the needs of these organizations are simple and straightforward \u2014 they want certainty on when payments and deliveries will arrive. They need to know that when money is sent, it\u2019s getting to who needs it, when they need it. It\u2019s these demands that are driving us to think differently about solutions like virtual cards, which enable invoice payments between businesses in a safe and simple manner with valuable data flows.\n\nBuilding for the future\n\nOur value-added services and solutions start with and go beyond the transaction. From data analytics and fraud protection to loyalty and digital identity, these innovations are integral to our journey. They allow us to provide more personalized, data-driven solutions to customers, while continuing to strengthen how we help them secure their environment with AI-powered tools such as Recorded Future.\n\nWe are well-positioned for the opportunities ahead, driven by our diversified business model, the significant opportunity for further secular shift to digital forms of payment in both consumer and commercial flows, and strong demand for our differentiated value-added services and solutions.\n\nThanks to our teams around the world \u2014 the momentum we\u2019ve built so far is just the beginning. We\u2019re ready for the journey ahead.",

            "content": "Visa and Mastercard, processing billions of payment transactions yearly, reported strong financial growth in 2025, driven by rising payment volumes and cross-border transactions. However, their massive operations generate significant carbon emissions, pushing them to adopt sustainability and net zero strategies.\n\nHow do they balance profit and sustainability? This article uncovers Visa and Mastercard\u2019s financial strength and net zero initiatives \u2013 who\u2019s making the biggest impact on emissions reduction and climate action.\n\nStrong Numbers, Stronger Strategy: Visa\u2019s Q1 2025 Performance\n\nVisa reported strong Q1 2025 results, with net revenue rising 10% year-over-year (YoY) to $9.5 billion. Net income also increased 5% to $5.1 billion, while GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew 8% to $2.58 and non-GAAP EPS stood at $2.75. Visa\u2019s board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.59 per share.\n\nThe company attributed its growth to strong consumer spending, a rise in payment volume, and an increase in cross-border transactions. CEO Ryan McInerney highlighted three major growth drivers:\n\nConsumer payments,\n\nNew payment flows, and\n\nValue-added services.\n\nThese areas continue to expand as Visa strengthens its global network.\n\nA key move during the quarter was Visa\u2019s acquisition of Featurespace, an artificial intelligence-powered fraud protection firm. This acquisition aligns with Visa\u2019s long-term goal of enhancing transaction security.\n\nWhile Visa continues to grow, its expenses are also increasing, particularly in research and development. However, its strong revenue growth has helped maintain profitability and reinforce its position as a leader in the payments industry.\n\nMastering Growth: How Mastercard Outpaced Expectations\n\nMastercard posted strong 2024 results, with net revenue increasing 12% YoY to $28.2 billion, beating market expectations. Adjusted EPS grew 19% to $14.60, exceeding analyst estimates. Its adjusted operating margin improved slightly to 58.4%.\n\nIn Q4 2024, Mastercard\u2019s gross dollar volume reached $2.6 trillion, up 12% YoY. Cross-border volumes, a key revenue driver, rose 20%, while switched transactions increased 11% to 42.2 billion. The company\u2019s value-added services generated $3.1 billion in revenue, up 16%.\n\nMastercard\u2019s value-added services and solutions business also played a critical role in its financial performance. Net revenue from these services reached $3.1 billion, a 16% YoY increase, driven by demand for security, digital authentication, and market insights.\n\nUnlike Visa, Mastercard experienced a sharper increase in operating expenses, which climbed by 14% YoY to $3.3 billion. The rise was mainly due to higher general and administrative costs. However, adjusted operating income still grew by 15% YoY to $4.22 billion.\n\nBoth Visa and Mastercard reported strong financial growth, but Mastercard outpaced Visa in revenue, EPS growth, and transaction volume. Visa focused on operational efficiency and security investments, while Mastercard\u2019s cross-border transactions and value-added services drove its growth.\n\nA Green Rivalry: Who\u2019s Leading the Sustainability and Net Zero Race?\n\nDespite rising expenses, both companies remain leaders in the global payments industry. However, their massive operations with billions of transactions processed annually generate carbon emissions, prompting them to reduce their environmental footprint. While they share common goals, their sustainability and net zero approaches differ.\n\nSwiping Towards Sustainability: Visa\u2019s Carbon Goals and Green Investments\n\nVisa aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2040, aligning with the Paris Agreement\u2019s 1.5\u00b0C pathway. It has been carbon neutral in its operations since 2020, achieving this by reducing direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and purchasing carbon offsets. The company sources 100% renewable electricity for its offices and data centers, significantly cutting GHG emissions.\n\nVisa has made notable strides in reducing its operational emissions, particularly in Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which saw a downward trend from 2009 to 2022. However, in 2023, Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased from 6,400 to 10,600 metric tons of CO2 equivalent, primarily due to a slight uptick in Scope 2 emissions, rising from zero in 2022 to 300 metric tons.\n\nDespite this, Visa continues to offset its emissions significantly toward net zero. The payment processor has invested in carbon offsets equivalent to 66,300 metric tons of CO2 in 2023.\n\nIn terms of Scope 3 emissions, Visa experienced a slight rise in 2023, reaching 409,500 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. This is driven mainly by increases in employee commuting and business travel, while emissions from purchased goods and services saw a small decrease.\n\nCarbon Offsets, Green Finance, and Climate Tech Solutions\n\nVisa invests in renewable energy projects and high-quality carbon offset programs. The company supports global reforestation initiatives and clean energy transition projects.\n\nIn 2023, Visa\u2019s environmental investments helped mitigate the equivalent of 400,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.\n\nThe payment processor\u2019s sustainability efforts extend to financial products. Visa has partnered with fintech firms to introduce carbon footprint tracking tools for consumers.\n\nThrough the Visa Eco Benefits program, banks can offer sustainability-focused rewards and carbon offset options. Additionally, Visa has worked with financial institutions to issue over 20 million eco-friendly payment cards made from recycled materials or biodegradable alternatives.\n\nFurthermore, Visa is integrating sustainability into mobility and payment solutions. The company supports contactless payments for public transit to reduce reliance on cash and has collaborated with EV charging networks to streamline payments.\n\nThe company is also investing in climate-focused fintech startups that develop solutions for carbon tracking and sustainable finance. However, compared to its competitor, its indirect emissions strategy is less aggressive.\n\nPriceless Progress: Mastercard\u2019s Commitment to a Net-Zero Future\n\nMastercard has been carbon neutral in its operations since 2021 and aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. Like Visa, it sources 100% renewable electricity for its offices and data centers.\n\nMastercard has made significant progress in reducing its GHG emissions as part of its commitment to environmental sustainability. In 2023, the company achieved a 1% reduction in total emissions, totaling 557,545 metric tons of CO2 equivalent across Scope 1, 2, and 3.\n\nNotably, its Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which account for 9% of total GHG emissions, decreased by 7%, producing 52,054 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. These emissions have declined significantly, 48%, from its 2016 baseline.\n\nFor Scope 3 emissions, which make up 78% of the company\u2019s total emissions, Mastercard saw a 3% reduction in its supply chain emissions in 2023, totaling 437,588 metric tons of CO2 equivalent.\n\nThe payment processor remains on track to meet its 2025 targets of reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 38% and Scope 3 emissions by 20% compared to 2016 levels.\n\nMastercard\u2018s Scope 3 emissions came from indirect sources, primarily from its financial partners and supply chain. To address this, the company has integrated sustainability criteria into its vendor selection process and encourages its banking partners to reduce their own carbon footprints.\n\nMastercard\u2019s Green Finance and Reforestation Efforts\n\nMastercard takes a different approach to carbon offsets and net zero from Visa. The company launched the Priceless Planet Coalition, a global reforestation initiative aiming to restore 100 million trees by 2025.\n\nThrough this initiative, Mastercard has already funded the planting of 60 million trees across 20 countries, aiming to remove approximately 10 million metric tons of CO2 from the atmosphere by 2030.\n\nMastercard has also taken the lead in sustainable financial tools. The Mastercard Carbon Calculator, developed with Doconomy, allows consumers to track the carbon footprint of their purchases directly within their banking apps. Over 50 banks worldwide have integrated this tool, helping millions of users make informed spending decisions.\n\nAdditionally, Mastercard has expanded its ESG-linked financial products, including green bonds and sustainability-focused credit cards. In 2023, the company supported the issuance of $500 million in ESG-linked financial products, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable finance.\n\nMastercard is also investing in climate technology and EV infrastructure. It has partnered with global EV charging networks to streamline payment processes and promote wider EV adoption. The company is also funding fintech startups that focus on climate risk management and sustainable investment platforms.\n\nVisa vs. Mastercard: Who Leads in Sustainability?\n\nBoth Visa and Mastercard are making significant strides in financials and net zero. They both have achieved carbon neutrality in their operations, but Mastercard appears to have a more comprehensive and aggressive approach.\n\nBy integrating sustainability into financial products, investing in large-scale reforestation, and actively reducing indirect emissions, Mastercard sets a higher standard in climate action. Visa, on the other hand, excels in operational efficiency and renewable energy adoption but may need to expand its influence over its financial network to achieve a more substantial impact.",

            "content": "Q : Can you discuss the drivers of cross-border growth and expectations for 2025? A : Sachin Mehra, CFO, explained that cross-border volume growth remains strong, driven by consumer and commercial spending. The first four weeks of January showed a slight decrease from 20% to 18% due to intra-Europe factors like travel spend pull-forward and calendarization. The overall health of cross-border spending is excellent, and they expect continued strength in 2025.\n\nThe company anticipates a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points from foreign exchange in 2025, which could affect revenue growth.\n\nMastercard Inc ( NYSE:MA ) is experiencing competitive pressures, particularly in the European market, where local payment solutions are being developed.\n\nThe company faces potential challenges from geopolitical concerns and shifts in monetary and fiscal policy, which could impact future performance.\n\nThe acquisition of Recorded Future and Minna Technologies will impact operating expenses growth by approximately 5 percentage points in 2025.\n\nThe company is leveraging its tokenization and biometric capabilities to enhance security and improve the consumer experience, with 4 billion transactions tokenized per month in 2024.\n\nMastercard Inc ( NYSE:MA ) is capitalizing on the secular shift to digital payments, with a focus on consumer payments, commercial flows, and services and solutions.\n\nThe company has successfully expanded its partnerships, including significant renewals and expansions with major banks and financial institutions globally.\n\nMastercard Inc ( NYSE:MA ) reported a strong fourth quarter with net revenues up 16% and adjusted net income up 19% year-over-year on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: What are your expectations for Value-Added Services in 2025 compared to consumer payments?

            "content": "According to a report from crypto exchange CEX.IO, stablecoin transfers reached $27.6 trillion in 2024, outpacing Visa and Mastercard\u2019s combined transaction volume by 7.68%.\n\nThe report pointed out that stablecoins consistently outperformed traditional payment providers throughout the year despite a dip in Q3 due to broader market slowdowns.\n\nThis trend signals a shift in global remittances as legacy providers like Western Union and MoneyGram struggle to adapt to a rising demand for digital assets.\n\nThe stablecoin supply expanded by 59% during this period, exceeding $200 billion. This growth pushed stablecoins to represent 1% of the total US dollar supply, a significant increase from 0.63% at the start of the year.\n\nUSDC leads as Solana gains dominance\n\nCircle\u2019s USDC emerged as the dominant stablecoin for on-chain transactions, accounting for 70% of total transfer volume. However, its influence weakened slightly in Q3 due to a temporary decline in DeFi activity.\n\nTether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by market cap, experienced substantial growth, with its total transfer volume more than doubling. Despite this, its market share declined from 43% to 25% last year.\n\nSolana became the most active blockchain for stablecoin transfers, overtaking Tron and Ethereum in January 2024. The surge in Solana-based activity propelled USDC\u2019s market share, with 73% of the network\u2019s stablecoin supply tied to USDC transactions.\n\nAccording to CEX.IO:\n\n\u201cThis increase aligned with Solana\u2019s overall ecosystem growth, as stablecoins on the network were predominantly used for DeFi and other dApp activities.\u201d\n\nBots fuel stablecoin volume\n\nCEX.IO pointed out that Bot-driven trading played a significant role in stablecoin transactions last year, with automated systems responsible for 70% of total volume.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s research, bot-driven trades were particularly dominant on Ethereum, Base, and Solana.\n\nThe crypto exchange reported that unadjusted transaction volumes\u2014primarily reflecting bot activity\u2014represented 77% of all stablecoin transfers in 2024. This marked a fourfold increase from 2023, with Base even overtaking Ethereum in Q4 stablecoin volume due to the rise of automated trading.\n\nIt continued that unadjusted transactions comprised over 98% of total stablecoin activity in networks where USDC dominates, such as Solana and Base.\n\nThis surge was fueled by these networks\u2019 high transaction speeds, low costs, booming DeFi ecosystem, and rapid proliferation of meme tokens. In December alone, memecoins accounted for 56% of Solana\u2019s decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume.\n\nDespite concerns over bots manipulating markets through frontrunning and sandwich attacks, CEX.IO noted that they also improve efficiency. These automated systems facilitate arbitrage, execute recurring smart contract transactions, and help cover users\u2019 gas fees.\n\nCEX.IO added:\n\n\u201cAs a result, bot dominance in stablecoin transactions could also represent the maturation of certain networks.\u201d\n\nWhat next for stablecoins?\n\nThe exchange said stablecoins cemented their role as essential liquidity sources in DeFi, trading, and cross-border payments in 2024. This trend is expected to persist in 2025, particularly in post-halving cycles, which historically trigger increased trading volume and capital flows.\n\nSupply expansion is also likely to continue. The company noted that previous market cycles showed stablecoin growth extends beyond bullish phases, often persisting even in early downturns. For instance, in 2022, stablecoin supply kept rising until March\u2014five months after the market\u2019s peak. This suggests that demand could remain steady even if broader market conditions weaken.\n\nAnother key development could involve a shift beyond USDT-dominated networks like Tron. The report noted that USDT faces growing competition and increased regulatory scrutiny, which could erode its market share and impact Tron\u2019s dominance in stablecoin transactions.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Pectra update, expected in March 2025, could strengthen the network\u2019s appeal as a stablecoin hub. The upgrade aims to improve scalability, reduce gas fees, and enhance user experience across Ethereum Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks.\n\nMentioned in this article",

            "content": "Mastercard\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings results showed that consumers still rely on their cards for everyday spending \u2014 and beyond the resilient consumer, tens of trillions of dollars in commercial payments beckon.\n\nA presentation released Thursday (Jan. 30) in tandem with the earnings report indicated that worldwide gross dollar volumes were up 12% year on year to $2.6 trillion.\n\nDrilling down into specific markets, the United States GDV was up 9% to $793 billion. Within that figure, spending on debit cards surged by 10.7%, outpacing, at least for the quarter, the 7.8% gain in credit card spending.\n\nThe number of cards wielded by consumers and commercial clients across the globe was up 6% to 3.5 billion.\n\nInvestors cheered the results and sent the shares up by more than 4% in early trading Thursday.\n\nCross-border payments volume was up 20%, and the business update through the first few weeks of the year through Tuesday (Jan. 28) indicated that the year-over-year growth rate was 18%.\n\nDuring a conference call with analysts, CEO Michael Miebach said that \u201cthe macroeconomic environment continues to perform well, and it is underpinned by healthy consumer spending as we\u2019ve seen in today\u2019s news. The labor market is strong with low unemployment and continued wage growth. Inflation has moderated, but to varying degrees across categories and countries, consumers remain engaged. Affluent consumers have benefited from the wealth effect, while the mass segment remains supported by the labor market.\u201d\n\nTokenization Momentum\n\nMiebach said that during 2024, the company tokenized 4 billion transactions per month, a rate that is 40 times higher than it was six years ago.\n\n\u201cThere are many use cases for tokens,\u201d he said during the call. \u201cTake, for example, the next click of our multi-option payment solutions. We\u2019re rolling out the Mastercard One credential, which allows consumers the flexibility and control to set their payment preferences in the banking app for each transaction if they so choose to beat credit, debit, prepaid or buy now, pay later \u2014 it\u2019s all behind one credential, one token.\u201d\n\nCommercial Payments Opportunity\n\nCommercial flows represent an $80 trillion opportunity for Mastercard, given that only about $3 trillion of that spend takes place on cards, Miebach said on the call. In 2024, commercial debit and credit volumes were 13% of total GDV, and they were 11% higher as measured year over year.\n\nDisbursements and remittances offer an additional $20 trillion in terms of addressable market potential, and Mastercard Move transactions leaped 40% year over year in the fourth quarter, he said.\n\nChief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra said during the call that contactless payments now represent 72% of all in-person, switched transactions. Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 17%, tied to demand for data-driven market insights, security products and services, and digital and authentication solutions.\n\nMehra said that looking ahead, Mastercard expects \u201cvalue-added services solutions to grow in 2025, and the underlying fundamentals of what we\u2019re doing there continue to be very healthy.\u201d\n\nAsked on the call about stablecoins, management said the potential exists with B2B cross-border payments and with partnerships with the likes of J.P. Morgan and other settlement banks.\n\nLater during the call \u2014 and in a nod to Mastercard 2030, one-click payments and the drive to get rid of manual entry of card-level data \u2014 Mastercard executives said Europe remains a key market, with the emergence of the Payment Services Directive and a heightened focus on security.\n\nMiebach also weighed in on the new administration and Congress.\n\n\u201cWe have an administration coming in that is touting a business-friendly approach, and that\u2019s fundamentally good for us,\u201d he said during the call. \u201cThe conversation around tariffs and to the intended use of tariffs that\u2019s been discussed, we have to see how it plays out and what will happen\u2026 Questions like digital trade are going to be important questions.\u201d",

            "content": "Lionel Ng/Bloomberg\n\nUPDATE: This article includes executive and analyst commentary.\n\nAs Capital One's agreement to buy Discover Financial Services nears possible approval, Mastercard contends the introduction of a major new competitor should not dramatically impact its business.\n\nMastercard has several payment partnerships with Capital One, including processing Capital One debit cards, a business that may migrate to Discover's debit network.\n\n\"There's great momentum in debit that we have created in the U.S., [Capital One] isn't the only debit partner that we have,\" said Michael Miebach, CEO of Mastercard during Thursday's earnings call, noting Capital One has signaled it will move its debit card processing to Discover's rival network.\n\nCapital One plans to acquire Discover for $35 billion, a purchase that is awaiting regulatory approval in a Trump-influenced political environment that's expected to be more friendly to M&A than the Biden administration.\n\nA combination of Discover and Capital One would create one of the largest card networks in the U.S., creating more competition for Visa and Mastercard. That should not impact other parts of Mastercard's work with Capital One, and Mastercard noted its outlook for 2025 takes the combination of Capital One and Discover into account.\n\n\"There is a whole range of examples where we have partners that we compete with in some parts of our business,\" Miebach said. \"Capital One is a tremendous partner for us. We value this partnership and will continue to align with them.\"\n\n\n\nTariff troubles?\n\nAnalysts asked Miebach about the impact of Donald Trump's threat to impose wide-ranging tariffs.\n\n\"It's a question that is top of mind in many industries,\" Miebach said. \"There is some political uncertainty.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has signaled that it will be mostly \"pro business,\" Miebach said, adding any impact of tariffs would be indirect.\n\n\"We're not in the import-export business,\" he said.\n\nIn recent remarks, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Trump's tariffs could pressure prices. But the results would likely be a one-time price hike rather than sustained inflation. Waller also said it's still uncertain what countries could be hit with tariffs and the size, scope and duration \u2014 adding he does not expect the policies to be \"draconian.\"\n\n\n\nMastercard's earnings\n\nMastercard's focus on product expansion is showing results in the card network's earnings growth.\n\nFor the quarter ended Dec. 31, Mastercard reported net income of $3.34 billion, up about 20% from the prior year. Adjusted for nonrecurring costs, earnings were $3.82 per share, also up about 20%, and revenue was $7.49 billion, up 14%.\n\nThose results were better than Wall Street analyst expectations of $7.38 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $3.68, according to a Zacks Investment Research survey.\n\nCross-border volume growth topped estimates for the three-month period, growing 20% on a local-currency basis, compared with a 17.5% estimate. Global purchase volume was $2.11 trillion, in line with Wall Street estimates.\n\nFor the full year, the card network reported profits of $12.87 billion, EPS of $13.89 and revenue of $28.17 billion. Zacks had estimated revenue of $28.06 billion. For 2025, Mastercard projected revenue growth at the high end of low double digits, not consumer spending trends, macroeconomic environment and early year trends.\n\n\"Our diverse capabilities in payments and services and solutions \u2014 including the acquisition of Recorded Future this quarter \u2014 set us apart and position us well for long-term growth as we outlined at our Investor Day,\" Miebach said in prepared remarks. Recorded Future is a cybersecurity firm.\n\nMastercard's stock was up about 4% on Thursday morning.\n\nMastercard is in the midst of diversifying its revenue streams beyond payment processing as competition, legal and regulatory battles pressure revenue from card fees.\n\nThe card brand is investing in new products to expand its addressable market. In the fourth quarter, that strategy included the $2.7 billion acquisition of Recorded Future, and the purchase of Minna Technologies, a subscription insights company.\n\nFinding ways to leverage distributed ledger technology, the type of platform that supports many cryptocurrencies, has been a major part of the strategy. Mastercard in late 2024 connected its multitoken network to JPMorgan's Kinexys Digital Payments , a payment rail that powers real-time transfers through Kinexys, the bank's blockchain business unit. It's similar to the decentralized processing model that supports bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies but can also be used to streamline transactions with parties using different currencies.\n\n\"This partnership brings greater transparency and settlement capabilities,\" Miebach said during Thursday's earnings call.\n\nIn another major bank partnership, the company inked a global payments partnership with Citigroup that allows the mega-bank to connect with its Mastercard Move product to move money domestically and across borders to bank accounts, prepaid debit cards, mobile wallets and cash-access locations in a few seconds.\n\n\"We continue to view value-added services as a linchpin of durable above-average organic revenue growth and competitive advantage,\" research firm William Blair said in an analyst note, noting revenues from value-added services rose 17% in 2024 versus 15% in 2023, placing VAS on pace to compose 50% of Mastercard's total revenue by 2030.\n\nMastercard in recent months also settled a collective card fee lawsuit in London . The settlement was about 200 million pounds ($254.2 million). The lawsuit was brought by Walter Merricks on behalf of 46 million U.K. adults. Originally, claimants had said damages were as much as 10 billion pounds. The settlement marked the end of nine years of litigation between Merricks and Mastercard, Merricks said in a statement.\n\nMastercard and Visa have been battling a slew of lawsuits over the amount they charge for card fees. The payment-processing giants in March agreed to settle a 20-year U.S. suit over interchange fees, only to later have the settlement struck down in June by a federal judge. Mastercard in 2024 additionally laid off about 3% of its staff by September as part of a restructuring. Other 2024 moves included adding partners in its push for open banking . The card brand additionally partnered with the Medical Tourism Association to provide virtual card technology for arranging treatment, booking travel and making payments.\n\n\"This was a solid quarter for Mastercard,\" said research firm Edward Jones in an analyst note. \"Further, spending trends through the first three weeks of January showed consistent growth in line with results this quarter. These steady results should be well received by investors, as it demonstrates the continued strength of consumer spending. It further supports the view that the overall economy will achieve a soft landing and that a substantial slowdown will largely be avoided.\"",

The company surpassed market expectations with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.82, higher than the forecasted $3.69. Net revenue climbed to $7.5 billion, beating the estimated $7.385 billion.

Besides its core functionalities, Mastercard provides value-added services like cybersecurity and analytics, strengthening its market position. Its extensive network functions as the backbone of global payment solutions, facilitating growth and innovation across diverse regions.\n\nRecently, Mastercard has focused on strategic investments and expansion, enhancing its multi-rail payment systems and cybersecurity offerings. Acquisitions such as Recorded Future have bolstered its cybersecurity capabilities, underlining the importance of these services in promoting safe, seamless, and efficient transactions. Brand strength and worldwide acceptance remain crucial to its enduring market leadership.\n\nQuarter in Review\n\nMastercard's Q4 2024 saw a notable increase in adjusted EPS to $3.82, surpassing analyst estimates. Net revenue rose to $7.5 billion, marking a year-over-year increase of 14%. This growth was primarily fueled by the expansion of its payments network and a rise in value-added services. Gross dollar volume increased 12%, driven by a 20% rise in cross-border volume, highlighting Mastercard\u2019s capability in handling global transactions.\n\nOperating income surged by 17% to $3.9 billion, with operating margins rising slightly from 51.5% in the previous year to 52.6%. The company's focus on value-added solutions paid off, as cyber and intelligence services gained traction, enhancing revenue and customer loyalty. These advancements underscore Mastercard's effective execution of strategic initiatives to sustain competitive advantages.\n\nRegulatory compliance continues to challenge Mastercard, as evolving requirements could impact operations. However, its strategic direction, marked by investments in open banking and digital identity solutions, positions it well for future opportunities. Share repurchases and dividends further reflect its commitment to returning value to shareholders, with $11 billion spent on repurchasing shares in 2024.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nLooking ahead, Mastercard aims to sustain its growth with strategic investments and an expanded focus on avenues that enhance revenue streams and customer engagement.\n\nMastercard plans to build on its current momentum by advancing its multi-rail systems and strengthening partnerships within the industry. Keeping an eye on regulatory changes and competitive pressures will be essential for maintaining its market position. Investors should pay attention to Mastercard's strategic moves in the upcoming quarters, as the company seeks to capitalize on digital trends and expand its global footprint.",

This compares to earnings of $3.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.80%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this processor of debit and credit card payments would post earnings of $3.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.89, delivering a surprise of 4.29%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nMasterCard , which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, posted revenues of $7.49 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.44%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.55 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nMasterCard shares have added about 4.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for MasterCard?\n\nWhile MasterCard has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for MasterCard: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

CEO Mark Ross-Smith said the economics can be difficult with typical operating margins from selling a seat domestically around 12%, and less in coach.\n\n\u201cFor that margin the airline has to accept payments, check you in, provide airport facilities, employ thousands of staff, have gate agents, tag your checked bags and deliver them to you after you land, employ customer support agents, feed you on the plane, comply with a growing list of mandatory safety regulations in all markets they fly to versus running a loyalty program, which sells points and miles to banks, enjoys a 30%-80% operating margin, employs much less staff, and has no airplanes to maintain, no pilots, and no unions,\u201d Ross-Smith said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insanely attractive to move toward rewarding people who spend more and contribute toward the part of the company (the loyalty program) that ultimately underpins the value of the airline group,\u201d he said. \u201cWho needs frequent flyers when you have frequent spenders?\u201d\n\nChris Lewis, head of research at FinanceBuzz, had a different perspective.\n\n\u201cAirlines obviously have to be profitable, but I think they\u2019re quickly realizing that the way to do that isn\u2019t by skimping on the customer experience,\u201d he told PYMNTS.",

Thanks to a variety of co-branded rewards, Mastercards have become an indispensable tool for many Canadians.\n\nThe best Mastercard credit cards balance value and function, offering comprehensive insurance coverage, competitive rewards rates and practical perks.\n\nMethodology BACK TO TOP NerdWallet Canada selects the best credit cards based on overall consumer value as well as their suitability for specific kinds of consumers. Factors in our evaluation methodology include each card\u2019s earning rates, rewards structure (such as flat-rate or bonus categories), annual fee, redemption options, promotional APR period for purchases, bonus offers for new cardholders, and noteworthy features such as insurance, loyalty bonuses or the ability to choose one\u2019s own rewards categories.\n\nGuide to Mastercard credit cards\n\nMastercard is one of the major card networks in Canada. With its comprehensive selection of credit cards and various rewards options, it has much to offer.\n\nWhat is a Mastercard credit card?\n\nA Mastercard credit card is a card that can be used to make in-person or online transactions with available credit. Borrowed money must be repaid by the end of each billing cycle, or the outstanding balance begins accruing interest.\n\nTransactions made with a Mastercard credit card take place on the Mastercard payment network. The task of creating and issuing cards to everyday consumers is done by financial institutions. Credit limits, annual fees, rewards programs and insurance coverage vary by card and issuer.\n\nMastercard credit card tiers\n\nMastercard offers three tiers of card membership: Standard, World and World Elite. Generally, the higher the tier, the better the card\u2019s perks, but top-shelf cards tend to have stricter eligibility criteria and steeper annual fees.\n\nStandard\n\nThe Standard tier is Mastercard\u2019s baseline card category. These entry-level cards are a practical fit for first-time cardholders, newcomers or those seeking a no-frills card.\n\nStandard Mastercards typically have low or no annual fees and less stringent eligibility requirements. But these cards may lack the enticing features and perks of higher-tier Mastercards.\n\nWorld\n\nWorld Mastercards occupy a practical middle ground between the Standard and World Elite categories. Credit cards in this tier tend to be tougher to qualify for than Standard Mastercards and are more likely to impose annual fees. But these drawbacks are balanced with richer rewards and better insurance coverage.\n\nWorld Elite\n\nCrowning Mastercard\u2019s membership tiers is its World Elite category. These credit cards carry higher fees and stricter eligibility criteria. In return, they typically offer an enticing collection of perks and rewards, like comprehensive insurance coverage, airport lounge access, free global Wi-Fi, car rental discounts and more.\n\nMastercard perks and benefits\n\nSome common features and programs are available to all Mastercard credit cardholders. Taking advantage of these benefits can help you get the most out of whichever Mastercard you choose.\n\nMastercard ID Theft Protection\n\nThe Mastercard ID Theft Protection program protects personal information and identifies fraudulent activity. The service is free, but cardholders must opt in and enroll in the program. Cardholders are alerted to suspicious activity, and Mastercard support is available 24 hours a day to resolve any issues.\n\nMastercard Zero Liability Protection\n\nAll Mastercard credit cardholders are covered by Mastercard\u2019s Zero Liability Protection, which means they won\u2019t be on the line for any unauthorized transactions should their card fall into the wrong hands. To remain covered by this policy, Mastercard states that its cardholders must take reasonable care in protecting their credit cards from loss or theft and, if lost or stolen, report the event to their financial institution immediately.\n\nMastercard Global Service\n\nThe Mastercard Global Service is a 24-hour support program available to Mastercard credit cardholders. Cardholders can call and speak with a Mastercard representative to report lost or stolen cards, locate ATMs, access their account information and more. Local toll-free numbers are available in over 80 countries.\n\nMastercard Travel and Lifestyle Services\n\nWhen you book travel experiences through the Mastercard Travel and Lifestyle Services program, you can take advantage of the following perks:\n\nComplimentary professional travel services. Get in touch with a Mastercard Lifestyle Manager by phone, email or live chat 24 hours a day to discuss your travel needs.\n\nMastercard Hotel Stay Guarantee. Book a three-, four- or five-star hotel stay through the Mastercard Travel and Lifestyle Services program and receive the support of Mastercard\u2019s Lifestyle Managers should anything go wrong.\n\nLowest Hotel Rate Guarantee. Find the same hotel stay for less after booking a room through the Mastercard Travel and Lifestyle Service, and Mastercard pledges to refund the difference.\n\nMastercard luxury hotel and resorts portfolio. Enjoy upgrades at eligible properties, like complimentary daily breakfast and amenity credits.\n\nFree nights and car upgrades. Receive car rental upgrades and free night stays with Mastercard\u2019s partner hotels.\n\nMastercard Airport Concierge. Have a dedicated agent escort you and your travel companions through the airport at over 700 locations worldwide.\n\nHow to choose the Mastercard credit card that\u2019s right for you\n\nThough all Mastercards share the features listed above, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re all an equally good fit for your wallet. When comparing your card options, be sure to consider the following:\n\nAnnual fee. There are plenty of Mastercards on the market with no annual fee, but you may find more valuable perks offered by cards with higher fees.\n\nInterest rates. Credit card interest rates vary. If you tend to carry a balance, you may want to consider a low-rate credit card.\n\nCredit score requirements. Canadian credit card providers typically don\u2019t advertise credit score criteria, but the higher your score, the more likely you are to qualify for a credit card. You can check your credit report and work on getting a better score to be eligible for higher-tier credit cards.\n\nAnnual income criteria. You may be required to meet annual income thresholds to qualify for some Mastercards.\n\nRewards. Mastercard credit cards earn many types of rewards, including cash back, Air Miles, Canadian Tire Money, PC Optimum points and more.\n\nInsurance. Coverage offerings range from baseline extended warranty and purchase protection to robust travel insurance and rental car coverage.\n\nMastercard credit card issuers\n\nThe following card issuers offer Mastercard credit cards:\n\nATB Financial.\n\nBank of China (Canada).\n\nBMO Bank of Montreal.\n\nBrim Financial.\n\nCanadian Tire Bank.\n\nCapital One.\n\nCIBC.\n\nCollabria Financial Services Inc.\n\nDesjardins.\n\nMBNA.\n\nNational Bank of Canada.\n\nPresident\u2019s Choice Financial.\n\nRBC Royal Bank.\n\nRogers Bank.\n\nScotiabank.\n\nServus Credit Union.\n\nTangerine.\n\nWalmart Canada Bank.\n\nHow to apply for a Mastercard credit card\n\nOnce you\u2019ve determined the right Mastercard for you, you\u2019ll need to submit an application. Whether you do this in person at a branch or online, the steps you\u2019ll need to take will be similar:\n\nReview the card\u2019s terms and conditions. Ensure you meet any eligibility criteria. Specific requirements will differ by card and issuer. However, to qualify for a Mastercard credit card, you typically must: Be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.\n\nBe at least the age of majority in your province or territory.\n\nMeet credit score requirements.\n\nMeet annual income requirements. Fill in your personal information. You can expect to provide your full name, residential address, employment information and other financial information. Submit the application.\n\nExpect to be notified by mail or email once your application has been processed. If approved, your card will be sent by mail. You\u2019ll need to activate your new credit card before you can use it.\n\nHow to activate a Mastercard credit card\n\nYou can usually activate a new Mastercard by phone or through your card provider\u2019s website or mobile app. You\u2019ll need to enter some personal information, including your new credit card number, its expiration date, security code and, in some cases, an activation code.\n\nMastercard credit card alternatives\n\nMastercards are a popular credit card option accepted in more than 210 countries around the world. But but there are alternatives worth considering.\n\nVisa credit cards\n\nVisa credit cards are accepted in over 200 countries and offer access to more than 2.5 million ATMs around the globe.

Mastercard will provide AMP Bank customers with seamless and secure payment technology, including Australia\u2019s first numberless-facing debit card for small businesses.\n\nThrough Mastercard, AMP Bank\u2019s debit cards will enable transactions across more than 150 million merchants worldwide and cash access through hundreds of thousands of ATMs.\n\nIn an Australian first for small business banking, the 16-digit card number will not appear anywhere on the debit card. This will provide greater security for AMP Bank customers and reflect global advancements in digital-first banking. By removing visible card numbers, small businesses will be less susceptible to fraud and scams while being able to securely and easily access their card details through the new bank app for transactions where card details are required.\n\nThe new AMP Bank app will include other new security features, such as advanced fraud and scam protection systems to protect customers and multimodal biometric authentication. Customers will be encouraged to use face ID and fingerprint ID to enter the app and be prompted to record a video selfie when they first sign up, which helps prevent identity theft.\n\nSean O\u2019Malley, AMP Bank Group Executive, said, \u201cAMP Bank is excited to partner with Mastercard as we prepare to launch what we\u2019re confident will be Australia\u2019s leading digital banking experience. We all know that banks simply must do a better job of supporting the millions of small businesses operating across Australia. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve developed a new mobile banking platform with leading tech that is proven to make it easier and safer for business owners to operate and administer their businesses.\u201d\n\nRichard Wormald, Division President, Australasia at Mastercard, said, \u201cWith side hustles booming, many Australians are looking for a solution that works for both their personal and business lives. Mastercard is proud to partner with AMP Bank to deliver these new safeguards to Australian entrepreneurs, empowering them to spend less time worrying about fraud and scams, and more time focusing on what they do best.\u201d",

The key objectives are to grow SHF profits, improve post-harvest processes and expand access to finance through interventions focused on market access, capacity and skills development and creation of a blended finance facility.\n\nThe baseline study served the dual objectives of both learning and accountability. It provides baseline values for indicators in the logical framework and outlines lessons relevant for ongoing implementation. The baseline will be used by the planned mid-term and final evaluations to assess relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and impact of Shora Neza. Although the project was initiated in March 2022, delays in initial implementation led to this baseline study being undertaken from June 2023 to July 2024.\n\nBoth quantitative and qualitative primary data was collected for the baseline, from project participants (smallholder farmers and farmer service centres) and key stakeholders. A longitudinal study design was developed, with the baseline serving as the starting point for periodic quantitative outcome data collection over the five-year implementation period.\n\nKey findings\n\nThe programme design and approach is highly relevant to the needs and priorities of smallholder farmers and agri-preneurs, including youth and women. In practice, the targeting process faced challenges due to selection criteria and limited candidate pools.\n\nShora Neza aligns well with national priorities and policies and is complementary to objectives and initiatives of UN agencies, NGOs, and private sector partners operating in the agriculture and youth development space in Rwanda. However, gaps were identified in establishing systematic engagement strategies with private sector partners and in joint monitoring and follow up.\n\nThe programme incorporates strategies for long-term impact, such as capacity building, financial literacy, establishing lasting networks and market linkages. However, it lacks comprehensive risk analysis and contingency planning.\n\nWhile the program shows a commitment to gender equality and women's empowerment, there are notable gaps in mainstreaming disability inclusion and addressing the needs of other marginalized groups.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe programme shows strong relevance, coherence, and commitment to sustainability. Its targeted approach and alignment with national and international priorities lay a solid foundation for long-term impact. However, improvements are needed in selection processes, coordination, and risk management. The programme must also enhance its inclusivity strategies to ensure comprehensive support for all marginalized groups. Monitoring mechanisms to track implementation progress against plans were limited at the time of the baseline, and systematic feedback processes were not yet established.\n\nKey lessons",

If you\u2019re looking to build or rehabilitate your credit, a credit card can be a stepping stone to a stronger score.\n\nCredit cards for bad credit connect people with credit options that work for their financial situation. Low or no credit doesn\u2019t need to immobilize you. Numerous card options can help you build your credit.\n\nWhat credit score is needed for a credit card?\n\nA credit score of 660 or more is typically the eligibility threshold for most credit cards. You can still qualify for a credit card with a lower score, but your card options may be limited. Certain types of credit cards, like prepaid or secured cards, are designed for those with low or no credit.\n\nWhat is a credit score and how is it calculated?\n\nA credit score is a three-digit number \u2014 typically between 300 to 900 \u2014 that represents your creditworthiness. The higher your score, the more creditworthy you appear in the eyes of potential lenders. Your score is generated from your credit report by the two major Canadian credit bureaus: Equifax and TransUnion.\n\nThe credit bureaus collect information about your payment history from your creditors. They then use this information to calculate your credit score..\n\nCredit scoring models aren\u2019t publicly available, but generally speaking, here\u2019s how credit scores tend to be categorized:\n\nCredit rating Credit score range Poor 300-599. Fair 600-659. Good 660-724. Very good 725-759. Excellent 760-900.\n\nWhat is a bad credit score in Canada?\n\nA credit score below 600 is considered poor. A score in this range will make qualifying for an unsecured credit card difficult, if not impossible. Even a score of 600 to 659 \u2014 fair, by most scoring standards \u2014 may result in card denial.\n\nFinancial events and factors that may result in a lower credit score include:\n\nLate bill payments.\n\nLittle to no credit history.\n\nToo few credit accounts.\n\nForeclosures, bankruptcies and delinquencies.\n\nPast-due accounts being transferred to collections agencies.\n\nConsistently using most or all of your available credit.\n\nOpening numerous new accounts in a short period of time.\n\nToo many different types of credit accounts and not a good mix of debt (credit cards, loans, mortgages, etc.).\n\nHow can you tell if you have bad credit?\n\nYou can check your credit score by contacting Equifax or TransUnion or using a third-party financial service.\n\nEquifax\n\nEquifax offers online access to your credit score and report when you sign up for a free online subscription. You can also submit a request by phone, by mail or in person and receive a paper copy by mail. You should expect to receive your credit information within five to 10 business days following the request.\n\nTransUnion\n\nYou can access your credit report \u2014 which TransUnion calls a consumer disclosure \u2014 for free through TransUnion\u2019s website. If you live in Quebec, you\u2019ll find your credit score included in your consumer disclosure. Canadians outside of Quebec must sign up for TransUnion\u2019s subscription-based credit monitoring service for $24.95 monthly to see their credit score. This service includes email updates of changes to your credit score, personalized debt analysis and up to $1,000,000 in ID restoration insurance.\n\nThird-party personal finance service or bank\n\nOutside the two major Canadian credit bureaus, you may also be able to check your credit score through a third-party financial service. A number of major Canadian banks, including BMO, CIBC, RBC and Scotiabank, offer credit score access via their online banking platforms and mobile apps.\n\nHow long do bad credit events stay on your report?\n\nNegative credit events typically stay on your credit report for six to seven years \u2014 though this may fluctuate depending on the nature and severity of the incident, as well as your location. For example, if you live in Prince Edward Island, bankruptcy may stay on your report for up to 10 years.\n\nEasiest types of credit cards to get approved for in Canada\n\nFor those with poor credit, certain types of credit cards may be easier to access than others.\n\nType How it works Chances of approval Deposit required Builds credit history? Secured Requires a cash deposit and builds credit history. High. Yes. Yes. Prepaid (not a line of credit) Money is loaded onto the card and funds for transactions are withdrawn in real time. High. Yes. Typically no. Store Offered exclusively by retailers and can only be used at the affiliated store. Varies. No. Yes. Student Unsecured credit card, typically with a low credit limit, for students with limited credit history. High \u2014 but may be restricted to students. No. Yes. Newcomer Unsecured credit card, typically with a low credit limit, for Canadian newcomers with little to no credit history. High \u2014 but may be restricted to newcomers to Canada. No. Yes.\n\nSecured credit cards\n\nA secured credit card requires a cash deposit to open an account. The amount that you deposit typically becomes your credit limit. So, if you deposit $500, your credit limit will be $500. Secured cards work just like other credit cards. You can use them wherever credit cards are accepted, and you\u2019ll accrue interest on any outstanding balances.\n\nSecured credit cards give card issuers peace of mind because if you fail to pay your bill on time, they will take money from your initial security deposit to repay the balance. In this way, these cards are secured by the initial deposit you make when you open your account \u2014 hence the name. These cards differ from traditional credit cards, also called unsecured cards, which aren\u2019t secured by any form of deposit.\n\nIf you consistently pay your bill on time, one of the best secured cards in Canada can help you build your credit and improve your score. Plus, you\u2019ll get your initial deposit back when you close your account.\n\nWhich makes sense for you? Secured vs. Unsecured Credit Cards: How to Choose\n\nPrepaid cards\n\nA prepaid card is sort of like a debit card: you load money onto your card and spend the balance when you make a purchase.\n\nTransactions charged to a prepaid card are withdrawn from available funds in real time. Unlike a traditional credit card, a prepaid card won\u2019t help you build your credit score because your transactions aren\u2019t typically reported to the credit bureaus, so your credit history and score aren\u2019t impacted by using the card.\n\nSo, why get a prepaid card? Well, you can use them wherever traditional credit cards are accepted, and the best prepaid cards earn rewards or boast other special features. Plus, they don\u2019t require a credit check, which means those with low or no credit are eligible to apply.\n\nStore credit cards\n\nStore credit cards \u2014 also called retail credit cards \u2014 are cards offered exclusively by retailers. You can only use these cards at the associated store, but they tend to provide appealing perks and rewards.\n\nStudent credit cards\n\nStudent cards are unsecured cards that often have low or no annual fees and attractive perks, like rewards and insurance coverage. While many entry-level unsecured credit cards may be suitable for students, some issuers specifically offer official student-branded credit cards that have fewer criteria for acceptance.\n\nTo qualify for these official student cards, you must be the age of majority in your province or territory \u2014 no credit check required. You may be asked to demonstrate that you\u2019re a post-secondary student by providing proof of enrollment. You\u2019ll begin building your credit history as you use one of the best student credit cards.\n\nNewcomer credit cards\n\nRecently moved to Canada? Finding a credit card as a newcomer with no Canadian credit score or history may feel like a daunting task. But each of the Big Six banks in Canada \u2014 BMO, CIBC, National Bank, RBC, Scotiabank and TD Bank \u2014 offer credit cards specifically designed for newcomers.\n\nThese cards typically don\u2019t require an established credit history to apply.. Many newcomer cards boast the same perks and rewards programs as traditional credit cards.\n\nEligible applicants must be the age of majority in the province or territory where they live and must provide some personal information, like their date of birth, residential address and Social Insurance Number. Sometimes, proof of status as a Canadian newcomer, like a Canadian Permanent Resident Card, confirmation of Permanent Residence, or a work or study permit, is required.\n\nCards for Canadian newcomers tend to have lower credit limits \u2014 often ranging between $5,000 to $15,000.\n\nEstablishing your credit score as a newcomer to Canada\n\nSome financial institutions may accept credit history from outside of Canada, but this isn\u2019t always the case. So, one of the best ways to build your credit score as a newcomer to Canada is to apply for a credit card. Credit cards establish your credit history and contribute to your credit report. Payment and credit history can have a big impact on your credit score, so don\u2019t delay.\n\nLoan and line of credit payments also contribute to your credit history, so don\u2019t be shy about having more than one credit product. So long as you pay your bills on time, you\u2019ll be well on your way to building your Canadian credit history and getting one of the best credit cards available.\n\nGuaranteed approval for credit cards for bad credit\n\nGuaranteed approval credit cards guarantee your card approval as long as you meet the eligibility criteria. Cards with guaranteed approval are rare and are typically secured credit cards.\n\nEligibility criteria for these cards typically include the following:\n\nCanadian residency.\n\nAge of majority in your province or territory.\n\nMinimum security deposit requirements.\n\nCredit cards for fair credit Canada\n\nMost unsecured cards require a credit score of at least 660 to qualify, but there are some cards open to people in the fair credit score range. If you have fair credit, you\u2019ll find fewer cards to choose from, but if you use your card responsibly, your score will improve and more card options will become available over time.\n\nHow to compare credit cards for bad credit\n\nConsider the following before you fill out a credit card application:\n\nCredit check. If you don\u2019t feel confident about your score, seek a card that doesn\u2019t require a credit check.\n\nEligibility criteria. Some credit cards for low or no credit are strictly limited to those who meet certain eligibility criteria, like newcomers to Canada or post-secondary school students.\n\nDeposit . A card that requires a deposit may be easier to qualify for but could be a dealbreaker for those who don\u2019t have the necessary funds on hand.\n\nCard features. Insurance, rewards, travel perks, interest rates \u2014 no two credit cards are the same, so consider benefits and features to find the card best suited to your lifestyle.\n\nHow to apply for a credit card with bad credit\n\nFinding the credit card that works best for your financial situation can help you rebuild your credit and improve your credit score.\n\nHere\u2019s how to apply for a credit card with bad credit:\n\nKnow your credit score. Your credit score is important information that will help you make an informed decision about the card you pursue. With it, you\u2019ll be able to target cards you have a chance of being approved for and avoid an application rejection, which could harm your score. Get your credit score from your bank or one of the credit bureaus. Explore your options. Secured and prepaid cards are both viable choices for someone with bad credit. These cards will have different credit limits, interest rates and perks, so weigh your options carefully. Complete an application. No matter how eager you are to get a credit card, try to limit yourself to a single card application at a time. Card applications impact your credit score and multiple applications could act as a red flag for providers and hurt your chances of approval.\n\nDoes applying for a credit card affect your credit score?\n\nApplying for a credit card can negatively affect your score. Each time you submit a credit card application, the card issuer must perform a hard credit inquiry. These hard credit checks can drop your score by a few points, regardless of whether you\u2019re approved or not.\n\nDo multiple credit cards affect your credit score?\n\nWhether having multiple credit cards will positively or negatively impact your score depends more on how you use them than how many you carry. Having more than one credit card increases your combined credit limit. So long as you don\u2019t max out both cards, the increased credit limit means your credit utilization ratio will drop, which can positively impact your credit score.\n\nThat said, you may run into trouble if you have multiple cards that you consistently keep at or near their credit limit. Failing to pay your credit card bill on time will also hurt your score.\n\nA good rule of thumb when you carry multiple cards is to keep your credit utilization low \u2014 30% of your overall limit or less \u2014 and automate your card payments so you never fall behind.\n\n6 ways to improve credit score\n\nIf you have a bad credit score, don\u2019t panic. There are numerous ways to improve your credit.\n\nGet a credit card to rebuild credit. A credit card can help you rehabilitate your credit score, so long as you use it responsibly and consistently pay your bill on time. Limit your credit applications. Whether it\u2019s a card or another form of credit, like a loan, limit your applications to avoid too many hard credit checks on your record. Also: numerous applications may look suspicious in the eyes of your potential lenders. Automate your payments. Missed or late payments can have a huge impact on your credit score. Consider automating your monthly bill payments \u2014 utilities, mobile phone, student loans \u2014 all of these impact your credit score. Use less than 30% of your available credit. Keeping your credit utilization low can have a positive impact on your credit score. Check your credit report for inaccuracies. Sometimes lenders get it wrong, which means there could be inaccuracies in your credit report. You can dispute these inaccuracies and have them corrected. Keep old accounts open. If you have old accounts you\u2019ve paid off, consider leaving them open. The longer your credit history, the better. Keep old accounts active by using them every so often and immediately pay off what you owe. If you have to close your account, make sure you cancel your credit card the right way.\n\nHow long does it take for your credit score to change?\n\nCredit reports are typically updated once every 30 to 90 days. Your credit score will change based on the information in your credit report. Each new piece of information added to your report has the potential to impact your credit score.",

            "content": "Large businesses have less than two weeks left to opt into a \u2018multi-billion pound lawsuit\u2019 against payment giants Visa and Mastercard, commercial litigation firm Harcus Parker has warned.\n\nHarcus Parker is arguing that businesses were unlawfully charged multilateral interchange fees (MIFS) on transactions \u2013 because these fees were set by the Visa and Mastercard card schemes themselves and not through a process of market competition.\n\nWhenever a customer pays a merchant by card, the merchant\u2019s bank will pay a multilateral interchange fee to the cardholder\u2019s bank. This fee makes up the largest part of the \u2018Merchant Service Charge\u2019, which the merchant\u2019s bank will charge the merchant in return for the right to accept card payment.\n\n\u201cMIFs are like a tax on businesses and charities, increasing the cost of accepting commercial card payments,\u201d explains Stephen Allen, director of the Class Representatives. \u201cThis claim enables justice for years of being squeezed by these global card schemes.\n\n\u201cThe thousands of people who donate online or support UK charity shops will be shocked and disappointed to learn how much money charities have lost because of excessive card fees. We hope Mastercard and Visa will stop punishing charities who accept commercial card payments by removing these onerous fees.\u201d\n\nSince 2015, UK law has capped the level of MIFs at 0.3 per cent on consumer credit transactions, and 0.3 per cent for consumer credit card transactions. These capped fees, however, exceed the competitive level of charge. For every \u00a3100 transaction, up to \u00a30.30 is unlawfully overcharged by Mastercard and Visa on payments made by credit and debit cards.\n\nBusinesses with an annual pre-Covid turnover of \u00a3100million or more were first invited to join the \u2018opt-in\u2019 claim in September 2024 \u2013 but now, the deadline to do so (Monday 10 February) is looming.\n\nProtecting businesses\n\nBecause Harcus Parker believes MIF is set in breach of competition law and causes businesses to bear unnecessary cost, it filed claims in the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), the UK\u2019s specialist competition court, on behalf of all merchants processing payments in the UK, seeking substantial damages.\n\nOn 9 August 2024, CAT granted the Collective Proceedings Order (CPO) authorising the Proposed Class Representative to continue the claim as a class action on behalf of eligible UK merchants.\n\nBusinesses with an annual pre-Covid turnover of under \u00a3100million are automatically included in the claim, unless they specifically choose to opt out. Businesses that choose not to be a part of either or both of the \u2018opt-out\u2019 claims against Mastercard and Visa, will not then be eligible to receive any compensation if this becomes available.\n\nThe claim runs from June 2016 to date. Damages continue to accrue until the date of judgment or settlement (plus interest) \u2013 meaning, if the lawsuit proves successful, Visa and Mastercard could be forced to pay billions in compensation.\n\nJeremy Robinson, partner at Harcus Parker Limited, representing the Class Representatives, added: \u201cHundreds of larger UK firms have just two weeks left to join this claim and seek their due compensation from Mastercard and Visa. Class action litigation is the best way to ensure Mastercard and Visa stop these unlawful charges on businesses.\u201d",

            "content": "More than 3,000 business and government leaders, academics and artists gathered in the mostly snow-less Swiss Alps for the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual summit in Davos under the banner \u201cCollaboration for the Intelligent Age\u201d last week. And while all eyes were on Washington with the U.S. inauguration, the discussions on the ground emphasized the need to drive forward digital transformation \u2014 from agentic AI to blockchain to the commercialization of these technologies \u2014 that benefits everyone.\n\n\u201cIn a day and age where you\u2019ve got ... a disaggregated world, you want something that protects you,\u201d said Jon Huntsman, Mastercard\u2019s president of Strategic Growth, at a panel on stemming financial fragmentation. \u201cWe have spent a lot of money on consumer protection, on cyber, on tokenization \u2026 that allows us to gain critical insights and intelligence on who\u2019s got your information, who might be a bad actor, and how to avoid that.\u201d\n\nAI remains atop the agenda\n\nArtificial intelligence continued to dominate discussions \u2014 both its \u201cstunning technology possibility,\u201d in the words of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and the \u201cepic challenge\u201d it poses for governments all over the world. Leaders discussed a number of those challenges they needed to address, including how they could meet the demands for energy and computer chips that heavy use of AI requires.\n\nAdditionally, they\u2019ll have to confront a potential \u201ccrisis of truth\u201d that AI could exacerbate, as Pope Francis characterized it in a written address, and find ways to upskill employees for the age of AI \u2014 even as a WEF survey earlier this month revealed that 41% of employers globally plan to downsize their workforce by 2030 due to AI automation. In fact, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said that the chief executives gathered in this Swiss village would be the last generation to manage all-human workforces.\n\nEven as participants discussed the big issues of the day, they didn\u2019t lose sight of the little things that are foundational to digital alignment and collaboration. Described by one participant as \u201cinspired dullness,\u201d a continued drive towards common standards came up frequently.\n\nFor small businesses, AI could be a gamechanger, but panelists acknowledged there are challenges in bringing those benefits to resource-strapped entrepreneurs. \u201cThere's mistrust around technology. There's time poverty. There's a sense of overload in terms of where to start,\u201d says Payal Dalal, an executive vice president for global programs at the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, at a panel hosted by the Center on driving resilience for small businesses in an AI-driven world.\n\n\u201cAnd finally,\u201d she continued, \u201csmall businesses don't know how AI can really help them save time and make money. So really understanding what the needs of the small businesses are and then figuring out how AI can help as opposed to just pushing AI towards small businesses is the way forward.\u201d\n\nAnd in a piece for the WEF Agenda blog published as the summit opened, Ling Hai, Mastercard\u2019s president for Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, highlighted how partnerships across the public sector, nonprofit and private sector are essential to accelerating the digital journeys of small businesses, which can boost economies and drive greater inclusion and resilience.\n\nTrust must be foundational\n\nIn addition to AI, the rise of cybersecurity risks was a major topic of discussion at WEF this year. As attacks are growing in scope and scale, small businesses need help, Ling Hai wrote. \u201cGiven the pressures of running a small business, it is impossible to expect owners to keep track of the latest updates or research the best network monitoring software, but trust with customers that has taken years to build can be shattered in seconds by a cybersecurity breach.\u201d\n\nA new report by WEF released earlier in January on the state of cybersecurity pointed to the growing complexity of cyberspace, which is widening the opportunity gap between large and small organizations, and deepening the economic divide between developed and emerging economies.\n\nCollaborative action, particularly between the private and public sector, is needed to ensure \u201cwe can bring innovation and data in the context of AI along, so that we can ensure that the Global South is well protected for future generations,\u201d said Kiki Del Valle, Mastercard division president for North Latin America at a panel convened by ODI and Mastercard on leadership in an era of weakened multilateralism.\n\nAnother worrying finding of the survey: About 35% of small organizations believe their cyber resilience is inadequate, a proportion that has increased sevenfold since 2022. Meanwhile, many more large organizations are reporting that they believe they have enough cyber protections.\n\n\u201cSafety and security, right now, is one of the biggest threats that face us globally,\u201d said Linda Kirkpatrick, Mastercard\u2019s Americas president, who joined a panel on the WEF mainstage on the future of the economy in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n\u201cOne positive outcome of the pandemic was that our small businesses, our consumers, got comfortable in a digitized environment,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want everyone to have access, and we want access to drive usage. At the same time, that advancement in digitization can lead to risk in the system in the form of cyberattacks. Safety and security, right now, is one of the biggest threats that face us globally. We need to unify around a common goal to protect our digital ecosystem.\"",

We expect GDV from domestic operations to increase by almost 8.1% year over year and 10% in international operations. Increasing strength in Latin American and European operations is likely to have driven the metric.\n\nSwitched transactions are expected to have experienced an upsurge, driven by resilient consumer spending and increased contactless acceptance initiatives pursued by the payment technology company.

As such, the consensus estimate for cross-border assessments suggests an increase of 19.9% compared with the previous year, while our projection indicates growth of 21.8%. Further, our model predicts domestic assessments and transaction processing assessments to witness an 11.5% and 12.2% year-over-year increase, respectively.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Value-added Services and Solutions net revenues indicates 17.2% year-over-year growth, while our model estimate suggests an 18.2% increase in the fourth quarter. Continued demand for its consulting and marketing services and loyalty solutions is likely to have driven this metric.\n\nWhile the above-mentioned factors are expected to have positioned the company for growth from the past year, rising expenses, and rebates and incentives are likely to have partially offset the positives, making an earnings beat uncertain.\n\nMastercard\u2019s adjusted operating costs are likely to have increased in the fourth quarter due to higher G&A costs and Advertising & Marketing expenses, potentially hampering its profitability. We expect total adjusted operating expenses to increase 13.8% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s actuals. Furthermore, our estimate for payments network rebates and incentives suggests a 19% year-over-year increase.\n\nMastercard\u2019s Price Performance & Valuation\n\nMastercard's stock has exhibited an upward movement over the past year. However, its gain of 21.1% has underperformed the industry\u2019s growth of 23.9%. In comparison, its peers like Visa Inc. V and American Express Company AXP have gained 20.6% and 60%, respectively, during this time. Additionally, Mastercard has lagged the S&P 500, which has gained 24.8% during the same period.\n\nPrice Performance \u2013 MA, V, AXP, Industry & S&P 500\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the value Mastercardoffers investors at current levels.\n\nThe company\u2019s valuation looks stretched compared with the industry average. Currently, Mastercard is trading at 32.45X forward 12 months earnings, above its five-year median of 31.67X and the industry\u2019s average of 25.46X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn comparison, Visa is attractively valued, trading at 28.30X forward 12-months earnings. American Express is trading at 20.85X, offering a better value at the moment.\n\nHow Should You Play Mastercard Ahead of Q4 Earnings?\n\nMastercard continues to demonstrate strong growth, driven by an increase in processed transactions and GDV. The robust performance of its Value-Added Services and Solutions segment highlights the success of its diversification strategy. With a focus on digital innovation and expansion in emerging markets like Southeast Asia and Latin America, Mastercard is well-positioned for sustained long-term growth.\n\nThe company's strategic investments and global partnerships underscore its commitment to broadening its network and maintaining its leadership in the payments industry. Additionally, MA's strong cash position supports significant share buybacks, dividend payouts and inorganic growth, ensuring financial stability and value for current shareholders.\n\nHowever, short-term challenges may weigh on the stock. Rising costs, increased incentives, regulatory pressures and ongoing lawsuits across domestic and international markets could limit margin growth. The Credit Card Competition Act of 2023 also poses potential risks. While business-friendly policies under President Donald Trump could provide some relief, the evolving regulatory environment remains a factor to watch.\n\nWhile Mastercard's long-term growth prospects remain solid, now may not be the ideal time to buy. Existing shareholders can continue to benefit from the company\u2019s initiatives, but potential investors might prefer to wait for a more attractive entry point,considering valuation concerns limiting near-term gains.\n\nZacks' Research Chief Names \"Stock Most Likely to Double\"\n\nOur team of experts has just released the 5 stocks with the greatest probability of gaining +100% or more in the coming months.

            "content": "Ally Bank is selling its credit card business to CardWorks. But for now, there are no changes to any of Ally\u2019s credit cards. An Ally Bank spokesperson confirmed that all three cards are still accepting applications and that existing cardholders can continue to use their cards and make payments the same way they do now. The bank says they will communicate any changes that require action, if any, to consumers.\n\nAlly Bank offers a suite of three credit cards, which are currently available by invitation-only regardless of whether you're an Ally banking customer. In some ways, the cards are competitive with similar credit card products from larger institutions. However, the lack of a sign-up bonus on any of the Ally credit card offerings could mean missing out on valuable rewards.\n\nIf you\u2019ve considered adding an Ally credit card to your wallet, here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nNeed a new credit card? Let us do the work. Just answer a few simple questions and we'll match you with the best cards for you, in minutes. Use the Quiz Terms and conditions apply. Credit products subject to lender approval.\n\n1. There are multiple Ally cards\n\nAlly Bank currently offers three different credit cards, each with its own rewards structure and fee. When you receive an invitation to apply for an Ally credit card, that invitation will apply to a specific card, so it's important to understand which card you're eligible for.\n\nThe Ally Platinum Mastercard is a $0-annual-fee card marketed toward consumers who are building credit. This straightforward card comes with no rewards, sign-up bonus, or introductory annual percentage rate (APR), but it advertises automatic reviews for opportunities to increase your credit line.\n\nThe Ally Unlimited Cash Back Mastercard is a $0-annual-fee card that offers an unlimited flat rate 2% cash back on all purchases.\n\nThe Ally Everyday Cash Back Mastercard is a tiered-rewards credit card that earns an unlimited 3% cash back at gas stations, grocery stores, and drugstores and 1% back on all other purchases. This card may carry an annual fee between $0-$39, depending on the applicant\u2019s credit profile.\n\nAll three cards carry a variable interest rate between 19.99%-29.99%, with no option for an introductory interest rate as of August 2023.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip On its website, Ally advertises an additional Unlimited Cash Back card for nurses and teachers. However, all features, benefits, and rates of this card appear to be identical to the general-purpose Ally Unlimited Cash Back card.\n\n2. Ally credit cards are currently available by invitation only\n\nCurrently, Ally credit cards aren\u2019t open to the general public. To apply, you first need to receive an invitation, usually by direct mail. Each invitation applies only to a specific card, so unless you\u2019ve received multiple offers from Ally, you won\u2019t be able to shop among cards.\n\nInvitations are being issued both to current customers of Ally Bank and to nonbank customers. According to a representative, though, the bank plans to open credit card applications to the general public in the future.\n\n3. Annual fees vary depending on the card and applicant\n\nThere\u2019s no annual fee for either the Ally Platinum Mastercard or the Ally Unlimited Cash Back Mastercard. However, the annual fee for the Ally Everyday Cash Back Mastercard can range from $0-$39, depending on the applicant\u2019s credit profile. Check the terms of your offer before applying to confirm whether an annual fee will apply to your account.\n\n4. There\u2019s no cap on cash back\n\nBoth the Ally Everyday Cash Back Mastercard and the Ally Unlimited Cash Back Mastercard have no limit to the total cash back you can earn. That\u2019s not uncommon among flat rate 2% cash back earning cards like the Ally Unlimited Cash Back Mastercard. Both the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card and the Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card earn an unlimited 2% cash back with no annual fee. (For the Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card that's in the form of 1% cash back when you buy, plus an additional 1% as you pay for those purchases.)\n\nBut the lack of an earnings cap is a relatively rare perk of the Ally Everyday Cash Back Mastercard, which earns 3% back at gas stations, grocery stores, and drugstores. Most cards that earn 3% back or more in these categories come with either a quarterly or annual spending cap, or a much higher annual fee.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Don\u2019t expect a sign-up bonus or introductory APR\n\nA notable downside of the Ally credit cards is they don't come with any sort of sign-up bonus or introductory APR. That means by choosing these cards over a different card, you could be leaving valuable savings on the table.\n\nFor example, compare the Ally Everyday Cash Back Mastercard with the Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card. Both earn 3% back on purchases at grocery stores. But the Savor card also comes with no annual fee, 0% introductory APR offers and an enticing bonus: Earn a one-time $200 cash bonus once you spend $500 on purchases within the first 3 months from account opening.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

This prepaid card will enable Money Fellows to offer financial planning, savings, and credit access to its users in Egypt.\n\nDriven by a shared commitment to advancing financial inclusion, Mastercard, Banque Misr and Money Fellows collaborate to enhance financial accessibility and improve user experience in Egypt, where 71.5% of the population is formally included in the financial system.

Blockchain analyst Ali Martinez maintains that the token is primed for a major price move.\n\nIf Avalanche can break out of its current trading range of $33 to $37, Martinez sees the potential for a not-too-shabby 40% upswing. Increasing institutional adoption and sufficient expectations concerning the potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize the financial sector seem to be feeding a growth narrative around Avalanche.\n\n#Avalanche $AVAX is prime for a 40% price move once it breaks outside of the $37\u2013$33 range! pic.twitter.com/VBnjJoigbz \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) January 23, 2025\n\nMastercard recently put out an informative report that emphasizes the benefits of tokenization and the pivotal role Avalanche plays in correcting inefficiencies in financial systems, especially in Latin America (LATAM). The financial behemoth\u2019s report is a significant advancement in the recognition of blockchain technology by the establishment and the potential it has to revolutionize \u201cdinosaur\u201d financial services. As the financial landscape keeps morphing, Avalanche stands as a significant player in this transformation.\n\nAvalanche\u2019s Key Role in Financial Modernization\n\nThe report from Mastercard spotlights the asset tokenization opportunity\u2014one that\u2019s projected to reach $10 trillion by 2030. \u201cTokenization,\u201d the report notes, \u201ccan bring substantial cost reductions and may eliminate intermediaries, resulting in tokens that are ex- pected to unlock new opportunities for financial institutions and individuals.\u201d Positioned here, Avalanche is supposedly a perfect fit for institutions seeking to carry out asset tokenization.\n\nThe network of Avalanche is particularly appealing because of its customizable Layer 1 (L1) solutions, which are tailored to meet the specific needs of institutional clients. That is a key advantage, because financial institutions want \u201csolutions [that] are adaptable to their [unique] requirements.\u201d With its scalable, efficient, and cost-effective L1 (and L2) blockchain solutions, Avalanche is an ideal candidate to become the go-to startup for institutions trying to enter the blockchain space.\n\nThe report from Mastercard underscores the natural interoperability of Avalanche\u2019s blockchain, which guarantees effortless communication across various chains. This interoperability is vital for the widespread acceptance of blockchain technology. It enables organizations to work with a range of networks and ecosystems without hitting the kinds of roadblocks associated with siloed blockchain systems. As well, Avalanche\u2019s scalability means that organizations can process huge transaction volumes without any drop in speed or reliability.\n\nMastercard just released their report on the benefits of tokenization in Latin America, highlighting how the Avalanche network addresses inefficiencies and expands financial access for the unbanked. Read the full report to discover how Avalanche is reshaping finance in LATAM and\u2026 https://t.co/kYlZtUmYyY \u2014 Avalanche\ud83d\udd3a (@avax) January 22, 2025\n\nUnlocking Efficiency and Financial Inclusion\n\nMastercard has pointed out one of the most significant advantages of Avalanche: its ability to enable faster transactions. In contrast to the traditional financial system, which requires 1 to 3 days to settle transactions, Avalanche settles in seconds. This results not only in the freeing up of capital that would otherwise be tied up in clearing processes but also in something that could be of this situation\u2019s concern and interest: the potential for substantial cost savings to be passed along to consumers and businesses.\n\nIn addition, Avalanche is tackling the problem head-on to improve the never-ending situation of financial inclusion, mainly in areas like Latin America, where vast numbers of the populace lack bank access. Underbanked populations are particularly vulnerable to remitter and predatory fees charged by payday lenders and cash-for-check services. Rising to the challenge, we in the Avalanche community are committed to lowering the barriers to financial services. Blockchain technology and tokenization price a whole new frontier of accessible financial opportunities for individuals who have been locked out of the market. By enabling fractional ownership, tokenization allows these individuals to gain access to real estate and the private equity market\u2014opportunities that were once the sole purview of high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors.\n\nA major reason why global investors are interested in Avalanche is its potential to help achieve financial inclusion. The cryptocurrency system predominantly used today, Bitcoin, is not efficient and not cheap. But the Avalanche platform is potentially something else again: a mainstream financial technology that works, at low cost, in places where traditional banking doesn\u2019t.\n\nPrivacy and Security for Institutions\n\nMastercard\u2019s report highlights another notable aspect of Avalanche: its attention to privacy. For institutions that make protecting sensitive data a priority, Avalanche offers customizable Layer 1 solutions via its AvaCloud platform. These privacy-centric solutions allow institutions to realize the full potential of blockchain technology while ensuring that their data remains secure and confidential. The need for privacy solutions is only going to increase, and Avalanche seems to be well-positioned to satisfy that demand.\n\nThe increasing interest from institutional players in Avalanche highlights the potential of the network to spearhead the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. As Mastercard\u2019s report indicates, Avalanche offers the tools and infrastructure that these institutions can use to scale their operations, making it an appealing choice for the types of financial services that want to seize the upside of tokenization and blockchain.\n\n$AVAX and the Road Ahead\n\nAvalanche is seeing a growing institutional interest, and that\u2019s very good news as it approaches a critical juncture. With scalability and a shared vision of blockchain-based financial services, Avalanche is very much an underappreciated storyline in this broader crypto narrative, and the not-so-distant potential for an $AVAX breakout very much underscores that.\n\nTo sum up, the Avalanche network\u2019s capacity to tackle inefficiencies, lower transaction costs, and broaden financial access makes it a frontrunner in the blockchain realm. Mastercard\u2019s report adds to the already present impetus behind tokenization and reinforces the notion that Avalanche is sculpting the future of financial services. Meanwhile, $AVAX continues to attract both institutional investors and the next-generation financial services sector, setting the stage for more pronounced growth and adoption in the months ahead. Undoubtedly, the network has long-term potential. How much and in what form will it express that potential?\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Mastercard's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nNYSE:MA Earnings and Revenue Growth January 24th 2025\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Mastercard. Our data shows that The MasterCard Foundation, Endowment Arm is the largest shareholder with 10.0% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.4% and 7.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\n\nA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 17 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.",

            "content": "Visa and Mastercard have been accused of serious cases against their role in facilitating payments linked to illegal content on the adult website, OnlyFans.\n\nAccording to allegations, by a compliance-experienced whistleblower, these two credit card giants did nothing to prevent the illicit activities happening on the platform, such as child sexual abuse material and sex trafficking.\n\nWhistleblower Complaint Reveals Serious Allegations\n\nA senior compliance expert in the banking and credit card industries has filed a whistleblower complaint against Visa and Mastercard with the financial crimes unit of the U.S. Treasury, known as FinCEN, citing that both card companies continue to process payments for illegal content on OnlyFans despite repeated warnings. The whistleblower, Reuters reports, knew as of 2021 that such activities were being done.\n\nThe complaint reveals that payment networks deliberately avoided implementing proper anti-money laundering technology to detect illegal monetary transactions\u2014they \"willfully failed\" in such implementation.\n\nThree US government departments including the Justice Department and Homeland Security Department and the US Treasury filed the complaint in January 2023.\n\nThe said complaint referenced a conversation between the federal agents and the credit card companies. It stated that the agents verified that there was child sexual abuse material existing on the said platform and showed them evidence of suspected sex trafficking.\n\nThe complaint submitted by the whistleblower claims that the two companies failed to act against the matter, given the concrete evidence.\n\nIllegal Content and Financial Transactions\n\nThe heart of the complaint centers around the financial transactions that Visa and Mastercard process on behalf of OnlyFans, a platform known for its subscription-based content model.\n\nWith millions of users and content creators, the site has garnered significant attention due to allegations of illegal content being uploaded, including sexually explicit material involving minors.\n\nShe cites the case of the direct handling of such proceeds by Visa and Mastercard, processing payments for the content creators monetizing these illicit videos and images. The responses to the allegations by both Visa and Mastercard are that they do not accept liability as they are compliant and take measures to ensure that their networks remain free of illegal activity.\n\nPressure on Tech Giants Over Illicit Content\n\nThough Visa and Mastercard have dismissed the claims, the pressure mounted by global regulators and law enforcement is undeniable. The U.S. government, among other international authorities, has questioned online platforms like OnlyFans over their facilitation of the sale of child sexual abuse material and engaging in other exploitation activities.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint is part of a larger movement toward holding companies accountable for their role in the spread of illegal content. This is not the first time that major payment providers have faced scrutiny over transactions tied to adult content platforms.\n\nIn 2020, Visa and Mastercard blocked transactions for Pornhub, another adult site, in response to similar allegations.\n\nMastercard and Visa's Compliance Efforts\n\nIn the wake of these allegations, Visa and Mastercard have pointed to their internal compliance efforts to prevent illegal activity. Visa asserts that it terminates relationships with any institutions or merchants that fail to meet its compliance standards, while Mastercard emphasizes that it works with its partners to act against identified illegal activities.\n\nDespite these claims, the whistleblower indicates that both parties have not effectively done much concerning the rampant proliferation of illegal content on OnlyFans.\n\nThe complaints also hint at the fact that the companies are prone to shifting the responsibility onto the banks, even though they continue to process payments related to illegal content.\n\nThe whistleblower goes on to point out that such \"business as usual\" behavior is symptomatic of a much bigger problem in the financial sector in relation to policing illicit online activities.",

Federal agents contacted Mastercard and Visa in 2021 and 2022, warning the companies about the unlawful content.\n\nThe whistleblower, who is also said to have assisted with a 2022 anti-trafficking study, found a \u201chigh volume\u201d of OnlyFans accounts linked to child pornography or sex trafficking.

            "content": "Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) is preparing to announce its fourth-quarter results next week, with analysts predicting strong revenue and earnings growth. The company has performed well in recent quarters, benefitting from changing trends in consumer spending amid inflation pressure and economic uncertainties.\n\nA month ago, the New York-headquartered payments behemoth\u2019s stock reached a new high. It has been gaining steadily since mid-2024, recovering from the weakness experienced in the first half of the year. In general, market watchers are bullish on the stock\u2019s prospects, with the average price target indicating a 10% growth in 12 months. For investors, it would be prudent to keep MA on their watchlists as it may continue to be a top-performing stock this year.\n\nEstimates\n\nIt is estimated that Mastercard\u2019s adjusted profit increased to $3.71 per share in the final three months of FY24 from $3.18 per share in Q4 2023. The growth reflects an anticipated 13% year-over-year increase in revenues to $7.38 billion in the fourth quarter. The company is expected to publish the report on Thursday, January 30, at 8:00 am ET.\n\nTravel spending has recovered steadily in the post-pandemic era, which often involves the use of credit cards. The inflation-induced shift to digital payments, with consumers choosing non-cash payment methods for essentials, has also contributed to the positive financial performance of credit card companies like Mastercard and Visa.\n\nAs part of its strategy to use crypto technologies to scale and to bring real-life use cases to consumers, Mastercard recently entered into a partnership with Stellar to integrate its Crypto Credential system into the latter\u2019s network.\n\nStrong Q3\n\nIn the third quarter, revenue increased 13% annually to $7.4 billion, exceeding estimates. Currency-neutral revenue growth was 14%. That translated into an increase in adjusted earnings to $3.89 per share in Q3 from $3.39 per share in the prior year period. Analysts were looking for a slower growth. Unadjusted profit was $3.3 billion or $3.53 per share, compared to $3.2 billion or $3.39 per share in Q3 2023.\n\nMastercard\u2019s CEO Michael Miebach said at the Q3 earnings call, \u201cThe labor market remained strong, even if slightly below historically tight levels. And, inflation has moderated, albeit at varied levels across categories and countries. Overall, we remain positive about our growth outlook, but we will continue to monitor the environment. We will continue to focus on the things we can control, and execute on our growth algorithm by tapping into the sizable secular shift opportunity to electronic payments, and that across both \u2018spend\u2019 and transactions.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Mastercard\u2019s stock opened slightly higher and maintained that momentum in the early hours of the session. The value has increased by a fifth over the past six months.",

According to our valuations, Virgin Atlantic points are worth around 2.6 cents each, making them one of the most valuable airline currencies. These points can be transferred to Virgin Red for hotel and cruise bookings for equal value, making the two programs essentially identical.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get 2X points in everyday spending categories like dining and groceries, along with select streaming services and EV charging stations, which amounts to a 5.2 percent return using our valuation. This rate is a decent return on your spending as long as you can use the rewards with the Virgin ecosystem or for booking a partner flight on a SkyTeam alliance partner.\n\nWelcome offer: Valuable bonus\n\nThe Virgin Red comes with a welcome offer of 40,000 Virgin points after spending $3,000 in the first 90 days, a 7.5 percent return on spending. Using Bankrate\u2019s valuations, the bonus is worth roughly $1,040, which is substantial as long as you can use the points. Other cards with a similar annual fee have welcome bonuses that fall well short of the value of this offer. However, points from these cards may provide more flexibility or involve lower minimum spending requirements.\n\nPerks: Exceptional additional value\n\nThe Virgin Red Reward card\u2019s strength lies in the flexibility and value of the perks added to offset its mid-tier $99 annual fee. You can earn up to 10,000 bonus points by adding authorized users with no spending requirements, which is a rare find. You\u2019ll also get 5,000 bonus points each year for renewing the card, which more than offsets the fee, as this works out to be up to $130 in value. Each year, you\u2019ll get a reward voucher (valid for 12 months) for a third consecutive night free with the purchase of a two-night stay at a participating Virgin hotel.\n\nThe card also provides excellent spending incentives. You can earn an additional 25 Tier Points after spending $2,500 up to twice each month. These extra points can help you reach the Silver tier at 400 points or the Gold tier at 1,000 points. Advancing to the higher tiers offers perks like bonus points on flights and additional in-flight benefits.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get to choose from these Personal Perks after spending $15,000 and $30,000 within a cardholder year:\n\nVirgin Atlantic Flying Club reward voucher for a round-trip companion seat or round-trip cabin upgrade\n\n1 Free Virgin Hotel night stay\n\nVirgin Hotels priority room upgrade\n\nVirgin Voyages bar tab credit (up to $300 value on cruises of 7 nights or more, up to $150 for less than 7 nights)\n\nVirgin Voyages Blue Extras perk package\n\nEach of these perks can provide substantial value, and the ability to choose up to two of them through card spending is a surprisingly valuable feature for a mid-level co-branded card.",

You won\u2019t pay an annual fee, but you do need to be a Co-op member\n\nThe REI Co-op\u00ae Mastercard\u00ae, issued by Capital One, doesn\u2019t charge an annual fee, but you do need to be a Co-op member to apply. For a one-time fee of $30, you\u2019ll get a lifetime membership which comes with:\n\nFree standard shipping.\n\nAbility to return most items for 365 days, even if you\u2019ve used them.\n\nA yearly member reward to spend at REI (usually, 10% of your eligible purchases on full-priced items for the year, but it\u2019s not guaranteed).\n\nAccess to extra sales on used gear.\n\nHaving to pay for membership before you can apply for the card is a little inconvenient. But if you buy most of your outdoor gear at REI, membership is well worth the cost. Consider this: Assuming REI doles out the full 10% member reward (which it usually does), you'll need to spend $300 total to cover the cost of membership.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip If your preferred name doesn\u2019t match your legal name, you can opt to use your preferred name on your REI Co-op\u00ae Mastercard\u00ae (your legal name will still show up in your account). But if you\u2019re asked by a merchant to verify your identity with your ID, they might need to call Capital One to complete the verification.\n\n2. You\u2019ll earn rich rewards wherever you spend money \u2026\n\nCardholders earn 5% back on REI purchases. Combined with the annual membership reward, you\u2019re looking at exceptional cash back earnings on purchases with the outdoor retailer. Plus, during a yearly double rewards event, you\u2019ll earn an extra 5% on REI purchases. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a better deal than that on outdoor gear.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nMost retail credit cards offer minimal value on purchases made outside that brand. Not so with the REI Co-op\u00ae Mastercard\u00ae, since all non-REI purchases earn 1.5% back. For REI loyalists who don\u2019t want to juggle multiple credit cards, using the REI Co-op\u00ae Mastercard\u00ae everywhere is a respectable way to rack up rewards to cover your next big outdoor purchase.\n\nIf you want a card that earns higher rewards on all purchases (and more flexibility when you redeem them), consider the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card, which earns 2% back on all purchases. Or, you could go with a two-card combination: use the REI Co-op\u00ae Mastercard\u00ae at the outdoor retailer and use the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card everywhere else.\n\n3. \u2026 But you can only redeem them at REI\n\nUnlike many credit cards that don't give access to the rewards you earn until the close of your billing cycle, rewards from the REI Co-op\u00ae Mastercard\u00ae show up in your account as you earn them. The rewards, though, can be redeemed for REI purchases only. This likely won\u2019t be a problem for outdoorsy people who purchase a lot of gear from the brand. But casual shoppers will likely be better off choosing a card with more flexible redemption options.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nFor instance, the rewards you earn with the Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card can be redeemed for cash back. Plus, its unique rewards structure could help you earn extra rewards on REI merchandise, as long as you purchase it online.\n\nWith the card, you\u2019ll earn 3% back on a category you choose from this list: gas stations/EV charging stations, online shopping, dining, travel, drugstores, home improvement/furnishings. Plus, you\u2019ll get 2% back on grocery stores and wholesale clubs and 1% back on everything else. Co-op members who choose online shopping as their 3% category could earn a total of 13% back on purchases made at REI.com.\n\nTravel Rewards Expert Reveals... Why this is her top credit card for dining rewards, and she shows you exactly how she realizes more than $1,000 in value from it each year. Click for details\n\n4. You\u2019ll get a solid introductory bonus plus yearly statement credit\n\nOnce you make a purchase outside of REI within the first 60 days after opening the card, you\u2019ll get a $100 REI gift card. That\u2019s a sizable sign-up bonus, considering that you don\u2019t need to spend a specific amount of money to get it.\n\nCardholders also get an annual $50 statement credit to use at on classes at select REI locations.\n\n5.

            "content": "According to a Tuesday court filing, Mastercard has agreed to pay $26 million to settle a proposed class action lawsuit which alleged it underpaid female, Black, and Hispanic employees, as per The New York Times.\n\nFour Masterard employees who previously worked at the company believed it had hired women and workers of color into lower-paying roles. Their suspicions grew as employees received fewer raises and promotions than white men doing similar work.\n\nAdditionally, the lawsuit charges Mastercard with violating federal laws banning pay discrimination and workplace sex and race bias.\n\nWhat does the settlement claim?\n\nThe settlement claims that the company has underpaid nearly 7,500 employees since 2016. However, Mastercard did not confess to any misconduct, but it did agree to an annual pay equity audit for three years and hire a psychologist to examine bias in its workplace.\n\nSeth Eisen, a spokesperson for the company, said it disagreed with the claims in the lawsuit; however, settling the case was in the best interest of all parties.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essential that we have a workplace where all employees feel valued, respected, and empowered to reach their greatest potential,\u201d Eisen said.\n\nHow will the settlement help future employees?\n\nCara Greene of Outten & Golden, who represents the plaintiffs, said the non-monetary terms of the settlement would help guarantee that Mastercard nurtures an equitable workplace for the women and people of color who the company employs.\n\n\u201cSettlements like this help to level the playing field and move the entire industry closer to pay equity,\u201d Greene added in a statement. The lawsuit found that in 2023, Mastercard\u2019s median pay for Black and Hispanic employees was 94.3% of that for white employees, but women earned 96.4% of reimbursement paid to their male colleagues.\n\nImage: WOCintech",

            "content": "The market expects MasterCard (MA) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 30. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis processor of debit and credit card payments is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $7.38 billion, up 12.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.42% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",

            "content": "Talking earlier this month at the annual CES new tech showcase, Sir Martin Sorrell claimed that the job of the chief marketing officer has become easier, because there are only four platforms left: Google, Amazon, Meta and TikTok. Has your job become any easier?\n\nOn the contrary, it has become incredibly more complex. If you define the role of a CMO very narrowly as advertising, then you're talking about four platforms. But marketing is so much more than that.\n\nIt starts with insights. Consumer insights, business insights, governmental insights, channel insights. You\u2019ve got a whole bunch of stuff happening based on these insights. A lot of companies work with the four Ps of marketing: Product, price, place, promotion. Into each of these goes a lot of thinking and strategy. I believe narrowing all this down to four platforms is way too simplified. So, I disagree with Sorrell\u2019s conclusion.\n\nYou have a concept (and a book) called Quantum Marketing. Can you give a brief summation of what it\u2019s about?\n\nIf you look at all the theories and principles of marketing, like the four Ps, the purchase funnel or loyalty programmes, the foundational aspects and theories are all 50 to 60 years old. At that time, there was no internet, no mobile, no social, no AI. So, I looked at what fundamental truths of marketing there are, that are immutable and still valid today. I found none.\n\nNone?\n\nLet me give you an example. Consumer insights often come from market surveys, focus group discussions or in-depth interviews. But it has been proven that people\u2019s purchasing decisions are not rational, they are not logical; they are not even conscious. Now, when you ask a consumer why they bought a certain product (or not), they post-rationalise their decision. And that tells you absolutely nothing useful. We need a new way of thinking about consumer insights.\n\nSame with brand loyalty\u2014it\u2019s a myth. A survey in the UK has shown that a stunning 70% of participants have cheated on their spouses and a further 15% would be open to cheating if it were guaranteed that they wouldn\u2019t get caught. If people aren\u2019t even loyal in their personal lives, why would they be loyal in their relationships with brands? If you go and give them an air mile every time they fly with you, that\u2019s not loyalty, that\u2019s consumer stickiness. I believe we need to reinvent every single aspect of marketing. And that reimagined model is quantum marketing.\n\nWhat does that mean for traditional advertising?\n\nAdvertising as we know it is dead. The need for communication is still there, but it\u2019s not happening through advertising any more. Since I joined Mastercard, we have dramatically reduced our advertising budget. We have moved into experiential marketing, which means we curate experiences that money cannot buy, but you can get them with Mastercard. That creates a very different brand pull, preference or love, whatever you like to call it. Other areas like multi-sensory marketing, sonic branding and neuromarketing are also a part of quantum marketing.\n\nSome brands have been dialling back on purpose and the commitment to social good, notably US tech firms. What\u2019s your take on that?\n\nWhen I talk about purpose, one of the most important aspects is earning consumers\u2019 trust. Most people are not impressed when you throw ads at them. They want companies to do something beyond advertising, something that is good for society or the world. And whatever they choose to do, they must do it genuinely. Not just for pretences, political correctness or something to talk about at conferences. It has to be meaningful, consistent and authentic. If you do that, you start earning consumers\u2019 trust.\n\nMastercard is now one of the most-loved brands in the world. It used to be the 87th most-valuable brand, today we\u2019re the 11th. All that happened because we were consistent in our focus. We don\u2019t switch initiatives every few months, we stick with a cause and pull through. If you\u2019re scared of a backlash and change course too often, you will lose consumers\u2019 trust. Consistency and conviction are essential when talking about purpose.\n\nIs it easier for a brand like Mastercard to \u201cdo good\u201d?\n\nNo, it\u2019s just a decision you have to make. Also, you have to find a creative angle. If you present your engagement in an uninteresting and uninspiring fashion, it will fall flat. You have to connect emotionally with consumers and make them believe that you really mean what you\u2019re saying. That's what makes a difference.\n\nWhat do you make of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent turnaround on fact-checking?\n\nWell, he\u2019s making a media decision. It\u2019s too early for us to say what the implications are for us. We\u2019re in the process of evaluating this for our brand, but essentially the Meta platforms are advertising platforms. And Mastercard is about experiences. The bulk of our marketing budget does not go into these platforms. Therefore, we are less affected than other brands.\n\nYour lead creative agency is McCann, an IPG agency. As a client, what are your thoughts on the merger of Omnicom and IPG?\n\nActually, we work with agencies from both companies, like Ketchum from Omnicom. I believe when these two companies go together, they will have a scale advantage. There will be more exchange of competencies. Since we are one of the most prestigious clients of McCann and IPG, I\u2019m sure they will push all the necessary buttons to make sure our business needs are met well. I\u2019m not concerned.\n\nYou\u2019ve been a sponsor of the Uefa Champions League for 30 years and recently announced a partnership with the McLaren Formula One team. How does this kind of old-school sponsorship model fit into the quantum marketing idea of reimagining everything?\n\nThese sponsorships have actually changed a great deal. In the past they used to be a way to showcase our brand. We would put our name on the perimeter board and advertise our sponsorship. Nowadays, it is experience-led. For example, we curate experiences at F1; a limited number of our card members actually get the chance to visit the pit lane. That is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It\u2019s not about advertising any more, it\u2019s about the experience. We offer similar curated experiences in various other fields, like film and music.\n\nThese are real-life experiences. What about immersive tech like AR and VR?\n\nOur Priceless Experiences are predominantly physical. During Covid we pivoted to virtual experiences, like everybody else. However, the kind of experiences we offer are only accessible for a limited number of people. So, we use AR and VR to make their real-life experiences virtually accessible to others. Our clients share it on their social media, get asked how they were able to experience that and voil\u00e0: people are talking about Mastercard.\n\nSpecialist agency Amp has named you the best audio brand for a fifth consecutive year. Why is sonic branding so important?\n\nMost brands have a mnemonic sound, like a jingle or certain songs they always use. We went beyond that. We discovered that there are 10 layers of sound, and we cater to all of them. We use melodies that are adapted to different cultures, we have a sonic signature we use in our ads, we created a special sound that machines make when your Mastercard is accepted, we created music and released an album and so on. Sound has become one of the major dimensions of how our brand is represented.\n\nWhat\u2019s next in AI?\n\nLast year was the year of GenAI. This year will be the year of Agentic AI. A series of specialised agents will each be capable of executing one thing exceptionally well. And these agents will be managed by one super AI agent, which in turn will be monitored by a human. We are already piloting some projects in this direction.\n\nYou have a very holistic approach to marketing. How do you stay on top of new developments? Do you have any advice for marketers struggling with this?\n\nFirst, you must invest time to learn. I spend five hours every weekend learning something new. For example, I actually have my own AI studio at home and play with the technology. It\u2019s the only way to really understand its implications. And then, you also have to make sure your team stays on top of it. We have focused on educating our teams about AI. Also, I reach out to my colleagues and ask them what they are doing in their respective industries. Sometimes you can adapt things from other fields. You do have to take initiative to stay at the cutting edge.\n\nYou wrote a book on quantum marketing. Doesn\u2019t it feel like you\u2019re giving away your secret sauce?\n\nNo, I could share the instructions to build a rocket with you and you still wouldn\u2019t be able to build one. That\u2019s where the power of execution comes in. In the book, I outlined all the audio layers I mentioned a moment ago. And still, not many brands have a strong audio brand. That\u2019s because implementation is very difficult. Also, I feel very committed to this profession. It has given me my bread and butter for over three decades. I want to give something back.\n\nThis story first appeared on Campaign Asia-Pacific.",

And should everyone in the 44 million-strong class \u2013 people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland who purchased goods and services with a Mastercard credit card between June 1997 and June 1998, or from May 1992 in Scotland \u2013 come forward, they will be entitled to claim GBP 2.27 each.\n\n\u201cMEANINGFUL COMPENSATION\u201d\n\nThe settlement does not carry any admission of liability on the part of Mastercard and represents just 2% of the once-mooted GBP 10 billion value of the claim. But while some members of the claimant class might feel deflated at the prospect of such a meagre payout, Mr Merricks does not share in their disappointment. When agreement was reached on 3 December last year, he wrote: \u201cI am very pleased that after nearly nine years of litigation with Mastercard, I have agreed a settlement that I believe will deliver meaningful compensation to class members who choose to come forward to participate in the distribution of the damages. Ever since I began my claim I have aimed to ensure that the new regime for collective redress can be seen to work effectively and to do that I had to take my case to the Supreme Court. I now look forward to presenting the details of the settlement to the Tribunal for its consideration and approval.\u201d\n\nMr Merricks\u2019 statement represents something of a volte face when taken alongside comments made less than a year ago. In February 2024 Boris Bronfentrinker, a litigation partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, the firm representing Mr Merricks, insisted that the GBP 10 billion remained \u201cin play\u201d.\n\nINNSWORTH\n\nHalf of the agreed settlement figure is earmarked for claimants, with a further GBP 45.57 million allocated to litigation funder Innsworth to cover future and already incurred costs. A further GBP 54.43 million could be paid to Innsworth as a return on the funds it provided, depending on the number of people who come forward to claim their slice of the settlement.\n\nWhile Innsworth is perfectly entitled to make a profit on its investments, the disparity between its earnings from the case and each individual class member\u2019s payout after nine years\u2019 worth of legal wrangling, including several hearings, will add fuel to the arguments of those who are yet to enthusiastically embrace the UK\u2019s collective redress regime and who remain unconvinced of the role of litigation funders.\n\nAdding some context, Nikki Stopford, co-founder of consumer rights organisation Consumer Voice, tells ICLG News: \u201cThere are a number of assumptions in the proposed settlement about what each claimant is likely to receive, and it is critical these elements are thoroughly researched with the class. It is important that all distributions use original research to reflect likely take up and how the class will best engage. It will then be for the court to decide if the payout to the litigation funder is fair and proportionate based on all of the information they have available to them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in an email to ICLG News, Seema Kennedy, executive director of Fair Civil Justice, comments: \u201cAfter almost nine years of litigation - including huge costs to the British taxpayer in funding countless hearings - we now know that affected consumers stand to gain just over GBP 2 each in compensation, while the funder could be in line for a GBP 100m payout. \u201d\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d Kennedy continues, \u201cis the economics of a legal system in which lawyers and funders are prioritised over British business and consumers. This claim shows why reform is so badly needed, and we will continue to call on the government to introduce measures to improve transparency and accountability of the funding sector.\u201d\n\nThe past few months have not been the greatest advertisement for class actions in the UK. Last year, the former Conservative government pledged to enact legislation to circumvent PACCAR (the ruling that shed doubt on certain funding arrangements), but failed to do so before the general election. Meanwhile, earlier this month the CAT refused to certify a collective proceedings order against Amazon and Apple in a claim alleging violations of competition law.\n\nWhether these are just bumps in the road or are indicative of more deep-rooted problems remains to be seen.",

            "content": "The payment card giant MasterCard just fixed a glaring error in its domain name server settings that could have allowed anyone to intercept or divert Internet traffic for the company by registering an unused domain name. The misconfiguration persisted for nearly five years until a security researcher spent $300 to register the domain and prevent it from being grabbed by cybercriminals.\n\nFrom June 30, 2020 until January 14, 2025, one of the core Internet servers that MasterCard uses to direct traffic for portions of the mastercard.com network was misnamed. MasterCard.com relies on five shared Domain Name System (DNS) servers at the Internet infrastructure provider Akamai [DNS acts as a kind of Internet phone book, by translating website names to numeric Internet addresses that are easier for computers to manage].\n\nAll of the Akamai DNS server names that MasterCard uses are supposed to end in \u201cakam.net\u201d but one of them was misconfigured to rely on the domain \u201cakam.ne.\u201d\n\nThis tiny but potentially critical typo was discovered recently by Philippe Caturegli, founder of the security consultancy Seralys. Caturegli said he guessed that nobody had yet registered the domain akam.ne, which is under the purview of the top-level domain authority for the West Africa nation of Niger.\n\nCaturegli said it took $300 and nearly three months of waiting to secure the domain with the registry in Niger. After enabling a DNS server on akam.ne, he noticed hundreds of thousands of DNS requests hitting his server each day from locations around the globe. Apparently, MasterCard wasn\u2019t the only organization that had fat-fingered a DNS entry to include \u201cakam.ne,\u201d but they were by far the largest.\n\nHad he enabled an email server on his new domain akam.ne, Caturegli likely would have received wayward emails directed toward mastercard.com or other affected domains. If he\u2019d abused his access, he probably could have obtained website encryption certificates (SSL/TLS certs) that were authorized to accept and relay web traffic for affected websites. He may even have been able to passively receive Microsoft Windows authentication credentials from employee computers at affected companies.\n\nBut the researcher said he didn\u2019t attempt to do any of that. Instead, he alerted MasterCard that the domain was theirs if they wanted it, copying this author on his notifications. A few hours later, MasterCard acknowledged the mistake, but said there was never any real threat to the security of its operations.\n\n\u201cWe have looked into the matter and there was not a risk to our systems,\u201d a MasterCard spokesperson wrote. \u201cThis typo has now been corrected.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Caturegli received a request submitted through Bugcrowd, a program that offers financial rewards and recognition to security researchers who find flaws and work privately with the affected vendor to fix them. The message suggested his public disclosure of the MasterCard DNS error via a post on LinkedIn (after he\u2019d secured the akam.ne domain) was not aligned with ethical security practices, and passed on a request from MasterCard to have the post removed.\n\nCaturegli said while he does have an account on Bugcrowd, he has never submitted anything through the Bugcrowd program, and that he reported this issue directly to MasterCard.\n\n\u201cI did not disclose this issue through Bugcrowd,\u201d Caturegli wrote in reply. \u201cBefore making any public disclosure, I ensured that the affected domain was registered to prevent exploitation, mitigating any risk to MasterCard or its customers. This action, which we took at our own expense, demonstrates our commitment to ethical security practices and responsible disclosure.\u201d\n\nMost organizations have at least two authoritative domain name servers, but some handle so many DNS requests that they need to spread the load over additional DNS server domains. In MasterCard\u2019s case, that number is five, so it stands to reason that if an attacker managed to seize control over just one of those domains they would only be able to see about one-fifth of the overall DNS requests coming in.\n\nBut Caturegli said the reality is that many Internet users are relying at least to some degree on public traffic forwarders or DNS resolvers like Cloudflare and Google.\n\n\u201cSo all we need is for one of these resolvers to query our name server and cache the result,\u201d Caturegli said. By setting their DNS server records with a long TTL or \u201cTime To Live\u201d \u2014 a setting that can adjust the lifespan of data packets on a network \u2014 an attacker\u2019s poisoned instructions for the target domain can be propagated by large cloud providers.\n\n\u201cWith a long TTL, we may reroute a LOT more than just 1/5 of the traffic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe researcher said he\u2019d hoped that the credit card giant might thank him, or at least offer to cover the cost of buying the domain.\n\n\u201cWe obviously disagree with this assessment,\u201d Caturegli wrote in a follow-up post on LinkedIn regarding MasterCard\u2019s public statement. \u201cBut we\u2019ll let you judge\u2014 here are some of the DNS lookups we recorded before reporting the issue.\u201d\n\nAs the screenshot above shows, the misconfigured DNS server Caturegli found involved the MasterCard subdomain az.mastercard.com. It is not clear exactly how this subdomain is used by MasterCard, however their naming conventions suggest the domains correspond to production servers at Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud service. Caturegli said the domains all resolve to Internet addresses at Microsoft.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like Mastercard,\u201d Caturegli concluded in his LinkedIn post. \u201cDon\u2019t dismiss risk, and don\u2019t let your marketing team handle security disclosures.\u201d\n\nOne final note: The domain akam.ne has been registered previously \u2014 in December 2016 by someone using the email address um-i-delo@yandex.ru. The Russian search giant Yandex reports this user account belongs to an \u201cIvan I.\u201d from Moscow. Passive DNS records from DomainTools.com show that between 2016 and 2018 the domain was connected to an Internet server in Germany, and that the domain was left to expire in 2018.\n\nThis is interesting given a comment on Caturegli\u2019s LinkedIn post from an ex-Cloudflare employee who linked to a report he co-authored on a similar typo domain apparently registered in 2017 for organizations that may have mistyped their AWS DNS server as \u201cawsdns-06.ne\u201d instead of \u201cawsdns-06.net.\u201d DomainTools reports that this typo domain also was registered to a Yandex user (playlotto@yandex.ru), and was hosted at the same German ISP \u2014 Team Internet (AS61969).",

The key features and benefits explained. How do credit cards work and how can you use them wisely? The features and benefits explained. Just Curious\n\nAre you a Visa or Mastercard holder who was charged an access fee at an ATM in the past 17 years? If so, you may be owed a part of a $197.5 million class action settlement \u2014 but you need to act fast.\n\nThe deadline to submit a claim to get money back in your pocket is today, Jan. 22.\n\nThe settlement concludes a decades-long lawsuit that accused two of the world's largest credit card service corporations of inflating surcharges at certain bank-operated ATMS between Oct. 1, 2007 and July 26, 2024.\n\nThe lawsuit stems from a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. by two customers who claimed that additional ATM fees imposed by banks associated with Visa and Mastercard networks were not clearly disclosed, court records show. The fees, called \"surcharges,\" occur when customers use ATMS outside of their bank's network.\n\nCourt records filed in the case show that between 175 and 215 million customers may have been affected, with Visa agreeing to pay $104.7 million and Mastercard forking over the remaining $92.8 million to settle. The defendants did not have to admit guilt; rather, they denied the allegations and a judge declined to lay blame on any party.\n\n\"The parties\u2019 negotiations were hard-fought via protracted negotiations that occurred at multiple mediations over several years,\" the settlement states.\n\nJP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America were among the banks involved, according to a website created by the court-appointed claims administrator, who was required to post notice of the settlement online and on other media, including through digital ads and in \"People\" magazine for those that don't frequent social or digital media. Those banks agreed to a prior settlement of $67 million.\n\nBetween the bank and credit card settlements, the companies will be paying $264.24 million to customers, the settlement states.\n\nHow do I file a claim to get money from Visa or Mastercard?\n\nIf you already filed a claim or received a payment from a previous settlement with the banks named, you will be automatically eligible to get payment from Visa and Mastercard, according to the claims website. If you believe you paid fees at an ATM that were not reimbursed after you filed that initial claim, you will need to submit another claim.\n\nFor those who have not yet filed a claim, you must submit one to receive payment by Jan. 22. While customers can print a form and mail it, since the deadline is imminent, it is best to fill out the quick online form here.\n\nAs with any bank settlements, the amount of money each customer will receive will depend on the number of claims submitted, according to the settlement agreement. Customers will likely be reimbursed via digital payment options, such as PayPal or virtual debit card, but can also have the option to request a paper check.\n\nAdditional information on the lawsuit, other related lawsuits, payments and offering comments related to the decision can be found in the long-form notice on the website.

But since this card doesn\u2019t offer elevated rewards on any other purchases and you can only redeem your rewards at Westgate, most people \u2014 even some timeshare owners \u2014 will likely fare better with a general travel credit card.\n\nBut if you\u2019re a Westgate loyalist who wants a simple way to earn rewards on your vacation, the card\u2019s straightforward rewards and convenient redemption might be a good option for you.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the World of Westgate Mastercard.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The company previously offered a different credit card, Westgate Rewards Mastercard, which was issued by Comenity Bank but discontinued in 2021.\n\n1. Applying won't automatically impact your credit scores\n\nWhen you apply for the World of Westgate Mastercard, Imprint won't automatically do a hard credit pull. You'll be able to see if you're approved first and what your credit limit would be. The company will perform a hard credit pull only if you decide to accept the offer. If you're on the fence about applying (or are unsure if you will be approved), this perk can help you make your decision without impacting your credit scores.\n\nTravel Rewards Expert Reveals... Why this is her top credit card for dining rewards, and she shows you exactly how she realizes more than $1,000 in value from it each year. Click for details\n\n2. You\u2019ll earn a small sign-up bonus\n\nOnce you\u2019re approved and make three purchases in the first 180 days, you\u2019ll receive 50,000 points, which can be redeemed for $50 back on future purchases at Westgate. This is significantly lower than sign-up bonuses on other no-annual-fee cards, but it\u2019s rare for a credit card to offer a bonus without requiring you to spend a specific amount of money first.\n\nSimilar hotel cards might require you to spend anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 before you can get a bonus. With the World of Westgate Mastercard, any three purchases \u2014 no matter how small \u2014 will qualify you for the bonus.\n\n3. Earnings are underwhelming\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nPurchases with Westgate earn 3% back \u2014 including on-property purchases and timeshare mortgage payments. The ability to pay your timeshare mortgage on a credit card is unique.\n\nEven though this is a solid rate, the World of Westgate Mastercard doesn\u2019t make a good standalone card because you won\u2019t earn elevated rewards on any purchase outside the hotel chain. All other purchases earn 1% back.\n\nIf you prefer to keep only one card in your wallet, the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card could be a good alternative. Cardholders earn 2% back on purchases. Sure, you\u2019d earn slightly less on Westgate purchases, but the higher rate on purchases outside of the hotel will easily make up the difference.\n\nWestgate loyalists could also carry both credit cards and use the World of Westgate Mastercard with the hotel brand and the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card on everything else.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip You'll earn rewards in the form of points, and 10 points are worth 1 cent. So for every dollar you spend at Westgate, you'll earn 30 points, which equals 3 cents.\n\n4. You can only redeem rewards at Westgate\n\nThe rewards you earn on the World of Westgate Mastercard can only be redeemed for Westgate purchases. But you don\u2019t have to redeem your rewards for reservations. You can also redeem for timeshare mortgages, restaurants on site and on-property activities.\n\nSince you can redeem your rewards on many Westgate purchases, it probably won\u2019t be too hard for timeshare holders and frequent Westgate visitors to redeem rewards. But other cards will offer you more flexibility. With the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card, rewards are much more flexible. You can redeem your rewards for a statement credit, a mailed check, direct deposit into a Wells Fargo checking or savings account or a withdrawal at a Wells Fargo ATM (in increments of $20).\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Westgate does have loyalty status levels, but higher tiers are reserved for timeshare owners. Anyone can join the Member Tier, which gives you up to 10% off direct bookings, complimentary Wi-Fi and discounts on certain fees.\n\n5. The card doesn\u2019t come with many perks\n\nMany hotel cards \u2014 even some with no annual fee \u2014 come with valuable extras like elite status, free nights and annual spending bonuses. The World of Westgate Mastercard is missing all of these perks. If you\u2019re already a timeshare owner or otherwise loyal to the hotel brand, this isn\u2019t necessarily a dealbreaker. But if you\u2019re not partial to Westgate, you will probably get more value out of a different hotel card.",

It forms part of a new \u2018Tap to More\u2019 service suite that also includes:\n\nTap to Add\u200b, for provisioning a card to a mobile wallet or merchant app\n\nTap to Activate, which eliminates the need for the cardholder to call their bank or visit an ATM to activate a new or reissued card\n\nTap to Verify, which provides confirmation that the cardholder has possession of their physical card when making an online purchase using their mobile wallet, bank app or a merchant app\n\nTap to Send or Receive, for peer-to-peer contactless transactions\n\nTap on Phone, Mastercard\u2019s softPOS service that enables merchants to accept contactless payments on standard smartphones.\n\n\u201cAs the physical and digital experiences continue to converge, we\u2019re taking the tap beyond physical checkout,\u201d Marriner says.\n\n\u201cWith our Tap to More set of contactless modalities, we can make digital commerce even faster, safer and simpler, from instantly provisioning a card into a mobile wallet to verifying a transaction to sending money to friends and family, all with just a tap.\u201d\n\nOpenRice is using the new Tap on Own Device offering to provide its restaurant customers with the ability to offer diners a card-present self-checkout solution.\n\n\u201cMastercard cardholders paying via OpenRice App can enjoy the same robust and multi-layered security protections that come with paying via the existing Mastercard payment solution,\u201d Mastercard Hong Kong explains.\n\n\u201cThe OpenRice mobile app currently allows cardholders to pay via Mastercard and other payment cards linked to their OpenRice accounts or digital wallets. Supported by the card-on-file solution, the payment process can be activated through scanning a payment QR code initiated by restaurants.\u201d\n\nWith the new service, \u201cupon scanning the QR codes presented in partnered restaurants with OpenRice Pay in the enhanced OpenRice mobile app, cardholders will also be able to pay for their restaurant bills all on their own by tapping their physical contactless Mastercard cards against their own Android devices.\u201d\n\nNext: Visit the NFCW Expo to find new suppliers and solutions",

            "content": "If you look at all the theories and principles of marketing, like the four Ps, the purchase funnel or loyalty programmes, the foundational aspects and theories are all 50 to 60 years old. At that time, there was no internet, no mobile, no social, no AI. So, I looked at what fundamental truths of marketing there are, that are immutable and still valid today. I found none.\n\nNone?\n\nLet me give you an example. Consumer insights often come from market surveys, focus group discussions or in-depth interviews. But it has been proven that people\u2019s purchasing decisions are not rational, they are not logical; they are not even conscious. Now, when you ask a consumer why they bought a certain product (or not), they post-rationalise their decision. And that tells you absolutely nothing useful. We need a new way of thinking about consumer insights.\n\nSame with brand loyalty\u2014it\u2019s a myth. A survey in the UK has shown that a stunning 70% of participants have cheated on their spouses and a further 15% would be open to cheating if it were guaranteed that they wouldn\u2019t get caught. If people aren\u2019t even loyal in their personal lives, why would they be loyal in their relationships with brands? If you go and give them an air mile every time they fly with you, that\u2019s not loyalty, that\u2019s consumer stickiness. I believe we need to reinvent every single aspect of marketing. And that reimagined model is quantum marketing.\n\nWhat does that mean for traditional advertising?\n\nAdvertising as we know it is dead. The need for communication is still there, but it\u2019s not happening through advertising any more. Since I joined Mastercard, we have dramatically reduced our advertising budget. We have moved into experiential marketing, which means we curate experiences that money cannot buy, but you can get them with Mastercard. That creates a very different brand pull, preference or love, whatever you like to call it. Other areas like multi-sensory marketing, sonic branding and neuromarketing are also a part of quantum marketing.\n\nSome brands have been dialling back on purpose and the commitment to social good, notably US tech firms. What\u2019s your take on that?\n\nWhen I talk about purpose, one of the most important aspects is earning consumers\u2019 trust. Most people are not impressed when you throw ads at them. They want companies to do something beyond advertising, something that is good for society or the world. And whatever they choose to do, they must do it genuinely. Not just for pretences, political correctness or something to talk about at conferences. It has to be meaningful, consistent and authentic. If you do that, you start earning consumers\u2019 trust.\n\nMastercard is now one of the most-loved brands in the world. It used to be the 87th most-valuable brand, today we\u2019re the 11th. All that happened because we were consistent in our focus. We don\u2019t switch initiatives every few months, we stick with a cause and pull through. If you\u2019re scared of a backlash and change course too often, you will lose consumers\u2019 trust. Consistency and conviction are essential when talking about purpose.\n\nIs it easier for a brand like Mastercard to \u201cdo good\u201d?\n\nNo, it\u2019s just a decision you have to make. Also, you have to find a creative angle. If you present your engagement in an uninteresting and uninspiring fashion, it will fall flat. You have to connect emotionally with consumers and make them believe that you really mean what you\u2019re saying. That's what makes a difference.\n\nWhat do you make of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent turnaround on fact-checking?\n\nWell, he\u2019s making a media decision. It\u2019s too early for us to say what the implications are for us. We\u2019re in the process of evaluating this for our brand, but essentially the Meta platforms are advertising platforms. And Mastercard is about experiences. The bulk of our marketing budget does not go into these platforms. Therefore, we are less affected than other brands.\n\nYour lead creative agency is McCann, an IPG agency. As a client, what are your thoughts on the merger of Omnicom and IPG?\n\nActually, we work with agencies from both companies, like Ketchum from Omnicom. I believe when these two companies go together, they will have a scale advantage. There will be more exchange of competencies. Since we are one of the most prestigious clients of McCann and IPG, I\u2019m sure they will push all the necessary buttons to make sure our business needs are met well. I\u2019m not concerned.\n\nYou\u2019ve been a sponsor of the Uefa Champions League for 30 years and recently announced a partnership with the McLaren Formula One team. How does this kind of old-school sponsorship model fit into the quantum marketing idea of reimagining everything?\n\nThese sponsorships have actually changed a great deal. In the past they used to be a way to showcase our brand. We would put our name on the perimeter board and advertise our sponsorship. Nowadays, it is experience-led. For example, we curate experiences at F1; a limited number of our card members actually get the chance to visit the pit lane. That is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It\u2019s not about advertising any more, it\u2019s about the experience. We offer similar curated experiences in various other fields, like film and music.\n\nThese are real-life experiences. What about immersive tech like AR and VR?\n\nOur Priceless Experiences are predominantly physical. During Covid we pivoted to virtual experiences, like everybody else. However, the kind of experiences we offer are only accessible for a limited number of people. So, we use AR and VR to make their real-life experiences virtually accessible to others. Our clients share it on their social media, get asked how they were able to experience that and voil\u00e0: people are talking about Mastercard.\n\nSpecialist agency Amp has named you the best audio brand for a fifth consecutive year. Why is sonic branding so important?\n\nMost brands have a mnemonic sound, like a jingle or certain songs they always use. We went beyond that. We discovered that there are 10 layers of sound, and we cater to all of them. We use melodies that are adapted to different cultures, we have a sonic signature we use in our ads, we created a special sound that machines make when your Mastercard is accepted, we created music and released an album and so on. Sound has become one of the major dimensions of how our brand is represented.\n\nWhat\u2019s next in AI?\n\nLast year was the year of GenAI. This year will be the year of Agentic AI. A series of specialised agents will each be capable of executing one thing exceptionally well. And these agents will be managed by one super AI agent, which in turn will be monitored by a human. We are already piloting some projects in this direction.\n\nYou have a very holistic approach to marketing. How do you stay on top of new developments? Do you have any advice for marketers struggling with this?\n\nFirst, you must invest time to learn. I spend five hours every weekend learning something new. For example, I actually have my own AI studio at home and play with the technology. It\u2019s the only way to really understand its implications. And then, you also have to make sure your team stays on top of it. We have focused on educating our teams about AI. Also, I reach out to my colleagues and ask them what they are doing in their respective industries. Sometimes you can adapt things from other fields. You do have to take initiative to stay at the cutting edge.\n\nYou wrote a book on quantum marketing. Doesn\u2019t it feel like you\u2019re giving away your secret sauce?\n\nNo, I could share the instructions to build a rocket with you and you still wouldn\u2019t be able to build one. That\u2019s where the power of execution comes in. In the book, I outlined all the audio layers I mentioned a moment ago. And still, not many brands have a strong audio brand. That\u2019s because implementation is very difficult. Also, I feel very committed to this profession. It has given me my bread and butter for over three decades. I want to give something back.",

            "content": "The Oregon-based credit union First Tech has a small suite of credit cards that includes the Choice Rewards World Mastercard, which boasts a $0 annual fee, $0 balance transfer fee and a lower-than-average APR. However, because a credit union issues the Choice Rewards card, potential cardholders must meet specific eligibility requirements to get the Choice Rewards card.\n\nIf you already belong to the First Tech credit union, getting the Choice Rewards card feels like an easy, sensible choice. Everyone else will need to decide if the effort required to join the credit union is worth the benefits of the Choice Rewards card.\n\nHere are five things to know about the First Tech Choice Rewards World Mastercard.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Though the names sound similar, don't confuse this card with the Choice Privileges\u00ae Mastercard\u00ae, which is affiliated with Choice Hotels and earns hotel redemption points.\n\n1. Membership is required\n\nOnly First Tech Credit Union members are eligible to apply for the Choice Rewards credit card. Nevertheless, there are many points of entry into this credit union. You can become a member if:\n\nA family or household member is already a First Tech member.\n\nYou or a family member work for one of First Tech's partners. The list is quite extensive and represents a range of industries.\n\nYou work for the state of Oregon.\n\nYou work or live in Lane County, Oregon.\n\nYou belong to California's Computer History Museum, which costs as little as $15 a year.\n\nYou belong to the Financial Fitness Association. Membership costs $8 a year.\n\nThe ability to gain First Tech membership by joining the Financial Fitness Association will be especially useful for those who live outside of Oregon, where the First Tech Credit Union is headquartered. Credit union members must typically live or work near one of the union's branches. Still, by joining the Financial Fitness Association, you can bypass that requirement for a few bucks a year.\n\n2. It's light on fees\n\nOne of the highlights of the Choice Rewards card is the absence of fees common in other credit cards. In addition to its $0 annual fee, the card also does away with:\n\nThe Choice Rewards card does charge up to a $25 fee for late and returned payments, but other cards usually charge as much as $40.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip When you open a First Tech Rewards Checking account, you'll get a $10 streaming subscription rebate and an extra 0.5% cash back on monthly credit card spending. Earnings from the additional 0.5% are capped at $15.\n\n3. Its APR is lower than average\n\nTypical of credit cards from credit unions, the annual percentage rate (APR) for purchases on the Choice Rewards card is significantly lower than the industry average. As of December 2023, the purchase APR on the Choice Rewards card tops out at 18%. Meanwhile, the average APR in August 2023 on all interest-accruing credit cards was 22.77%, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nIdeally, you\u2019re paying off credit card balances in full to avoid interest charges and higher utilization rates, which can lower your credit score. But a card like the Choice Rewards can be a money-saver when it\u2019s not possible to do so.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The Choice Rewards credit card has a minimum credit limit of $10,000 and a maximum of $35,000.\n\n4. It earns double points in popular spending categories\n\nThe Choice Rewards card earns 2 points per $1 spent on several everyday categories:\n\nGas.\n\nDining.\n\nElectronics.\n\nGrocery stores.\n\nHousehold goods.\n\nMedical expenses.\n\nTelecommunications.\n\nAll other spending earns 1 point per $1 spent. There's no cap on the points you can earn, and points never expire.\n\nPoints are worth 1 cent each when redeemed for cash, so 1,000 points equal $10 in cash back. In addition to cash back, rewards points may be redeemed for travel, merchandise, gift cards and experiences. Minimum redemption amounts vary depending on the redemption type; cardholders must have at least 2,500 points to redeem for cash.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The Choice Rewards Mastercard has a robust list of categories that qualify for bonus points, but read the fine print so you're familiar with what earns double points and what doesn't. For example, food delivery services won't count as dining and warehouse clubs like Costco aren't classified as grocery stores.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.88% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 1.24%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.65%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the processor of debit and credit card payments had lost 0.81% in the past month. In that same time, the Business Services sector gained 0.03%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.17%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of MasterCard in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on January 30, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $3.69, reflecting a 16.04% increase from the same quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $7.38 billion, indicating a 12.75% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for MasterCard. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.31% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. At present, MasterCard boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, MasterCard is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 32.34. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 14.27, so one might conclude that MasterCard is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nWe can additionally observe that MA currently boasts a PEG ratio of 2.09. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Financial Transaction Services industry stood at 1.18 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 85, finds itself in the top 34% echelons of all 250+ industries.",

The company markets three premium cards with hefty annual fees, touting their metal construction and fancy perks:\n\nLuxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Titanium Card\u2122, $195 annual fee.\n\nLuxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Black Card\u2122, $495 annual fee.\n\nLuxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Gold Card\u2122, $995 annual fee.\n\nBut the value of these cards is relatively lackluster when you take the high annual fees into account.

The cards are pricey\n\nIssued by Barclays, the cards in the Luxury Card portfolio have annual fees in the triple digits. The Mastercard Gold Card is the priciest, with a fee just south of $1,000 a year, while the Mastercard Titanium Card is the least expensive. In the middle is the Mastercard Black Card, which launched in 2016 as a rebranded version of the old Visa Black.\n\nThe cards can get even more costly if you want to add another person to the account. For each authorized user, you\u2019ll pay:\n\n$95 on the Luxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Titanium Card\u2122.\n\n$195 on the Luxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Black Card\u2122.\n\n$295 on the Luxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Gold Card\u2122.\n\nA high annual fee on a credit card isn\u2019t necessarily a deal-breaker if you can get more value out of the card in rewards and benefits. But with these cards, that can be hard to do.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The Luxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Black Card\u2122 is not the same product as The Centurion Card from American Express, which is also commonly referred to as the Black Card.\n\nSOME CARD INFO MAY BE OUTDATED All information about The Centurion\u00ae Card from American Express and the Business Centurion\u00ae Card from American Express has been collected independently by NerdWallet. The Centurion\u00ae Card from American Express and the Business Centurion\u00ae Card from American Express are no longer available through NerdWallet.\n\n2. The rewards are just OK\n\nThe Luxury Card website says cardmembers \u201creceive leading airfare and cash back redemption rates.\u201d But dig a little deeper and the rewards aren't actually better than the competition.\n\nHere\u2019s how much they're worth:\n\nLuxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Titanium Card\u2122: Points are worth 2 cents apiece for airfare redemptions and 1 cent apiece for other redemptions.\n\nLuxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Black Card\u2122. Points are worth 2 cents apiece for airfare redemptions, 1.5 cents apiece for cash back and 1 cent apiece for other redemptions.\n\nLuxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Gold Card\u2122: Points are worth 2 cents apiece for both airfare redemptions and cash back and 1 cent apiece for other redemptions.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nSure, the points on these cards can be worth up to 2 cents apiece, which is double the standard 1 cent per point offered on many cards. But you'll only earn 1 point per dollar spent. Assuming you redeem all your rewards for 2 cents per point, this is essentially the same earnings rate as Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card. Each mile is worth 1 cent, but you'll earn 2 miles per dollar on most purchases.\n\nEven though the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card has an annual fee of $395, you have the potential to eke even more value out of your points by transferring them to a travel loyalty program. This card and its chief competitors the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae (annual fee: $550) and The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express (annual fee: $695) have multiple airline and hotel partners that allow you to transfer your points to loyalty programs at a 1-to-1 rate (Terms apply). If you transferred points on one of these cards to a partner to take advantage of a high-value redemption, you might be able to get, say, 5 cents of value out of each point.\n\nThe cards in the Luxury Card collection don\u2019t have transfer partners; the maximum value you can get out of each point is 2 cents.\n\n3. They're made of heavy metal\n\nThe cards from the Luxury Card collection are mostly unspectacular, but they do stand out in one way: They all have attractive metal designs. Luxury Card notes that it has 83 patents issued globally for its metal card constructions that \"outweigh the competition.\" The Luxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Gold Card\u2122 \u2014 the one with a $995 annual fee \u2014 is even plated in 24-karat gold.\n\n4. Some of the perks are fancy\n\nAs is usually the case with premium cards, the offerings in the Luxury Card collection come with some swanky perks. Here are some of the most valuable:\n\nAnnual airline credit. The Luxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Gold Card\u2122 offers $200 in annual air travel credit toward qualifying purchases. The Luxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Black Card\u2122 offers $100 a year in such credit.\n\nCredit for Global Entry or TSA Precheck application fee. These programs can get you through airport security and customs faster. The credit is available on the Black and Gold cards, but not on the Titanium.\n\nPriority Pass Select membership. This perk, which gets you into airport lounges around the world, is available on the Black and Gold cards, but not on the Titanium.\n\nConcierge. All three cards offer 24/7 access to the Luxury Card Concierge. This service assists with such tasks as recovering items left behind at a hotel, planning a special event or arranging a last-minute delivery.\n\n5. Overall, the cards are so-so\n\nThe cards in the Luxury Card portfolio are decent, but for the cost, you can do better.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nConsider this: In the Luxury Card family, only one card \u2014 the Luxury Card\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae Gold Card\u2122, which has an annual fee of $995 \u2014 offers $200 in airline credits, a Global Entry or TSA Precheck application credit and Priority Pass Select membership benefits. Meanwhile, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae and The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express offer similar benefits and more at a fraction of the price.\n\nTo be clear, the cards in the Luxury Card portfolio aren\u2019t terrible. As showy premium cards, they\u2019re OK. But if you\u2019re spending a fortune on an annual fee, you might want more than that.

Despite initial gains, the Trump token\u2019s price dropped sharply, falling more than 40% in the last 24 hours.\n\nSingapore-based cryptocurrency platform Oobit further expanded the token\u2019s utility, allowing EU users to make everyday purchases\u2014such as buying meals at McDonald\u2019s\u2014using $TRUMP tokens through a tap-and-pay feature.\n\nOobit allows cryptocurrency holders to \u201cTap & Pay\u201d at over 100 million retailers worldwide, leveraging existing Visa and Mastercard networks in a manner similar to Apple Pay.\n\nDespite the memecoin\u2019s success and Trump\u2019s previous pro-crypto campaign promises, digital assets were absent from the administration\u2019s official \u201cAmerica First Priorities\u201d. Instead, the president\u2019s agenda focused on public safety, energy independence, government reform, and traditional American values.\n\nSpeculation over Trump issuing an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve also went unfulfilled on January 20. However, market analysts remain optimistic that crypto-related initiatives will emerge during his second term. Bettors on Polymarket, a decentralized prediction platform, still estimate a one-in-three chance that a Bitcoin reserve could be announced within Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office.\n\nCalifornia Representative Maxine Waters, ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, raised concerns about the impact of Trump\u2019s memecoin. In a statement, Waters described the token as the \u201cworst of crypto\u201d and warned that it could compromise the industry\u2019s credibility.\n\nWaters alleged that the memecoin lacked transparency, prevented investors from filing class-action lawsuits, and created opportunities for money transfers without adequate oversight. She suggested that these factors could enable circumvention of anti-corruption and national security laws. The congresswoman also predicted that investors would bear the losses once insiders cashed out, referring to the potential for a \u201crug pull.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough his memecoin, Trump has created a way to circumvent national security and anti-corruption laws,\u201d said Waters.",

            "content": "The following is a sponsored post by AXS. The opinions are those of The MileLion.\n\nAXS has launched a new feature that allows customers to make recurring bill payments with Mastercard credit and debit cards.\n\nThis is conceptually similar to setting up a GIRO billing arrangement, only backed by a credit card instead of bank account. Not only do you get the certainty of on-time payment, it also lets you stretch your cashflow by tapping your credit card\u2019s interest-free period of up to 55 days.\n\nUnlike paper-based GIRO arrangements, recurring bill payments via AXS and Mastercard can be set up instantly, without any processing time. They also offer a greater degree of control compared to a traditional GIRO arrangement, with the option to pause or skip a given month\u2019s payment if you wish.\n\nAXS now offers recurring bill payments with Mastercard\n\nAXS customers can now set up recurring bill payments for the following categories with a Mastercard credit or debit card.\n\nCategory Remarks General\n\nE xcluding HDB, IRAS, DHL Express, Lion City rentals, SPH Media Limited, UPS Services Credit Cards Can only use debit card to pay Loans Can only use debit card to pay\n\nExcluding Crawfort, Credit21, HDB, Standard Chartered Services Insurance Excluding Etiqa Insurance, Great Eastern Life, HL Assurance, Income Insurance Limited, Singapore Life Ltd. Services Storage Memberships Excluding NTUC Union Membership, SAFRA, The Institution of Engineers, Singapore Services Electricity Home Services Student Services\n\nTo set up a recurring payment, first pay a bill using a Mastercard credit or debit card (Payment Mode Selection> Credit/Debit Cards > Other Banks > Enter your Mastercard number).\n\nAfter completing a payment for an eligible bill, you\u2019ll be prompted to set up a recurring billing arrangement. Once done, future bill payments will be automatically charged to the same Mastercard.\n\nAs an added incentive for setting up recurring payments, customers who complete the setup process with a Mastercard will receive a S$2 AXS e-Voucher. This promotion is valid from now till 31 March 2025 or until 10,000 vouchers are fully redeemed, whichever happens first.\n\nThe T&Cs of this campaign can be found here.\n\nWhat are the advantages?\n\nFaster payment setup\n\nWhile e-GIRO is gradually being rolled out in Singapore, not all billing organisations support it yet. In that case, you\u2019ll need to fill out a physical form and mail it in, with processing times taking up to four weeks.\n\nAny recurring bill arrangement set up with AXS and Mastercard comes into effect immediately.\n\nCertainty of on-time payment\n\nSimilar to a GIRO arrangement, setting up a recurring bill arrangement with AXS and Mastercard ensures on-time payment every month. This lets you avoid late fees and finance charges, or the accidental lapse of your insurance policy.\n\nMore control over payments\n\nThere may be situations where you\u2019d like to initiate a temporary pause on a recurring payment arrangement, perhaps because of a dispute, or if you\u2019ve made a manual payment through another channel and want to avoid a double deduction.\n\nUnder a traditional GIRO billing arrangement, the only way of stopping a payment is to terminate the arrangement completely. This might be too drastic a measure to take, especially if your intention is only to skip a single payment.\n\nThe AXS m-Station app (Android | iOS) offers more control, with users able to manage their recurring billing arrangements from a centralised dashboard. To see this, visit the Account section, then choose Recurring Payment. This will show a complete list of recurring bills under your Mastercard.\n\nThe m-Station app will also notify you three days in advance of every recurring deduction, and if you wish, you can stop the recurring payment anytime up till 3 p.m on the day before the recurring payment date. Users have the option to pause payments for one cycle, or disable them indefinitely.\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 Other AXS m-Station app features The AXS app also allows you to save frequently used billers under My Favourites, which avoids the need to enter the details each time. Other useful features include My Vault, a secure feature for storing payment details or important receipts/documents for easy access (e.g. insurance policies).\n\nStretch cashflow by tapping your credit card\u2019s interest-free period\n\nTo be clear: you won\u2019t earn any credit card rewards for paying bills via AXS, because AXS transactions fall under the rewards exclusion list for most card issuers in Singapore.\n\nHowever, most of the bills that AXS processes either can\u2019t be paid with credit cards directly, or aren\u2019t eligible to earn credit card rewards. If you wanted to get around these restrictions, you\u2019d typically need to pay an admin fee through a platform like Pay+Earn, CardUp or Citi PayAll.\n\nSo what\u2019s the appeal here? Cashflow.\n\nPaying your AXS bills via Mastercard allows you to take advantage of the interest-free period on your credit card, delaying the outflow of funds from your account.\n\nSuppose you have an insurance premium to pay, and your options are:\n\nOption 1: Pay the bill on AXS via eNETS or PayNow QR\n\nPay the bill on AXS via eNETS or PayNow QR Option 2: Pay the bill on AXS via Mastercard credit card\n\nIf you pick option 1, funds are deducted immediately from your account and used to pay the insurance premium.\n\nIf you pick option 2, your credit card is charged and the insurance premium is paid immediately. But your credit card bill isn\u2019t due straight away.\n\nFor example, suppose your statement date falls on the 10th of each month, and you have a bill that\u2019s due on 12 January 2025. You can make the payment via AXS with your Mastercard credit card on 11 January 2025, which will become part of the statement balance that arrives on 10 February 2025.\n\nAssuming your bank gives you 25 days to pay, cash only leaves your account on 7 March 2025. You have effectively enjoyed an interest-free period of 55 days!\n\nSo the general idea here is to make your payments at the very start of your credit card statement period, giving you additional time to pay at no additional cost (remember, you can call up the bank and ask them to switch your statement cycle to better suit the timing of your regular bills).\n\nOf course, the timelines may not always line up so neatly, because you can\u2019t dictate when certain bills need to be paid. But the general idea of stretching your cashflow by using the credit card\u2019s interest-free period still holds.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Stack with HSBC Everyday Global Account (EGA) The HSBC EGA offers customers 1% cashback for GIRO bill payments, capped at S$300 per month for Personal Banking, and S$500 per month for Premier/Jade customers. Instead of making GIRO bill payments directly with a HSBC EGA, what you could do is put these charges on your non-HSBC Mastercard via AXS, then set up a GIRO arrangement with the HSBC EGA for that card. Each month, your bills will be charged to the Mastercard. When the card balance gets paid, you\u2019ll earn 1% cashback. In other words, you get to stack the interest-free benefit with EGA cashback.\n\nConclusion\n\nAXS customers can now set up recurring bill payments with their Mastercard credit or debit card. While you won\u2019t earn rewards for AXS transactions, doing so gives you greater control over your payments, and the ability to leverage your credit card\u2019s interest-free period, even for bills where credit cards are normally not accepted.\n\nMore payment options for recurring payments will be added progressively, so stay tuned.",

            "content": "\u00bb The Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae is no longer available. In May 2024, Capital One and Walmart announced they were ending their partnership, and later that summer, Capital One closed applications for both the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae and the closed-loop, store-only Walmart Rewards Card. Existing cardholders were to be transitioned to the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card.\n\nWalmart sells virtually every household item you could ever need, from groceries, electronics and cosmetics to party supplies, auto parts and even gas in some cases. The Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae aims to reward you more for those purchases, especially if you skip the maze of aisles in favor of shopping online.\n\nThe $0-annual-fee card \u2014 which has replaced the previous Walmart co-branded card issued by Synchrony Bank \u2014 earns:\n\n5% back on Walmart.com and Walmart app purchases, including grocery pickup and delivery.\n\n5% back on in-store purchases using Walmart Pay for the first 12 months (2% after that).\n\n2% back on in-store purchases (after the introductory 5% back period ends). This includes purchases at Walmart fuel stations.\n\n2% back on restaurants and travel.\n\n1% back everywhere else.\n\nThose are impressive rates for a store-branded card. But is it right for you? Here's how to figure that out.\n\nWhy you might want the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae\n\n1. You turn to Walmart for most household items\n\nStore cards are the most rewarding when much of your budget is dedicated to that particular retailer. If Walmart is your source for both regular purchases (food, clothing, toiletries) and bigger buys (televisions, patio furniture, above-ground swimming pools), the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae becomes a more compelling option. When it comes to rewards cards, earning more points where you spend the most is the sweet spot.\n\n2. You\u2019ve embraced technology\n\nShoppers who crave convenience and instant gratification will benefit from earning the highest rewards rate, which is reserved for Walmart.com and Walmart app purchases. That 5% rate extends to items you buy online and then pick up in store. You can also earn 5% back on Walmart Grocery Pickup and Delivery, a timesaver for anyone who dreads a trip to the grocery store.\n\nThe card\u2019s digital focus begins before you make your first purchase. You can apply for the card online at Walmart.com or CapitalOne.com, but there's also a mobile application; you can text to apply and then go through the application process from your phone. Walmart app users (including anyone who downloads the app once they get the Walmart card) can begin using their new card once their application is approved, even before the physical card arrives in the mail.\n\nWhile the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae lacks a traditional sign-up bonus for new cardholders, it offers Earn 5% back on purchases in Walmart stores when you use this card in Walmart Pay for the first 12 months after approval. Walmart Pay is a digital wallet you can access through the Walmart app that allows you to make purchases with your phone at in-store registers.\n\n3. You seek flexibility when redeeming rewards\n\nThe Synchrony version of the Walmart card automatically converted your earnings into a monthly statement credit, but the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae gives you a pretty wide range of redemption options, much like the variety of the items Walmart sells. Redeem your points for:\n\nStatement credits.\n\nGift cards.\n\nTo cover a purchase.\n\nTravel.\n\nDuring checkout at Walmart.com.\n\n4. You want no annual fee\n\nAnother popular retail card, Amazon's Prime Visa, technically has a $0 annual fee. But you can get that card and its coveted 5% back at Amazon.com and Whole Foods only if you have an eligible Prime membership, which costs $139 a year ($69 a year for students). It\u2019s like you\u2019re paying an annual fee, in a way. That membership fee may well be worth it given the goodies you get from Amazon, but keep in mind that there is no membership requirement to get the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Amazon Prime members get free shipping on Prime-eligible items regardless of price, but that's a benefit of Prime membership and not from the Prime Visa itself. The Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae doesn't offer a free-shipping benefit either, but you'll get it via Walmart.com if you spend at least $35.\n\nWhy you might pass on the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae\n\n1. You\u2019re loyal to a different 'everything store'\n\nInertia is strong, and if you habitually turn to other retailers and are happy with them, the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae may not motivate you enough to change how you shop. That\u2019s especially true if you live closer to a Target or routinely make small Amazon purchases below that $35 free shipping threshold set by Walmart.com. The ideal retail card is one that meets you where you already shop.\n\n2. You prefer to shop in person\n\nSpeaking of where you already shop, sometimes you just want to see products in person before you buy. But once you hit the one-year mark with the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae, you\u2019ll no longer earn 5% in-store by using Walmart Pay (your rewards rate will drop down to 2%). The Target Circle\u2122 Credit Card, a closed-loop card that can be used only at Target stores and on Target.com, offers a 5% discount on all eligible purchases in-store and online. The annual fee is $0, and unlike the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae, you'll get free shipping on all eligible items, regardless of how much you spend.\n\n3. You want a higher rewards rate on specific spending ...\n\nEarning 2% back on restaurants and travel definitely elevates this card above store cards that reward you only for shopping at that specific retailer. But if dining out and travel make up larger line items on your budget, other cards dole out the points more generously or offer more optimal redemption values.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card earns 5 points per $1 spent on all travel booked through Chase; 3 points per $1 spent on dining (including eligible delivery services and takeout), online grocery purchases (not including Target, Walmart and wholesale clubs), and select streaming services; 2 points per $1 spent on travel not booked through Chase; and 1 point per $1 spent on other purchases. There\u2019s a $95 annual fee, but there\u2019s also a generous sign-up bonus: Earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening. Plus, points are worth 1.25 cents each when redeemed for travel through Chase, and you'll get access to more than a dozen travel transfer partners to which you can move your points.\n\n4. ... Or you don't want to keep track of specific spending at all",

            "content": "Around 99% of all firms in OECD countries are small- and medium-sized businesses.\n\nHelping small businesses accelerate their digital journeys builds wider access to the digital economy.\n\nPartnerships across the public and private sector can support greater social inclusion and help businesses thrive.\n\nLeaders across the public and private sectors have long recognized the importance of supporting small businesses. Across OECD countries, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) represent around 99% of all firms, are a main source of employment and generate 50% to 60% of value added on average.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just about economies, it is about stronger communities and greater social inclusion. And by helping small businesses accelerate their digital journeys, it has a multiplier effect in building much wider access to the digital economy.\n\nSimple and secure technology\n\nDigitization is non-negotiable for small businesses today. According to a Mastercard study, 75% of small businesses incorporate digital tools into their daily operations, with two-thirds emphasizing the importance of a seamless digital experience for their success.\n\nHowever, achieving this smooth experience remains a challenge. One in four small business owners is overwhelmed by managing more than six different platforms each day, consuming two of their most precious resources: time and money.\n\nSMEs are also being left behind when it comes to accessing the most transformative technologies, putting them at a further disadvantage. And the more complex the technology \u2013 whether it be big data, cloud computing or artificial intelligence (AI) \u2013 the less likely it is that SMEs are adopting them, according to the OECD.\n\nIn particular, the potential of AI for small businesses is substantial: AI and data-first solutions can drive greater inclusion and resilience, enabling them to get capital, go digital, and grow networks and know-how.\n\nAI solutions can also help with protecting small businesses, that are often targeted by hackers precisely because of their size and lack of access to fraud prevention tools. In 2023, over 40% of cyberattacks were directed at small businesses.\n\nGiven the pressures of running a small business, it is impossible to expect owners to keep track of the latest updates or research the best network monitoring software, but trust with customers that has taken years to build can be shattered in seconds by a cybersecurity breach. In fact, around 60% of small businesses that experience a cyberattack go out of business within six months.\n\nAccelerating access to finance\n\nIncreased digitization can help to expand new credit opportunities for small businesses, tackling one of the biggest barriers to growth and success.\n\nThe International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that 65 million firms, representing 40% of formal micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in developing countries, face an annual financing gap of $5.2 trillion \u2013 equivalent to 1.4 times the current global MSME lending levels.\n\nA lack of access to credit creates massive challenges for small businesses \u2013 including cash flow, limited competitiveness and innovation, and a dependence on informal lending. Given the importance of small businesses to economies around the world, this is hindering efforts to address investment, job creation and income inequality. It is also a missed opportunity for banks and financial institutions, when approached in the right way.\n\nNew innovations will support this. By leveraging open banking, small business owners can share their financial data securely with lenders. This transparency allows for a more comprehensive assessment of creditworthiness, facilitating quicker and more inclusive lending decisions.\n\nFintech companies are increasingly developing innovative solutions tailored for small businesses, recognizing the opportunity presented by the long-standing gap in services and tools that meet the needs of SMEs. The latest Mastercard Start Path cohort features startups that are digitizing key functions for SMEs such as supply chains, spend management platforms, onboarding, risk monitoring and embedded financial solutions.\n\nThe next step is to drive forward stronger connections between fintech companies and traditional lenders to create new models that leverage digital tools to create and scale more flexible, customizable and cost effective credit and services solutions for small businesses.\n\nTaking a new approach\n\nPartnerships are the key to success. And we can\u2019t think across traditional lines \u2013 it needs a unique blend of the scale of the public sector, the local knowledge and reach of philanthropy and the innovation of the private sector. To better help small businesses, they need to be impactful, adaptable and scalable.\n\nFor example, in November 2024, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Mastercard Impact Fund, administered by the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, signed an agreement to catalyze lending for MSMEs, focusing on women-led or -owned businesses and access to climate finance. The partnership will support up to $1 billion of credit access to MSMEs over a four-year period through on-lending by financial institutions, complemented by Mastercard Impact Fund\u2019s grant of $5 million.\n\nAnother example is around helping to strengthen cybersecurity practices. In 2023, the Mastercard Strive EU program launched an Innovation Fund to identify innovative cybersecurity solutions, and improve awareness, preparedness and resilience for European small businesses.\n\nLupasafe, which supports small businesses by making cybersecurity effortless and affordable with the Lupasafe Cyber Monitor, was one of the grant winners. In Belgium, through its partnership with UNIZO \u2013 the largest Flemish organization for self-employed entrepreneurs \u2013 Lupasafe will provide small businesses with direct access to the platform, enabling them to receive immediate feedback on mitigating cyber risks and help them develop compliance with the EU\u2019s NIS2 regulatory framework.\n\nTogether, we have what it takes to help small businesses around the world to stay protected, to embrace new technologies and to thrive.",

            "content": "Increasing numbers of banks are releasing payment cards made of recycled plastics, but how do you get customers involved even further in the sustainability journey?\n\nOur latest Virtual Arena explores that challenge. We find out how banks can recycle expired payment cards, and involve the end-customers for the benefit of the local community.\n\nJoining us are industry leaders Maya Reisinger from G+D and Joe Pitcher from Mastercard to talk about the environmental benefits and challenges of card recycling, and the need for collaboration to scale impactful solutions.\n\nWatch this insightful conversation to find out more about\u2026\n\nHow recycling could drastically reduce plastic waste from billions of cards annually.\n\nHow Mastercard are working to address cost, security, and expertise gaps in recycling programs.\n\nThe exciting technology G+D are working on to help banks showcase ESG commitments effectively.\n\nWhat is Card Recycling?\n\nOf course, first things first, it was important to know what card recycling entails. Maya Reisinger, who is Product Management Director of the Convego Beyond portfolio at G+D, introduced this as a method of repurposing expired payment cards instead of discarding them in landfills. She emphasized the flexibility in this approach, noting that some banks integrate recycling into their ESG commitments without publicizing it, while others use it as a tool for customer engagement. G+D are committed to helping banks be more sustainable with a number of focused offerings.\n\nJoe Pitcher is Vice President of the sustainable cards program at Mastercard & also happens to be Chair of the Greener Payments Partnership, so he made for an ideal contributor to this conversation. He elaborated, describing card recycling as a shift from traditional disposal methods to redirecting these materials into reusable streams. It\u2019s important of course to ensure consumers and institutions are clued up on sustainable practices and mentioned Mastercard\u2019s research into advanced recycling methods, such as chemical recycling, to further innovate in this space.\n\nWhy is Card Recycling Worth Pursuing?\n\nBoth speakers stressed the environmental and symbolic value of card recycling. Reisinger explained that recycling aligns with the industry\u2019s broader sustainability goals, reducing waste and the carbon footprint associated with virgin plastic production.\n\nPitcher quantified the potential impact, noting that recycling even a fraction of the billions of cards produced annually could eliminate significant amounts of plastic waste. Just think, there were 17.45 billion credit, debit, and prepaid cards in circulation worldwide as of the end of 2023. That\u2019s a lot of plastic. He framed these efforts as small but crucial steps towards sustainable goals, signaling the banking industry\u2019s commitment to sustainability.\n\nThe Challenges Facing Banks in Card Recycling\n\nImplementing card recycling programs presents hurdles for banks, including concerns over data security, cost management, and finding the right recycling partners. Pitcher pointed out that many banks lack expertise in recycling, making it difficult to know where to start. Mastercard has addressed this by partnering with TerraCycle and creating scalable programs to simplify participation and reduce costs.\n\nReisinger added that banks often struggle to allocate resources to such initiatives, as recycling is not their core focus. G+D helps by tailoring solutions to individual banks\u2019 needs, from secure card collection to partnerships with local recyclers. A partnership they have with Santander are an example of this, where G+D manages card shredding and recycling whilst the bank can document compliance with ESG standards.\n\nA Shared Vision for Sustainability\n\nBoth Reisinger and Pitcher highlighted the importance of collaboration in overcoming barriers and driving scale. Pitcher emphasized the role of economies of scale in making recycling programs more cost-effective, urging banks to pool efforts under unified programs. Reisinger reinforced the need for external expertise, noting that G+D leverages its global partnerships and experience to streamline processes for banks, making recycling programs feasible and impactful.\n\nThe discussion also touched on the broader sustainability landscape. G+D is the first payment card provider to pledge the end of using virgin plastic in payment card products by 2030. In parallel, Pitcher noted Mastercard\u2019s mandate to eliminate first-use PVC from card production by 2028, encouraging the use of recycled or bio-based materials. Reisinger also discussed G+D\u2019s lifecycle analysis approach. This means ensuring sustainability considerations run all the way through to product design and material choices from the outset.\n\nCard recycling won\u2019t solve all environmental challenges, but it turns a challenge into opportunity and it represents a significant step forward for the financial sector. It may even increase customer trust in their bank.\n\nTo watch more great conversations like this one, on all areas of banking, payments and fintech, be sure to check out more of our Virtual Arena\u2019s on ffnews.com.",

Mastercard is one of the largest payment processors in the world by market cap and the number of payments processed.\n\nMastercard was founded in 1966 as Master Charge: The Interbank Card. The company was created to respond to the growing need for a secure and reliable payment processing system. In 1979, the company changed its name to Mastercard. Mastercard is in over 200 countries and territories and serves over 2.8 billion cardholders.\n\nMastercard operates on a business-to-business (B2B) model, providing payment processing services to financial institutions, merchants and governments. The company earns revenue primarily through transaction processing fees, cross-border fees and other value-added services. Mastercard's business is divided into four segments: domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees, transaction processing fees and additional revenue.\n\nMastercard's financial performance has been consistently strong in recent years, with revenue and earnings growth driven by increased transaction volumes and higher fees. Mastercard faces significant competition from other payment processing companies, including Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) and PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL). However, Mastercard has maintained its position as one of the largest payment processors in the world due to its strong brand recognition, global network and innovative technology solutions.\n\nMastercard has consistently invested in innovative technology to enhance its payment processing solutions. One of the company's most significant innovations in recent years is Mastercard's tokenization technology, which provides a secure way to process payments without exposing cardholder data. Mastercard has also invested heavily in contactless payment technology, which has become increasingly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMastercard has a solid commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability. The company has set ambitious goals to reduce its carbon footprint, increase financial inclusion and promote gender equality. Mastercard is also actively involved in philanthropic efforts, including the Mastercard Foundation, which focuses on advancing financial inclusion in Africa.\n\nAs with any company, Mastercard faces several risk factors that could impact its financial performance. One of the most significant risks facing Mastercard is the potential for increased regulation of the payment processing industry. Mastercard is also vulnerable to changes in consumer behavior, such as a shift away from traditional payment methods toward mobile payments. Additionally, Mastercard's business depends on the overall health of the global economy, which could be impacted by factors such as inflation, geopolitical tensions and natural disasters.",

            "content": "The Merchant Category Code (MCC) is the all-important four-digit number that describes a merchant\u2019s primary business activities. Banks offer bonus miles based on MCCs, so the right MCC can be all the difference between earning a ton of miles on a big ticket purchase, or walking away empty-handed.\n\nIt used to be that MCCs were completely opaque to cardholders, and the only way to discover them was to make a small test transaction, wait a few days, then call up the bank and ask how it coded.\n\nThankfully, things are a lot simpler these days. Even though the Visa Supplier Locator is no longer available to the general public, there\u2019s three even better ways of finding the MCC without spending a single cent.\n\nHow can you find the MCC?\n\nBelow is a summary of the three options that cardholders can use to discover MCCs.\n\nMethod Ease of Use Reliability \u2753 Heymax \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf \u25cf \ud83d\udcf1 Instarem app \u25cf\u25cf \u25cf\u25cf \ud83e\udd16 DBS digibot \u25cf\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nI want to emphasise upfront that \u201cease of use\u201d and \u201creliability\u201d are all relative. Heymax already provides a solid baseline for reliability, and the DBS digibot is still simple enough to use, despite requiring more steps than the other two methods.\n\nHere\u2019s how each of these works, and potential pitfalls to take note of.\n\nHeymax\n\nHeymax Sign up for a Heymax account with the code MILELION and get 700 Max Miles as a welcome bonus after adding a card, purchasing a voucher and viewing the redemption page \u2713 Key Advantages Extremely simple UX\n\nCan search for merchants without having to make a test charge \ud83d\udfad Key Disadvantages Hard to find smaller merchants, and merchants where the brand name is different from the legal business name\n\nCannot provide definitive answer for merchants which process transactions under a range of MCCs\n\nProvides MCCs based on Visa; there is a slight (though remote) chance that Mastercard codes differently\n\nHeymax is the most idiot-proof solution for looking up MCCs: just type in the merchant and hit enter. There\u2019s no need to block a card, test a transaction, or even have access to the merchant.\n\nWhile it\u2019s generally reliable, you might not be able to find the specific merchant you\u2019re looking for, possibly because it processes transactions under a different legal name from the customer-facing entity.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s less useful in situations where a merchant processes transactions under a range of MCCs (e.g. e-commerce sites like Amazon, Lazada, Qoo10, Shopee). It can list all the potential MCCs, but can\u2019t tell you exactly which one will be used.\n\nIn these cases, it\u2019s better to use the Instarem or DBS digibot methods outlined below so you can be certain that whatever appears there is how the actual transaction will code.\n\nAlso note that Heymax taps the Visa API to look up MCCs. There is a slight (though remote) chance that Mastercard may use a different MCC.\n\n\u2753 Does that really happen? It\u2019s very rare you\u2019ll have a situation where Visa and Mastercard throw up different MCCs, but it\u2019s not impossible. Cast your mind back to early 2020, when Mastercard classified GrabPay top-ups as MCC 6540 (POI Funding Transactions), but Visa classified it as MCC 7399 (Business Services Not Elsewhere Classified). This meant you could earn 4 mpd on GrabPay top-ups with the Citi Rewards Visa, but not the Mastercard! That didn\u2019t last forever, of course, but it\u2019s just an example of how the two card networks can sometimes sing a different tune.\n\nInstarem app\n\nInstarem \u2713 Key Advantages Fewer steps than digibot method \ud83d\udfad Key Disadvantages Provides MCCs based on Mastercard; there is a slight (though remote) chance that Visa codes differently\n\nAmaze Cardholders can use the Instarem app to check the MCC of a merchant, either by:\n\nBlocking all card functionality and attempting to make a transaction Paying by Amaze Wallet with an insufficient balance\n\nFor method (1), go to Card > Manage and disable both in-store purchases and online purchases.\n\nThen use your Amaze Card and attempt to make a transaction with the merchant in question (if you\u2019re prompted for an OTP, go ahead and enter it). It will fail, of course, but that\u2019s what we want.\n\nAfter the transaction fails, visit the Activity tab and you\u2019ll be able to see the MCC of the merchant.\n\nFor method (2) you don\u2019t need to disable anything. Simply select Amaze Wallet as the payment method and attempt to make a transaction, ensuring that the balance in the wallet is insufficient.\n\nThe transaction will again fail, but you can then go back to the Instarem app, tap on Activity, and see the failed transaction\u2019s details including MCC.\n\nThis method is extremely robust, but because Amaze is a Mastercard, and there is a very slight chance that if you were to do the transaction with a Visa card, the MCC may come out different. I want to emphasise it\u2019s highly unlikely, but you can\u2019t rule it out altogether.\n\nDBS digibot\n\ndigibot \u2713 Key Advantages 100% accuracy \ud83d\udfad Key Disadvantages Relatively more steps than the HeyMax or Instarem methods\n\nThe DBS digibot requires relatively more steps than HeyMax or Instarem, but will also provide the most accurate information. Simply put: there is no chance you\u2019ll get the wrong MCC if you follow the steps properly.\n\nThe first step is to temporarily block a DBS card via the DBS digibank app. You can do this by tapping More on the bottom right hand corner, then scrolling down until you see Payment Controls.\n\nSelect the card you wish to use, then toggle the card lock option. Ensure the card gets greyed out, with a lock symbol appearing on top.\n\nNow go to the merchant and attempt to make the transaction. It will fail, since your card is locked- that\u2019s exactly what we want to happen.\n\nReturn to the DBS digibank app or login to DBS ibanking and summon the digibot.\n\nFor the app, tap the question mark on the top right corner and scroll down to tap \u201cAsk digibot\u201d\n\nFor desktop, click the digibot icon at the bottom right corner\n\nNavigate to Check my Recent Transactions > Credit Cards > Select the card you used > View Transaction History > Declined Transactions.\n\nYou\u2019ll then see your failed transaction, together with the MCC.\n\nNow that you know the MCC, you can proceed to unblock the card and make the transaction for real (or use a different bank\u2019s card, whichever is more suitable).\n\nDo remember that Visa and Mastercard may, in rare cases, use different MCCs. So if you\u2019re blocking a Mastercard to make the test transaction, make sure the final card you use is also a Mastercard (and vice versa).\n\nMy preferred method\n\nFor me personally, the Instarem app method is the perfect balance between accuracy and convenience. In fact, I keep my Instarem card blocked most of the time, partly as an anti-fraud measure, but also because it\u2019s my default way of checking MCCs.\n\nYes, it does mean that every transaction involves a couple more steps than usual, but with miles on the line, a little extra hassle is bearable.\n\nConclusion\n\nOpaque MCCs are a thing of the past now, with cardholders having multiple ways of verifying an MCC before spending a single cent.\n\nWhile it might not be worth the hassle to do with a S$5 coffee, I would certainly make a point of checking before swiping any big ticket purchase.",

            "content": "Aussies have been warned they could effectively continue to pay card surcharges even if Labor scraps them as many major businesses back the government\u2019s move.\n\nThe RBA on Friday released submissions into its review of merchant card payment costs after the government several months earlier announced plans to outlaw debit card surcharges in another move to ease cost of living pressures.\n\nMerchant fees comprise three aspects: interchange fees paid to the bank, scheme fees that go to companies like Visa and Mastercard, and acquirer margin which is paid to the bank that supplies the physical payment terminal.\n\nCommonwealth Bank called on the RBA to scrap both credit and debit card surcharges while Westpac only supported bans on debit surcharges, NAB opposes a blanket ban on surcharging and ANZ called for a \u201cuniform approach\u201d to surcharges.\n\nThe government announced plans to scrap debit card surcharges in a bid to ease cost of living pressures. Picture: Getty\n\nMeanwhile, Visa and Mastercard have both called for an end to all surcharges while Qantas and Virgin Australia both oppose them.\n\nThe Australia Competition and Consumer Commission, which received about 2500 reports of businesses allegedly imposing illegal card surcharges in 2024, called for reform amid growing concerns about the payments.\n\n\u201cGreater costs have fallen on the actors in the system with the least bargaining power \u2013 consumers and small business merchants,\u201d the ACCC said in its submission.\n\nWhile the consumer watchdog barracked for smaller businesses, Brad Kelly, the co-founder of Independent Payments Forum which greatly urged for more transparency into the merchant fee process in its submission, attacked the ACCC.\n\n\u201cThe ACCC needs to find its teeth because they're obviously the ones who can take action on this,\u201d Mr Kelly told SkyNews.com.au.\n\nHe said small businesses were hindered by high card surcharges with some merchants stung with flat fee rates of around one and a half to two per cent while the actual cost of a transaction was just one or two cents.\n\nMr Kelly highlighted the enormous merchant fee disparities between major players and small businesses in a call for urgent overall reform.\n\n\u201cThe big merchants, like the two supermarkets and big box retailers, do not pay the same amount as a small business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSupermarkets (are) getting away with one cent for a debit transaction, but your caf\u00e9 is being charged two per cent for the same thing.\u201d\n\nHe noted the large card surcharges and thin profit margins of small businesses meant outright scrapping the payment would ultimately leave Aussie consumers in the same position.\n\n\u201cWhilst it's all well good to ban surcharges, the fact of the matter is that the cost will then be pushed back onto the small business,\u201d Mr Kelly said.\n\n\u201cFor instance, in a caf\u00e9 their margins are somewhere between two and four per cent. If you charge a caf\u00e9 2 per cent, you've taken their margin away from them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Pfisterer, the CEO of fintech start-up Zeller, also warned that customers should expect to effectively pay the surcharge as small businesses passed their costs along.\n\n\u201cWhile consumers might feel better no longer seeing a surcharge applied, they would still be paying the increased costs and the industry would no longer have any visibility into payment costs,\u201d Mr Pfisterer told SkyNews.com.au.\n\n\u201cThis would undo a lot of the work that has been implemented over the last decade to ensure costs are transparent and declining due to increased competition.\u201d\n\nThe Australian Restaurant & Caf\u00e9 Association called for lower interchange fees to facilitate small businesses which it said, in its submission to the RBA, would lead to lower costs for customers.\n\nIt also warned that outright scrapping debit surcharges without touching interchange fees would mean Aussies end up paying the same amount.\n\n\u201cWithout any changes to interchange, simply banning debit surcharges will not likely lead to the desired consumer cost reduction outcomes, with ARCA Member and Industry Data from an extensive industry wide survey showing nearly 86 (per cent) restaurants & cafes would pass on merchant fees with increased menu prices if forced to absorb them,\u201d ARCA said.\n\nMeanwhile the CEO of the Council of Small Businesses Organisations Australia Luke Achterstraat echoed ARCA\u2019s sentiment, arguing a potential change would put small businesses in a precarious position.\n\n\u201cSmall businesses will be between a rock and a hard place and will be forced to increase their menu prices across the board to cover that cost,\u201d Mr Achterstraat told SkyNews.com.au.\n\nMr Achterstraat warned businesses would be forced to hike their prices if card surcharges were scrapped. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nHe called on the government to thoroughly evaluate all aspects of changes to card surcharges as Labor looks to score points with voters in the lead up to the election.\n\n\u201cWe are certainly cautioning the government to tread very lightly and tread very carefully before any sort of blanket bans are imposed on debit cards or credit cards,\u201d he said.\n\nThe submissions come after Labor vowed to crackdown on the surcharges in October with Treasurer Jim Chalmers stressing that small businesses be protected.\n\n\u201cThis is all about getting a better deal for consumers, reducing costs for small businesses and promoting a more competitive payments system,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cConsumers shouldn\u2019t be punished for using cards or digital payments, and at the same time, small businesses shouldn\u2019t have to pay hefty fees just to get paid themselves.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re prepared to ban debit card surcharges, subject to further work by the Reserve Bank and safeguards to ensure small businesses and consumers can both benefit from lower costs.\u201d",

            "content": "Checkout is the last mile in commerce, representing the critical moments of decision-making that can make or break a sale \u2014 and by extension, merchants\u2019 fortunes.\n\nJoint research from PYMNTS Intelligence and Mastercard in the \u201cOnline Merchant Checkout Innovation Report\u201d found that more companies encounter trouble with their checkout processes than with payments processing. It\u2019s a global issue, illustrated in the pain points experienced by merchants in the United States and four other markets surveyed by PYMNTS Intelligence, including Australia, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. Six in 10 middle-market firms said they struggled with the user experience during checkout online.\n\nMastercard\u2019s Jennifer Macrae, senior vice president of global digital channel enablement, and Sukhmani Dev, senior vice president of North America digital product management, said the problem is acute enough that more than three-quarters of merchants are looking for ways to streamline checkout to boost sales conversions.\n\n\u201cThe user experience is critical \u2026 friction is directly correlated with loss of sales\u2019 conversion rates and therefore the merchants\u2019 bottom lines,\u201d Macrae said.\n\nMore than ever, there are various high-tech tools and solutions, including artificial intelligence and biometrics, to help modernize checkout.\n\nHowever, as Macrae and Dev told PYMNTS, it takes a village. Mastercard is working with issuing partners and other stakeholders to eliminate passwords, beef up security and keep checkout simple when consumers decide to complete a purchase.\n\nA Collaborative Effort\n\n\u201cCollaboration is the key word,\u201d said Dev, who added that \u201cwe\u2019ve been able to bring an ecosystem together to make mobile wallets and tap to pay more secure.\u201d\n\nConsumers using a Mastercard product in a mobile wallet are using network tokens that improve authorization rates and push fraud rates lower. Tokenization allows merchants to replace sensitive card-related information with a unique identifier, which also improves payment processing, Dev said. In the U.S. alone, 1 in 3 eCommerce transactions already use the technology, and approval rates see a 3 to 6 percentage point increase, along with several points of fraud reduction.\n\n\u201cIn fact, globally, this technology is responsible for delivering $2 billion in incremental sales for merchants each month,\u201d said Dev, adding that \u201cthe scale is important, and the value is tremendous.\u201d\n\nMore recently, the company introduced its checkout services platform for merchants. The platform is built on the EMV SRC standard, enabling merchants to implement one-click checkout solutions including Click to Pay and Secure Card on File solutions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about driving value through choice and transparency,\u201d said Macrae, adding that the same principles that have improved in-store commerce (through tap to pay) have driven the move to create a standard click-through experience online, which means that consumers no longer must struggle to input their card details online.\n\nMacrae and Dev said Click to Pay is reducing friction at checkout so significantly that checkout times are cut in half when measured against entering card-specific details manually. The feature is available in over 50 countries and integrated with more than 95 channel partners.\n\n\u201cThe time\u2019s been right to declare our ambition of creating a future where physical card numbers that are needed for purchases are a thing of the past, and one-time passcodes become obsolete\u201d with the embrace of passkeys and biometrics, Macrae said. \u201cWe\u2019re aiming to make sure that every transaction is tokenized and authenticated.\u201d\n\nAdded Dev: \u201cPartnership and collaboration are key, and Mastercard is locking hands with our issuing partners, digital partners and one-click solutions providers to help capitalize on the momentum.\u201d",

After all, your credit score is just one of many considerations issuers take into account when deciding whether to approve a consumer for a card.\n\nMASKOT/GETTY IMAGES\n\nBut you'll generally need a good credit score of at least 670 or higher to be approved for a rewards credit card like the Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select Mastercard. That said, it's possible to get denied if your score is high, even if other aspects of your credit portfolio may be appealing to the issuer.\n\nRelated: How do credit scores work?\n\n\n\nWhat is the Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select?\n\nThe Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select is a cobranded American Airlines credit card issued by Citi. This credit card can easily be worth the $99 annual fee (waived for the first year) even if you only fly American Airlines domestically a few times per year.\n\nThis is because by simply having this card you and up to four companions traveling with you on the same reservation get your first checked bag free on domestic American Airlines itineraries.\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\n\nYou'll also earn 2 miles per dollar spent at gas stations, restaurants and on eligible American Airlines purchases.\n\nDaily Newsletter Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter Join over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG\u2019s experts Email address Sign up By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy .

However, it does seem to have a maximum credit line that it is willing to extend across all of your Citi cards.\n\nDRS PRODUCOES/GETTY IMAGES\n\nSo, if you have at least one other Citi credit card and aren't approved for a new card, you may want to call Citi's reconsideration line to see if shifting some credit from one of your current cards will allow you to open the new card.\n\nRelated: How many credit cards should I have?\n\n\n\nWho is eligible for a welcome bonus?\n\nYou won't be eligible to earn a welcome bonus on the Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select Mastercard if you've received a welcome bonus for the card within the last 48 months.\n\nBEN SMITHSON/THE POINTS GUY\n\nSpecifically, the pricing and information section on the application page for this card notes:\n\nAmerican Airlines AAdvantage\u00ae bonus miles are not available if you have received a new account bonus for a Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae account in the past 48 months or if you converted another Citi credit card account on which you earned a new account bonus in the last 48 months into a Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae account.\n\nRelated: What you need to know about earning another American Airlines card welcome bonus\n\n\n\nHow to check your credit score\n\nThere are many ways to check your credit score for free. For example, many credit cards let you check your FICO score at no cost to you. It's a good idea to track the progression of your score over time, especially if you're working to improve your credit score.\n\nSOLSTOCK/GETTY IMAGES\n\nBut it's important to realize that you don't have just one credit score. Instead, there are different calculation methods, such as FICO Score and VantageScore, and different credit reporting agencies, such as TransUnion and Experian.\n\nYour credit score will vary based on the calculation method and credit reporting agency that is used.\n\nRelated: 6 things to do to improve your credit\n\nFactors that affect your credit score\n\nOnce you know your credit score range, you may wonder what factors affect your credit score. There are a few formulas for calculating your credit score, but none of the exact calculations are public.\n\nFICO\n\nThis being said, FICO is relatively transparent about the different factors they assess and how much weight each is given:\n\nPayment history (35%) : Whether you've paid past credit accounts on time\n\n: Whether you've paid past credit accounts on time Amounts owed (30%) : The relative size of your current debt and the ratio of your current debt to your available credit\n\n: The relative size of your current debt and the ratio of your current debt to your available credit Length of credit history (15%) : How long your credit accounts have been established (including the age of your oldest account, the age of your newest account and the average age of all your accounts), how long certain credit accounts have been established and how long it has been since you used certain accounts\n\n: How long your credit accounts have been established (including the age of your oldest account, the age of your newest account and the average age of all your accounts), how long certain credit accounts have been established and how long it has been since you used certain accounts New credit (10%) : The number of accounts you've opened recently\n\n: The number of accounts you've opened recently Credit mix (10%): The number of different types of credit accounts you have. This includes credit cards, retail accounts, installment loans, finance company accounts and mortgage loans\n\nRelated: 4 common credit score myths\n\nWhat to do if you get rejected\n\nIf your application is rejected, you'll get a letter in the mail that states why Citi turned down your application. Depending on the reasons given for the rejection, you may want to use this information to improve your credit score before applying again.\n\nOr, if you believe you can provide additional information that might lead to approval of your application, you can call Citi's reconsideration line at 1-800-695-5171 and make your case.\n\nMASKOT/GETTY IMAGES\n\nYou'll want to explain that you recently applied for the Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select World Elite Mastercard, were surprised to see that your application was rejected and ask to speak to someone about getting that decision reconsidered.\n\nOnce the agent pulls up your application, be prepared to present a compelling argument for why Citi should approve your application.\n\nRelated: 5 things to check before applying for your next credit card\n\n\n\nHow long to wait before applying again\n\nIt's best to avoid applying again for a Citi card until you've addressed the reasons Citi gave for rejecting you.\n\nIZUSEK/GETTY IMAGES\n\nBut, if you want to apply again or apply for a different Citi card, the consensus is that you can only apply for one Citi card (personal or business) every eight days and no more than two cards in a 65-day window.\n\nRelated: The ultimate guide to credit card application restrictions\n\nDo you get lounge access?\n\nNo, you do not get lounge access as a cardholder of the Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select Mastercard.\n\nZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY\n\nIf you're looking for Admirals Club access when flying American Airlines, you should consider the $595 annual fee Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Executive World Elite Mastercard\u00ae (see rates and fees).\n\nThis card provides full membership access privileges to Admirals Club lounges for the primary cardholder.\n\nRelated: Best credit cards for airport lounge access\n\nDo you get a free checked bag?\n\nAs a Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select cardholder, you and up to four companions traveling with you on the same reservation will each get a first checked bag free on domestic itineraries marketed by American Airlines and operated by American Airlines or American Eagle.\n\nDARYA KOMAROVA/GETTY IMAGES\n\nTo take advantage of this benefit, your credit card account must be open at least seven days before travel, and the reservation must include the primary credit card member's American Airlines AAdvantage number at least seven days before travel. Overweight and oversize fees still apply.\n\nRelated: How to avoid checked baggage fees on major domestic airlines\n\nBottom line\n\nThere's no single best credit card for American Airlines flyers. Instead, the best card for you depends on what you're looking for in a card. The Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select and AAdvantage\u00ae Aviator\u00ae Red World Elite Mastercard are both good options for American Airlines travelers who fly with the airline frequently enough to get at least $99 of value from the card's checked bag allowance on domestic American Airlines itineraries.\n\nThe information for the AAdvantage Aviator Red card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\nThese cards have different earning rates and benefits, so you just have to decide which card's benefits you prefer.\n\nLearn more: Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select World Elite Mastercard full review",

This dynamic directly supports higher transaction volumes, which form the backbone of Mastercard's revenue.\n\nMastercard also stands to gain from increased cross-border activity, a high-margin segment of its business that benefits from heightened global travel and trade when economic conditions improve.\n\nAdditionally, businesses may expand their payment technology infrastructure during periods of economic growth, potentially boosting Mastercard\u2019s ecosystem of services.\n\nRead Also: Oil Dips As Israeli Security Cabinet Approves Gaza Ceasefire, Yet Experts Warn Red Sea Risks Persist\n\nHow To Buy MA Stock\n\nBesides going to a brokerage platform to purchase a share \u2013 or fractional share \u2013 of stock, you can also gain access to shares either by buying an exchange traded fund (ETF) that holds the stock itself, or by allocating yourself to a strategy in your 401(k) that would seek to acquire shares in a mutual fund or other instrument.\n\nFor example, in Mastercard\u2019s case, it is in the Financials sector. An ETF will likely hold shares in many liquid and large companies that help track that sector, allowing an investor to gain exposure to the trends within that segment.\n\nAccording to data from Benzinga Pro, MA has a 52-week high of $537.70 and a 52-week low of $427.45.",

            "content": "about In Tech In Tech is our regular feature highlighting what people are talking about in the world of technology \u2014 everything from crypto and NFTs to smart cities and cybersecurity.\n\nIn the U.S., there\u2019s a prevailing narrative, propelled in part by politics, that the electric vehicle boom is over. But while growth is slowing, new figures released during the annual Detroit Auto Show point to strong sales globally, with a 25.6% year-on-year increase in December for fully-electric and plug-in hybrids. And even in the U.S. and Canada, EV sales rose nearly 9% in December.\n\nBut the leader in EV adoption is Norway, according to the BBC, with 88.9% of new cars sold in the country in 2024 electric.\n\nThe government there has long held supportive legislation making electric cars a more attractive and economically viable option for consumers. Dating back to the \u201890s, the transition to EVs involved consistent policies like tax incentives for EVs and higher taxes for petrol and diesel cars. Other perks include free parking and access to bus lanes.\n\n\"We think it's wrong to advise a customer coming in here today to buy an ICE [internal combustion engine] car, because the future is electric,\" says Ulf Tore Hekneby, chief executive of the Oslo-based car dealership Harald A M\u00f8ller. \"Long-range, high-charging speed. It's hard to go back.\"\n\nDespite being a major oil and gas producer, and even after early Norwegian EV manufacturers ceased operations, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be zero emissions this year.\n\nEven more vital to widespread adoption, Norway supports a comprehensive network of public charging stations. This extensive infrastructure ensures that EVs are convenient to use, even in colder climates where battery performance can be an issue. As a result, consumers have adapted their habits to charge whenever possible instead of waiting until necessary.\n\nIndeed, another new study out in conjunction with the Detroit Auto Show reveals that infrastructure is a sticking point for car buyers globally \u2014 60% of those surveyed by Tata Consultancy Services say charging infrastructure was a major challenge (although 64% said that an EV is likely to be their next vehicle).\n\nAt the Detroit show, Jeep showed off its first all-electric SUV, the all-wheel-drive midsize Wagoneer S, and Cadillac highlighted the Vistiq, adding a new three-row SUV to its EV lineup. And last week at CES, Honda stole the show with the debut of its electric 0 series prototypes, including the futuristic, wedge-shaped 0 Saloon, and the news that it could go on sale in North America next year.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla recently unveiled the facelifted version of their popular Model Y on its China consumer site, indicating that the automaker may be ready to start production on the updated vehicle.\n\nAccording to a report by the German publication Handelsblatt (and echoed in Road & Track), the first European models of the Model Y could roll off the production line as early as this week.\n\nAlthough Tesla this month reported the first full-year drop in sales in its history as a public company, the Tesla Model Y continues to be a juggernaut for the company, becoming the fourth biggest-selling car in the U.S. trailing the Ford F-series pickup, the Chevy Silverado pickup, and the Toyota RAV4, according to Car & Driver.\n\nThe Australian publication Drive, reports that the Model Y is expected to arrive in Australia by May. That said, there\u2019s been no official announcement from Tesla regarding the U.S. release date.\n\nThe updates to the Model Y closely mirror those applied to the Model 3 sedan last year, which includes a revised front end with a new bumper and headlight assembly and a new taillamp that spans the hatchback. Inside, the Y benefits from improved material quality similar to the Model 3, while notably retaining the turn-signal stalk \u2014 a feature that many drivers appreciate.\n\nAlthough U.S. pricing for the refreshed Model Y has yet to be announced, it\u2019s anticipated that the new model will not deviate significantly from the current price of $44,630.\n\nWith a major redesign to appeal to a new generation, Chuck E. Cheese is making a comeback four years after emerging from bankruptcy, CNBC reports. And yes, sadly, that means those animatronics are gone.\n\nEven though it emerged from their financial woes, another threat loomed: entertaining a new era of tech-savvy children and their parents.\n\nChuck E. Cheese, founded in 1977 in San Jose by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, has become an iconic childhood institution because of its pizza, birthday parties, and animatronic mouse mascot and band. But the days of physical tickets, SkyTube tubes, and animatronics are over.\n\nCEO Dave McKillips says the idea pulling the robots came with some debate but ultimately was a no-brainer. \u201cKids were consuming entertainment in such a different way, you know, growing up with screens and ever-changing bite-sized entertainment.\u201d These days, the 470 locations feature trampolines, a smartphone app, tons of arcade games and floor-to-ceiling jumbotrons.\n\nAccording to McKillips, Chuck E. Cheese is looking into various entertainment collaborations that would turn its mouse mascot into a major character, in addition to 30 license agreements for items ranging from clothing to frozen pizzas. Embracing the 21st century continues with a YouTube account with almost a half million subscribers who tune in for videos featuring their cast of characters and six albums of music featuring Chuck E.

            "content": "Update:The offer mentioned below has expired and is no longer available.\n\nMilestone Card at a Glance\n\nThe Milestone card is issued by the Bank of Missouri and serviced by Genesis FS Card Services, Inc. This card is specifically designed to help people establish payment history. Because this card is a Mastercard, you can use it on everyday purchases and it is widely accepted abroad.\n\nIt notes that the card \u201cenables you to enjoy the benefits of a Mastercard without the need for a security deposit.\u201d This card doesn\u2019t offer the opportunity to earn any rewards like points or cash-back, however, it does come with some benefits since it is a Mastercard. These additional benefits include:\n\nMastercard ID Theft Protection\n\nZero Liability Protection (a.k.a. fraud protection)\n\nHot Tip: You can read more in the Mastercard Guide to Benefits that details all of the program terms and conditions.\n\nThe Milestone card is an unsecured credit card, which means that you have access to a credit limit without needing to put down a security deposit. Unfortunately, the credit limit offered on this card is $700, with no opportunity for credit limit increases.\n\nIn addition, your account history is reported to all 3 major credit bureaus, so this can help you establish a consistent payment record while enjoying the convenience of a credit card.\n\nYou can also use this card to take out cash at an ATM (up to your credit limit), but you will incur cash advance fees of the higher of $5 or 5% each time you withdraw money. This is free in your first year, though!\n\nBalance transfers are not allowed with this card.\n\nMilestone Card Application\n\nTo apply now for the Milestone card, head over to the website.\n\nOnce you apply, you will typically receive an answer right away. However, if the decision is pending, you can check your Milestone card application status by calling 866-502-6439 and using the automated system. This system is available 24/7. If you prefer, you can also speak to a customer service representative from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. PST every day.\n\nMinimum Credit Score and Other Requirements\n\nThere is no minimum credit score required to be approved for the Milestone card and it is meant to be a great credit-establishing tool. This means that it has extremely flexible credit requirements in general, including accepting applicants with a history of bankruptcies.\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee you will be approved for this card even if you have a higher credit score as other factors (like income and debt) are taken into consideration.\n\nTo qualify for the Milestone card, you will need to meet certain minimum requirements:\n\nBe at least 18 years old (19 in Alabama)\n\nApply from a U.S. IP address\n\nNot have had a Milestone card account that was charged off due to delinquency\n\nProvide: Your name Email address Physical address Date of birth Social Security number Monthly income and expenses\n\n\n\nBottom Line: Using this information, Milestone will review your income, your debt, and conduct identity verification to determine eligibility.\n\nHow To Increase Your Credit Limit\n\nUnfortunately, the Milestone card doesn\u2019t offer any credit increases, even with a history of timely payments.\n\nHot Tip: You should consider a secured card if you are looking for a card with a higher credit limit. If you are able to make a larger security deposit upfront, the credit limit will generally match your deposit amount.\n\nMilestone Card Online Login\n\nUse Milestone\u2019s website to activate your new Milestone card online and create your online account. You can even log in to monitor your Milestone card account activity, pay your bill, view transactions, and check your balance through this link.\n\nPaying Your Milestone Card Bill\n\nThere are multiple options you can use to make payments on your Milestone card.\n\nOnline\n\nTo access your account, log in to your account and click My Account or via the Bill Pay tab. Once you are logged in to your account, you can enroll to receive paperless statements, check your monthly bills, and make payments via direct deposit or bank transfer.\n\nHot Tip: You cannot use a debit card to make payments to your Milestone card account.\n\nBe sure to submit your payments by 5 p.m. PST to ensure that it\u2019s credited on the same day.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no Milestone mobile app at this time.\n\nBy Phone\n\nYou can make payments by phone by calling Milestone\u2019s customer service line at 866-453-2636. A customer service agent is available between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. PST Monday through Friday.\n\nBy Mail\n\nYou can send a check or money order to pay your Milestone bill by mail. Payments should be mailed to:\n\nGenesis FS Card Services\n\nP.O. Box 84059\n\nColumbus, GA 31908-4059\n\nHot Tip: Milestone notes that you should allow 7 days for a check to be received and processed. This means you need to plan well in advance of your payment due date to avoid late fees and interest charges.\n\nBy MoneyGram\n\nFirst, you will need to locate your nearest MoneyGram location. Then you will need the following information:\n\nCompany Name: Genesis FS Card Services\n\nReceive Code: 4911\n\nBenefits of the Milestone Card\n\nThis card is made for those with no credit history or less-than-perfect credit, so the main benefits revolve around credit-establishing. It is also backed by Mastercard, making it convenient to use as it is widely accepted.\n\nEasy Application\n\nThe Milestone card advertises itself as a good option for those establishing their payment history, so having financial blemishes on your record shouldn\u2019t prevent you from being approved for this card.\n\nThis is great news for those people hoping to improve their credit score. While the credit limit is small, making consistent payments and paying off your balance each month will lead to credit score increases in no time.\n\nCredit Establishing\n\nThe Milestone card reports to all 3 major credit bureaus each month when your billing statement is generated. The 3 major consumer credit bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian) will note your history of responsible payments and reflect this in your credit score.\n\nWhile no credit limits are offered with this card, you can qualify for better credit cards with higher credit limits in the future.\n\nDrawbacks of the Milestone Card\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to decide if the Milestone card is the best choice for you, you should be aware that there are some big downsides to this card.\n\nVery Low Credit Limit and No Increases\n\nThe credit limit is only $700 (with no opportunities to increase it) and is initially lower due to fees. If you have a low credit limit, each purchase brings you higher to your credit limit. This makes it easy to rack up high credit utilization which can hurt your credit score.\n\nHot Tip: If you have the money upfront, you might be better served with a secured credit card. The credit limit is generally as high as the amount you can set up as a security deposit.\n\nAnnual Fee\n\nThere are no opportunities to avoid an annual fee with this card. You\u2019ll want to review the terms associated with the card to learn more about the annual fee.\n\nBottom Line: In short, the higher the annual fee, the less appealing this card becomes due to the low credit limit.\n\nHigh APR and Fees\n\nYou\u2019ll want to see the terms for the regular purchase APR and penalty APR on this card, so if you carry a balance, interest charges could add up quickly.\n\nTo contact customer service, call 866-453-2636.\n\nIf you would like to use your card to access cash at ATMs, you can also call this number to request a PIN be sent to you via mail.\n\nIf you prefer to contact by mail:\n\nGenesis FS Card Services\n\nP.O. Box 4477\n\nBeaverton, OR 97076-4477\n\nAlternative Credit Cards (Our Recommendations)\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in other credit-establishing card options, we have a few alternative recommendations.\n\nThe Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card doesn\u2019t charge an annual fee (rates & fees) and also provides access to a higher credit limit after the first 5 months of on-time payments, with no additional deposits needed.

It's also a great pick for anyone looking to diversify their loyalty portfolio.\n\nHere are the top six reasons why you may want to add it to your wallet.\n\nThe information for the Citi AAdvantage Platinum card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\nSizable welcome offer\n\nNew AAdvantage Platinum Select cardholders can earn 50,000 bonus miles after spending $2,500 on purchases in the first three months of account opening.\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\n\nBased on TPG's January 2025 valuations, these 50,000 miles are worth about $825. From round-trip first-class flights to Alaska to one-way premium economy flights to Europe or Asia, there are plenty of ways to make excellent use of those miles \u2014 especially when redeeming for partner awards in and out of the Oneworld Alliance.\n\nThe card has offered up to 75,000 bonus miles in the past, so if you don't mind waiting for a larger welcome offer, it could be worth it.\n\nTPG credit cards writer Danyal Ahmed utilizes his AA miles for long-haul redemptions, such as flying nonstop in business class from the West Coast to Tokyo on Japan Airlines (JAL) for 60,000 miles one-way.\n\nFree checked bags\n\nThe Platinum Select World Elite Mastercard waives the first checked bag fee on domestic American Airlines-operated itineraries for you and up to four companions traveling on the same reservation.\n\nWhile this benefit isn't particularly unique to an airline credit card, it can be valuable for those without American Airlines elite status.\n\nDaily Newsletter Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter Join over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG\u2019s experts Email address Sign up By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy . You may unsubscribe at any time.\n\nPATRICK T. FALLON/THE POINTS GUY\n\nSince American charges $40 (or $35 if you pay online) for the first checked bag on domestic itineraries, it only takes four avoided first checked bag fees each year to offset the card's $99 annual fee (which is waived for the first year).\n\nBest of all, the benefit becomes linked to your AAdvantage account, so you can still book and pay for your tickets any way you'd like.\n\nPreferred boarding\n\nAs a cardholder, you and up to four customers traveling on the same reservation will receive Preferred Boarding for your flights, which means you'll board in Group 5.\n\nAmerican Airlines at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). SEAN CUDAHY/THE POINTS GUY\n\nThis perk is especially beneficial when flying basic economy on American since it means you'll have early access to overhead bin space and get to keep your usual carry-on allowance.\n\nAbility to earn a $125 flight credit\n\nThe Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select card also offers a $125 American Airlines flight credit after you make $20,000 in purchases in a cardmember year and renew your card. Your card must remain open for one full billing cycle after your card renews to receive the credit.\n\nThe credit is redeemable for flights marketed by American Airlines and must be used on itineraries originating in the U.S., Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\n25% off inflight purchases\n\nIf you frequently fly American domestically and purchase food or drinks on board, this benefit could save you some serious cash. You'll get 25% savings \u2014 applied via a statement credit \u2014 each time you use your Platinum Select World Elite Mastercard to purchase inflight food and beverages.\n\nOSCAR WONG/GETTY IMAGES\n\nSavings apply only to domestic flights marketed by American Airlines and operated by American or any of American's regional airlines.\n\nBonus miles at restaurants and gas stations\n\nIn addition to 2 miles per dollar on eligible American Airlines purchases and 1 mile per dollar for all other purchases, the card also offers 2 miles per dollar spent at restaurants and 2 miles per dollar spent at gas stations.\n\nSince TPG currently values American AAdvantage miles at 1.65 cents as of January 2025, you'll get a 3.3% return on eligible American Airlines purchases, at gas stations and restaurants.\n\nFREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/GETTY IMAGES\n\nWhile these returns aren't outstanding \u2014 and you can do better in each category with other cards \u2014 having bonus categories beyond extra points on AA purchases can come in handy when working to rack up AAdvantage miles.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select World Elite Mastercard is the best option for occasional AA flyers and anyone looking to score valuable premium-cabin redemptions on American partners, such as Cathay Pacific, Etihad and Japan Airlines.\n\nBesides the perks mentioned here, the card comes with some lesser-known benefits \u2014 including no foreign transaction fees \u2014 that apply when you use your card for purchases. If you frequently fly American Airlines and want elevated perks, this card is worth having.\n\nTo learn more, check out our full review of the AAdvantage Platinum Select.",

Later in the year, consumers will be able to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards when checking out online and in-app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nThe offering comes during what could be a pivotal year for buy now, pay later (BNPL) programs.\n\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cCash Flow Shortages Drive Consumers\u2019 BNPL Usage\u201d found that BNPL is prized by consumers as a flexible alternative to traditional credit in times when they are dealing with cash flow pressures. \u201cCash flow compromised consumers\u201d are 3.5 times more likely to use BNPL than other groups of consumers.\n\nThis week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau called for additional research into BNPL after finding that BNPL borrowers carried higher balances on other credit lines. More than one-fifth of consumers with a credit report used BNPL loans in 2022, while more than 60% of BNPL users had simultaneous BNPL loans.\n\nThe CFPB also found that nearly two-thirds of BNPL loans went to consumers with subprime \u2014 or lower \u2014 credit scores, and BNPL borrowers had higher balances on other credit lines such as personal loans, retail loans, student loans, credit cards and subprime alternative financial services lenders.",

            "content": "As the physical and digital experiences continue to converge, we\u2019re taking the tap beyond physical checkout. With our Tap to More set of contactless modalities, we can make digital commerce even faster, safer and simpler, from instantly provisioning a card into a mobile wallet to verifying a transaction to sending money to friends and family, all with just a tap.\n\nWe\u2019ve already harnessed contactless technology to make it simple for merchants to accept payments through their own smartphones. Our Tap on Phone capabilities, now live in more than 110 markets, empower micro-merchants who need flexible and low-cost acceptance options, offer queue-busting solutions for large retailers, and allow people to tap for purchases in flight on major airlines. In addition to enabling Tap on Phone solutions with our partners, Mastercard\u2019s own Tap on Phone solution, called Cloud Commerce , moves key functionalities to the cloud, helping our partners deploy these capabilities at scale, including most recently with FOMO Pay in Singapore .\n\nContactless now represents more than two of every three in-person transactions on the Mastercard network. It\u2019s muscle memory. It\u2019s a reflex that is propelling fast and secure consumer experiences and, more broadly, the digitization of payments. And it is capable of so much more.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the speed of contactless transactions \u2014 it\u2019s the speed of adoption. The origin of the technology that enables tap and go dates back to World War II , and it\u2019s been three decades since what is believed to be the first contactless payment was made via a prepaid card for a ride on a city bus in Seoul. While parts of the world embraced contactless as the default more quickly than others, contactless payments truly accelerated in the late 2010s as global transit agencies embraced tap to ride , digital wallets became ubiquitous and touch-free transactions became a necessity during the pandemic.\n\nIt\u2019s a reflex that is propelling fast and secure consumer experiences and, more broadly, the digitization of payments. And it is capable of so much more.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the card information itself. With Tap to Add\u200b, you can tap your card on your phone to provision it into your mobile wallet or store it on file with a merchant\u2019s app or e-commerce wallet. This is enabled by MDES, Mastercard\u2019s tokenization service, which enhances security by converting physical card numbers to verified tokens and binds them to a cryptogram, keeping credentials safe even if compromised. Tap to Activate eliminates the need for calling your bank or going to an ATM to activate your new or reissued card.\n\nDuring an e-commerce transaction, Tap to Verify confirms you\u2019re in possession of your card when using your mobile wallet, bank app or merchant app, delivering more peace of mind without any added friction, like checking your messages or email for a one-time passcode.\n\nThe ease of tapping in store can be replicated in e-commerce through Tap to Pay. If you\u2019re shopping online, you can tap your card against your phone to complete your transaction, without having to type in your card information, and you can also save your card on file for future purchases. It\u2019s another step toward Mastercard\u2019s vision to phase out manual card entry online by 2030.\n\nWith Tap to Send or Receive, you can simply tap your card or mobile phone against someone else\u2019s to complete the transaction for peer-to-peer payment \u2014 no need to search for their handle or type in their name. This is powered by our Mastercard Send platform, which enables near real-time transfers without the multistep process of entering account information, providing routing numbers and validating credentials.\n\nThe industry is taking notice. Tap to Provision capabilities powered by MDES are live across more than 40 markets around the world. Tap to Verify has been launched with Stripe in the U.S., and Tap to Pay is being piloted with Ingresse in Brazil and OpenRice in Hong Kong.\n\nAnd this is just the start. The speed of contactless adoption could not have occurred without trust in the tap. That trust can enhance our ability to manage and exchange anything of value, from money to identity credentials to medical data, by turning taps into verified tokens. That unlocks more ways to tap on any type of connected device \u2014 from smart mirrors in stores to connected cars on the go.\n\nImagine a token economy imbued with the highest level of security and personal control over payments and data. That\u2019s tapping into the future.",

And for consumers, instant payments do away with the frustration of waiting days for funds to clear. As real-time payment networks grow and interconnect, they will likely turn into one of the default modes for cross-border transactions.\n\nIn the end, as PYMNTS\u2019 Karen Webster noted in an interview posted last fall, any focus on cross-border innovation needs to be honed in on solving key frictions: moving money securely and safely, delivering transparency and optimizing the economics of cross-border transactions.",

(Image from Shutterstock)\n\nMastercard has agreed to pay $26 million to settle a proposed class action lawsuit accusing the company of paying female, Black and Hispanic employees less than their male and white counterparts.\n\nAccording to a Jan. 14 court filing in New York, Mastercard said it also would conduct annual pay equity audits for three years and hire a psychologist to assess its career framework and processes, the New York Times reports. The company did not admit to wrongdoing.\n\nBloomberg Law, Reuters and the New York Times have coverage.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case are former Mastercard employees who allege that the company\u2019s compensation, promotion and assignment practices negatively affect female, Black and Hispanic employees, according to the settlement memorandum filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, plaintiffs allege that Mastercard has treated female, Black and Hispanic employees less favorably than similarly situated white and male comparators with respect to pay, leveling and promotion, even though they held equivalent positions and, upon information and belief, performed the same or substantially similar work,\u201d according to the settlement memorandum.\n\nIf approved, the settlement will resolve claims that Mastercard underpaid about 7,500 employees across the country dating as far back as 2016.\n\nMastercard agreed to the settlement before the proposed class action complaint was filed in federal court Tuesday, according to a Jan. 14 press release from Outten & Golden, the law firm that represents the plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased to have reached this nationwide settlement with Mastercard, which we believe represents a fair compromise,\u201d said Cara E. Greene, a partner at the firm and lead counsel for the plaintiffs, in the release. \u201cImportantly, the nonmonetary terms of the settlement will help ensure that Mastercard maintains an equitable workplace for the thousands of women and people of color it employs. Settlements like this help to level the playing field and move the entire industry closer to pay equity.\u201d\n\nSeth Eisen, a spokesperson for Mastercard, told the New York Times that the company \u201cstrongly\u201d denies the allegations but agreed to settle the case to demonstrate its commitment to supporting and delivering for its employees.\n\n\u201cIt is in the best interest of all involved to bring this matter to a close,\u201d Eisen said.",

            "content": "Mastercard is strategically positioned to tap into emerging growth opportunities, leveraging its strong cash reserves to drive both organic expansion and strategic acquisitions. The company's investments and global partnerships reflect its commitment to broadening its network and sustaining its leadership in the payment industry. These efforts have notably contributed to its cross-border volume growth.\n\nMastercard's digital strategy and expansion in emerging markets like Southeast Asia and Latin America further support its long-term growth potential. These efforts are particularly significant in offsetting the revenue gap left by its withdrawal from Russia. With many underbanked populations in these regions, Mastercard is well-positioned to capitalize on untapped opportunities and strengthen its global presence.\n\nMastercard reported notable year-over-year growth in its Domestic Assessments, Cross-Border Assessments and Transaction Processing Assessments during the first nine months of 2024. Additionally, its Value-Added Services and Solutions segment showcased strong growth, reflecting the success of its diversification strategy.\n\nMastercard continues to deliver robust growth in processed transactions and gross dollar volume, serving as key drivers of its revenue expansion. In 2022, 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, processed transactions grew 12.1%, 13.9% and 11.5%, respectively, while gross dollar volumeincreased 6%, 10.3% and 7.8% year over year.\n\nOver the past year, Mastercard's stock has gained 18.9%, aligning with the industry average. It outpaced Visa's 16.6% gain but lagged behind American Express' impressive 66% surge and the S&P 500 Index\u2019s broader 23.6% return. These results highlight Mastercard's steady, albeit not market-leading, performance.\n\nHowever, such a high valuation warrants a closer examination of Mastercard's performance, operations, growth potential and market conditions. Careful analysis is crucial to determine whether this premium is justified or if waiting for a more attractive entry point might be wiser.\n\nPayments-processing giant Mastercard Incorporated MA is currently trading at a premium valuation. Its forward earnings multiple of 31.07X significantly exceeds the financial transaction industry average of 24.01X. In comparison, competitors like Visa Inc. V and American Express Company AXP trade at more modest forward P/E ratios of 26.55X and 19.61X, respectively. This premium reflects the market's confidence in Mastercard's growth potential.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThanks to its cash-generating abilities and balance sheet strength, it announced a new share buyback program of $12 billion last month, which will become effective after completing its previously announced $11 billion program. It also announced a 15.2% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to 76 cents per share from 66 cents paid out earlier.\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on cutting-edge technology further solidifies its position in the rapidly evolving financial ecosystem. By prioritizing cybersecurity and data analytics, Mastercard aligns itself with the increasing global demand for secure and efficient digital solutions.\n\nAs economies continue their shift toward digital transactions, Mastercard is well-prepared to harness this trend. The decline of traditional payment methods and the surge in digital payments provide a fertile landscape for the company to leverage its global network and expand its value-added services business.\n\nEncouraging Estimates for MA\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mastercard\u2019s 2024 and 2025 EPS implies an 18% and 12.4% uptick, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The earnings estimates remained stable over the past month. Also, the consensus mark for 2024 and 2025 revenues suggests an 11.8% and 12.2% increase, respectively.\n\nThe company beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average of 3.2%. This is depicted in the figure below.\n\nMastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMastercard Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Mastercard Incorporated Quote\n\nMA\u2019s Challenges\n\nDespite its strong position, Mastercard faces several headwinds:\n\nAdjusted operating expenses have been on an upward trend, growing 10.7% in 2022, 10.5% in 2023, and 9.9% during the first nine months of 2024. Additionally, increasing rebates and incentives \u2014 a contra-revenue item \u2014 are likely to weigh on net revenue growth. In the third quarter of 2024 alone, this metric rose 17% year over year due to new and renewed deals.\n\nMastercard recently reached an agreement to settle a collective London lawsuit related to card fees, which was brought on behalf of British consumers. Per reports, the company also settled a pay bias lawsuit, agreeing to hire consultants to audit pay practices and an industrial psychologist to evaluate its \u201ccareer ecosystem.\u201d These lawsuits and settlements add to its costs and may impact reputation management.\n\nThe Credit Card Competition Act of 2023, designed to increase competition and lower merchant costs in the U.S. market, poses a significant risk. If passed, it could disrupt Mastercard\u2019s and Visa\u2019s current dominance outside of the Eastern Hemisphere, where UnionPay leads. This legislation could slow growth in the United States, where both companies maintain a duopoly.\n\nThe potential impact of shifting political dynamics in the payments space will likely become clearer in the coming weeks as the President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\nConclusion: Hold MA Stock for Now\n\nFor current investors, Mastercard\u2019s robust cash position, operational resilience and growth prospects make it a strong hold. However, for potential buyers, exercising patience may be wise. The stock\u2019s premium valuation, rising costs and regulatory challenges warrant caution, especially as it trades just 5.3% below its 52-week high of $537.70, offering limited upside in the near term. Monitoring the consumer spending environment and Mastercard\u2019s upcoming earnings report later this month could provide clearer signals for future investment decisions.\n\nMastercard currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reflecting a neutral outlook.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nAccording to the Financial Industry Index, which increased by more than 30% by mid-December and beat the overall market by about 5 percentage points, 2024 was a spectacular year for the financial industry. This growth followed concerns about mid-sized bank collapses in early 2024, which proved to be isolated incidents rather than an issue impacting the industry as a whole.\n\nMeanwhile, as we have mentioned in our article, 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds, the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years.\n\nAmidst the growth, as per EY\u2019s report, the financial services industry is also undergoing a change because of artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, which boosts productivity, modifications, and innovation. AI is helping banks provide individual solutions and improve risk control while accelerating processes like fraud detection, loan processing, and customer support. Large financial institutions are using AI to lower expenses, improve compliance, and create new products like automated tax compliance and predictive analytics. Nonetheless, issues like data privacy, rules of conduct, and AI\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d decision-making continue to exist. Notwithstanding these obstacles, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing financial services by spreading beyond banking to include wealth management, insurance, and payments.\n\nAccording to IBM\u2019s report 2024, Generative AI is revolutionizing financial services by improving customer satisfaction and propelling advancements in risk assessment as well as personalized financial solutions. Secondly, the use of hybrid clouds is growing as companies seek to boost compliance, scalability, and efficiency. Thirdly, cybersecurity is still crucial, with growing investment in fraud detection systems as AI-driven threats emerge. Businesses are putting a greater spotlight on sustainability by giving green financial products and ESG initiatives top priority. By utilizing AI technologies such as Watsonx Assistant, customer experience management (CXM) increases customer pleasure and loyalty. Moreover, the use of open banking is growing as a result of APIs\u2019 ability to simplify procedures and provide customers with more control over their data. Secure online transactions are being reinforced by the resurgence of digital currencies and blockchain.\n\nLooking ahead, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 investment management outlook predicts that AI, digital transformation, and changing investor demands will quickly impact the investment management industry in 2025. Low-cost funds are dominant, with active management flourishing within ETFs. Sustainability-focused investments, hybrid funds, and private financing are important growth areas. AI has exceeded expectations and is transforming operations and sales, but companies that are not embracing it quickly could fall behind. Regulatory changes, cybersecurity, and the combination of traditional and alternative assets are examples of growing risks. While some companies may find it difficult to survive in a high-risk, high-reward environment, bold companies that use AI and diversify their products may benefit from these changes. The key to success is scaling innovation and satisfying the need for sustainable, affordable solutions.\n\nOn the other hand, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report stated that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. It is anticipated that GDP growth will be 1.5% in 2025, and inflation will be approaching the 2% target, presenting a low-growth, lower-rate scenario for US banks. With savings exhausted by March 2024 and debt reaching $17.7 trillion, consumer spending may decline. Net interest margins may be compressed as a result of declining interest rates, with the federal funds rate falling to 350-375 basis points. Noninterest income presents opportunities, but growing salaries and technology expenditures drive up costs. Credit quality may slightly improve but is expected to stabilize. As geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty further complicate the picture, Deloitte observes that weak business investment and higher deposit costs will test banks\u2019 adaptability.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through holdings of financial ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 financial services stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with a projected upside potential of over 7% based on analyst price targets, as of January 9. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

The company thrives at digital and cross-border payments, maintains strong operating margins, and gains from more travel.

Revenue increased 13% year over year in Q3 of 2024 due to strong consumer spending and improved global macroeconomic conditions. Travel-related and overall spending is still growing, as seen by the 10% YoY growth in gross dollar volume and the 17% YoY increase in cross-border volumes. Operating margins rose to 59.3%, which led to a 16% increase in EPS, while revenue from value-added services grew by 18%, surpassing overall growth. The company\u2019s $12 billion authorization for a new share buyback and its $12 billion yearly free cash flow prove that it continues to deliver outstanding returns to shareholders. Cash flow from operations grew by 58.86% year over year.\n\nTrevor Williams, a Jefferies analyst, maintained his Buy recommendation on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) shares and increased the price objective from $590 to $610. Investors are informed by the analyst that, based on the firm\u2019s assessment of the underlying drivers in FY25, no more pricing would be required in 2025 for the company to achieve 12% growth in organic transaction processing fees, and just 50 points of additional pricing would be required to achieve 13% growth.\n\nThe 24 analysts with 12-month price targets for Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stock have an average target of $567.17, with a low estimate of $482 and a high estimate of $654. The current stock price of $516.40 is expected to rise 9.83%, according to the average objective.\n\nKen Griffin\u2019s Citadel Investment Group was the largest stakeholder in the firm among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database. It owns 4.12 million shares worth $2.03 billion as of Q3. Qualivian Investment Partners stated the following regarding Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA): Q2 2024 revenues and EPS beat consensus expectations, growing 11% (+13% on a constant currency, CC, basis) and 24% (+27% on a CC basis) respectively. Overall payments volume increased 9%, with highly profitable cross-border volumes growing 17%. Management qualified their expectations for a solid FY2024 anchored around continued stable consumer spending, while noting there is uncertainty regarding the overall macroeconomic backdrop heading into the back half of 2024 and 2025. In the event of a weakening consumer, management noted they would adjust investment priorities as well as the company\u2019s cost structure as appropriate if trends softened further. We continue to expect that over the longer term, MA will continue to drive and benefit from the digitization of payments globally.\u201d\n\nOverall, MA ranks 7th on our list of the best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential for MA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

It provides a full Admirals Club membership, as well as several other benefits that make flying American Airlines more enjoyable. These include a free checked bag, priority check-in, airport screening and boarding privileges and a boost toward elite status. Card Rating*: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n*Card rating is based on the opinion of TPG's editors and is not influenced by the card issuer.\n\nWhile many credit cards offer airport lounge access, the types of lounges each card gets you into can vary greatly. There's only one cobranded credit card that includes complimentary access to the American Airlines Admirals Club lounges: the Citi / AAdvantage Executive World Elite Mastercard.\n\nThe card's annual fee is $595, which might seem steep but is still much less expensive than an Admirals Club membership (currently $850 for new members).\n\nTo be approved for the card, a credit score of 670 or higher is recommended.\n\nThis card underwent major (mostly negative) changes in mid-2023, and TPG senior editorial director Nick Ewen wasn't thrilled with them.\n\nLet's review all the benefits of this American Airlines cobranded card to help you decide whether to carry \u2014 or keep \u2014 it in your wallet.\n\nCiti / AAdvantage Executive World Elite pros and cons\n\nPros Cons Admirals Club membership\n\nLoyalty Point bonus during status qualification year based on earning\n\nStatement credits for ride-hailing, Grubhub and car rental High annual fee\n\nNo free authorized users\n\nCiti / AAdvantage Executive World Elite welcome offer\n\nNew Citi / AAdvantage Executive World Elite Mastercard cardholders can earn 70,000 bonus miles after spending $7,000 within the first three months of account opening. This bonus is worth $1,155, based on TPG's January 2025 valuations.\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\n\nThe highest offer we've seen on this card in the past is 100,000 bonus miles. It's impossible to say if we'll see an offer this high again, but it's likely that we'll see an elevated welcome bonus at some point in the future.\n\nDaily Newsletter Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter Join over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG\u2019s experts Email address Sign up By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy .

The primary cardholder receives a full Admirals Club membership, which allows them and their immediate family or two traveling companions access to the club when they have a same-day boarding pass for American or one of its partners.\n\nThis credit card will be tied to a cardholder's AAdvantage account number, so there's no need to carry it to get club access.\n\nAdmirals Club membership ordinarily costs between $700 and $850, depending on your status level with American. That means the annual fee covers the lounge access \u2014 without all the other benefits factored in.\n\nAmerican Airlines B-concourse Admirals Club at Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT). SEAN CUDAHY/THE POINTS GUY\n\nYou can add up to 10 authorized users. They cost an additional $175 annual fee for the first three authorized users and $175 for each authorized user thereafter. Each authorized user receives Admirals Club access for themselves and up to two traveling companions. Just be aware that authorized users only get Admirals Club access, as opposed to a full Admirals Club membership.\n\nThere are three statement credits available:\n\nUp to $120 back on eligible Avis or Budget car rentals every calendar year (this credit was restricted in July 2024)\n\nUp to $120 back on eligible Grubhub purchases every 12 billing statements (up to a $10 statement credit on each monthly billing statement)\n\nUp to $120 in Lyft credits annually ($10 Lyft credit each month), but you have to take three eligible rides each month first to receive this credit\n\nHere are some other valuable perks the card offers:\n\nEnhanced airport experience: You and up to eight travelers on the same reservation will get priority check-in (where available), airport screening (where available) and boarding privileges.

Global Entry/TSA PreCheck fee statement credit: Get an up-to-$120 statement credit when paying your Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee with this card. You'll receive the credit once every four years. Because you also receive TSA PreCheck when enrolling for Global Entry, there's no real reason you should ever just enroll in PreCheck.\n\nZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY\n\nThis card removed travel protections a few years back but has reintroduced trip cancellation and interruption, trip delay and lost baggage protections and car rental insurance coverage.\n\nFinally, there are no foreign transaction fees, making this card a good choice when traveling abroad.\n\nEarning miles on the Citi / AAdvantage Executive World Elite\n\nWith the Citi / AAdvantage Executive World Elite Mastercard, you'll earn 4 miles per dollar on eligible American Airlines purchases. Then, if you spend $150,000 on purchases in a calendar year, you'll earn a boosted rate of 5 miles per dollar spent on American purchases for the remainder of the calendar year.\n\nYou'll also earn 10 miles per dollar spent on eligible car rentals and hotels booked through American's car rental and hotel booking sites, respectively.\n\nA Oneworld Alliance-branded American Airlines jet. SEAN CUDAHY/THE POINTS GUY\n\nFinally, you'll earn 1 mile per dollar spent on all other eligible purchases.\n\nCardholders earn a bonus of 10,000 Loyalty Points after reaching 50,000 Loyalty Points in a status qualification year. They receive another bonus of 10,000 Loyalty Points after reaching 90,000 Loyalty Points in the same status qualification year.\n\nYou will receive the bonuses regardless of how you earn the Loyalty Points. For example, you could earn 50,000 Loyalty Points by buying American Airlines tickets and shopping through the AAdvantage portal and get the 10,000 bonus points just by holding the card.\n\nRedeeming miles on the Citi / AAdvantage Executive World Elite\n\nThe lowest round-trip tickets in the U.S. tend to start at 7,500 miles one-way for flights less than 500 miles long.\n\nWeb specials previously offered include domestic cross-country flights for 5,000 miles each way in economy or 15,000 miles each way in first class, flights to Europe from 9,000 miles each way and flights to Brazil from 15,000 miles each way.\n\nAlternatively, you could get a ton of value by redeeming your AAdvantage miles for premium-cabin awards on partner airlines, including Cathay Pacific, Etihad and Qatar Airways.\n\nERIC ROSEN/THE POINTS GUY\n\nTPG contributing editor Matt Moffitt and TPG credit cards writer Danyal Ahmed's favorite way of redeeming AAdvantage miles is to book business-class flights on Etihad or Qatar Airways to the Middle East, India and Africa.\n\nThe miles you can earn with this card could help you make the vacation of your dreams come true if you know how to redeem them for high value.\n\nWhich cards compete with the Citi / AAdvantage Executive World Elite?\n\nAmerican is not a transfer partner of any of the major points programs, with the exception of Marriott Bonvoy, so the biggest competitors of this card are mostly other cobranded American Airlines cards. That said, you can also get tons of value from a more general premium card.\n\nFor additional options, check out our full list of the best travel cards.\n\nRelated: Choosing the best credit card for American Airlines flyers\n\nThe information for the Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\nBottom line\n\nSince an Admirals Club membership starts at $700 each year, the Citi / AAdvantage Executive World Elite Mastercard should catch the eye of any frequent American Airlines flyer's attention.\n\nIf you want Admirals Club access and to boost your AA mileage balance with a welcome bonus (while also easing elite status requirements), this card provides ongoing value. However, you might want to look elsewhere if you're looking for a card that will give you a better return on your spending.\n\nApply here: Citi / AAdvantage Executive World Elite Mastercard",

Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.52%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.23%.\n\nThe processor of debit and credit card payments's shares have seen a decrease of 4.79% over the last month, surpassing the Business Services sector's loss of 6.13% and falling behind the S&P 500's loss of 3.45%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of MasterCard will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on January 30, 2025. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $3.68, indicating a 15.72% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $7.39 billion, indicating a 12.83% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for MasterCard. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988.

            "content": "Shelby McFaddin, an investment analyst at Motley Fool Asset Management, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our \u201cSmart Investing\u201d video series.\n\nWatch the interview above and check out the transcript below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nANDY MILLS (AM): Motley Fool Asset Management\u2019s Efficiency 100 Index includes companies like Netflix, Walmart, and MasterCard. Can you tell me why these companies stand out?\n\nSHELBY MCFADDIN (SM): Yeah, it really gets right down to why we\u2019ve called the product what we have. It\u2019s really what they are doing with their capital and how they\u2019re able to reinvest it, and also get it back to shareholders in a way that protects them from some of these more wobbly markets, if you will. So when we look at Netflix, Walmart (WMT) and MasterCard (MA) , these are all three companies that have pretty strong free cash flow. We trust them in the way that they reinvest in the business, whether that\u2019s gonna be Walmart, which tends to be a little bit more dividend focused, or if it\u2019s going to be continuing to make little acquisitions or starting on different business ventures, we don\u2019t have those sort of concerns that they\u2019re going to be taking a massive hit to the amount of free cash that they\u2019re able to kick back into share value.\n\nAM: Netflix (NFLX) has done a pivot into live sports. How significant is this for their growth and what risks will they face?\n\nSM: It\u2019s definitely early days to see exactly what it\u2019s going to mean for growth, because in this instance, we\u2019re still trying to figure out if their venture into sports is going to make the pie bigger, or if they\u2019re going to have to take pieces of the pie from somewhere else. So it\u2019s early days to see exactly what it\u2019s going to contribute to the top line. But one thing we do know is that it\u2019s going to continue to contribute to competition in the streaming space. And so knowing that Netflix has really solidified their position in streaming, on the whole they\u2019re in good shape. They\u2019re not a new company with a new venture, they\u2019re a pretty mature company with a new venture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other thing is it in theory should create an appetite for other sports to want to get more viewers. So sports that wouldn\u2019t traditionally be broadcasting or maybe it\u2019s kind of something that you have to just go on a website, it\u2019s not yet available on any sort of traditional broadcast channel. It encourages them to make the sport something that people want to watch, because now there are outlets that will be competing for subscribers and that is more viewers. So in theory it should do some market making that then allows them to pick up more of that market.\n\nAM: Another pick is Walmart. What sets them apart from their competitors?\n\nSM: It\u2019s really the age-old truth of value when it comes to Walmart. They have continued to pick up the upper income consumer. They actually just announced a new brand refresh. Now, when I looked at the two, I didn\u2019t see huge difference, but I trust that their marketing team believes that this is going to add a lot of value. And really what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re making sure that Americans have what they need, but that they can also get a little bit of what they want. They\u2019re lowering prices when they\u2019re able to and just making things as accessible as possible in a more inflationary environment. Now, the shares are a bit rich in our purview, but we do not have concerns about management. We don\u2019t have concerns about the operator. We don\u2019t have concerns about how they\u2019re expanding their network, the pace at which they\u2019re refreshing their stores. They\u2019re even improving their competition with the Walmart Plus product, so we do feel good about how the company is being run and the value that it\u2019s going to continue to offer to Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAM: I saw the old logo, the new logo, and it looked slightly different. What is that?\n\nSM: My degree is in economics. I\u2019m not good with color theory, but I\u2019m sure they put a few billions into it. Maybe not billions, but they put a good chunk into it. I gotta trust that they know what they\u2019re doing there.\n\nAM: In your notes, you mentioned Mastercard\u2019s insulation from inflation due to its role in payment infrastructure. How might economic turbulence impact its performance?\n\nSM: When we think about Mastercard, some of the main things I\u2019m looking at every quarter are going to be their gross dollar volume, but I\u2019m also looking at the switch transactions. And when we think about gross dollar volume, how much are people spending? At the end of the day, they\u2019re not sort of assessing their fees on the real dollars spent, it\u2019s assessed on the nominal dollars. So as things get more expensive, that fee is staying this, you know, if it\u2019s a percentage, it\u2019s going to be the same. So if one product costs more, then that\u2019s just going to continue to be more income.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, when we also think about the amount of transactions that are passing through the rails, if we think of the same thing as like a ticket \u2014 which would be how much you spent that day versus how many times you went in \u2014 a lot of transactions are being expanded into multiples. So one transaction of a hundred dollars is now four with things like \u201cbuy now, pay later.\u201d So if you are entering in your debit card or your credit card, it\u2019s getting passed over the rails four times for one product, so it\u2019s going ahead and increasing the amount of transactions that they\u2019re seeing. And that\u2019s similar for some of their competitors. When we think about an inflationary environment, we realize that yes, things cost a bit more, but we\u2019re also realizing that people still have to buy them and that they\u2019re not necessarily going to go back to cash just because things are expensive. So it\u2019s not a complete insulation. You can go back and look at the great financial crisis and see that they do move up and down with the market, but they tend to get a little bit more cushion.\n\nAM: And there is that period of time when consumers are going more to credit cards because of the environment.\n\nSM: And that\u2019s going to be more lucrative: Payment networks choosing credit cards over debit cards. Now, there could be credit card regulation, way too early to tell, just far too early. We have an administration change coming. We\u2019re not sure how that\u2019s going to go, but there\u2019s been talk about that for years. Unsure. But again, Mastercard, we trust them as operators. They have a really great system set up, so we would not expect them to be any less prepared than anyone else that would be facing the exact same regulations.",

This year, more companies are looking beyond generative AI to agentic AI: models that use sophisticated reasoning to solve complex, multi-step problems that current chatbots typically can\u2019t.\n\nIn his keynote speech, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the movement to agentic AI \u201cone of the most important things happening in enterprise.\u201d In addition to building the hardware that makes these next-gen models possible, Nvidia also developed AI Blueprints, frameworks for developers to build and deploy custom AI agents.\n\nThe company worked with several partners to create five Blueprints, including a video analysis AI agent that can search for relevant information in video archives and create summary reports of videos. Justin Boitano, Nvidia\u2019s vice president of enterprise AI, said in a blog post that the Blueprints \u201cprovide the building blocks for developers to create the next wave of AI applications that will transform every industry.\u201d\n\nAnother interesting nugget from Huang\u2019s keynote was the exploration of \u201ctest-time scaling\u201d \u2014 an agentic AI model\u2019s capability of determining how much computing power to devote to a given task. When dealing with complex, multi-step decision-making, knowing when to think harder and calculate longer (and when the results may not justify the effort) could be a game-changer in terms of efficiency.\n\n02\n\nHomes, vehicles and cities get smarter and more connected than ever\n\nOne of the Samsung appliances that earned a CES Innovation Award \u2014 its 4-Door Refrigerator with AI Home and AI Vision Inside 2.0 \u2014 broke free of the home appliance label to be recognized in the AI category. The AI fridge recognizes and tracks food going in and out of it, alerts owners before items expire and manages grocery lists when essentials run low.\n\nFor those who find themselves trying to figure out dinner as they drive home from work, SoundHound debuted the first ever \u201cin-car voice commerce ecosystem.\u201d The platform makes it seamless and completely hands-free to find nearby restaurants, place and pay for your order, and navigate to pick up your meal, all using your voice through your car\u2019s infotainment system.\n\nFood orders are just part of the emerging in-car commerce experience. A panel called \u201cVehicle Payments \u2013 The Road Ahead\u201d discussed the potential of using digital payments to allow someone to pay for parking or an event ticket \u2014 all without drivers taking their hands off the wheel or eyes off the road.\n\nFor those with their sights set on grand-scale smart tech, Toyota provided an update on its futuristic smart city, dubbed \u201cWoven City,\u201d to reflect its three-part network of roadways for pedestrians, high-speed vehicles and lower-speed personal transportation.",

Except it won\u2019t be called that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer about search engine optimization. It\u2019s about answer engines,\u201d said Digitas CEO Amy Lanzi.\n\nInstead of sorting out how to show up highly in Google\u2019s search rankings, brands are going to need to determine how to appeal to the AI agents that are expected to handle tasks for people like booking travel itineraries. \u201cBrands need to be the answer to the questions you\u2019re asking in Gemini or whatever [other generative AI tool],\u201d said Lanzi.\n\nThis notion of answer engine optimization \u2014 or agentic AI optimization, or whatever it ends up being called \u2014 has been a major topic of discussion among agency executives during this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show.\n\n\u201cThe reality of AI agents gathering information and bringing it back [to people], that is search in 2025 and beyond. Making sure you are there from an SEO perspective is absolutely vital,\u201d said Kelly Metz, chief investment officer at OMD USA.\n\nHow marketers make sure their brands are picked when someone asks an AI agent to plan their summer vacation or handle their Christmas shopping goes way beyond traditional SEO tactics, though.\n\n\u201cSearch has been the answer to discoverability. Now it will be an ingredient and a different paradigm,\u201d said Jeff Geheb, global chief experience officer and global lead for enterprise solutions at VML.\n\nSEO tactics historically have centered around tying a brand to specific keywords by seeding content around the web that makes that connection so that Google\u2019s search engine learns to make that association when someone types one of those keywords into a search query. Keyword-based tactics aren\u2019t going to cut it when the large language models powering AI agents can beyond recognizing keywords to understand the context and concepts underlying language to judge for themselves what is the best [insert product type] rather than rely on publishers\u2019 articles listing the best [insert product type].\n\n\u201cThe reality of the AI agents is they\u2019re going to your website to bring information to users. Navigating that is challenging for brands. It\u2019s questions like, \u2018Do I want them to go to my site? How do I leverage partnerships in media to get more out of this experience to ensure I\u2019m showing up in the right ways with the agents,\u2019\u201d said Metz.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about \u2018store near me.\u2019 It\u2019s about \u2018perfect place to make me beautiful\u2019 because I want to win \u2018best brand to buy makeup from,\u2019\u201d said Lanzi. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different way to think about winning in search. That\u2019s why Reddit is interesting.\u201d\n\nWith Reddit\u2019s deal with Google to make the platform\u2019s user data available to the latter\u2019s LLM, what people say about brands on Reddit \u2014 in the colorful language that people use on the platform \u2014 can color AI agents\u2019 assessments as much as, if not more than, a brand\u2019s own content pages as well as any publisher articles.\n\nBut Reddit is just one example of the broader challenge. As LLMs ingest content across the web and beyond, marketers will have a harder time trying to curate, let alone control, what information about their brands and products is exposed to LLMs.\n\nAt the same time, brands are likely to develop their own AI agents, which may end up interacting with the AI agents used by people and being centerpieces to whatever this new SEO is called.\n\n\u201cThe moniker we\u2019re moving into is M-to-M: machine to machine,\u201d said Brian Yamada, chief innovation officer at VML. \u201cIn this next era, which will start to get scale, we\u2019ll have our agents talk to consumer agents. Then brands will have to think about brand APIs, what datasets to make available. Agents are going to decide what the experience layer is.\u201d\n\nThat experience layer being, well, reality.\n\n3 Questions with Mastercard\u2019s Raja Rajamannar\n\nHow brands pay agencies for their work seems set to change as AI tools undermine the billable hours model. What exactly the new agency compensation model(s) will be is anyone\u2019s guess. But some guesses carry more weight than others. Like those coming from CMOs. So Digiday sat down with Mastercard\u2019s chief marketing and communications officer Raja Rajamannar during CES to get his take on the matter.\n\nThe transcript has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on how the agency compensation model needs to change?\n\nI\u2019ll give you a small anecdote, and then I\u2019ll tell you why I\u2019m saying what I\u2019m saying, At Mastercard, we keep receiving RFPs from our clients, our prospects. In the past, it used to take about seven weeks from the time of receiving the RFP to write the first draft response. Seven weeks. Today it takes less than one day, including human oversight. There is no increase in manpower; it\u2019s the brilliance of AI that is making this process ridiculously efficient without sacrificing quality.\n\nSo one of the things I am challenging my own team is saying that, if there are efficiencies in our ecosystem, whether in our own team or with our partners, which is agencies, we need to challenge the existing model. There is a significant efficiency opportunity available. And I think agencies have to reinvent the model.\n\nHow would you like to see that change? Because the whole idea of billable hours is completely different in a world where AI tools cut down the time it takes to complete client projects.\n\nIf I were to go to billable hours as the way, it\u2019s going to be brutal for the agencies, and we should not drive agencies to extinction. There has to be a different model.\n\nIt could be a project model. For this project, to get the output I will give you so much. Or it could be a combination of [the agency] will dedicate three [full-time employees] to [the brand] and those three FTEs [the brand] will pay completely, and here is the amount of tokens that that we are using for AI. So cost-plus could be a second model.\n\nThe third [model type] is outcome-based remuneration. If I say I am trying to accomplish awareness and preference for my new service or product from X to Y, I will pay you ABC dollars for that. Now you as the agency, you figure out how the hell you\u2019re going to make it happen, and I am willing to pay per point, say, $100,000. If you [as the agency] manage to get that increase [at a cost to the agency of] $5,000 and you pocket $95,000, God bless you. But I am looking at it from my perspective: what is each percentage worth to me?\n\nHave you pitched this to your agencies?\n\nNot yet. This is all a work in progress. We ourselves are discovering AI. I need to have enough amount of information and knowledge and experience to be able to say, \u201cYou know what? I know that the job you are doing will only cost you so much. I can demand that they have it reduced by 70% or 80% or whatever it is, but that\u2019s not going to be helpful to you. I know it\u2019ll drive you out of business. So let\u2019s go to outcomes-based compensation.\u201d\n\nDotdash Meredith\u2019s OpenAI ad assist\n\nDotdash Meredith\u2019s arrangement with OpenAI extends beyond content licensing. The IAC-owned publisher is also using the ChatGPT parent\u2019s AI technology to enhance its contextual advertising product, D/Cipher.\n\nBut first, some background. D/Cipher effectively indexes DDM publications\u2019 article pages by content-related topics so that an advertiser looking to reach brides can target that audience by running ads on articles of interest to brides, which can include wedding-related articles as well as stories on other topics that the brides audience over-indexes on reading. When DDM introduced D/Cipher in 2023, this indexing process used natural language processing to identify common keywords. But in the second half of last year, OpenAI\u2019s large-language model entered the mix.\n\nDDM is now taking advantage of OpenAI\u2019s API to have the LLM find connections among the publisher\u2019s article corpus in a similar way to how ChatGPT is able to process text to understand the underlying concepts of what is written, not just the words on a surface level.\n\n\u201cThe new world of OpenAI significantly improves that because we\u2019re not just talking about words as tokens but as concepts, as conceptual structures. It\u2019s making connection on concepts, not just on the actual language itself,\u201d said Jon Roberts, chief innovation officer at DDM, in an interview.\n\nAfter running DDM\u2019s content library through OpenAI\u2019s technology, 70% of the content connections identified by the LLM were \u201cpretty much the same, but 30% were meaningfully different. It was obviously better,\u201d said Roberts.\n\nAnd to be clear, this isn\u2019t theoretical. \u201dWe have campaigns that are live where those types of insights from that level of the taxonomy are improving the results for advertisers,\u201d said Lindsay Van Kirk, gm of D/Cipher.\n\nCase in point: DDM ran a campaign for a large CPG advertiser that was introducing a new luxury haircare product. One of the audiences that the advertiser wanted to reach was brides. DDM ran the campaign through D/Cipher and was able to see that the campaign underperformed the client-provided core benchmark when brides were included.\n\n\u201cOn that benchmark user engagement, brides were 30% to 40% less likely to engage than the average people looking at the ad,\u201d said Roberts.\n\nDDM was able to detect this specific audience drop-off because the campaign was running on wedding-related content as well as unrelated content where the only audience overlap were those people checking out the wedding-related pieces. DDM recommended removing brides from the campaign, and as a result, the campaign \u201coutperformed [the client\u2019s higher] stretch benchmark,\u201d Van Kirk said.",

            "content": "From car insurance to candy, and books to booking vacations, we spend increasing amounts of time and money on the internet. But the risks associated with transacting more and more of our lives in the digital world are escalating. The FBI says internet scams cost people in the United States $12.5 billion in 2023, and in the UK, fraudsters committed a crime roughly every 11 seconds\u2014that\u2019s nearly 3 million incidents of fraud in just one the year, according to UK Finance.\n\nHelp is at hand, though: Tackling the rising wave of financial crime, Mastercard is fighting scams using advanced AI technologies.\n\nThe company is fighting fire with fire. Whether it\u2019s a romance scam or a too-good-to-be-true online deal designed to part you from your cash, fraudsters are harnessing AI to deceive their victims. Authorized Push Payment (APP) fraud is at the forefront of their playbook. It has quickly become the most prevalent financial scam in the UK, costing the economy nearly \u00a3459.7 million ($589 million) in 2023. APP scams involve fraudsters persuading victims to transfer money to accounts they control, often under false pretences.\n\nTo combat the threat, Mastercard developed its AI-powered Consumer Fraud Risk Tool, which analyzes transactions for indicators of fraud, such as discrepancies in payment values, potential money-mule activities, and transaction patterns. The silent AI tool operates in the background, acting as a sentry that provides both the sending bank as well as the receiving bank with the insights they need to intervene before a questionable transaction takes place.\n\nIn 2024 we saw the tech adopted by more financial institutions, totalling 14 banks including TSB. Extrapolating TSB\u2019s savings across the entire UK market, using Mastercard\u2019s Consumer Fraud Risk Tool could prevent nearly \u00a3100 million in scam-related losses annually. \u201cThe primary benefit of the solution is its ability to use powerful AI and facilitate collaboration between banks, while protecting consumer privacy,\u201d says Johan Gerber, Executive Vice President, Security Solutions at Mastercard\u200b.\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment echoed by Nicola Bannister, Director of Customer Support, TSB, who said the tech had helped the company enormously. \u201cSpotting fraudulent payments among millions made every day is like finding a needle in a haystack, with scams becoming ever more complex\u2014so prevention and monitoring tools are key.\u201d\n\nRecent data from 14 of the largest UK banks published by the Payment Systems Regulator showed a 12 percent reduction in the total value of APP scams from \u00a3389m ($520m) to \u00a3341m ($456m) across 2023.\n\nIt\u2019s not just stopping APP fraud where AI can help. Mastercard\u2019s AI systems are helping limit unauthorized fraud, where scammers use stolen information to secrete away money. The company\u2019s Decision Intelligence (DI) technology helps banks evaluate and approve transactions at scale, enhancing fraud detection rates by up to 300 percent in some cases. Blocking a fraudulent transaction attempt can take just 50 milliseconds using the DI system. \u201cScammers are exploiting new technologies, making their deception and impersonation scams increasingly difficult for consumers to recognize,\u201d says Gerber. But Mastercard can utilize those tools, too.",

            "content": "Having spent 33 years at the payments company, the executive vice-president knows a thing or two about longevity. She tells Tim Healey why playing the long game has been crucial for both personal and business growth.\n\nYou\u2019ve spent more than three decades at Mastercard \u2013 you\u2019re now executive vice-president marketing communications, Asia, Pacific, Middle East and Africa and Europe. How did it happen? How did you find marketing and how did you end up where you are now?\n\nI like to talk about Mastercard as my long, lasting relationship. I started at this company 33 years ago, when Mastercard was still an association. Now we are among the top 11 brands across the globe. The company has gone through a total transformation but Mastercard is still my family.\n\nI have spent the majority of my career in marketing because that is my DNA. But for five years, I also had the opportunity to work in the sales environment. This was crucial, because I had the opportunity to manage a P&L and I had the opportunity to really understand our business model.\n\nGoing back into marketing, I brought those business sensibilities with me. For me, returning to marketing with more business experience was a huge benefit.\n\nAnother important factor in my career is that I\u2019ve lived in different parts of Europe: Italy \u2013 where I am from and where I am based now \u2013 but also France, Belgium and the UK. I also had the opportunity to live in Dubai when I was leading marketing communication for Middle East and Africa.\n\nThis level of travel continues to give me a very different perspective. I believe that marketers need to understand different consumers in every part of the world. You can\u2019t do marketing in isolation, so traveling to our different countries is essential.\n\nBea speaking on the value of the Mastercard brand\n\nDigging into Mastercard\u2019s financials and looking at your last available report, net revenue was $25.1bn and your strategy is to grow your core payments network. Your plans are to expand in payments for consumers, business and governments, to extend your services and drive customer value and to embrace new network opportunities such as open banking. What does 2025 look like for you?\n\nMastercard is present in more than 200 countries, with over 3.4 billion cardholders. The beauty of what we do is that we are able to connect more and more individuals and businesses to the digital economy.\n\nSince 2013 we have been able to connect more than 27 million female-led small businesses to the digital economy, 50 million small businesses and we\u2019ve enabled almost 1 billion people to become financially included.\n\nQ3 has been another strong quarter for Mastercard with double-digit growth across the globe. The earnings growth was supported by continued healthy consumer spending and robust cross-border volume growth of 17%. We have a diversified business model but continue to serve our customers, positioning the company well in both the short and long term.\n\nHow is your marketing team structured?\n\nAt Mastercard our marketing and communications sit together. We are two sides of the same coin. Mastercard is a global company with a foothold in almost every market. As a result, we have a global team. In Europe, we have a regional team and the beauty is that we have marketeers \u2013 people that understand the diversity, difference and culture of each country \u2013 in each market.\n\nWhat\u2019s your first memory of a marketing success, one that you were part of, where you felt: \u201cThis is me. This is the role for me.\u201d\n\nWhen I was a child, my dream was to be a CMO of a global company. I have no idea why! My father and mother were entrepreneurs. They had a very different background. So, from an extremely young age, I was always following that dream.\n\nAbout 25 years ago, the company reached a pivotal moment and decided it was time to invest seriously in our brand. We set out to define our approach to communications, and I was part of a small team working to develop what would become our iconic slogan: \u201cPriceless.\u201d I was a junior marketer back then, but being part of that journey has been one of the most fascinating experiences of my career.\n\nThe original phrase was: \u2018There are some things that money can\u2019t buy; for everything else, there\u2019s Mastercard.\u2019 And from that tagline, the concept around \u2018Priceless\u2019 continues to be built out. The term \u2018Priceless\u2019 is no longer just part of an advertising campaign, it\u2019s part of our DNA as a brand. Mastercard is \u2018priceless.\u2019 Being part of that whole mission was when I realized that my dream was coming true and marketing was my home.\n\nThe entire creative idea was created by our partner agency, McCann, in the US. We are still working with McCann today. It has got to be one of the longest lasting permanently running campaigns. And I think we are the only brand that can associate their identity with only one word: \u2018Priceless.\u2019\n\nThe joy of working with \u2018Priceless\u2019 is that even though, at its core, the meaning of the word is consistent in all of our territories, there are so many ways this one word can be interpreted and developed, both locally and internationally.\n\nSome lucky Mastercard holders also have the opportunity to attend the Cannes Film Festival\n\nWhat is the value of creativity in great brand advertising?\n\nCreativity is essential because, without it, you can\u2019t create compelling content. And to be clear, for me, creativity isn\u2019t just about advertising; it\u2019s a mindset. I often refer to two quotes by Albert Einstein. The first is, \u201cCreativity is intelligence having fun.\u201d Marketing is a science. We don\u2019t make decisions based on what we like; we base them on data, numbers and insights that guide us toward the right approach. But as smart, creative individuals, we still add an element of fun.\n\nThis leads me to Einstein\u2019s second quote: \u201cCreativity is seeing what others see and thinking what no one else has ever thought.\u201d I encourage my teams to look ahead, listen to our customers, and strive to do things differently. As a technology company at the forefront of innovation, our marketing communications must also be at the cutting edge.\n\nHow do you rate the value of emotional connection with marketing campaigns?\n\nOur brand\u2019s position is about connecting everyone to priceless possibilities. When it comes to communication, connecting on an emotional level is crucial; there needs to be something that sparks a genuine emotional response.\n\nThis was the journey Mastercard embarked on. We studied our consumers, mapping their most significant passions worldwide. We then revitalized our sponsorship strategy to align with those passions. For me, there\u2019s no better way to capture the hearts and minds of our consumers \u2013 it all comes down to emotion.\n\nThe Venice Film Festival is sponsored by Mastercard\n\nCould you tell us about an initiative that has happened on your watch that you're especially proud of?\n\nAt Mastercard, we provide countless ways for customers to connect with their passions, whether it\u2019s through the Venice or Cannes Film Festival, the Brit Awards, or The Open.\n\nWe also offer unique experiences to be able to enjoy events from an entirely new perspective. For example, as a long-time sponsor of the Uefa Champions League, Mastercard provides exclusive opportunities for children to be mascots during a match. When the teams enter the pitch, young boys and girls run alongside them as mascots, a special moment that Mastercard makes possible.\n\nThis opportunity is a unique asset owned by Mastercard, allowing parents to see their child walk on to the stadium with their favorite team. It\u2019s a moment that captures a raw emotion \u2013 watching your child enter the stadium is truly priceless. It\u2019s just one way we strive to connect people to priceless possibilities.\n\nMastercard offers the opportunity for their customers\u2019children to be mascots at football matches\n\nHow do you go about navigating the plethora of media choices available today, from out-of-home to email or addressable TV, to name but a few \u2013 there\u2019s a tsunami of technology and channels out there. How do you go about surfing this?\n\nI don\u2019t see this as a problem. I see this as an opportunity. Of course, it is making our job more interesting \u2013 and certainly more challenging. But it\u2019s a good challenge.\n\nWhen I started my career, the options to have one-to-one communication with customers were limited. We only had a few ways to talk to customers; press, TV and radio were the main channels we used. I would be communicating hoping that a person on the other side would be listening and remember some fragment of the messaging. Today, we have the ability to engage in one-to-one communication, have consumers reply, participate and generally create more of a conversation with us. This shift means that marketeers have to be smarter and deliver compelling content.\n\nAt Mastercard, we leverage extensive data and analytics. Our digital engine enables us to perform media listening and reach out to customers at the exact moment they\u2019re discussing a particular topic. This allows us to provide the right content at the right time, for the right reasons.\n\nThe ability to have two-way communication with customers, rather than just broadcasting messages, is truly remarkable. It can be tough at times, but it\u2019s one of the most rewarding aspects of what we do.\n\nMastercard have sponsored the Uefa Champions League since 2020\n\nWhat myth about marketing would you most like to bust?\n\nPeople perceive marketing as being just \u201ca fun job.\u201d Whereas I believe that marketing is a science. But on top of the science, we are able to inject fun and creativity.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nWhat advice would you give to your younger self if you could go back in time?\n\nAll my life, I\u2019ve been a perfectionist. I would tell \u2018a young me\u2019 that the world is not perfect and it\u2019s OK. It might be too late for \u2018the young me,\u2019 but it\u2019s definitely not too late for the human being and the leader that I am today.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to propose one question for my next interviewee. They\u2019ll be a senior marketer like you. What would you like to ask them?\n\nI would like to ask them: how are you building your marketing and communication strategy so that it is fully integrated and fully aligned with both your brand and your business growth objectives?\n\nYour question from another senior marketer is this: how can you be sure there is a connection between your marketing activities and sales?\n\nThere are two key components. The first is brand value: Mastercard ranks among the top 11 brands globally and the activities we undertake contribute directly to maintaining and enhancing that value.\n\nThe second component is the impact on revenue. We measure the financial effect of events sponsored by Mastercard and the impact on the local economy to contribute meaningfully to business growth.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you know about marketing, it is:\n\nIt\u2019s the best job in the world.\n\nYou might die tomorrow so make it worth your while. Worth Your While is an independent creative agency helping brands do spectacular stuff people like to talk about. wyw.agency.\n\nTim Healey, is founder and curator of Little Grey Cells Club, the UK\u2019s premier Senior Marketer meet up.",

            "content": "#Technology Mastercard Introduces Crypto Credential for Simplified, Secure Crypto Transactions in EEMEA Mastercard's Crypto Credential simplifies blockchain transactions in UAE and Kazakhstan, enhancing security, trust, and accessibility for regional digital asset users.\n\nMastercard has introduced the latest expansion of its innovative Mastercard Crypto Credential solution to the UAE and Kazakhstan, marking its debut in the Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (EEMEA) region.\n\nMastercard Crypto Credential simplifies the consumer experience allowing crypto exchange users to send and receive cryptocurrencies using simple aliases instead of complex blockchain addresses, facilitated through Mastercard\u2019s partnerships with key exchanges and providers in the region. It also helps verify transactions among consumers and businesses using blockchain networks, providing the assurance that a user has met a set of verification standards and confirming that the recipient\u2019s wallet supports the transferred asset. It brings greater trust and certainty to crypto transactions through the exchange of metadata and Travel Rule information.\n\nThis latest expansion will enable exchanges such as ATAIX Eurasia, Intebix, and CoinMENA, as well as Fuze, one of the leading Digital Asset Infrastructure providers, to simplify and secure blockchain transactions for users in the region.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency landscape continues to mature, we\u2019ve been laser focused on developing innovative services and capabilities that help make crypto more accessible and secure, streamline the transaction process and enhance trust in the ecosystem. In bringing Mastercard Crypto Credential to the EEMEA region, we\u2019re delivering on our vision to increase and instill trust in blockchain technology while also transforming the way that people interact with digital assets. \u2013 Gaurang Shah, Executive Vice President, Head of Core Payments, EEMEA, Mastercard\n\nUsing Mastercard Crypto Credential is simple. The exchange first verifies the user under the set of Mastercard Crypto Credential standards. At that point, the user obtains an alias to send and receive funds across all supported exchanges. When a user initiates a transfer, the solution confirms that the recipient\u2019s alias is valid, and that the recipient\u2019s wallet supports the digital asset and associated blockchain. If this is not the case, the sender is notified, and the transaction does not proceed, protecting all parties from potential loss of funds.\n\nWhile the pilot will initially focus on facilitating peer-to-peer transactions, the potential applications of Crypto Credential are expansive, with future capabilities to include NFTs, ticketing, and other innovative payment solutions, depending on market and compliance requirements.\n\nThe UAE and Kazakhstan are joining previously activated markets in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific where users can send cross-border and domestic digital asset transfers within and between the regions across multiple blockchains and assets. A select group of crypto wallet users will leverage Mastercard Crypto Credential on a first-come, first-serve basis. Wider availability will roll out across the participating exchanges over the coming months.\n\nWe are committed to fostering innovation in the digital asset space while ensuring a secure, transparent environment for all market participants. By providing clear regulatory frameworks, we aim to build trust and confidence. Collaboration with global partners like Mastercard is key to establishing consistent standards, ensuring the long-term growth and integrity of the sector. \u2013 Yagub Zamanov, FinTech Division Director, Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA)\n\nWorking with Mastercard to develop digital asset solutions is essential to shaping the future of fintech not only in Kazakhstan but around the world. The introduction of Mastercard Crypto Credential marks a pivotal step in the development of digital finance, providing a trusted framework for the safe and seamless integration of digital assets into the global economy. By providing Intebix clients with Mastercard\u2019s groundbreaking peer-to-peer technology, we are laying the foundation for a more trusted, transparent, and inclusive digital asset ecosystem. \u2013 Talgat Dossanov, CEO, Intebix\n\nAs one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in Kazakhstan, licensed by the AIFC, ATAIX Eurasia is focused on building a legal and accessible cryptocurrency infrastructure in the Eurasian and, eventually, global financial markets.

NVDA CEO Jensen Huang\u2018s cautious outlook on quantum computing, saying that the technology remains years away from practical implementation.\n\nWhat Happened: Speaking on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast Saturday, Zuckerberg acknowledged his limited expertise but supported the industry consensus of a decade-long timeline for widespread quantum computing adoption.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really an expert on quantum computing, but my understanding is that it\u2019s still quite a ways off from being a truly practical paradigm,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nHis comments follow Huang\u2019s recent statement at Nvidia\u2019s CES 2025 that practical quantum computers could be 15 to 30 years away, which triggered significant market turbulence.\n\nQuantum computing stocks saw sharp declines last week after Huang\u2019s comments, with IonQ Inc. IONQ falling 39%, Quantum Computing Inc. QUBT dropping 43.34%, and Rigetti Computing Inc. RGTI tumbling 45.41%.\n\nSee Also: Palantir Co-Founder Joe Lonsdale Sets Realistic Expectations For Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE Initiative: \u2018Next Trillion Will Be A Lot Harder\u2019\n\nWhy It Matters: However, D-Wave Quantum Inc.

He advocated for widespread AI deployment as a security measure, drawing parallels to software vulnerability management.\n\nMarket analyst Jim Cramer urged investors to exercise caution regarding quantum computing investments, warning about sector overvaluation. \u201cWe need you out before the froth goes away,\u201d Cramer said, as quantum computing stocks retreated from their previous gains of up to 800% over the past year.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

It now ranks as the third-largest digital asset, with a market capitalisation of AUD 145.6 billion, surpassing major financial giants like Mastercard and Morgan Stanley. XRP\u2019s price movements reflect growing confidence in its potential as a global payment solution.\n\nFigure 1: XRP\u2019s growth over a month (Credit: CoinSpot)\n\nThe Speculative Frenzy Behind XRP\u2019s Surge\n\nXRP\u2019s rally has been driven largely by speculative enthusiasm. Many retail investors believe it could become the go-to cryptocurrency for international payments. Unlike Bitcoin, seen as digital gold, and Ethereum, powering decentralised finance (DeFi) apps, XRP positions itself as a utility token for seamless cross-border transactions.\n\nRetail investors have flooded forums like r/XRP, where over 600,000 members celebrate milestones and encourage holding the token. The community shares memes and optimistic projections, fuelling further buying pressure.\n\nUtility and Partnerships\n\nRipple Labs has worked extensively to promote XRP as a global payment standard. Its near-instant settlements and minimal transaction fees aim to disrupt traditional financial systems. The company has partnered with over 300 financial institutions, including American Express, Santander, and SBI Holdings.\n\nRipple\u2019s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service uses XRP to enable real-time international payments with transparent fees lower than traditional systems like SWIFT. Over 40 markets worldwide now use ODL, with Bhutan\u2019s central bank integrating it for remittances.\n\nLegal Battles and Ripple\u2019s Recent Wins\n\nXRP\u2019s price rally also ties to Ripple\u2019s legal victories against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC had accused Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering worth AUD 2 billion. The case revolved around Ripple\u2019s control over XRP supply, with the SEC claiming it should be classified as a security.\n\nIn late 2024, Judge Analisa Torres ruled in Ripple\u2019s favour, stating that XRP itself was not a security under federal law. Though the SEC appealed, the decision significantly boosted market confidence. Ripple\u2019s leadership expressed optimism that the regulatory uncertainty would soon be resolved under the new administration, led by crypto-friendly Chair Paul Atkins.\n\nStablecoins and New Developments\n\nRipple has expanded its offerings with the launch of Ripple Liquid USD (RLUSD), a stablecoin backed by cash and U.S. Treasuries. RLUSD bridges the gap between traditional currencies and digital assets, supporting XRP\u2019s ecosystem by providing liquidity.\n\nRipple\u2019s President, Monica Long, stated that RLUSD enhances XRP\u2019s utility by simplifying conversions between fiat and crypto, making transactions faster and more secure.\n\nInstitutional Interest Grows\n\nXRP\u2019s rise has not been limited to retail investors. Institutional demand has surged, with the launch of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in December. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard were among the first to offer XRP-backed products, attracting over AUD 7.5 billion in investments within weeks.\n\nCrypto platforms like CME Group have also introduced XRP futures, while Crypto.com offers high-yield interest products tied to XRP. Eric Steinman, a crypto investment strategist, noted that institutional investors now see XRP as a promising high-reward asset.\n\nCurrent Price Trends and Performance\n\nXRP continues its upward trajectory, with a 343% increase over six months and a 379% gain year-on-year. Recent data shows a market cap of AUD 145.6 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of AUD 7.3 billion.\n\nThe Road Ahead for XRP\n\nDespite its meteoric rise, XRP faces criticism. Some sceptics argue that its rapid price increase mirrors speculative bubbles from past cycles. However, with legal victories, increased institutional adoption, and expanding use cases through ODL and RLUSD, XRP seems positioned for sustained growth in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nVisited 27,209 times, 1 visit(s) today",

As per the aforementioned report, if the economy weakens, some lenders may face difficulties due to their exposure to commercial real estate and possible nonperforming loans. Nonetheless, financials start 2025 with significant momentum due to a less stringent regulatory agenda following the election and more prospects for mergers and acquisitions.\n\nBanks that are well-diversified and have solid fundamentals are better equipped to handle a soft landing situation. Sensitive to consumer spending, payment processors are likewise poised for expansion as more accommodating monetary policy and strong consumer activity coincide.\n\nLooking forward, according to Fidelity\u2019s report, the financial industry\u2019s prospects for 2025 seem promising, backed by consistent economic expansion in the United States. It is projected that the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to rate decreases in the second half of 2024 will boost confidence and lower credit risk. Falling rates have the potential to boost lending and deposit growth while also reducing net interest margins.\n\nAs of January 7, 2025, the market\u2019s financial sector produced returns of 5.51% over three years, 9.68% over five years, and 9.49% over ten years. These numbers, however, pale in comparison to the sector\u2019s remarkable success during the previous 12 months, which saw a return of 28.01%.\n\nThe year 2024 was remarkable for the financial sector, as seen by the Financial Sector Index, which rose over 30% as of mid-December and outperformed the broader market by almost 5 percentage points. This expansion came after worries over mid-sized bank failures in early 2024, which turned out to be isolated events rather than a problem affecting the entire industry.\n\nAccording to the Business Research Company, the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other best financial stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDeloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report states that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. According to the report, the baseline scenario for economic growth in 2025 is projected to fall to 1.5%, with possible deviations between 1.0% and 1.9% due to slowing consumer spending, greater unemployment, and sluggish business investment. By Q2 of 2024, consumer debt had risen to $17.7 trillion, and by March 2024, savings from the pandemic had been spent, further straining the economy. Inflation is forecast to be around 2%, allowing for three to four rate cuts, bringing the federal funds rate down to 350-375 basis points. Treasury yields are projected to fall, and following two years of inversion, the yield curve may normalize. With the exception of economies that are under pressure, global central banks will likely choose to cut benchmark rates.\n\nA woman using a payment terminal at the checkout of a store showing payment products and solutions.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through holdings of financial ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 financial stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nIn 2023, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), one of the Best Financial Stocks, processed about $9 trillion in transactions, making it the second-largest payment processor globally. The business maintains excellent operating margins, benefits from increased travel, and excels at digital and cross-border payments. The firm processes transactions in more than 150 currencies and has operations in more than 200 countries.\n\nDespite inflation and market challenges, the company has shown strong growth and profitability. Although competition and regulatory scrutiny are risks, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is well-positioned for future growth due to its innovative and strategic investments.\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)\u2019s sustainability can be seen in recent financial results. In Q3 of 2024, strong consumer spending and better global macroeconomic conditions drove a 13% YoY growth in revenue. The 10% YoY growth in gross dollar volume and the 17% YoY increase in cross-border volumes point to travel-related and overall spending still being on the rise. Revenue from value-added services increased by 18%, outpacing overall growth, while operating margins increased to 59.3%, resulting in a 16% increase in EPS. The firm continues to provide strong shareholder returns, as seen by its $12 billion authorization for a new share buyback and its $12 billion annual free cash flow. Operating cash flow increased by 58.86% YoY.\n\nJames Faucette, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, increased the price objective from $564 to $654 on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). According to the company\u2019s 2025 forecast statement, its attractive payments and processing market picture is predicated on a number of factors, including a demand for more M&A, quicker investment in competitive strengths, younger consumer preferences, improved investor optimism, and lessened regulatory scrutiny.\n\nKen Griffin\u2019s Citadel Investment Group was the largest stakeholder in the firm among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database. It owns 4.12 million shares worth $2.03 billion as of Q3.\n\nMontaka Global Investments stated the following regarding Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMontaka owns several duopolists in the financial services industry, including Visa and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in payments; and S&P Global in credit ratings and financial data services. These businesses have competitively protected and reliably growing core businesses. But they also have newer, high-probability adjacent opportunities. The market, however, is underappreciating this powerful combination, in our view.\n\nOverall, MA ranks 2nd on our list of the Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential for MA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The project offers family volunteering opportunities, including the ability to search and book activities tailored to the family's preferences based on location in Israel and preferred volunteering sector.\n\nThe range of volunteering opportunities for the public is provided by Ruach Tova, part of the Arison Group, which promotes volunteering in Israel. They offer an online search engine that customizes volunteering options by various categories and geographic regions. The new platform allows families (especially those with children) to plan a day of doing good: coordinating in advance a volunteering activity from a wide variety of opportunities and then continuing the day at one of the local restaurants. Additionally, the initiative aims to support local businesses in Israel in the restaurant and caf\u00e9 sectors, which have suffered since the outbreak of the war, by offering benefits to volunteering families at restaurants near the volunteering locations. The benefits and discounts, ranging from 10% to 15%, will be made accessible to the public through Ontopo.\n\nOrganizations such as the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, Leket Israel, the Monkey Shelter, SPCA, EcoOcean, Chesed Irith, the Yoqne'am Agricultural Education Farm, and others will offer family-friendly volunteering activities in the fields of environmental protection, animal welfare, working with vulnerable populations, and logistical assistance such as packing, organizing, and sorting food and other donations.\n\n''Volunteering Family'' (credit: PR)\n\nThe volunteering selection process is simple and includes three short steps: selecting a suitable date, desired city, and a volunteering category close to the family\u2019s heart. Finally, families can also choose one of the benefits offered by local businesses near the volunteering site.\n\nSumming up previous activities reveals interesting data showcasing the scope of activities and the remarkable willingness of Israelis:\n\nApproximately 4,400 volunteers participated in various activities during August, including walking (and adopting) 1,050 dogs, harvesting 15 tons of fruits and vegetables, collecting 625 bags of trash from 17 parks and streams, spending time with 240 elderly individuals, and packing and distributing 6,200 food baskets to those in need.\n\nCarly Sanders, Marketing Manager at Mastercard Israel, notes: \"The launch of the 'Volunteering Family' platform makes it possible for the first time, with just one click, to easily search and book a shared volunteering activity for the entire family. Following the success and the willingness of many families to volunteer during the summer, we are proud to extend the opportunity through December. The initiative stems from the understanding that family quality time is priceless. Parents realize that doing good together has educational value, and at the same time, creates unforgettable experiences and memories that money can't buy.\"",

The date and details aren't final yet, but changes for both Discover and Capital One cardholders could be on the horizon.\n\n\"Capital One has said that it will transition its cards from the Visa and Mastercard payment networks to the Discover card network,\" said Jason Steele, a CNET Money expert review board member and credit card expert.\n\nIf you're a Capital One cardholder, experts don't expect major changes right away, but if the merger goes through, your card will likely be shifted to the Discover payment network eventually.\n\nHow changing payment networks could impact you\n\nDiscover is one of the four major credit card networks, along with Visa, Mastercard and American Express. Right now, Capital One offers both Visa and Mastercard credit cards but would likely slowly begin to shift their cards to the Discover network if the acquisition goes through.\n\nWhy does this matter? Discover's network is smaller than Visa and Mastercard and isn't accepted everywhere in the US or abroad.\n\n\"While many countries where Discover isn't widely accepted are places that aren't popular tourist destinations, some are,\" Steele said. For example, Discover isn't accepted in Panama, Kenya and Serbia, according to its website. In countries where Discover is accepted, the rules can vary by store. Steele also added that Discover isn't currently accepted at all major US retailers, such as Costco.\n\nHowever, Capital One plans to expand Discover's payment network, which could increase its footprint overseas in the future. \"We continue to believe that Visa and Mastercard play a very important part in Capital One's future, but that we can build a network and a network story that over time can take more of our volume,\" said Capital One's CEO, Richard Fairbank, at a Dec. 2024 Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference.\n\nExperts think that in the long run, this merger could spell good news for both Capital One and Discover cardholders, alike.\n\n\"Capital One acquired Discover in large part for its processing network,\" said Aaron Hurd, a credit card expert and CNET Money expert review board member. Hurd predicts that over time, Capital One will expand Discover's payment network, both overseas and in the US. This expansion would make it easier to use your Discover card abroad, as well as any Capital One cards that are moved to this network.\n\nHow to prepare for the Capital One and Discover merger\n\nHurd expects Capital One to continue operating both brands somewhat autonomously for some time. \"Capital One probably won't alienate Discover's large customer base by discontinuing the Discover card brand,\" he said. Hurd does expect small changes to products after the acquisition.\n\nIf you depend on your Capital One credit card as your primary payment method, you'll likely eventually be ported over to the Discover network. Although there are plans to expand this payment network, if you're worried about traveling abroad, Steele suggests looking for a backup Visa or Mastercard option.\n\nThis acquisition isn't finalized, but experts expect it will pass. If the merger goes through, look for updates from either Discover or Capital One about any changes.",

After a hard fought contest, the hosts managed to get the result in their favor 19-17.\n\nAshan Bandara executed a 50/22 and gave the team the opportunity to attack with a lineout. After the driving maul gained some good meters the forwards were patient and made some good inroads as a line offside penalty was also awarded.

            "content": "The Drum catches up with the chief marketing and communications officer in Las Vegas to find out about his sensory-driven marketing strategy, Mastercard\u2019s partnership with Netflix and more.\n\nCES 2025 brought Las Vegas roaring back to life, buzzing with energy, innovation and, of course, buzzwords. This year, the term agentic dominated conversations \u2013 an evolution of generative AI that has profound implications for marketers. Sitting down with Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing and communications officer at Mastercard, I got a first-hand account of how his sensory-driven marketing strategy offers a roadmap for CMOs navigating this new era.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nFrom generative to agentic: the AI shift\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a fantastic CES,\u201d Rajamannar said. \u201cAI is advancing at an unstoppable pace. Last year, we were all talking about generative AI. Now, it\u2019s about agentic AI \u2013 everyone\u2019s talking about it and it\u2019s visible all over the place.\u201d\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Rajamannar broke it down: \u201cGenerative AI provides options \u2013 it creates things, whether it\u2019s images, travel itineraries, or book summaries. Agentic AI goes further. It makes decisions and takes actions on your behalf.\u201d He likened it to a digital executive assistant, explaining: \u201cImagine asking your AI to find the best hotel in Vegas for CES and then booking it. It\u2019s a game-changer for efficiency and accessibility.\u201d\n\nBut what does this mean for marketing? Rajamannar\u2019s answer was clear: marketers are no longer speaking directly to consumers but to their AI agents. \u201cIt\u2019s an era of bot-to-bot marketing. Your machines are now marketing to consumers\u2019 machines. I wrote about this in my book, Quantum Marketing, and it\u2019s incredible to see it validated today.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMulti-sensory marketing: beyond the screen\n\nIf agentic AI represents the future, multi-sensory marketing is the bridge that will get us there. For Mastercard, this isn\u2019t a new concept \u2013 it\u2019s been a cornerstone of its strategy for over a decade.\n\n\u201cTraditional marketing focuses on sight and sound \u2013 videos, ads, screens,\u201d Rajamannar said. \u201cBut people have five senses. Why limit ourselves to two?\u201d Mastercard\u2019s multi-sensory strategy incorporates touch, taste and smell to create immersive experiences.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from number 87 on the BrandZ rankings to number 11. It\u2019s proof that our strategy works.\u201d\n\nOne standout example? The Priceless Experiences platform, which curates both digital and physical events tied to consumers\u2019 passions. During the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup, Mastercard created a trophy that emitted sound when touched \u2013 a literal embodiment of their multi-sensory approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPartnering with Netflix: a vision for experiential marketing\n\nThis year at CES, Mastercard unveiled a new strategic partnership with Netflix. \u201cNetflix has been exploring physical experiences tied to their shows and we saw an opportunity to collaborate.\u201d\n\nThe partnership\u2019s first venture? Netflix Bites \u2013 a series of themed restaurants inspired by popular shows such as Bridgerton. Mastercard customers can access exclusive perks, from early bookings to premium seating. \u201cWe even created signature cocktails like \u2018Streaming Optimism\u2019 to bring a fun, branded twist.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a deeper lesson here. As Rajamannar pointed out, consumers are moving away from screen-based interactions and craving real-world experiences. \u201cOur research shows people increasingly value experiences over things. Whether it\u2019s dining out or traveling, they want to engage with the world. Partnering with Netflix lets us tap into this trend while creating unique value for our customers.\u201d\n\nSuggested newsletters for you Daily Briefing Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team. Weekly Marketing Stay up to date with a curated digest of the most important marketing stories and expert insights from our global team. The Drum Insider Learn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nAs we step into the agentic age, CMOs face a dual challenge: embracing new technologies while reconnecting with the fundamentals of human experience. For Rajamannar, the key lies in balancing innovation with authenticity.\n\n\u201cAgentic AI will revolutionize how we target and engage consumers. But at the end of the day, marketing is about creating connections \u2013 and there\u2019s no better way to do that than through experiences that resonate with all five senses.\u201d\n\nIf CES 2025 proved anything, it\u2019s that the future of marketing isn\u2019t just about adapting to AI \u2013 it\u2019s about using it to enhance the ways we connect, create and inspire. And for those willing to embrace the shift, the possibilities are truly priceless.",

            "content": "As digital payments morph into strategic assets, India is offering a template for other nations seeking to reduce dependence on Western payment networks.\n\nRegulators around the world are notching up scrutiny on Visa and Mastercard over the fees they charge merchants, but India has chosen a different path: creating rival payment networks that are increasingly sidelining international card networks.\n\nIndia's strategy builds on the Unified Payments Interface, known as UPI, a nine-year-old system that lets consumers and merchants bypass traditional card networks by connecting bank accounts directly through QR codes and phone numbers.\n\nThe UPI network now processes more than 13 billion real-time transactions monthly \u2014 that's about 71% of all transactions in the world's most populous nation \u2014 and accounts for 36% of all consumer spending in the country, according to an analysis by Bernstein.\n\nUPI's dramatic success hasn't gone unnoticed. The local government has been leveraging the system's success to reshape its credit card market with RuPay, a homegrown card network. RuPay enjoys a crucial advantage: It's the only payment system allowed to process credit card transactions through UPI.\n\nThis exclusivity, granted only in 2022, is proving transformative: RuPay processed \u20b9638 billion ($7.43 billion) in UPI credit card transactions in the first seven months of fiscal year 2025, nearly double from a year earlier.\n\nThese figures now account for 28% of all credit card transactions in India, up from 10% last year, according to Bernstein. (RuPay's credit card figures don't include swipes at merchant outlets and some other transactions, as that data isn't available, so its market share is likely even higher.)\n\nAnd last year, authorities began working aggressively to further popularize the adoption of RuPay credit cards, a push that many banks initially resisted, citing concerns about losing interchange fees.\n\nThe strategy involves careful calibration of fees. RuPay credit cards on UPI only charge merchants for transactions worth more than \u20b92,000 ($23.3). This structure has particular appeal for small businesses that have historically resisted credit cards to avoid paying merchant fees, since the average UPI credit transaction currently runs lower than \u20b91,000.\n\nWhat's more, India's central bank last year ordered lenders to let consumers choose their card network when taking or renewing credit cards, prohibiting exclusive agreements with global networks. In August, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which oversees both UPI and RuPay, directed banks to ensure RuPay cardholders receive the same rewards as other networks.",

            "content": "Image credit: Getty Images\n\nGlobal payments provider Mastercard has introduced its Crypto Credential solution to the UAE and Kazakhstan, marking its debut in the Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EEMEA) region.\n\nMastercard Crypto Credential allows users to send and receive cryptocurrencies using simple aliases instead of complex blockchain addresses. The system ensures that transactions proceed only when the recipient\u2019s wallet supports the transferred asset, reducing the risk of failed or lost transactions.\n\n\u201cAs the cryptocurrency landscape continues to mature, we\u2019ve been laser focused on developing innovative services and capabilities that help make crypto more accessible and secure, streamline the transaction process and enhance trust in the ecosystem,\u201d said Gaurang Shah, executive vice president and head of core payments for EEMEA at Mastercard.\n\n\u201cIn bringing Mastercard Crypto Credential to the EEMEA region, we\u2019re delivering on our vision to increase and instill trust in blockchain technology while also transforming the way that people interact with digital assets.\u201d\n\nThe initiative, launched in collaboration with ATAIX Eurasia, Intebix, CoinMENA, and Fuze, is designed to enhance trust in blockchain transactions by verifying users and ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks, including the Travel Rule.\n\nThe Travel Rule is a global anti-money laundering (AML) regulation requiring financial institutions, including crypto exchanges, to share identifying information about the sender and recipient of transactions above a certain threshold.\n\nEstablished by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the rule applies to virtual asset service providers (VASPs) such as cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers. The objective is to prevent money laundering, fraud, and terrorism financing by ensuring transparency in cross-border and domestic digital asset transactions.\n\nHow it works and future expansion\n\nMastercard Crypto Credential operates through a verification and alias-based transaction process.\n\nUsers are verified under Mastercard Crypto Credential standards through participating exchanges. Once verified, they receive a unique alias to send and receive crypto across supported platforms. Finally, before a transaction is processed, the system checks if the recipient\u2019s alias and wallet support the asset and blockchain. If not, the transaction is blocked, preventing potential fund losses.\n\nWhile the pilot phase focuses on peer-to-peer transactions, Mastercard plans to expand Crypto Credential\u2019s applications to NFTs, ticketing, and other payment solutions, subject to regulatory requirements.\n\nWith this expansion, the UAE and Kazakhstan join markets in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific, where the solution is already in use. A limited group of crypto wallet users will gain early access, with a broader rollout expected in the coming months.\n\nIndustry reaction\n\nIndustry leaders have welcomed the move, with Talal Tabba, CEO of CoinMENA, praising Mastercard\u2019s efforts to build trust in digital assets.\n\n\u201cInnovations like Mastercard Crypto Credential program are key to building trust and making digital assets more accessible and user-friendly, especially for joiners from traditional finance,\u201d Tabba said.",

Unlike with many regular credit cards, when you apply, you\u2019ll know almost immediately whether you\u2019ve been approved or if your application needs to go to a manual review.\n\nWith manual verification, it can take an additional two to three business days. If you\u2019re approved, your application goes forward for credit checks while your card is printed and mailed. You can usually expect your card within five to seven business days, but some lenders allow you to start using your account even before it arrives.\n\nInstant approval vs instant use\n\nMany of the biggest credit card issuers in Canada offer instant approval, meaning you can apply for the card online and find out if you\u2019re approved within minutes. However, only select cards offer instant use. That\u2019s when you can start using the credit account digitally right after approval, before your physical card even arrives in the mail.\n\nWhat do you need to get instantly approved for a credit card?\n\nAs with any credit card application, there are a few requirements you\u2019ll need to meet in order to obtain an instant approval credit card.\n\nYou must be a permanent resident or Canadian citizen. (If you don\u2019t meet this requirement, there are credit cards that allow applications without this criteria, such as secured credit cards.)\n\nYou must be the age of majority. In Canada, the age of majority is 18 or 19 years old and older, depending on your province of residence.\n\nYou must not have a history of bankruptcy if you\u2019re applying for an unsecured credit card. Most rewards and low-interest credit card options are unsecured, but there are secured credit cards that you can apply for even if you\u2019ve declared yourself bankrupt.\n\nNo matter the kind of credit card you\u2019re applying for, a good credit score will increase your chances of being approved.\n\nBefore you start an instant approval application, make sure you have the following information at hand:\n\nYour social insurance number (SIN)\n\nYour employment information\n\nYour income information\n\nThe application form may ask for other information, and some of it may be optional. The more details you provide, the more efficient the credit card approval process will be.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve been approved, your application will still have to go out for proper credit checks. All cards require a credit check, except for secured cards and cards from an institution that you have an established relationship with. In some cases, you\u2019ll be contacted for information or clarification. Shortly after, your card will be produced and mailed to the address on file.\n\nWhat to do if your application for an instant approval card is declined\n\nIf your instant approval credit card application is declined, the good news is that you\u2019ll usually know the reason immediately.\n\nIf you get a message that your application is being reviewed, it may not be declined\u2014it may simply mean that the credit card issuer needs to verify your identity and information before making a decision. This may take an extra day or two.\n\nAlternatively, if you get an instant decline, consider doing the following:\n\nReview the credit card eligibility requirements, such as credit score and income, to see if you meet them.\n\nReview your credit report to check for issues and errors. You can get your credit report for free from Equifax and TransUnion.\n\nIf needed, take steps to fix your credit report and improve your credit score.\n\nConsider applying for another credit card with eligibility requirements that can you easily meet or exceed.\n\nHow to increase your odds of instant approval for a credit card\n\nTo improve your chances of getting an instant approval credit card, show the credit card issuer that your finances are in good standing. Having the following helps:\n\nA good to excellent credit score: This tells the credit card issuer that you have a healthy credit utilization ratio and little to no debt.\n\nThis tells the credit card issuer that you have a healthy credit utilization ratio and little to no debt. A low number of credit inquiries: Avoid applying for too many credit cards, loans or lines of credit at the same time. These will temporarily affect your credit score as it suggests that you\u2019re in need of money.\n\nAvoid applying for too many credit cards, loans or lines of credit at the same time. These will temporarily affect your credit score as it suggests that you\u2019re in need of money. An existing relationship with the credit card issuer: If you\u2019re applying for a credit card from a bank where you already have a chequing or savings account, they can easily verify your income and credit history, making instant approval much more likely.\n\nIf you\u2019re applying for a credit card from a bank where you already have a chequing or savings account, they can easily verify your income and credit history, making instant approval much more likely. Consistent income: Even if your credit card application isn\u2019t instantly approved, any additional requests for information usually revolve around proof of income. If you\u2019re asked for these, have your paystubs or bank statements ready to share with the credit card issuer.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhat is the easiest credit card to get in Canada? It\u2019s important to remember that \u201cinstant approval\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201ceasy approval.\u201d With instant approval cards, you still have to meet the eligibility criteria, which might include a minimum annual income and/or credit score. As a rule, secured cards and cards intended for people who are establishing or rebuilding their credit are the easiest to access. Does instant approval mean guaranteed approval? No. Even with an instant approval credit card, your application must be approved\u2014but the process is super quick. Certain instant approval cards in Canada, like the Capital One Guaranteed Approval Mastercard, come with guaranteed approval, though conditions still apply. What features do instant approval credit cards offer? If you browse the list above, you\u2019ll see that some instant approval cards have welcome offers and/or rewards in the form of cash back or points (check the \u201cearn rate\u201d to see which ones). You can also find cards with appealing perks. Does applying for an instant approval credit card impact my credit score? Yes. Think of the application process as being the same as any other credit card, just faster. When applying for an instant approval credit card, you\u2019ll be asked to provide your personal information so that the card issuer can perform a credit check, which may temporarily knock down your credit score. With this in mind, avoid applying for multiple cards at the same time. Is there a credit card that approves everyone? Strictly speaking, no credit card will approve everyone. Even easy approval credit cards require checks on your creditworthiness and ensure you can pay back what you spend before approving your application. For a near guaranteed credit card, try applying for a secured credit card, which requires you to provide a cash deposit\u2014it serves as collateral and usually dictates the spending limit on your credit card.\n\nMore of Canada\u2019s best credit cards:",

            "content": "As digital payments morph into strategic assets, India is offering a template for other nations seeking to reduce dependence on Western payment networks.\n\nRegulators around the world are notching up scrutiny on Visa and Mastercard over the fees they charge merchants, but India has chosen a different path: creating rival payment networks that are increasingly sidelining international card networks.\n\nIndia\u2019s strategy builds on the Unified Payments Interface, known as UPI, a nine-year-old system that lets consumers and merchants bypass traditional card networks by connecting bank accounts directly through QR codes and phone numbers.\n\nThe UPI network now processes more than 13 billion real-time transactions monthly \u2014 that\u2019s about 71% of all transactions in the world\u2019s most populous nation \u2014 and accounts for 36% of all consumer spending in the country, according to an analysis by Bernstein.\n\nUPI\u2019s dramatic success hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. The local government has been leveraging the system\u2019s success to reshape its credit card market with RuPay, a homegrown card network. RuPay enjoys a crucial advantage: It\u2019s the only payment system allowed to process credit card transactions through UPI.\n\nThis exclusivity, granted only in 2022, is proving transformative: RuPay processed \u20b9638 billion ($7.43 billion) in UPI credit card transactions in the first seven months of fiscal year 2025, nearly double from a year earlier.\n\nThese figures now account for 28% of all credit card transactions in India, up from 10% last year, according to Bernstein. (RuPay\u2019s credit card figures don\u2019t include swipes at merchant outlets and some other transactions, as that data isn\u2019t available, so its market share is likely even higher.)\n\nAnd last year, authorities began working aggressively to further popularize the adoption of RuPay credit cards, a push that many banks initially resisted, citing concerns about losing interchange fees.\n\nThe strategy involves careful calibration of fees. RuPay credit cards on UPI only charge merchants for transactions worth more than \u20b92,000 ($23.3). This structure has particular appeal for small businesses that have historically resisted credit cards to avoid paying merchant fees, since the average UPI credit transaction currently runs lower than \u20b91,000.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, India\u2019s central bank last year ordered lenders to let consumers choose their card network when taking or renewing credit cards, prohibiting exclusive agreements with global networks. In August, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which oversees both UPI and RuPay, directed banks to ensure RuPay cardholders receive the same rewards as other networks.\n\nThe push seems to be working: RuPay accounted for half of all new credit cards issued in India in June 2024, according to a recent disclosure by a lawmaker in parliament.\n\n\u201cAssuming UPI linkage remains exclusive for RuPay cards, RuPay is likely to emerge as the dominant network for credit cards,\u201d a Bernstein report on Friday read.\n\n\u201cOnce the QR code based payments become dominant for credit based payments too, credit accounts of banks could be directly linked to the UPI network bypassing the cards,\u201d the research firm wrote.\n\nFacing such a strong push by the local government and changing consumer behavior, payment giants Visa and Mastercard have been forced to change how they operate in India. They have partnered with fintechs in recent months to extend card support to UPI-powered merchant terminals, used by more than 10 million shopkeepers in India. It\u2019s quite the spectacle: The same card networks didn\u2019t find it feasible to work with such small merchants just a couple years ago.\n\nBut those efforts might be too little, too late. The stratospheric growth of UPI is blowing away the credit card industry at large \u2014 credit cards\u2019 market share in India\u2019s digital payments fell to 21% in 2024 from 43% in 2018. For Visa and MasterCard, the threat is real, and the battle is about to go uphill if they don\u2019t find a way to turn this opportunity into an advantage.",

            "content": "Card Basics\n\nCard type Mastercard Card issuer Cross River Bank Annual fee $40 Annual percentage rate (APR) 29.88% Foreign transaction fee 3% Card benefits Easy approval with no deposit required\n\nReports to the credit reporting agencies\n\nRecently, my friend decided to buy a home. She had no credit history since she had steered clear of debt, so she needed to improve her credit score to get a mortgage. To do that, she applied for a secured credit card, which meant putting down a deposit. This option can help you show you're responsible and build your credit score, but not everybody can afford to do that.\n\nThe Yendo credit card is a Mastercard that you can get approved for by using your car as collateral. This alternative provides access to a credit line of up to $10,000 without making a cash deposit to secure the debt. This may seem like a good idea, but it's actually a high-risk strategy that I wouldn't recommend to my friend or anyone else.\n\nWhen you request pre-approval, Yendo won't do a hard credit check. Rather than deciding whether to approve you solely based on your credit history, Yendo also considers details about your vehicle, expenses, and income. It will evaluate how much your car is worth versus what you owe on it to approve you for a credit line based on those factors and your ability to pay.\n\nOnce approved, you get instant access to a virtual card while you wait for the physical version. You'll pay a $40 annual fee and be able to charge up to your credit limit.\n\nYendo reports your payment history to the three credit reporting agencies. This is a big benefit because it can help you build credit. The big downside is that you risk losing your car if you don't make your payments.\n\nWho should get the Yendo credit card?\n\nThe Yendo card isn't right for everyone. Let's look at situations where you may want to apply.\n\nYou have lots of equity in an eligible vehicle\n\nTo decide whether you can borrow and how much you can get, Yendo considers the amount of equity you have in your vehicle. That's the amount you owe versus the value of the car. For example, if your car is worth $15,000 and has a $7,000 loan balance remaining, your equity would be $8,000. Yendo also requires that the car works and is no older than a 1996 model.\n\nIf you don't have sufficient equity in an eligible vehicle, Yendo won't approve you, and if you have very little equity, you may get a very low credit limit. Keep in mind your overall finances will also impact your credit limit and approval. You could qualify for anywhere from $450 to $10,000, so consider whether your potential credit line is sufficient for your borrowing needs.\n\nYou want to build credit but can't make a deposit\n\nMost secured cards allow you to make a deposit, which may or may not equal your credit line, to qualify. You can use that card responsibly and pay the bills on time to build credit. This is the type of card my friend got to improve her score.\n\nSince Yendo doesn't require a deposit, it can be a good option if you can't afford to tie up your money. Remember, though, that rather than putting your cash on the line, you're putting your vehicle at risk.\n\nIn exchange for credit, Yendo requires providing your car's title if you own it outright or transferring the auto loan if you're still making payments. However, you do retain ownership of the vehicle while you have the card.\n\nYou're confident you won't default\n\nBefore applying for the Yendo card, you must be 100% confident you will never charge more than you can pay back. If you fail to fulfill your obligations, you could lose your car. You don't want to take a chance of this happening unless you trust yourself not to overspend. You might find Yendo a bigger risk than simply losing a bank deposit like with a regular secured card.\n\nWhat should you know before applying?\n\nBefore deciding on a Yendo card, you should weigh the risks of secured vs. unsecured debt.\n\nIf you have unsecured debt, your lender only has your promise to repay it since there's no physical property as collateral. If you don't pay, the lender could take steps such as charging fees or sending the account to collections. In serious cases, the lender might take you to court and potentially garnish your wages or put a lien on your property to enforce the judgment. However, it's very rare to actually lose your property with unsecured debt.\n\nWith secured debt, you put up an asset as collateral. The lender gets an ownership interest (lienholder) and can take the asset if you don't pay. With the Yendo card, you're using your vehicle to guarantee the credit line, and you take the very big risk that you could lose your car if you fall behind in payments.\n\nTop benefits of the Yendo credit card\n\nHere are some of the biggest benefits of the Yendo secured card.\n\nYou can build credit: Yendo reports to Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. It can be hard to find a lender willing to give you a credit line or loan if you don't already have good credit, so this is a major benefit for building credit to work toward goals like buying a home.\n\nYendo reports to Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.

You can refinance your car loan: If you apply for the card and still have a car loan, refinancing it through Yendo might lower your monthly car payments.\n\nIf you apply for the card and still have a car loan, refinancing it through Yendo might lower your monthly car payments. You don't have to put down a deposit: My friend had to put down a $200 deposit to get a card with a $200 limit.

Not everyone can afford to tie up money like this, and Yendo avoids this potential roadblock. You might get access to a large credit limit: Many secured cards have low limits that might start at just a few hundred dollars. Yendo allows you to borrow as much as $10,000 depending on how much equity you have in your vehicle and your overall financial situation.\n\nWhy you might want a different credit card\n\nThere are also some big disadvantages of the Yendo card, including:\n\nThere's a $40 annual fee: Some secured cards don't charge you just to be a cardholder, and the annual fee can get costly alongside Yendo's high APR.\n\nSome secured cards don't charge you just to be a cardholder, and the annual fee can get costly alongside Yendo's high APR. You could lose your car: It's a much bigger problem if your car is repossessed than if you lose a few hundred dollars with a secured card that just requires a cash deposit. You might prefer a traditional secured card with a low deposit requirement to avoid that high risk and still get access to credit.\n\nIt's a much bigger problem if your car is repossessed than if you lose a few hundred dollars with a secured card that just requires a cash deposit. You might prefer a traditional secured card with a low deposit requirement to avoid that high risk and still get access to credit. You'll pay foreign transaction fees: Using your card abroad can get expensive due to Yendo's 3% foreign transaction fee, which you can avoid with some alternative cards.\n\nUsing your card abroad can get expensive due to Yendo's 3% foreign transaction fee, which you can avoid with some alternative cards. You won't earn any credit card rewards: Many other cards, including some secured options, allow you to earn rewards on your purchases. Unfortunately, Yendo doesn't.\n\nAlternative credit cards to consider\n\nWhen you're trying to build credit, carefully research the best credit cards to see which one makes sense for you. This is especially important if you are looking for secured cards because they can come with high costs. Here are three cards that might be better options for you than Yendo.\n\nDiscover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card\n\nThe Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card allows you to qualify by making a refundable deposit. You can open an account with as little as $200. This is a lot less risky than putting your car on the line. You can earn rewards on purchases and Discover will match all the cash back you\u2019ve earned at the end of your first year. There's also a $0 annual fee.\n\nThis is the card I told my friend to get. If it's at all possible to save up $200 and your goal is to build credit rather than gain access to the largest credit line, consider choosing the Discover it Secured Credit Card rather than using Yendo.\n\nRead our Discover it Secured Credit Card review.\n\nBankAmericard\u00ae \ufe0f Secured Credit Card\n\nThe BankAmericard\u00ae\ufe0f Secured Credit Card allows you to gain access to between $200 and $5,000 in credit, depending on your deposit amount. There is a $0 annual fee, and you get cardholder benefits, including free monthly FICO score updates for keeping tabs on your credit-building efforts.\n\nBank of America will also periodically review your card to see if you qualify to get part of your refund returned to you. This is a huge benefit since you may eventually qualify for some unsecured debt.\n\nCapital One Platinum Secured Credit Card\n\nThe Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card offers the option to get pre-approved with no damage to your credit and lets you gain access to a line of credit with a deposit of $49, $99, or $200. Your deposit is refundable, and over time, you can become eligible to upgrade to an unsecured Capital One Platinum card.\n\nThere's a $0 annual fee for this secured card, and you can make additional deposits to raise your credit line to as high as $1,000. With the low deposit requirements, this option can be a great choice if you're worried about affordability.\n\nRead our Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card review.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs Yendo worth it? Yendo isn't a good option for many people. You have to put your car on the line to gain access to a line of credit. Other secured cards don't require this, and some also allow you to borrow without the $40 annual fee that Yendo charges. How is my credit limit determined with Yendo? Yendo determines your credit line based on your ability to pay and the equity in your vehicle, which is how much your car is worth versus the amount you owe on it. Your vehicle's value depends on factors such as its condition, model, and mileage. Is Yendo a real credit card? Yendo provides you with a line of credit guaranteed by your vehicle and will send you a Mastercard to use for purchases, balance transfers, and cash advances. While it's a real credit card, Yendo differs from most other cards because your car is the collateral. How long does it take to get a Yendo card? You can get pre-approved for a Yendo card in two to three minutes and receive a virtual card as soon as you provide the required documentation, including your car's title if you own it outright, and get final approval. You'll have to wait longer for the physical card to arrive.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you don't mind risking your vehicle for access to a line of credit and paying a $40 annual fee to do it, Yendo could work for you. Just make sure that you can control your spending and not miss any monthly payments while you use this card to build your credit.\n\nIf Yendo doesn't seem like the best financial choice, choosing a regular secured credit card is a far better option. You can look for secured cards that have low deposit requirements and no annual fees and then rework your budget to save up for the deposit. Once you build your credit, consider looking for traditional credit cards with more perks and no collateral requirements.",

However, its strict income requirements and complex welcome offer might deter some applicants.\n\n4.6 /5 4.6 NerdWallet rating National Bank World Elite Mastercard Annual fee $150 Interest rates 20.99% / 22.49% Rewards rate 1x-5x Points View details\n\nNational Bank World Elite Mastercard full review\n\nThe National Bank World Elite Mastercard is a mid-priced rewards card tied to the National Bank\u2019s \u00c0 la carte Rewards Plan. Cardholders earn points that can be redeemed for travel, merchandise, financial products, and more.\n\nThis card caters to frequent travelers and those who spend heavily on groceries and dining, but its value depends on how well you maximize its features and redemption options.\n\nBenefits of the National Bank World Elite Mastercard\n\nGenerous earn rates: Earn 5x points per dollar on groceries and dining (up to $2,500 per month), with a 2x rate applying after the cap is reached. All other purchases earn 1x points.\n\nFlexible redemption options : Use points to book travel, contribute to an RRSP or TFSA, pay down your credit card bill, or even apply them toward your mortgage.\n\nPremium travel perks: Enjoy free, unlimited access to the National Bank Lounge at Montr\u00e9al-Trudeau Airport (international trips only, with a 3-hour limit).\n\nValuable travel reimbursement: Receive up to $150 annually for eligible travel expenses, such as airport parking or baggage fees.\n\nComprehensive insurance: Robust travel coverage includes medical insurance, trip cancellation, and interruption insurance, plus a two-year extended warranty on eligible purchases \u2014 longer than most comparable cards.\n\nDiscounted banking fees: Cardholders receive reduced fees on select National Bank account packages.\n\nDrawbacks of the National Bank World Elite Mastercard\n\nMonthly cap on 5x rewards: The high earn rate for groceries and dining drops to 2x after $2,500 in monthly spending, regardless of the category. While competitive, this limitation may not suit high spenders.\n\nRestricted lounge access: Free lounge visits are only available for international flights and limited to three hours.\n\nHigh income requirements: Applicants must earn $80,000 individually or $150,000 as a household, making this card inaccessible for some applicants.\n\nVariable point value: The value of \u00c0 la carte Rewards points depends on redemption. Points are worth 1 cent each when booking through the \u00c0 la carte Travel Agency (10,000 points = $100), but other methods may offer significantly lower values.\n\nNo transfer options: Points cannot be transferred to other loyalty programs, which limits flexibility for frequent flyers.\n\nComplex welcome offer: The 40,000 bonus points requires you to complete several steps over 15 months, which might feel overly complicated for a reward that isn\u2019t particularly generous.\n\nWho should get the National Bank World Elite Mastercard?\n\nTravellers, dining enthusiasts, and big grocery spenders seeking to offset travel costs will get the most out of this card, especially if they prioritize travel insurance.\n\nIs the National Bank World Elite Mastercard worth it?\n\nThe National Bank World Elite Mastercard is worth it for cardholders who can leverage its 5x earn rate and travel perks to offset its $150 annual fee. For example:\n\nSpending $3,000 annually on groceries and dining at the 5x rate earns enough points to cover the annual fee if redeemed through the \u00c0 la carte Travel Agency (where points are worth 1 cent each).\n\nAlternatively, using the $150 annual travel reimbursement effectively cancels out the annual fee.\n\nNational Bank customer ratings Below average in customer satisfaction: The National Bank ranks 8th out of 13 issuers in J.D. Power\u2019s 2024 Canada Credit Card Satisfaction Study.\n\nLow Trustpilot rating: The National Bank of Canada scored 1.6 out of 5 possible stars based on over 75 customer reviews, as of this writing.\n\nLow Better Business Bureau rating: The National Bank of Canada scored 1 out of 5 possible stars based on just two customer reviews, as of this writing.\n\nNational Bank World Elite Mastercard eligibility\n\nWho qualifies for the National Bank World Elite Mastercard?\n\nTo qualify for the National Bank World Elite Mastercard, you must be the age of majority in your province or territory and a Canadian resident.\n\nYou must also meet one of the following requirements:\n\nHave a gross annual income of at least $80,000 ($150,000 per household).\n\nBe an existing National Bank customer and make a minimum of $25,000 in transactions with your card annually.\n\nHave at least $400,000 in investable assets.\n\nApproximate credit score needed for approval\n\nCanadian credit card issuers rarely disclose required credit scores, which makes it hard to know your chances of approval when comparing credit cards.

            "content": "Mastercard Incorporated (MA), headquartered in Purchase, New York, provides transaction processing and other payment-related products and services. Valued at $469.9 billion by market cap, the company offers payment processing services for credit and debit cards, electronic cash, automated teller machines, and travelers checks. The payments giant is expected to announce its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings for 2024 on Wednesday, Jan. 29.\n\nAhead of the event, analysts expect MA to report a profit of $3.68 per share on a diluted basis, up 15.7% from $3.18 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has consistently surpassed Wall Street\u2019s EPS estimates in its last four quarterly reports.\n\nFor the full year, analysts expect MA to report EPS of $14.46, up 17.9% from $12.26 in fiscal 2023. Its EPS is expected to rise 12.6% year over year to $16.28 in fiscal 2025.\n\nMA stock has underperformed the S&P 500\u2019s ($SPX) 25.8% gains over the past 52 weeks, with shares up 21.9% during this period. Similarly, it underperformed the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLF) 28% gains over the same time frame.\n\nMastercard's underperformance is driven by growing regulatory pressures to reduce swipe fees, increasing competition from \"buy now, pay later\" platforms like Affirm Holdings, Inc. (AFRM), and rising operating costs. Moreover, rejected settlements and potential fee reductions may squeeze margins. Its inflation and regulatory hurdles may limit consumer purchasing power. The company faces headwinds from proposed legislation, such as the Credit Card Competition Act of 2023, which could alter the competitive landscape and impact profitability.\n\nOn Oct. 31, MA shares closed down more than 2% after reporting its Q3 results. Its adjusted EPS of $3.89 beat Wall Street expectations of $3.73. The company\u2019s revenue was $7.4 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $7.3 billion.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 consensus opinion on MA stock is bullish, with a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating overall. Out of 37 analysts covering the stock, 29 advise a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating, three suggest a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and five give a \u201cHold.\u201d MA\u2019s average analyst price target is $568.83, indicating a potential upside of 11.2% from the current levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

But amid the chaos were signs of hope, courtesy of people who proved that our efforts do make a difference in the fight against climate change.\n\nThese Mastercard employees, partners and innovators made a marked effort in 2024 to restore and protect areas all around the globe in ways that will be long-lasting and impactful.\n\nMitigating risk from extreme weather\n\nEnsuring that Mastercard's people and facilities are safe - no matter what Mother Nature throws their way - is a job Montana Eck and his climate risk and resilience team approach with enthusiasm and empathy. After all, Eck himself lives in Asheville, North Carolina, which was hit particularly hard by Hurricane Helene.\n\nHis team is developing comprehensive plans to enhance the company's physical resiliency, including a checklist to mitigate the impact of extreme weather on infrastructure and landscaping designed to withstand both higher- and lower-than-normal temperatures for years to come. In the meantime, they're making changes like painting parking lots and rooftops in cooler colors so they reflect rather than absorb heat and elevating equipment in flood-prone areas.\n\nReforesting former mining sites\n\nGreen Forests Work is planting trees to regenerate forests and spur local economies that have been destroyed by coal mining. \"If you're going to put money into reforestation projects, there's so much benefit to doing it on mined land,\" says Chris Barton, Green Forests Work's founder and president. \"They're a scar on the landscape.\"\n\nGFW works with landowners, local communities and organizations like the Priceless Planet Coalition, created by Mastercard in partnership with Conservation International and the World Resources Institute. The coalition aims to fund the restoration of 100 million trees at sites around the world.\n\nIn an effort to sequester carbon emissions and support local economies, GFW has planted more than 7 million trees across six states - including 100,000 on this hilltop in Martin County, Kentucky, a former coal-mining site. In 2024 the coalition expanded sites globally to 22, including in the high Andes, the eastern Himalayas of India, and Thailand's Kaeng Krachan National Park, underscoring its efforts to maximize benefits on climate, communities, and biodiversity.\n\nSecuring economic stability for marginalized groups\n\nNearly 6 million small-scale fishers globally earn less than a dollar a day, often depleting fisheries in the process of trying to scrape a living from the sea. Rising ocean temperatures spurred by climate change are making their job even harder. The tech platformAbalobi helps fishers use technology to find sustainable and legal fishing spots, sell their catch to local restaurants and markets, and take out loans for better GPS-equipped boats and housing.\n\nThis year, Abalobi received a boost from the Climate Smart Innovation Hub, a program launched by the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth and the Climate Innovation for Adaptation and Resilience Alliance to connect entrepreneurs with climate scientists, financial service providers and investors to help unbanked workers become more resilient to climate change.\n\nThe hub showcased Abalobi among more than 70 banking and financial services solutions designed to drive financial resilience and promote environmental sustainability. The products serve affected populations around the world with a range of financial tools including credit, savings, payments and insurance.\n\nInclusive climate action\n\nClimate change disproportionately affects global populations that are hardest to reach - whether for geographic, administrative or social reasons. Many of these communities have developed innovative solutions that offer lessons for addressing climate challenges at scale. For example, southern Kenyan villagers are restoring mangrove forests, which capture 10 times more carbon than regular forests, and selling the carbon credits to large companies.\n\nThese \"blue economy\" projects have helped fuel a rise in prosperity in Kenya, which caught the attention of Reach Alliance. Founded in 2015 as a partnership between the University of Toronto and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, the alliance looks for development strategies for climate-vulnerable communities around the world. It's made a list of five key factors for boosting inclusive climate resilience in vulnerable communities: program sustainability, repurposing existing technology and resources, local ownership, appropriate incentives and a network of partnerships.\n\nAfter studying the mangrove projects, the Reach Alliance realized that in addition to bringing new prosperity, these projects also protect villagers against extreme weather events. Kenyans in the project areas gain a new a source of income that they invest back into their communities, thus contributing to the development of sanitation, education, health and environment in their own neighborhoods. Ultimately their better understanding of successful sustainability models opens the door to an increase in similar projects around the globe.\n\nOriginally published by Mastercard\n\nFollow along Mastercard's journey to connect and power an inclusive, digital economy that benefits everyone, everywhere.\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Mastercard on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\n\nSpokesperson: Mastercard\n\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/mastercard\n\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: Mastercard",

            "content": "The most recent trading session ended with MasterCard (MA) standing at $516.40, reflecting a +0.98% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.16%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.25%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.06%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the processor of debit and credit card payments had lost 3.33% over the past month. This has was narrower than the Business Services sector's loss of 6.27% and lagged the S&P 500's loss of 2.8% in that time.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of MasterCard in its upcoming earnings disclosure. On that day, MasterCard is projected to report earnings of $3.68 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 15.72%. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $7.4 billion, indicating a 12.97% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for MasterCard. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.02% higher. MasterCard is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at valuation, MasterCard is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 31.42. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 13.97.\n\nAlso, we should mention that MA has a PEG ratio of 2.03. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Financial Transaction Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.21 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 77, positioning it in the top 31% of all 250+ industries.",

            "content": "Another year, another dividend raise. That has been the strategy of payment card giant Mastercard (MA 1.48%) for over a decade now, and in December it maintained that tradition with another increase in its payout for stockholders. The increase was accompanied by news of a massive stock buyback program, so Mastercard will spend much of 2025 doling out capital for stock price-supporting measures.\n\nLet's unpack whether these changes support the buy case for the company.\n\nImpressive news ... at least at first glance\n\nMastercard announced this latest dividend raise in mid-December. The company said it is boosting its quarterly distribution by $0.10, or 15%, to $0.76 per share. This is to be dispensed on Feb. 7 to investors of record as of Jan. 9.\n\nA 15% increase sounds impressive on the surface, as most dividend raises from large, publicly traded companies tend to fall in the single-digit percentage range. Yet there are two factors here that make it a \"more of the same,\" situation for Mastercard.\n\nFirst, the company typically hikes its payout at low-double-digit rates. After all, it continues to work from a relatively low base -- when it initiated its dividend in 2006, its first quarterly disbursement was $0.09. Even now, at well under $1 per share, even a bump of $0.10 makes for a disproportionate leap in percentage terms.\n\nSecond, Mastercard remains a relatively miserly dividend payer. Even with the new raise, the dividend yield calculates out to less than 0.6% on the stock's most recent closing price. The average of S&P 500 index component companies is more than double that percentage, at over 1.2%.\n\nThen there is the fact that the dividend raise is eclipsed by yet another massive share buyback program launched by the company.\n\nConcurrent with the payout hike announcement, Mastercard revealed that its board of directors has approved a fresh stock repurchase initiative totaling up to $12 billion, which is $1 billion higher than the previous authorization (enacted in December 2023). That's an awful lot of buyback funding, and it will help greatly when and if the company's share price needs a boost.\n\nMassively marvelous margins\n\nMastercard has this kind of cash to throw around because its business is enormous and profitable.\n\nOne key reason for this is that, like its eternal competitor Visa, it does not provide the credit that funds the transactions on its cards. It's an \"open loop\" operator, as such companies are known in the card business, meaning that it functions only as a processor of transactions made through its networks. Banks and other companies are the ones actually providing the \"short-term loans\" for the transacting cardholders.\n\nIt's a fine middle-man business, and Mastercard is a master at it. The company's vast revenue and limited expenses result in sky-high margins; on an annual basis so far this decade, its net margin has landed consistently in the 40%-plus range.\n\nOn top of that, a global economy that's generally humming along (particularly in this country) is supporting notable revenue growth -- across the past four years alone Mastercard's top line has expanded by 64%.\n\nThe immediate future looks good, too, if recent consumer habits are any indication. 2024's Black Friday shopping holiday in the U.S. saw retailers grow sales by an average of 3.4% year over year, according to Mastercard's research arm. Not to be outdone, December's holiday season experienced an even higher rise, growing by 3.8%. Shoppers in America, an eternally crucial market for the company, are obviously eager to spend.\n\nThe dividend doesn't make all that much difference\n\nGiven that skimpy dividend yield, few investors buy Mastercard for its payout. And since a 15% bump is the rule and not the exception, the raise isn't going to make much difference to that sentiment. I'd even go so far as to say the new stock buyback program won't have a big effect either. The $12 billion repurchase amount is impressive at first glance, yes; however, if a business is weak, no amount of share self-buying is going to support its stock price.\n\nThat's why neither of these actions is crucial. What's far more relevant to investors considering Mastercard is that it is an excellent business, and it's operating in thriving economic times that will surely produce continued growth. Its valuations aren't cheap, with a five-year forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 2. In my mind, though, you have to pay up for a company of this quality, at this level of profitability. And, I'd add, considerable potential for more growth even at its monster size.",

If you're looking for a rewarding card that offers simple cash back \u2014 and don't mind using the PayPal platform \u2014 this card could make a lot of sense. Card Rating*: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n*Card Rating is based on the opinion of TPG's editors and is not influenced by the card issuer.\n\nThe PayPal Cashback Mastercard is a good cash-back card because it offers an uncomplicated 1.5% return on everything and 3% cash back when you check out with PayPal. You can also combine your earnings with PayPal offers to rack up more rewards on your purchases with the merchant. If you prioritize cash back over travel rewards, this card fits the bill.\n\nOne downside, however, is that if you're not a regular PayPal user, you'll have to go through an extra step to transfer your funds to an external account. In many cases, though, this could be worth the effort. The card has no annual fee and a recommended credit score of 580.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the PayPal Cashback Mastercard to see if it's right for you.\n\nThe information for the PayPal Cashback Mastercard has been collected independently by The Points Guy.

This is especially attractive to those who do a lot of online shopping, since PayPal is widely accepted at online retailers. Plus, you can use PayPal's QR code to pay in eligible stores in person.\n\nRAFAEL HENRIQUE/GETTY\n\nYou can also use the PayPal Rewards program to earn even more rewards on PayPal purchases.\n\nBut even when you can't use PayPal, you'll earn unlimited 1.5% cash back on all other purchases (as long as the merchant accepts Mastercard).\n\nAlthough this card does not offer lucrative category bonuses, it is a good option if you want a decent earning rate on all your purchases without having to juggle a handful of cards in your wallet.\n\nRelated: The best credit cards for online shopping\n\nRedeeming cash back on the PayPal Cashback Mastercard\n\nThe PayPal Cashback Mastercard allows you to receive cash back at any time, with no redemption minimums.\n\nFirst, rewards are available for transfer to your PayPal account within approximately three days after making an eligible purchase.\n\nTo make a transfer, you'll need to go to the \"rewards\" section of your PayPal account either online or via the PayPal app. Then you can select the amount of cash-back rewards you'd like to send to your PayPal account.\n\nKSENIYA OVCHINNIKOVA/GETTY IMAGES\n\nIf you want your rewards as true cash back in your bank account, you'll have to go through an extra step to use your cash back by transferring it to an external bank account. This is quite easy to do, but it is still a minor annoyance compared to the simplicity of other programs not tied to PayPal.\n\nRelated: 5 reasons to keep a cash-back credit card in your wallet\n\nWhich cards compete with the PayPal Cashback Mastercard?\n\nThere are other no-annual-fee, cash-back options to consider, including cards that earn more in nonbonus categories:\n\nFor additional card options, check out our full list of the best cash-back cards.\n\nRelated: 5 reasons I love the Chase Freedom Unlimited as a credit card beginner\n\nIs the PayPal Cashback Mastercard worth it?\n\nThe PayPal Cashback Mastercard is a decent (albeit no-frills) credit card for cash-back enthusiasts, especially if you're a frequent PayPayl user. If you're in the market for a cash-back card with no annual fee, this is a good option. However, if you want a welcome bonus or more benefits, you'll want to consider other cards.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe PayPal Cashback Mastercard offers valuable, straightforward rewards and functions as a good starter cash-back card for those who don't want to deal with differing earning rates and loads of complicated perks. Still, those who want to earn travel rewards or gain more valuable benefits from a credit card will want to look elsewhere.\n\nRelated: How to maximize cash back with your credit card",

Of those, only 9 percent can borrow formally, due to lack of information about their performance and absence of financial history, and this creates an enormous funding gap.\n\nQuipu bridges the information gap in the informal economy by using AI to more accurately assess the creditworthiness of these smaller enterprises through a scoring model that analyzes nontraditional data, such as mobile transaction histories, social media interactions, SMS and payment patterns, and intelligent disbursement and credit collection. It also provides a financing platform and microloans that allow these businesses to build an alternative credit score based on both financial and nonfinancial information. Through Quipu\u2019s app, customers can apply in minutes for working capital that is disbursed in less than two days.\n\nBolstering community health care in Ethiopia: IDinsight\n\nTwo decades ago, Ethiopia launched a new model for rural health care, training and deploying thousands of health extension workers to serve local communities, which has resulted in significant improvements in maternal and child health, and declines in new HIV infections and tuberculosis- and malaria-related deaths, to name a few.\n\nTo build on that success, IDinsight is partnering with Last Mile Health and Ethiopia\u2019s Ministry of Health on an AI-powered call center that the health extension workers can contact for real-time medical guidance on complex cases. The organization\u2019s AI solution will include a case management system and a question-answering service based on comprehensive Ministry of Health guidelines, providing real-time support to call center agents who will further relay critical information to the health care workers via phone, allowing them to focus on patient care and delivering high-quality health care.\n\nDelivering life-saving information to people in crisis around the world: International Rescue Committee\u2019s Signpost Project\n\nA record 120 million people are displaced worldwide by conflict, natural disaster, poverty and violence. People impacted by crisis must make critical, life-changing decisions throughout their journey to safety with limited information. In 2015, the International Rescue Committee launched the Signpost Project, which establishes digital help centers for users to find accurate and timely information, access critical services and ask direct questions to local moderators, such as, How can I access housing? Will I be able to get a temporary work permit? Can I enroll my children in school?. Signpost has nearly 30 active programs worldwide, with over 6 million Signpost users in 2024.\n\nHowever, information needs increase alongside the number of displaced people. During the 2023 crisis in Afghanistan, one Facebook post resulted in 30,000 messages within one month, overwhelming the local Signpost team of six moderators. In 2024, the IRC-led Signpost Project launched Signpost AI to enhance the delivery of critical information through AI agents and human oversight. This system aims to reduce the burden on moderators, enabling them to focus on more complex cases, while ensuring timely and accurate responses that improve access to resources and services for displaced populations globally.\n\nBuilding a hive of knowledge for beekeepers in India: Buzzworthy Ventures\n\nIndia remains a global agricultural dynamo, but one agricultural value chain lacks buzz: beekeeping. There are 400,000 small-scale beekeepers in India, many of whom struggle to sustain livelihoods, let alone enhance the economic potential of insect pollination for improving crop yields. In India, insect pollination contributes $22.52 billion a year, far exceeding the market size of honey and hive products, yet the potential remains vastly underutilized for crops essential to India\u2019s economy and nutrition.\n\nSo Buzzworthy Ventures created Beekind, an AI-driven mobile application to empower small-scale beekeepers, particularly women, small landholders, landless farmers and tribal populations in rural and marginalized communities. It provides real-time insights and predictive analytics, helping beekeepers manage their hive health, diagnoses diseases, improve honey production and adapt to changing climate conditions.\n\nClosing the health-wealth gap in the U.S.: Link Health\n\nEmergency physician Alister Martin often saw that poverty was the driving factor behind patients\u2019 visits to the emergency department. He realized that \u201cmoney as medicine\u201d\u2014helping patients access cash assistance and federal benefits \u2014 could address the root causes of poor health by closing the health-wealth gap.\n\nThis led to the creation of Link Health, a program that connects patients with unspent federal aid programs like SNAP, WIC and Lifeline to ease the financial strain that exacerbates health disparities. The AI-enabled enrollment platform and chatbot aims to unlock $10 million in state and federal benefits to alleviate poverty, reduce financial stress and improve well-being.",

            "content": "Rising credit card swipe fees are hurting Kentucky businesses and customers | Opinion As credit card usage increases, the financial burden on merchants and consumers will grow unless Congress addresses this market distortion that has left Americans paying the highest swipe fee rates.\n\nKentucky's economic health relies heavily on the prosperity of its businesses, both big and small. But with prices continuing to rise, small businesses like mine that comprise more than 99% of companies in the state, are struggling to absorb the added costs while maintaining a strong base of customers. The exorbitant cost of credit card swipe fees is one such issue plaguing Kentucky's merchants and consumers alike and passing the Credit Card Competition Act (CCCA) would help alleviate this financial pressure and promote economic development across the state.\n\nWhen you go to your local grocery store or restaurant and swipe your credit card, swipe fees are charged to the business for accepting and processing the card. Anyone who runs a company, church or charity and accepts cards for payments or donations knows how quickly these fees add up, often accounting for a higher overhead cost than providing health care to employees or paying for utilities.\n\nThese fees have also tripled in the past decade, increasing the burden on small businesses, as Visa and Mastercard rake in over $100 billion in credit card swipe fees for the first time last year. Kentucky businesses specifically are sending over $1 billion annually in these fees to Wall Street banks and major credit card companies. Unfortunately, this cost is also borne by all Kentuckians as businesses are forced to raise prices to cover increasing fees.\n\nThe cumulative result of rising swipe fees is hampering economic development in our local communities and adding to inflation, all to line the pockets of major financial institutions already bringing in record-breaking profits.\n\nThankfully, the CCCA is a commonsense, bipartisan solution to increase competition in the credit card processing industry.\n\nBreaking up the Visa and Mastercard monopoly\n\nUnder the current setup, Visa and Mastercard have a monopoly on credit cards (over 80% of the market) and they set terms and fees without competition. The CCCA would make it so that when you pay with a credit card, the business owner would have a choice of at least two networks for processing that transaction over. This small change means that credit card giants would have to compete for businesses to choose their network for processing, encouraging lower fees, better security and improved services.\n\nMajor financial institutions have tried to claim this bill is about imposing burdensome regulations or capping fees. However, this couldn't be further from the truth. This bill would give merchants the freedom to choose and create an environment where competition can thrive, leading to better outcomes for both businesses and customers.\n\nWe know fair competition results in the best quality at the lowest price and businesses across the state are forced to compete daily for customers \u2014 why shouldn't Visa and Mastercard have to do the same?\n\nReducing prices for Kentucky consumers\n\nThe advantages of the CCCA for Kentucky are clear. Reduced swipe fees would lower business operating costs, allowing for reduced consumer prices. Increasing competition would have the added benefit of driving innovation in the financial services sector. Introducing alternative networks would spur advancements such as better fraud protection, which is critically needed given that fraud rates for Visa and Mastercard are eight times higher than for their debit counterparts.\n\nAs credit card usage increases, the financial burden on merchants and consumers will continue to grow unless Congress addresses this market distortion that has left Americans paying the highest swipe fee rates in the world. The CCCA represents an opportunity to make a significant difference in the lives of Kentuckians. Doing nothing on this issue is effectively siding with mega-wealthy credit card companies that continue to levy excessive fees on Main Street businesses and local communities.\n\nLeadership from Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul on this issue could be the driving force needed to advance this critical legislation, and I hope they\u2019ll consider supporting the CCCAs passage.\n\nAgree or disagree? Submit a letter to the editor.\n\nLogan Gatti is a small business owner and an economic development strategist in Louisville.",

He explains how customer experience can drive sales, engage customers and encourage loyalty when done well.\n\nA marketing maven, Lance leads the global customer care team at Mastercard. From customer intelligence and CX to performance analytics and AI, he throws light on Mastercard\u2019s transition to a data-driven culture and brand. In this exclusive with MarTech Advisor, Lance reveals what you need to do as a customer-centric marketing leader to stay relevant in today\u2019s omnichannel, multi-device digital environment.\n\nKey takeaways from this Q&A on the importance of customer experience:\n\nInsights gained from Mastercard\u2019s CX journey\n\nTop tips on how brands can stay relevant in the customer\u2019s mind\n\nLatest trends to follow in customer experience design for 2020 and beyond\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlights of the Q&A With Lance Gruner of Mastercard\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nHere\u2019s the edited transcript of Lance\u2019s conversation with us on the importance of customer experience and more:\n\nHow have you seen the concept of \u2018customer care\u2019 evolve in the last decade or so, given the rapid evolution of both, the multi-channel, multi-device digital environment; and customer behavior and expectations from brands? What have been the biggest areas of transformation?\n\nWe are living in the \u201cexperience economy,\u201d which means customer expectations are higher than ever before. Customers are always connected and looking for immediate gratification; they also have the power to lift brands up and take them down with a single tweet.\n\nAs a result, we see a big change in both how we talk about our work and the reputation it has within the company. Our organization is now thinking holistically about the experience we give customers, whether that\u2019s through the product, after-purchase support or even in our communication.\n\nWhile \u201ccustomer care\u201d used to be thought of as a cost center, that perception is quickly changing. Of course, we\u2019ve always been working to add value and drive the brand forward, but now we have a seat at the table to make and inform strategic decisions, based on our voice of the customer and feedback loop with our internal partners. In short, customer experience is now recognized as a critical driver of brand and business value. A recent CEO study by Conference BoardOpens a new window found that \u201ccustomers place a higher value on the experience of using a product than on the product itself and CEOs see enhancing \u2018the experience\u2019 as the way to future success.\u201d\n\nWhat will be the next big transformation in the industry? The ability to assess rich data and utilize the new technologies and innovation that legitimately drives business value. It\u2019s not about having all the bells and whistles but about integrating the right technology and efficiently using data that delivers the best experience and keeping up with changing customer expectations.\n\nWhat are the typical missteps that brands make, that lead to irrelevance in the customer\u2019s mind? What practical steps could a customer-centric marketing leader take to stay relevant?\n\nIt\u2019s easy for brands to get excited about shiny new tools like chatbots and lose sight of what truly matters to the customer. Companies need to understand that there is a difference between talking about customer experience and knowing what to do about it. The biggest misstep companies make is not having a Chief Customer Officer at the leadership table or at least a senior executive who thinks about the customer 24\u00d77 and can act as their advocate throughout the organization.\n\nI used to work as a CX executive in hospitality and I always tell my team to metaphorically \u201cwalk the property\u201d like I used to do on the hotel properties that I managed. In other words: put yourself in the customer\u2019s shoes and see how your product or service lives. How does the customer use it? Does it really solve a need? We do this by encouraging product and technology owners to listen and see first-hand how our products are used. We also host multiple customer conferences globally every year to hear directly from our customers and develop tangible plans to act on that feedback.\n\nBeyond my customer care team, I am also constantly working to ensure a customer-first mindset pervades the organization. The experience of the customer must be top of mind in everything we do from designing new features to crafting technical content. Without this cultural change, all the technology and tools in the world won\u2019t matter. Customer will quickly see what companies are truly focused on the customer.\n\nLearn More: Why Customer Experience Matters Even More in 2019: Q&A with Matt Zilli of Marketo, An Adobe Company\n\nStaying engaged with the customer through their journey and delivering delightful customer experience (CX) is an imperative today. What are the basic principles Mastercard follows when it comes to Customer Experience design?\n\nA great experience is the culmination of every interaction we have with a customer. Therefore, our team\u2019s North Star centers on something we call, \u201cone view for the customer.\u201d Our customers today are using multiple communication channels, both personally and professionally, that\u2019s why we strive to think about every touchpoint and how it contributes to creating a holistic experience with our brand. \u201cOne view for the customer\u201d means we turn the telescope around and not think of our view of customers, but rather, how they see us from sales through service.\n\nUltimately, this enables us to effectively respond to their requests more quickly and helps us set the right expectations about how we can and can\u2019t help. While internally we may have several platforms that support our interactions with our customers, it is essential that from the customer\u2019s perspective, they have a single source of truth and get what they\u2019re looking for when they contact us.\n\nWhich tools/technology helped you to map customer engagement and focus on creating a customer-centric culture?\n\nAs a company with top-tier technology at its core, we have the technical talent to build and use some of the best tools and technology out there. Every stitch of technology we use boils down to three goals:\n\nNeed: the extent does it help someone do something Ease: the degree of simplicity to accomplish a goal Emotion: how the interactions makes someone feel\n\n\n\nMore specifically, we\u2019re doing some exciting work with predictive analytics tools, which help us stay one step ahead of customers. As we put new products and enhancements into the market, predictive analytics helps to ensure we have the right amount of support in place to address customers\u2019 needs in a timely fashion and exceed their expectations. It also helps with forecasting the volume of inquiries so that we can resource accordingly. And because we have a better sense of what customer support skills are most in-demand, this technology has also informed how we train employees and help them skill up.\n\nWhat have been your biggest learnings about transitioning to a data-driven decision-making culture at Mastercard?\n\nThe pace of technology innovation and the amount of data available to us today. Our industry will see more AI and CX tools emerge in the next five years than in the previous 20. Speech and text analytics, chatbots, AI, biometrics, all these developments are impacting both how our customers interact with us and how we leverage insights about our customers.\n\nHowever, all companies hit a spot where they must learn that it\u2019s not about the data, you\u2019re adding to your customer relationship management (CRM) platform but how you\u2019re organizing and using it. If the data organization doesn\u2019t allow you to be more sophisticated, give predictive analytics and act non-intrusively, then why bother with the cost of energy\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget, we are in an omnichannel revolution. Customers want to choose the channel easiest for them to reach out to us. And while it\u2019s a very exciting time to look at what all we can do to elevate our customer\u2019s journey through data-driven decision-making, we can\u2019t forget that the goal is always to make our connection with the customer better. It\u2019s important to always go back to the basics, simplify their experience, make their journey frictionless, and then measure and execute based on continuous feedback.\n\nLearn More: Data-Driven Marketing Trends for the AI Age: Q&A With Palace Resorts\u2019 VP of Global Marketing, Kathy Halpern\n\nNeha: Thank you, Lance, for sharing your insights on the importance of customer experience strategies.

            "content": "AI has been transforming the marketing industry and Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing and communications officer at Mastercard, is here for it.\n\nHe says the industry has already seen AI transforming functions like content creation and digital search but that is just the tip of the iceberg. Rajamannar says that marketing is on the precipice of a major shift this year with the technology\u2019s next breakthrough: agentic AI.\n\n\u201cAI continues to reshape the marketing landscape in groundbreaking ways. We began with AI, progressed to Generative AI, and are now entering the next transformative phase: agentic AI. This is the game changer,\u201d explains Rajamannar. \u201cUnlike traditional or Generative AI, where you ask for answers and then act on them yourself, agentic AI takes care of everything\u2014from providing recommendations to executing tasks on your behalf. For instance, instead of merely suggesting the best flight options, the AI agent will book them for you.\u201d\n\nMastercard is known for its customer-centric service from its 24/7 concierge to its priceless experiences.\n\n\u201cThis shift has profound implications for the convenience of consumers and how they delegate decision-making to AI,\u201d adds Rajamannar. \u201cFor marketers, it\u2019s imperative to adapt, remain relevant and find ways to integrate into this evolving purchase funnel. In 2025 and into the future, brands must ensure they are the preferred brand\u2014not only for consumers but for their AI agents.\u201d\n\nRajamannar will be speaking at the Brand Innovators Marketing Leadership Summit at CES at 10:40 on Tuesday morning.\n\nPrior to joining Mastercard more than 12 years ago, Rajamannar held senior leadership roles at WellPoint, Humana and Citigroup. Brand Innovators caught up with him to discuss CES, 2025 predictions and Shopping Muse, Mastercard\u2019s AI-powered assistant. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat will the brand\u2019s Priceless platform look like in the New Year and what does this mean for the consumer experience?\n\nMore exciting than ever! Priceless is a platform that is both timeless and yet constantly evolving. We\u2019re always looking for the next big opportunity to deliver the most relevant and extraordinary experiences, and we forged some incredible new partnerships that will help us deliver on this in 2025.\n\nLive music, for example, is a growing passion among people worldwide. Our partnership with Live Nation allows us to provide cardholders across Asia Pacific and Europe with exclusive access to presale tickets, premium seating, and VIP experiences that are truly unforgettable. In the U.S., we\u2019ve expanded our music-related offerings through partnerships with iconic venues and festivals, such as The Capitol Theatre in New York and Moody Center in Austin, enhancing access to incredible live performances.\n\nSimilarly, our new partnership with McLaren Racing taps into the surging global excitement around Formula 1, with one in three fans joining the sport within the past four years. Through this collaboration, we\u2019re bringing unique, immersive experiences to motorsport enthusiasts, helping fans get even closer to what they love.\n\nWhat loyalty benefits will consumers be looking for in 2025?\n\nI firmly believe that traditional brand loyalty is becoming a thing of the past. I\u2019ve long argued that brand loyalty is dead because \u2013at a fundamental level \u2013 humans aren\u2019t loyal to brands. Instead, consumers expect brands to be loyal to them. Loyalty is not a one-way street. It\u2019s about building strong, meaningful relationships.\n\nIn the years ahead, we will shift away from the concept of loyalty and instead focus on creating personalized, fluid experiences that foster long-term trust. Maintaining that trust will be essential, becoming the cornerstone of successful brand-to-consumer interactions. To do this, we must deliver the right content in the right way, at the right time, while continuously enhancing their experiences to nurture and build trust.\n\nCan you talk about how you are using AI at Mastercard today for personalization, like with your Shopping Muse and Small Business AI tools?\n\nWe\u2019re leveraging AI in innovative ways to transform both consumer and business experiences. These tools enhance effectiveness and allow us to connect with people in personalized and resonant ways.\n\nOne example is Shopping Muse, an AI-powered assistant designed to redefine online shopping. It converts everyday language into personalized product suggestions and curated bundles. Imagine asking a chatbot, \u201cShow me dresses for a wedding in Charleston with a black-tie dress code,\u201d and receiving tailored recommendations that perfectly fit your request. This technology makes online shopping feel as personalized as visiting a boutique. Already adopted by popular brands like Belk, H&M, Michael Kors and Hugo Boss, Shopping Muse was created to meet growing consumer demand for seamless, intuitive experiences.\n\nWe\u2019ve also recently launched our Small Business AI tool, a chatbot tailored to support small business owners. With over 90% of small business owners acknowledging that mentorship improves their chances of success but only 25% having access to it, this tool democratizes mentorship. It simplifies the information-gathering process by offering easy-to-digest resources. For creators, we are providing pay transparency insights, helping them navigate fair compensation in the gig economy.\n\nAI\u2019s potential is extraordinary, and when used responsibly, it can deepen our connections with consumers and businesses in transformative ways.",

People are choosing to invest in experiences that bring personal fulfillment and lasting memories. We\u2019re excited to bring cardholders closer to their growing passion for entertainment through this partnership with Netflix, offering them exclusive access to unique and immersive experiences.\u201d\n\nAs Netflix\u2019s preferred payments provider and partner, Mastercard will support major in-person experiences like Netflix Bites, \u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow,\u201d and Netflix House, all debuting in 2025.\n\nDuring the second pop-up of Netflix Bites, fans, and food enthusiasts will be treated to an unforgettable dining journey inspired by the popular Netflix series.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best January Dividend Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other January dividend stocks.\n\nIn 2024, dividend stocks fell short of investor expectations, largely due to the continuing AI boom and a heightened interest in technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrats index lagged behind the broader market during the year. However, analysts remain optimistic about the future of dividend equities. This positive sentiment is driven by the fact that many US companies have ample cash reserves to sustain their dividend payments. The Wells Fargo Investment Institute reported that large-cap US companies have amassed over $2.4 trillion in cash, which could be used to either start or enhance dividend payouts.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best Performing Dividend ETFs In 2024\n\nDespite the lack of enthusiasm for dividend stocks, analysts believe they still offer attractive entry points for investors. Capital Group suggested seeking opportunities in dividend-paying companies that the market has overlooked. This includes pharmaceutical firms that have been neglected due to the current focus on weight loss treatments, as well as utilities and certain banks. Within the dividend space, investors are increasingly drawn toward dividend growth stocks that offer consistent yields. Stocks that pay dividends and boast solid balance sheets with attractive yields can provide reliable income, protect against market declines, and support healthy investment growth. A report by ProShares highlighted that since its inception, the Dividend Aristocrats Index has outperformed the broader market with less volatility. For instance, a $10,000 investment in May 2005 could have grown to over $61,000 by March 2023.\n\nThe report also mentioned that the index has demonstrated strong performance in both up and down markets, with an upside capture of 91% and a downside capture of 80%. It has shown notable resilience during market downturns, outperforming the wider market by more than 12% in 2022. In addition, the Dividend Aristocrats Index has outpaced the market in eight of the 10 worst quarterly declines since 2005.\n\nSince the start of 2025, the broader market has only seen a modest increase of 0.66%. In this environment, UBS has identified stocks that are considered high quality compared to their peers and are unlikely to reduce their current dividend payouts. The firm estimates a 22.9% chance of dividend cuts across various regions and sectors, noting that the US remains the most secure region for dividends, with only a 6.2% likelihood of cuts. Moreover, most sectors in the US appear relatively stable. Japan stands out as the most favorable region for dividend growth, with a projected growth rate of 9.9%.\n\nThat said, investing in dividend stocks can be more complex than it seems, requiring thorough analysis. Although dividends are often linked to long-term returns, some investors employ a short-term strategy known as dividend capture. This approach involves purchasing shares just before a company pays its dividend and selling them soon after the dividend is received. The objective is to collect the dividend income while possibly benefiting from a rise in the stock\u2019s price leading up to the dividend announcement. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks to buy in January.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nThe following list provides details on the dividend capture strategy, focusing on the selection of prominent dividend-paying stocks set to go ex-dividend in January 2025. The ex-dividend date marks the final day to buy a stock and qualify for its upcoming dividend. The list is ranked chronologically, with earlier dates appearing first and later dates following in order. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)\n\nEx-Dividend Date: January 9\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is an American credit card company that offers a wide range of payment processing and related services to its consumers. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 24%. The payment processing giant has impressed investors with its strong growth, significant competitive advantage, and resilience against economic challenges. The company primarily earns revenue through swipe fees, averaging just over 2% for each transaction processed from co-branded cards. This straightforward business model is consistently reliable, thriving during economic upturns and protecting the company from credit risks during downturns.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) reported revenue of $7.37 billion, which saw a 13% growth from the same period last year. The results reflect strong consumer spending and sustained demand for the company\u2019s value-added services and solutions. The company\u2019s cash position also remained very strong. It ended the quarter with over $11 billion available in cash and cash equivalents, up from $8.6 billion at the end of December 2023. In addition, the company\u2019s operating cash flow came in at nearly $10 billion, growing from $7.8 billion in the prior-year period.\n\nMontaka Global Investments made the following comment about MA in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMontaka owns several duopolists in the financial services industry, including Visa and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in payments; and S&P Global in credit ratings and financial data services. These businesses have competitively protected and reliably growing core businesses. But they also have newer, high-probability adjacent opportunities. The market, however, is underappreciating this powerful combination, in our view. For Visa and Mastercard, their core businesses in global payment processing are being complemented by significant growth in two areas: New processing opportunities in peer-to-peer, business-to-business, business-to-consumer, and government-to-consumer payments; and Value-added services, including risk, fraud-detection, issuance, acceptance, and open banking.\u201d\n\nOn December 17, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) declared a 15% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.76 per share. This marked the company\u2019s 13th consecutive year of dividend growth. As of January 5, the stock has a dividend yield of 0.58%.\n\nAs of the close of Q3 2024, 131 hedge funds held investments in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), down from 142 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a total value of more than $17 billion. With over 4.1 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall MA ranks 9th on our list of the best January dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Payments Trends Tech trends and trust: Making Southeast Asia\u2019s digital economy work for all January 6, 2025 | By Safdar Khan\n\nThis article was first published in The Business Times.\n\nSome key trends \u2013 and building consumer trust \u2013 will shape the banking and payments sector in the region in 2025\n\nSouth-east Asia has seen a confluence of factors in recent years that have driven incredible economic transformation: the rapid growth of the digital economy, and subsequent hyper-acceleration of digitisation through the pandemic.\n\nThe region\u2019s gross transaction value for digital payments is expected to exceed US$1 trillion in 2025. Alternative payment methods, from digital wallets to QR code payments, have reshaped the marketplace, offering consumers more choice and convenience while ushering in a new era of innovation.\n\nLooking ahead, there are some key trends that will shape the banking and payments sector in South-east Asia in 2025.\n\nFrom the growing use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to the need for innovative solutions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the ever-pressing demand for advanced cybersecurity, these trends will mean significant technological change in a region where large parts of the population are still digitally disconnected and may find it difficult to adapt.\n\nWe stand at something of a crossroads. How can these innovations and technologies be thoughtfully implemented so that they offer the broad-based, tangible benefits and opportunities that they have the potential to unlock?\n\nRise of generative AI in banking\n\nGenerative AI is making waves across the banking sector, thanks to advances in technology, rising demand for personalised experiences, and supportive regulatory frameworks.\n\nSome banks in the region are already using AI to streamline operations and foster new customer engagement channels \u2013 for instance, by training proprietary large language models to drive faster regulatory compliance, offer more responsive customer service, and improve access to product information.\n\nBuilding on these advancements, generative AI could also democratise access to financial services, promoting greater economic equity.\n\nBy integrating bank accounts, investment portfolios, and small business accounts \u2013 and even engaging with governmental revenue offices \u2013 AI has the potential to act as a personal wealth management assistant.\n\nImagine an AI-driven platform that not only guides users through loan procurement but also implements complex financial strategies typically out of reach for the average investor.\n\nBuilding consumer trust will help to enable these equity-focused technologies to thrive, and so the ethical use of AI needs to be of paramount importance. As institutions develop these capabilities, transparency around technology implementation and data usage will be essential to secure the buy-in needed to maintain customer confidence.\n\nDemand from SMEs to drive new acceptance and financing options\n\nGiven that SMEs make up 99 per cent of all businesses in South-east Asia and account for over 90 per cent of employment, it\u2019s essential to foster confidence through providing accessible payment solutions and credit options.\n\nAccording to data from Mastercard\u2019s global network, the period between 2018 and 2022 saw a 12 per cent increase in SME transactions through payment facilitators such as third-party platforms GrabPay and Doku.\n\nIn South-east Asia, an increasing number of small businesses are looking to implement or expand their acceptance of digital payments, and they\u2019re seeking options that match their needs for scalability, speed and affordability.\n\nMobile-based point-of-sale technology will play an important role here. One example is FOMO SoftPOS in Singapore, a cloud-based solution which allows merchants to accept contactless payments easily using virtually any Android device via near-field communication.\n\nWhen developing acceptance solutions for small businesses, financial providers should emphasise straightforward processes and lighter infrastructure requirements to deliver tangible benefits to SMEs.\n\nDespite being significant drivers of economic growth, roughly 60 per cent of micro SMEs in the region face challenges obtaining loans from traditional financial institutions.\n\nGiven that traditional loans often come with high interest rates or strict credit requirements, financial institutions could look to develop more SME-friendly options.\n\nNew card-based loans and \u201cfungible\u201d credit lines offer flexibility, giving SMEs the liquidity they need to manage everyday expenses without burdensome, high-interest debt.\n\nFor instance, CIMB Malaysia\u2019s SME BusinessCard allows small businesses to pay supplier invoices, payroll, and utilities \u2013 beneficiaries who don\u2019t typically have card acceptance capabilities \u2013 via digital payments platform EzyPayment, enabling SMEs to extend their cashflow at a cost-effective rate.\n\nBy providing new ways to access funds, these innovations meet SMEs\u2019 needs while building their trust in the financial system\u2019s responsiveness \u2013 and retaining them in the system. This could also enable financial institutions to engage better with the largely untapped SME market.\n\nGreater need for advanced cybersecurity\n\nCybercrime is escalating at an alarming rate in the region. Data from Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Defence indicates that the number of such incidents in South-east Asia increased by a staggering 82 per cent between 2021 and 2022. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that the cyber-enabled fraud industry in South-east Asia generates between US$27.4 billion and US$36.5 billion annually.\n\nIn response, financial institutions are stepping up investment in security, deploying AI-driven fraud detection, biometric authentication, and advanced encryption.\n\nIn a digital landscape with an increasing number of entry points, advanced cybersecurity measures will be necessary.\n\nOn its part, Mastercard has invested US$7 billion in cybersecurity capabilities since 2018 and contributed to the launch of more than 20 cybersecurity-focused startups. Recently, we have started deploying new generative AI technology that scans one trillion data points to predict whether a transaction is likely to be genuine or not.\n\nBut in the world of cybersecurity, no man (or company) is an island, and so fostering trust in the digital economy is going to require more collaboration between all stakeholders. There needs to be a united front in tackling these challenges to build trust and participation in the ecosystem \u2013 not just for the safety of individuals and businesses, but ultimately for the integrity of the entire system.\n\nAdvancing the digital economy\n\nThese advancements are transforming how commerce is being conducted in South-east Asia, but for them to reach their full potential, a balance will need to be struck.\n\nTrust will need to play a pivotal role in their adoption. From AI-driven banking to mobile-first digital payments, every innovation must prioritise the user experience without compromising on privacy or security.\n\nIt\u2019s only by ensuring that trust is central in these new technologies and innovations that they can be widely accepted and truly beneficial to everyone, living up to the promise of an inclusive, transparent and resilient digital economy.",

            "content": "[Editor\u2019s Note: This story was updated on Jan. 6, 2025 to include sales figures from Salesforce.]\n\nThe presents are unwrapped, trees are out on the curb and the final sales numbers are rolling in for the 2024 holiday season, which delivered the growth that had been predicted. Preliminary numbers from Mastercard and Visa indicate that sales increased 3.8% and 4.8%, respectively, from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Both Visa and Mastercard measure in-store and online sales for all payment types in their analysis.\n\nBoth sets of data also showed a marked increase in online spending, with Mastercard reporting a 6.7% bump in online sales year-over-year and Visa reporting a 7.1% increase in online shopping. At the same time, in-person shopping and spending also saw gains, with Mastercard remarking on what it called consumers\u2019 \u201cbalanced basket\u201d: restaurant spending grew 6.3% year-over-year alongside gains in hard goods categories apparel (3.6%), jewelry (4%) and electronics (3.7%).\n\n\u201cThis holiday shopping season, we\u2019re seeing increasing consumer confidence as people sought out in-store experiences \u2014 and went online \u2014 to purchase gifts and celebrate the holidays with friends and family,\u201d said Wayne Best, Chief Economist at Visa in a statement. \u201cThis spending growth demonstrates the adaptability of both consumers and retailers and the overall strength of the economy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSalesforce also has released its holiday results, reporting that sales surged to a record $1.2 trillion globally and $282 billion in the U.S. These numbers are higher than Salesforce originally predicted; the company said that growth was driven by surges in mobile and social commerce alongside increases in spending after consumers spent the first half of 2024 saving.\n\nMalls Win Big Amid Shortened Shopping Season\n\nAccording to Visa, 77% of total payment volume took place in stores this year versus 23% online, with total retail spend in stores growing 4.1% (versus 1.6% last year). One of the biggest recipients of all that IRL shopping this year was malls. In fact, insights from foot traffic intelligence platform Placer.ai found that visits to indoor malls on Super Saturday (the last Saturday before Christmas, which fell on Dec. 21 in 2024) increased a whopping 177.1% compared to 2024\u2019s year-to-date daily average. Visitsto outlet malls and to open-air shopping centers also saw marked increases of 192.1% and 105.8%, respectively, compared to 2024 daily averages.\n\nIn fact, the last five days of the holiday shopping season, which includes Super Saturday, accounted for 10% of all spending, according to Mastercard \u2014 indicating a rash of last-minute spending that wasn\u2019t unexpected, given the shortened shopping window between Thanksgiving and Christmas 2024.\n\nAlso in line with expectations, consumers sought out value this year, reported Mastercard, with promotions driving sales throughout the season.\n\n\u201cThe holiday shopping season revealed a consumer who is willing and able to spend but driven by a search for value, as can be seen by concentrated ecommerce spending during the biggest promotional periods,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, Chief Economist at the Mastercard Economics Institute in a statement. \u201cSolid spending during this holiday season underscores the strength we observed from the consumer all year, supported by the healthy labor market and household wealth gains.\u201d\n\nFraud and Returns Increase Along with Sales\n\nIn tandem with these spending increases both fraud and returns also saw gains. Visa said that during the 2024 Black Friday-Cyber Monday weekend it blocked nearly double the amount of suspected fraud versus 2023. And Loop Returns reported that return volumes again increased this year, albeit at a lower rate than they increased in 2023, climbing 5.7% in 2024 versus a 16.2% increase in 2023.\n\nSalesforce numbers paint an even more dire picture with that company\u2019s data indicating that more than $122 billion of global purchases have already been returned, up 28% from last holiday season. The company predicts that this number will grow to $133 billion as holiday returns continue to trickle in.",

            "content": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nView our latest analysis for Mastercard\n\nMastercard's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that Mastercard's EPS has grown 18% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Mastercard maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 12% to US$27b. That's encouraging news for the company!\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\n\nNYSE:MA Earnings and Revenue History January 5th 2025\n\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Mastercard's future profits.\n\nAre Mastercard Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of Mastercard, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$177m. We note that this amounts to 0.04% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Mastercard but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.",

            "content": "The two biggest global network payment processors are Visa and Mastercard. A recent severe setback for both publicly traded corporations came when an American judge ordered them to reimburse cardholders a staggering $197 million. Based on the information that is currently accessible, an American court ordered VISA and Mastercard to reimburse the money that was taken out of their users\u2019 and customers\u2019 cards earlier this year under the guise of higher fees.\n\nVisa and Mastercard users will receive a $1,797 direct payment soon\n\nIn its ruling, the US court declared the extra fees that the two businesses were collecting from their customers unlawful. According to sources, as part of the settlement, Mastercard will return $92.8 million to cardholders, while Visa will pay $104.6 million to its customers. When using a Visa or Mastercard to withdraw cash from an ATM in the United States, additional fees must be paid. According to the court\u2019s verdict, the additional fee was unlawful, and Visa and Mastercard were forced to reimburse the money.\n\nIn the $197 million settlement, customers who have taken out cash from bank-run ATMs since 2007 are involved. It is important to note that not every Mastercard and Visa user will receive a refund. The two conditions for a refund are:\n\nBetween October 1, 2007, and July 26, 2024, cardholders who used a Visa or Mastercard debit card at an ATM in the United States paid a non-refundable surcharge.\n\nBanks like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, or Bank of America that are part of the VISA or Mastercard ATM network are required to levy fees.\n\nAccording to the information provided, Visa charges the card issuer either based on the volume of the card or each transaction. However, Mastercard charges card-issuing institutions according to the percentage of global dollar volume, which is the total volume of all card transactions over a given period.\n\nWhich steps should users follow to request claims regarding their payments?\n\nTo request the reimbursement, beneficiaries should go to the official class action website, fill out the online form, or download it and submit it to ATM Surcharge Settlement. Provide your contact information and sign an oath indicating that you paid excessive surcharges, as this document is legally enforceable and must be accurate. Even if you don\u2019t have to provide any papers right away, the claims administrator can ask you for more proof later on.\n\nFinally, consumers who wish to receive the Visa and Mastercard settlement payment should be aware of a few crucial dates. First, January 22nd was designated as the claim filing deadline, and January 24th was the day of the final hearing to finalize the settlement. Remember that you must complete the application by the deadline to ensure your participation in the refund.\n\nThe US has accused Visa of debit card monopoly\n\nVisa is being sued in the US for allegedly illegally suppressing competition to keep a monopoly on the debit card market. Visa was accused of penalizing businesses that attempted to utilize other payment networks and bribing possible rivals to maintain its market dominance. According to the Department of Justice, the actions have hindered innovation and resulted in hefty extra costs for American companies and consumers. The action against Visa is the most recent one brought by the Biden administration, which has addressed monopolistic issues\u2014known as antitrust in the US\u2014more forcefully than other administrations.\n\nIn other regions of the world, such as Europe and Australia, the company\u2019s activities have also been the subject of lawsuits and investigations from competition authorities and merchants. The complaint claims that the business processes over 60% of debit transactions in the US and generates $7 billion in fees yearly. In terms of revenue, its debit card division outperformed its credit card division in 2022 and was very lucrative.",

Right from the start, Kandy conceded a penalty when Dinal Ekenayake was penalised for a holding on infringement, allowing Samuel Maduwantha to convert the penalty and open the scoring. (Havelocks 03 \u2013 00 Kandy)\n\nThe Havelocks handed Kandy a numerical advantage when Dinupa Senevirathna was shown a yellow card for a deliberate knock-on. Kandy seized the opportunity, launching a clinical attack that culminated in a series of quick passes. The move ended with Tharinda Ratwatte crossing under the posts, and he made no mistake in adding the extras to put Kandy in the lead. (Havelocks 03 \u2013 07 Kandy)\n\nKandy continued to attack, utilizing their experienced backs, but a high looped pass from Shahid Zumri was expertly read by Jayathu Rajarathne. Taking a gamble, he intercepted the ball and sprinted 70 meters untouched to score under the posts, with Samuel Maduwantha adding the extras. (Havelocks 10 \u2013 07 Kandy)\n\nHavelocks found their rhythm, but despite sustained pressure, they settled for points after Kandy were penalized for offside. Maduwantha kicked his second penalty to give Havelocks a six-point lead. Kandy\u2019s situation worsened when Kavindu Perera was shown a straight red card for a high, dangerous tackle on the Havelocks scrum-half Mohmad Rifan after the restart. (Havelocks 13 \u2013 07 Kandy)\n\nDown a man, Kandy came close to scoring but were unable to finish. However, they got a chance just outside the 40-meter mark, and Tharinda Ratwatte split the uprights to close the gap. In the final move of the half, Havelocks earned an offside penalty and opted for the corner. A well-executed set play saw Shem Mendis collect the lineout and pass to No. 8 Chatura Dilshan, who shifted to the short side and offloaded to Asmir Fajudeen. Fajudeen powered over the Kandy winger to score in the corner, with Maduwantha converting from the touchline to cap a perfect half for the home side.\n\nHalf Time: Havelocks SC 20 (2T,2C,2P) \u2013 Kandy SC 10 (1T,1C,1P)\n\nPark Club came out strong after the break, but a moment of indiscipline from the experienced Senal Deelaka, who gave back-chat to the referee, earned him a yellow card. Havelocks were fortunate, however, as Shahid Zumri\u2019s subsequent penalty attempt was missed. With the numerical advantage gone, Havelocks\u2019 defence was tested, particularly by Kandy\u2019s forwards, who put in a solid performance. The visitors\u2019 rolling maul functioned well, and they repeatedly kicked for the corner. This pressure eventually paid off as Mohamed Akeel powered over from a driving maul, bringing Kandy back within three points. Nigel Ratwatte successfully converted the try. (Havelocks 20 \u2013 17 Kandy)\n\nKandy came on strong as Havelocks continued to concede possession regularly. Samuel Maduwantha attempted a 54-meter penalty, but it fell just short. Havelocks\u2019 troubles deepened when Dinanda Wickramarchchi was shown a yellow card, leveling things up in the final five minutes. Kandy kept up the pressure, using their forwards to drive close to the line. Nigel Ratwatte then shifted the play, sending a long pass to winger Dinal Ekanayake, who finished the move to secure the win. Ratwatte added the conversion, completing a fabulous comeback for Kandy.\n\nFull Time: Havelocks SC 20 (2T,2C,2P) \u2013 Kandy SC 24 (3T,3C,1P)\n\nPlayer of the Match: Tharindu Chathuranga (Kandy SC)",

            "content": "Visa and MasterCard users: you\u2019re in luck. Recently, the US courts have decided that the fees we have been paying for years for using their cards are unfair, so these companies are going to be forced to refund a huge sum of money to their users as compensation for these undue charges they have been making for years. Here we are going to tell you everything you need to know to claim your share of the compensation.\n\nWhere does the conflict come from?\n\nIt turns out that for years users have had to pay extra money as a fee for withdrawing cash from ATMs. After much debate, the court decided that these fees were illegal and that they affected consumers as unjustified costs, and that is, they were charging you money for using your own money!\n\nWho is going to receive the money?\n\nThose users who used Visa or Mastercard debit cards and were forced to pay non-refundable fees between October 1, 2007 and July 26, 2024, and another requirement is that the fee must have been charged by an ATM network such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo or Bank of America. So, if you think you could qualify for this refund (because we understand that you will not remember if you were charged something for 14 years or not), ask to follow the process that each bank will have prepared. It is expected that this process will be transparent and fast for all users.\n\nWhat does the agreement entail?\n\nUsers who meet the criteria mentioned above will be refunded a percentage equal to how much they paid of the $197 million that the Court will force these two companies to pay.\n\nIt should be noted that the distribution of refunds is not 50/50 for each company, but Visa will be forced to return $104.6 million to its customers and Mastercard will return $92.8 million to those affected by the use of its cards.\n\nThis decision puts into focus the debate that these fees had been a fairly considerable source of income for both companies, but consumer advocates (and consumers) were totally against it. Now, at last, they have managed to eliminate these usage fees.\n\nHow did the fees work?\n\nVery simple, each company had a different way of charging. Visa charged cardholders a fee based on the volume of their use, so those who used the card the most during the estimated date would receive the most. Mastercard charged issuing institutions a percentage of the total volume of transactions carried out globally.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for users?\n\nAffected users will have to wait for a notification from their banks that will tell them how to proceed.\n\nTo claim your refund, it may be important to find or keep documents that prove that these transactions have been made, so you\u2019ll have to visit the bank!\n\nFor now, this case has set a historic precedent in the regulation of bank fees, and more importantly, in the protection of consumer rights, and it may also be the first step towards investigating other financial practices that have also been going on for years.\n\nFor the future, it will be important (and as advice for everyone) that before starting to use a service we are fully aware of what said service will give us (or take away in this case), because luck will not smile on us twice.\n\n197 million dollars is a victory for consumers who had been affected by these unfair fees, and this only reinforces the need for financial transactions to be as transparent as possible. It is important not to remain silent in the face of this type of injustice and the first step has already been taken. Now, let\u2019s enjoy this victory.",

The rate may be as low as 0%, and promotional periods typically last six to 12 months.\n\nTransferring your balance from one card to another allows you to take advantage of a lower rate for a set period of time. Lower rates keep your balance from growing as quickly.\n\nIf you can pay off your balance before the balance transfer card\u2019s introductory rate ends, you may be able to save a substantial amount of interest. Because of this, balance transfer cards can actually be a tool for debt reduction.\n\nBalance transfer credit cards often charge a fee to move your balance, however, so it\u2019s important to crunch the numbers to make sure you\u2019ll actually come out ahead.\n\nWhat is a 0% balance transfer credit card?\n\nSome balance transfer credit cards offer an interest rate of 0% during the promotional period. That means a balance transferred to that card won\u2019t accrue any interest during the intro period, making it easier to pay off.\n\nHow do balance transfers work?\n\nTo transfer your balance from one credit card (usually with a higher interest rate) to a card offering a more attractive introductory rate, you\u2019ll first need to apply for the new card.\n\nOnce approved, you will then request a balance transfer, listing the amount of the balance you\u2019d like to move, along with other personal and account information.\n\nWhen the transfer is approved, you will see the balance removed from the original card and added to the new card.\n\nKeep in mind that any balance left after the promotional period ends will be subject to the regular interest rate \u2014 which is often much higher than the promotional rate.\n\nHow much can I save with a balance transfer?\n\nIf you carry a large balance on your credit card from month to month, transferring it to a credit card with a lower rate can result in significant savings, especially if you resist the urge to add new purchases, and instead focus on paying off the balance during the promotional period.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you have a balance of $5,000 on a credit card with a 20% APR and you\u2019re approved for a balance transfer card that will charge 0% interest on that balance for the first 12 months, plus a transfer fee of 3%.\n\nIf you move your balance to the new card and pay it off during the promotional period, your only cost will be the transfer fee of $150, whereas paying it off your old card over those same 12 months would have cost you $550, for overall savings of $400.\n\nActual savings will depend on many factors, including your current monthly payment amounts, your planned payment amounts on the new card, timing and card terms.\n\nHow to compare balance transfer credit cards\n\nNot all balance transfer cards are created equal. To compare cards and find a balance transfer offer that works best for your situation, consider:\n\nThe length of the introductory or promotional period (typically six to 12 months).\n\nThe regular interest rate (after the promotional period ends).\n\nAny minimum or maximum transfer amounts.\n\nAny balance transfer fee.\n\nAny annual fee.\n\nOther benefits or perks of the card.\n\nOther qualification criteria.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at these factors to help you consider which balance transfer card is best for you.\n\nCompare credit card balance transfer promotional periods\n\nBalance transfer credit cards offer their promotional interest rates for a set period of time, which vary in length from card to card. For example, BMO AIR MILES\u00ae\u2020 Mastercard\u00ae* offers an introductory interest rate of 0.99% on balance transfers for nine months, while the Tangerine World Mastercard\u00ae offers a 1.95% promotional balance transfer interest rate for the first six months.\n\nBefore applying for a balance transfer credit card, it\u2019s important to be aware of the promotional period so you can choose one that matches well with your plans to repay the balance. It\u2019s a good idea to review your budget to make sure it can accommodate the monthly payments required to pay off your debt by the end of the promotional period. That\u2019s because any balance left at the end of the period will be subject to the card\u2019s regular interest rate, which might be no better than that of your current card.\n\nHow does the 0% interest period work?\n\nSome credit cards advertise interest-free balance transfers. These 0% interest offers sound attractive, and they can help you save money, as long as you understand how they work. During the interest-free period, you won\u2019t be charged any interest on the balance you transfer (though you\u2019ll still likely pay a transfer fee). After the 0% promotional period, any remaining balance will be subject to the card\u2019s regular interest rate \u2014 which may be much higher.\n\nKnow the issuer\u2019s balance transfer rules\n\nWhen considering a balance transfer credit card, be aware of the terms and conditions associated with the transfer, including any limits on eligibility and how much you can transfer. For example, the CIBC Select Visa Card will allow you to transfer up to 50% of your assigned credit limit.\n\nIn addition, issuers don\u2019t usually allow balance transfers between their own cards.\n\nFinally, unlike purchases, balance transfers aren\u2019t eligible for an interest-free grace period. That means your transferred balance will be subject to interest right away \u2014 unless you have a 0% promotional rate.\n\nConsider the impact of annual fees\n\nLike many credit cards, some balance transfer credit cards come with annual fees, which will affect the overall cost of the balance transfer. However, it\u2019s one more important point of comparison, and depending on the amount you\u2019re transferring, paying an annual fee may be worthwhile to get a lower interest rate or transfer fee. In addition, some cards may waive the annual fee during the promotional period.\n\nCompare balance transfer fees\n\nCard issuers may charge fees for balance transfers, usually in the range of 2% to 3% of the amount you\u2019re transferring. This fee is usually added to the amount you transfer, so you\u2019ll start out with a slightly higher balance than before the transfer.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to consider this fee before applying for a new card. It\u2019s one of the numbers you\u2019ll need to review as you determine the total cost of the transfer and whether you\u2019ll be saving money over the long run.\n\nLet\u2019s consider a simplified example in which you transfer that $5,000 balance from your card with a 20% APR to a card offering a 0% interest rate for the first 12 months.\n\nIf the balance transfer fee is 1%, it means you\u2019ll start with a new balance of $5,050. But if the new card charges a 5% balance transfer fee, your new balance will be $5,250 \u2014 and that additional fee will eat into your potential interest savings, especially if you\u2019re planning to pay off your balance quickly.\n\nDetermine whether you qualify\n\nQualifying a low rate on a balance transfer credit card isn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\nTo be eligible for the lower interest rates offered by most balance transfer credit cards, your account with your current credit card must be in good standing. A strong credit score will increase your likelihood of qualifying for a new credit card.\n\nYou may also have to meet minimum income requirements, depending on the card.\n\nHow to transfer a credit card balance\n\nThe first step in transferring a credit card balance is to apply for your new card, either online through the financial institution\u2019s website or in person at a branch. During the application process, the new credit card provider will typically ask you to check a box or fill out the information to set up a balance transfer from another card. This includes the card number, issuer name and amount you want to transfer. Once your credit card application is approved, the transfer will take place.\n\nHow long does it take to transfer a credit card balance?\n\nThe time it takes for a balance transfer depends on your financial institution. Some banks note that the transfer will take three or four days, while others say it may take up to three or four weeks.\n\nIs a balance credit card transfer a good idea?\n\nWhether or not a balance transfer credit card is a good option for you \u2014 and how much you could save \u2014 depend on many factors:\n\nYour balance.\n\nYour plans to fit repayment into your budget.\n\nPromotional interest rates and period.\n\nTransfer fees.\n\nCard annual fees.\n\nEligibility and other balance transfer terms.\n\nPros\n\nPay less interest. In many cases, a 0% interest offer on a balance transfer credit card can be a good option if you carry a balance on your current card. That interest-free period will give you a break from accumulating large amounts of interest and could save you money in the long run. Even a rate that isn\u2019t quite 0% could help you save on interest charges.\n\nReduce your debt faster. Normally, carrying a credit card balance from month to month means paying a high rate of interest, which increases your debt. With a low or 0% interest rate, all of your monthly payment will go toward reducing the principal. This can help you to pay off debt faster than you\u2019d otherwise be able to.\n\nCons\n\nPotential for a high ongoing rate. After the promotional period ends, your balance transfer credit card will revert to a regular interest rate, and any remaining balance will be subject to that rate \u2014 which may be as high as the one from your previous credit card.\n\nBalance transfer limits. If you carry a large balance on your old credit card, there\u2019s also a chance you won\u2019t be able to transfer the entire balance over to the new card due to balance transfer limits.\n\nTransfer fees. Another consideration is that balance transfer credit cards charge a transfer fee that is calculated as a percentage of the amount you transfer.\n\nAlternatives to a balance transfer credit cards\n\nIf you prefer not to get a balance transfer card, one alternative is to seek out a line of credit and use it to pay off your credit card balance.\n\nLines of credit typically charge lower interest rates than credit cards, though not as low as 0%. However, interest is charged as soon as you make a purchase (rather than after a grace period, as with credit cards) and rates are generally subject to changes based on the bank\u2019s prime lending rate.",

You can choose when to redeem cash back, in increments as little as $1; you can also set up automatic recurring redemptions of $25 or more.\n\nfeatured BMO CashBack Mastercard go to site Annual fee: $0 Earn rate: 0.5% \u2013 3% cash back 3% cash back on groceries (on the first $500 per month)\n\n1% on recurring bills\n\n0.5% on everything else Welcome offer: Earn up to 5% cash back during your first three months. go to site Card details Interest rates 21.99% on purchases, 23.99% on cash advances, 23.99% on balance transfers Income required $15,000 per year Credit score None specified\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest credit card for groceries and gas\n\nAt a glance: When it comes to can\u2019t-avoid-it expenses, gas and groceries top the list. Our pick for the best gas and grocery credit card in Canada was a draw, with each card boasting 4% cash back on both filling your tank and your fridge, as well as some pretty decent earn rates in other categories and perks. Which card you choose will really depend on where you tend to spend more, and what perks are most useful to you. This credit card offers compelling earn rates on all types of food purchases\u2014with 4% cash back on groceries and 2% on dining (including take out and food deliveries). And you will earn 4% on gas as well helping you earn at the pump while on your way to earn at the grocery store.

Shoppers who pay with this card will earn a whopping 30 PC Optimum points per $1 on grocery purchases (equivalent to 3.0%) at any Loblaw banner store and at PC Travel; 45 points per $1 at Shoppers Drug Mart; and 10 points per $1 everywhere else. Gas purchases at Esso and Mobil earn at least 30 points per litre, making this an all-around valuable card for everyday living expenses. PC Optimum points are easily redeemed at the checkout counter starting at 10,000 points (which is equal to $10) and can be used on any products in participating stores.\n\nPC World Elite Mastercard go to site Annual fee: $0 Rewards: 10 \u2013 45 Points per dollar 45 PC Optimum points per $1 at Shoppers Drug Mart\n\n30 points per $1 at Loblaw banner grocery stores\n\nAt least 30 points per litre at Esso and Mobil gas stations\n\n10 points per $1 on everything else go to site Card details Interest rates 21.99% on purchases, 22.97% on cash advances (21.97% for residents of Quebec) Income required Personal income of $80,000 or household income of $150,000 Credit score 560 or higher Point value 10 PC points = $0.01 at Loblaws grocery network and Shoppers Drug Mart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest points cards for groceries\n\nAt a glance: For those who want to turn their grocery purchases into world travel, the American Express Cobalt is here to help. There are a few standout elements of this card, starting with the unique payment structure that bills the annual fee in monthly installments of $12.99. The earn rate on groceries as well as dining out and food delivery services is a very competitive 5 points per $1. Because this is a travel-based card, it should come as no surprise that there are some sweet perks geared toward frequent flyers and drivers, like emergency medical coverage and car rental theft and damage coverage. Cardholders are also eligible for a credit on amenities at participating hotels. It does bear mentioning that because this is an American Express card, it is not accepted at every store\u2014but if you\u2019re a shopper at Food Basics, Longo\u2019s, McEwan, Metro, Pusateri\u2019s, Rabba, Safeway, Sobeys or Whole Foods, you\u2019re golden. Loblaw banner stores, including No-Frills, do not accept Amex.\n\nfeatured American Express Cobalt Annual fee: $156 Rewards: 1 to 5 points per dollar 5 points per $1 on dining and groceries\n\n3 points per $1 on streaming services\n\n2 points per $1 on transit and gas\n\n1 point per $1 on all other purchases Welcome offer: Earn 1,250 points for each month you spend $750, up to a maximum of 15,000 points.

Here\u2019s how it works with the Scotiabank Gold: For every point you earn, you get $0.01 redeemable toward travel, which is easy to figure out and calculate. Just think of it like a cash-back credit card with 1% earn rate toward travel savings. While we\u2019re comparing the two, it\u2019s worth noting that the American Express Cobalt has an edge on the Scotiabank Gold American Express card since the former lets you get 15% to 75% more value out of your points through Amex\u2019s fixed points travel chart or by transferring points to hotel loyalty programs. Neither are available with the Scotiabank Gold. That said, the Scotiabank Gold American Express is still a great card. Plus, the Scotiabank Gold American Express has some great perks that the Cobalt doesn\u2019t, like no foreign transaction fees and additional points on entertainment and streaming services.\n\nfeatured Scotiabank Gold American Express go to site Annual fee: $120 Rewards: 1 \u2013 6 Points per dollar 6 points per $1 at Sobeys-affiliated stores\n\n5 points per $1 on dining, entertainment and groceries\n\n3 points per $1 on gas, transit and streaming\n\n1 point per $1 on everything else\n\nPay no FX fees on foreign purchases Welcome offer: Earn up to $780 in value in the first 12 months, including up to 40,000 bonus Scene+ points.

To answer this question, start by taking stock of your spending habits. How frequently you use your credit card for grocery purchases, where you choose to shop, and what secondary purchase categories you spend the most money on will determine the best card for you. For example, if you don\u2019t use credit for groceries very often, you may be better off with a no-fee credit card\u2014otherwise, any rewards you receive may be offset by the annual fee. On the other hand, if you shop frequently at a particular banner or grocery store, you\u2019ll want the card that offers the most cash back or points at your chosen retailer. If you spend as much on groceries as you do on gas, look for a card that offers high earn rates on both spending categories. Should you buy groceries with a credit card? Using your credit card for grocery purchases can help offset the rising costs of groceries in Canada. Since groceries are a necessary expense, it may be helpful to earn a return\u2014in the form of cash back or points\u2014by paying with credit. This can help reduce the overall cost of groceries, especially if you are strategic about where and how you shop. As with other credit card purchases, however, make sure you have the money needed to pay off your credit card balance at the end of the month. Carrying a balance on your card may cost you more in interest than the rewards are worth. What grocery stores accept American Express in Canada? The major grocery stores that accept American Express and let you earn bonus points for grocery purchases include: 88 Supermarket, Bownesian Grocer, Farm Boy, Federated Co-op, Longo\u2019s, Metro, Safeway, Sobeys, Rabba, Pusateri\u2019s Fine Foods, Whole Foods and Instacart. The American Express Cobalt and Scotiabank Gold American Express* offer the most bonus points for grocery purchases on our list, but they aren\u2019t as widely accepted as some other cards. For example, they aren\u2019t accepted at No Frills and Costco. Do credit card companies consider Walmart a grocery store? Walmart may be synonymous with groceries for you, but not all credit cards recognize Walmart as a \u201cgrocery store.\u201d While American Express and Visa are accepted at Walmart, neither credit card company categorizes Walmart on their merchant code system as a grocery store. For instance, while the TD CashBack Visa Infinite earns 3% cash back on groceries, it earns just the base 1% cash back rate at Walmart. If you frequent the Walmart Supercentre, know that Mastercard does, however, recognize several Walmart Supercentre locations for grocery purchases\u2014but not all. You will have to check with Mastercard to find out if the Walmart Supercentre near you qualifies. The best credit cards to use for groceries at Walmart Supercentres include the BMO CashBack Mastercard and Tangerine Money-Back Card. If you prefer to \u201cadd to cart\u201d at Walmart.ca for grocery pickup and grocery delivery, the Walmart World Mastercard is a good card to look at. It earns you 3% on online purchases from Walmart (and 1.25% when shopping in store and 1% at all other grocery stores). Do credit card companies reward grocery purchases at Costco? Costco exclusively accepts Mastercard credit cards (sorry Visa users.) Costco isn\u2019t recognized as a \u201cgrocery store\u201d in credit card reward programs, either, but you can still earn rewards\u2014it just won\u2019t be as many rewards as you might get elsewhere for groceries. For example, the BMO CashBack Mastercard earns 3% on groceries, but at Costco you earn the card\u2019s base earn rate of 0.5% on your purchases. That\u2019s why we categorized the MBNA Rewards World Elite Mastercard as the best credit card for use at Costco, since it earns double the points\u2014regardless of the purchase category. Other great cards to use at Costco include the BMO CashBack World Elite Mastercard and the Rogers World Elite Mastercard. What credit cards are accepted at No Frills? While it used to be that No Frills only accepted Mastercard, like Costco, the grocery chain now accepts both Visa and Mastercard. As a grocery store under the Loblaw corporate banner, however, No Frills does not accept American Express.\n\nMore of Canada\u2019s best credit cards:",

It\u2019s often said that those closest to the problem have a better understanding of the solution, they just need support to bring that vision to life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe YIC programme, part of the broader Young Africa Innovates initiative, targets youth aged 18 to 35, with a special focus on including 70% female entrepreneurs, people with disabilities, and those from marginalized communities.\n\nThe approach is designed to nurture and scale viable business ideas through rigorous selection, mentoring, and financial support phases, aiming to transform local economies by integrating innovative solutions into everyday challenges.\n\nJoshua Yeboah shared his vision for the future, and the invention aimed at assisting local community farmers.\n\n\u201cMy aim is to build an electric transport system that is both environmentally friendly and affordable to help farmers in rural communities transport their goods to markets and towns.\n\n\u201cI want to produce these tricycles to help farmers in rural areas cart their produce to the markets. This will solve the problem of struggling to find a means of transportation while their harvests go rotten on the farms,\u201d he shared.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.",

            "content": "about In Tech In Tech is our regular feature highlighting what people are talking about in the world of technology \u2014 everything from crypto and NFTs to smart cities and cybersecurity.\n\nAs 2025 arrives, technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, reshaping industries, enhancing daily life and addressing global challenges. At CES, one of the tech world\u2019s most influential trade shows, offers a hint into these developments and helping us understand where technology is headed. Here\u2019s a look at the key trends expected to define the year ahead.\n\n01\n\nAI: Yes, it's still everywhere\n\nAI is no longer a shiny buzzword; it\u2019s a baseline. The conversation continues to shift away from asking what AI can do into asking how it\u2019s solving industry-specific challenges.\n\nFor instance, in health care, AI has transitioned from vague promises to tangible outcomes. Expect to see solutions like precision diagnostics, AI-enabled prosthetics, and wearables that go beyond tracking your steps \u2014 these devices will analyze your health data in real-time to predict issues before they escalate. It\u2019s not just AI \u2014 it\u2019s useful AI.\n\nThe CES Innovation Awards reflect this evolution, with nearly 50% of winners tied to AI applications that aim to improve medical outcomes, reduce energy consumption, create safer online experiences. AI isn\u2019t news anymore\u2014how companies leverage it is.\n\n02\n\nExtended reality and spatial computing: It's not just for gamers\n\nExtended reality used to mean virtual reality headsets gathering dust in the living room or augmented reality gimmicks that felt like just another tech demo. But XR has potential for far more practical applications \u2014 particularly in business and education.\n\nExpect to see new developments in spatial computing, a concept popularized by Apple\u2019s Vision Pro but rapidly expanding beyond that. Whether it\u2019s collaborative design spaces for engineers, virtual training simulations for medical professionals, or AR and AI to enhance storytelling, XR is building on its foundation in the entertainment niche, but progressing into the workforce.\n\nThis year\u2019s CES also features sessions on the future of XR tech, with experts diving into how mixed reality can reshape industries. In other words, this isn\u2019t just about strapping on a headset \u2014 it\u2019s about merging physical and virtual worlds in ways that matter.\n\n03\n\nSustainability tech: Because it's about us\n\nWhile tech\u2019s environmental footprint can often be swept under the rug, CES 2025 puts it front and center. From renewable energy innovations to tech designed for circular economies, this year\u2019s focus on sustainability isn\u2019t just for show.\n\nNotably, the Innovation Awards now feature a category specifically for sustainability and energy solutions. This shift acknowledges that solving environmental challenges isn\u2019t optional anymore \u2014 it\u2019s imperative. Expect to see new battery technologies that extend the life of electric vehicles, smart grids that optimize power consumption, and materials that reduce waste in production.\n\nThe big takeaway? Companies aren\u2019t just showcasing eco-friendly products; they\u2019re redefining how their operations, supply chains and innovations can align with sustainability goals.\n\n04\n\nVehicle technology: Beyond electric and autonomous\n\nThe automotive sector is evolving with a focus on in-vehicle experiences. Advancements include in-car payments, next-generation entertainment systems, seamless connectivity transforming cars into mobile offices, and sophisticated safety features surpassing traditional collision warnings. Companies like John Deere are introducing autonomous agricultural vehicles, highlighting the expansion of mobility technology beyond passenger cars.\n\n05\n\nRobotics: Efficiency meets real-world impact\n\nRobotics is advancing with practical applications in mind. Collaborative robots (\u201ccobots\u201d) are enhancing productivity in manufacturing and health care, while drones are being deployed for critical tasks such as emergency response. NVIDIA's development of Jetson Thor computers aims to power humanoid robots, indicating significant strides in robotics technology.\n\n06\n\nSpace technology: Bridging orbit and Earth\n\nSpace tech innovations are finding practical applications on Earth. Developments such as satellite-powered connectivity and materials engineered for extreme conditions are influencing industries ranging from telecommunications to manufacturing, demonstrating the tangible benefits of space exploration technologies.\n\nA look ahead\n\nThe technological landscape of 2025 is one of integration and impact. Innovations are becoming more interconnected, addressing pressing challenges while creating new opportunities. The year ahead promises to redefine how technology shapes our world, from the practical applications of AI and XR to sustainability and space exploration.",

Overall retail sales saw a 3.8% increase compared to 2023, with the last five days of the holiday season accounting for 10% of all holiday spending.\n\n\u2022 A balanced basket: Consumer demand for experiences like dining out strengthened in the holiday season, with Restaurant spending growth up 6.3% compared to last year. Additionally, this season saw an increase in spending growth on goods compared to last year, with Apparel (3.6%), Jewelry (4.0%), and Electronics (3.7%) as notable sectors for gift-giving.\n\n\u2022 Clicking all the way: Consumers increasingly preferred digital-first shopping this year, with e-commerce, curbside pick-up, and delivery being top-of-mind for the festive season. Online retail sales grew 6.7% year-over-year, whereas in-store sales increased 2.9%. Notably, the Apparel sector showed a strong lead in e-commerce sales, with 6.7% growth for online purchases compared to last year.\n\n\u2022 Digital-savvy shopping cities: While many Americans shop online for the holidays, there are some cities in particular that have embraced e-commerce. Cities like Tampa (10.6%) and Phoenix (10.0%) lead with double digital growth followed by Minneapolis (8.9%), Dallas (8.4%), Charlotte (7.9%), Orlando (7.8%), and Houston (7.6%) coming in well above the national total for e-commerce sales compared to 2023.",

            "content": "Key takeaways The Instacart Mastercard\u00ae* is a solid cash back card for frequent Instacart shoppers.\n\nThis card earns 5 percent cash back on all purchases through Instacart, 2 percent back in various other categories and includes a welcome offer with a total value of $199.\n\nAlthough the card charges no annual fee, some value is lost through other fees you may be required to pay by shopping with Instacart.\n\nAs our economy continues to fight inflation, saving money and finding deals is more important than ever. Earning cash back on purchases like groceries, dining, fuel and travel can help ease the burden of higher prices. The Instacart Mastercard\u00ae aims to provide consumers with a way to do just that.\n\nThis card offers a high rate of cash back on Instacart purchases, but is it worth a spot in your wallet? We\u2019ll examine some key features and benefits of the card to help you decide if it deserves a spot in your wallet.\n\nWhen is the Instacart Mastercard worth it?\n\nHere are some reasons you might consider using this card.\n\nYou frequently shop with Instacart\n\nThe main reason you should consider an Instacart Mastercard is to earn extra cash back for shopping with Instacart.\n\nAt 5 percent back, the Instacart Mastercard offers unusually high rewards for online purchases \u2014 either through Instacart.com or through the Instacart app. Although Instacart is known primarily as a grocery delivery service, you can also make purchases from a variety of other stores \u2014 including partnered electronics, sporting goods, pharmacy and warehouse club retailers. The full list of Instacart retailers available in your area can be found here . However, the rewards don\u2019t stop there.\n\nNew cardmembers (once approved) also automatically receive $50 in Instacart credit, and the credit will be added to your instacart.com account. It\u2019s important to note that new cardmember bonus offers from Instacart are valid only once per account. If your account has already received a bonus like Instacart credit or a free Instacart + membership, you can still get the credit card but won\u2019t be eligible for another bonus.\n\nUnfortunately, other cash back cards offer more enticing welcome bonuses of $200, $300 or more, but the fact that this is a no-annual-fee card and you don\u2019t have to spend anything to earn the Instacart credit still makes it a decent deal.\n\nYou want a co-branded card that earns solid rewards and benefits elsewhere\n\nMost co-branded credit cards offer little more than the chance to earn increased rewards through purchases with a specific brand. With the Instacart Mastercard, you have the opportunity to earn some pretty solid rewards in other spending categories, as well.\n\nIn addition to earning 5 percent cash back on purchases through Instacart, this card earns 2 percent back on gas station spending, restaurants and select streaming services. You\u2019ll also earn 5 percent back on purchases made when using your card in the Chase Travel portal . All purchases made outside of these bonus categories still earn 1 percent back.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get travel insurance and purchase protection benefits with your Instacart Mastercard, including travel accident insurance and emergency assistance services, baggage delay insurance, purchase protection, lost luggage reimbursement, roadside assistance and extended warranty protection. The card also comes with no foreign transaction fees, so you can use it while traveling abroad.\n\nIt is unusual to find a co-branded credit card offering these types of bonus rewards and benefits \u2014 particularly one that comes without an annual fee and isn\u2019t specifically geared toward the travel industry.\n\nYou want flexible options for redeeming your cash back\n\nAnother advantage of the Instacart Mastercard is the flexible nature of its rewards. Your redemption options include:\n\nGift cards\n\nTravel through the Chase Travel portal\n\nA direct deposit or statement credit\n\nA credit for all or part of your Instacart orders\n\nThere is no minimum rewards balance required for direct deposits, statement credits or Instacart orders.\n\nYou want to enjoy Mastercard World Elite benefits\n\nThe Instacart Mastercard comes with World Elite Mastercard benefits , such as:\n\nZero liability protection (for fraudulent transactions)\n\n24/7 concierge services\n\nFree ShopRunner membership\n\nMastercard ID theft protection\n\nDiscounts with brands like Lyft, McAfee and Peacock\n\nAccess to air, car, hotel and vacation packages, along with the Mastercard luxury hotel and resorts portfolio\n\nAccess to in-person and digital experiences in culture, dining, sports and entertainment in destinations around the world\n\nAccess to Mastercard Golf\u00ae, which provides exclusive PGA Tour\u00ae experiences and golf benefits through their Golf Concierge Service\n\nWhen is the Instacart Mastercard not worth it?\n\nDespite these perks, there are some reasons the Instacart Mastercard may not be worth it for you.\n\nYou are not a frequent Instacart shopper\n\nThe main reason to consider an Instacart Mastercard is to earn bonus rewards for shopping with Instacart.\n\nEven though the Instacart Mastercard comes without an annual fee, it may not make sense to use this co-branded card if you don\u2019t frequently shop there. Outside of purchases through Instacart, the card offers a solid 2 percent cash back on gas stations, restaurants and select streaming services. However, you may be able to maximize your cash back with other cards offering the same (or better) rewards in these categories or with cards that provide bonus rewards in categories not offered by the Instacart Mastercard.\n\nYou are fee-averse\n\nAlthough the Instacart Mastercard carries no annual fee or foreign transaction fees , there are other fees you should know about. During the first year you have the card, your Instacart+ membership waives the delivery fee (on orders over $35) and offers a discounted service fee on all orders through Instacart. However, there are other fees you may still have to pay while shopping with Instacart, including:\n\nAlcohol service fee\n\nBottle deposit and bag fees\n\nHeavy items fee\n\nLong-distance service fee\n\nPickup fee (from certain retailers)\n\nPriority fee\n\nTaxes and other fees\n\nYou may also notice that the price of some items can be higher than what you\u2019d see if you were physically shopping in a store. Tipping your shopper, although not required, may also add to the cost of your purchases.\n\nShould you get the Instacart Mastercard?\n\nLike most cards, analyzing whether this card is worth it comes down to how you will use it and your personal goals for saving time and money. Here\u2019s a spending example that breaks down how the rewards stack up against credit cards with similar rewards in common spending categories:\n\nWells Fargo Autograph\u2120 Card : 3X points on restaurant, travel, gas station, transit, popular streaming service and phone plan purchases; 1X points on other purchases\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card : 3X points on dining (including eligible delivery services), select streaming services and online grocery purchases (excluding Walmart, Target and wholesale clubs); 5X points on travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards and Lyft Rides (Lyft offer through March 31, 2025); 2X points on other travel; 1X points on all other purchases\n\nBlue Cash Everyday\u00ae Card from American Express : 3 percent cash back at U.S. supermarkets, U.S. gas stations and U.S. online retail purchases on up to $6,000 per calendar year in purchases in each category (then 1 percent); 1 percent back on other purchases\n\nSpending category Annual spending Instacart Mastercard Rewards Wells Fargo Autograph Rewards Chase Sapphire Preferred Rewards Amex Blue Cash Everyday Rewards Online Grocery/supermarket spending $6,000* $300 $60 $180 $180 Dining $4,800 $96 $144 $144 $48 Gas $3,600 $72 $108 $36 $108 Travel/travel portal spending $1,000 $50 $30 $50 $10 Streaming services $1,200 $24 $36 $36 $12 Online shopping/delivery $2,400 $120 $24 $24 $72 Cellphone bill $2,400 $24 $72 $24 $24 All other spending $6,000 $60 $60 $60 $60 Welcome bonus $50 ($50 Instacart credit earned automatically) $200 (20,000 bonus points earned after spending $1,000 in the first 3 months) $600 (60,000 bonus points earned after spending $4,000 in the first 3 months) $250 ($250 statement credit after spending $2,000 in the first 6 months) Annual fee/additional fees $0 $0 -$95 $0 First-year rewards value $796 $734 $1,059 $764 Ongoing rewards value $746 $534 $459 $514 * Assumes a 1.9 percent charge on $6,000 of online grocery orders from Instacart\n\nAlthough this is a simplified example, you can see the difference in the value you\u2019ll get from the Instacart Mastercard versus other cards on Instacart shopping. Though when you add in the 1.9 percent service fee on your Instacart orders, it cuts into some of the rewards you\u2019re earning with your Instacart card.\n\nYou might be an Instacart fan for the time savings alone, despite the extra fees. If this is the case, then getting the Instacart Mastercard would offer a slight discount and cash back on a service you\u2019d indulge in regardless \u2014 even without rewards.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAlthough a few of the Instacart Mastercard benefits truly excite us, the value of this card can get eaten away by the potential fees you could pay for using the service regularly. Those who will benefit the most from this card are people with excellent or good credit scores who are already using Instacart \u2014 and who wouldn\u2019t mind a few more incentives for doing so.\n\nIf you\u2019re strapped for time more than you\u2019re strapped for money and would use Instacart anyway, we think this card is more like \u201cicing on the cake.\u201d The Instacart Mastercard simply gives you the chance to earn rewards on a service that is valuable to you anyway.",

Thankfully, there are plenty of American Airlines credit cards to choose from, so there\u2019s something for everyone.\n\nThe AAdvantage Executive World Elite card comes with an annual $120 car rental credit. Image Credit: Katie Seemann\n\nHow To Use the Avis/Budget Car Rental Credit\n\nThe Avis/Budget car rental credit on the AAdvantage Executive World Elite card is straightforward and easy to use.\n\nTo qualify for the credit, you must make 1 or more purchases directly with a participating Avis and/or Budget location using your AAdvantage Executive World Elite card. A credit for the amount charged, up to $120 per calendar year, will appear on your statement within 8 to 10 weeks.\n\nThe $120 credit appeared on my statement about 3 weeks after this Avis car rental charge. Image Credit: Citi\n\nThe credit applies to the rental cost, including time and mileage charges, taxes, and other fees.\n\nPurchases made through third parties or as part of a package don\u2019t qualify for this credit. This can include any of the following:\n\nDiscount travel sites\n\nTour operators\n\nTravel agencies Vacation clubs\n\nVacation packages\n\nThis credit also doesn\u2019t work when renting cars through aa.com/cars; therefore, these purchases only earn 1 mile per dollar spent instead of 10 miles per dollar spent.\n\nBottom Line: The AAdvantage Executive World Elite card has an annual $120 credit for Avis or Budget car rentals booked directly with car rental agencies. This credit can be applied to taxes, other fees, and the rental cost. It will be posted automatically to your credit card statement within 8 to 10 weeks after a qualifying purchase.\n\nRental Car Insurance\n\nRemember that the AAdvantage Executive World Elite card comes with car rental insurance. When you pay for your rental with your card and decline the rental car company\u2019s collision/damage insurance, you\u2019ll be covered for up to $75,000 if the car is damaged or stolen. This coverage is secondary in the U.S. but primary outside the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe $120 Avis/Budget car rental credit on the AAdvantage Executive World Elite card is an easy-to-use perk that helps take the sting out of the card\u2019s annual fee. Even travelers who only rent a car once or twice a year can use this credit easily. All you need to do is book a car rental directly through Avis or Budget and pay with your card. A credit for the purchase amount of up to $120 per calendar year will appear on your statement within 8 to 10 weeks.",

Owning Discover's payment network once the deal is closed early this year, it no longer needs to rely on them.\n\nBut once its cards shift to Discover\u2019s network - less common outside the US - travelers could face limited payment options, experts warn.\n\n'In most cases in the US, Discover is more or less accepted everywhere that Visa, MasterCard, and American Express are,' Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, told Fortune.\n\n'Where you may run into more issues is with international travel because Discover may not be as widely accepted.'\n\nBy acquiring Discover, Capital One will then own one of the largest payment-processing networks in the country, alongside the Visa, MasterCard and American Express\n\nTravelers are advised to stay alert to these potential changes and consider backup options for international spending.\n\nCapital One said it plans to move all of its debit cards and some of its credit cards onto Discover's network starting in the second quarter of this year.\n\n'Over time, we will move a growing portion of the credit card business to the Discover network,' said Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank during an investor presentation in February last year.\n\n'In total, across debit and credit, we expect to add over 25 million Capital One cardholders and over $175 billion in Capital One purchase volume by 2027.\n\n'This injection and volume in the network will help Discover be competitive with the leading network.'\n\nCapital One is the nation's ninth-largest bank by total assets, with 259 physical branch locations, 55 'Capital One Cafes' across the country and a major online banking operation.\n\nDiscover Financial, meanwhile, is a mostly online bank with a single physical branch in Delaware.\n\nCapital One's takeover of credit card issuer Discover could cause problems for Americans using cards abroad, experts have warned\n\nIf the merger goes through, Capital One would be the largest card issuer in the country based on outstanding credit card loans, becoming even larger than JPMorgan Chase\n\nAnother key element of the merger is how it could affect competition within the payments network space.\n\nThere is a possibility the merger reduces competition among issuers, and progressive Democratic lawmakers have long fought against bank consolidation, arguing it increases systemic risk and hurts consumers by reducing lending.\n\nNew research from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that larger credit card issuers charged higher interest rates and annual fees than smaller banks, due to a lack of competition.\n\nIf the merger goes through, Capital One would be the largest card issuer in the country based on outstanding credit card loans, becoming even larger than JPMorgan Chase.\n\n'Anytime there's more consolidation and less competition, there's always the possibility for rates and fees to increase, but I don't see it being a huge issue,' Schulz said.\n\nHe argues, however, that the deal could in fact make the payment processing space more competitive, challenging the dominance of MasterCard and Visa.\n\nThis could lead to better rewards on credit cards for consumers as issuers compete for customers.\n\n'One thing that will be interesting to watch is how the credit card rewards programs are blended together,' Schulz added.\n\n'Capital One will have to decide how they handle Discover miles and if they keep those two rewards programs separate or if they bring them together, and that decision will impact consumers.'\n\nInflation starts to bite into the value of points if users redeem them directly through a bank's portal or online app\n\nMeanwhile, a recent report showed how the value of credit card reward points has been gradually falling - as inflation has taken hold.\n\nA reward point has long been worth around one cent when used to cover other purchases.\n\nBut one cent has lost around 20 percent of its purchasing power since 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis means a point has also fallen in value by about the same amount. If you built up 50,000 points with a major credit card issuer in 2020 and still have not spent them, they are now worth about 41,300.",

            "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? MasterCard (MA), which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nThis processor of debit and credit card payments has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3.28%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, MasterCard came out with earnings of $3.89 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.73 per share, representing a surprise of 4.29%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $3.51 per share and it actually produced earnings of $3.59 per share, delivering a surprise of 2.28%.\n\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for MasterCard. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nMasterCard currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.20%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.",

The companies had charged cardholders an extra fee, which led to the lawsuit.\n\nVisa and Mastercard ATM Fee Refund Lawsuit: As the largest payment processing networks globally, Visa and Mastercard recently faced a significant legal defeat. A U.S. court has ruled that they must refund a total of $197 million to their cardholders.\n\nEarlier this year, a U.S. court instructed Visa and Mastercard to refund money they had taken from their users\u2019 accounts as extra fees. The court ruled that these additional charges were illegal.\n\nReports indicate that Visa will return $104.6 million to its customers, while Mastercard will refund $92.8 million as part of the settlement.\n\nIn the U.S., Visa and Mastercard ATM users are charged extra fees when withdrawing money from ATMs. The court ruled these fees were illegal and ordered both companies to refund the amount.\n\nAre you eligible to file a claim?\n\nThe $197 million settlement applies to consumers who made cash withdrawals from bank-operated ATMs starting in 2007.\n\nNot all Visa and Mastercard users will qualify for a refund. The two main conditions for eligibility are:\n\nThe user must have paid a non-refundable surcharge while using a Visa or Mastercard debit card at an ATM in the U.S. between October 1, 2007, and July 26, 2024.\n\nThe fee must have been charged by a bank within the Visa or Mastercard ATM network, such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, or Bank of America.\n\nAccording to available details, Visa charges card issuers on a per-transaction basis or based on transaction volume. In contrast, Mastercard applies fees to issuing institutions as a percentage of the total global dollar volume of all transactions made with their cards during a specific timeframe.\n\nHow to Submit a Claim\n\nFiling for a refund is simple and doesn\u2019t require supporting documents upfront. Just follow these steps:\n\nVisit the official class action website. Complete the online claim form, or download it, fill it out, and send it by mail to:\n\nATM Surcharge Settlement\n\nP.O. Box 170500\n\nMilwaukee, WI 53217 Include your contact information and sign a sworn statement confirming that you were charged excessive surcharges. This statement is legally binding, so be truthful.\n\nAlthough documentation isn\u2019t needed initially, the claims administrator may ask for additional proof later in the process.\n\nWho Can Get a Refund from Visa and Mastercard?\n\nNot everyone who paid ATM fees will qualify for a refund. If you think you might be eligible, it\u2019s important to check the settlement\u2019s requirements.\n\nYou may be eligible if:\n\nYou were charged an unreimbursed fee for using a Visa or Mastercard debit card at a U.S. ATM between October 1, 2007, and July 26, 2024.\n\nThe fee was charged by a bank that\u2019s part of the Visa or Mastercard ATM network, such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, or Bank of America.\n\nYou are not eligible if:\n\nYou\u2019ve already been reimbursed for your ATM fees.\n\nYour debit card was issued in a country outside the United States.\n\nKeep in mind, if you took part in a previous ATM fee settlement and got a refund, you\u2019ll need to file a new claim to qualify for any additional refunds for surcharges collected afterward.\n\nMark Your Calendar!\n\nThis settlement comes after the U.S. Supreme Court decided in April to deny an appeal from Visa and Mastercard. The companies had contested a lower court\u2019s ruling that allowed multiple plaintiffs to merge their lawsuits into a class action.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been impacted by Visa and Mastercard ATM fees in recent years, there are two key dates to remember. First, you must submit your claim by January 22, 2025. To be included in the settlement, ensure all forms are completed accurately and sent in before this deadline.\n\nThe final approval hearing is scheduled for January 24, 2025, two days after the claim submission deadline. During this hearing, the court will examine the settlement to ensure it meets legal requirements and is fair, reasonable, and sufficient for everyone affected. Be sure to submit your claim on time to secure your eligibility for a refund.",

There have also been changes to the fees charged by the two remaining processors.\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about paying taxes with credit cards\u2026\n\nImportant due dates\n\n(all online payment dates from Pay1040.com)\n\n2024 Tax Year Due Dates\n\nApril 15th, 2025: 2024 annual tax filing due\n\n2025 Tax Year Due Dates\n\nApril 15th, 2025: 1st Quarter 2025 estimated taxes due.\n\n(Payable online from 3/1/2025 \u2013 5/15/2025)\n\n(Payable online from 3/1/2025 \u2013 5/15/2025) June 16th, 2025: 2nd Quarter 2025 estimated taxes due.\n\n(Payable online from 5/15/2025 \u2013 7/15/2025)\n\n(Payable online from 5/15/2025 \u2013 7/15/2025) September 15th, 2025: 3rd Quarter 2025 estimated taxes due.\n\n(Payable online from 7/15/2025 \u2013 10/15/2025)\n\n(Payable online from 7/15/2025 \u2013 10/15/2025) January 15th, 2026: 4th Quarter 2025 estimated taxes due.\n\n(Payable online from 10/15/25 \u2013 1/1/26)\n\n5 reasons to pay federal taxes with a credit card or gift card\n\n1. Profit w/ a Cash Back card earning up to 4%\n\nA number of credit cards earn cash rewards greater than 2%. Some even earn 3% or 4% cash back:\n\nThe new/updated PayPal Mastercard will earn 3% cash back on all PayPal purchases. Details here. This approach will work only with the services that allow payment through PayPal.\n\nThe Discover It Miles card earns 3% for the first year of card membership (you earn 1.5% and then at the end of the year all cash back earned is doubled).\n\nThe US Bank Smartly card earns up to 4% cash back depending on how much you have deposited with US Bank in an eligible account.\n\nSince you\u2019ll earn up to 4% cash back on both the base tax payment and the processing fees with the above cards, your profit could be slightly more than 2% of your tax payment.\n\nExample:\n\n$10,000 tax payment + 1.75% fee = $10,175\n\nCash back earned at 4% = $407.00\n\nProfit = $407 \u2013 $175 = $232 (2.32% of $10K)\n\nFor more examples of cards that earn better than 2% rewards, see: Best Rewards for Everyday Spend.\n\n2. Meet minimum spend requirements\n\nIf you recently signed up for new credit cards, chances are good that you have to spend thousands of dollars in order to earn the associated signup bonuses. Paying taxes is a cheap and easy way to accomplish that.\n\nBelow are some of the most valuable current welcome bonuses for consumer cards. If you\u2019re interested in business cards, please click here to see the best business card offers.\n\nClick on a card for details; Press \u201cNext\u201d to see more offers:\n\n3. Buy points cheaply\n\nSeveral credit cards offer as much as 1.5 transferable points or miles per dollar. In these cases, a 1.75% tax payment fee means that you can essentially buy miles for 1.15 cents each. Even better, some cards earn 2 transferable points per dollar for all qualifying purchases. With these 2X everywhere cards you can essentially buy points/miles for 0.86 cents each. Either way, if you plan to use your points toward high value awards, this is a cheap way to acquire those points.\n\n2X Example:\n\n$10,000 tax payment + 1.75% fee = $10,175\n\nMiles earned at 2X = 20,350\n\nCost per mile = $175 / 20,350 = 0.86 cents per mile (round up to 1 cent per mile)\n\n1.5X Example:\n\n$10,000 tax payment + 1.75% fee = $10,175\n\nMiles earned at 1.5X = 15,263\n\nCost per mile = $175 / 15,263 = 1.15 cents per mile\n\nCards that offer 2X transferable points per dollar:\n\nNote that some cards offering 2x everywhere are not included below because their points are worth much less than airline miles. An example is that most Marriott cards offer 2x everywhere rewards.\n\nCards that offer 1.5X points or airline miles per dollar:\n\n4. Earn valuable big spend bonuses: elite status, free nights, companion pass, etc.\n\nMany credit cards offer bonuses for meeting high spend thresholds. You can find a comprehensive list here: Best big spend bonuses. Here are a few examples:\n\nSouthwest Plus, Southwest Premier, or Southwest Business : With Southwest cards, when you earn 135,000 points in a calendar year (including points earned from credit card spend) you get a companion pass good for an unlimited number of flights for the rest of that year and all of the next calendar year.\n\n: With Southwest cards, when you earn 135,000 points in a calendar year (including points earned from credit card spend) you get a companion pass good for an unlimited number of flights for the rest of that year and all of the next calendar year. Barclaycard JetBlue Plus, or JetBlue Business: Spend $50,000 and get Mosaic 1 status which offers free changes and cancellations; free checked bags; expedited security; early boarding; free drinks; enhanced point earnings; and 15,000 bonus points upon qualifying.\n\n5. Liquidate Visa/MasterCard gift cards cheaply\n\nVisa and MasterCard gift cards are debit cards. As such, they qualify for low flat fees for debit tax payments: $2.10 or $2.15 (depending upon the tax processor you use). In other words, your cost to liquidate $500 gift cards will be slightly less than half a percent. That\u2019s pretty cheap.\n\nIf you use $500 Visa/MasterCard gift cards, then you can pay the following amounts:\n\nThe biggest problem with this (besides the fact that what works and what doesn\u2019t work keeps changing!) is the IRS imposed 2 payments per processor limit. This means that you can liquidate no more than 4 gift cards per type of tax payment now that PayUSATax is no longer available. In the past, Official Payments allowed more.\n\nSee also: Best options for buying Visa and MasterCard gift cards.\n\nHow to pay taxes via credit card: Key Information\n\nHere is key information you\u2019ll need to know about paying taxes with credit or debit cards:\n\nCredit card fee 1.75% to 2.95%\n\nThe IRS maintains a list of companies that accept credit and debit cards towards tax payments. You can find the current information by clicking here. Alternatively, you can pay taxes via the Plastiq Bill Pay service or Melio Bill Pay service.\n\nPay 1040 fees\n\nConsumer or Small Business Credit card: 1.75%\n\nCommercial credit or debit card: 2.89%\n\nConsumer debit card: $2.15\n\nACI Payments\n\nConsumer Credit Card: 1.85%\n\nBusiness Credit or Debit Card: 2.95%\n\nConsumer debit card: $2.10\n\nPlastiq fee\n\nCredit or debit card: 2.9% + $1.49 per payment\n\nMelio fee for paying business taxes\n\nCredit or debit card: 2.9%\n\nAdditional Info Direct from the IRS\n\nThe IRS page that lists options for paying by credit or debit card also lists the following \u201cAdditional Information\u201d:\n\nNo part of the card service fee goes to IRS.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to send in a voucher if you pay by card.\n\nCard processing fees are tax deductible for business taxes.\n\nYou must contact the card processor to cancel a card payment.\n\nIRS will refund any overpayment unless you owe a debt on your account.\n\nYour card statement will list your payment as \u201cUnited States Treasury Tax Payment\u201d and your fee as \u201cTax Payment Convenience Fee\u201d or something similar.\n\nFederal tax lien releases can take up to 30 days after we receive full payment; liens may remain for other individuals who haven\u2019t fully paid their portion.\n\nWhen you pay while filing your taxes through online software, different card fees apply.\n\nTwo payment limit per processor\n\nThe IRS maintains a table of frequency limits for paying taxes via credit or debit card (found here). In general, they say you can make up to two payments per tax period per type of tax payment. For example, you can make 2 payments every quarter to your quarterly estimated taxes, and you can make 2 payments every year to your annual taxes. Important: In my experience, these limits are enforced per payment processing company. That means that you can really make up to 4 payments per tax period per type of tax payment, (or more if you make Plastiq bill payments as well). An IRS advisor I spoke with several years ago did not think that there would be any problem with making more than 2 payments by using different processors. Since then, I have made more than 2 payments per tax period many times and never had any issues. That is, of course, just my own personal experience. I can\u2019t guarantee that your outcome would be the same.\n\nTwice as many potential payments when filing jointly\n\nIf you file jointly with a partner, you can make payments in each person\u2019s name, separately. These payments will still apply to the one overall tax return, but not always automatically. According to reader reports, in some cases the IRS matches these payments to the combined return automatically. In other cases, people have reported the need to call the IRS to ask them to combine the payments. I recommend calling shortly after filing your annual taxes to ensure that the IRS has correctly applied both sets of payments to the same return.\n\nObviously if you are filing separately, you can each make your own payments without any issues.\n\nUnlimited payments via Plastiq\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to incur higher fees, you can make an unlimited number of tax payments via the Plastiq bill pay service. Plastiq usually charges 2.9% + $1.49 to pay bills (including taxes) via credit card, but they occasionally offer lower fees via short term promotions. For details, please see: Plastiq Bill Payment Service.\n\nTo pay taxes via Plastiq, use Plastiq\u2019s tax payment screen: plastiq.com/us-taxes.\n\nUnlimited business tax payments via Melio\n\nMelio is a bill payment service like Plastiq (see above), but it only allows paying business expenses. If you\u2019re paying taxes for your business, that should be fine. Melio charges a 2.9% fee to pay by credit card.\n\nFor details, including the latest Melio welcome offer, see: Melio \u2013 Pay business bills by credit card.\n\nPay with PayPal\n\nBoth payment processors allow payments via PayPal. Sometimes cards like the Discover It, Discover It Student, and Chase Freedom Flex offer 5% rewards for PayPal purchases (up to $1500 combined spend per quarter). Tax payments during these times should count!\n\nThis might also be a good option for payments with a commercial credit or debit card as this might bypass the higher 2.89%-2.95% fee and only charge the lower 1.75%-1.85% fee.\n\nPay with Samsung Pay & Google Pay\n\nSome tax payment websites support mobile wallet payments such as Samsung Pay or Google Pay. The US Bank Altitude Reserve card earns 3X for mobile wallet payments, so it should be a great match. However, readers have reported that Samsung Pay and Google Pay are only supported through Visa Checkout and that this does not trigger the Altitude\u2019s 3X rewards.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat should I do if a processor won\u2019t let me use business card to pay personal taxes?\n\nThere are some processors that will give you an error if you try to use what it identifies as a business credit card. Fortunately, there\u2019s usually an easy workaround: add your business card to your PayPal account and use that to pay.\n\nWill I be charged a cash advance fee when paying taxes with a credit card?\n\nI\u2019m often asked whether credit card companies charge cash advance fees when paying taxes by credit card. The answer is no. Both official IRS payment processors agree (via their FAQ pages) that the payment is treated as a purchase not a cash advance. You can find FAQ info here and here.\n\nAre tax payment fees deductible?\n\nFees are no longer deductible for personal taxes: Tax preparation fees used to be deductible when itemizing deductions for personal tax returns, but that is no longer the case.\n\nCard processing fees are tax deductible for business taxes: This can substantially reduce your net cost of using payment services.\n\nHow can I see my tax payment history online?\n\nOnce you\u2019ve made payments through online processors, Plastiq, or other means, you may want to see proof that the IRS received the amount you sent. You can view past payments by signing up here: irs.gov/payments/view-your-tax-account.\n\nWhen should I report estimated tax payments?\n\nEstimated payments should be reported when filing your annual taxes. In my experience, if you make a mistake and forget to report some of these payments, the IRS will eventually catch the error and refund the difference.\n\nHow should I pay end of year taxes?\n\nTell your tax preparer or tax software that you\u2019ll pay via check. Then, browse to the appropriate tax payment site (e.g. Pay1040.com, OfficialPayments.com, or Plastiq.com/us-taxes) to pay your taxes. There is no need to mail in the 1040V payment voucher.\n\nWhat happens if I over-pay my taxes?\n\nOverpayments will be refunded: The IRS will refund any overpayment unless you owe a debt on your account.\n\nHow do I request a refund if it doesn\u2019t come automatically?\n\nSchedule an appointment with the Taxpayer Assistance Center by calling 844-545-5640. When you finally speak to an agent, explain that you overpaid and would like a refund rather than applying the extra to next year\u2019s taxes. Hat Tip: Rapid Travel Chai via personal communication.\n\nDo I need to mail in payment vouchers?\n\nNo. No payment voucher is required. You don\u2019t need to send in a voucher if you pay by card.",

Therefore, your experience very much depends on how willing the hotel is to follow the rulebook, and YMMV.\n\nThere is one guaranteed benefit, however- breakfast for Titaniums. This was introduced in 2024, and is now available at the following brands:\n\nAndronis\n\nAraiya Hotels & Resorts\n\nCapella Hotels & Resorts\n\nDivani Collection\n\nLore Group\n\nLungarno Collection\n\nMarco Polo Hotels\n\nMaqo Hotels\n\nMysk Hotels\n\nNiccolo Hotels\n\nNikki Beach Hotels & Resorts\n\nPan Pacific Hotels & Resorts\n\nParamount Hotels\n\nPARKROYAL Hotels & Resorts\n\nPARKROYAL COLLECTION Hotels & Resorts\n\nShaza Hotels\n\nThe Set Collection\n\nGrand Hotel Heiligendamm\n\nUnike Hoteller\n\nThis is offered daily for up to two adults per room, and the savings can really add up over longer stays.\n\nWhat other hotel status do Mastercard customers enjoy?\n\nMastercard has been busy striking deals with smaller hotel loyalty programmes, and cardholders can enjoy fast-tracks to elite status with eight programmes in total.\n\nLike I said, these aren\u2019t necessarily the largest loyalty chains out there- I know I\u2019d rather have Hilton Gold status than Swiss Belexecutive \u201cGold Influencer\u201d, whatever that is.\n\nBut still, if your travel plans bring you to one of these hotels, then I\u2019m sure you\u2019d rather have some status than none at all.\n\nConclusion\n\nMastercard has once again extended its tie-up with GHA DISCOVERY, which grants cardholders instant elite status up to Titanium.\n\nTitanium perks are great to have, with double category room upgrades and complimentary breakfast (at participating brands) particularly useful. Even Platinum gives you a shot at a room upgrade, and given how easy it is to get a World Mastercard you really shouldn\u2019t be anything less than that.\n\nI\u2019m really digging Mastercard\u2019s strategy of partnering up with numerous hotel chains for status fast tracks. Even if some of them are rather obscure, who knows? It might come in useful some point down the road.",

            "content": "What\u2019s the best credit card in Canada? With so many cards on the market, it can be difficult to pick a single Visa or Mastercard, let alone one best overall credit card. This is true for two reasons: one, because there are so many cards that it can be overwhelming and two, because (spoiler alert) there isn\u2019t one single one-size-fits-all best card for everyone.\n\nOur list gives you the cards we judge as the best credit cards for Canadians in 12 different categories. We also spend some time breaking down exactly what each kind of card does and listing some questions you should know the answers to before you start seriously looking for a new card. By the end of this article, you should have a solid idea of what kinds of cards are a good bet for you and be well on your way to picking your best credit card in Canada.\n\nTop Canadian Credit Cards: Quick Comparison\n\nBest Overall Credit Card For Canadians: Neo Financial\n\nMillion Dollar Journey\u2019s Overall Rating: 5/5\n\nOur pick for the best credit card in Canada is the Neo Financial Mastercard (Neo CardTM). This no-fee cashback card from Neo, a digital finance company, offers unparalleled flexibility, earn rates, and ease of use.\n\nUntil recently, the Neo Financial Mastercard came in 3 tiers from the no-fee Neo Essential Credit Card to the Neo Ultra Credit Card, which was billed monthly at $8.99.\n\nHowever, as of July 2022, the Neo Plus and Ultra plans are on temporary hold. You can still apply for the Essential card which is 100% free, then upgrade your plan later on when Neo relaunches the premium packages.\n\nEven the standard Neo Financial Card has a great base cashback rate with massive cashback offers from a growing list of Neo partners including Amazon, Spotify, and DoorDash.\n\nA Neo cardholder can expect an average cashback rate of 5% (sometimes even higher). For a full analysis of the Neo Financial credit card, check out our Neo Financial Credit Card Review.\n\nAnnual Fee: $0\n\nIncome required: None\n\nWelcome bonus: Welcome bonuses (up to 15% cashback) on first purchases from Neo partner stores + $25 signup bonus.\n\nEarn rate:\n\nEarn an average of 5% at Neo partners\n\nAdditional perks/benefits: None\n\nWe love: The convenience and ease of use (the Neo app is fantastic), plus the massive cashback bonuses from Neo partners (a list that\u2019s growing!)\n\nRunner Up for Best Credit Card in Canada: Tangerine World Mastercard\n\nMillion Dollar Journey\u2019s Overall Rating: 4.8/5\n\nWith flexible cashback earning, a generous welcome bonus, and decent perks, the Tangerine World Mastercard is our runner-up for the best credit card in Canada as well as for the best no annual fee credit card in Canada.\n\nTangerine gives you ultimate earn rate flexibility. You receive 2% cashback on 2 categories of your choice (3 if you open a bank account), plus 10% cash back on the first $1,000 spent on your card. The Tangerine World Mastercard\u2019s flexibility is only matched by the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card, which has the same earn rates but fewer perks and a lower minimum income. You can find full details at our Tangerine World Mastercard Review.\n\nAnnual Fee: $0\n\nIncome required: $60,000 personal, $100,000 household\n\nWelcome bonus: earn an extra 10% back (up to $100) when you spend up to $1,000 in everyday purchases within your first 2 months.\n\nEarn rate:\n\n2% cashback on 2 or 3 categories of your choice\n\n0.5% cashback on everything else\n\nAdditional perks/benefits:\n\n90 day purchase assurance\n\nUp to 1 year extended warranty coverage\n\nRental car insurance\n\n$1,000 mobile device insurance\n\nPromotional transfer rate\n\nMastercard Travel Pass provided by DragonPass (lounge visit fees extra)\n\nWe love: The flexible categories and the hefty welcome bonus.\n\nBest Premium Cashback Card: Scotia Momentum Visa Infinite\n\nMillion Dollar Journey\u2019s Overall Rating: 4.4/5\n\nNot many premium cashback cards give you a standard earn rate of 4% cashback on groceries and recurring payments, plus 2% cashback on gas and transit. But the Scotia Momentum Visa Infinite does, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s one of our top premium cashback credit cards.\n\nThis card more than earns its annual fee with its cashback rates, insurance package, and car rental discounts. It\u2019s a great card to have in your wallet if you spend a lot on groceries like me! You can read more in our Scotia Momentum Visa Infinite review.\n\nAnnual Fee: $120\n\nIncome required: $60,000 personal or $100,000 household\n\nWelcome bonus: Earn 10% cash back on all purchases for the first 3 months after you signup (up to $2,000 in total purchases) + no annual fee in the first year.\n\nEarn rate:\n\n4% cashback on groceries and recurring payments\n\n2% cashback on gas and daily transit\n\n1% cashback on everything else\n\nAdditional perks/benefits:\n\nDiscount on car rentals, travel insurance package,\n\nUp to $1,000 mobile device insurance\n\n90-day purchase assurance\n\nUp to 1 year extended warranty coverage\n\nWe love: The excellent earn rate on groceries and subscriptions like Netflix.\n\nBest Points Card in Canada + Best Travel Credit Card: Amex Cobalt\n\nMillion Dollar Journey\u2019s Overall Rating: 4.6/5\n\nWhile the earn rate on the Amex Cobalt is truly excellent, what makes it stellar as both a points card and a travel credit card is the ability to transfer your points to airline loyalty programs like Aeroplan at a 1:1 ratio.\n\nThis means that, instead of earning 1.5 Aeroplan points per dollar spent on grocery purchases with an Aeroplan card, you can earn 5 points per dollar spent with the Amex Cobalt and then transfer the points. The Amex Cobalt also has excellent perks and insurance coverage and a major welcome bonus, making it well worth the $12.99/month feeYou can read more about this card in our Amex Cobalt review or our breakdown of the best Canadian travel credit cards.\n\nAnnual Fee: $155.88 ($12.99/month)\n\nIncome required: None\n\nWelcome bonus: Up to 30,000 bonus points (2,500 points for each month where you spend $500 on your card in the first year)\n\nEarn rate:\n\n5 points per dollar spent on restaurants, grocery stores, and delivery/takeout\n\n3 points per dollar spent on select streaming subscriptions\n\n2 points per dollar spent on gas, travel, and transit\n\n1 point per $1 spent on everything else\n\nAdditional perks/benefits:\n\nComprehensive travel insurance package\n\nMobile device insurance\n\nThe Hotel Collection (up to $100 USD to use on hotel amenities when charged to the room, a one-category room upgrade at check-in, when available)\n\nWe love: The spectacular earn rate and the ability to transfer points to a loyalty program like Aeroplan.\n\nBest Aeroplan Card: TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite\n\nMillion Dollar Journey\u2019s Overall Rating: 4.2/5\n\nAlthough the Amex Cobalt\u2019s can rack up the Aeroplan points fast, the fact is that Amex isn\u2019t accepted everywhere. That\u2019s why the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite is a great card to have in your collection. It earns you 1.5 Aeroplan points for every dollar spent on gas, groceries, and Air Canada travel and gives you the opportunity to earn points twice at Aeroplan partner stores.\n\nWith good insurance coverage, a NEXUS fee rebate, and a free checked bag on every flight, the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite is the perfect card for someone who travels Air Canada (or other Star Alliance airlines) frequently.

This no-fee cashback card gives you 3% cashback on groceries and 1% cashback on recurring payments, all without requiring a specific minimum income. Between the earn rate and the welcome bonus, the BMO Cashback Mastercard for Students is absolutely worth a look.

If you want to rack up PC Optimum points with every purchase, this is an excellent choice.

Earn rate: 30 points per dollar spent at Loblaws grocery chains (Superstore, No Frills, Dominion, Independent, Wholesale Club) Esso, Mobil, and PC Travel\n\n45 points per dollar spent at Shoppers Drug Mart\n\n10 points per dollar spent everywhere else Additional perks/benefits: Travel emergency medical insurance\n\nRental car insurance We love: The high earn rates, , the travel insurance and the fact that this is the only no-fee World Elite Mastercard in Canada. Apply For PC Financial World Elite Mastercard\n\nBest Low Interest Credit Card: MBNA True Line Gold Mastercard\n\nMillion Dollar Journey\u2019s Overall Rating: 4/5\n\nWe never recommend carrying a balance, but if you still find you do, you may want to consider a low-interest credit card like the MBNA True Line Gold Mastercard. This card is no-frills compared to most of the cards featured on this list, but it gives you something that the others don\u2019t: a comparatively minuscule 8.99% interest rate on purchases and balance transfers.\n\nDepending on the size of the balance you\u2019re carrying, this card can save you hundreds of dollars a year, far more than the cost of the (relatively low) annual fee. If you want to learn more about this card and the other low interest cards on the market, check out our list of the Best Low Interest Credit Cards in Canada.\n\nAnnual Fee: $39\n\nIncome required: None\n\nWelcome bonus: None\n\nEarn rate: N/A\n\nAdditional perks/benefits:\n\nPurchase assurance\n\nExtended warranty benefits\n\nDiscounts on car rentals\n\nWe love: The staggeringly low interest rate\n\nBest Card for Beginners: CIBC Aeroplan Visa Card Million Dollar Journey\u2019s Overall Rating: 4/5 If you want to travel the world (or at least to New York and back) without spending all of your money on flights, the CIBC Aeroplan could be a great fit, especially if you don\u2019t meet the required minimum income level for a Visa Infinite. Many Aeroplan points cards charge an annual fee, but not this one. This $0 fee card has a great offer of 10,000 points when you make a purchase of up to $200.

It gives you cashback on your purchases and acts like a cross between a Visa card and a debit card\u2014you deposit money into your KOHO account and then spend it using your Visa card.\n\nWe appreciate the cashback rewards and the perks that the premium version of the KOHO prepaid card gives us, although the no-fee KOHO Prepaid Visa is also excellent.

In order to come up with our favourites in each category, we put the cards through a rigorous analysis. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what we look at:\n\nThe company: We consider all credit card companies to make sure that they\u2019re worthy of your trust. That doesn\u2019t mean we stick to the big banks (we love solid fintech companies like Neo and KOHO), but it does mean that we make sure every card we recommend comes from a company that\u2019s regulated and licensed, that hasn\u2019t had any major issues in the news, and that doesn\u2019t have overwhelmingly negative customer reviews.\n\nWe consider all credit card companies to make sure that they\u2019re worthy of your trust. That doesn\u2019t mean we stick to the big banks (we love solid fintech companies like Neo and KOHO), but it does mean that we make sure every card we recommend comes from a company that\u2019s regulated and licensed, that hasn\u2019t had any major issues in the news, and that doesn\u2019t have overwhelmingly negative customer reviews. Rates and requirements: Next, we read the fine print and crunch the numbers:\n\nHow much does the card cost? What kind of income or credit score limits do they place on card eligibility? What are the interest rates and minimum credit limits? How much will you be paying the credit card lender every month \u2013 and what penalties will you incur if you fail to pay them?\n\nFeatures and rewards: Even the most streamlined card has something it does well. We look at the earn rates, welcome bonuses, balance transfer rates, perks, and insurance packages to find the cards that provide the most value.\n\nEven the most streamlined card has something it does well. We look at the earn rates, welcome bonuses, balance transfer rates, perks, and insurance packages to find the cards that provide the most value. Customer experiences: We investigate the overall spread of customer reviews online. Are they mostly positive? We\u2019ll consider that a point in their favour. Are they shockingly negative? While a few negative reviews are inevitable with even the best cards, we\u2019ll make sure you know if a crowd of customers is complaining about the same thing.\n\nWhat is a Credit Card and Why Do I Need One?\n\nA credit card is a card issued by a financial institution that allows its owner to borrow money (\u201ccredit\u201d) from them in order to make payments, purchases, or even access cash. Of course, the convenience of being able to access your credit line comes at a price, which is calculated as an Annual Percentage Rate (APR), or the interest rate you will be charged.\n\nThis means that you\u2019ll need to pay back the money you borrowed, and then some. Keep in mind that with many credit cards, if you don\u2019t pay the amount you owe in full each month, interest will accrue daily. This can quickly get out of control, so bear that in mind when making purchases with a credit card.\n\nWhile we definitely recommend only spending what you can afford to pay off each month, there are some noteworthy benefits to having a credit card or two in your wallet.\n\nIt helps you build a solid credit history, which is crucial if you plan to someday apply for a home loan, car loan, or business loan.\n\nIt provides a safety net in case of an emergency, such as unexpected job loss or costly home or car repairs.\n\nIt can protect against theft, as most cards offer fraud insurance, (meaning you won\u2019t be held accountable if someone uses your card illegally).\n\nMany cards offer very attractive benefits, such as cashback, rewards, frequent flyer miles and more.\n\nTypes of Credit Cards: How to Choose the Right One for You\n\nWhen you\u2019re trying to find the best Canadian credit card for you, it helps to understand the terminology. Here are the various kinds of cards we mention in our list:\n\nRewards Credit Cards\n\nRewards credit cards give users something (generally either points or cashback) every time they use the card. There are 3 main types of rewards cards:\n\nCashback Credit Cards\n\nFor every dollar you charge to a cashback credit card, you receive a small amount of cash back (usually between 0.5 and 4 cents per dollar spent, but with welcome bonuses and special promotions, the total can be higher).\n\nCashback cards generally offer accelerated earning in certain categories (like the Scotia Momentum Visa Infinite) or at certain retailers (like the Neo Financial Credit Card), with a smaller base rate of earning for everything else. Some cashback cards allow you to cash out your rewards at any time, while others allow you to cash out monthly or annually.\n\nThese cards are usually divided into 2 categories: no-fee (free) cashback and premium cashback cards. It\u2019s important to read the fine print when you\u2019re considering which card to apply for so you know when and how you can redeem your rewards.\n\nTravel Credit Cards\n\nTravel credit cards reward cardholders with points or miles in exchange for purchases. These points/miles can then be redeemed for travel-related purchases (flights, hotel stays, vacation packages, etc.\u2014it can vary by card).\n\nMany cards offer different points systems with different redemption values, but if you do your research, they can deliver major savings on travel. Travel cards often tailor their packages with travel in mind, so expect to see travel insurance, lounge access, and free checked bags on the lists of perks, especially if it\u2019s a premium travel card.\n\nStore/ Retail Credit Cards\n\nStore credit cards earn points that can be redeemed for discounts at a specific store or collection of stores. They often complement existing loyalty programs (think Cineplex\u2019s SCENE program, Loblaws\u2019s PC Optimum program, or Canadian Tire\u2019s Triangle program, all of which have basic in-store points cards in addition to credit cards) and allow cardholders to earn points with any purchase, anywhere instead of purchases at loyalty program retailers only.\n\nLow Interest Credit Cards\n\nLow interest credit cards offer lower annual interest rates and are ideal for cardholders who carry a balance. With rates as low as 8.99% (a whopping 11% less than the average annual rate), low interest cards can save cardholders hundreds of dollars annually.\n\nThese cards tend to be no-frills cards that offer few, if any, rewards or perks. They\u2019re focused on doing one thing well\u2014and that thing is saving cardholders money on interest rates.\n\nBalance Transfer Credit Cards\n\nBalance transfer credit cards are designed to help cardholders transfer outstanding balances from high interest cards to lower interest cards.\n\nA good balance transfer card will often offer a special rate (as low as 0%) for several months to give potential cardholders some help in paying down their debt. Balance transfer cards are another no-frills category of card, but if you\u2019re carrying a balance, they can be exactly the card you need.\n\nStudent Credit Cards\n\nStudent credit cards are entry-level cards designed for students and anyone without a credit score. They have fewer requirements for eligibility than standard credit cards do, and generally don\u2019t have an annual fee.\n\nThey also tend to have lower earn rates and fewer perks than standard cards, although they do often offer both, unlike many low interest or balance transfer cards.\n\nPrepaid Cards\n\nPrepaid cards are not actually credit cards at all. Cardholders load their account with funds and then use the card to spend them. Like any bank account, the money you spend comes out of the money in your account.\n\nPrepaid credit cards do not involve the extension of credit (a loan) to cardholders, and prepaid card companies do not report to credit bureaus. This means that prepaid cards do not affect your credit score at all. These cards can still be useful, especially in cases of poor or no credit.\n\nThings to Think About When Deciding What Card You Want\n\nQuestions like \u201cWhat is the absolute best credit card in Canada?\u201d seem like they should have a straightforward answer, but the truth is they don\u2019t. While we\u2019ve picked a best overall card, the fact is that your best choice will depend on what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nThe best credit card in Canada\u2026is going to be the one that\u2019s best for you. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken the time to sift through the various categories and pick out a collection of objectively excellent cards. Now that you know the best cards on the market, you need to figure out your own priorities so you can narrow down your choices. Here are some questions to help you get clear on what you\u2019re looking for:\n\nHow much are you willing to pay annually? (there\u2019s a range of cards on the market from no-fee credit cards to $599/year)\n\nWhat\u2019s your personal/household income? (Different cards have different income requirements. $15,000, $60,000, and $80,000 are common). Neo Financial Mastercard is our top pick for a card with no income requirement but great cash back rewards. For higher income brackets, check out Scotia Momentum Visa Infinite.\n\nAre you looking for a rewards card? If so, would you prefer cashback, travel rewards, or in-store discounts? PC Financial World Elite Mastercard has one of the best earn rate for retail points, and CIBC Aeroplan Visa is great for helping you rack up those airline miles.\n\nAre you looking for a card with a welcome bonus? The card offering the most attractive bonus at the moment is the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite, which offers new cardholders up to 50,000 Aeroplan points and waives the first year\u2019s fee.\n\nHow much are you prepared to spend to earn a welcome bonus? (Make sure you read the fine print\u2014you often have to make significant purchases to earn your bonus rewards)\n\nWhat categories of purchases do you spend the most on? (Different rewards cards offer accelerated earnings on different categories). Gas prices being what they are at the moment, a card like the CIBC Aventura Visa for Business could be a good bet, especially if you drive a lot for work. You\u2019ll get 1.5 points for every dollar spent on gas and travel with this card.\n\nDo you travel a lot? Domestically or internationally? (If you often travel internationally, a card with no foreign exchange fees is a good idea)\n\nAre there any specific perks/benefits you\u2019re looking for?\n\nDo you tend to carry a balance? The MBNA True Line Gold Mastercard can be a great option with its super low 8.99% interest rate, one of the lowest rates you can find.\n\nDo you currently have a significant balance that you want to transfer? Transferring your balance can help you dig your way out of debt more quickly. The CIBC Select Visa offers 0% interest for 10 months on balance transfers, with a 1% transfer fee.\n\nYour answers to these questions will determine which of the cards we\u2019ve listed will be the best bet for you.\n\nHow to Apply For a Credit Card in Canada\n\nSo, you\u2019ve read all about the best credit cards in Canada, and now you\u2019re ready for the next step: applying.\n\nIt might be tempting to jump right in and start entering your personal details, but try not to rush it. Remember your goals (travel points, cashback, building your credit, etc), and consider the income requirements, which will affect the outcome of whether or not your application is accepted. Each time you apply, it affects your credit score, so only apply when you\u2019re certain it\u2019s the card you want.\n\nOne more thing we recommend you do before applying is to check your credit score. That way, you\u2019ll be sure you meet the requirement before you apply. The higher your credit score, the higher your spending limit will be, and you might even get a lower APR.\n\nIf you check your credit score and discover it\u2019s not high enough to get the card of your dreams, don\u2019t worry! You can get your credit back on track with the help of prepaid cards, secured cards, and the old tried and true method of paying your bills in full each month.\n\nWhat\u2019s in My Wallet: 2025 Update\n\nNow that we\u2019ve given you the rundown on the best cards in 12 categories, here\u2019s something completely different: a list of what I\u2019m carrying in my wallet right now (check out our article on Multiple Credit Card Strategies for tips on how to build a collection of credit cards and maintain a good credit score).\n\nI carry a portfolio of 3 credit cards. Each one has something different to offer, and keeping the balances low on each of them helps me keep my cards active and my credit utilization rate low.\n\n1. Scotia Momentum Visa Infinite \u2013 The Scotia Momentum Visa Infinite is a great premium card that gives me cashback on gas and groceries (I have a teenager, and my husband commutes across the city daily. Our gas and grocery bills are immense, and I appreciate the cashback option).\n\n2. BMO Air Miles World Elite Mastercard \u2013 I\u2019ve been an Air Miles collector for over 20 years, so an Air Miles card is a given for us. I like to use the BMO Air Miles World Elite Mastercard to take advantage of the accelerated earnings at Air Miles partner locations. Also, a Mastercard comes in handy for Costco runs (see above re: a teenager and my grocery bills)\n\n3. Scotia SCENE Visa \u2013 My husband and I are big movie fans, so whenever we go on a movie date, we use my Scotia SCENE Visa to collect SCENE points. I love a card that rewards us for having fun!\n\n4. 4. I recently added the Neo Financial Mastercard to my wallet to take advantage of the cashback promotions they offer on purchases from partner stores. Considering that it costs literally nothing to try it out, it was a no-brainer \u2013 and I\u2019m so glad I went for it, as the 5% cash back is simply the best offer in Canada!\n\nCanadian Credit Cards FAQ\n\nWhat is Canada\u2019s Best Credit Card in 2025? While there\u2019s no single best credit card for everyone, the Neo Financial credit card offers unparalleled ease of access and user-friendliness, plus excellent cashback rates at a huge (and growing) range of partner stores.

            "content": "Balance Transfer Promotions (and why low rates are awesome)\n\nA promotional balance transfer rate is a dramatically low interest rate that a credit card offers new cardholders who transfer a balance when they open their card. These rates generally range from 0% to 3.99%, whereas your standard credit card interest rate usually sits at around 20%.\n\nCredit card companies offer these promotional rates for a set period (6-9 months is a common length). After that, they begin charging standard interest rates on the balance.\n\nWhat this means for you, a new cardholder, is that you get a reprieve of several months where more of your money can go towards paying off, or at least paying down, your balance instead of going to interest. With promotional rates as low as 0%, a few months can make a big difference!\n\nA Warning About Balance Transfer Card Fees\n\nMost (not all, but most) credit card companies charge a fee for a balance transfer. It\u2019s calculated as a percentage of your total transferred debt. The most common balance transfer fee on this list is 1%, but it can be higher. Make sure you take this fee into consideration when you\u2019re looking at cards \u2013 it can add up, and the transfer fee actually made the difference between the winner and runner up in our first category!\n\nHow We Picked the Best Balance Transfer Cards\n\nAn important thing to remember about an introductory balance transfer rate is that promotional periods end. It\u2019s essential to take the card\u2019s everyday details into account and pick a card that will work for you outside of the balance transfer period.\n\nThat\u2019s why we took more than just the introductory offer into account when we made our list. We looked at each card\u2019s:\n\nInterest rate\n\nEarn rate (where applicable)\n\nAny available perks\n\nso we could give you a range of excellent Canadian balance transfer credit cards to consider. That way you\u2019ll know what kind of card you\u2019re signing up for and be able to pick the one that fits you best while knowing that your list of potential cards is solid.\n\nThe Best Canadian Balance Transfer Credit Cards: Some Things To Consider\n\nKeep in mind that the best card for you may not necessarily be the card with the lowest balance transfer rate. Take a minute before you start your credit card search and think about what exactly you\u2019re looking for.\n\nAre you looking for a no-frills card to help you pay off a balance, and keep your total interest rate low?\n\nAre you looking for an everyday use card with some perks (which also happens to help you pay off your balance)?\n\nDo you want to earn rewards or cash back?\n\nHow much are you transferring? Is it enough that a higher transfer fee will really cost you?\n\nThere\u2019s a card for all these situations, but they\u2019re not necessarily going to be the same card. That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t pick a single \u201cbest\u201d Canadian balance transfer card (although we do have a couple of favourites). The only \u201cbest\u201d that matters here is \u201cbest for you.\u201d You might also want to check our list of best credit cards in Canada first, and try to figure out whether a balance transfer card is actually the best match for you.\n\nBest Introductory Balance Transfer Offer/Best Low Interest Card: CIBC Select Visa\n\nThe words \u201c0% interest on balance transfers\u201d has a certain magic ring to it. The CIBC Select Visa gives new cardholders a 0% rate on balance transfers for 10 months with a 1% balance transfer fee, and is our winner for best introductory balance transfer offer.\n\nThe CIBC Select Visa was our Best Introductory Balance Transfer Card winner on our Best Low Interest Cards in Canada list, and we stand behind that award. The 1% balance transfer fee means you\u2019re only paying 1 cent on the dollar for balance transfers, and once the promotional period ends, your interest rate stays about 6% lower than the industry average.\n\nAnnual Fee: $29\n\n$29 Minimum Income: $15,000 household\n\n$15,000 household I nterest Rate: 13.99% on both purchases and cash advances.

Earn rate: n/a\n\nn/a Travel Insurance: 100,000 Common Carrier accident insurance\n\n100,000 Common Carrier accident insurance Perks: 25% off participating car rental services\n\nCIBC Select Visa is a low interest card that doesn\u2019t offer a lot of perks. It gives cardholders $100,000 in Common Carrier Accident Insurance and offers optional additional insurance for a fee.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Nothing fancy.\n\nHowever, if you want to keep things simple and focus on paying down your debt, the CIBC Select Visa is a fantastic option. With an everyday interest rate of 13.99% for both purchases and cash advances, it\u2019s a no-frills low interest card that can help you get to a zero balance faster. We appreciate a card that does a single job extremely well, and the CIBC Select Visa does that.\n\nRunner Up for Best Introductory Balance Transfer Offer/Best Low Interest Card: MBNA True Line Mastercard\n\nThe MBNA True Line Mastercard is another low interest credit card with no annual fee. It doesn\u2019t offer rewards or any perks beyond a 10% discount on Avis and Budget car rentals. But what it does offer is the longest introductory balance transfer promotional period we\u2019ve seen: 0% interest for up to 12 months.\n\nWe had this card in our number one spot for a good long while before we discovered a downside that dropped it to our runner up spot, and that\u2019s the balance transfer fee. MBNA charges 3% on introductory balance transfers \u2013 that means that if you need to move $5,000 they\u2019re going to charge you $150 to do it (which is triple what most of the other cards on the list will charge).\n\nWe do love that you can spend a full year paying down your transferred debt on this card without paying any interest at all, though. That\u2019s why it stays on our list and is still one of our favourites.\n\nAnnual Fee: $0\n\n$0 Minimum Income: None\n\nNone Interest Rate: 12.99% on purchases and balance transfers, 24.99% on cash advances.

The everyday interest rate on purchases and balance transfers is excellent and the 0% promotional balance transfer offer is great aside from the balance transfer fee.\n\nOnce your promotional period is over, you\u2019ll still only be paying 12.99% interest, which is 7% lower than average credit card rates. If you don\u2019t manage to pay off your balance over the first year (although we strongly recommend that you do), you\u2019ll still end up paying far less in interest than you would with a standard credit card. And that means you can pay the rest off faster.\n\nCanadian Cashback Card with the Best Introductory Balance Transfer Offer: BMO Cashback Mastercard\n\nThe no-fee BMO Cashback Mastercard is the first card on our list that offers rewards, plus a fully developed selection of perks. New cardholders receive a balance transfer rate of 0.99% for 9 months (plus a 2% balance transfer fee) as part of their welcome bonus package.\n\nThe BMO Cashback Mastercard also offers a welcome bonus of 5% cashback for the first three months\u2026 but be careful not to add to your existing carried balance while you\u2019re earning that cashback. Only charge purchases that you can pay off immediately (this is a good policy in general, but especially when you\u2019re carrying a balance).\n\nAfter the promotional period ends, BMO charges 19.99% interest\u2014so it\u2019s even more important to pay off your balance in those first 9 months if you possibly can.\n\nAnnual Fee: $0\n\nMinimum Income: $15,000 personal\n\nInterest Rate: 19.99% on purchases, 22.99% on cash advances (or 21.99% for Quebec residents)\n\nWelcome Bonus:\n\n0.99% introductory rate on balance transfers for 9 months with a 2% transfer fee\n\n5% cashback for the first 3 months (maximum spend of 2500 split between specific categories, e.g., 500 on groceries. Max 125 cashback)\n\nEarn rate:\n\n3% cashback on groceries\n\n1% cashback on recurring bill payments\n\n0.5% unlimited cashback on all other purchases\n\nTravel Insurance: None\n\nPerks:\n\nExtended warranty\n\nPurchase protection\n\nUp to 25% off rentals at participating National Car Rental and Alamo Rent a Car locations\n\n15% off Cirque du Soleil touring shows in Canada and 20% off resident shows in Vegas\n\nWe\u2019re big fans of the BMO Cashback Mastercard (the student version of the card is featured in our list of the Best Student Credit Cards). The rewards are good for a no-fee card, and we love the bonus earnings on groceries. If you\u2019re looking for a no-fee cashback card that also gives you a hand with a balance transfer, make sure this one\u2019s on your list!\n\nBest Rewards Card for Balance Transfers: BMO Air Miles Mastercard\n\nAnother excellent no-fee card from BMO, the BMO Air Miles Mastercard offers cardholders the same promotional balance transfer rate of 1.99% for the first 9 months with a 0.99% balance transfer fee. It also offers new cardholders 800 Air Miles, which can be redeemed for travel, merchandise, or in-store discounts at Air Miles partner locations.\n\nIf you\u2019re an Air Miles collector, the BMO Air Miles Mastercard can accelerate your Air Miles earning capacity by allowing you to earn with every purchase, as well as double up your points when you shop at Air Miles partner locations. If you like the perks and balance transfer promotion that BMO has to offer, but you prefer Air Miles rewards over cashback, this is the card for you.\n\nAnnual Fee: $0\n\nMinimum Income: $15,000 personal\n\nInterest Rate: 20.99% on purchases, 22.99% on cash advances (or 21.99% for QU residents)\n\nWelcome Bonus:\n\n0.99% introductory rate on balance transfers for 9 months with a 1% transfer fee\n\n800 bonus Air Miles (this is valued at just over $80 if you choose the Cash Miles option, although Air Miles can be redeemed for travel and merchandise as well)\n\nEarn rate:\n\n3 miles for every $25 spent at Air Miles partners\n\n1 mile for every $12 spent at participating grocery stores\n\nGet double the miles with participating Partners\n\nTravel Insurance: None\n\nPerks:\n\nExtended warranty\n\nPurchase protection\n\nUp to 25% off rentals at participating National Car Rental and Alamo Rent a Car locations\n\n15% off Cirque du Soleil touring shows in Canada, 20% off resident shows in Vegas\n\nBoth BMO cards on our list have excellent balance transfer rates while also offering more generous perks and rewards than low interest cards like the MBNA True Line Mastercard and the CIBC Select Visa. Their promotional (and everyday) interest rates are higher, but depending on your situation, they could strike a perfect balance (pun intended) between a card that helps you manage your existing debt and one that\u2019s good for everyday spending and rewards.\n\nRunner-Up Rewards Card for Best Balance Transfers: PC Financial Mastercard\n\nIf your balance is low enough that you can pay it off in 6 months, and if you shop often at Loblaws-owned stores such as Shoppers Drug Mart, No Frills, or Joe Fresh, the no-fee PC Financial Mastercard deserves a spot on your short list for balance transfer possibilities.\n\nWith 0.97% interest on balance transfers for 6 months, plus rewards that can earn you discounts at Loblaws-owned stores, the PC Financial Mastercard can help you transition from carrying a balance to managing your everyday spending\u2014while also enjoying free groceries! Plus, it\u2019s free, which is always a good thing!\n\nAnnual Fee: $0\n\nMinimum Income: None\n\nInterest Rate: 20.97% on purchases, 22.97% on cash advances\n\nWelcome Bonus:\n\n0.97% promotional balance transfer rate for 6 months\n\nEarn rate:\n\n10 pts/$1 at Loblaws grocery stores\n\n25 pts/$1 at Shoppers\n\n30 pts/litre at Mobil and Esso\n\n20 pts/$1 on PC travel\n\n10 pts/$1 everywhere else\n\nTravel Insurance: MasterCard Global Service replaces your card or offers a cash advance in case of emergencies.\n\nPerks:\n\nPurchase assurance (90 days)\n\nExtended warranty up to an additional year\n\nThe PC Financial Mastercard wins our runner-up spot for best rewards card because, while the balance transfer rate is lower than the BMO Air Miles Mastercard, it only lasts for 6 months \u2013 the shortest period of all the cards on this list. The everyday interest rate is also slightly higher than the other cards. However, if you manage your spending well, the PC Financial Mastercard can help you pay down your balance as well as earn some discounts.\n\nCanadian Balance Transfer Credit Card FAQ\n\nWhat\u2019s the best balance transfer credit card in Canada? All the cards on our list have solid balance transfer offers and are excellent cards to consider. Our favourite is the CIBC Select Visa, which offers a 0% interest rate for 10 months with a 1% transfer fee. What\u2019s the best balance transfer credit card with no transfer fee? The PC Financial Mastercard is the only card on our best balance transfer credit card list with no transfer fee. 1% transfer fees are extremely common\u2014and at 1 cent per dollar of debt transferred, that\u2019s not terrible. What\u2019s the best 0% interest balance transfer offer in Canada? The best 0% interest balance transfer offer in Canada is currently the CIBC Select Visa, which offers 0% interest for 10 months (with a 1% transfer fee). Another great offer is the MBNA True Line Mastercard (0% interest for 12 months with a 3% transfer fee). What\u2019s the best balance transfer card from Scotiabank? The Scotiabank Value Visa card offers 0.99% interest on balance transfers for the first 6 months and 12.99% after that.\n\nChoosing the Best Balance Transfer Credit Card in Canada\n\nIf you end up in a situation where you must carry a balance on your credit card for a little while, transferring your balance to one of Canada\u2019s best balance transfer credit cards can be a great solution. This allows you a little breathing room for 6 months or more, as you\u2019ll only be paying down your principal debt, not accrued interest.\n\nThe best transfer cards on our list each offer you the chance to make payments interest free after you transfer, and some also offer added perks. Choosing the right card for you depends on your repayment timeline, and whether or not you want to benefit from the card even after you\u2019ve paid off your balance.\n\nBecause zero interest is better than any interest at all, the best transfer credit cards are the CIBC Select Visa and the MBNA True Line Mastercard. Both offer a low transfer rate, 0% interest on balance transfers and if you do end up with a balance after the promo period, you\u2019ll pay much less in interest than with other cards.\n\nIf you like the sound of low interest credit cards, check out our full write up on Best Low Interest Credit Cards in Canada.

            "content": "If you ever find yourself in a situation where your low credit score is getting in the way of your goals, don\u2019t worry, there are ways to improve it. With the Best Secured Credit Cards in Canada, you can build your credit score, whether it\u2019s starting at zero or doing a little credit recon.\n\nIn this article, you\u2019ll learn about the best credit cards in Canada for this with low or no credit, how they work, and how they can help you get your credit score back on track.\n\nTop 5 Secure Credit Cards Compared\n\nWhat Exactly Are Secured Credit Cards?\n\nSecured credit cards are designed with two goals in mind:\n\nTo help people with bad credit repair their credit score.\n\nTo help people with no credit build a credit score.\n\nIn the eyes of a credit card company, people with no credit and bad credit both constitute potential risks for lending. If you have no credit, the company has no way of knowing whether you\u2019ll handle their loan responsibly and pay your debt. If you have bad credit, the company can see that you may not have handled your debt responsibly in the past and may be reluctant to issue a credit card for that reason. Secured credit cards take the risk out of the equation for the credit card issuer while still allowing you to build credit (or repair your credit score).\n\nWhen you open a secured credit card, you send a security deposit to the card company, then they issue you a credit card. The credit limit of the card usually starts out as the same amount you sent in, but it\u2019s not a prepaid card \u2013 it\u2019s an actual, working Visa or Mastercard.\n\nThe card company holds the security deposit for you, much like a rental company holds a damage deposit for an apartment. Secured credit cards are called that because the loan you receive is \u201csecured\u201d\u201a\u2014that is, you have given the lender a deposit as collateral to reduce their risk.\n\nYou can use a secured credit card like you would any credit card, being sure to pay your bill monthly. The card company reports to the credit bureaus regularly, which builds your good credit. If you fail to pay your bill, the company closes your card and keeps the security deposit.\n\nHowever, if you keep your account in good standing by paying your bills regularly and on time, and raise your credit score enough, you will eventually be able to qualify for a more traditional (unsecured) credit card and close your secured card. When that happens, the company will return your deposit.\n\nSecured Credit Cards vs. Prepaid Cards\n\nPeople often confuse prepaid cards and secured credit cards because they both involve sending the card company a hefty cheque to use the card. But beyond that similarity (and we understand why that would feel the same) the two cards function very differently.\n\nHere\u2019s a comparison between secured credit cards and prepaid cards to help make the differences clear:\n\nPrepaid Cards:\n\nAre not actually credit cards\n\nYou load them with money and then spend it.\n\nThere is no loan involved, and the company does not report to credit bureaus.\n\nYou cannot use prepaid cards to improve your credit (notice that the correct term is \u201cprepaid card\u201d and not \u201cprepaid credit card\u201d \u2014there\u2019s a reason for that)\n\nSecured credit cards:\n\nYou send the card company a cheque, but it\u2019s set aside.\n\nYou are then issued a secured credit card, which functions just like a regular credit card, with monthly bills and fees.\n\nThe company reports regularly to the credit bureau.\n\nWhen you are finished with the card, you get your deposit back.\n\nYou can use a secured credit card to improve your credit.\n\nIf you feel like a prepaid card might suit your needs better, check out our list of the best prepaid credit cards in Canada.\n\nSecured Credit Cards Pros\n\nYou can often get approved for a secured credit card when you wouldn\u2019t get approved for a standard credit card. Some cards guarantee approval, and they often don\u2019t take your credit rating or income into account.\n\nThey report to credit bureaus\n\nCan help you repair or build your credit\n\nCons:\n\nYou must come up with a security deposit to obtain the card, and that can be a challenge. If you have outstanding debts, you may want to pay those off first\n\nAlmost all secured credit cards have annual fees, and some also have monthly fees\n\nRewards are rare and perks are limited\n\nBest Secured Credit Card in Canada: Neo Secured Credit Card\n\nNeo Financial offers a wide range of products to help customers save, invest and even get a home loan. With the Neo Secured Credit card, you\u2019ll pay nothing in annual or monthly fees. It\u2019s true, there are other no-fee secured credit cards out there, but most of them won\u2019t offer cashback bonuses.\n\nThe Neo Secured Credit card offers 5% cashback when you shop at any of their retail partners. So, shopping on Amazon, your Netflix subscription, getting your daily needs at Walmart, and more, will all earn you 5% cashback.\n\nAnnual Fee: $60\n\nSecurity Deposit: $50 minimum $10,000 maximum\n\nInterest Rate: 19.99% \u2013 26.99% for purchases and 22.99% \u2013 28.99% for cash advances\n\nPerks: 5% cashback on qualifying purchases and a free 0.5% cashback top up if your overall cashback falls below 0.5%.\n\nOn top of the great perks, the Neo Secured Credit card will automatically approve your application without a credit check. For these reasons, the Neo Secured Credit card earns the top spot on our list of the Best Secured Credit Cards in Canada.\n\nBest Secured Credit Card with No Annual Fee: HomeTrust No-Fee Secured Visa\n\nHomeTrust offers two secured credit cards, both of which are featured in this Best Secured Credit Cards list. The Home Trust No-Fee Secured Visa is worth considering because no-fee secured credit cards are rare\u2014as you\u2019ll see on our list, it\u2019s more typical to pay at least $50/year for a card.\n\nDespite charging no annual fee, the HomeTrust No-Fee Secured Credit card offers a 19.99% interest rate, which is on par with any average fixed-rate credit card on the market right now. They\u2019ve been featured on several Best Secured Credit Card lists this year, and it\u2019s easy to see why.\n\nAnnual Fee: $0\n\nSecurity Deposit: $500-$10,000 (credit limit is the same as the security deposit)\n\nInterest Rate: 19.99%\n\nPerks: 90-day purchase security\n\nThe HomeTrust Secured Credit Card is a bare-bones card in terms of perks, offering 90-day purchase security only. However, they do what they do extremely well: offering cardholders with bad or no credit a reliable option that works just like a regular Visa card and doesn\u2019t cost anything other than the security deposit.\n\nNote: this card is not available to residents of Quebec\n\nBest Secured Credit Card with Low Interest: HomeTrust Secured Visa\n\nHomeTrust\u2019s low interest secured credit card option comes with an annual fee of $59 but offers a competitive interest rate of 14.99%. If you\u2019re likely to carry a balance on your card, you could save a significant amount of money with this option, depending on your credit limit.\n\nFor example, a cardholder with a $5,000 balance who pays $200 toward their debt every month will end up paying $1,031.77 in interest with this card, as opposed to $1521.02 on the no-fee card. Even if you factor in several years\u2019 worth of annual fees, that\u2019s still a savings of several hundred dollars.\n\nAnnual Fee: $59\n\nSecurity Deposit: $500-$10,000 (credit limit is the same as the security deposit)\n\nInterest Rate: 14.99%\n\nPerks: 90-day purchase security\n\nHomeTrust has been in business since 1977 and has a reputation for helping Canadians achieve their financial goals. In the case of their secured credit cards, this reputation is well earned. Our editorial team appreciates their commitment to offering a lower interest option for Canadians with bad or no credit.\n\nNote: this card is not available to residents of Quebec\n\nBest Secured Credit Card with Rewards: Plastk Secured Visa Credit Card\n\nMost secured credit cards are designed with a single purpose in mind, which means that perks are generally minimal at best, and rewards are nearly unheard of. The Plastk Secured Credit Card stands out because it gives cardholders rewards earning potential, plus a welcome bonus, and that\u2019s worth celebrating.\n\nPlastk gives cardholders a welcome bonus of 5,000 points (a $20 value) if their account remains in good standing after 3 months. They also give new cardholders 0% APR for the first 3 months. Cardholders earn rewards points for all purchases at a rate of 1 point per dollar spent, with no cap on the amount they can earn. Plastk also offers a referral program that allows cardholders to earn bonus points for sharing their link.\n\nAnnual Fee: $48 plus $6/month maintenance fee ($120 total)\n\nSecurity Deposit: $300-$10,000 (credit limit is the same as the security deposit)\n\nInterest Rate: 17.99%\n\nWelcome Bonus: 0% APR for the first 3 months, 5,000 points ($20 value) after the first 3 months\n\nEarn rate: 1 point per dollar spent, unlimited rewards\n\nPerks:\n\nReferral Program (earn extra rewards points)\n\n25-day grace period\n\nMonthly credit score, credit education, and insights\n\nPlastk\u2019s fees are higher than the other cards on our list: a $48 annual fee plus a $6 maintenance fee, which puts the total fees at $120 annually.\n\nHowever, they do provide cardholders with the feel of a typical credit card that could be worth the cost, especially if rewards are important to you. And with unique perks like a monthly credit score and credit education, plus an interest rate that\u2019s lower than many, it\u2019s earned its spot on our list.\n\nBest Secured Credit Card with Guaranteed Approval and Best Perks: Capital One Guaranteed Secured Mastercard\n\nThe Capital One Guaranteed Mastercard is on this list for two reasons:\n\n1. It actually does have a guaranteed approval.\n\n2. It has the most generous set of perks we found\u2014including travel insurance\n\nSome cards claim to guarantee approval and don\u2019t deliver, but in the case of the Capital One Guaranteed Secured Mastercard, as long as you\u2019re over the age of majority and you don\u2019t have an existing Capital One account, a pending application for one, or a past account not in good standing, you\u2019re good to go.\n\nThe Capital One Guaranteed Secured Mastercard is one of the few secured credit cards that doesn\u2019t necessarily tie your credit limit to the amount of security funds they require. Capital One will process your application and then tell you whether you need to send $75 or $300. Your credit limit may be higher than your deposit. However, this is a double-edged sword: Capital One reserves the right to lower your credit limit at any time without telling you in advance, whereas with other cards, your credit limit is dictated by the amount of your security deposit, and is therefore predictable.\n\nAnnual Fee: $59\n\nSecurity Deposit: $75-300 (credit limit is not necessarily the same as the security deposit)\n\nInterest Rate: 19.8%\n\nTravel Insurance:\n\n250,000 common carrier travel accident insurance\n\nCar rental insurance up to 31 days\n\nUp to $100/day for up to 3 days if baggage is delayed by 4 hours or more\n\nPerks:\n\n60-day Price Protection\n\nPurchase Assurance (120 days)\n\nExtended Warranty (up to 2 years)\n\nThe thing that really stands out for us, in addition to Capital One\u2019s approval guarantee, is their set of perks. Not only does this card offer Price Protection, Purchase Assurance, and an Extended Warranty for up to 2 years (better than many unsecured credit cards out there), it also offers travel insurance.\n\nCapital One Guaranteed Secured Mastercard cardholders and their family members receive common carrier travel accident insurance as well as car rental and baggage insurance.\n\nIt\u2019s not a huge amount of coverage compared to some more premium cards, but it\u2019s nearly unheard of among secured credit cards. Our team appreciates a card that offers something extra, and the Capital One Guaranteed Secured Mastercard does.\n\nHow to Get a Secured Credit Card\n\nRequirements\n\nDue to the nature of the cards, there generally aren\u2019t any set requirements for secured credit cards in Canada. Some cards, like the Neo Secured Credit card, won\u2019t even run a credit check.\n\nHowever, you will be required to make a secured deposit, which depending on the card can be anywhere from $50 to $10,000.\n\nWhen you close your account, you should be entitled to receive your deposit, as long as your account is in good standing.\n\nSome cards, such as the Home Trust Secured Visa card, require some source of income and applicants cannot be in bankruptcy. Others, such as the Plastk Credit Card, do not.\n\nEligibility\n\nLegal residents of Canada over the age of 18 or 19, depending on the province, are eligible to apply for a secured credit card. In addition, you must be able to make the required security deposit amount to start using the card.\n\nApplication Process\n\nThe application process for a secured credit card will be the same as applying for any other credit card. After you have chosen the card you want, simply complete the following steps:\n\nVisit the application page on your chosen secured credit card\u2019s website. Carefully read the terms and conditions so you understand exactly what will be required and how the card works. Fill in the required information, such as your legal name, address, and so on. Once approved, pay the security deposit right away so you can start building your credit as soon as possible.\n\nCanadian Secured Credit Cards FAQ\n\nWhat are secured credit card rates? Interest rates for secured credit cards vary from a no-fee card to $120/year. A fee of around $59-79 is standard. What are the best Canadian secured credit cards for no credit? Many cards advertise guaranteed approval, but our favourite card for someone with no credit is the Capital One Guaranteed Secured Mastercard. What Canadian secured credit card has the lowest deposit? The Capital One Guaranteed Secured Mastercard requires a security deposit of either $75 or $300, for a minimum credit limit of $300. It\u2019s the only card on our list which is known to give cardholders a credit limit greater than the amount of their deposit. Can you add money to a secured credit card? Be sure to check the individual card you\u2019re looking at, but it\u2019s a common practice for secured credit card companies to allow cardholders to raise their credit limit by sending additional security funds.\n\nCanadian Secured Credit Cards Comparison: Final Verdict\n\nThere are a number of great secured credit cards on offer to help those with no or low credit start building up to an excellent credit score. The great thing is that the options reviewed in this comparison won\u2019t penalize you with over the top fees and interest rates.\n\nAll things considered, if you like the idea of earning cashback or other rewards while you build your credit, the Neo Secured Credit and Plastk are great choices.\n\nIf low interest rates are more important to you, as you want to save while paying down your balance, then you might be better off with the HomeTrust Annual Fee Secured Visa.\n\nThe sooner you start building credit with one of these Visa or Mastercard backed cards, the sooner you can reach those important life milestones. Think of these cards as a stepping stone to bigger and better options that await once your credit score is solid.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, check out some of The Best Free Rewards Credit Cards or The Best Low Interest Credit Cards to learn how you will be able to benefit even more from those good credit habits.",

This is a solid card whether you rent or not.\n\nBut the card is becoming even more valuable with the addition of special spend bonuses on Rent Day, the first day of each month.

But if you do need to top off your account and don\u2019t want to spend money purchasing Hilton points outright, today would be the day to initiate the transfer.\n\nSoulcycle X, Ride Together Classes\n\nBilt Rewards is partnering with SoulCycle to host one \u201cRent Day, Ride Together\u201d class on the first of every month at over 50 SoulCycle locations nationwide, allowing members to book a class and receive a complimentary bike for a friend.

Retail sales grew by 3.8 percent compared to 2023, with the final five days of the holiday season contributing 10 percent of total holiday spending.\n\nA well-rounded holiday spending trend was also noticed this season, with increased consumer interest in experiences such as dining out, leading to a 6.3 percent rise in restaurant spending compared to last year. Spending on consumer goods also grew, with key gift-giving categories like apparel (3.6 percent), jewelry (4.0 percent), and electronics (3.7 percent) showing notable year-over-year growth.\n\nUnsurprisingly, consumers also leaned heavily toward digital-first shopping this holiday season, favoring e-commerce, curbside pick-up, and delivery options. Online retail sales saw a 6.7 percent year-over-year increase, outpacing the 2.9 percent growth in in-store sales. The apparel sector stood out, leading the way in e-commerce with a 6.7 percent rise in online purchases compared to last year, underscoring an appetite for newness in fashion. Although online shopping was popular nationwide during the holidays, selected cities fully embraced e-commerce. Tampa (10.6 percent) and Phoenix (10.0 percent) saw impressive double-digit growth, with Minneapolis (8.9 percent), Dallas (8.4 percent), Charlotte (7.9 percent), Orlando (7.8 percent), and Houston (7.6 percent) also exceeding the national e-commerce sales growth compared to 2023.\n\n\"This holiday season, we saw consumers motivated by deals and retailers respond with promotions to meet the demand,\" said Steve Sadove, senior advisor for Mastercard and former CEO and chairman of Saks Incorporated, in a statement. \"The value-minded consumer showed up to shop at brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce platforms, with retailers managing across both to capture attention throughout the season.\"",

V falling 1.05%, Mastercard Inc. MA dropping 1.25%, and American Express Co. AXP declining 1.24%.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump proposed a 10% cap on credit card interest rates. Great idea.

Great idea. Let's see if he supports the legislation that I will introduce to do just that. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) December 30, 2024\n\nThe proposed cap would mark a significant reduction from the current average rate of 21.5%, according to Federal Reserve data. Trump first introduced the idea during a recent campaign rally at Nassau Coliseum, where he told a crowd of 16,000 that rates of 25% to 30% were unacceptable.\n\nThe initiative comes as U.S. credit card lenders wrote off $46 billion in seriously delinquent loan balances during the first nine months of 2024, a 50% increase from the previous year, according to BankRegData.\n\n\u201cHigh-income households are fine, but the bottom third of U.S. consumers are tapped out,\u201d said Mark Zandi, head of Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cTheir savings rate right now is zero.\u201d\n\nSee Also: Bill Ackman Questions Stock Market Closure To Honor Jimmy Carter, Calls It \u2018Shutting Down Commerce\u2019\n\nWhy It Matters: Industry groups have expressed strong opposition to the proposal. The Consumer Bankers Association warned that government-imposed price controls would particularly harm lower-income Americans, potentially forcing them to turn to riskier alternatives like payday lenders.\n\nCapital One Financial Corp. COF, the nation\u2019s third-largest credit card lender, reported its annualized credit card write-off rate increased to 6.1% in November, up from 5.2% a year ago.\n\nDespite lenders writing off nearly $60 billion in consumer credit card debt over the past year, another $37 billion remains overdue by at least one month.\n\nOdysseas Papadimitriou, head of the consumer credit research firm WalletHub, highlighted that consumer spending power has been weakened. Despite nearly $60 billion in consumer credit card debt being written off in the past year, an additional $37 billion remains overdue by at least one month.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage Via Unsplash\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

An annual household membership to the Admirals Club alone can cost as much as $1,650.\n\nBecause complimentary lounge access allows 2 guests or immediate family to enter with the cardholder, this access benefit can be effectively the same as having a household membership, especially since you can add a family member as an authorized user and your entire traveling party, related or not, can have access ($175 each per year).\n\nIf lounge access isn\u2019t important to you, but you still frequent American Airlines, the Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae World Elite\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae with its annual fee of $0 intro annual fee, $99 after the first year, might be a good alternative selection for an AAdvantage-branded credit card.\n\nOr if you fly a lot of different airlines, find value in earning rewards, and enjoy receiving additional travel benefits, a general travel rewards credit card could be a viable consideration.",

Both the publicly traded companies recently suffered a major setback as they were directed by an American court to pay whopping $197 million to card holders.\n\nAccording to the information available, an American court had earlier this year directed VISA and Mastercard to return the money that they deducted from their users and customers' cards in the name of additional fees.\n\nThe American court in its order termed the additional fees collected by the two companies from their users as illegal.\n\nWhile VISA will pay $104.6 million to its customers, Mastercard will refund $92.8 million to card holders as part of the settlement, reports said.\n\nVISA or Mastercard ATM users in the US are required to pay extra fees whenever they withdraw money from the ATM. The court in its ruling declared the extra fee as illegal and ordered VISA and Mastercard to refund the amount. The settlement of $197 million involves consumers who withdrew cash from bank-operated ATMs since 2007.\n\nIt is worth noting here that not all VISA and Mastercard users will get the refunds. The two refund requirements are:\n\n1. Card users paid a non-refundable surcharge while using an ATM in the US (VISA or Mastercard debit) card between October 1, 2007 and July 26, 2024.\n\n2. Fee must be charged by a bank in the VISA or Mastercard ATM network, such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo or Bank of America.\n\nAs per details available, VISA charges the card issuer on a per-transaction basis or based on the card volume. On the other hand, Mastercard charges institutions (that issue cards) based on the percentage of global dollar volume (total volume of all transactions made using cards within a specific period).\n\nEnd of article",

These new benefits went into effect on July 23, 2023, impacting all new and existing cardholders.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAAdvantage Executive World Elite Card Changes\n\nThere are a variety of new benefits coming to the card, some in the form of statement credits, and others in the form of insurance protections.

After you reach 50,000 Loyalty Points in a year, you\u2019ll get a 10,000 Loyalty Point boost. If you reach 90,000 Loyalty Points, you\u2019ll get another 10,000 Loyalty Points. What isn\u2019t clear is whether earning these Loyalty Points is based on general earning, such as flying American Airlines, or whether it must be earned via the credit card.\n\nNew Travel Insurance Protections\n\nWe don\u2019t know the details of each coverage just yet, as each protection will come with a coverage limit:\n\nTrip cancellation and interruption protection\n\nTrip delay protection\n\nLost baggage protection\n\nWorldwide car rental insurance, though it is not clear whether this is primary or secondary insurance as there is a major difference between the 2\n\nIncreased Annual Fee and Authorized User Fee\n\nPrior to July 23, 2023, the AAdvantage Executive World Elite card had a $450 annual fee. As of July 23, 2023, the annual fee of this card increases to $595 a year.\n\nPlus, authorized users, who also get Admirals Club access, will need to pay $175 per year starting July 23, 2023. This is a substantial change, as the AAdvantage Executive World Elite card was previously one of the best travel cards for authorized users. Prior to July 23, 2023, cardholders could add up to 10 authorized users for no additional charge.\n\nIn exchange for the higher fees, American Airlines is promising better and more substantial food offerings, to debut in select Admirals Clubs at the end of this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHot Tip: The cost for an Admirals Club membership is increasing to $850 a year, so holding this credit card is still a better value for Admirals Club access.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to see the AAdvantage Executive World Elite card\u2018s annual fee increase, there are several new additions to American\u2019s most premium card that may make it worthwhile, including rideshare credits, rental car credits, and insurance protections.",

            "content": "Sales rose this year during the holiday shopping season even as Americans wrestled with elevated prices for many groceries and other necessities, according to new data.\n\nHoliday sales from the beginning of November through Christmas Eve climbed 3.8%, outpacing the 3.1% increase from a year earlier, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks all kinds of payments including cash and debit cards. The last five days of the season accounted for 10% of the spending.\n\nThis year, retailers were even more under the gun to get shoppers in to buy early and in bulk since there were five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nMichelle Meyer, chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute, said the holiday shopping season \"revealed a consumer who is willing and able to spend but driven by a search for value\" as seen by concentrated online spending during the biggest promotional periods.\n\nSales growth was higher than the 3.2% increase Mastercard SpendingPulse had projected this fall. The data released Thursday excludes the automotive industry and is not adjusted for inflation.\n\nClothing sales rose 3.6%, with most of the growth being fueled by online shopping. Spending on restaurants, and sales of electronics and jewelry also grew. Online sales jumped 6.7% from a year ago and in-person spending rose 2.9%.\n\nConsumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. economic activity and economists carefully monitor how Americans use their money, particularly during the holidays, to gauge how they're feeling financially.\n\nThe most recent government data on consumer spending, released on Dec. 17, showed shoppers stepped up activity at retail stores last month. But auto dealer sales drove most of those gains as huge storms created a need for new cars in parts of the southeast slammed by Hurricane Helene in October. Big discounts at many retail chains also attracted shoppers.\n\nBut the report also hinted at some consumer caution as sales at grocery stores, clothing shops, and restaurants fell. Outside of car dealers and online retailers, sales gains were modest.\n\nRetailers felt more pressure this year due to the shorter holiday shopping period, and also from a presidential election that captured the attention of many consumers. Sales of general merchandise slid 9% in the two weeks ended Nov. 9, according to Circana, a market research group. Sales have been rebounding but stores will have to make up for those losses.\n\nA broader picture of how Americans are spending their money arrives next month when the National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail trade group, releases its combined two-month statistics based on November-December sales figures from the Commerce Department.\n\nThe group expects that shoppers will have made $979.5 billion to $989 billion worth of purchases in November and December, which would represent a 2.5%-3.5% increase over the same two-month period a year ago. That would be a slower rate than the 3.9% increase from holiday 2023 over holiday 2022 season.\n\nOverall, retailers had a decent start to the unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping period despite lots of discounts that started as early as October.\n\nBy ANNE D'INNOCENZIO and HALELUYA HADERO AP Business Writers",

In St. Louis, data scientists are on a mission to remove unintended bias from the surveys that assess the level of need for the homeless. And 5,000 miles away, in Warsaw, Poland, women entrepreneurs who fled war-torn Ukraine started rebuilding their lives and livelihoods with the support of a small business development program that included free childcare.\n\nAt Mastercard, we\u2019re proud of the small role we play, alongside a laudable cast of public and private partners, in building a society where everyone has the tools and support needed to thrive. Here are some of the ways we\u2019ve made a difference together this year.\n\nAlice Halter wants to live in a city where everyone does well. That\u2019s what drove the senior product design specialist at Mastercard\u2019s Tech Hub in Manhattan to volunteer her time and expertise improving user experience on Access HRA, New York City\u2019s Human Resources Administration portal, through which residents in need can access a host of public benefits and assistance, including food benefits, Medicaid and home energy relief.\n\nHalter connected to the project through Unlocked, Mastercard\u2019s AI-driven career development platform, launched in 2021, which matches employees with short-term projects, volunteer opportunities, mentoring and customized educational offerings. When Unlocked announced an innovative public-private partnership with the New York City Mayor\u2019s Office and NYC Service in March, Halter, who spends her work hours designing seamless user experiences for Mastercard\u2019s cybersecurity business, knew right away that she wanted to pitch in.\n\nHer focus for the city\u2019s Department of Social Services is accessibility \u2014 and for the two million people NYC DSS serves, there\u2019s a great deal at stake. \u201cEveryone has to be able to use this platform, whether they have just learned how to use a computer, don\u2019t speak English or have an auditory processing or visual impairment,\u201d Halter says. \u201cEase of use can determine whether or not someone gets benefits that they not only need but have a right to.\u201d\n\nMastercard data scientists were already helping St. Louis police and social services assess their Crisis Response Unit when the city sought solutions for another critical problem: improving services for unhoused people to identify disparities and accelerate inclusion. Since unintended biases came to light in the widely used Vulnerability Index, a questionnaire used across the country to help measure need and allocate housing, the city of St. Louis developed its own survey in hopes of avoiding similar problems and administering a fairer process.\n\nMastercard experts worked pro bono in partnership with the Institute for Community Alliances, the nonprofit that maintains St. Louis\u2019s homeless management information system, to analyze the anonymized responses of nearly 5,000 clients \u2014 and uncovered some unexpected issues the city is now working to address. For example, the findings showed that Black respondents were underrepresented among the survey\u2019s high scorers, who are considered most critically in need.\n\nThe volunteers went further to understand how these disparities arose. For instance, lower scores on a section that asks about medical diagnoses and prescriptions may be linked to Black Americans\u2019 greater distrust of the health care system, so the survey creators are revising these questions to account for their experiences. Ensuring that people can access housing services through a system they trust \u201call starts with this assessment,\u201d says Kathy Connors, executive director of St. Louis emergency shelter Gateway180. \u201cThis work is critical for giving fair entry to the people who need it most.\u201d\n\nPolina Khlibanovska and her young son were among more than a million Ukrainian women and children who fled to neighboring Poland since Russia began its assault in 2022. With extensive experience in childcare but less knowledge in starting a business \u2014 let alone navigating permits and financing in a new country \u2014 Khlibanovska could only depend on one thing: She would stop at nothing to provide a better life for herself and her child.\n\nAfter seeing it advertised, Khlibanovska was one of 1,500 women to apply for (Re)building Ukrainian Business, a small business program run by Poland\u2019s Impact Foundation and supported by the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth. She was one of 80 to be accepted into the yearlong program. Now, thanks to the legal, business and financial support she received through the program, Khlibanovska's venture, Smart Kindergarten Warsaw, is thriving in her new home, employing other women, and she's looking to expand.\n\nThe women in the program were \u201cfull of energy and motivated to start a new life,\u201d said Emilia Borkowska, project manager for the Impact Foundation. To ensure they felt comfortable and safe in their new environment, and to better equip them to succeed in business and beyond, (Re)building Ukrainian Business provided free childcare for families in the program.\n\nEntrepreneurship \u2014 like motherhood \u2014 can be a tumultuous journey, but it\u2019s one that the women in the program now feel ready to tackle. \u201cEven when you have a bad day,\u201d Khlibanovska says, \u201cthe next day, the wings open up again, and you fly.\u201d",

This comes after a class action lawsuit accused both companies of charging excessive fees at ATMs. What you read! A class action lawsuit has denounced them for charging fees for withdrawing your own money from their ATMs. And now they will be forced to pay 197.5 million to the affected users\n\nWhy is there this refund agreement?\n\nA court has ruled it illegal to charge extra fees for using banks associated with Visa and Mastercard, which, although these companies do not issue cards or set fees, have been accused of charging an unspecified amount of money for withdrawing money and paying with one\u2019s own credit or debit card.\n\nSo, to avoid a trial that would be too long, both companies have agreed to pay the aforementioned sum to those affected, although they have not admitted any liability (something very common in this type of legal agreement).\n\nHow will the funds be distributed?\n\nThe amount of the refund will not be split 50-50, but Visa will contribute USD 104.6 million and Mastercard will contribute USD 92.8 million.\n\nFor each consumer, it will depend on the rates this event has had on their personal finances during the period of time they were charged for these \u201cextras.\u201d\n\nHow do I know if I can claim a refund?\n\nNot all users of both companies will be able to access these payments, but there are two main requirements:\n\nHaving paid an unrefunded surcharge when using an ATM in the US with a Visa or Mastercard debit card between October 1, 2007 and July 26, 2024.\n\nThe fee must have been charged by a bank in the Visa or Mastercard ATM network, such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo or Bank of America.\n\nThe agreement also defines who will not be eligible for this payment, and that is, if you have already received a previous refund for these fees or if your card was issued outside the United States, you will not be able to request this payment, but if you participated in previous agreements and received refunds, you could file a new claim for surcharges charged after those compensations!\n\nAre there deadlines to apply for reimbursement?\n\nYes, put this on your calendar:\n\nDeadline to file a claim: January 22, 2025. Final hearing to approve the settlement: January 24, 2025.\n\nBe sure to submit your application before the deadline to ensure your participation in the reimbursement!!\n\nHow can I apply for a claim?\n\nThree easy steps await you to request your refund:\n\nVisit the official class action website.\n\nComplete the online form or download it to mail in.\n\nProvide your contact information and sign under oath that you paid excessive fees.\n\nSend the form to:\n\nATM Surcharge Settlement\n\nPO Box 170500\n\nMilwaukee, WI 5321\n\nAlthough they don\u2019t specify that they need additional information or proof, don\u2019t rule out that you may be contacted to provide more information during the eligibility process.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this opportunity to receive money that has been illegally taken from you.

            "content": "Posted on //\n\nUpdate for Rent Day 1/1. For Rent Day on New Years Day, Wednesday 1/1, Bilt Rewards is offering the following additional perks. If you are a renter, this program offers steady stream of free monthly points and a variety of promotional perks.\n\nAccor All Elite Status through end of 2025. Accor Limitless Live (ALL) is a hotel rewards program that is mostly in Europe, but they also operate some excellent Fairmont Hotels in the US and Canada. You must first be enrolled in Accor Limitless Live (\u201cALL\u201d) to participate in this Accor Status Match Offer. Do this first and don\u2019t forget to activate your free status on the 1st.\n\nEven the base Bilt Blue level gets you Accor Silver Status through the end of 2025, which otherwise would require 800 Euros of spending or 10 nights of stays. Accor Silver gets you Priority Check-in, Late Checkout, and a Welcome Drink. Higher Bilt levels can get higher Accor levels if you spend some Bilt points.\n\nAccor is also a Bilt points transfer partner and actually a good value redemption for stays at Fairmont hotels. Accor has a fixed redemption of 1,000 Accor points = 20\u20ac of value towards a hotel stay. Bilt points transfer to Accor at a 3:2 ratio. At current currency exchange rates, this means 3,000 Bilt points = 2,000 Accor points = 40 Euros of value = $41.61 of value. That works out to a 1.4 cent value per Bilt point, which is not bad. I might still prefer a Hyatt hotel redemption, but it\u2019s worth shopping around depending your specific date and location.\n\nRent Day always means their 2X double points promo where you can get 6X on dining, 4X on travel, and 2X on other purchases (except rent). As of October 2024, there is now a cap of 1,000 bonus points, so it\u2019s not as exciting as before. Really, I just try to remember to put any dining on the card on that day for some extra Hyatt points.\n\nYou can still earn lots of Bilt points just for paying monthly rent to any landlord with no transaction fees, which is their most important feature. I don\u2019t know the status of all the other smaller bonuses listed below for new customers.\n\nJust joined recently? Look for these free Bilt Points opportunities (any day). Bilt lets you earn bonus points for a variety of different small activities, which can add up to 1,000+ easy points. I don\u2019t know if these are officially listed anywhere, but I got them.\n\nAfter I first got approved for the Bilt card, they offered me 5X Bilt points on all purchases (except rent) for a limited period of time (reader Eileen reports 5 days). This is a good opportunity to earn 5X points for everyday larger purchases like insurance, tax payment, charitable giving, or utility bills. Max 50,000 points.\n\n(reader Eileen reports 5 days). This is a good opportunity to earn 5X points for everyday larger purchases like insurance, tax payment, charitable giving, or utility bills. Max 50,000 points. 100 points for linking each transfer partner. Link Hyatt? 100 points. Link Air Canada Aeroplan? 100 points. Link them all! 10+ partners = 1,000+ points.\n\nLink Hyatt? 100 points. Link Air Canada Aeroplan? 100 points. Link them all! 10+ partners = 1,000+ points. 500 points for Amazon Shop with Points. Link your Amazon account and you can buy stuff with Bilt points at the usual mediocre 0.7 cents per points value. Linking gets you 250 points, and using the program (spend at least 1 Bilt point) and get another 250 Bilt points.\n\nLink your Amazon account and you can buy stuff with Bilt points at the usual mediocre 0.7 cents per points value. Linking gets you 250 points, and using the program (spend at least 1 Bilt point) and get another 250 Bilt points. 100 points for each credit card linked to Bilt Dining (up to 300 points). Bilt Dining lets you earn 5X points per dollar when you pay at an eligible restaurant using a linked credit card. Link three different credit cards, get 300 Bilt points.\n\nImportant reminder: You must use your card to make 5 purchases (of any amount) each statement period to earn points.\n\nFull review:\n\nThe updated Bilt Mastercard is a unique credit card that earns rewards on rent payments to any landlord. Bilt is a rent payment platform and they will send your landlord a check or ACH bank transfer so that your landlord will not have to do anything. The credit card itself is issued by Wells Fargo. Bilt has bonus categories and a variety of points redemption options like many other rewards credit cards. Here are the highlights:\n\nUp to 1X points spent on rent payments without the transaction fee, up to 100,000 points each calendar year.\n\nwithout the transaction fee, up to 100,000 points each calendar year. 3X points on dining.\n\n2X points on travel including hotels, rental cars, and cruises when booked directly with airlines, hotels, and car rental agencies.\n\nincluding hotels, rental cars, and cruises when booked directly with airlines, hotels, and car rental agencies. 1X points on other purchases.\n\nEarn points when you make 5 transactions that post each statement period.\n\nWhen renting at a Bilt Alliance property, you can choose to have your rent payments automatically reported by Bilt to the three major credit bureaus each month; Experian(TM), TransUnion(TM), and Equifax(TM).\n\nNo annual fee.\n\nWorld Elite Mastercard perks like cell phone insurance and purchase protection.\n\nThat means your rent can be up to $100,000 per year ($8,333 per month) and you would still be able to take full advantage of the 1X points per dollar spent on rent payments. They do require you to make at least 5 transactions per month (rent can be one), otherwise too many people might just put their rent on the card and not use the card otherwise.\n\nBilt has partnered with the owners of over 2,000,000 apartment units to create the Bilt Rewards Alliance. The easiest way is find out if you live in a qualifying property is to simply type in your address into the Bilt app.\n\nBilt also offers Double Points on \u201cRent Day\u201d, aka the 1st of every month. This means that on the 1st day of every month, you can get 6X on dining, 4X on travel, and 2X on other purchases(except rent). They also offer other promos on this day.\n\nBilt Rewards Points redemption options\n\nTravel partners. Bilt Rewards points transfer on a 1:1 basis to the following hotel and airline partners. You can also get 100 bonus points for every loyalty program you link to Bilt.\n\nAlaska Airlines Mileage Plan (NEW)\n\n(NEW) Air Canada Aeroplan\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nHawaiian Airlines\n\nFlyingBlue (Air France/KLM)\n\nMiles & Smiles (Turkish Airlines)\n\nEmirates Skywards\n\nCathay Pacific Asia Miles\n\nBritish Airways Executive Club\n\nVirgin Atlantic Flying Club\n\nAer Lingus Aer Club\n\nTurkish Miles & Smiles\n\nIberia Plus\n\nTAP Air Portugal\n\n\n\nWorld of Hyatt\n\nIHG One\n\nAccor ALL\n\nHyatt hotel points, Alaska, United, and Hawaiian miles are likely the most useful points for the average US traveler. I am conservative when valuing points and miles due to their redemption hassles and steady threat of devaluation, so I would place the value here a 1 cent a point even though I definitely plan to exceed that. You may wish to use a different value.\n\nHome Downpayment? Bilt says that your points can be redeemed at 1.5 cents per point when used towards a home downpayment. This seems like it might be rather complicated to actually redeem, so I would keep it mind but wouldn\u2019t count on it. If you racked up 100,000 points over time, it would be nice to have $1,500 via this method.\n\nShop with Points at Amazon. You can link your Bilt Rewards points to Amazon and pay for your purchases at rate of 0.70 cents per point.\n\nRent. Bilt will let you convert points towards your next rent payment at 0.55 cents per point. This is not a good redemption rate when compared to the miles/Hyatt option. It\u2019s too bad there is no easy, decent cash-out option.\n\nStatement credit. Bilt will also let you convert points towards a statement credit on your credit card statement at 0.55 cents per point.\n\nOther options include fitness classes or physical items like \u201climited-edition\u201d home decor or art in the \u201cBilt Collection\u201d catalog. Personally, I like being able to add to my Hyatt and Canada Aeroplan stash.\n\nPossibly help your credit score? When renting at a Bilt Alliance property, your on-time payment activity can be automatically reported to the three major credit bureaus. In addition, with the optional \u201cBiltProtect\u201d feature, your rent payments will be immediately withdrawn from a linked bank account so your credit limit is not decreased (and ideally your rent won\u2019t contribute to your credit card debt).\n\nHow do I pay my landlord or property manager? They don\u2019t take credit cards due to the transaction fees. Bilt will provide you with a bank ACH routing number and account number that you can use to perform an ACH transfer, or they will simply send a paper check on your behalf. You don\u2019t actually pay with the credit card, nor do you or your landlord have to pay any credit card transaction fees.\n\nFree cell phone protection. Pay your monthly cell phone bill with your Bilt Mastercard and get up to $800 of protection (subject to $25 deductible) against covered damage or theft. For complete coverage details, visit wellsfargo.com/biltbenefits. To file a claim, call 1-800-316-8051 or visit mycardbenefits.assurant.com.\n\nBottom line. The Bilt Mastercard offers a unique rewards structure targeted specifically at all renters with any landlord. At $2,000 a month in rent, the 1X rewards would add up to 24,000 points per year in rewards = 24,000 Alaska/United/Hawaiian miles or 24,000 Hyatt points with no additional transaction fees and no credit card annual fee. You may even do better if you wait for a \u201cRent Day\u201d promo on the first of the month. Something to consider if you already have to pay rent anyway.",
