            "content": "A group of barren, uninhabited volcanic islands near Antarctica, covered in glaciers and home to penguins, have been swept up in Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, as the US president hit them with a 10% tariff on goods.\n\nHeard Island and McDonald Islands, which form an external territory of Australia, are among the remotest places on Earth, accessible only via a two-week boat voyage from Perth on Australia\u2019s west coast. They are completely uninhabited, with the last visit from people believed to be nearly 10 years ago.\n\nNevertheless, Heard and McDonald islands featured in a list released by the White House of \u201ccountries\u201d that would have new trade tariffs imposed.\n\nThe Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said on Thursday: \u201cNowhere on Earth is safe.\u201d\n\nHeard Island and McDonald Islands are among several \u201cexternal territories\u201d of Australia listed separately in the tariff list to Australia, which will see a 10% tariff imposed on its goods.\n\nExternal territories are part of Australia and not self-governing but have a unique relationship with the federal government. Such territories featured on the White House list were the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Norfolk Island.\n\nNorfolk Island, which has a population of 2,188 people and lies 1,600km (1,000 miles) north-east of Sydney, was slugged with a tariff of 29% \u2013 19 percentage points higher than the rest of Australia.\n\nIn 2023, Norfolk Island exported US$655,000 (A$1.04m) worth of goods to the US, with its main export being US$413,000 (A$658,000) worth of leather footwear, according to Observatory of Economic Complexity data.\n\nBut George Plant, the administrator of Norfolk Island, disputed the data. He told the Guardian: \u201cThere are no known exports from Norfolk Island to the United States and no tariffs or known non-tariff trade barriers on goods coming to Norfolk Island.\u201d\n\nAlbanese said on Thursday: \u201cNorfolk Island has got a 29% tariff. I\u2019m not quite sure that Norfolk Island, with respect to it, is a trade competitor with the giant economy of the United States, but that just shows and exemplifies the fact that nowhere on Earth is safe from this.\u201d\n\nThe export figures from Heard Island and McDonald Islands are even more perplexing. The territory does have a fishery but no buildings or human habitation whatsoever.\n\nDespite this, according to export data from the World Bank, the US imported US$1.4m (A$2.23m) of products from Heard Island and McDonald Islands in 2022, nearly all of which was \u201cmachinery and electrical\u201d imports. It was not immediately clear what those goods were.\n\nIn the five years prior, imports from Heard Island and McDonald Islands ranged from US$15,000 (A$24,000) to US$325,000 (A$518,000) per year.\n\nThe White House, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian Antarctic Division were contacted for comment.",

            "content": "Before I went in for that highly-anticipated first bite, I removed the top bun of my Filet-O-Fish to get a better idea of what makes the fishy fast-food classic tick. Honestly, I was a little bit taken aback. The tartar sauce only existed on about 40% of the sandwich, leaving the remainder bone-dry. When I lifted up the fish patty to locate the elusive cheese, I had to laugh at the sight of it. A tiny, paper-thin, rectangular sliver of yellow cheese was semi-melted onto one side of the bottom bun \u2014 the opposite side that had the tartar sauce. It was both comical and sad.\n\nLo and behold, the Filet-O-Fish tasted exactly as it looked. The first thing I noticed was how utterly bland it was. Instead of having a buttery, wheat-like taste, the buns were nearly identical to cheap white bread. Meanwhile, the famous zesty tang of tartar sauce was all but nonexistent; it might as well have been mayonnaise. As for the fish patty, I tasted almost nothing outside of a very mild fishy flavor and a hint of salt.\n\nThe sandwich's only redeeming quality was the texture of the fish. The Alaskan pollock clearly held up well to frying, and it stayed flakey without falling apart. However, it needed something \u2014 anything \u2014 with even a hint of flavor and crunch. The breading wasn't crispy, so crunchy lettuce, onions, or pickles would have been much appreciated. The cheese was too minuscule to provide any real flavor, and the little it did contribute wasn't exactly welcome. All told, I was beyond disappointed in this disgraceful excuse for seafood.",

U.S. stocks tanked Thursday morning as several countries warned of retaliation and the threat of a global trade war loomed.\n\nBut two remote islands, only inhabited by wildlife like seals and penguins, were also caught in the tariff crosshairs. Here is what we know:\n\nMore: Senate rebukes Trump on Canada tariffs, with 4 Republicans joining Democrats\n\nUninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands hit with 10% tariff\n\nToward the end of a long list of charts displaying the reciprocal tariffs, as shared by the White House on X, Heard and McDonald Islands are listed as being hit with a 10% reciprocal tariff.\n\nThe islands are located between Australia, South Africa and the Antarctic continent. They are conserved for their \"pristine island ecosystems\" with a rare combination of sub-Antarctic islands and active volcanoes, according to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention.\n\nThe Australian territory, more than twice the size of Washington, D.C., is uninhabited by people and primarily used for research, according to the CIA.\n\nHowever, it does have thriving wildlife largely untouched by people, with several populations of bird species, seals and penguins.\n\nThe islands were named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1997.\n\nGlobal trade war tensions rise; stock markets react\n\nAustralia was also hit with a 10% reciprocal tariff, according to the White House chart. Other Australian territories were also named, including Norfolk Island, Cocos Island and Christmas Island, which together have a population of less than 5,000 people, according to CNBC.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment about the tariff on the uninhabited islands.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese reacted to the tariff news Thursday, saying it was \"not the act of a friend.\" He added that the country wouldn't issue retaliatory tariffs, according to Reuters.\n\nOther countries, however, seem poised to fight back. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the EU would issue countermeasures without specifying. China has also said it would issue countermeasures, Reuters reported.\n\nU.S. stocks opened low Thursday, and companies that import their goods from countries most impacted by Trump's recent orders saw some of the sharpest declines.\n\nContributing: Medora Lee, John Bacon, Joey Garrison\n\nKinsey Crowley is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

Future Wildcat Malachi Moreno had nine points, five rebounds and two blocks in 16:26 for the East team.\n\nUltimately, Brown and the West squad ended on top, notching a 105-92 victory at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nNot surprisingly, the three best players in the 2025 class \u2014 in terms of recruiting rankings \u2014 were three of the best players on the floor Tuesday.\n\nAJ Dybantsa, a BYU signee and the country's top-ranked 2025 prospect, finished with 17 points for the West team. Cameron Boozer, the No. 2 player in the 247Sports Composite rankings, had 16 and a game-high 12 rebounds for the East. But they both took a back seat to Darryn Peterson. The Kansas signee, and the No. 3 recruit in the 2025 cycle, led all scorers with 18 points in the win for the West.\n\nAfterward, Boozer and Peterson were named the game's co-MVPs.\n\nNate Ament, a 6-foot-9 forward from Virginia who is the highest-ranked uncommitted player in the 2025 cycle and has both Pat Kelsey and Mark Pope's programs among his five finalists, ended with 12 points and three rebounds in 20:45 for the East team.\n\nAment was originally planning to decide among Louisville, Kentucky, Arkansas, Duke and Tennessee on Tuesday but said Monday he was pushing back the announcement to a later, unspecified date.\n\nThere was some Kentucky flavor Tuesday in the girls game, too; with former Sacred Heart star ZaKiyah Johnson, Bethlehem High School's Leah Macy and UK signee Kaelyn Carroll on the East team. They came up on the wrong end of the scoreboard, however: 104-82.\n\nAfter the West ran out to an 18-0 lead, Johnson was a big reason why the East got back in the game. The four-time state champion and Kentucky's reigning Miss Basketball, who's signed to play at LSU, scored a team-high nine points during the second quarter and grabbed a couple of rebounds before the break; at which point her squad trailed 54-45.\n\nBehind 16 points from MVP Sienna Betts, a UCLA signee, the West was too much to overcome in the second half. It closed by winning the fourth quarter, 25-16.\n\nJohnson finished with 11 points on 5-for-14 shooting (1 for 3 from 3-point range) to go along with four rebounds, two steals and an assist in 22:11 of run. Carroll, a product of Tabor Academy in Massachusetts, had three points, two rebounds and an assist in 15:50. Macy, a Notre Dame signee who is still recovering from a right knee injury, did not play.\n\nThe Courier Journal brought you live updates, scores, highlights and analysis throughout the game.

The former scored a game-high 18 points for the West; while the latter had 16 for the East.\n\nAfter a back-and-forth third quarter, the West owns a four-point lead, 74-70, against the East entering the final period.\n\nMoreno had four points in the quarter, upping his total to seven. Brown didn't score in the third stanza, remaining at three points.\n\nTwo Houston signees dominated the quarter: Isiah Harwell had 11 points, while Chris Cenac had nine. Neither player scored a point in the first half.\n\nThrough three periods, Duke signee Cameron Boozer leads all players with 14 points, followed by Darius Acuff (an Arkansas signee) with 13 and Niko Bundalo (a Washington signee) with 12. Top-ranked 2025 prospect AJ Dybantsa, who's headed to BYU, has 11. Ament has seven points.\n\nThe West extended its lead over the East to eight at halftime with a 24-19 second quarter. Fourteen of its points during the period were unanswered.\n\nBrown and Moreno finished the half with three points apiece. The former's facilitating for the West caught the eyes of Adam Finkelstein, 247Sports' director of scouting; and the latter came up with a block for the East at the end of the first quarter.\n\nAment chipped in five points for the East.\n\nRepresenting the West, AJ Dybantsa led all scorers with nine points.

Joining them on the roster is UK commit Carroll, a 6-2 wing.\n\nBrown won the McDonald's All-American Game's 3-point contest Monday, besting girls champion Aaliyah Chavez with a record-setting 28 points during the final round. For his last shot, the point guard went with a no-look trey.\n\nBrown then proceeded to shout out Louisville during an interview after the competition. Here's a replay:\n\nWith the news of Ament pushing back his commitment, here's what Brown and Moreno had to say about recruiting him to their respective schools during the McDonald's All-American Game festivities:\n\n\"I've been talking to Nate every single day about it, honestly,\" Brown said. \"At the end of the day, it's his decision; so I think it just comes down to him and his family. But, obviously, I'm making a pitch and I'm trying to get him locked in. ... At the end of the day, it's Nate's decision \u2014 and I'll be happy for him either way.\"\n\n\"My pitch has been: 'You see what Kentucky has; they have legends, a crazy fan base, an amazing coach, an amazing coaching staff, awesome facilities,'\" Moreno said. \"'It's a great place to be.

They are completely uninhabited, with the last visit from people believed to be nearly 10 years ago.\n\nNevertheless, Heard and McDonald islands featured in a list released by the White House of \u201ccountries\u201d that would have new trade tariffs imposed.\n\nThe Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said on Thursday: \u201cNowhere on Earth is safe.\u201d\n\nHeard Island and McDonald Islands are among several \u201cexternal territories\u201d of Australia listed separately in the tariff list to Australia, which will see a 10% tariff imposed on its goods.\n\nExternal territories are part of Australia and not self-governing but have a unique relationship with the federal government. Such territories featured on the White House list were the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Norfolk Island.\n\nNorfolk Island, which has a population of 2,188 people and lies 1,600km (1,000 miles) north-east of Sydney, was slugged with a tariff of 29% \u2013 19 percentage points higher than the rest of Australia.\n\nIn 2023, Norfolk Island exported US$655,000 (A$1.04m) worth of goods to the US, with its main export being US$413,000 (A$658,000) worth of leather footwear, according to Observatory of Economic Complexity data.\n\nBut George Plant, the administrator of Norfolk Island, disputed the data. He told the Guardian: \u201cThere are no known exports from Norfolk Island to the United States and no tariffs or known non-tariff trade barriers on goods coming to Norfolk Island.\u201d\n\nAlbanese said on Thursday: \u201cNorfolk Island has got a 29% tariff. I\u2019m not quite sure that Norfolk Island, with respect to it, is a trade competitor with the giant economy of the United States, but that just shows and exemplifies the fact that nowhere on Earth is safe from this.\u201d\n\nThe export figures from Heard Island and McDonald Islands are even more perplexing. The territory does have a fishery but no buildings or human habitation whatsoever.\n\nDespite this, according to export data from the World Bank, the US imported US$1.4m (A$2.23m) of products from Heard Island and McDonald Islands in 2022, nearly all of which was \u201cmachinery and electrical\u201d imports. It was not immediately clear what those goods were.\n\nIn the five years prior, imports from Heard Island and McDonald Islands ranged from US$15,000 (A$24,000) to US$325,000 (A$518,000) per year.\n\nThe White House, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian Antarctic Division were contacted for comment.",

Police were called after a fellow patron, who was dining with his family, noticed they were unattended. The witness told police he saw Louis ordering food for the children around 4:30 p.m. and noted that Louis left the restaurant, came back and then left again.\n\nWhen Louis returned to McDonald\u2019s around 6:18 p.m., officers took him into custody, and he was later charged with deprivation of a minor. Louis told authorities that he had walked to the restaurant with his children from his apartment but didn\u2019t want to make them walk back while he was at a nearby job interview. He also stated that he did not own a car.\n\nWatch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE WATCH HERE\n\nAccording to a new police report filed on April 2, Louis's 10-year-old told an officer that her father frequently left them alone.\n\nAccording to the police report, the children were picked up by their mother and Louis was transported to Webster Detention Center.

And I will say: I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the flavor of this hot sauce. It is spicy, without being too overwhelming. Even now, several minutes after I finished my Nether Flame Sauce, my mouth is still pleasantly tingly with the lingering heat.\n\nI can\u2019t say I detected much of the promised \u201chints of garlic and sweetness,\u201d but I can also say I didn\u2019t necessarily miss them. In fact, if Nether Fire Sauce wasn\u2019t just a limited-time menu item themed to a Jason Momoa movie, I would absolutely get it again, and maybe even alternate it with Sweet \u2019N Sour in my nugget sauce rotation. For a condiment inspired by an infernal dimension, that feels like a solid win to me.\n\nGet our free mobile app",

The West extended the lead in the fourth quarter to as many as 15 points.\n\nThe game featured three players who have signed with Duke, led by brothers Cayden and Cameron Boozer, the sons of two-time NBA All-Star Carlos Boozer, who also was a Blue Devil. Cameron Boozer, ESPN's No. 3-ranked prospect for the 2025 class, shared MVP honors with Peterson, who is No. 2. Boozer led the East with 16 points. Isiah Harwell, a Houston commit ranked 13th by ESPN, also had 16 for the East.\n\nNikolas Khamenia also is headed to Duke and played on the West squad. UConn, winner of the past two national titles, had three McDonald's All Americans in this game for the first time. The trio all played for the West in guards Braylon Mullins and Darius Adams and center Eric Reibe.\n\nJoining Arenas on the West squad were the top two recruits in the country in forward A.J. Dybantsa, ESPN's No. 1-rated recruit who's committed to BYU, and Peterson, who's going to Kansas. Dybantsa finished off the West's first win in this game since 2018 with a big dunk inside the final minute and finished with 13 points. Washington signee Niko Bundalo added 12.\n\nDarius Acuff Jr., an Arkansas signee ranked fifth by ESPN, added 12 points for the East.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.",

Dybantsa\u2019s ability to score from all over the court is quite impressive, and he is incredibly effective in creating his own shot. There isn\u2019t a spot he can\u2019t score from, attacking strong at the dribble, getting to the rim and flourishing with his length, scoring off the catch, displaying hangtime and athleticism, and simply a nightmare matchup that will find him in the NBA sooner rather than later. I truly believe he can score whenever he wants.\n\nDarryn Peterson \u2013 Committed to Kansas\n\nAs I said two years ago, Peterson is simply different (Click Here). When watching him two years ago, I haven\u2019t seen many players that can simply score when they want, how they want, and do it time after time. When the ball is in his hands, he is instant offense and is a truly dangerous 3-level scorer with ease. Has tremendous range and comfort from the perimeter; he creates so well off the bounce and defenders can\u2019t stop him, and as a 6\u20196 athletic prospect, Peterson finishes tough at the rim. Going to Kansas, I believe he has a chance to lead the team in scoring and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he averages 15-20 points per game as a freshman next year.\n\nShon Abaev \u2013 Committed to Cincinnati\n\nI have become a big fan of this young man\u2019s game and can\u2019t wait to see what he brings at the next level. I do believe that he can come in and immediately make an impact for this program, being one of the go-to scorers, and he could be sneaking up on a few NBA Draft boards. I\u2019m telling you, his ability to score and knock down shots, getting to his spots with a quick release, has terrific range in his overall game, and his athleticism in scoring downhill are intriguing. He is one I would keep an eye on, especially as he gets stronger.\n\nCameron and Cayden Boozer \u2013 Committed to Duke\n\nThese two are going to come into Duke and be able to have an instant impact for the Blue Devils. Cameron, at 6\u20199, is such an impressive prospect with how fluid he operates, his comfort level from inside and out, and his ability to really dominate the glass. You can\u2019t help but be impressed with how well he moves, creating for himself off the bounce, showing tremendous IQ, and will be a force next season. Cayden was also impressive at the event. As a 6\u20194 guard, he plays with tremendous poise and has tremendous court awareness. He scores well off the bounce, takes what the defense gives him, and flourishes as a playmaker but has such a smooth scoring impact on the court.\n\nTounde Yessoufou \u2013 Committed to Baylor\n\nYessoufou is a 6\u20195, strong-framed prospect that already has a proven track record at the high school level. Watching him in this game, you can\u2019t help but fall in love with his energy and impact, playing hard on both sides of the court, getting the passing lanes, attacking out in transition, and scoring strong at the rim. He just seemed to be making plays in several areas of the court, and I believe that his motor, his scoring ability, and his physicality will be used well at Baylor.\n\nOther Notes:\n\nCaleb Wilson \u2013 Committed to North Carolina\n\nOne can see not only the impact he provides on both sides but also his potential. Great frame, is competitive, was active defensively, and has tremendous length at 6\u20199, along with mobility. He should be able to be used in a variety of ways at Chapel Hill.\n\nMeleek Thomas \u2013 Committed to Arkansas\n\nCan\u2019t wait to see what Calipari will be able to do with Thomas. Listed at 6\u20194 but is one that plays much bigger with his length. Instant offense, creates so well for himself and others, scores so well off the bounce, but also can pull up from all levels. Incredibly shifty and has a good change of speed, and he brings offense to the table whether it is scoring or facilitating.\n\nMikel Brown Jr. \u2013 Committed to Louisville\n\nBrown Jr. is simply electric with the ball in his hands. We know about his ability to knock down shots and his range, but Brown Jr. is so much fun when you watch him facilitating, creating off the bounce with his crossover, and really shining as a true point guard. His vision and passing is elite, and he should be able to bring that instantly to Louisville next season.\n\nChris Cenac Jr. \u2013 Committed to Houston\n\nHouston has themselves a good one coming, as he will be able to bring size at 6\u201910 but you can see that he is a very skilled big. Scored at the rim, good hands, and was active on the glass, Cenac should be a force inside but is also really opening eyes with his ability to stretch the court.",

Coach (Bob) Slater especially having confidence and trust in me my freshman year. All the other coaches \u2014 Coach Chris Mendes, Coach Andy Laurence and of course my dad, too. This all goes out to them.\"\n\nSlater couldn't have been happier for McDonald's achievement.\n\n\"He's been putting in the work since 6th grade,\" Slater said about McDonald. \"It paid off in a big way tonight and in a big game. It's definitely special and I think the world of him and his brother. He has a great family. He's a smart kid and I love it when kids who is in the top 10% of their class go out there and prove it on the hardwood.\"\n\nMcDonald is coming off a brilliant fall season where he led the Raiders football team to their second straight South Coast Conference Blue Division title. He scored an area-high touchdowns (26) and total points (162). McDonald also threw for eight touchdown passes.\n\nHerald News and Taunton Daily Gazette sports editor Steven Sanchez can be reached at ssanchez@heraldnews.com.

The only New Jersey resident named to the McDonald's All-American Games this year, the Morris County point guard was determined to \"put on a show\" for the local fans at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.\n\nMorris Catholic's starting point guard for the past four winters, Pauldo had little trouble picking up the same role for the East team on Tuesday night. She had nine points, seven assists and three rebounds.\n\nThe only promise Pauldo didn't deliver on was an East win. The West drove to a quick lead and polished off the East, 104-82, in the girls All-American game.\n\n\"This means everything to me,\" said Pauldo, the third McDonald's All-American from Paterson, following Tim Thomas (Paterson Catholic) and Essence Carson (Eastside).\n\n\"My Paterson people are coming to support me, because that's where I'm born and raised. Most people think I'm from Denville, New Jersey, because but that's just the high school I go to. My hood is Paterson, New Jersey, and that's where most of my support comes from.\"\n\nFirst family of Paterson basketball\n\nMia's paternal grandmother, Jeannette Wallace, 71, started the family's long history with basketball in Paterson.\n\nAfter finding no athletic options for girls while at Eastside High School except cheerleading or \"band auxiliary,\" Wallace was determined to make changes.\n\nAfter graduating from William Paterson with a health and physical education degree, she came home and started coaching midget league boys basketball. Wallace worked with Moe Leftwich, the Youth and Family Services Director for the Paterson YMCA, to launch the first girls basketball program in the city. Wallace proudly recalled how her son and daughter, D.J. Pauldo and Laina Wallace, \"sat on my bench watching me coach.\"\n\nCheck out the photo gallery, then scroll down for the rest of the story.\n\nD.J. and Filisha Latrell Pauldo are raising five kids in Paterson.\n\nThe eldest of the next generation, 23-year-old Daizon, also played basketball at Paterson Eastside \u2013 and in the family's backyard after D.J. ripped up the garage to put in a court. Mia and Mya are identical twins who turned 19 on Feb. 23, two days after the MCT final. Nyasia is 10 months younger. A senior at Panther Academy who plays for Eastside, she is currently sidelined after tearing her left ACL for the second time during preseason.\n\nMore: McDonald's All-American pick Mia Pauldo of Paterson serves up burgers in her hometown\n\nAfter getting started as tiny 6-year-olds playing alongside fourth graders, Mia and Mya Pauldo switched to an AAU team coached by their aunt and mom a couple of years later. They also tried gymnastics, softball, dance, karate, and modeling, among other activities.\n\n\"They just gravitated to basketball,\" said Jeannette Wallace, who worked as a teacher and then the first athletic counselor at Eastside for decades. \"Who knew they were going to be this good? They were this tall. But I knew they had it in them.\"\n\nD.J. Pauldo was working with high-level boys teams, including Daizon's. Filisha got her husband out to a tournament, and he realized what he had been missing.\n\n\"It was instantaneous,\" D.J. Pauldo said. \"From jump ball, (Mia) got the ball from somebody on the other team. she did some fancy dribble, kicked it up to Mya, and Mya made the layup. \u2026 I was in awe. I couldn't believe what I was watching.\"\n\nPauldo twins bound for Tennessee\n\nNot much changed as the twins got older.\n\nIt's difficult to differentiate between them on or off the court, to the point that both D.J. Pauldo and Morris Catholic head coach Rahim Huland El tend to refer to both in the same sentence.\n\nThe All-American Game was a rare time when the twins were not playing together. They share the Twin Back Court brand \u2013 and signed a Name, Image and Likeness deal with Puma before their sophomore seasons. Both also signed National Letters of Intent to go on to the University of Tennessee.\n\nMore: Morris Catholic's Mia Pauldo reaches 2,000 points in Morris County Tournament semifinal\n\nMia Pauldo averaged 19.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 3.3 steals as a senior, and was named Gatorade's New Jersey Player of the Year and the Morris County coaches' Player of the Year for the third straight year. The twins led Morris Catholic to four Morris County Tournament titles, three NJSIAA Non-Public trophies, and 57 straight games against New Jersey opponents.\n\n\"She has quickness and speed you don't often see in a young person. She has both,\" Huland El said. \"She really has an explosion into her shot you don't often see on the women's side. ... She's skilled and can score, but she understands what play should be made.\"",

            "content": "A funny thing happened on the way to being blown away by Audra McDonald in the new Broadway revival of \u201cGypsy.\u201d For much of the production, directed by George C. Wolfe, I was quibbling and quarreling with the reigning queen of Broadway.\n\nI expected to be agog, because whenever McDonald is on stage, no matter if it\u2019s a musical, play or concert, my appreciation for the majesty of her brilliance soars. But in \u201cGypsy,\u201d I felt strangely aloof from her performance for a good portion of the production. Heresy to admit it, but I questioned some of her choices and even doubted whether the role of Rose was an ideal fit for the Broadway performer I hold above all others.\n\nBut then something miraculous happened, \u201cRose\u2019s Turn,\u201d the show\u2019s shattering finale, and the path McDonald had been forging as Rose all along suddenly became transcendently clear. It wasn\u2019t simply that the actor\u2019s virtuosity was unleashed at full force. It was that Broadway history and Black American history were converging in a performer who was offering her gifts to an audience in a climactic conflagration.\n\nThe result was, if not a religious experience, then a spiritually transfiguring one. There was something at once sacrificial and redemptive in what McDonald was channeling in her art, and I left the Majestic Theatre feeling reborn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what was I caviling about to myself during intermission? Believe me, I\u2019m not in the habit of second-guessing this six-time Tony winner (a record for a performer, who has incredibly won in every acting category). Awe-struck is my accustomed state when McDonald is on stage.\n\nBut \u201cGypsy,\u201d the canonical 1959 musical by Jule Styne (music), Stephen Sondheim (lyrics) and Arthur Laurents (book), brings with it a raft of expectations.

My cognitive dissonance stemmed from theatrical considerations. I wondered about the suitability of McDonald\u2019s vocal style and questioned her comfort level with broad comedy.\n\nNow who in their right mind could have an issue with McDonald\u2019s singing?

When McDonald\u2019s Rose sings, on the other hand, you hear a classically trained singer with extraordinary vocal resources.\n\nAt moments her Rose sounds as if Carnegie Hall was her bygone dream for herself, not the vaudeville circuit. Styne and Sondheim\u2019s score is hardly a monolith.

Psychologically, it works. But the exceptional nature of McDonald\u2019s gifts strikes an incongruous note.\n\nThe beauty of McDonald\u2019s voice doesn\u2019t dissolve into the character but retains a kind of formality. You can hear this decorous quality in Rose\u2019s subsequent number with Herbie, \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Get Away From Me,\u201d as well as in the determinedly jaunty \u201cTogether, Wherever We Go,\u201d which brings Rose, Herbie and Joy Woods\u2019 Louise momentarily into frolicsome solidarity.\n\nThe sophisticated shadings of McDonald\u2019s singing are of a piece with the character\u2019s slightly affected manner of speech. I confess to having a little trouble placing this Rose. But what I worried might be a natural discrepancy between performer and role turned out to be an integral part of McDonald\u2019s character. It just took me some time to see how.\n\nWolfe leans into the revue-sketch nature of this backstage comedy. \u201cGypsy\u201d has been called the \u201cKing Lear\u201d of musicals for the capstone tyrannical parent role it provides an actor of a certain age. But the show\u2019s zany side has more in common with one of Shakespeare\u2019s early rollicking comedies \u2014 \u201cThe Taming of the Shrew\u201d en route to becoming \u201cKiss Me, Kate,\u201d perhaps.\n\nAudra McDonald in \u201cGypsy.\u201d (Julieta Cervantes)\n\nMcDonald is game for the high jinks but doesn\u2019t always seem natural gamboling about the stage. A slightly awkward cutup, she betrays some of the same resistance that Louise has shown when thrust against her will into yet another inane kiddie act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d that I realized \u2014 with the force of a crushing epiphany \u2014 that all of this was intentional. That it wasn\u2019t McDonald\u2019s mismatched qualities on display but the reality of a Black Rose who has had to adapt herself in constricted ways until better opportunities come her way.\n\nThe finale, a musical nervous breakdown, illuminates what\u2019s been driving the character all along. Here, it breaks the fa\u00e7ade that McDonald\u2019s Rose has had to erect to get through life. The careful enunciation, the singing voice that could soar to sublime heights but can\u2019t call too much attention to itself, the unwavering dreamer chasing after paltry show business leftovers \u2014 McDonald embodies the social reality of her character\u2019s compromised choices in the way she shrinks and swells Rose\u2019s very being.\n\nThe anguish that erupts during this \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d represents more than the built-up sorrow of one embittered woman. It holds the grief of ancestors denied their shot. McDonald\u2019s performance opens a window onto the grandmothers and great-grandmothers whose lives were even more tragically curtailed.\n\nNever have I experienced a performance come into such searing retroactive focus. The catharsis of \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d is also a fulfillment. In \u201cGypsy,\u201d McDonald augments her unparalleled Broadway legacy by summoning America\u2019s rueful history to the stage.",

            "content": "The other day, Kevin McDonald, the curly-haired actor-comedian best known as one of the Kids in the Hall, the beloved Canadian comedy troupe, invited a few people to a rehearsal in a tiny hotel room in lower Manhattan. One guest\u2019s knock had a rhythm similar to \u201cshave and a haircut.\u201d McDonald knocked back \u201ctwo bits,\u201d then opened the door. \u201cI had to do the callback,\u201d he said, looking pleased. \u201cAnd I did shave today.\u201d McDonald, who lives in Winnipeg, was in town to perform his rock opera in progress, \u201cKevin McDonald Superstar,\u201d at the SoHo Playhouse, with friends like his fellow-comedians Dave Hill and Janeane Garofalo. McDonald\u2019s curls are now gray, and he was wiry and energetic in an oversized hoodie. The hotel room was angular and spare\u2014one bed, one chair, two bananas\u2014and it overlooked an H.V.A.C. system. \u201cI opened the curtains so we could see the view,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cI\u2019ll close them when I\u2019m alone later, crying.\u201d Two young collaborators, John Wlaysewski and Aaron Tarnow, sat on the bed, with librettos. Wlaysewski, the show\u2019s music director, held an acoustic guitar. \u201cI\u2019ll be Joan Rivers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cKevin McDonald Superstar,\u201d with music and lyrics by McDonald, centers on a few days of youthful idiocy in 1991\u2014when the \u201cKids in the Hall\u201d series was on HBO\u2014during which he and his fellow-Kid Dave Foley travelled from Toronto to New York to appear on Joan Rivers\u2019s talk show. The night before the taping, in an effort to whoop it up in New York, the pair attended a gala charity event\u2014an AIDS benefit, featuring the band Deee-Lite. Drunken mayhem and bad decisions, some atop a buffet table, ensued. \u201cKevin McDonald Superstar,\u201d like one of its inspirations, \u201cJesus Christ Superstar,\u201d has themes of fame, doubt, betrayal, and alcohol. Wlaysewski began strumming a plaintive ballad with an air of foreboding. \u201cKevin, do you want to start out being Lorne Michaels?\u201d Tarnow asked. (Michaels produced \u201cThe Kids in the Hall.\u201d)\n\n\u201cYou know, the thing about this is, I\u2019ll kill them,\u201d McDonald said, in a Lorne voice. As himself, he sang, \u201cJoan Rivers says . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we talk? Can we talk?\u201d Wlaysewski said.\n\n\u201cDave and Kevin say,\u201d McDonald sang.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014\u2019cuz we\u2019re drunk,\u201d McDonald and Tarnow sang. They sang of on-camera mumbling, dehydration, and wooziness; the last line was \u201cGet them off my set!\u201d Other numbers were more rollicking; McDonald danced in a style that suggested a frenetic hybrid of the frug and the mashed potato. \u201cI cheated on you / with a Howard Stern fan / at an AIDS benefit,\u201d he sang. On \u201cI will never cheat, never cheat again / Except on taxes / But only if it\u2019s done quasi-legally,\u201d he hit an operatic series of notes, almost like yodelling. Tarnow looked up, wide-eyed. \u201cWow,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to make it like Frank Sinatra, phrasing when I want,\u201d McDonald said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing I thought of\u2014Ol\u2019 Blue Eyes,\u201d Wlaysewski said. Then another knock at the door: the comedian Frank Conniff, who\u2019d be playing Dave Foley. \u201cI can\u2019t sing, but I sang a lot on \u2018Mystery Science Theater,\u2019 \u201d he said. Wlaysewski reassured him: \u201cI play defensive guitar.\u201d They began. \u201cWhy are those silly heteros / Fucking up this AIDS benefit?\u201d everyone sang.\n\nAfter rehearsal, the gang went to Harney & Sons for a vocals-friendly round of tea. McDonald jostled, and apologized to, a \u201cHAVE A TEA-RRIFFIC DAY!\u201d sign, then sat at a table and recalled his musical journey. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a knack for melody,\u201d he said. As a kid, in Toronto, \u201cI\u2019d hum songs and write lyrics I thought were witty. I\u2019d sing them to my mother as she was washing the dishes.\u201d Artistic revelations came early. First, the Beatles; second, \u201cKing Kong\u201d (\u201cI thought, Wow! Movies could be that good?\u201d); and third, in Catholic school, \u201cJesus Christ Superstar,\u201d which blew his mind. \u201cThe relationship between Jesus and Judas\u2014ambiguous!\u201d he recalled. \u201cThat was the key thing in the seventies. I went to Sam the Record Man and bought the movie soundtrack. I tried to write it all down, like I\u2019d done with \u2018Young Frankenstein.\u2019 It made me love rock opera.\u201d Kids in the Hall, which he formed with Foley, Bruce McCulloch, Scott Thompson, and Mark McKinney, in 1984, had a punk comedy sensibility\u2014and punk is part of what later bonded him with Dave Hill, who would open that week\u2019s shows and play multiple roles. They met at Sketchfest in San Francisco, in 2023, duetting on \u201cInstitutionalized,\u201d the Suicidal Tendencies song from \u201cRepo Man.\u201d \u201cI had a comedy crush on him,\u201d McDonald said. It intensified a year later, when Hill caused a punkish ruckus at a hockey game in Anaheim. \u201cI was watching, because the Leafs were playing,\u201d McDonald said. In an electric-guitar performance that circulated online, Hill played both the U.S. and Canadian national anthems Hendrix style, with shredding. McDonald laughed. \u201cYou see the players on the ice\u2014they\u2019re like this.\u201d He made an \u201cagog\u201d face. \u201cThey were like the guys at the AIDS benefit.\u201d \u2666",

But in \u201cGypsy,\u201d I felt strangely aloof from her performance for a good portion of the production. Heresy to admit it, but I questioned some of her choices and even doubted whether the role of Rose was an ideal fit for the Broadway performer I hold above all others.\n\nBut then something miraculous happened, \u201cRose\u2019s Turn,\u201d the show\u2019s shattering finale, and the path McDonald had been forging as Rose all along suddenly became transcendently clear. It wasn\u2019t simply that the actor\u2019s virtuosity was unleashed at full force. It was that Broadway history and Black American history were converging in a performer who was offering her gifts to an audience in a climactic conflagration.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result was, if not a religious experience, then a spiritually transfiguring one. There was something at once sacrificial and redemptive in what McDonald was channeling in her art, and I left the Majestic Theatre feeling reborn.\n\nSo what was I caviling about to myself during intermission? Believe me, I\u2019m not in the habit of second-guessing this six-time Tony winner (a record for a performer, who has incredibly won in every acting category). Awe-struck is my accustomed state when McDonald is on stage.\n\nBut \u201cGypsy,\u201d the canonical 1959 musical by Jule Styne (music), Stephen Sondheim (lyrics) and Arthur Laurents (book), brings with it a raft of expectations.

That it wasn\u2019t McDonald\u2019s mismatched qualities on display but the reality of a Black Rose who has had to adapt herself in constricted ways until better opportunities come her way.\n\nThe finale, a musical nervous breakdown, illuminates what\u2019s been driving the character all along. Here, it breaks the fa\u00e7ade that McDonald\u2019s Rose has had to erect to get through life. The careful enunciation, the singing voice that could soar to sublime heights but can\u2019t call too much attention to itself, the unwavering dreamer chasing after paltry show business leftovers \u2014 McDonald embodies the social reality of her character's compromised choices in the way she shrinks and swells Rose's very being.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anguish that erupts during this \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d represents more than the built-up sorrow of one embittered woman. It holds the grief of ancestors denied their shot. McDonald\u2019s performance opens a window onto the grandmothers and great-grandmothers whose lives were even more tragically curtailed.\n\nNever have I experienced a performance come into such searing retroactive focus. The catharsis of \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d is also a fulfillment. In \"Gypsy,\" McDonald augments her unparalleled Broadway legacy by summoning America\u2019s rueful history to the stage.\n\nGet notified when the biggest stories in Hollywood, culture and entertainment go live.

Lana Bellamy/Times Union\n\nGOSHEN \u2014 Prosecutors made the first significant connection between Edward Holley and Megan McDonald\u2019s murder last week \u2014 a signal their case is turning to Holley\u2019s alleged involvement in her death as the trial approaches the one-month mark.\n\nSince opening arguments, jurors have heard about a purplish Honda Civic hatchback allegedly spotted with McDonald\u2019s white Mercury Sable in the predawn hours of March 14, 2003. That night, the 20-year-old was choked and beaten to death.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nMcDonald\u2019s car was found two days later at Kensington Manor, an apartment complex four minutes from a party where her friends saw her for the last time and less than 500 feet from where Holley lived. Dawn Gasca Young, a resident of Kensington Manor, told police on March 17 that she saw McDonald\u2019s car and a dark-colored car with loud music circling the complex shortly before McDonald\u2019s vehicle was abandoned. Seventeen years later, Young gave investigators more details, describing the dark-colored car as a purple Honda Civic hatchback driven by a man wearing a baseball cap. Young testified that she also adjusted the timeframe for when she saw the cars, from after midnight March 15 to after midnight March 14.\n\nUntil last week, it had been unclear if Holley had access to the type of vehicle Young described. Some of McDonald\u2019s friends had testified that she helped Holley buy such a car. A longtime mutual friend of McDonald\u2019s and Holley\u2019s testified that he couldn\u2019t remember Holley driving a car like that.\n\nBut prosecutors strengthened the connection with testimony Wednesday from state Department of Motor Vehicles Investigator Stephen Lacelle, Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office Investigator Kelsey Ragni and Jason Kinney, the former owner of a purplish 1990 Honda Civic hatchback that may be the vehicle in question.\n\nThe Murder of Megan McDonald newsletter Stay up to date with the latest updates in the 2003 case and the trial of Edward V. Holley. Sign up here.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nKinney could not recall the name of the man he sold it to in 2002. But Ragni explained how she searched databases to determine that Holley\u2019s mother, Nadine C. Rivers, owned Kinney\u2019s former car in 2003. Ragni also found that Rivers sold the car in April 2003, a month after McDonald\u2019s murder.\n\nOn Thursday, State Police Investigator Kevin Chorzempa testified that in June 2008, Holley told police McDonald helped him buy a Honda Civic. Holley also said in that interview he sometimes drove McDonald\u2019s car or caught rides with her in the winter because his car had broken down, according to Chorzempa\u2019s testimony.\n\nBut it was Holley\u2019s own words that put the matter to bed on Friday. That morning, jurors heard Holley tell State Police Investigator Brad Natalizio in a recorded 2019 interview that McDonald had helped him buy a purple Honda Civic hatchback registered to Rivers. The four-hour interview was played in full for the jurors like during the pretrial hearing Judge Hyun Chin Kim used to assess whether Holley spoke to the police without coercion.\n\nIn this screenshot from an interview with State Police in 2019 at the Troop F headquarters, Edward Holley, left, speaks with State Police investigators Samantha Gau, right, and Brad Natalizio, center, about Megan McDonald's murder. The four-hour video was played in full during a pretrial hearing last year and again for jurors during Holley's trial for McDonald's murder. Screen capture from video of State Police interview\n\nEstablishing Holley\u2019s connection to the vehicle potentially shows the prosecution\u2019s case against him coming together. Until now, Holley, who is charged with second-degree murder for killing McDonald, was hardly mentioned as co-special prosecutors Julia Cornachio and Laura Murphy laid the foundation of McDonald\u2019s story.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nSimpson, who dated McDonald before Holley, had a rocky relationship with her. He testified they would sometimes hit each other. Simpson said he dealt crack cocaine in the Middletown area back in 2003. His DNA was found on a cigar blunt found in McDonald\u2019s car. Simpson gave jurors his alibi, which was backed by testimony from his former girlfriend and her sister, Amber Nunes, who described herself as Simpson\u2019s best friend.\n\nHolley didn\u2019t become a suspect until much later in the decades-long investigation. Testimony from police last week suggested they sometimes relied on gut instincts rather than physical evidence as they moved through the case, eliminating suspects while honing in on others.\n\n\u2018Your gut solved the case?\u2019\n\nJohn Ramos, State Police\u2019s first lead investigator for McDonald\u2019s murder, took the stand after Pauly Simpson.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nRamos explained his early approach to the probe. He took DNA samples from several people associated with McDonald, Simpson and Simpson\u2019s friend group. His investigation into Simpson\u2019s alibi included interviewing the cab driver who took him to his girlfriend\u2019s house that night and searching her home.\n\nSimpson participated in a lengthy interview with police two days after McDonald\u2019s death. Prosecutors displayed photos police took of Simpson\u2019s body, which showed redness covering his hands past his wrists. Ramos said Simpson attributed the discoloration to a skin condition. The police did not seek medical proof.\n\n\u201cHe told us,\u201d Ramos said when one of Holley\u2019s lawyers, Eli Siems, asked during cross-examination how he knew Simpson was telling the truth.\n\n\u201cAnd that was enough?\u201d Siems said.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cIt was for me \u2014 and the investigators in the room,\u201d Ramos said.\n\nPolice also initially investigated a black Dodge Neon owned by a girlfriend of Simpson\u2019s friend, Aaron Brown. Ramos said Brown\u2019s girlfriend told police she had the car overnight on March 15, 2003. Part of why police determined the car had not been involved in the murder was because of Dawn Gasca Young\u2019s 2003 testimony \u2014 before she changed her timeframe. During cross-examination, Ramos said Brown\u2019s girlfriend told police Brown had the car on the night of March 14.\n\nOn Thursday, Chorzempa testified to how his intuition similarly guided him in a 2008 interview with Holley. At that time, Chorzempa was a \u201cbackroom\u201d investigator for State Police\u2019s Troop F. The McDonald murder case had a new lead detective who had instructed investigators to reinterview everyone police had previously spoken to and search for new connections.\n\nHolley, who was not a suspect then, hadn\u2019t spoken to police about the case since giving a statement to Investigator Michael Dewitt two days after McDonald\u2019s murder.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nSince Chorzempa wasn\u2019t familiar with the case, his partner, Investigator Vincent Delango, led the interview with Holley at his Highland Falls home. Holley willingly gave them a DNA sample and continued his interview at Troop F headquarters.\n\nChorzempa testified that inconsistencies between Holley\u2019s 2003 statement and what he said in 2008 stood out, but Holley\u2019s shifting demeanor particularly interested him. Chorzempa said Holley spoke softly with his hands in his lap and eyes downcast when he relayed a story of Simpson and Simpson\u2019s friend attacking McDonald.\n\nHolley said, \u201cThey kept hitting her, and hitting her, and hitting her,\u201d Chorzempa recalled. Holley said he heard Simpson and his friend had driven around with McDonald\u2019s body before leaving her on Bowser Road.\n\nChorzempa testified that he believed Holley\u2019s behavior indicated he was picturing himself killing her.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nLater, around 2017, Investigator Natalizio called Chorzempa to ask his opinion on a case. Natalizio didn\u2019t say he was calling about the McDonald murder, but Chorzempa immediately told him, \u201cEd Holley did it,\u201d according to Chorzempa\u2019s testimony.\n\nSiems asked Chorzempa if he felt qualified to give an opinion on a complex case he was unfamiliar with. Chorzempa said he was, based on his experience interviewing thousands of people.\n\n\u201cYour gut solved the case?\u201d Siems asked, voice raised.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Chorzempa said.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nAndre Thurston\u2019s brother testified\n\nOther notable testimony over the past week came from Eric Thurston, the brother of Andre Thurston, who died in 2010. Thurston\u2019s DNA was found in multiple places in McDonald\u2019s car after she was murdered. He is also widely known to have been a person of interest in the case and was a client of David Hoovler before Hoovler was elected Orange County district attorney.\n\nHoovler\u2019s representation of Thurston has been a source of drama for the case outside the courtroom. It prompted the district attorney to recuse himself from the case six days after Holley\u2019s arrest in April 2023, revealing a rift between law enforcement and the Orange County District Attorney\u2019s Office that may feature in Holley\u2019s trial in its final stretch.\n\nEric Thurston, the prosecution\u2019s 30th witness, took the stand Tuesday afternoon. He currently works as a peace officer and youth division agent for the state Office of Child and Family Services.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIn March 2003, Thurston was living with his mother and Andre. He said Andre never really worked, preferring to play video games and work on his car. Eric met McDonald through her friend, whom he dated back then. McDonald was also friends with Andre. Eric considered himself \u201cpretty close\u201d with McDonald and said she had called their house phone the day before she died, looking for Andre.\n\nEric told prosecutors he always cooperated with investigators because \u201cwhoever is responsible for this needs to be brought to justice.\u201d During cross-examination, Thurston confirmed to Holley\u2019s lawyers he had a longstanding professional relationship with Natalizio and that the police had paid him for his cooperation in the past. At one point, Eric testified that he had escorted police to different places of interest in the investigation.\n\nEric said the State Police didn\u2019t force him to speak to anyone and stressed that he never asked for compensation. Holley\u2019s lawyer, Paul Weber, noted, \u201cYou didn\u2019t give the money back.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nAny time police contacted him, \u201cI was always there to help out,\u201d Eric said.",

The BYU commit is one of the best finishers in the country with elite speed, a seven-foot wingspan and NBA-level vertical bounce to go along with lateral quickness. Against a set defense, he loves to rise up and shoot from the midrange or beyond the arc. Expect him to use his energy and scoring prowess to try to take over.\n\nOn the other side, Boozer is polished and poised. The Duke commit plays with focus and intensity, and the game has slowed down for him. At 6-foot-9, he plays the role of the point forward with impressive vision and feel while looking to gobble up every rebound. His passing is one of his greatest skills.\n\nWhat we're watching: Although they play different positions -- Dybantsa is a small forward, Boozer a power forward -- expect to see them matched up at times. Can Boozer, who is roughly 45 pounds heavier than Dybantsa, defend him away from the basket? Can Dybantsa hit the glass and hold his ground in the post against Boozer?\n\nWe'll also be watching for the player who will take matters into his own hands to land his team a win, especially considering both have more to prove after this event -- Boozer in the Chipotle Nationals, Dybantsa in the Hoop Summit. NBA executives will be locked in when these two are on the court.\n\nWhat they bring to the game: Both are dynamic, score-first guards who will command high usage rates, despite contrasting offensive styles. Acuff plays with force and will fit well next season with Arkansas head coach John Calipari, whereas Brown (a Louisville commit) plays with more skill. Both excel as point guards who can maneuver the pick-and-roll, push the tempo and make impressive passes in transition.\n\nWhat we're watching: Brown will be challenged to keep the stronger Acuff out of the lane and stay in front of the ball. Acuff will need to prove he can stay close enough to Brown to take away his deep 3-point shot, while also still anticipating his drive. This battle could come down to who facilitates more offense for their team and racks up more assists.\n\n2025 West Roster ESPN 100\n\nrank Pos. High school Committed to Alijah Arenas 12 G Chatsworth High School (CA) USC Mikel Brown Jr. 8 G DME Academy (FL) Louisville Nikola Bundalo 28 F Prolific Prep (CA) Washington Brayden Burries 11 G Eleanor Roosevelt High School (CA) Undecided Chris Cenac Jr. 6 C Link Academy (MO) Houston AJ Dybantsa 1 F Utah Prep Academy (UT) BYU Nikolas Khamenia 21 F Harvard-Westlake School (CA) Duke Koa Peat 9 F Perry High School (AZ) Arizona Darryn Peterson 2 G Prolific Prep (CA) Kansas Meleek Thomas 10 G Overtime Elite Academy (GA) Arkansas Caleb Wilson 7 F Holy Innocents' Episcopal School (GA) North Carolina Tounde Yessoufou 15 F St. Joseph High School (CA) Baylor\n\nWhat they bring to the game: This is a sneaky great matchup between two high-upside wings with terrific positional size and length. Ament is close to 6-10 with a soft shooting touch. He also has the footwork to create space and drive by defenders. He is currently the top unsigned senior, can score at all three levels and flashes shades of Michael Porter Jr. at the same stage.\n\nArenas was formerly a top-10 prospect in the 2026 class before reclassifying. Now committed to USC, his quick bounce at the rim and straight-line speed in the open court are impressive. He is gritty enough to score in tight spaces, which is a luxury at the next level.\n\nWhat we're watching: Ament needs to finish through contact at the rim more consistently. Will Arenas' 6-6 frame and aggressiveness slow him down? If not, Ament will bury multiple 3-pointers when left open. Ament for his part will need to stay locked in defensively to avoid ceding ground or losing track of Arenas. He is expected to announce his college decision soon.\n\nWhat they bring to the game: This is the battle of the bigs. Without question, Cenac is one of the most talented players in the class and one of two Houston commits on this list. The 6-10 center was very productive and showed great upside, fluidity, touch and athleticism down the stretch of his high school career.\n\nReibe is a skilled lefty with a true inside-out presence. He scores via jump hooks, face-up jumpers and passes well from the high post. He has the range to knock down jumpers from beyond the arc, and at 6-11 rebounds and protects the rim at a high level. The UConn commit is reminiscent of former Huskies big man Donovan Clingan.\n\nWhat we're watching: Can Cenac outmaneuver Reibe's size and strength in the paint? Can Reibe handle Cenac's ability to sprint the floor as a rim runner, or defend him in space in pick-and-pop actions? This is a perfect opportunity to see which big man will prevail in the paint; Cenac must prove that his low-post defense, face-up game, verticality and defensive quickness are all up for the challenge. The NBA will be watching both players closely.\n\nNo. 2 Darryn Peterson vs. No. 13 Isiah Harwell\n\nWhat they bring to the game: The Big 12 has the most incoming five-star talent of any conference next season. Peterson, a Kansas commit, had one of the best senior seasons in the country. At 6-6, he's a pure shooting guard who's learning to run the point. He understands how to change speeds, gets to his spots at will and can knock down 3s if defenders back off. He also finds open pockets of space and operates ball screens like a veteran.\n\nHouston commit Harwell counters with a rugged 6-6, 210-pound frame as a scoring guard who also prides himself on the defensive end. In addition to having a powerful build, he's also an excellent shotmaker.\n\nWhat we're watching: Peterson is a legitimate MVP contender in this game and will have the ball in his hands often. Can Harwell's defensive acumen and physicality slow him down? Harwell is one of the few players who can contain Peterson and score on him on the other end. If not, Peterson has the takeover ability, aggressiveness and college-ready frame to dominate the line.\n\nIt'll be fascinating to see how Peterson handles Harwell, who has the size to back him down into the midpost with his dribble, if he gets hot. Both players play a team game, so this matchup will see two versatile, big guards going head-to-head.",

It's all thanks to a doctor at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\"The Ronald McDonald House is a Philadelphia first and Pennsylvania first,\" said Susan Campbell, CEO of Ronald McDonald House Philadelphia.\n\nSEE ALSO: Lehigh Valley plant produces 5.5 million PEEPS a day | Made in PA\n\nThe space was right on Spruce Street in West Philadelphia.\n\nThe idea to support sick children and their families getting critical care in Philadelphia was the brainchild of Dr. Audrey Evans, an oncologist at CHOP.\n\n\"(She) saw parents sleeping on the floor in their child's hospital room with no place to stay, and the financial devastation of traveling to Philadelphia for oncology treatment and how to manage that,\" said Campbell. \"She had a vision that she needed a house nearby where families could stay.\"\n\nAt the same time, Fred Hill, tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles, had a daughter diagnosed with leukemia.\n\nThe Eagles began fundraising around the Hills, but the family and team wanted to do more and partnered with Dr. Evans.\n\n\"Audrey Evans came to the Philadelphia Eagles. Jimmy Murray was the GM at the time, and he said, 'What if we worked with McDonald's and sold Shamrock Shakes and use that money to build a house where families can stay when they have kids with cancer?'\" explained Julie Hirshey, VP of Community Relations for the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nMade in Pa. | Zippo produces millions of lighters every year right here in Pennsylvania\n\n\"They approached their advertising partners, McDonald's, whether they would consider giving locally a quarter of every shake sold,\" added Campbell. \"McDonald's came back and said, 'We would give you all of it if you call it the Ronald McDonald House.'\"\n\n\"In the early 80s, we moved to this location. We went from seven bedrooms to 20, and then from 20 to 45, and six years ago we expanded on this location and we are now at 127 rooms,\" said Campbell.\n\nThe flagship house, now on Chestnut Street, is equipped with play areas, also offering tutoring for kids and their siblings, and transportation to the hospital.\n\nPlus, a special perk from its founders: frequent visits from the Eagles.\n\n\"We go over there and do game nights with the kids, we recognize they have wonderful spaces over there where kids are going to get to play, so we have an Eagles-branded space. To have the team a part of that... and really I think it's the spirit of the Eagles then and today,\" said Hirshey\n\nDr. Evans and the Eagles set the model for the early Ronald McDonald Houses to open in other major cities.\n\nTheir mission has now expanded across the globe to nearly 400 homes.\n\n\"It's a badge of honor. It's always great to take a moment to say it all started right there,\" said Campbell.",

Customers, staff and shareholders are entitled to ask: can I get extra security with that?\n\nWith almost 43,500 restaurants and about 70 million daily customers, McDonald\u2019s certainly meets the use case criteria for big AI investment. Its 175 million \u2018loyalty users\u2019 give it oceans of data about preferences and spending, and its kitchens contain expensive kit packed with hard-working components that are well worth tracking.\n\nIt makes good business sense to apply the latest technology to process, catalog and analyze that data for pain points and potential improvements. For McDonald\u2019s, the priority will be to ensure the AI investment doesn\u2019t itself become a major pain point.\n\nThe chain seems to recognize the risks. In its corporate filings, it notes that \u201cthe artificial intelligence tools we are incorporating into certain aspects of our business may not generate the intended efficiencies and may impact our business results.\u201d Its long list of potential IT risks now includes \u201cdeepfakes and other malicious uses of artificial intelligence\u201d alongside traditional cyber threats.\n\nA key challenge for McDonald\u2019s and other quick service restaurants is that there are simply so many interfaces with customers, from counter and onscreen ordering in-store to drive-through terminals, in-app purchasing, and third-party food ordering and delivery services.\n\nIntroducing any new technology at any of those interfaces opens up fresh attack surfaces for threat actors. With AI, the risks are magnified: this is new technology, the threat surface is nascent, and infosec professionals don\u2019t have the tools or knowledge to discover or defend against every threat.\n\nWe know that threat actors target their efforts at accessible assets, things people interact with such as websites, mobile apps and public-facing servers. A little-used network point that is accidentally left live can be exploited to access critical systems. Multiply those examples out across the Golden Arches, with all its screens and drive-through terminals, and you begin to see the scale of the security challenge.\n\nVoice recognition and computer vision systems throw up all sorts of concerns, both in terms of security and privacy. Alongside accidental and malicious threats, McDonald\u2019s must consider environmental aspects: its drive-throughs are surrounded by continuous and dynamic sounds that can confuse an AI system or give a low quality of service. What works in one location may not work in another.\n\nMeanwhile, experience teaches us that humans tend to utilize any loopholes they can find, potentially triggering the type of losses that McDonald\u2019s fears in its corporate filings. AI systems, with all their component parts, complicate the picture even further: as AI is increasingly connected to both virtual and physical entities, via agents, assets that were previously beyond reach may become accessible.\n\nAn agentic AI \u2018virtual manager\u2019 is an appealing prospect for enterprises but will need access to staff information and HR systems to compile rotas, for example. If that access is not adequately protected, it could be a target for attack and manipulation. Meanwhile, splitting responsibility between human and digital systems can result in gaps in and the creation of new threats, even by accident.\n\nIn this fast-paced environment, it\u2019s obvious that enterprises must be certain their AI systems are subject to rigorous testing, both pre-launch and on an ongoing basis. At the moment, however, testing of AI models is still largely human-centric, even at the biggest and best-known AI companies.\n\nThat\u2019s an issue because manual red-teaming exercises can span weeks or even months, resulting in a stale and incomplete understanding of current risks. In a world where each AI system \u2014 and the agents within it \u2014 can be uniquely equipped and tasked, the permutations involved in how the system operates explode in scale. So too do the attack options for bad actors, who have time on their side.\n\nThreat actors can afford to invest time in probing widely and deeply for weaknesses but time equals money for enterprises. Their sweet spot is to find the most effective security solution by red-teaming in the quickest time possible, in order to get an effective perimeter around their IT assets.\n\nPreparing for AI systems to fail is just as important as preparing for them to succeed but the task of trying to find all the permutations in an agentic system is incomprehensibly difficult and time-consuming for human testers. With the make-up of AI agents constantly changing, even a highly-skilled specialist with lots of existing software tools can never hope to keep up.\n\nThe solution is Agentic Warfare, or using customizable AI agents to simulate real-world adversarial interactions and automate red-teaming of AI systems for weaknesses and flaws. It applies brute-force permutation attack abilities, with a layer of intelligence built in, eliminating the mismatch that exists between the promise of agentic AI and the limitations of manual red-teaming.\n\nAgentic Warfare meets the challenge of keeping up with the latest model releases and addresses the reality that what\u2019s safe today will not be safe tomorrow. It also turns on its head the misconception that AI security is a bottleneck; by providing the ability to quickly find flaws in AI systems, the entire system is inherently safer and the rate of iteration is expedited.\n\nIn continuous testing, flaws have been found in all the world\u2019s leading foundation models and have been ranked on a leaderboard. As enterprises such as McDonald\u2019s rush to deploy new systems built upon these models, understanding the relationship between performance, cost, and security has never been more critical.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is seen as a leader in technology adoption; where it goes, others in its industry often follow. A super-sized approach to AI security at this stage should likewise set the standard for its sector. Otherwise, it risks making a meal of its AI ambitions.",

Authorities were called after a concerned customer noticed the children, ages 1, 6, and 10, were left alone.\n\nThis file photo shows the playground inside the McDonald\u2019s restaurant where three children were found unattended.\n\nA responding deputy found the children unattended. A witness reported seeing Louis with the children around 4:30 p.m. that day. The witness also observed Louis leave the restaurant, return later before leaving again.\n\nLouis arrived back at McDonald\u2019s around 6:18 p.m. and was detained by officers.

Most plastic is made from dirty fuels like oil and gas that release heat-trapping pollution into the air.\n\nSwapping to paper-based alternatives helps cut back that pollution and keeps toxic microplastics out of our bodies and waterways.\n\nOther major brands are following suit. Battery maker Better Battery Co. became the first company to go fully plastic-free across its entire product lineup.\n\nIts batteries, now sold at retailers like Target and Walmart, come in recyclable, FSC-certified boxes and even include a prepaid envelope so customers can easily return used batteries for recycling.\n\nIt's a hassle-free way for shoppers to reduce waste and make smarter choices without paying more.\n\nLuxury whisky brand Bruichladdich is making a similar shift. As part of its \"One Tin Lighter\" initiative, the company teamed up with papermaker James Cropper to replace its traditional tin canisters with recyclable, molded fiber wraps.\n\nThe new glue-free design features a sleek clasp and elegant embossing, delivering a premium look with a lighter footprint.\n\nThis trend is part of a larger wave of companies opting for plastic-free packaging to meet consumer demand and reduce dirty fuel pollution.\n\nMajor brands like Seventh Generation and Unilever have also made similar packaging commitments to help curb plastic waste and protect communities from harmful pollution.\n\nYou can support this shift by choosing brands that prioritize eco-friendly initiatives; even something as simple as checking a company's website for its green efforts before you shop makes a difference.\n\nOlli Johansson, McDonald's Finland CEO, commented the following, according to Yahoo Finance: \"McDonald's goal is for all packaging to come from renewable, recycled, and certified materials before the end of 2025.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

While the fast-food goliath is dealing with inflation headwinds and shifts in consumer spending, it recently celebrated all-time record revenues and earnings. Even as the stock hovers near its 52-week highs, I think it remains reasonably valued, given the company\u2019s proven strength, overall outlook, and unique qualities.\n\nDon't Miss Our End of Quarter Offers:\n\nDiscover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks.\n\nMake smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter.\n\nGiven the confluence of factors underpinning MCD stock combined with sustained bullish momentum over the past five years, I\u2019m bullish on the stock.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) price history over the past 3 years\n\nNavigating Economic and Industry Headwinds\n\nMcDonald\u2019s faced a challenging environment last year, contending with macro and industry-specific setbacks. Notably, inflation and tighter household budgets squeezed consumer spending, especially among low-income families. In a public statement, McDonald\u2019s management noted they were \u201cstruggling to get low-income consumers back into stores despite expanding discounts\u201d following a revenue slump. Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, one of McDonald\u2019s most significant international markets, customer traffic weakened, with management acknowledging that Britain was among its most \u201cchallenged\u201d regions as lower-income Brits were switching to other fast food alternatives.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) vs. S&P 500 (SPY)\n\nAdding to these pressures was an E. coli outbreak in the U.S. that hit the chain in the fall of 2024, linked to contaminated toppings on its quarter-pounder burgers. McDonald\u2019s swiftly removed the contaminated ingredients and reassured customers, but the incident dented late-year sales, as U.S. comparable sales fell 1.4% in Q4. For investors, this is rather worrying because this decline marked the steepest drop since the pandemic, as many customers avoided McDonald\u2019s products during the scare.\n\nResilience Keeps Delivering Record Results\n\nAnd yet, even in the face of these headwinds, McDonald\u2019s managed to keep the ship steady through the storm. The company celebrated record-high sales and EPS for 2024. System-wide sales reached $26 billion, a modest 2% rise that nevertheless marked an all-time high, while EPS climbed 8.2% to a record $12.33.\n\nA major driver was the momentum of its loyalty program and digital platform. Indeed, McDonald\u2019s reported about $30 billion in systemwide sales from loyalty members for the year, an uptick of 30%. By year-end, it had over 175 million active rewards users globally, up 15%, which goes to show how its mobile app and rewards deepen customer engagement\u200b.",

Sign up to Seanchas, our history and culture newsletter\n\nMcDonald's is undoubtedly one of the most popular fast-food options in the world, and while the industry first started out promising quick, hot and cheap food, standards have understandably dropped as demand increases.\n\nTucking in to your Big Mac, cheeseburger or whatever golden arches delicacy it is which picks your fancy and finding it to be luke warm or even cold can be heart-breaking. Leaving leftovers of fast-food, which isn't usually that common, is another scenario where you're left scratching your brain on how to turn some cold grub into something tasty.\n\nNow, the best way to reheat your fast-food extras, such as the popular McDonald's burgers, has been revealed thanks to multiple test and trials involving the Bacon McDouble.\n\n(Image: NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nThe best way to get warm up the burger to a good standard is to wrap it in either a paper towel or parchment paper - similar to how is left in the restaurant - before microwaving it 30 seconds, according to the Daily Meal.\n\nDiverting from how staff at the popular fast-food chain usually operate, it was recommended that no vegetable toppings - such as lettuce and pickles - are put in the microwave as they don't do to well. These should first be removed and then added back in.\n\nDescribing the outcome of the publication's taste test, it was said how the paper wrapping helped to \"revive\" the bun's original softness after going hard in the refrigerator.\n\nIt said: \"The sandwich was warmed throughout \u2014 though it cooled back down quickly, so don't take too long to eat \u2014 and the American cheese even regained some of its gooey meltiness. Overall, taste and texture were quite close to that of a fresh Bacon McDouble. And while you could use the original wrapper for similar results, you may want to think twice.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA word of warning was shared and people using the re-heating technique told to be careful after it was made clear McDonald's wrappers used to contain PFAS.\n\nThese are known as \"forever chemicals\" to their near-indestructibility on a molecular level. They have been linked to many health problems, including in some severe cases, cancer.\n\nIn 2021, McDonald's made a self-commitment to eliminate forever chemicals from its global food packaging by 2025 \u2014 a goal that was achieved at all major US fast food locations, not just McDonald's, by last year.",

Following her career as a player, McDonald has jumped into the sports media space, making appearances across NWSL broadcasts as a decorated expert on the sport and the league.\n\n\u201cI am very excited to be joining the local broadcast team for the Chicago Stars this year. It is a full circle moment to be returning to the Club who drafted me all the way back in 2010, to contribute in this way to give the fans of Chicago a great experience watching matches and hearing my perspective,\u201d said McDonald. \u201cI have been lucky enough to continue to be involved in the game since retiring, from covering a World Cup in Australia, to helping grow NWSL and women's soccer at the national and local level, and I'm looking forward to a fun season in Chicago.\u201d\n\nFOX Chicago Plus is the Stars\u2019 local English-language broadcaster partner for the 2025 season.

In 1953, she earned a Fulbright Fellowship and moved to Massachusetts to train at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital for two years. Evans completed her medical training at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1955. She briefly moved back to England to practice pediatrics but returned to the United States after learning that the field was closed to women in her home country.\n\nAfter working in pediatric oncology in Boston and Chicago, Illinois, Evans was recruited to create a pediatric oncology unit at CHOP, where she spent the rest of her medical career. In 1971, she developed the Evans Staging System for neuroblastoma \u2013 a cancer that starts in neuroblast cells and mostly affects infants and young children \u2013 to help determine disease progression and treatment efficacy. The system helped cut the mortality rate in half, and today, the survival rate is 90-95%.\n\n\u201cTo be the one who cares is one of the most rewarding experiences in a person\u2019s life,\u201d Evans once said.\n\nWhile serving as chief of oncology, Evans noticed that many out-of-town families of children receiving treatment at CHOP had no place, or no affordable place to stay in the city. In the early 1970s, she met Jim Murray, then-general manager of the Philadelphia Eagles, when the NFL team raised and donated $100,000 to the hospital for children with cancer in honor of a leukemia patient, Kim Hill \u2013 the daughter of Fred Hill, a tight end and wide receiver. At the time, another Eagles player, quarterback Roman Gabriel, was advertising seasonal Shamrock Shakes for McDonald\u2019s. (Kim Hill later died of brain cancer in 2011.)\n\nAfter Evans proposed free housing for families of children treated at CHOP, Murray reached out to Ed Rensi, McDonald\u2019s regional manager, for a donation toward purchasing a house. Rensi said yes and that he would donate proceeds from Shamrock Shake sales toward the house if it would be named the Ronald McDonald House, after the fast-food chain\u2019s clown mascot. Gabriel was inspired to later open the first Ronald McDonald House in North Carolina, his home state.\n\nDormer told the hosts of \u201cThe View\u201d television program in a March 27 interview that she \u201ccould not fathom that [Evans] wasn\u2019t a household name.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Audrey\u2019s Children] is just the most amazing tale of the most incredible woman \u2013 pioneering, determined woman,\u201d said Dormer, who met Evans before filming commenced. Evans died two weeks into filming in 2022 at age 97.\n\n\u201c[Evans] was one of those great Americans who dedicated her life to giving hope and comfort to families. She didn\u2019t just sit back; she saw the pain \u2013 the need \u2013 and she stepped into it,\u201d Pennsylvania Bishop Daniel Guti\u00e9rrez told ENS in a phone interview. \u201cShe was extraordinary in every way that it\u2019s hard even to encapsulate the profound impact she made on the world.\n\n\u201cTo know Audrey Evans \u2013 her study and her advancements in medicine, especially pediatric oncology \u2013 it\u2019s indescribable. She was a faithful Episcopalian who cared so much and who did so much. Audrey lived a life of love as a true Christian servant, living in and caring for the community.\u201d\n\nThe first Ronald McDonald House \u2013 founded by Evans, Murray, Fred Hill, Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose and McDonald\u2019s \u2013 opened in 1974 in Philadelphia. The independent nonprofit, Ronald McDonald House Charities is headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, where the McDonald\u2019s Corporation is based.\n\nToday, it operates more than 387 houses in 62 countries, all located minutes away from special care hospitals. It provides at least 2.7 million overnight stays annually. In 2023, families saved $736 million in lodging and meal expenses. The charity also provides free home-cooked meals and holistic services to families, an additional service that Evans encouraged.\n\nRonald McDonald House Charities also operates more than 271 \u201cfamily rooms\u201d inside hospitals in 28 countries, which allow families to rest while staying beside their sick children. The family rooms provide free snacks and toys, as well as a private place to shower and take a nap. Additionally, Ronald McDonald House Charities operates 41 \u201ccare mobiles\u201d in 10 countries that provide free, on-the-spot health and dental care to families in need.\n\n\u201c[Evans] was pushing the medical research world to be open to trying these new techniques to treat cancer while also pushing the CHOP to think more holistically about how their patients and their families needed to be treated, and all those efforts eventually led her to connect with the right people and found the Ronald McDonald House,\u201d Kevin Todd, director of operations and strategic initiatives at St. James School, told ENS.\n\nLike most of his colleagues and students who knew Evans personally, Todd has many fond memories of Evans, who wouldn\u2019t let age stop her from caring for others. In 2005, when she was 79, she married her longtime colleague, Dr. Giulio John D\u2019Angio, who was a pediatric radiation oncologist at CHOP, in a 7 a.m. service so that they could both go straight to work after the ceremony. Evans, a parishioner of St. Mark\u2019s Episcopal Church in Philadelphia, never had children of her own, but she was involved with St. James School until a few years before she died. She joined the students for lunch every week and got to know them on a personal level.\n\n\u201cIt was always about more than just treating the child. It was about treating everything around the child so that the child could get as much support as they needed,\u201d Todd said. \u201cWith that model, that whole ethos really was formative to how St. James was developed.\u201d\n\nTodd and his wife, assistant principal Sarah Carrol, named their daughter Audrey in honor of Evans. Audrey, who is 3 years old, is an extra in \u201cAudrey\u2019s Children,\u201d portraying a neonatal intensive care unit patient.\n\nSt. James School rented a screening room at Regal UA Main Street in the Manayunk neighborhood of Lower Northwest Philadelphia for a private early screening of \u201cAudrey\u2019s Children\u201d on March 27.\n\nEvans\u2019 presence at St. James School impacted many students and alumni, including 2019 valedictorian Ainyae Holmes, who was inspired by her to work in the medical field. Holmes, who works as a clinical research assistant at a gastroenterologist office in Chevy Chase, Maryland, is now applying to physician assistant programs.\n\n\u201cMy relationship with Dr. Evans was a great one. We had lunch one-on-one one time, and she listened as I told her I wanted to study medicine in college, and she made me feel that I was definitely on the right path,\u201d Holmes, who last saw Evans shortly after graduating high school, told ENS. \u201cLooking back, wow, I didn\u2019t realize in middle school that I was with a pioneer \u2013 this amazing, intelligent woman who was passionate about helping people in general, not just in medicine. She was someone who always wanted to give back to the community and advocate for everyone.\u201d\n\n-Shireen Korkzan is a reporter and assistant editor for Episcopal News Service.

Richard McGreevy, 29, of Whitechurch Place, Rathfarnham in County Dublin, pleaded guilty to two counts of making a threat to kill or cause harm. He received a prison sentence of three-and a-half years, with the final 15 months suspended on strict conditions, at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Wednesday. In a victim impact statement read to the court, McDonald said although McGreevy's threats frightened her, she would not allow a \"bully\" to prevent her from doing her job.\n\n'Lonely keyboard warrior'\n\nThe court heard McGreevy posted videos to TikTok on 16 July last year, in which he made threats towards McDonald and Mr Harris. The videos were viewed thousands of times and reposted on several other social media platforms. A defence barrister for McGreevy said his client was not a \"political ideologue\" but rather a \"lonely keyboard warrior\". He acted \"from impulse, not malice\", James Dwyer SC told the court.\n\n'Real and chilling'\n\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in leader and the garda commissioner were not in court during the sentence hearing on Wednesday. In a victim impact statement read to the court, McDonald said, like others in the public eye, she has become accustomed to \"routine abuse, aggression and casual threats\" online. However, this was different, she said, adding: \"The direct threat to shoot me, to shoot me 'for free', the open willingness to harm me himself, and the implicit willingness to harm me on behalf of another.\" She said the video presentation was \"bizarre, maybe even laughable\", but the threat was \"real and chilling\". \"I was afraid and angry. My family were enraged and afraid.\" McDonald told the court she had the right to live and move without fear, like any other citizen. \"The threat to shoot me 'for free' was the threat of a coward, designed to intimidate me and to encourage others to target me,\" she added. Mr Harris declined to provide a victim statement, the court heard.\n\nPA Media In a video, McGreevy said Garda Commissioner Drew Harris should be \"shot in the head\"\n\nThe expletive-laden videos were played for Judge Martin Nolan from a laptop. In them, McGreevy said Mr Harris should be \"taken to Dublin Castle\" and executed. He added the garda commissioner should be \"shot in the head by the IRA\". McGreevy said Mr Harris was \"next\" and he did not care if \"I get years for it\". The videos were posted following violence during a protest at a site in Coolock, Dublin, which had been earmarked for asylum seekers. McGreevy said he was making \"a couple of videos about what happened yesterday\". During interview McGreevy told garda\u00ed he had never had a video viewed as many times, he did not expect it to go viral and he had taken it down. Part of his letter of apology was read to the court, in which McGreevy described his actions as \"stupid\". McGreevy said he \"didn't intend to cause distress with his words\" and expressed his regret.\n\n'Extreme and frightening'\n\nJames Dwyer SC outlined his client's background, adding that McGreevy had been using cannabis since he was a teenager but was drug-free since going into custody. He noted McGreevy had an acquired brain injury and suffered physical abuse as a child. He asked the court to take into account his client's early guilty pleas, expressions of remorse, and personal circumstances. Imposing sentence, Judge Nolan said they were \"extreme and frightening threats\" to two public figures, who were entitled to their peace of mind. He said the videos would have been \"very disturbing\" for the injured parties, who would have a \"very valid belief that contributions like this poison social discourse\" and \"give permission\" to certain individuals to behave in a violent way, \"particularly to public individuals\".\n\n'Right to be worried'",

While 90% of those polled indicated that they would be returning to McDonald\u2019s to take advantage of the chain\u2019s famously inexpensive value offerings, total household penetration for the burger joint\u2019s value offers has steadily declined since September 2024 \u2014 and the McValue menu hasn\u2019t been able to reverse that trend.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s McValue Menu Is Very Popular With Existing Fans of the Golden Arches\n\nOne notable piece of data gleaned from the survey results: The vast majority of those polled (400 confirmed McValue menu patrons nationwide) suggested that they had visited McDonald\u2019s in 2024, oftentimes repeatedly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 94% of respondents indicated that they had visited McDonald\u2019s at least once during the period spanning January 2024 to June 2024, while nearly the same proportion (90%) stated they had visited three times or more during that time frame. Further, nearly three-quarters (70%) said they had visited the chain more than six times throughout the first half of 2024.\n\nThis data heavily implies that those ordering from the McValue menu are existing McDonald\u2019s customers and that most of these are frequent guests of the red-and-yellow brand.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s McValue Menu Is Converting Some Business Away From Competitors, Notably Burger King and Chick-fil-A\n\nOn the other hand, some statistics derived from the Numerator survey were a net positive for McDonald\u2019s.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 48% of respondents indicated that the McValue menu had swayed them away from eating at competing fast-food restaurants, while only a slightly lower number (44%) said they had planned to visit McDonald\u2019s in any case.\n\nOf the former, 18% said they had been persuaded away from Burger King, and 17% said they had been planning to eat Chick-fil-A before choosing the McValue menu instead. Wendy\u2019s (14%), Taco Bell (11%), Arby\u2019s (7%), and Subway (also 7%) rounded out the next few spots in this regard.\n\nAt the end of the day, the McValue menu may not have halted a sustained decline in household penetration concerning value-priced fast food, but it has created a loyal fanbase. Approximately 91% of verified McValue menu customers said they would be buying items from the menu during future visits.",

But thanks to one McDonald\u2019s location right here in the U.S., you won\u2019t need a passport to try those international menu items.\n\nFrom the outside, it looks like a regular urban McDonald\u2019s on the ground floor of an office building. The sign for \u201cHamburger University\u201d next door might tip you off that something delicious is afoot, though. That\u2019s because this location is at the McDonald\u2019s headquarters, and it\u2019s the only one in the U.S. that serves up a special menu of items from McDonald\u2019s around the world, called the Global Menu.\n\nLucky for me, I live less than two hours away from this magical place of fast-food oddities. So I hopped in the car for a little road trip to find out more about this particular McDonald\u2019s and eat everything on the Global Menu. Here\u2019s what I found out and ate on my visit, plus some important tips if you plan to go.\n\nLacey Muszynski / Cheapism\n\nWhere to Find the Global McDonald\u2019s\n\nThis unique McDonald\u2019s with the Global Menu is in Chicago, in a neighborhood called the West Loop. It\u2019s on the ground floor of the building that houses the McDonald\u2019s world headquarters, which opened in 2018. It\u2019s right next to the entrance to Hamburger University, where potential McDonald\u2019s owners and managers from around the world are trained in the art of the hamburger.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an address to put into your GPS, it\u2019s 1035 W. Randolph Street. It\u2019s helpfully named \u201cMcDonald\u2019s Global Menu Restaurant\u201d on Google Maps.\n\nLacey Muszynski / Cheapism\n\nHow the Global Menu Works\n\nThe Global Menu McDonald\u2019s serves both the standard McDonald\u2019s menu as well as the Global Menu. \u201cGlobal Favorites\u201d is its own category on the ordering kiosks and menu board, and there\u2019s a fact sheet on the front counter with information about the current Global Menu offerings.\n\nAt any given time, there are about six Global Menu items on the menu, and they rotate every few months. Sometimes they include breakfast items, but sometimes not. There usually seems to be at least two entrees, a side item, and one dessert at any given time. Each item is labeled with what country it comes from. You\u2019re free to order items from both the Global Menu and standard menu together.\n\nLacey Muszynski / Cheapism\n\nHow to Find Out What\u2019s on the Global Menu\n\nSince this is a one-of-a-kind McDonald\u2019s, it\u2019s a little tricky to find out what\u2019s currently on the Global Menu, short of actually going there. The easiest way is to use the McDonald\u2019s app, clock the Order button, choose the Global Menu location, and check out the menu. Another way is to visit the Uber Eats page for that location, which will also include the Global Favorites menu.\n\nThe current Global Menu debuted in January 2025 and is available until April 7, 2025. It\u2019s got six international McDonald's menu items, and I tried them all in a very filling and entertaining lunch.\n\nLacey Muszynski / Cheapism\n\nWhat I Ate: 280 Dijon\n\nFrance\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 280 Dijon is a favorite at McDonald\u2019s in France, according to the Global Menu fact sheet. It\u2019s got a big, rectangular ciabatta-style bun, a beef patty that\u2019s much larger and thicker than most at McDonald\u2019s, lots of cheese, roma tomato slices, and dijon mustard sauce.\n\nThis burger is meaty and cheesy, but the bun still overwhelmed everything a little. The dijon sauce is creamy and mild, and I could definitely see it being a hit on burgers in the U.S.\n\nLacey Muszynski / Cheapism\n\nSpicy Garlic Black Pepper Chicken McNuggets\n\nJapan\n\n\n\n\n\nThese Japanese McNuggets made my inner child so happy. They have the same unmistakable McNugget breading and flavor, but with a hint of garlic and a nice little punch of black pepper. This is like the grown up version of McNuggets, and they seem to be very popular because they sell out a lot (more on that later).\n\nI only wished that there was a special dipping sauce to go along with them. I tried it with sweet and sour and barbecue, and both were fine, but something spicy would be amazing.\n\nLacey Muszynski / Cheapism\n\nMasala McShaker Fries\n\nCanada\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Canada gets Indian-inspired fries, I don\u2019t know, but I do know I want them in the U.S. McShaker fries are offered around the world in many different flavors. They\u2019re called McShaker because you get a box of fries, a packet of dry seasoning, and a paper bag to shake the fries up with the seasoning. It\u2019s more fun than you\u2019d think.\n\nThe seasoning was a mild masala mix, with warm spices like coriander, cumin, and paprika, plus a touch of sweetness. McDonald\u2019s fries are top notch, but this took them to a whole new level. A+, would order again if I ever have the chance.\n\nLacey Muszynski / Cheapism\n\nBBQ Smokehouse McCrispy\n\nUK\n\n\n\n\n\nOnion lovers only for this British version of the McCrispy. It\u2019s got a fried chicken breast, white cheddar cheese, chopped romaine lettuce, sliced raw red onions, and barbecue sauce on a potato bun.\n\nThis was pretty good, but those raw onions overpower everything, so be warned. It felt very British with a slice of white cheddar (they don\u2019t add coloring to their cheddar to make it orange like America does), but the barbecue sauce tasted like the cup you get with McNuggets.\n\nLacey Muszynski / Cheapism\n\nMcPops\n\nSpain/Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\nI know that McDonald\u2019s is in the process of rolling out Krispy Kreme in its restaurants, but these little McPops donuts are way better, trust me. These cute little things are like overgrown donut holes filled with three flavors: white chocolate, Biscoff cookie butter, and berry.\n\nThe pink powdered sugar-coated berry was the best of the bunch with its jam-like sweet and tart mixed berry filling, followed by the Biscoff and its spiced filling. They were all soft and just sweet enough, and would go over well for breakfast or as a snack.\n\nLacey Muszynski / Cheapism\n\nKoldskal McFlurry\n\nDenmark\n\n\n\n\n\nI had no context for what \u201ckoldskal\u201d might be in this McFlurry, so I looked it up. It\u2019s a Danish buttermilk-based cold dessert that sometimes includes lemon or little crispy cookies. McDonald\u2019s take on that blends yellow koldskal-inspired syrup into soft serve along with little ebelskivers, a mini pancake that\u2019s normally soft, but is crunchy in this case.\n\nThis was pretty delicious, with a mild lemon flavor and buttermilk-like tang. There were lots of little round cookies mixed in, and they stayed crunchy even while I was eating everything else on the tray. I have no idea how it compares to actual koldskal, but this makes me want to try it.\n\nLacey Muszynski / Cheapism\n\nTips if You Visit the Global Menu McDonald\u2019s\n\nThere\u2019s a few things I learned during my visit to the Global Menu McDonald\u2019s that you should know if you plan on going.\n\nThe Global Menu items sell out all the time. If you want to try everything on the menu, it\u2019s best to go for lunch during the week. On the weekends, many of the international items are unavailable by dinner time. If you\u2019re concerned, check Uber Eats at various times of the day to see what typically sells out first and when, then plan your visit accordingly.\n\nThis is Chicago, so parking isn\u2019t great if you plan to drive. There is street parking in the area, and it was $4.75 per hour right in front of the building next to the McDonald\u2019s order pick up spots.\n\nYou can check out the Hamburger University lobby while you\u2019re here, which is connected to the Global Menu McDonald\u2019s dining room. If you go during the week, you\u2019ll probably see a lot of the company\u2019s corporate employees with their badge lanyards coming down to get lunch.\n\nFor more fast food taste tests and news, sign up for our free newsletters.\n\nThis article was originally published on Cheapism\n\nLacey Muszynski / Cheapism\n\nMore From Cheapism",

Several hands shot up and gave answers like cows, chickens and sheep and dogs.\n\n\u201cI have chickens at my house,\u201d Weston said, prompting his classmate, Skyler, to say, \u201cMe too.\u201d\n\nKing explained the activity for the day, involving blank barn canvases, animal stickers and creating number sentences, or math problems.\n\n\u201cYour job is to pick no more than five animal stickers and make two groups of two different animals,\u201d she said. \u201cAll together, your two groups should equal five.\u201d\n\nFarmer King selected three sheep and one sheep dog and asked how many other animals could fit in her barn.\n\nHer students answered in unison, \u201cOne!\u201d\n\n\u201cWrite your number sentence,\u201d she told the class. \u201cOne plus four equals how many?\u201d\n\nKing\u2019s kindergartners responded, \u201cFive!\u201d Then, it was their turn to choose their animals and create a number sentence.\n\nA lover of all things nature and farming, according to her teacher, Skyler sat at her desk, puzzled with her four cow stickers and one rooster.\n\n\u201cThis barn isn\u2019t big enough for all my cows,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter figuring out how to layer her stickers so they all fit on her barn, she shared something she learned about farm animals: \u201cCows give us milk, chickens give us eggs but dogs don\u2019t give us anything we eat.\u201d\n\nFrom Farm to Market\n\nLearning to identify farm animals and the kinds of products and food farms produce is part of Caledonia Elementary\u2019s Core Knowledge Language Arts curriculum. Students also learn how plants can make their own food and that animals eat plants and other living things to get their nutrition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned about how we get the milk and eggs from farms to the grocery store and in the spring, we take a field trip to a local dairy farm,\u201d King explained.\n\nCaledonia Elementary kindergartners learned addition from counting sheep and other farm animals\n\nAcross the hall in Kelly Peterson\u2019s classroom, kindergartners watched a video reading of a picture book explaining how food travels from farms to markets for people to buy and farmers to earn their income.\n\n\u201cYou can use fresh milk from cows to make your own butter or ice cream,\u201d she said, prompting a chorus of \u201coooo\u2019s\u201d and \u201cahhhh\u2019s.\u201d\n\nPeterson also explained some of their additional learning goals. Those include reading and explaining how crops become food, demonstrating understanding of farm-related vocabulary words, and writing the sequence of events of getting food from farm to market.\n\nShe asked her students, \u201cWhat would happen if we didn\u2019t have farms?\u201d\n\nOne student replied, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have food and we would all die.\u201d\n\nRead more from Caledonia:\n\n\u2022 Kindergarten language arts unit gets royal treatment\n\n\u2022 Whole Brain Teaching is elementary",

He's 13th lawyer during murder saga\n\nAttorney David Eugene McDonald, of Olathe-based Rivera Law, LLC, has been appointed standby counsel to aid Dana Chandler as she seeks a fourth trial after being convicted of two 2002 Topeka gunshot deaths, court records show.\n\nMcDonald is the 13th attorney to represent or assist Chandler since she was first charged in the case in 2011, according to those records.\n\nChandler, 65, was convicted March 7 of two counts of first-degree murder in the gunshot deaths of her ex-husband, Michael Sisco, 47, and his fianc\u00e9e, Karen Harkness, 53.\n\nWhy did Chandler ask for help?\n\nChandler, who served as her own attorney at her recent trial after firing her court-appointed attorneys, asked for legal assistance after telling Rios on Thursday she was submitting several post-conviction motions, including one seeking a new trial.\n\nRios told Chandler she would seek to find an attorney to assist her in the case, for which the next hearing will be at 4:30 p.m. Thursday as part of a criminal assignment docket in Shawnee County District Court in Topeka.\n\nChandler told Rios she intended to continue to represent herself in court but needed someone to provide her legal help regarding procedural and substantive matters.\n\nWho is David Eugene McDonald?\n\nMcDonald is a 2009 graduate of Washburn Law School, according to his LinkedIn page.\n\nMcDonald was the subject of news coverage in December 2014 when he was punched in the face in Shawnee County District Court by Lance L. Franklin, a client he was representing at his trial on charges that included three counts of rape.\n\nMcDonald later testified that he suffered a broken nose and a concussion, lost his vision for about a week and underwent surgery for a deviated septum caused by the punch. He also suffered cuts, bruises and chipped teeth.\n\nFranklin was subsequently sentenced to prison on convictions for aggravated robbery in the case for which McDonald was defending him and for aggravated battery to McDonald. He will be released at the earliest in 2033, Kansas Department of Corrections records say.\n\nMcDonald has been admitted to the bar in 2010 in Kansas, in 2015 in Oregon and in 2021 in Missouri, according to the website for Rivera Law, LLC, which says he has defended clients in five notable murder cases.\n\nThose clients include Trevor Gilmore, who was acquitted in 2020 in Oregon of two counts of aggravated murder and three counts of unlawful use of weapons after saying he acted in self-defense in 2018 when he fatally shot Justin Severnak, 38, and Christopher Wayne Lyon, 42.\n\nGilmore was found guilty of one lesser count of manslaughter in the death of Lyon, according to the website for Salt Lake City TV station KTVX, which quoted McDonald as describing the situation as \"incredibly sad.\"\n\nContact Tim Hrenchir at threnchir@gannett.com or 785-213-5934.",

From Krispy Kreme\u2019s Taste O\u2019Luck collection to Arby\u2019s celebratory free sandwiches, there\u2019s no shortage of festive treats to snag this weekend.\n\n\n\nArguably the most highly anticipated St. Patrick\u2019s Day-themed menu item is McDonald\u2019s beloved Shamrock Shake, which made its grand return last month. A seasonal icon since its nationwide debut in 1970, the Shamrock Shake remains a fan-favorite year after year.\n\n\n\nBut now, the classic shake may have met its match. Dutch Bros is shaking up the competition with its latest menu drop, introducing one treat in particular that could steal the spotlight from McDonald\u2019s minty staple.\n\n\n\nDutch Bros Celebrates St. Patrick's Day With 2 New Drinks\n\nDutch Bros may have just launched its spring menu, but that\u2019s not stopping the coffee chain from rolling out more festive creations. To celebrate St. Patrick\u2019s Day, the drive-thru coffee company has introduced two new green-themed drinks that bring full-force holiday spirit.\n\n\n\nFirst up is the Emerald Rebel, an electrifying twist on the brand\u2019s signature energy drink. Instead of the expected mint flavor, this neon-green beverage blends Dutch Bros\u2019 Rebel energy drink base with blue raspberry, kiwi, and a swirl of sweet cream. One reviewer described it as \"electricity in [their] mouth.\"\n\n\n\nNext up, we have the Lucky Mint Shake, a frozen treat that looks strikingly similar to McDonald\u2019s beloved Shamrock Shake. This rich, minty milkshake is topped with the brand\u2019s signature Soft Top and crumbled brownie pieces. According to fans, it boasts a bold mint flavor, while still tasting very similar to the McDonald's favorite.\n\n\"Just struck GOLD!!\" one commenter raved.\n\n\n\nDutch Bros isn\u2019t the only chain looking to cash in on mint-flavored madness. Last month, Jack in the Box unveiled its Lucky Mint Trio, featuring an Oreo Mint Shake, Oreo Mint Mocha Sweet Cream Iced Coffee, and Mint Twisted Soda\u2014all designed to satisfy seasonal cravings.\n\n\n\nMint and green-themed treats are a St. Patrick\u2019s Day staple, and every year, new drinks try\u2014and fail\u2014to dethrone the Shamrock Shake. McDonald\u2019s iconic mint shake has remained undefeated, but if any drink has a shot at stealing the spotlight, it just might be Dutch Bros\u2019 latest creation.\n\n\n\nStill, Dutch Bros fans (myself included) are eager to put these new creations to the test. Whether you're craving an energizing kick from the Emerald Rebel or a creamy, minty indulgence from the Lucky Mint Shake, these limited-time sips are here for a short run\u2014so grab one while you can!\n\n\n\nRead the original article on ALLRECIPES",

            "content": "Chine McDonald\u2019s new book will free mothers from perfectionism as it challenges religious expectations that burden women. With a fresh perspective on the Virgin Mary, Unmaking Mary invites readers to embrace a more authentic, grace-filled approach, says our reviewer\n\nAs a Protestant, and particularly from a Presbyterian perspective, Mary has never played a central role in shaping my understanding of motherhood - or so I thought before reading Unmaking Mary: Shattering the Myth of Perfect Motherhood (Hodder & Stoughton).\n\nI suspect Chine McDonald may have approached this topic with similar assumptions before exploring the deeper constructs of what it truly means to be a mother. What defines a mother? How should she be understood? In this book, the author challenges cultural and societal myths about motherhood that often leave women feeling inadequate and encourages a more grace-filled, biblically grounded understanding.\n\nMcDonald carefully dismantles conventional expectations of motherhood. Drawing from her own journey - pregnancy, the newborn stage, returning to work, and the ever-present fears of raising a child - she offers an honest and deeply relatable perspective. As a mother, I found her insights painfully familiar and readers who have experienced motherhood will recognise the expectations, pressures, and judgments placed upon them.\n\nWe are invited to explore the character of Mary afresh - to see her not as a distant, untouchable figure, but as a woman who experienced the same struggles, challenges, and realities of motherhood as the rest of us. Far from being merely a passive character, McDonald presents Mary as a disciple, a leader, and even the catalyst for Christ\u2019s first miracle. She urges readers to see Mary in a fuller, richer light - not just as the mother of Jesus but as a prophet who boldly proclaimed a new world order through The Magnificat. She challenges traditional, one-dimensional portrayals and invites readers to reconsider Mary\u2019s significance in a way that is empowering and deeply relatable.\n\nSome still view Mary as immaculate, sinless, and the ideal mother, but McDonald examines how her image has been shaped by history and socio-political narratives. She traces Mary\u2019s evolving significance, from veneration in some traditions to her diminished role post-Reformation, urging readers to see her beyond tradition. While she challenges these portrayals, McDonald does not advocate for worship of Mary and emphasises that our relationship with God is what truly matters.\n\nMcDonald dismantles motherhood myths without diminishing Mary, aiming instead to free modern mothers from perfectionism. She exposes the relentless pressures placed on women: to breastfeed, to be fit, to be beautiful, to maintain an organised and domesticated life, to serve as the spiritual guide for their children, to be their constant protector, and to somehow craft flawless futures for them. The emotional burden, she argues, is simply too great. With honesty and conviction, she rejects the \u201chaving it all\u201d myth, instead advocating for grace, authenticity, and freedom.\n\nMcDonald is bold in her critique, particularly in addressing the role of the patriarchal church in shaping and sustaining the myth of the perfect mother. She argues that the church has, at times, been complicit in reinforcing these unattainable ideals, placing an undue burden on women. Her perspective is provocative - particularly for readers who hold to a more conservative, complementarian view. She suggests that traditional structures rooted in power, dominance, and male elevation, have contributed to a limited understanding of God\u2019s nature, one that sidelines the richness of feminine characteristics.\n\nMcDonald wants her readers to look beyond Mary and consider the often-overlooked maternal nature of God. She highlights how this aspect of God\u2019s character has frequently been missed or overshadowed, prompting a deeper exploration of divine nurture and care. Again, in provocative fashion, she suggests that Mary\u2019s elevation to near-divine status in some traditions may stem from a need to find femininity within a predominantly patriarchal understanding of God. Not everyone will agree with her conclusions, but she offers a different perspective that challenges conventional narratives and invites a richer, more expansive view of both motherhood and the divine. If nothing else her writing is sure to spark important conversations as she offers a fresh lens through which to engage with faith, gender, and spirituality.\n\nShe also examines modern representations of motherhood, from Marian artwork and Christian iconography, to social media\u2019s portrayal of the ideal mother. These hyper-real projections create a misleading image, concealing the challenges of motherhood and ultimately causing harm. She continually urges her readers to embrace authenticity. McDonald also highlights the idealised portrayal of Mary as a fair-skinned, blue-eyed, and rosy-cheeked blessed virgin. She explores the significance of Black Madonnas and their connection to the marginalised and exploring Mary who experienced suffering. Conscious of not excluding the experiences of all mothers, McDonald also touches on Mary\u2019s suffering which fosters a deeper connection with mothers who have endured the unnatural grief of losing a child.\n\nWhile rooted in scripture, this book is not purely theological. Instead, McDonald blends personal experience, social critique, and theological insight creating a compelling and thought-provoking read. Well-researched, thorough, and refreshingly honest, she challenges long-held perceptions of Mary and ultimately aims to liberate readers from the version of her that has historically oppressed women. Her goal is to reclaim an authentic Mary, one who comforts rather than condemns, one who liberates rather than burdens. This is a necessary and compelling read, inviting mothers to reflect, reassess, and embrace a more authentic understanding of their role.\n\nI hadn\u2019t considered Mary\u2019s influence on my own understanding of motherhood until now. This book has helped me unravel the expectations I once felt bound by, and that has been truly freeing.",

Some take it as their time to greet the day slowly with a cup of coffee and a simple meal of eggs, oatmeal, or toast. Others lean into extravagant brunch dishes to nourish and impress, like Roasted Tomato Quiche or Stuffed Ham-And-Cheese Croissant Casserole. (My Southern great-grandmother fell somewhere in the middle, preparing around five dozen buttermilk biscuits each morning to feed her family of seven.) Our breakfast traditions run the gamut.\n\nBut there is also an intersection where deliciousness meets convenience, and that\u2019s where you\u2019ll find one fan-favorite McDonald\u2019s menu item: the Bagel Sandwich.\n\nFirst introduced in 1999, McDonald\u2019s Bagel Sandwiches\u2014then, an egg plus protein of choice\u2014quickly gained fans for being a comprehensive breakfast on-the-go. According to New York Post, the global fast-food chain took standalone bagels off its breakfast menu in 2020.\n\nThe sandwiches were only available at participating McDonald\u2019s locations across the country, but had garnered a passionate base. In fact, fans went so far as to create a public spreadsheet of where Bagel Sandwiches could be found across the country.\n\nBut now, we have good news: For the first time ever, Bagel Sandwiches are available in every McDonald\u2019s restaurant in the United States. Seriously!\n\nMcDonald's McDonald's Steak, Egg & Cheese Bagel\n\nThe first breakfast sandwich option is the Bacon, Egg & Cheese Bagel with thick-cut Applewood smoked bacon, a fluffy folded egg, creamy breakfast sauce, and two slices of American cheese.\n\nThe second is a Steak, Egg & Cheese Bagel\u2014a juicy steak patty with a fluffy folded egg, American cheese, creamy breakfast sauce, and savory grilled onions.\n\nAnd finally, we can\u2019t forget about the classic Egg & Cheese Bagel\u2014fluffy egg, breakfast sauce, and American cheese. Of course, each and every bagel is toasted to golden perfection. McDonald's also confirmed that the Sausage, Egg & Cheese Bagel will be joining menus nationwide.\n\nThis announcement from McDonald\u2019s comes alongside the company\u2019s celebration of 50 years of the Egg McMuffin, their most popular breakfast menu item. There are a couple other breakfast perks you may not want to miss:\n\nEgg McMuffin Day: On Sunday, March 2, grab a classic Egg McMuffin or Sausage McMuffin with Egg through the McDonald\u2019s app for just $1.\n\nMcDelivery: From March 3-30, get a BOGO Sausage McMuffin with Egg when ordering delivery through the app.\n\n\u201cAt McDonald's, breakfast isn't just a meal; it's a cherished tradition and cornerstone of our brand,\u201d said McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger.\n\n\u201cEvery morning when we open our doors, we are a breakfast restaurant. Whether it\u2019s my personal favorite, the Egg McMuffin, or our crispy Hash Browns, fluffy hotcakes, or sweet and savory McGriddles, we\u2019re all about giving our customers the best start to their day. Our fans know they can always count on us for a one-of-a-kind breakfast experience, anchored in great value and high-quality ingredients.\u201d\n\nWhat an egg-cellent way to start your day!\n\nRead the original article on Southern Living",

Blount, president emeritus of Union Presbyterian Seminary in Richmond, Virginia, and Charlotte, North Carolina, serves as Candler School of Theology \u2019s 2024-25 Alonzo L. McDonald Family Chair on The Life and Teachings of Jesus and Their Impact on Culture. In this role, Blount will present public in-person lectures on Wednesday, April 16, and Wednesday, April 23.\n\nThe McDonald Lectures are free and open to the public and will take place in Room 252 of Candler\u2019s Rita Anne Rollins Building. Registration is required and a livestream option will also be available.\n\nBlount earned his MDiv from Princeton Theological Seminary and his PhD from Emory University\u2019s Graduate Division of Religion. Before coming to Union Presbyterian Seminary, he served for 15 years as Richard J. Dearborn Professor of New Testament Interpretation at Princeton Theological Seminary, and as pastor of Carver Memorial Presbyterian Church in Newport News, Virginia, from 1982-88.\n\nThe lectures are made possible by the McDonald Agape Foundation.\n\nDetails about Blount\u2019s McDonald Lectures are below.\n\n\u201cBefore He Was White: Jesus, Mark and the Politics of Inclusion\u201d\n\nWednesday, April 16\n\n11 a.m.\u20131 p.m.\n\nRita Anne Rollins Building, Room 252\n\nIn \u201cBefore He was White: Jesus, Mark and the Politics of Inclusion,\u201d Blount will analyze cultural location and its impact on biblical meaning. How do readers configure Jesus when he is perceived through the ongoing and turbulent American dialogue about race? One of the most controversial components of this discussion has to do with Jesus\u2019s race and what his racial identity means for our understanding of his ministry. For what reason did God intervene in human history in the person and ministry of Jesus? And in what way does the racial lens through which we view Jesus shape the answer to that question?\n\n\u201cThe Narrative Color of Jesus in the Gospel of Mark\u201d\n\nWednesday, April 23\n\n4\u20135:30 p.m.\n\nRita Anne Rollins Building, Room 252\n\n\n\nNarratively speaking, how is Jesus of Nazareth \u201ccolored\u201d in the Gospel of Mark? This lecture will interrogate the correlation between Jesus\u2019s actions and his racialization. Jesus\u2019s boundary-breaking activity, and the assertiveness in which he engages that activity, hint at a \u201ccolor\u201d that fits a particular racial performance.\n\nAbout the McDonald Chair\n\nThe Alonzo L. McDonald Family Chair on the Life and Teachings of Jesus and Their Impact on Culture is supported by gifts from the McDonald Agape Foundation, founded by Alonzo L. McDonald, a longtime trustee of Emory University. The McDonald Agape Foundation \u201csupports lectures and other public presentations that deal creatively and imaginatively with the person and teachings of Jesus as they shape and form culture.\u201d\n\nRecipients are given a distinguished visiting professorship, in which they speak and teach in the focused area of Jesus\u2019s effect on culture and, conversely, culture\u2019s shaping of the figure of Jesus.\n\nPast McDonald chair lecturers include Judge John T. Noonan of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; composer Alice Parker; art historian Herbert Kessler; historian and documentary filmmaker Randall Balmer; author James Carroll; Episcopal priest and bestselling author Barbara Brown Taylor; Pulitzer Prize-winning author and historian Garry Wills; Jesuit priest and film professor Lloyd Baugh; United Methodist Bishop Hee-Soo Jung; and theological scholars David H.

            "content": "When McDonald\u2019s launched a brief food safety ad at the end of 2024, it raised eyebrows in an industry that typically avoids such topics \u2014 especially after an E. coli outbreak tied to Quarter Pounders sickened 49 people across 10 states, hospitalized 10, and caused one death, prompting the chain to temporarily pull items and investigate suppliers.\n\nPatrick Quade, CEO of DineSafe, IWasPoisoned and SafelyHQ, recently pointed out this anomaly in a LinkedIn post, noting that despite McDonald\u2019s estimated $1 billion U.S. advertising budget, the ad ran for just four days with a media spend of less than $700,000 \u2014 barely a blip at under 0.1 percent of their total ad expenditure.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s pitch was cautious, emphasizing care and quality without directly mentioning foodborne illness or E. coli: \u201cAt every local McDonald\u2019s, serving a great bite starts with putting care into everything. First, our suppliers make sure they meet our high standards at every step. Next, daily food quality checks at every restaurant, over 13 million a year. From plants to plates, we\u2019re investing along our supply chain to make sure each meal is made right. So you can feel good about every first bite. \u2018Now Serving Quality\u2019.\u201d\n\n--> -->\n\nBut was it a genuine step toward transparency, or a fleeting response to scrutiny? And how does this fit into the broader history of food safety advertising by companies?\n\nQuade\u2019s post sparked debate. Some critics of McDonald\u2019s viewed the short run ad as damage control rather than a committed shift to compete on food safety. One commenter said, \u201cIf they were serious about food safety as a competitive advantage, they\u2019d keep this ad running and expand the message.\u201d Others in food safety, marketing and brand strategy circles are asking: Did it hit the mark? To answer that, we need to look back at how companies have historically approached food safety in advertising\u2014and whether it works.\n\nA quiet history: Food safety ads as the exception, not the rule\n\nFood safety advertising by corporations is rare, primarily because of the risks of scrutiny and negative publicity. As Quade said, the food sector tends to avoid competing on this front. Historically, companies have preferred to emphasize taste, convenience or value \u2014 attributes that entice rather than reassure. When food safety does appear in ads, it\u2019s often a reactive move tied to crises rather than a proactive strategy.\n\n--> -->\n\nTake the 1993 Jack in the Box E. coli outbreak, one of the most infamous food safety scandals in U.S. history. After undercooked beef patties led to four deaths and more than 700 illnesses, the fast-food chain focused on overhauling its operations rather than launching safety-focused ads. It adopted the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system \u2014 a first for a fast-food company \u2014 and quietly rebuilt trust through action rather than promotion. Advertising that followed focused on winning back customers with deals and new menu items, not explicit safety pledges. It wasn\u2019t until years later that subtle nods to improved standards crept into their branding, but never as a central theme.\n\nSimilarly, after the 2006 E. coli outbreak linked to Dole\u2019s bagged spinach, which caused three deaths and 205 illnesses, the company\u2019s response was more about crisis management \u2014 recalls and public statements \u2014 than sustained advertising. When ads resumed, they leaned on quality and freshness, not safety assurances. This pattern holds across the food industry: post-outbreak ads tend to sidestep direct mentions of safety, focusing instead on restoring brand image indirectly.\n\n--> -->\n\nEffectiveness and fallout: Can ads restore trust?\n\nResearch and historical examples indicate that when companies do advertise food safety, it\u2019s often after outbreaks \u2014 and typically short-lived. A 2013 study in Foods journal noted that food safety incidents cost the U.S. economy $7 billion annually, a figure that\u2019s likely grown far larger in the past decade, with much of that tied to recalls, lawsuits and lost consumer trust.\n\nCompanies like Westland/Hallmark Meat Packing, which recalled 143 million pounds of beef in 2008 after a massive E. coli scare, never had a chance to pivot to safety-centric ads; they went bankrupt under the weight of $500 million in settlements. The lesson? Outbreaks often leave little room for advertising recovery.\n\nChipotle\u2019s response to its 2015-2016 E. coli and norovirus outbreaks offers a rare counterexample. After multiple incidents sickened more than 500 people, the chain launched a 2016 campaign with \u201cA Love Story,\u201d a short film blending content marketing with advertising, highlighting fresh ingredients while accompanying ads emphasized rigorous safety protocols like supplier partnerships and employee training to rebuild trust explicitly. It was a rare departure, but the campaign was short-lived. Chipotle\u2019s stock took years to recover, suggesting the ads softened the blow but weren\u2019t a silver bullet.\n\n--> -->\n\nHere\u2019s an example of Chipotle\u2019s food safety advertising\n\n\n\nDo food safety ads work? The research says it\u2019s complicated\n\nEffectiveness is where the rubber meets the road, and here, the data is murky. A 2011 study published in The Journal of Food Protection explored consumer responses to food safety messaging post-outbreak. It found that explicit safety claims could reassure some customers but risked reminding others of past failures \u2014 essentially reopening old wounds.\n\nFor McDonald\u2019s, the vague \u201cgreat first bite\u201d phrasing sidesteps this trap, implying safety without dwelling on it. Critics argue this ambiguity dilutes its impact; if safety\u2019s the goal, why not say it outright?\n\nBroader research on crisis communication supports this skepticism. A 2007 study published in Public Relations Review found that post-crisis ads work best when paired with tangible action \u2014 like Chipotle\u2019s supplier audits or Jack in the Box\u2019s HACCP adoption. McDonald\u2019s ad, lacking specifics, might register as noise to savvy consumers who\u2019ve seen recalls and headlines. A 2020 Food Research International meta-analysis on food handler training interventions found that knowledge improves with education, but behavior change lags without sustained effort. By analogy, a four-day ad might inform but not convince.\n\n--> -->\n\nConsumer perception adds another layer. A 2024 PIRG report noted that 48 million Americans fall ill from contaminated food annually, fueling distrust in food brands. McDonald\u2019s ad, aired amid this backdrop, faces an uphill battle in altering consumer perceptions, especially if it remains a one-off campaign.\n\nIndustry norms and strategic caution\n\nQuade\u2019s observation about the ad\u2019s brevity \u2014 four days for less than $700,000 \u2014 points to a deeper industry truth: food safety is a third rail. Companies fear that spotlighting it invites scrutiny of past lapses or implies ongoing risk. Firms like Taco Bell and Wendy\u2019s, hit by outbreaks in the 2000s, kept safety messaging minimal and fleeting, favoring menu relaunches over mea culpas.\n\nThe timing, post-2024 outbreak, suggests a calculated response \u2014 enough to signal care, not enough to over-commit. Critics may be right: If McDonald\u2019s saw safety as a competitive edge, why stop at four days? The answer might lie in risk aversion. A prolonged campaign could amplify calls for transparency \u2014 say, about supplier practices or inspection data \u2014 that McDonald\u2019s isn\u2019t ready to meet.\n\n--> -->\n\nUltimately, the bigger story is what this reveals about the industry: Food safety ads remain the exception, not the rule. Until a company \u2014 McDonald\u2019s or otherwise \u2014breaks this cycle with a sustained, transparent push, safety will stay a whisper in advertising, not a shout. McDonald\u2019s may have stirred conversation, but without sustained action, trust remains off the menu.\n\nWatch the McDonald\u2019s ad here.\n\n(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)",

            "content": "By Matthew Young, RealWV\n\nWeek-six under the Big Top proved to be both informative and eye-opening, as the Mountain State\u2019s mostly-elected leaders tackled the major issues impacting our state.\n\nOn Tuesday, Del. Brandon Steele fired the first salvo in what will surely become known to history as the \u201cClown Wars,\u201d when, while giving an impassioned floor speech in the House Chamber, he accused Ronald McDonald of committing serial homicide.\n\nMcDonald, the oft-maligned mascot of the McDonalds hamburger chain, was inadvertently drawn into House member\u2019s debate of HB 2752, the Del. Cathie Hess Crouse-introduced bill which seeks to allow operators to stand while riding a motorcycle. An amendment was proposed which would remove the requirement that motorcycle riders 21-years-of-age and older wear helmets, prompting Steele to reference the murder rate of his fast food counterpart in his support of the amendment.\n\n\u201cRonald McDonald has killed a whole lot more people than a motorcycle crash, and that\u2019s no accident,\u201d Steele said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to protect people from themselves, let\u2019s just amend the bill to outlaw McDonalds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI swear \u2013 when I sneak out of here everyday so I don\u2019t have to deal with all of y\u2019all, [\u2026] I see half of you walking to Taco Bell and McDonalds, and everything else, and you\u2019re gonna come in here and tell everybody to wear a motorcycle helmet,\u201d Steele continued.\n\n\u201cWe lose more people to heart disease in West Virginia than anything else,\u201d Steele added. \u201cI don\u2019t see anybody out in the gallery with signs that say \u2018Stop the Big Mac.\u2019 [\u2026] Maybe Medicaid should stop paying claims for people who run down to Golden Corral and hook themselves up to a pump of fat and nonsense everyday. [\u2026] We love freedom when it comes to food, but not the guy riding down the street without a motorcycle helmet on.\u201d\n\nDespite Steele\u2019s fierce offensive volley, Ronald McDonald won the day, and the amendment was defeated. However, the unamended version of HB 2752 was adopted by the House on Wednesday, prompting House Minority Whip Shawn Fluharty to excitedly blurt out \u201cVroom, vroom, West Virginia!\u201d on the House floor.\n\nIt is unclear if the Legislature will choose to investigate the claims made by Steele against Ronald McDonald. With the capacity of their Commission on Special Investigations being reduced after the Wednesday arrest of Senior Investigator Kenneth McCord for the alleged receipt of child pornography, Ronald McDonald may be the inadvertent beneficiary of an overwhelmed legislative bureaucracy.\n\nHowever, one investigation that is moving forward this week is that of Gov. Patrick Morrisey and Attorney General J.B. McCuskey into what the governor called \u201ca miscarriage of justice and robbery at the highest level.\u201d\n\nMorrisey was of course referring to West Virginia University\u2019s exclusion from the 2025 NCAA \u201cMarch Madness\u201d tournament, which he believes to be retribution for a 2023 lawsuit he filed on behalf of West Virginia.\n\n\u201cThis thing reeks of corruption,\u201d Morrisey charged in a Tuesday morning press conference. \u201cI brought litigation against the NCAA a few years ago. [\u2026] West Virginia was out in front suing (the NCAA) in 2023. Is this retribution? We\u2019re gonna have to get to the bottom of that.\u201d\n\nMorrisey then announced that he had directed McCuskey to launch an investigation \u201cto determine if any backroom deals, corruption, bribes, or any nefarious activity occurred during the selection process.\u201d\n\nMorrisey\u2019s reaction to WVU exclusion from the tournament brought West Virginia significant national attention. While WVU alumnus and talk show host Pat McAfee supported Morrisey\u2019s efforts, many others did not. College basketball analyst Ken Pomeroy called the 68 teams selected \u201centirely predictable,\u201d while ESPN\u2019s Stephen A. Smith called Morrisey\u2019s reaction \u201cembarrassing.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the harshest criticism to Morrisey\u2019s call for an investigation came from USA Today\u2019s Dan Wolken, who, in his Tuesday column, referred to Morrisey and McCuskey as, \u201cA gasbag governor and his obsequious sidekick grandstanding to their political base, sticking their nose into a place it doesn\u2019t belong, and making a mockery of the real problems in a state that has plenty of them.\u201d\n\nThe investigation ordered by Morrisey remains ongoing.\n\nDespite the national backlash, it was not Morrisey\u2019s spat with the NCAA that led to party in-fighting with fellow Republican Rupie Phillips. On Wednesday, the senator from Logan County took objection to Morrisey\u2019s refusal to meet with what Phillips called \u201csomeone about trying to lower the (utility) rates as they consider microgrids,\u201d referencing Morrisey\u2019s plan to allow more microgrids to operate with the state.\n\n\u201cI tried to set up a meeting with someone about lowering the rates\u2026the microgrids,\u201d Phillips told colleagues Wednesday from the floor of the Senate Chamber. \u201cWell, the gentleman from New Jersey chose not to meet with the group of people I wanted to meet with.\u201d\n\nIn response to Phillips\u2019 comments, Morrisey Communications Director Alex Lanfranconi posted on social media, \u201cThe gentleman from Logan (Phillips) was a Democrat the entire Obama Administration. If anyone is out of place in the conservative state of West Virginia, it sure as hell isn\u2019t the governor.\u201d\n\nMorrisey\u2019s plan, otherwise known as HB 2014, is currently in the possession of the House Committee on Energy and Public Works.\n\nIn the House, the sage of SB 460 \u2013 affectionately known as the \u201cvaccine bill\u201d \u2013 added two new chapters this week, as lawmakers both removed and returned certain allowable exceptions to West Virginia\u2019s immunization requirements.\n\nAs written, SB 460 allows immunization exemptions for those with documented medical reasons, or who have religious or philosophical objections. On Tuesday, the House Health Committee amended the bill, removing exemptions for those with religious or philosophical objections, but leaving exemptions for medical reasons. On Friday, House members voted to reinsert religious and philosophical objections. SB 460 will be on third reading Monday, and the expectation is that it will pass.\n\nSB 460 will codify a January executive order issued by Morrisey. It was passed in the Senate on Feb. 21, by a vote of 20-12. Assuming it passes the House on Monday, Morrisey will no doubt waste little time in signing it into law.\n\nThere are now 21 days remaining in the Regular Session. Although Tuesday was the last day for delegates to introduce bills to the House, Senators have until Monday to propose new legislation.\n\nOh and in case you\u2019re wondering, the bill requiring legislators to pass a drug test before getting paid is still collecting dust in the bottom of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s closet.",

Allyse Pulliam/For the Times Union\n\nGOSHEN \u2014 In life and death, Megan McDonald\u2019s story has been about relationships \u2014 boyfriends, colleagues, lifelong guy friends, best girlfriends, and coworkers who became pals. She ran in multiple social circles with little overlap except for the member who tied them together: Megan.\n\nOver the past week, these people have been drawn together again for an important chapter in her story: the trial of Edward Holley, McDonald\u2019s friend and former boyfriend accused of killing her 22 years ago.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe second week of the trial began with testimony from Damian Lewis, a 48-year-old man living in Florida who was dating McDonald when she died. Prosecutors also called to testify Jessica Cox, McDonald\u2019s former boss, and her coworker-friends Jennifer Malinowski and Melissa Fuller. Michael Russell, a former close friend of McDonald and Holley, also took the stand.\n\nPerhaps the most significant testimony thus far has come from Lateshia Simpson, McDonald\u2019s best friend. She\u2019s also the sister of McDonald\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Paul \u201cPauly\u201d Simpson III, with whom McDonald had a volatile relationship and Holley has speculated to police was involved in her murder.\n\nProsecutors have said McDonald spent the last evening of her life hanging out with Lateshia Simpson in Middletown. And, based on testimony at trial, it appears Lateshia was the first to raise alarms when McDonald went missing. Her testimony lasted nearly the whole day Tuesday.\n\nThe Murder of Megan McDonald newsletter Stay up to date with the latest updates in the 2003 case and the upcoming trial of Edward V. Holley. Sign up here.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe trial is expected to last until April 11. While it appears prosecutors have focused thus far on laying the foundation of their case \u2014 which should be halfway finished \u2014 they\u2019ve offered few clues so far as to how Holley is connected to McDonald\u2019s murder. The defense has continued to try and cast doubt over the police investigation and poke holes in nearly every witness\u2019 testimony.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s last evening\n\nProsecutors have loosely mapped out the events leading to McDonald\u2019s death, starting with the evening of March 13, 2003. Testimony from McDonald\u2019s friends has filled in some details.\n\nThat night, Billy Russell \u2014 brother of Michael Russell, and a close friend of Holley and McDonald \u2014 was hosting his 21st birthday party at his home on Greenway Terrace. McDonald briefly stopped by in her car and spoke to the brothers outside before leaving to hang out with her \u201cMiddletown friends.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nMichael Russell testified Monday that it seemed \u201cunusual\u201d for Megan to skip celebrating her close friend\u2019s milestone. But according to Russell, she didn\u2019t decline to stay to avoid seeing Holley \u2014 which contradicts part of the story investigators have told for years.\n\nRather, Lateshia Simpson testified that McDonald came to her house in Middletown, where she helped Simpson put her two young children to bed. They shared some cocaine, put in a load of McDonald\u2019s laundry and watched \u201cFriends.\u201d McDonald had to work the next day. To come down from her high, McDonald made multiple calls searching for marijuana.\n\nHer search was unsuccessful, according to Simpson, and McDonald told her she was going home to sleep. But Damian Lewis, McDonald\u2019s then-boyfriend, said McDonald told him over the phone she was going to buy weed before going home. Lewis did not join her; he was on parole after serving jail time for a drug conviction and had a curfew. Lewis believed their last conversation was around midnight.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nAround that time, Neal Corcoran, a friend-of-a-friend, saw McDonald enter a gas station near Wisner Avenue and Route 211. She asked the clerk for a \u201cDutch,\u201d a cigar brand her friend group commonly used to smoke weed. According to testimony from McDonald\u2019s friend and coworker, Jennifer Malinowski, they would unroll the cigars, replace the tobacco with marijuana, and roll them back up into blunts.\n\nA high school photo of Megan McDonald is shown in her sister Karen Whalen\u2019s scrapbook on Feb. 16, 2024, during an interview at the Times Union newsroom. McDonald was killed in 2003 at age 20. Will Waldron/Times Union\n\nMcDonald was next seen returning to Billy Russell\u2019s party, according to Malinowski, who was leaving the apartment after midnight. Malinowski asked McDonald if she wanted any weed, but she said no \u2014 she had a blunt. The friends went their separate ways.\n\nThis is where knowledge of McDonald\u2019s whereabouts usually ends. The prosecution claimed in opening statements at the trial that she was later killed inside her car by Holley. The indictment charging him with second-degree murder alleges he did not act alone.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nPolice found a cigar butt in the ashtray of McDonald\u2019s car, which had been abandoned in a parking lot at Kensington Manor apartments, a four-minute drive from Billy Russell\u2019s birthday party. It had Pauly Simpson\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s DNA on it, according to a State Police analyst who testified earlier in the trial.\n\nBut nobody has testified yet to the contents of the cigar or how long it had been there, which could indicate whether it was a blunt McDonald smoked the night of her death. And no one has placed Pauly Simpson in the car that fateful night.\n\nFriends share emotional testimony\n\nThe emotions displayed by McDonald\u2019s friends during the trial have ranged.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nMalinowksi\u2019s demeanor appeared solemn and forthcoming as she talked about their friendship. Melissa Fuller, the other member of their coworking trio, smiled sadly as she recalled McDonald\u2019s bubbly personality. She squeezed the hand of McDonald\u2019s mother, Elizabeth, as she exited the courtroom Thursday.\n\nA common thread in trial testimony has been Lateshia Simpson\u2019s involvement in looking for McDonald the morning she went missing. Simpson wiped her eyes after the court played voicemails she left on McDonald\u2019s phone, begging her to call her back, worried about where she was. Simpson said they resurfaced emotions she felt more than two decades ago.\n\nBut Simpson also sparred with Holley\u2019s defense team when they questioned her statements to police.\n\nIt appears Simpson was the first to tell McDonald\u2019s family and friends about Megan\u2019s disappearance \u2014 even the friends she didn\u2019t know, like Fuller. Fuller said Simpson called, concerned about McDonald, on March 14, the day after she went missing. Shortly before Fuller and Malinowski reported McDonald missing to State Police, Simpson told Fuller that McDonald may have been with Holley the night she disappeared.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nSimpson, who now lives in Greenville with two of her children, said she and McDonald became friends while McDonald was dating her brother, Pauly. Simpson defended her brother\u2019s reputation, saying he was never abusive or violent with women. But she noted that Pauly and Megan would \u201cslap\u201d each other, and said sometimes Megan would \u201chit\u201d him first.\n\nAfter they broke up, Lateshia\u2019s friendship with McDonald grew stronger. She testified that McDonald told her Holley was indebted to her for a car she helped him buy, and that McDonald and Holley had argued about his repayment. Simpson said she had worried their conflict would \u201cescalate.\u201d\n\nSimpson\u2019s testimony became tense when the defense confronted her with notes from a 2019 interview with State Police Investigator Brad Natalizio, during which she allegedly told police that McDonald actually owed Holley money, not the other way around. But Simpson testified that she wouldn\u2019t have had a reason to say that. Simpson also admitted she could not identify Holley from a photo during that interview.\n\nAfter more tense back and forth, Simpson said, \u201cWhen Megan died, I kind of died with her.\u201d The words spilled out of her. She continued, saying that for years, she \u201cblocked\u201d out details of events surrounding her friend\u2019s death, but her memories started returning after the 2019 interview.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThose interviews, I wouldn\u2019t call them regular interviews,\u201d she testified. \u201cThey were basically putting all the words in my mouth.\u201d\n\nThe mysterious cars circling Kensington Manor\n\nThroughout the trial, witnesses have associated Holley with a \u201cpurplish\u201d Honda Civic hatchback. Lateshia Simpson also testified that she drove a maroon hatchback in 2003, but couldn\u2019t recall any other details about the vehicle.\n\nBut the description of the purplish hatchback matches a car that Dawn Gasca Young, a key eyewitness, saw driving through the Kensington Manor apartment complex alongside McDonald\u2019s car shortly after she was killed. In 2003, Young told police that she saw a light-colored car with a black stripe and a \u201cdark-colored\u201d hatchback playing loud music circling the complex. Young would later learn the light-colored car was McDonald\u2019s white Mercury Sable, which was abandoned at the complex around the time of her murder for reasons unknown.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIt appears the drivers of these cars could be connected to McDonald\u2019s murder since prosecutors have said she was killed in her car.\n\nYoung\u2019s statements to police have changed over time, from vague in 2003 to specific in a 2020 interview when she recalled what she saw to police.\n\nYoung testified Thursday that she saw the cars circling the complex while waiting for her boyfriend \u2014 now her husband \u2014 to come home from work. He was a State Police trooper. She said the loud music drew her attention because she thought it came from her boyfriend\u2019s car. They lived across the hall from the complex\u2019s management office and didn\u2019t want to cause a nuisance. During her testimony, Young recalled that a woman named Danielle Rzeczkowski worked in the management office. Rzeczkowski was Pauly Simpson\u2019s girlfriend in 2003, after he and Megan had broken up.\n\nA couple of days later, Young noticed a heavy police presence surrounding McDonald\u2019s car. She walked over and told officers what she had seen. According to her 2003 statement, which was referred to in the trial, Young told police she saw the cars during the predawn hours of Saturday, March 15, and that the dark-colored hatchback had tinted windows, which prevented her from seeing who was driving.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nBut in the 2020 interview with State Police investigators, Young described the driver of the dark-colored hatchback as a man wearing a sideways baseball cap. And before giving grand jury testimony in Holley\u2019s case, Young said it wasn\u2019t Saturday when she saw the cars \u2014 it was predawn on Friday, March 14. She testified it would\u2019ve been impossible for her to have seen them after midnight on a Saturday; she never stayed up that late those nights because she worked Saturday mornings with her boyfriend at a business they ran on the side.\n\nWhether Holley ever owned a purplish Honda Civic hatchback was questioned when Michael Russell, Holley\u2019s close friend of about 20 years, said he didn\u2019t remember him ever being associated with a vehicle like that.\n\nOn Monday, the trial will resume with testimony from one of the most significant witnesses in the case: Pauly Simpson.",

He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nAsked how he felt about missing McDonald's wake and funeral, Simpson said, \"Not good. I should have been there. But everybody thought it was me (who killed her) at that time. I didn't want to cause her family more harm.\"\n\n\"Were you ever arrested for that?\" special prosecutor Julia Cornachio asked him.\n\n\"No,\" he said simply.\n\nProsecutors argued in opening statements McDonald\u2019s death was the result of Holley\u2019s rage against his ex-girlfriend.\n\nA cigar butt was found in the ashtray of McDonald\u2019s blood-stained Mercury Sable, with a mixture of DNA from McDonald and Simpson. DNA from McDonald and Holley was found on her cell phone.\n\nDefense attorney Paul Weber has argued investigators downplayed existing evidence when they became \u201claser-focused\u201d on Holley as a suspect and cautioned jurors of a \u201csmokescreen\u201d of prosecution witnesses.\n\nSimpson admitted his and McDonald's relationship wasn't perfect.\n\n\"It was good at times, but we had arguments and fights,\" Simpson said. \"I hit her, she hit me.\"\n\nPressed by Cornachio, Simpson clarified that by hitting, he meant open-fisted smacks, but he said they did not leave marks. In the end, they decided to separate as boyfriend and girlfriend, but to remain friends.\n\n\"She was seeing other people, I was seeing other people,\" Simpson said.\n\nSimpson said he always cooperated with the police who were investigating McDonald's death, even leaving a nightclub when he learned from his mother that a state police investigator was at their home looking for him.\n\n\"I had nothing to hide,\" he said.\n\nHospital assault: Garnet psychiatrist punched, knocked to ground. Monroe man charged with attempted murder\n\nBut on cross-examination, Weber questioned Simpson about his alleged history of encounters with the police, and receiving phone calls from alleged drug dealers and users.\n\nSimpson frequently either denied the allegations or said, \"I don't recall.\"\n\nWeber also asked Simpson about two calls McDonald made to him, once before and once just after visiting a bank the day before she died.\n\n\"How much money did Megan McDonald owe you on March 13, 2003?\" Weber asked Simpson.\n\n\"Zero,\" Simpson replied.\n\n\"Why did she call you again at 4:30?\" Weber pressed him.\n\n\"No clue,\" Simpson replied.\n\nWeber had not concluded his cross-examination of Simpson when the trial adjourned for the week on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe trial will resume this week and is expected to continue into April.\n\nHolley faces up to 25 years to life in state prison if he is convicted.\n\nMike Randall covers breaking news for the Times Herald-Record and the Poughkeepsie Journal.

            "content": "CNA Staff, Mar 21, 2025 / 06:00 am\n\nFew people associate McDonald\u2019s with the season of Lent, but the fast-food chain has played a small but iconic role in Lenten history \u2014 at least in the United States.\n\nKnown primarily for its burgers and chicken nuggets, the restaurant\u2019s \u201cFilet-o-Fish\u201d sandwich is also a classic mainstay on its menu \u2014 and it first arose in the early 1960s as a way to boost sales on Lenten Fridays.\n\nAccording to the company, Lou Groen, an early franchisee based in Cincinnati, ran a McDonald\u2019s in a heavily Catholic neighborhood and observed a decrease in sales at his McDonald\u2019s restaurant on Fridays during Lent. He proposed to founder Ray Kroc that he allow the restaurant to begin selling fish sandwiches as a way to draw in observant Catholics on Fridays.\n\nKroc was dubious about adding fish to the menu. Groen would later claim that Kroc told him: \u201cI don\u2019t want my stores stunk up with the smell of fish!\u201d\n\nHe and Groen decided to run a test: They\u2019d sell Groen\u2019s fish sandwich on a Friday alongside what Kroc dubbed the \u201cHula Burger\u201d \u2014 a meatless sandwich consisting of grilled pineapple with a slice of cheese on top.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the Filet-o-Fish won out. In fact, it won massively: In its corporate history McDonald\u2019s says the fish sandwich sold 350 orders, while only six customers purchased a \u201cHula Burger.\u201d\n\nA few years later, the fish sandwich was the first new dish officially added to the original McDonald\u2019s menu.\n\nThe company says it has since become a \u201cpopular menu item.\u201d At one point McDonald\u2019s even advertised the sandwich with an anthropomorphic, sharply dressed piece of cod known as \u201cPhil A. O\u2019Fish.\u201d\n\nTrending 1 2 3 4 5\n\nThe sandwich remains an indelible part of American fast food culture, though it appears to have fallen somewhat out of favor in recent years: AllRecipes earlier this year polled a group of chefs about the \u201cbest fast-food fish sandwich,\u201d and the Filet-o-Fish ranked 10 out of 11. Earlier this month, meanwhile, Taste of Home ranked the Filet-o-Fish at the bottom of its list of fast-food fishwiches.\n\nStill, due to its legendary roots, the Filet-o-Fish\u2019s place in both fast-food and Catholic history is assured. Kroc himself must have been aware of its looming historicity in the early 1960s: McDonald\u2019s says that he was so sure of the success of his Hula Burger that he \u201cmade a side bet with his first grillman Fred Turner that the loser would buy the winner a new suit.\u201d\n\n\u201cFred got a new suit,\u201d company historian Mike Bullington said, \u201cand McDonald\u2019s got the Filet-O-Fish.\u201d",

Defendant Ridge was interviewed and later booked into the Harris County Jail.\"\n\nThe victim is identified as Jorge Arbaiza, who was shot multiple times while picking up Happy Meals for his grandchildren.\n\n\u00d7 Expand GoFundMe Jorge Arbaiza, top left, with his wife and grand children.\n\nInnocent Bystander Caught in Teenage Dispute\n\nThe incident occurred around 5:30 p.m. Sheriff Ed Gonzalez says the shooting stemmed from an altercation between \"two groups of teenagers\" that quickly escalated to gunfire. Arbaiza, who was inside the restaurant ordering food for his grandchildren, became an innocent victim of the violence. His wife of 39 years, Teresa Arbaiza, was waiting in the parking lot with their grandchildren when the shooting occurred.\n\n\"When people started running out of the restaurant and I didn't see my husband, I called him,\" Teresa told Houston television station KHOU. \"He told me, 'I'm dying. I'm going to die.'\"\n\nDespite being life-flighted to the Texas Medical Center in Houston for emergency surgery, Arbaiza succumbed to his wounds.\n\nA Go Fund Me page has been set up by the Abriza family.\n\n\"The abrupt departure of our father leaves my mother alone, and this GoFundMe is intended to help cover the funeral expenses and provide my mother any additional funds as she navigates this tumultuous time,\" the post says.\n\nRead our original story about this case.\n\nMultiple Victims and Suspects\n\nA 25-year-old man was also struck during the shooting.

One group reportedly left in a maroon SUV, while the other group escaped in a white sedan. The Sheriff's Office described all suspects as appearing to be between 16 and 20 years old.\n\nDetectives are reviewing surveillance footage as part of their ongoing investigation into the shooting. Anyone with information about the incident or the suspects involved is encouraged to contact the Harris County Sheriff's Office at 713-221-6000 or Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS.",

When you're traveling somewhere new or scrambling to get something in your stomach before the long work day ahead, McDonald's always serves as a convenient and relatively inexpensive option. One of its most iconic offerings on its breakfast menu is the simple Egg McMuffin. Before the newfangled McMuffin variations, including ones made with bacon and sausage, there was the OG Egg McMuffin. And before that, there was Herb Peterson.\n\nHerb Peterson is the individual credited with coming up with the Egg McMuffin in his Santa Barbara McDonald's in the '70s. The breakfast sandwich he created has grown to an international offering and sparked the development of other delicious breakfast favorites. While Peterson's creation is very well-known across the world, his story is something kept a little closer to the chest. We had an opportunity to speak to Herb's son, David Peterson \u2014 author of \"The Good Egg\" \u2014 about how his father's invention 50 years ago changed not only his dad's life, and by extension, his own, but also transformed McDonald's breakfast menu as we know it.",

Next up for the foundation will be its two biggest fundraisers of the year - its indoor Pond Hockey Tournament at Princeton Day School and a Celebrity Golf Outing at The Ridge at Back Brook, New Jersey.

Her freshman year in 2020-21 was wiped away by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bulldogs have never made the NCAA tournament. Ivy League rules require players to complete their four years of eligibility in four years, so McDonald entered the transfer portal looking for a place to finish her wanted to earn a master\u2019s degree in public health and prioritized those programs as much as athletic ones.\n\nHer mother worked as a nurse at Boston Medical Center, where McDonald often volunteered with her older sister Alanna and twin sister Cara. Both sisters are nurses now.\n\n\u201cBeing a safety net hospital that serves sort of under privileged communities really inspired me to work in that field,\u201d Brenna McDonald said. \u201cI didn't necessarily want to do the patient-facing side of things, but I knew I wanted to be more in that planning administrative role.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s School of Public Health ranked No. 5 in the world on the Global Ranking of Academic Subjects list in 2023, so McDonald was intrigued when Huskies coach Tina Langley reached out despite Washington\u2019s distance from home. McDonald was used to her parents being able to drive two hours to watch her play or a short trip if she wanted to visit Natick.\n\nHer visit to Seattle made it obvious. She met the team and saw the facilities.\n\n\u201cI was pretty much sold,\u201d McDonald said.\n\nThe differences from the Ivy League became apparent immediately when McDonald stepped onto campus for the summer session. That period doesn\u2019t exist in the Ivy League.\n\n\u201cIt was almost an advantage for me because I was able to come to campus in the summer and start working out with everyone getting acclimated to the campus into the city of Seattle,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cMy parents were able to come with me sort of settle me in before school started. I started getting a feel for their coaching style for my teammates and everything, and I think that made it a smoother transition into when school started.\u201d\n\nShe already knew how to balance being an athlete with academic rigor, but Washington\u2019s move to the Big Ten complicated the process. Bus rides to Princeton, Colombia and Harvard don\u2019t tax a body or mind the same as flights to Southern California, the Midwest and as far as Rutgers, occasionally in the middle of the week.\n\n\u201cThe program that I'm in has been very accommodating with all of our travel and everything as far as sending you recordings of lectures and getting the assignments,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cAnd when I am able to be there, I've never felt behind because of how helpful they've been with that and because of the way that our coaches give us free time so that we can do all of our homework and meet all of our needs outside of just basketball.\u201d\n\nBest of the best: How D-S grad Hope Shue became national player of the year for Middlebury women's lacrosse\n\nOn the floor, she has appeared in 28 games for Washington and is averaging 1.8 points per game ahead of Thursday\u2019s First Four game in Raleigh against Columbia . McDonald views her role as a guiding presence for her teammates. She reinforces Washington\u2019s culture of humility and putting others before yourself in a practical way by priding herself on the screens she sets and the way she fights for rebounds.\n\nMarch Madness connections: These NCAA tournament basketball players are from MetroWest\n\n\u201cI've played almost every role there is to play on a college basketball team at this point, so I think just being that uplifting force for my teammates, bringing people together,\u201d McDonald said.\n\nShe will likely make her NCAA Tournament debut against a familiar foe in the Lions. McDonald left the Ivy League for this kind of chance.\n\n\u201cI'm extremely grateful to be in a position that I am in to have been recruited by university of Washington because I couldn't have asked for a better last year of college basketball,\u201d she said. \u201c I wouldn't be in this position without the sacrifices that other people had made for me and without the immense amount of belief from people like my parents and my siblings. If they hadn't been encouraging me throughout my whole basketball career, if my college coaches hadn't believed me, if my high school coaches hadn't had believed me, I wouldn't be in this position. It just always takes a village, and it's never never one person doing it on their own to get to this point.\u201d\n\nContact Kyle Grabowski at kgrabowski@gannett.com.

He was life-flighted to a nearby hospital but later died from his wounds, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, Teresa Abaiza, Jorge's wife, was inside a vehicle in the McDonald's parking lot with two of their grandchildren. Jorge had run inside to grab the grandchildren Happy Meals, Teresa told Houston television station KHOU.\n\nWhen Teresa spotted people from inside the restaurant running outside, but didn't see her husband, Teresa called him. That was when she learned he had been shot.\n\n\"'I'm dying. I'm going to die,'\" Teresa told KHOU her husband of 39 years said to her.\n\nHarris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in a social media post over the weekend that it appears two parties began fist-fighting in the McDonald's when at least two guns were pulled out and shots were fired. Several customers were inside the restaurant during the time of the shooting, including children. A 26-year-old man was also shot during the shooting but survived, Gonzalez added.\n\nAs of Wednesday, Harris County Sheriff's Office Violent Crime Detectives, Homicide Detective and Crime Scene Detectives were continuing to investigate the shooting. Multiple security cameras helped the detectives identify a suspected vehicle and several people involved in the altercation, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThose with more information should contact the Harris County Sheriff's Office Homicide Office at 713-274-7100 or Crime Stoppers at 713-222-8477.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

            "content": "McDonald's (MCD) closed at $306.92 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.09% move from the prior day. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.08%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.92%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.41%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the world's biggest hamburger chain had lost 0.4% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 11.45% and the S&P 500's loss of 8.26% in that time.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of McDonald's will be of great interest to investors. In that report, analysts expect McDonald's to post earnings of $2.68 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 0.74%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $6.13 billion, down 0.55% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $12.23 per share and revenue of $26.37 billion, which would represent changes of +4.35% and +1.74%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for McDonald's. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.23% lower. As of now, McDonald's holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, McDonald's is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 24.83. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 23.14 of its industry.\n\nWe can also see that MCD currently has a PEG ratio of 3.11. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Retail - Restaurants industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.08.\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 142, placing it within the bottom 44% of over 250 industries.",

            "content": "McDonald\u2019s is undertaking one of its most significant structural shifts in recent memory, with a clear mandate: move faster and decentralize hospitality systems decision making and deployment. Under the leadership of CEO Chris Kempczinski, the company is reorganizing its operations, supply chain, development, and innovation teams to cut through bureaucracy and bring new products and technologies to market faster.\n\nHospitality is Changing at a Rapid Clip\n\nThis move comes at a critical time. The fast-food giant is facing a sluggish environment. Global same-store sales plateaued in 2024 after years of growth, signaling saturation and consumer fatigue. Overall U.S. restaurant traffic declined by 2.8% in the same period and is expected to drop again, indicating larger macroeconomic pressures. Consumers are increasingly price-sensitive, questioning the value proposition of fast food amid inflationary pressures and shifting dining habits. McDonald\u2019s also faces increased competition from fast-casual brands and delivery-focused digital players. The stakes are high as McDonald\u2019s aims to reach 50,000 restaurants by 2027, up from 43,500 today\u2014a bold target that will require not just scale, but sustained customer loyalty and operational excellence.\n\nLeading Operators Are Reinventing Agile Org Charts\n\nAt the heart of this transformation is the creation of a new Chief Restaurant Experience Officer role, to be filled by Jill McDonald. Her remit is expansive, overseeing operations, supply chain, franchising, development, design, delivery, and innovation. This centralization is designed to eliminate inefficiencies that arise from departmental silos, enabling the company to pivot quickly when market dynamics shift. Importantly, she will also manage category leads for beef, chicken, and beverages\u2014ensuring that product innovation aligns with consumer demand and operational realities. This direct line of sight between category strategy and restaurant execution represents a fundamental shift in how McDonald\u2019s approaches product lifecycle management.\n\nHospitality Tech Stack Optimization Comes into Focus\n\nKempczinski has been candid about the need for speed and operator-first thinking. He pointed to the company\u2019s seven-year process to improve its core burgers as evidence that McDonald\u2019s can no longer afford slow innovation cycles. This acknowledgment is a clear pivot from legacy processes to agile development methodologies and hospitality tech stack optimization at the unit level. In his words, this new structure is about ensuring one person views all new technology and menu initiatives through the eyes of a restaurant general manager. The implications are profound: products and technologies will now be designed with usability, training, and immediate impact in mind, reducing friction for franchisees and staff.\n\nThis approach mirrors what the hospitality industry has experienced with the deployment of technologies that are only successful if they integrate seamlessly into operations. Examples include dynamic pricing tools, which allow restaurant menus to adjust pricing based on demand, events, or seasonality \u2014 helping operators maximize revenue without alienating customers. Self check-in kiosks have reduced wait times, improved guest satisfaction, and lowered operational costs, provided they are intuitive and do not disrupt existing workflows. Delivery channel managers help streamline third-party delivery orders, consolidating them into a single operational flow and reducing manual errors in the same way that hotel channel managers distribute rates, availability and inventory to online travel agencies. For McDonald\u2019s, adopting this operator-first mindset means future technology deployments, whether AI-driven drive-thru systems or digital menu boards, must be practical, reduce operational complexity, and deliver measurable improvements in efficiency and guest satisfaction.\n\nLessons for the Hospitality Industry\n\nThe strategic lesson for the broader restaurant industry is clear. Innovation efforts that do not factor in operational complexity and frontline execution are destined to fall short. It is not enough to roll out new digital experiences or menu items if the store teams are unprepared or if the supply chain cannot support them. Companies need to rethink their innovation processes, moving from boardroom ideation to field-level co-creation. This approach fosters stronger franchisee relationships, higher adoption rates, and ultimately better customer experiences.\n\nBorrowing from Consumer Packaged Goods\n\nThis realignment also takes cues from the consumer packaged goods world, where speed to market and tight alignment between product development and distribution are critical. McDonald\u2019s now applies this mindset to foodservice, acknowledging that today\u2019s consumers are not just looking for novelty but also convenience, reliability, and value. By adopting CPG-style portfolio management, McDonald\u2019s can make faster decisions on when to launch, iterate, or sunset products, ensuring that only the most resonant items remain on menus.\n\nAnother noteworthy aspect of this shift is the emphasis on category ownership. Having dedicated leaders for beverages and desserts, for example, allows McDonald\u2019s to close gaps where customers might visit competitors for specific products. By addressing these blind spots, the company aims to grow market share in key categories like beef, chicken, and coffee. This focus on category leadership also facilitates better supplier relationships, faster product testing, and the ability to respond to localized market trends with more agility.\n\nImplications for Hospitality Executives\n\nThe implications for restaurant executives are profound. Top-down tech rollouts or menu decisions made in corporate isolation are no longer sustainable. Instead, organizations must build cross-functional teams that integrate operations, supply chain, and consumer insights. Success in the current climate requires agility and alignment. Executives should consider whether they have dedicated leadership for each major product category and whether those leaders have the autonomy to act quickly. Additionally, empowering franchise operators and frontline managers to provide feedback and influence strategic decisions can lead to more successful deployments and stronger brand loyalty.\n\nIf even McDonald\u2019s, with its scale and resources, has recognized the need for structural change to keep pace, every restaurant brand should be reevaluating its org chart. Do you have the right people in place to translate strategy into frontline execution? Are you empowering store-level leaders to inform innovation? And are you moving quickly enough to stay ahead in an industry where consumer behavior is shifting faster than ever? McDonald\u2019s new structure is more than a reorganization. It is a call to action for the industry: align innovation with real-world operations, accelerate decision-making, and put operators at the center of strategy. Brands that can\u2019t move with this level of clarity and speed risk falling behind in an increasingly unforgiving market.\n\nJordan Hollander is the co-founder of HotelTechReport, the hotel industry\u2019s app store where millions of professionals discover tech tools to transform their businesses.

Patrick Oehler, Times Herald-Record\n\nEdward Holley has been accused of murder in the 2003 death of Megan McDonald.\n\nIn the first week of proceedings, prosecutors spent time outlining the circumstances around the discovery of McDonald's body.\n\nThe trial is expected to last several weeks.\n\nProsecutors in the Edward Holley murder trial spent extensive time during the first week laying out the circumstances around the discovery of Megan McDonald's body.\n\nHolley, a former boyfriend of McDonald, is accused of murdering her in March 2003. He has pleaded not guilty to a charge of second-degree murder.\n\nThe jury was shown numerous photos of McDonald's white Mercury Sable, which was found at Kensington Manor in the Scotchtown area of the town of Wallkill \u2014 470 feet from where Holley lived at the time \u2014 on March 14, 2003.\n\nRetired New York State Police investigators Timothy Zeszutek and Joseph Barrett walked prosecutors through those photos, which showed numerous blood stains on the inside and outside of the car, including on the driver's seatbelt, which was hanging out the closed door.\n\nBarrett said no usable latent fingerprints were found on the car. A cigar butt was found in the ashtray with a mixture of DNA from McDonald and Paul Simpson, who was previously in a relationship with her.\n\nDavid Voelker, a resident of Kensington Manor who saw the Sable parked there while walking his dog on the morning of March 14, called its presence suspicious.\n\nProsecutors and investigators believe McDonald was killed sometime in the early morning hours of March 14, although her body was not discovered in a field off Bowser Road in Wallkill until March 15.\n\nBarrett said he was assigned to go to that location around 3 p.m. on March 15. Around 10 p.m., he went to McDonald's residence, in a basement apartment of a ranch house on Karen Drive, to see if it might be a crime scene. It was not.\n\nOne of the last things McDonald was known to have done was make a deposit at the HSBC on Route 211 in Middletown. Jurors were shown surveillance camera images from just after 3:30 p.m. on March 13.\n\nRepresentatives from Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile and Frontier Communications testified to the authenticity of phone records that the Orange County District Attorney's office had subpoenaed at the time of McDonald's murder. Those records are no longer in those company's computer systems, as such records are usually purged after a year or two.\n\nDOT study: NY may consider safety improvements at Rosendale intersection where pedestrian was killed\n\nThe relationship of those phone records to the case was not explained at the time of their testimony.\n\nIn opening statements, Laura Murphy, one of two special prosecutors, recounted how McDonald was found with multiple fractures to the back of her head, bleeding from the brain, a fractured jaw, multiple bruises on her body, a chipped tooth and broken fingernails.\n\nShe said Holley has told false stories to police of his whereabouts during the time McDonald disappeared and was being murdered. She told the jury the prosecution's case will convince them to find Holley guilty of murder.\n\nLead defense attorney Paul Weber, however, told jurors not to \"fall for the parade\" of witnesses the prosecution will call, and urged them to judge evidence based on quality, not quantity.\n\nWeber said state police did not become focused on Holley until 2017, while rejecting other suspects. He claimed state police to this day are still trying to get evidence against Holley.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to continue in Orange County Court for several weeks.\n\nMike Randall covers breaking news for the Times Herald-Record and the Poughkeepsie Journal.

            "content": "\n\nUtah GCSA members during a past spring service project.\n\nFor Karen Skidmore, the eyes have it.\n\nEverything that goes on inside the facility where she is employed at East South Temple Road is important. When she looks outside, though, a group of people who come there each year provides a visually appealing effort every visit.\n\nIt\u2019s happening again this year. Members from the Utah GCSA are planning to make the trek to the Ronald McDonald House Charities Intermountain Area in downtown Salt Lake City in April for the chapter\u2019s spring service project to accomplish myriad chores, from painting to planting things such as tomatoes, peppers and squash.\n\nSkidmore can\u2019t wait for the 2025 edition.\n\n\u201cThey come, all day long, bring their families, knocking out everything we need,\u201d says Skidmore, project manager at the RMHC. \u201cThey\u2019re hard workers. They just knock it out.\u201d\n\nRMHC of the Intermountain Area surrounds families with the support they need to be near and care for their seriously ill or injured children. RMHC provides a home-away-from-home to ease daily burdens and empower families of hospitalized children with meaningful experiences and quality time together. RMHC strives to provide exceptional programs with fiscal responsibility, accountability and compassionate thoughtfulness.\n\nUtah GCSA\u2019s mission statement is: \u201cDedicated to improving the superintendents\u2019 position in the golf industry through education, networking, advocacy, and to grow the game of golf.\u201d What the chapter does outside of its member golf courses is inspiring to chapter executive Allie Schneiter.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re awesome. They take their time away from work, family, to participate, willing to help one another, and they all look out for each other,\u201d Schneiter says.\n\nWhen Schneiter\u2019s predecessor, Natalie Barker, oversaw the Utah GCSA, a union with RMHC was established. It was a no-brainer for the chapter to pursue. \u201cThese kinds of programs are vital, important for us to get involved,\u201d Barker says. \u201cIt was like, \u2018We\u2019ve got experience on the ground, so let\u2019s get involved.\u2019 These families go through so much, and it\u2019s very eye-opening to see what they go through. It\u2019s a neat experience to be part of what we do for the Ronald McDonald House.\u201d\n\nMore than a couple dozen Utah GCSA member superintendents arrive at RMHC with a daylong plan to do a bevy of tasks, including spreading mulch and painting fences. RMHC purchased the tools they need, including everything from seed to wheelbarrows.\n\nJohn Hansgen, CGCS, is known to bring multiple members of his crew with him. \u201cI try to take as many guys as I can for whatever it is we\u2019re doing,\u201d says Hansgen, a 22-year GCSAA member who oversees Fox Hollow Golf Course in American Fork, Utah. \u201cRonald McDonald House has amazing services for families. It\u2019s good to support something like that and show off the skills our members have, how efficient, hard-working and organized our people are. These kids at Ronald McDonald House go through hard times. For all of us to spruce up that facility and make that one block look so much better is what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nUtah GCSA member Eric Gifford and his wife, Olga, have special places in their hearts for RMHC. Several years ago, they stayed at Primary Children\u2019s Hospital in an RMHC-sponsored room for their son there in Salt Lake City. The Giffords stayed there for two weeks at PCH\u2019s cardiac ICU for parents. Today, the Giffords volunteer or donate whenever they can for RMHC in Salt Lake City.\n\n\u201cIt (RMHC rooms for parents) is a place that feels like home when you\u2019re away from home,\u201d says Gifford, a GCSAA Class A superintendent and 21-year association member who\u2019s in charge at Salt Lake Country Club in Salt Lake City. \u201cWhat Ronald McDonald House does means a lot.\u201d\n\nGifford actually had a say in the decision to connect Utah GCSA with RMHC when he was on the chapter board. \u201cWe (Utah GCSA) love being supporters,\u201d he says, \u201cand being part of what Ronald McDonald House does is personal for me.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the service project is a family affair for Utah GCSA. Superintendents have brought family members. Schneiter\u2019s daughter, Lindsey, participated. \u201cIt was a good experience for her. I want to teach her about giving back,\u201d says Schneiter, whose sons, Luke and Liam, also were there, \u201cand I think she really enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nSkidmore, meanwhile, is thankful for it. She even mentioned how Utah GCSA gets into the spirit for that day, like the time it made T-shirts specifically for the event. \u201cThey\u2019re amazing,\u201d Skidmore says. \u201cThey are appreciated, and we love what they can do.\u201d\n\nHoward Richman is GCM's managing editor",

(WNEM) \u2013 Congresswoman Kirsten McDonald Rivet announced she sent a letter to the General Service Administration (GSA) demanding clarity about the future of Saginaw\u2019s Social Security Administration office.\n\nMcDonald Rivet said on March 4, the GSA published a \u201cnon-core property list\u201d on its official website that listed properties that are for disposal, and the Saginaw Social Security Administration office was on the list. It was removed from the list on March 5, but the GSA didn\u2019t give any information about why it was initially listed or what the timeline of the property disposal would be, McDonald Rivet said.\n\nThe letter she sent on Monday, March 17 read in part:\n\nMy office frequently directs constituents experiencing difficulties to the Saginaw field office, because the staff are effective, and the in-person assistance is especially helpful for residents who are elderly or disabled. This threatened closure would create barriers for my constituents, limiting their access to timely and easily accessible support for their benefits. Every day, I hear from residents who are scared of losing their Social Security benefits due to the comments and actions made by this Administration. The GSA\u2019s haphazard actions have only amplified the panic and fear in my community, calling into question whether or not people will still be able to receive their benefits.\n\nFurthermore, my concerns are magnified by the Administration\u2019s rhetoric labeling the Social Security benefits program as a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d and a \u201cscam,\u201d along with proposals to restrict claims processing and direct-deposit bank account transactions over the phone. According to recent reports, elderly and disabled people would be directed to in-person field offices, yet those offices, like the one we have in Saginaw, are being targeted for disposal. These attempts to blatantly restrict access to benefits would cause harm to my constituents, many of whom cannot afford it.\n\nYou can find the full letter on McDonald Rivet\u2019s website.\n\nSubscribe to the TV5 newsletter and receive the latest local news and weather straight to your email every day.\n\nCopyright 2025 WNEM.

From the baked apple pies to luxurious strawberry shakes, there's a lot to savor on this menu too. To get an idea of which of this chain's sweet treats are worth a purchase, we ranked every McDonald's dessert. While the hot fudge sundae and classic vanilla cone performed well, the M&M McFlurry made the bottom of the list. Here's why.\n\nThis McFlurry is made up simply of McDonald's soft-serve ice cream and mini M&Ms. At face value, it's not a bad treat, but it's still far from perfect. The main problem with this McFlurry is the mix-ins. While mini M&Ms are fun to eat, they're not an ideal candy to put in a milkshake. Despite their small size, these M&Ms are still too big to be an add-on as they don't mix in effortlessly with the soft-serve ice cream. As a result, every sip of this McFlurry feels forced.\n\nThe chilled temperatures of this treat create a second problem with the M&Ms. While this candy melts perfectly in warm temperatures, making them a great secret ingredient for ridiculously good s'mores, the shells on M&Ms grow hard as they sit in soft serve, making the experience of actually enjoying this McFlurry even more difficult. Instead of savoring this treat, it's a race against time to suck it all down before the candy gets rock hard and ruins it.",

Some take it as their time to greet the day slowly with a cup of coffee and a simple meal of eggs, oatmeal, or toast. Others lean into extravagant brunch dishes to nourish and impress, like Roasted Tomato Quiche or Stuffed Ham-And-Cheese Croissant Casserole. (My Southern great-grandmother fell somewhere in the middle, preparing around five dozen buttermilk biscuits each morning to feed her family of seven.) Our breakfast traditions run the gamut.\n\nBut there is also an intersection where deliciousness meets convenience, and that\u2019s where you\u2019ll find one fan-favorite McDonald\u2019s menu item: the Bagel Sandwich.\n\nFirst introduced in 1999, McDonald\u2019s Bagel Sandwiches\u2014then, an egg plus protein of choice\u2014quickly gained fans for being a comprehensive breakfast on-the-go. According to New York Post, the global fast-food chain took standalone bagels off its breakfast menu in 2020.\n\nThe sandwiches were only available at participating McDonald\u2019s locations across the country, but had garnered a passionate base. In fact, fans went so far as to create a public spreadsheet of where Bagel Sandwiches could be found across the country.\n\nBut now, we have good news: For the first time ever, Bagel Sandwiches are available in every McDonald\u2019s restaurant in the United States. Seriously!\n\nMcDonald's McDonald's Steak, Egg & Cheese Bagel\n\nThe first breakfast sandwich option is the Bacon, Egg & Cheese Bagel with thick-cut Applewood smoked bacon, a fluffy folded egg, creamy breakfast sauce, and two slices of American cheese.\n\nThe second is a Steak, Egg & Cheese Bagel\u2014a juicy steak patty with a fluffy folded egg, American cheese, creamy breakfast sauce, and savory grilled onions.\n\nAnd finally, we can\u2019t forget about the classic Egg & Cheese Bagel\u2014fluffy egg, breakfast sauce, and American cheese. Of course, each and every bagel is toasted to golden perfection. McDonald's also confirmed that the Sausage, Egg & Cheese Bagel will be joining menus nationwide.\n\nThis announcement from McDonald\u2019s comes alongside the company\u2019s celebration of 50 years of the Egg McMuffin, their most popular breakfast menu item. There are a couple other breakfast perks you may not want to miss:\n\nEgg McMuffin Day: On Sunday, March 2, grab a classic Egg McMuffin or Sausage McMuffin with Egg through the McDonald\u2019s app for just $1.\n\nMcDelivery: From March 3-30, get a BOGO Sausage McMuffin with Egg when ordering delivery through the app.\n\n\u201cAt McDonald's, breakfast isn't just a meal; it's a cherished tradition and cornerstone of our brand,\u201d said McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger.\n\n\u201cEvery morning when we open our doors, we are a breakfast restaurant. Whether it\u2019s my personal favorite, the Egg McMuffin, or our crispy Hash Browns, fluffy hotcakes, or sweet and savory McGriddles, we\u2019re all about giving our customers the best start to their day. Our fans know they can always count on us for a one-of-a-kind breakfast experience, anchored in great value and high-quality ingredients.\u201d\n\nWhat an egg-cellent way to start your day!\n\nRead the original article on Southern Living",

They change out business models, swap ingredients, and create faster and more convenient ways to get food to the consumer. Undoubtedly, fast food evolution does create an abundance of new advantages. However, it also eradicates more nostalgia-inducing moments.\n\nFor many older folk, a particular golden era in fast food culture took place during the 1980s. Back then, the food was healthier, the offerings more focused, and the general atmosphere more relaxed. Hard to imagine that during that time, you were permitted to host a party at McDonald's on your birthday or order a super-size meal for the first time. So sure, perhaps right now is the most well-groomed, tech-enhanced fast food experience.

The vehicle is part of a partnership between the fast food giant and local charity Vibe UK.\n\nThe initiative, which started in January, hopes to support the young people of Northwood and Knowsley in building positive relationships with themselves and others. As part of it, it sees Vibe take a youth outreach bus to attend the County Road restaurant every Monday from 5 pm to 8 pm.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nArticle continues below\n\nInside the bus, there are several activities people can participate in, including game consoles, arts and crafts, sports, and board games. Vibe also provides sexual health services, including contraception and testing kits.\n\nSince Vibe\u2019s arrival with launching the Youth Bus at McDonald\u2019s, the charity has undertaken 33 hours of detached youth work through 11 sessions and engaged with over 140 young people, all through crucial funding from BBC Children in Need.\n\nPaul Oginsky, CEO of Vibe UK, said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s a safe space to chill, a place to get advice, or somewhere to play sports and socialise, the detached youth bus is always there to make a difference. By bringing people together, breaking down barriers, and offering young people real opportunities, a youth bus helps create a stronger, more connected community where everyone feels valued.\u201d\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThe bus is hoping to bring about positive change for the area. (Image: McDonalds )\n\nPaul explained how a youth outreach bus is an \u201camazing way\u201d to bring young people together, break down barriers, and create real connections in the community. He claimed that going to places where young people spend time makes them more accessible and inviting.\n\nDue to the success in Kirkby, the team at Vibe has also been awarded extra funding from Knowsley Council. They will be committed to offering the same service at another McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Knowsley, Page Moss.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nFranchisee, Mark Blundell, who owns and operates 22 restaurants in Liverpool, said: \u201cWith so many young people today not feeling properly supported by their community, we wanted to do something to help unlock genuine opportunity for the youth. It\u2019s truly inspiring to see Vibe youth workers engaging with both our customers and staff \u2014 building bonds and making a positive impact.\n\nThe bus has been parked outside the venue for weeks (Image: McDonalds )\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s is a space where everyone feels welcome, no matter their background, and helps build friendships between different groups. It also bridges the gap between generations by giving young people a chance to chat with older members of the community, breaking stereotypes and building respect.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019re creating meaningful moments and making a difference every day to the people of Liverpool and look forward to implementing this across other restaurants.\u201d\n\nThe partnership is part of the McDonald\u2019s Makin\u2019 It programme, run in collaboration with BBC Children in Need - to better support young people and unlock genuine opportunity. With youth unemployment at an all-time high, the partnership has the potential hopes to make a real impact on the lives of young people from Liverpool and surrounding areas.",

            "content": "HONG KONG--Chinese food and beverage brands are gaining ground across Southeast Asia, offering alternatives to big name American chains and expanding Beijing\u2019s commercial and cultural influence in neighboring economies.\n\nThe Chinese beverage giant Mixue Group has become the world\u2019s largest F&B chain by number of outlets, overtaking Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThe company, whose brand name Mixue Bingcheng means \u201cHoney Snow Ice City,\u201d in Chinese, is capitalizing on the region-wide sweet tooth with affordable offerings of ice cream, coffee and bubble tea drinks.\n\n\u201cEven on social media like TikTok and others, there is a joke that any empty shophouse would soon turn into a Mixue store,\u201d Rahma Yuliana said, referring to a popular saying in Indonesia, where Mixue has more than 2,600 outlets.\n\nThe single mother, who runs an online business, takes her daughter for afterschool treats that won't drain her wallet, such as a cup of brown sugar milk tea that costs $1.10, about one-third cheaper than similar offerings by rival Taiwanese tea chain Chatime. An ice cream sells for as little as 50 cents, undercutting McDonald\u2019s.\n\nAs of September, Mixue Group had over 45,000 stores carrying its Mixue tea drinks, ice creams and Lucky Cup coffee products, more than the store numbers of Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s, industry analysts reported. About 40,000 of those are in China.\n\nMore broadly, by December, Chinese F&B brands had opened over 6,100 outlets in Southeast Asia, Singapore-headquartered research firm Momentum Works reported. India and Vietnam account for roughly two-thirds, while there are relatively more Chinese brands in Singapore and Malaysia, which have sizable Chinese-speaking populations.\n\nNearly all of Mixue's stores are franchises that the company supplies with ingredients for drinks like Creamy Mango Boba, Mango Oats Jasmine Tea and Coconut Jelly Milk Tea.\n\nApart from Mixue, other market stars include hotpot giant Haidilao, Fish With You sauerkraut fish restaurants, and well-known beverage brands such as Luckin Coffee, Heytea and Chagee.\n\nMixue's shares have doubled from their IPO price since their March 3 trading debut in Hong Kong.\n\nMomentum Works CEO Jianggan Li said Chinese businesses are actively seeking new growth in Southeast Asia after facing fierce competition in their home market.\n\nThe push by food and drink retailers has raised awareness that China has more to offer than just cheap electronics.\n\nThe companies are well-equipped, using automation to enhance their efficiency, and adept at online marketing, Li said. Big Western brands sometimes take a long time to find local partners and develop long-term plans. The Chinese F&B companies are \u201cmuch more impatient,\" he said.\n\nIn Thailand\u2019s capital Bangkok, Chinese entrepreneur Siya Han has invested over $1.37 million in 12 Mixue stores and about 10 other outlets selling spicy broth bowls, sauerkraut fish and fried chicken steaks in about six years. Outlets in shopping malls take time to recover costs due to huge rent deposits, she said, but her other outlets typically break even within six months to a year, excluding their lease guarantees.\n\n\u201cIf you open Chinese restaurants slowly, you can't survive,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, Chinese sauerkraut fish chain Fish With You vice president Liu Liujun also spotted opportunity in Southeast Asia\u2019s large ethnic Chinese population and growing economies.\n\nThe brand\u2019s $235,000 investment in one of its Malaysian outlets paid off in just nine months, with lines out the door almost daily, said Liu, who oversees the company's overseas expansion across the region.\n\nA customer, Victoria Kovalan said the new Chinese brands made it easier for her to try new cuisines. \u201cIt\u2019s opened up our palates,\u201d she said, referring to the popularity of Sichuan hotpots, known for their spicy flavors.\n\nVietnamese student Nguyen Thu Ho\u00e0i in Hanoi initially was skeptical about Mixue as a Chinese brand but has become a regular customer, she said, won over by its affordability and better-than-expected quality.\n\nThe expansion of Chinese food and beverage brands is part of a broader trend where Chinese goods are no longer seen as merely cheap but as having real value, said Gordon Mathews, a professor of anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nRecalling the cultural influence from McDonald\u2019s global expansion, Mathews said he visited its first outlet in southern China\u2019s economic hub of Guangzhou in the 1990s, where a clerk told him, \u201cI want to go to America.\u201d\n\nIf Chinese food brands exploded worldwide, they might have that influence, though the impact remains to be seen, he said.\n\n\u201cChina does have an uphill struggle to obtain soft power, but it\u2019s doing an excellent job with its products,\u201d he said.",

I had a lovely time meeting him,\u201d he added of the Kansas City Chiefs tight end. \u201cI\u2019m a fan \u2014 although his team keeps beating my Buffalo Bills. Josh Allen? Now that\u2019s a rockstar quarterback right there.\u201d\n\nEverything to Know About \u2018Happy Gilmore 2\u2019: Cast, Release Date and More\n\nAlthough Allen, 28, will not be sharing the big screen with Kelce, the NFL player is gearing up to marry Hailee Steinfeld. While McDonald assured fans that he doesn\u2019t follow his favorite players\u2019 relationships, he can\u2019t help but support Allen\u2019s love story.\n\n\u201cThe way they look at each other? Oh my god, that is love right there,\u201d he said at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. \u201cThey're gonna be just fine, those two. They're gonna have beautiful kids too, because they're two beautiful people inside and out. I don't know her that well, but I just love him, and I hope we have many more years of Josh Allen. MVP, baby.\u201d\n\nTiffany Rose/Getty Images for GBK Brand Bar\n\nWhile McDonald is excited to see the Bills win big next season, he\u2019s also pumped to have fans experience Happy Gilmore 2. In December 2024, Netflix released the very first sneak peek of the sequel.\n\nTwo months later, the streaming service shared a behind-the-scenes clip confirming several golfing stars would make appearances in the upcoming sequel.\n\n\u201cI think there's a great connection between both films,\u201d McDonald teased. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to watch the first one because then you'll follow the storyline, which is deeper and just funnier than you could imagine. I laughed out loud about 15 times during the read-through. It's so good, and I hope it holds up and people come in droves here. I think they will.\u201d\n\nBreaking Down Travis Kelce\u2019s Career Moves Off the Football Field: Movies, TV and More\n\nMcDonald is also looking forward to honoring the Happy Gilmore cast who passed away before the sequel is released. In February, news broke that Carl Weathers \u2014 who played Chubbs in the original 1996 film \u2014 had died at the age of 76.\n\n\u201cWe lost a handful of them and it's tragic, but we send them love in the movie,\u201d McDonald teased. \u201cI can't talk about it, but you'll see how we talk about them in the movie. \u2026 A lot of different people that aren't with us anymore, we're celebrating.\u201d\n\nHappy Gilmore tentatively hits Netflix on Friday, July 25.",

The company is creating a Restaurant Experience Team that will bring together operations, supply chain, franchising, development, design, delivery and innovation departments. With this restructuring, McDonald\u2019s is establishing three new global category management teams focused on beef, chicken and beverages/desserts.\n\n\u201cThis is really an evolution from our Customer Experience Team that we put in place about three years ago now,\u201d explained Chris Kempczinski, president, chief executive officer and chairman of McDonald\u2019s, in a video announcing the restructuring.\n\nDue to the nature of the quick-service restaurant industry, McDonald\u2019s is often competing against operators with expertise in a specific food category. In order to gain market share faster, the company is rethinking where its focus lies.\n\n\u201cThe thinking behind this (move) is, in so many of our categories, we\u2019re competing against specialists \u2014 we\u2019re competing against somebody like a KFC, for example, who is single-mindedly devoted to winning in chicken,\u201d Kempczinski said. \u201cSo this category team now allows us to actually have that same level of focus on do we have what we need \u2014 the winning strategies to win in chicken, to win in beverages, to continue to win in beef.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s announcement to fast-track market share aligns with its initiatives laid out in last month's earnings report. While softer, declining restaurant industry traffic in the United States and many other larger markets is expected in 2025, McDonald\u2019s maintains a robust financial strategy, looking to accelerate its digital footprint, share across its core menu and new restaurant rate.\n\nPersonnel updates\n\nEach of the three new global category management teams will have its own lead. Charlie Newberger was named lead of beverage/dessert category management, while the beef and chicken category leads have not been announced.\n\nSeveral other appointments were announced with this organizational shift. For one, Jill McDonald, current president of International Operated Markets (IOM), was appointed to the newly created role of chief restaurant experience officer, effective May 1. McDonald will also resume the responsibility of McDonald\u2019s Restaurant Platform lead, working closely with the technology team.\n\n\u201cJill\u2019s accomplishments with McDonald\u2019s span a variety of roles and responsibilities,\u201d Kempczinski said. \u201cHer demonstrated success and focus on our key business metrics have helped unlock growth opportunities in IOM. I\u2019m confident Jill is ready to embrace this new challenge and lead this dynamic team.\u201d\n\nSucceeding McDonald as president of IOM is Manu Steijaert, who most recently led McDonald\u2019s Customer Experience Team.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s created a second new position with its restructure \u2014 the global chief restaurant officer, who will oversee operations strategy and performance, restaurant innovation, and talent development. McDonald\u2019s has yet to announce who will fill this role.\n\nThe following appointments were also announced: Warren Anderson as global supply chain lead; Andrew Gregory in an expanded role leading global franchising, development and delivery; and Tabassum Zalotrawala as global restaurant design lead in addition to her current responsibilities overseeing US development.",

Let\u2019s take a look at how it plans to do that.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Wants To Get Things to Market Quickly\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the Wall Street Journal, McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski claimed that the burger company is shaking up its operations and development teams to get new menu items and technology to locations faster. Recent efforts to produce new sandwiches, including a years-long process to enhance McDonald\u2019s famous burgers, have taken far too long.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is attempting to regain traction in a challenging market for fast-food franchises. Consumers are dissatisfied, and some have started to regard fast food as overly pricey. Numerous restaurant businesses have expressed low financial forecasts for this year, citing concerned customers and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\nKempczinski, who has led the world\u2019s largest fast-food chain by sales since 2019, said McDonald\u2019s strategic objectives emphasize greater agility, but the business needs to speed up the deployment of new goods and technology to restaurants and enhance store coordination.\n\nJill McDonald will be the chain\u2019s first chief restaurant experience officer under the new structure, effective May 1. McDonald presently leads the company\u2019s worldwide division, which encompasses Europe, Canada, and Australia.\n\n\u201cI wanted one person who\u2019s actually looking at all these tech things through the eyes of the restaurant general manager,\u201d Kempczinski said. \u201cWe just need to make sure that our menu offering doesn\u2019t give somebody a reason why they come to us for their food and they maybe go to the place next door to go get the beverage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMcDonald\u2019s also plans to expand to 50,000 locations by 2027, up from a current 43,500 restaurants. Kempczinski expressed hope that the new innovation structure will help McDonald\u2019s gain market share in the coming year, notably in beef, chicken, and coffee.\n\nThe Controversial Grimace Tumbler\n\nWhile the fast-food giant is still struggling to attract new and returning customers following an E. coli outbreak last year, it received some positive press in February for its controversial but beloved Grimace tumbler.\n\nThe controversy arose, however, when U.S. customers were disappointed to learn that McDonald\u2019s had launched the new product exclusively in Australia.\n\nThe limited-edition Grimace Tumbler is a purple insulated cup with a yellow cover bearing the popular character\u2019s visage. McDonald\u2019s Australia also noted that it is \u201ca 1.18L stainless steel tumbler that is double wall vacuum insulated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect accessory \u2014 keeping drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 6 hours,\u201d the website wrote at the time, adding that all sales would benefit Ronald McDonald House Charities Australia.\n\nAs evidenced by the comments on a Facebook post, American admirers of the purple monster were extremely unhappy when they discovered they couldn\u2019t get their hands on one of the cups.\n\n\u201cThese are only available in Australia, and I\u2019m honestly so deeply saddened,\u201d one commented.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the U.S., and if I can\u2019t get my hands on this I\u2019m throwing a fit!!\u201d a different fan wrote.\n\n\u201cDear McDonald\u2019s, stop showing us cool stuff like this if we are unable to get it. It really just makes us dislike you,\u201d another upset customer stated.\n\nGrimace is one of McDonald\u2019s most popular pantheon figures. Most recently, he and his long-lost uncle, Uncle O\u2019Grimacey (who was initially featured in a marketing campaign in the 1970s), announced the reintroduction of the iconic Shamrock Shake.\n\nA press release stated, \u201cThis Shamrock Season celebration came to life when Grimace stumbled upon his family\u2019s original Shamrock Shake recipe. That discovery sparked Grimace to reconnect with his vibrant, joyful, and generous uncle, Uncle O\u2019Grimacey.\u201d",

Taco Bell's $7 Luxe Cravings Box: Chalupa Supreme\n\nBeefy Five-Layer Burrito\n\nDouble Stacked Taco\n\nChips and nacho cheese sauce\n\nMedium drink McDonald's $5 Meal Deal: McDouble or McChicken sandwich\n\nFour-piece Chicken McNuggets\n\nSmall fries\n\nSmall soft drink Wendy's $5 Biggie Bag: Junior Bacon Cheeseburger or Crispy Chicken Sandwich\n\nFour-piece chicken nuggets\n\nJunior fries\n\nSmall soft drink Burger King's $5 Your Way Meal: Whopper Junior, Chicken Junior, or Bacon Cheeseburger\n\nFries\n\nFour-piece chicken nuggets\n\nSoft drink\n\n\"If we can proactively address those issues before they occur, that's going to mean smoother operations in the future,\" Rice told WSJ.\n\nAI TAKEOVER\n\nAI in the drive-thru is also moving forward, similar to recent decisions from competitors like Wendy's.\n\nMcDonald's has had voice-activated drive-thru tech since 2019 through International Business Machines, but ended its partnership last year.\n\nThe fast food giant even seeks to use AI to assist staff as a \"generative AI virtual manager,\" per Rice.\n\nThat way the AI can make scheduling changes and select administrative decisions for managers, freeing them up to handle other responsibilities.\n\nCustomers could also start directly experiencing the impact of the AI updates at McDonald's soon through the mobile app.\n\nRice said McDonald's is tailoring promotional offers through AI's analysis of previous purchase history and even considering the weather.\n\n\"A customer who we know loves our sweet treats could get an offer through the app for a McFlurry on a hot summer day,\" he said.\n\nMcDonald's hasn't disclosed how much the tech updates cost.\n\nCEO Chris Kempczinski also recently confirmed the creation of a new team at the fast food giant that's \"devoted\" to taking on rivals like KFC.\n\nA customer also blasted McDonald's for an alleged 40-minute drive-thru wait, but the company had a stark response.",

He was spotted eating at the restaurant by a customer who alerted a McDonald's employee, state police said.\n\n\"These reviews violate our policies and have been removed,\" a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe policy says that review contributions \"should reflect a genuine experience at a place or business\" and that \"content that has been posted from multiple accounts to manipulate a place's rating\" will be removed.\n\n\"This location has rats in the kitchen that will make you sick and your insurance isn't going to cover it,\" one review said.\n\nThe insurance executive's murder unleashed a wave of frustration from Americans who have seen their health insurance claims or care denied, faced unexpected costs or paid more for premiums and medical care - all trends that are rising, according to recent data.\n\nThompson, 50, was gunned down outside a Manhattan hotel early on Wednesday morning by a masked man who appeared to wait for his arrival before shooting the executive from behind.\n\nThe suspect ran from the scene and then rode a bike into Central Park. Surveillance video captured him exiting the park and taking a taxi to a bus station in northern Manhattan, where police believe he got on a bus to flee the city. Police said Thompson appeared to be deliberately targeted.\n\nThe suspect was arrested after a five-day manhunt.\n\n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Washington; Editing by Sonali Paul)",

            "content": "By Daniel Dunaief\n\nSuffolk County reported its first case of measles in a child since 2017 this week, as an unvaccinated person under five years old contracted the infectious disease.\n\nSuffolk County health officials are working with the New York State Department of Health and Northwell Health and are taking steps to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nThe case of measles in Suffolk County is the third in the state and comes as Texas has had over 200 confirmed reports of measles since January, with 29 hospitalizations, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\n\u201cMeasles can be very serious,\u201d State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s much more than just a rash as complications can include pneumonia and inflammation of the brain, and often results in hospitalization.\u201d\n\nOfficials indicated that residents could have been exposed to the person with measles at the pediatric emergency department at Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center in Queens from March 3rd to March 4th.\n\nPatients who visited an inpatient child on the Medicine 3 unit from March 3rd to March 6th also could have had exposure.\n\nThe Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center, which is run by Northwell Health, is reaching out to patients who were at the center during the time of exposure. The Center has also identified patients who are high risk and may require timely treatment.\n\n\u201cAs we follow this case and closely monitor potential exposures, we strongly encourage all residents to protect their health and the health of our youngest and most vulnerable residents by ensuring they are on time and up to date their measles vaccines and all recommended and lifesaving immunizations.\u201d said Dr. Gregson Pigott, Suffolk County Commissioner of Health Services, said in a statement.\n\nThe incubation period for measles, which is spread by coughing or sneezing into the air, is 21 days, with symptoms that can include high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. The best way to prevent measles, according to health officials, is to get the MMR vaccine. One dose is 93 percent effective at preventing measles, while two doses are about 97 percent effective.\n\nDoctors recommend that residents receive their first dose at 12 to 15 months of age and the second at four to six years of age.\n\nMeasles during pregnancy increases the risk of early labor, miscarriage, and low birth weight infants.\n\nSeparately, area officials found two dead raccoons tested that positive for rabies in Amityville and North Amityville on March 4th and January 28th, respectively.\n\nThese are the first confirmed cases of rabid raccoons in the county since 2009\n\nThese animals had no known contact with humans or animals.\n\n\u201cWe have over 1.5 million residents [in Suffolk County] and it\u2019s not good to have raccoons running around with rabies,\u201d said Pigott. These animals can get in a fight and can transmit the rabies virus to other animals or to humans.\n\nLeft untreated, rabies, which has early symptoms including irritability, headache, fever and itchiness at the site of exposure, can be lethal.\n\nPeople can contract rabies if they are exposed to saliva or nervous tissue of a rabid animal through a bite.\n\nPigott urged pet owners to ensure their animals are vaccinated for rabies. He also suggested that people take safety measures when they are out among animals. He asks those living in Huntington, Islip, Smithtown or Babylon to contact the Department of Health Services if they encounter a dead raccoon.",

            "content": "Nearly 22 years after the March 2003 homicide of Megan McDonald, a courtroom in Goshen, New York, was called into session this week for the murder trial of Edward Holley.\n\nMegan\u2019s body was found on a narrow dirt path on March 15, 2003, in Wallkill, New York. The cause of death was blunt force trauma, with multiple fractures to the skull.\n\nHolley, who had previously dated Megan, has pleaded not guilty.\n\nHe was first arrested in April 2023 \u2014 just one month after the 20-year anniversary of Megan\u2019s murder. At the time, Holley was incarcerated for an unrelated case. However, a week later, he was released from custody because his sentence had been served in that case and Orange County District Attorney David Hoovler said protocol wasn\u2019t followed in Megan\u2019s case. In an email to NBC News, Hoovler said police had arrested Holley without consulting his office and that he hadn\u2019t pursued charges against Holley because investigators hadn\u2019t gathered enough evidence.\n\nNearly a year later, in January 2024, Holley was indicted by an Orange County grand jury for second-degree murder.\n\nFollowing that announcement, Megan\u2019s family filed a complaint against Hoovler with the judicial oversight body that investigates allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nThe complaint alleged, among other things, that Hoovler tried to stymie the investigation, and failed to disclose that, prior to becoming district attorney, he once represented a suspect in Megan\u2019s killing.\n\nIn response to NBC News\u2019 request for comment about the allegations, Hoovler replied via email that the suggestion that he or anyone in his office sought to tamper with or compromise the investigation was \u201cinaccurate, unfair and offensive.\u201d\n\nFollowing Holley\u2019s indictment, Hoovler recused his office from the case and asked that a special prosecutor be assigned. Attorney Julia Cornachio was appointed to the case.\n\nHolley\u2019s trial began this week in an Orange County courthouse.\n\nOn Monday, March 10, prosecutors delivered an opening statement postulating that Holley had lied to investigators through multiple interviews over the years, including about what car he was driving and where he was the night of the murder. They stated that the injuries Megan sustained showed anger and rage on the part of her killer, suggesting a personal connection to the victim.\n\nIn its opening statement, the defense pointed to an alternate suspect -- one of Megan\u2019s ex-boyfriends. They told jurors the prosecution would present a \u201cparade\u201d of witnesses, and cautioned them to weigh the quality of the evidence, not the quantity.\n\nOn Monday afternoon and Tuesday, the prosecution began its case, calling witnesses that included Megan\u2019s mother, one of the people who found Megan\u2019s body, and multiple investigators from the early stages of the investigation.\n\nCourt is not in session on Wednesdays. The trial is expected to last more than a month.\n\nOn Thursday, March 13, Andrea Canning featured Megan\u2019s story and the ongoing trial on the Dateline: True Crime Weekly podcast.\n\nIn the days leading up to this trial, Megan\u2019s family provided a statement to Dateline through their attorney, John Beatty. \u201cOur family will always grieve the tragic loss of our beloved Megan and we will carry the pain of losing her in such a brutal and senseless manner for the rest of our lives,\u201d it reads. \u201cWe want to make it clear that our focus throughout this process is in seeking justice for Megan and ensuring that the person responsible for her murder is held accountable.\u201d They stated that they trust the legal system to provide answers and a fair trial.\n\nMegan McDonald James Whalen\n\n\u201cThis journey has been incredibly difficult for all of us, but we are grateful for the hard work and dedication of the men and women of the New York State Police, supporting agencies and special prosecutors, who have worked tirelessly to bring us to this point,\u201d the family\u2019s statement reads.\n\nJohn Beatty provided a statement of his own on behalf of his office, saying, in part, that their hearts remain heavy with grief for the family\u2019s loss of Megan. \u201cI want to express our unwavering confidence in the legal process,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe trust that the presiding Judge and the dedicated team of special prosecutors will present the evidence to the jury with the utmost professionalism, integrity, and fairness and we appreciate the hard work of the jurors who shall see this evidence and render a just verdict.\u201d\n\nMegan\u2019s family is hoping this trial will be the final chapter in their two-decades-long fight for justice. \u201cWe look forward to this trial as the final chapter, knowing that justice for Megan will finally be served,\u201d the family statement reads. \u201cWe are optimistic that this case can serve as a beacon of hope for other families, especially those in older cases, still seeking justice for their loved ones.\u201d",

Kempczinski, who has led the QSR since 2019, told the Journal that McDonald\u2019s strategic plans emphasize greater nimbleness, but that the company needs to deploy new products and technology to restaurants faster and improve coordination with stores.\n\nKempczinski said he hoped that a year from now, the new innovation structure will help McDonald\u2019s win more market share, particularly in beef, chicken and coffee.\n\nUnder the new structure, Jill McDonald will become the restaurant\u2019s first chief restaurant experience officer, effective May 1. McDonald currently heads the company\u2019s international division that includes Europe, Canada and Australia.\n\nAccording to the Journal, in the new role she will lead a team that works across operations, supply chain, franchising, development, design, delivery and the company\u2019s innovation lab. The group will also include executives overseeing the chain\u2019s beef, chicken and beverage businesses across the globe.\n\n\u201cI wanted one person who\u2019s actually looking at all these tech things through the eyes of the restaurant general manager,\u201d Kempczinski said.\n\nMcDonald will \u201coversee the global chief supply-chain officer, helping to ensure that restaurants have the right equipment and processes for handling new menu items.\u201d Charlie Newberger, who currently helps run the company\u2019s CosMc\u2019s offshoot, will lead work on beverages and desserts.\n\nKempczinski, previously an executive at Kraft Heinz and PepsiCo, told the Journal that adopting a mindset similar to a consumer packaged-food company can help McDonald\u2019s move faster. Having executives focused solely on beverages, for example, can determine where McDonald\u2019s might need to introduce new products, he said.\n\nThe Journal reported that McDonald\u2019s is \u201cseeking to regain momentum in a tough environment for fast-food chains.\u201d McDonald\u2019s global same-store sales held steady in 2024 after several years of growth. Overall U.S. restaurant traffic fell 2.8% in 2024 and is projected to decline again this year, according to market-research firm Black Box Intelligence.\n\nIn the United States, McDonald\u2019s has slowly regained visits after a deadly E. coli outbreak last year, and the company introduced a new value menu in January.",

            "content": "McDonald\u2019s celebrated 50 years of breakfast by bringing its iconic bagel sandwich to all 50 states. This news shook me to my core\u2014I had no idea that some Americans had yet to experience the McDonald\u2019s Steak Egg & Cheese Bagel. Though you are all strangers to me, I am overcome with joy for each and every one of you.\n\nI\u2019m the country\u2019s leading fast-food critic (according to my editor), and as such, I\u2019m well-acquainted with the chain restaurant landscape. I hold unreasonably strong opinions about all fast-food burgers. And while McDonald\u2019s may be most famous for its Big Mac and Quarter Pounder, the Steak Egg & Cheese Bagel is low-key the best sandwich on the entire menu.\n\nWhat\u2019s so great about McDonald\u2019s Steak Egg & Cheese Bagel?\n\nThe breakfast menu actually has three bagel sandwiches, the others being Bacon, Egg & Cheese and Sausage, Egg & Cheese. But McDonald\u2019s Steak Egg & Cheese Bagel is something truly special. It\u2019s preposterously indulgent. This is not a healthy McDonald\u2019s breakfast by any means, nor is it something to be eaten casually. This is a sammie that you order when you need a morning meal.\n\nThe bagel is not great, and that\u2019s fantastic. I grew up in New York City, so bagels are another food group I take seriously. And if McDonald\u2019s used a serious bagel in this situation, the sandwich wouldn\u2019t be as good. This bagel is too dense and chewy to be enjoyable with cream cheese, but as the base of something marvelously greasy, it couldn\u2019t be more perfect. It sucks up all the errant juices and flavors from the fillings without losing structural integrity.\n\nAs for those fillings, there\u2019s a fluffy folded egg topped with a slice of melted American cheese and sweet roasted onions. Then there\u2019s a steak burger patty, which is exclusive to breakfast for reasons unknown. It\u2019s far better than the beef patties used on the Big Macs or McDoubles (which are small and have a tendency to dry out), with enough moisture to balance out the egg.\n\nA simple sandwich becomes sublime if all its elements work in perfect unison, and that\u2019s exactly what the McDonald\u2019s Steak Egg & Cheese Bagel achieves.\n\nWhile I think this breakfast sandwich is perfect on its own, it can be brought to higher levels of wonderment with the addition of McNugget sauces. I\u2019m partial to Buffalo, but McDonald\u2019s Tangy Barbecue Sauce is also a strong option. It\u2019s essential to request extra napkins, as this sandwich will definitely leave your hands greasy, the way good fast food should.\n\nJust remember: Even if McDonald\u2019s Steak Egg & Cheese Bagel is the best sandwich on the menu, it\u2019s only available for breakfast, so get there before 11 a.m.",

While other brands compete to see who can make the best fast-food chicken sandwich, McDonald's seems as though it can do both burgers and chicken. With that in mind, I decided to try them all to find out which one is the best.\n\nFrom spicy to classic, regular to deluxe, McDonald's doesn't have a large selection of chicken options like a Chick-fil-A or a KFC, but I was surprised to find that they do offer some tried and true sandwiches that hit the spot. In a world where McDonald's chicken sandwiches are ever more expensive, let's get a lesson on which ones should be your new go-to orders and which ones you should forgo.",

That being said, there\u2019s one simple hack on the rise right now that truly has me in a chokehold \u2013 people have started adding matcha to their McDonald\u2019s milkshakes , and it\u2019s totally transformed how I see mass-produced milkshakes from here on out.\n\nScroll on to discover the viral milkshake hack that\u2019ll have your matcha cravings running wild!\n\nNataliya Vaitkevich / PEXELS As a certified matcha freak (yeah, I said it), I've been disappointed at the lack of matcha offerings amongst fast food giants like McDonald's , Wendy\u2019s , In-N-Out , and more. Of course, Starbucks and Dunkin\u2019 scoop out matcha on the daily, but it never comes in true dessert form!\n\n\n\n@eatsbyrachel That\u2019s where this viral milkshake hack comes in \u2013 foodies have been pulling up to the drive-thru with their own doses of matcha prepped and ready, then adding it to vanilla or even strawberry milkshakes. Oh, yum! The matcha turns the frozen treats a gorgeous green color, and of course, gently caffeinates each sip.\n\nMatheus Henrin / PEXELS I think any theoretical matcha dessert offering from popular destinations like McDonald\u2019s or In-N-Out would surely see an up-charge if the chains were adding in the green powder themselves, so I\u2019m also stoked about this new method from the perspective of affordability.\n\nAnna Pou / PEXELS This hack also presents those who are not yet totally sold on matcha (um, how?!) with an accessible way to enjoy the powdered green tea blend. Matcha drinks have an infamous reputation for tasting either too grassy or too bitter (or both), so mixing it into a milkshake sweetens up each sip to the point that it doesn\u2019t taste at all like a traditional latte \u2013 but a full-on dessert !\n\n\n\nTaylor Musser / Dupe You can apply this super easy food hack to just about any milkshake from any chain that sells milkshakes like McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s (need me a Frosty, stat), In-N-Out, Dairy Queen, Sonic, and more. I suggest you pick your favorite place and try it out ASAP!\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to discover more food trends + hacks!",

            "content": "I almost didn't meet Marcus McDonald on a rainy fall day in Charleston, South Carolina. Wind gusts were strong enough to flip umbrellas and sweep them down the street, a far cry from the sunny, mid-70s days that Charleston typically delivers in October. Though conditions weren't ideal for a walking tour, I asked if we could push through. I wanted to learn as much as I could about Charleson's Black history for the short while I was in town. And there couldn't have been a better teacher than my tour guide, Marcus McDonald, who is both steeped in his community's history and dedicated to advancing it.\n\nAs we walked down King Street, the busiest tourist area of the city, we stopped in front of 18th-century Italianate and Federal-style buildings to learn about historic firsts. My son and I clutched our umbrellas, trying not to get too wet as we headed to Marion Square.\n\nLeading Black history walking tours is a side hustle for McDonald, who received his tour certification from the National Association of Interpretation. He's lived in the city for about 10 years. Still, his ancestors tie his family's presence there as far back as 1890. According to family records, they worked as cigar rollers and seamstresses shortly after emancipation. Today, McDonald works as a co-organizer for an art advocacy group called TINYisPOWERFUL, but he's most well-known as the lead organizer for Black Lives Matter Charleston.\n\nToday, McDonald works as a co-organizer for an art advocacy group called TINYisPOWERFUL, but he's most well-known as the lead organizer for Black Lives Matter Charleston.\n\nBLM Charleston has protested against many things, including police murders. McDonald said it's important to continue working across communities to fight fascism and the current president, Donald Trump, even if a higher percentage of the local people voted him into office.\n\n\"If you're not white, they're going to cut you out, you know what I mean?\" McDonald said. \"That ain't how communities work. We don't live in silos. [Trump is] about to dismantle public education. There's a lot of Black women in public education who rely on the grants to come from the public education system.\"\n\nFor now, BLM Charleston is focused on protesting book bans, censorship of Black history in the public school curriculum, and challenging the loss of diversity in the workplace.\n\nIn January 2024, three months after returning home from Charleston, I learned there had been a protest of President Biden's campaign speech inside Charleston's Mother Emmanuel AME Church. I stopped what I was doing to confirm my hunch: McDonald had participated in it in some way.\n\nI soon learned that not only had he participated, but that the disruption by BLM Charleston and Free Palestine Charleston was planned in McDonald's living room.\n\n\"It's funny,\" he said. \"I role-played as the interrupter. It's funny that I didn't even get in but Tamada ended up being the interrupter because we didn't even practice that.\"\n\nMcDonald said that the Secret Service stopped him at the second checkpoint inside the church, but since his fellow protesters made it in, he worked outside to support them as they carried out the disruption as planned. Working with Free Palestine Charleston is one of the many ways he builds solidarity with other radical movements.\n\n\"Mother Emanuel is my great-grandmama's church. I've been going there since I was a little kid. My great-grandmama was, like, 103, or 102 when she passed and Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who was still alive at that time, gave her eulogy,\" McDonald said. \"I don't like how people play with it because I came down to Charleston right after the massacre. I've seen how it gets politicized by white people in ways that I don't fuck with, specifically with Biden and the ongoing genocide, even though now there's a ceasefire.\"\n\nMcDonald takes tourists by Mother Emanuel AME Church on his walking tour. Credit: Sheeka Sanahori\n\nWhile on his tour, McDonald walked with us in front of Mother Emanuel, sharing both its notable history as the oldest AME church in the South and his personal ties to it. The activist Denmark Vesey, hanged for plotting an extensive slave insurrection in 1822, had been a founding member and the church has long been held up as a pillar against white supremacy and oppression.\n\nEach step through Charleston's Historic District felt as if there were notable stops around each corner, including at Marion Square, just a two-minute walk away.\n\nA historic stop: Charleston's Marion Square\n\nI leaned against the Francis Marion hotel building, underneath the awning and away from the rain that had now become a light drizzle. We spent the first 40 minutes of the tour walking to the corner of King and Calhoun Streets, where McDonald shared some history about Marion Square, a central gathering place for Charlestonians today.\n\nMarion Square was built in the 1820s, with its Old Citadel originally built in response to Denmark Vesey's planned slave insurrection. The crisscross sidewalks that are still in use today were designed to mimic the bars of the Confederate flag.\n\nSurviving Fascism Lessons from Jim Crow\n\nThe Baseball Riot of 1869\n\nBefore the Civil War, city police in Charleston had been armed in order to intimidate enslaved people, but the Army, based in the Citadel on the north end of Marion Square during Reconstruction, had stripped the police of their guns.\n\nIn July 1869, an argument broke out on Marion Square between a police officer and a biracial man in the crowd for a baseball game between Charleston and Savannah. When police tried to arrest the man, he resisted and other Black men stepped in to aid his resistance. As word spread of the fighting between Black folks and the police, nearly 3,000 Black Americans made their way to Marion Square and the surrounding streets. They continued protesting through the streets as a Savannah band played Dixie\u2013a song deeply tied to the antebellum South. The protests continued until the Savannah team boarded their steamboat to take them back to Georgia.\n\nIn the aftermath of the uprising, Charleston police began carrying guns and they've been armed ever since.\n\nWhen McDonald and others organized a protest in Marion Square against the in-custody killing of Jamal Sutherland in 2021, they faced a Charleston police force which by that time had been armed for more than 150 years.\n\nWhen the International African American Museum opened in Charleston in 2023, its American Journeys exhibit included a video of McDonald discussing the protest and his physical altercation with police.\n\n\"It gives some solace to me, and I know a lot of other organizers who maybe think this way, that since this has happened for so long, it's good to study and see what we can do to organize it. Even if you don't find the solution, that ain't your fault, because it's been here since before you. This predates you, but it is your duty as somebody living in this iteration to do something against it if you don't rock with it,\" McDonald's said.\n\n\"Even if you don't find the solution, that ain't your fault, because it's been here since before you. This predates you, but it is your duty as somebody living in this iteration to do something against it if you don't rock with it.\"\n\nHonoring history with action\n\nOne of the final stops on my tour was at the Anson Street African burial ground. A small plaque distinguishes the place where at least 36 enslaved people were buried in the 18th century. McDonald poured libations to these ancestors and asked us to join him in honoring them.\n\nA temporary plaque on Anson Street marks the burial place for enslaved people. Credit: Sheeka Sanahori\n\nMcDonald's love for history and community activism was inspired by his grandfather, Frank Houston. He was the family's historian with a study full of Black history books in his home.\n\nBy the time McDonald was in third grade, Houston was making him write extracurricular book reports on world-renowned artist and blacksmith Philip Simmons. Two years later, McDonald was writing about the Haitian Revolution.\n\nWhen McDonald was a teenager, he accompanied his grandfather to pass out snacks in voting lines, something his grandfather had been doing as far back as the 1960s. In 2020, McDonald took a more formal role in community organizing when he started BLM Charleston.\n\nWhether you're walking with McDonald on his Black history tour, or working on a community event, he carries the history of Black Charleston with him.\n\n\"If you study history, you care about history, be that real-life, historic person,\" he said. \"You don't have to be the one person, you can be part of a group. Be part of the group that leads us into a better way.\"",

The Fund will directly support student-athletes who progressed through the tennis-playing pathway via the USTA Foundation\u2019s National Junior Tennis & Learning (NJTL) network, a nationwide group of more than 250 sports-based community organizations that use tennis as a tool to prepare young people from under-served communities to be ready for their futures, wherever their lives take them.\n\nMcDonald, who has reached a career-high world No. 37 in the ATP singles rankings and No. 49 in ATP doubles rankings, and famously defeated Rafael Nadal in the second round of the 2023 Australian Open, had a stellar Division I collegiate career before turning professional. A native of Piedmont, Calif., McDonald competed for the UCLA Bruins from 2014-16, earning All-America honors all three years. He finished his final season ranked No. 1 in singles and doubles in the ITA collegiate rankings and swept the NCAA singles and doubles titles in 2016, making him the first man in 15 years\u2013and just the fifth since 1974\u2013to accomplish the feat.\n\nThrough the USTA Foundation, McDonald is now using his experiences and platform to inspire the next generation of college-bound students to realize what\u2019s possible and hopes this Fund will help young people understand the importance of education, and foster their personal growth in sports and beyond.\n\n\u201cGoing to UCLA turned out to be one of the best decisions I made in my life, and for my life, and I\u2019m happy to be playing a part in helping young people chase their college dreams, on and off the court,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cWorking towards ensuring that all young people, no matter where they come from, are able to unlock all the benefits that higher education has to offer is a responsibility that means so much to me, and I can\u2019t wait to see how this Fund supports not just young people and their education, but their families and communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Foundation\u2019s Mackie McDonald College Fund is not about supporting college scholarships; it\u2019s about preparing young people for the challenges they will face on and off the court at one of the most critical points in their lives,\u201d said Ginny Ehrlich, USTA Foundation CEO. \u201cMackie is committed to cultivating the next generation of leaders who are prepared to achieve their dreams in whatever field they choose. Mackie\u2019s success is a testament to the invaluable lessons that come through balancing academics with athletics, and we are thrilled to have him walk alongside us in our mission to empower these talented students with the tools they need to succeed as they grow into well-rounded adults and positively contribute to their communities.\u201d\n\nIndividual player grants are just one of the many ways the USTA Foundation supports its NJTL network, which was co-founded in 1969 by cultural icon Arthur Ashe, along with Charlie Pasarell and Sheridan Snyder. Today, the USTA Foundation helps provide over 168,000 young people nationwide access to opportunities that reach far beyond the game of tennis, including social and emotional learning programs, academic support, scholarships, and career and college readiness services. McDonald is the second professional tennis player to support the USTA Foundation through an eponymous fund; the USTA Foundation\u2019s Frances Tiafoe Fund was launched in 2023.\n\nTo learn more about the Mackie McDonald College Fund and the USTA Foundation, please visit ustafoundation.com and follow @USTAFoundation on Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn.\n\nUSTA Foundation Incorporated (USTAF or USTA Foundation), the national charitable arm of the United States Tennis Association Incorporated (USTA), utilizes the powerful combination of tennis and education to enhance the lives of under-resourced youth through its support of the National Junior Tennis & Learning (NJTL) network.

He asked Eric Gonzalez, a Westtown man who discovered McDonald\u2019s body on a muddy road off Bowser Road, about his past interviews with State Police. He asked William D\u2019Alessandro, a retired trooper who was the first to arrive at the crime scene on March 15, 2003, about his brief involvement in the initial investigation and how he drove a State Police Tahoe through what later became part of the crime scene.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe Murder of Megan McDonald newsletter Stay up to date with the latest updates in the 2003 case and the upcoming trial of Edward V.

Throughout my life, I saw firsthand how challenging it can be to maintain that environment and keep my neighbors safe and healthy. From the time I was an undergraduate at SUNY Binghamton, I knew I wanted to promote justice at all levels while creating a healthier environment.\n\nWhy did you choose to enroll in the MS in Environmental Science and Policy program at Pace?\n\nNew York State, including New York City, is a true center for environmental advocacy and science in the country and the world, with the work done here having large implications. I was drawn to the Master of Science in Environmental Science and Policy to be around this and utilize the incredible connections the program has fostered throughout its history. Additionally, I love that Pace\u2019s program allowed for a very well-rounded experience with a focus in both science and policy which I think is very important for any professional in the field.\n\nI love that Pace\u2019s program allowed for a very well-rounded experience with a focus on both science and policy which I think is very important for any professional in the field.\n\nWhat have your experiences been like with the Environmental Studies and Science department?\n\nI have had an incredible experience as a student in the program in the Environmental Studies and Science department, learning from many great faculty, but I must single out Professor Michelle Land, JD, as truly instrumental to my journey. She has been both my professor numerous times and my advisor and consistently goes above and beyond to make sure that her students are doing well inside and outside of the classroom. If I ever have questions or concerns regarding the program, my career, or anything else, she will listen and do her best to help. Professor Land is one of the most caring, knowledgeable, and passionate professors I have had throughout my academic career.\n\nWhat research have you been engaged in as a student?\n\nI am currently working on my capstone project with Riverkeeper, which involves creating a dataset of drinking water quality covering the Hudson Valley. Given the implications of the data, it combines science, policy, and advocacy in a way that is very exciting to me. I\u2019m very eager to fully process the data and learn everything I can about our drinking water.\n\nWhat internships have you had as a student?\n\nI had the opportunity to work as a climate policy intern with Waterfront Alliance, which involved conducting policy research, collaborating with other organizations to further our coalition goals, and speaking to both experts and elected officials to advance our efforts. I also had the opportunity to work at Riverkeeper for my required externship as mentioned earlier.\n\nWhat are your career goals? What would you like to do upon graduation?\n\nI began this program unsure of what exactly I wanted to do as a career. Two areas of interest to me are policy advocacy and habitat restoration, and through the experiences I have had in classes, internships, and externships, I have both honed my skills and made incredible connections for whichever path I ultimately choose.",

Jill McDonald, who currently serves as president, International Operated Markets, has been named to the newly created role of chief restaurant experience officer, effective May 1.\n\nThe company also established three new global category management teams focused on beef, chicken, and beverages/desserts.\n\nThis new structure includes the following roles, all reporting to McDonald: Warren Anderson, global supply chain; Andrew Gregory, in an expanded role leading global franchising, development, and delivery; Charlie Newberger, beverage/dessert category management; Tabassum Zalotrawala, global restaurant design (in addition to her current responsibilities leading U.S. development). The beef and chicken category leads will be announced at a later date.\n\nNotably, this announcement has changed the structure of two other functions: global marketing and new business ventures, formerly part of MCX, is now a standalone function with Morgan Flatley reporting directly to chief executive officer Chris Kempczinski; and product management and experience design will now report to global technology, led by Brian Rice. Also, with McDonald's promotion to global chief restaurant officer, Manu Steijaert will assume the role of president, IOM.\n\nRelated:Starbucks offers first look at new coffeehouse store designs\n\nAs the company notes, \"There\u2019s strong competition within the QSR industry and success is determined by our ability to gain share. In many markets, McDonald\u2019s is competing against specialists. We\u2019re bringing a specialist\u2019s focus into our operations. Setting up dedicated category teams on beef, chicken, and beverages/desserts will allow better accountability and execution to win with our core menu.\"\n\nIn a video message, Kempczinski said there are three things the company is trying to accomplish with this new Restaurant Experience Team.\n\nImprove ways of working\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about getting our horizontal ways of working into our structure,\u201d he said.\n\nThis idea of \u201cworking horizontally\u201d started in early 2023 when McDonald\u2019s announced its One McDonald\u2019s Way to find the best business cases, including digitization, throughout its global system and scale them to other markets. McDonald\u2019s also announced its Accelerating the Arches 2.0 plan in January 2023 that included some organizational restructuring and breaking down segment and market silos, which Kempczinski called \u201coutdated and self-limited.\u201d According to the company, since introducing its initial Accelerating the Arches plan in late 2020, its digital footprint has grown to more than 175 million, 90-day active users across 60 markets generating approximately $30 billion in systemwide sales from loyalty members. New restaurants have also opened at a faster rate, and menu innovation has picked up speed.\n\nRelated:Starbucks changes, Noodles\u2019 menu, Wonder\n\n\u201cAccelerating the Organization is making us sharper and faster, with integrated strategies for shared goals,\u201d the company said. \u201cWith our Restaurant Experience Team, we\u2019re bringing that vision directly into our restaurants. Thinking about creating an exceptional restaurant experience \u2014 from our food to our equipment to our operations \u2014 through the lens of a restaurant general manager to ensure all of our big ideas are working together.\u201d\n\nUse technology to improve the restaurant manager experience\n\nThe general manager is the touchpoint for all technologies, Kempczinski said, so this team will provide one point person to coordinate those solutions. Streamlining the manager experience, he added, should improve restaurant unit economics.\n\nRelated:6 take-aways from exclusive interview with Wendy\u2019s CEO Kirk Tanner\n\nBeat the competition with specialization\n\n\u201cIn so many of our categories we\u2019re competing against specialists, like a KFC for example, who single mindedly is devoted to winning in chicken,\u201d Kempczinski said. \u201cThis category team allows us to have that same level of focus to win in chicken, to win in beverages, to continue to win in beef.\u201d\n\nThe category team also allows McDonald\u2019s to better play offense against those specialists, most of which are growing at a swift pace. Of the 46 chains Technomic categorizes as coffee or \u201cother beverage/snack,\u201d for instance, 42 saw growth in 2023, including 7 Brew, which increased its unit count by 350% and its sales by 267%. Meanwhile, the chicken category has continued to drive much of the industry\u2019s growth of late due to younger consumers\u2019 preference for the protein, its versatility, and its health(ier) halo. There are also more chicken \u201cspecialist\u201d options from which consumers can choose, including traditional players like Chick-fil-A, KFC, Popeyes, Bojangles, and Church\u2019s Texas Chicken, as well as high-growth concepts like Raising Cane\u2019s, Zaxby\u2019s, and Wingstop.\n\n\u201cIt just felt to me that we could be moving faster,\u201d Kempczinski said. \u201cMoving faster on the implementation is going to be key for us to see the benefits association with these big ideas.\u201d\n\nContact Alicia Kelso at [email protected]",

            "content": "McDonald\u2019s Japan puts a crunchy spin on ichigo daifuku.\n\nThe key to McDonald\u2019s Japan\u2019s success has been the skillful way its menu both stays true to the chain\u2019s American roots but also takes into considerations local tastes. For example, should you walk into a McDonald\u2019s in Japan this month craving something sweet, the staff will be happy to serve you up an apple pie\u2026but you can also get an ichigo daifuku pie.\n\nIchigo daifuku is one of Japan\u2019s most beloved Japanese-style sweets. In its orthodox form it consists of a mochi dumpling with anko (sweet red bean paste) inside and a strawberry (ichigo in Japanese) at its core. For the Ichigo Daifuku Pie, McDonald\u2019s Japan instead takes the three ingredients of an ichigo daifuku and uses them to fill one of its pie crusts.\n\nThe result is a mix of tart and sweet flavors, but what\u2019s going to be especially intriguing for Japanese sweets fans is the texture. With regular ichigo daifuku being covered in mochi they\u2019re very stretchy treats, but since McDonald\u2019s Japan cooks their pie crusts to a crispy consistency, the Ichigo Daifuku Pie promises to have a crunchy outer layer with an inner chewiness.\n\nWith the 200-yen (US$1.35) Ichigo Daifuku Pie arriving just a little before the cherry blossoms are supposed to start blooming, McDonald\u2019s chefs have added some extra spring appeal to the dessert by giving it a pink crust evocative of sakura petals. That color connection is also a factor in the chain\u2019s newest drinks, the McFizz Peach Lemonade (300 yen) and its soft serve ice cream-topped sibling, the McFloat Peach Lemonade (380 yen).\n\n\u25bc Actress Aoi Miyazaki gets an early start to cherry blossom season in the Ichigo Daifuku Pie commercial.\n\nThe McFizz and McFloat Peach Lemonade are available now. The Ichigo Daifuku Pie will be joining them on the menu as of March 12 and is expected to be sticking around until early April.\n\nSource: McDonald\u2019s Japan (1, 2) via Entabe\n\nTop image: McDonald\u2019s Japan\n\nInsert images: McDonald\u2019s Japan, YouTube/\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u516c\u5f0f\uff08McDonald\u2019s\uff09\n\n\u25cf Want to hear about SoraNews24\u2019s latest articles as soon as they\u2019re published?

I just can\u2019t wait to play.\u201d\n\nCarroll becomes the first female basketball player from Tabor Academy to be named a McDonald\u2019s All-American.\n\n\u201cThere have been several nominees over the years, but no girl has won it until now,\u201d Becker said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable honor. It\u2019s been a privilege to work with her. We just feel really lucky to be a part of it with her.\u201d\n\nCarroll and her Tabor teammates were recently honored at the McDonald\u2019s in Fairhaven.\n\n\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d said Paul Farren, the owner/operator of the Fairhaven McDonald\u2019s. \u201cI was told there were 1,000 players that qualified, but they only picked 24. To me, that is unbelievable. That\u2019s an incredible accomplishment.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s obviously an elite player so I\u2019m thrilled. We\u2019re very happy that she came to Fairhaven to help celebrate.\u201d\n\nCarroll is bound for Kentucky\n\nCarroll remembers getting her first college offer when she was in the eighth grade at Dedham Middle School and playing \u201cup\u201d for coach Laurie Bollin with the Bay State Jaguars AAU high school team.\n\n\u201cI got my first college offer around that time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really cool. I had no idea what it meant.\u201d\n\nFast forward to her senior year at Tabor Academy and Carroll was ranked No. 15 in the 2025 recruiting class by ESPNW/HoopGurlz.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so surreal,\u201d she said. \u201cI think about it almost every single day. I think it keeps me motivated and it pushes me because sometimes rankings don\u2019t mean everything and you have to prove yourself. I\u2019m super proud of it, but it also keeps me going.\u201d\n\nEven though Carroll drew a lot of attention from college coaches, including North Carolina, Ohio State and Tennessee, she ultimately decided to go with Kenny Brooks at Kentucky University.\n\n\u201cCoach Kenny Brooks recruited me at Virginia Tech so we built a relationship back in the ninth grade,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cHe was recruiting me pretty hard then and then he left Virginia Tech and went to Kentucky and just stuck with it.

Her badly beaten body was found in a field off Bowser Road in the Town of Wallkill on March 15, 2003.\n\nLaura Murphy, one of two special prosecutors in the case, told jurors the evidence she and co-counsel Julia B. Cornachio will present will convince them to find Holley guilty of second-degree murder.\n\nHolley has pleaded not guilty to that felony charge.\n\nMurphy told jurors they will hear accounts of what happened to McDonald on her last day. She was found with multiple fractures to the back of her head, and she was bleeding from the brain. Her jaw was also fractured, there was bruising all over her body, a tooth was chipped and her fingernails were broken.\n\n\"This is a case with a lot of pieces,\" Murphy said. \"You need to look at the rage involved.\"\n\nMurphy said over the years Holley has told false stories to police about his whereabouts during the time when McDonald disappeared and was murdered during those days in March of 2003.\n\nShe said he initially denied being at a party at which McDonald also showed up, and had a detailed story about taking a trip to a mall, including an extensive list of what he bought. Then, she said, he claimed he did not leave his house for 24 hours.\n\nBut in 2019, Murphy said, Holley admitted to being at the party, and also admitted to driving a dark-colored Honda Civic, which he had denied in earlier accounts. A car matching that description was seen following McDonald's white Mercury Sable on the night she died.\n\nMcDonald's car was later found 470 feet from where Holley lived at the time, she said.\n\nPaul Weber, the lead defense attorney, began his presentation by telling jurors that no one at the defense table \"would ever minimize the pain\" that McDonald apparently went through when she died.\n\n\"We are all going to hear the evidence together,\" Weber said. \"I am asking you to stay focused, and stay alert ... Don't fall for the parade.\"\n\nWeber said the prosecution might bring 60 witnesses to the stand, but in this case \"quantity is a smokescreen.\"\n\nMore: See all of our Megan McDonald NY cold case homicide coverage here\n\nWeber told the jury it was not until 2017, when there was a change in state police investigators on the case, that police became \"laser-focused\" on Holley as a suspect, while all evidence gathered in previous years was downplayed.\n\n\"State police are still trying to get evidence against Edward Holley today,\" Weber said.\n\nOrange County Court Judge Hyun Chin Kim, who is overseeing the trial, reminded jurors twice on Monday that statements made by the prosecuting and defense attorneys are not evidence and should not be considered in reaching their verdict.\n\nThe trial is expected to take at least six weeks to complete. Kim said there will be court sessions on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays every week, with a break each week on Wednesday.\n\nMike Randall covers breaking news for the Times Herald-Record and the Poughkeepsie Journal.

Right now at participating McDonald\u2019s, 25 cents from every Shamrock Shake ordered is donated directly to the local Ronald McDonald House Charities.\n\nReminder Publishing photos by Trent Levakis\n\nWESTFIELD \u2014 It\u2019s that time of year again when the legendary Shamrock Shake has returned to McDonald\u2019s menus all across the nation, and local participating franchises alongside the team at Ronald McDonald House Charities of Connecticut and Western Massachusetts are using the annual sensation as a fundraising opportunity.\n\nUntil March 23 at participating McDonald\u2019s, 25 cents from every Shamrock Shake sold is donated directly to the local Ronald McDonald House Charities. The beloved mint-flavored treat known for its iconic green color and creamy texture is a fan favorite returning each year for the restaurant.\n\nThe effort coincides with McDonald\u2019s celebrating its 50th anniversary in partnership with Ronald McDonald House Charities and the typical two-week window has been stretched to six.\n\n\u201cWe are so excited for the extended fundraising window this year and for our customers to have even more opportunities to come and support our goal,\u201d said Western Massachusetts McDonald\u2019s owner-operator Scott Taylor. \u201cWe encourage our customers to order a Shamrock Shake and be part of the community raising money for our local RMHC, which provides comfort, care and support for families with children receiving critical care in our local hospitals.\u201d\n\nRestaurants across New England have raised a combined $270,000 over the past three years for Ronald McDonald House Charities during the Shamrock Shake fundraiser, with McDonald\u2019s customers in Western Massachusetts and Connecticut having helped raise $65,000 of that total. New England operators have set a goal of raising $100,000 this year.\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly grateful for our longstanding partnership with McDonald\u2019s and the privilege of collaborating on the Shamrock Shake promotion. The funds raised through this initiative make a meaningful difference in the lives of the families Ronald McDonald House Charities of Connecticut and Western Massachusetts serve, ensuring they have a place of comfort and support while their children receive critical medical care,\u201d said Chief Executive Officer of Ronald McDonald House Charities of Connecticut and Western Massachusetts Michelle D\u2019Amore. \u201cThis partnership is a testament to the power of community and the generosity of McDonald\u2019s customers who help us provide hope and healing to families in need.\u201d\n\nTaylor owns eight restaurants locally and credited the team at the Westfield McDonald\u2019s site at 299 E. Main St. for always doing \u201can outstanding job.\u201d The celebration of the beloved mint-flavored treat took place at the Westfield location hosted by Taylor and the team from the RMHC who assisted staff in orders.\n\n\u201cThis restaurant has already sold a lot of quarters since the start and it\u2019s adding up quick,\u201d joked Taylor on the $0.25 donation made with each purchase of the shake. \u201cWhat\u2019s special about this from my side anyways is there\u2019s not too many retailers in the world who actually collect money and then give back to the communities they do business in. I\u2019ve been involved with McDonald\u2019s since 1985 and it\u2019s always been a source of pride when we hear the stories about the families that our dollars raised here in the restaurant go to help. It\u2019s something that we can do that\u2019s tangible to give back to society.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Amore added the local RMHC chapter is located in Springfield, and it costs the organization about $120 per night to house a family.\n\n\u201cNo one is ever turned away so the work that Scott and his team are doing in terms of the Shamrock Shakes initiative, it really allows us to serve more families on an ongoing basis at no charge,\u201d said D\u2019Amore. \u201cThis is 50 years that McDonald\u2019s has been selling the Shamrock Shakes. We as an organization, the first house opened 50 years ago in Philadelphia and it\u2019s because of folks like Scott, and others over the past 50 years that we are able to continue to support our mission.\u201d",

Courtesy of Congresswoman Kristen McDonald Rivet Congressman Randy Feenstra represents Iowa's 4th Congressional District. Courtesy of Congressman Randy Feenstra\n\nMichigan Democratic Congresswoman Kristen McDonald Rivet and Iowa Republican Congressman Randy Feenstra introduced the Foreign Agricultural Restrictions to Maintain Local Agriculture and National Defense (FARMLAND) Act on Friday.\n\nThe bipartisan legislation would authorize the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to review all purchases or leases of American farmland by foreign entities that exceed $5 million or 320 acres.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe FARMLAND Act would also require the Secretaries of Agriculture and Homeland Security to publish an annual report outlining any threats or national security risks of foreign investment in American farmland, direct the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a public database of all farmland owned by foreign governments and other entities, and limit foreign-owned or operated land from participating in Farm Service Agency programs like the commodity programs.\n\n\u201cAllowing China or other foreign competitors to buy up large swaths of American farmland puts our national security and food supply at risk,\u201d McDonald Rivet said. \u201cThis bill is a key step towards protecting American interests from falling into the hands of bad actors abroad, especially China.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is in the interest of the United States to review purchases of American farmland by foreign entities to protect our farms and agricultural production from our foreign adversaries, especially China. But for far too long, our government has repeatedly failed to enforce the laws on the books, monitor foreign purchases of our farmland, or assess financial penalties on those who break our laws,\u201d Feenstra said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I introduced the FARMLAND Act to develop new oversight measures for foreign farmland purchases, bolster the USDA\u2019s ability to report the threats of foreign acquisition of American farmland, and close security gaps that allow foreign adversaries to evade disclosing farmland purchases. Born and raised in rural Iowa, I firmly believe that American farmland belongs to American farmers, and I will continue to lead the fight to protect our farmers and ensure that our farms are passed onto the next generation, not our foreign enemies,\" Feenstra continued.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nSenators Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) are introducing corresponding legislation in the Senate.\n\nUnder current law, the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act (AFIDA) requires foreign investors who acquire, transfer, or hold any interest in American farmland to report holdings and transactions to the Secretary of Agriculture. However, enforcement of AFIDA has been virtually nonexistent. To highlight the lack of oversight, China\u2019s ownership of American farmland increased by 30% between 2019 and 2020 alone. Modernizing the AFIDA reporting process through the FARMLAND Act provides the needed national security that farmers and rural communities deserve.\n\nAdditionally, as of September 2022, the U.S. Department of Agriculture had only assessed eight financial penalties against foreign investors since 2012.",

            "content": "The report further mentioned that The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 also played a significant role in boosting dividends and share buybacks in 2018. By lowering the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, the legislation contributed to a surge in shareholder returns, with buybacks and dividend payouts reaching multi-year highs the following year. As the TCJA approaches its expiration in 2025, discussions around corporate tax reductions have resurfaced. While the proposed decrease from 21% to 15% is not as substantial as the previous cut, it could still provide an upside for shareholder returns within the broader market once a final decision is reached.\n\nWhile analysts remain cautious about the market\u2019s ability to sustain its recent gains, dividend stocks have increasingly drawn their attention for several reasons. According to Ameriprise Financial, the S&P index is widely regarded as one of the most significant benchmarks for global equity markets. Over the past decade, dividend growth and share buybacks have become defining characteristics of the index, which includes numerous global dividend-paying companies. Dividend growth saw a sharp slowdown in the final quarter of 2024, largely attributed to the election and uncertainty surrounding potential policy changes. With these concerns now in the past, Ameriprise Financial expects a resurgence in dividend growth within the broader market. For 2025, projections indicate a potential 8% increase in dividend payouts, following growth rates of 6% in 2024 and 5% in 2023.\n\nAmid concerns about economic growth and uncertainty surrounding former President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been turning to defensive strategies. In this environment, dividend stocks have proven resilient, offering both stability and attractive passive income. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks companies with a history of at least 25 years of consistent dividend growth, has climbed by over 5.3% in 2025. In contrast, the broader market has declined by nearly 1.7%, as of the close of March 7.\n\nDividend stocks have taken a backseat in the market as technology and AI-driven equities have soared to record highs. However, analysts at Ned Davis Research believe that a more challenging macroeconomic landscape this year could create opportunities for dividend stocks to regain momentum.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 14 Best Performing Dividend Stocks To Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCompanies with a history of regular dividend payments are generally seen as stable investments, reflecting their strong cash flow and financial resilience. These businesses are often found in defensive sectors such as consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, which tend to be less affected by economic fluctuations. As a result, they help investors manage portfolio risks more effectively. At the beginning of 2025, growing concerns over rising inflation and sluggish economic growth led investors to increase their exposure to defensive stocks. This shift in strategy was intended to protect portfolios from potential market volatility linked to these economic uncertainties.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team shared their perspective on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned the list of companies that have delivered positive returns in 2025. From that group, we identified dividend companies with strong dividend policies and stable cash positions. We began with a pool of fifty companies, narrowed it down by considering their share price increases, and ultimately selected the top 14 dividend stocks with the highest share price gains as of March 7, arranging them in ascending order of performance.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs McDonald\u2019s Corporation (MCD) the High Growth Food Stock to Buy?\n\nA cook in a busy kitchen assembling cheeseburgers for orders.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)\n\nYear-to-Date Return as of March 7: 9.43%\n\nMcDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast-food company that offers a wide menu of food, beverages, and desserts. The company delivered a disappointing quarterly performance, falling short of investor expectations. One factor was an E. Coli outbreak that impacted certain menu items, including the widely popular Quarter Pounder. However, while this incident contributed to the decline, the company\u2019s challenges extended beyond just the fourth quarter.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) reported $6.4 billion in revenue, reflecting a slight 0.2% year-over-year decline and missing analysts\u2019 estimates by over $88 million. Global same-store sales, which measure the performance of locations open for at least a year, inched up by 0.4%. However, in its core US market, same-store sales dropped 1.4%, highlighting a slowdown in growth and difficulty in sustaining sales momentum. Despite these challenges, the stock has risen by over 9% in 2025 so far, which makes it one of the best performing stocks that pay dividends.\n\nEven with these setbacks, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) remains attractive to investors due to its solid dividend history and financial stability. The company's quarterly dividend came in at $1.77 per share for a dividend yield of 2.21%, as of March 7. By the end of fiscal 2024, it held over $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with total assets nearing $12 billion. In addition, the company has raised its dividend for 48 consecutive years.\n\nOverall MCD ranks 12th on our list of the best performing dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for MCD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MCD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

These findings, coupled with data from the previously conducted RELIEF-DPN-1 study (NCT04455633), identified 10 mg once daily as an appropriate dose to advance into phase 3 development for DPNP.

On the primary end point of change in average daily pain score (ADPS), patients in the 10 mg, 20mg/10 mg, and 20 mg dose arms achieved reductions of 1.74, 1.70, and 1.38, respectively, over the 8-week treatment period. In comparison, those on placebo demonstrated reductions of 1.31 in ADPS.\n\nLate-breaking findings using data from the CAVS-MS study showed that nearly one-fifth of patients with atypical clinical symptoms or radiological-only presentation met the latest criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS) using the updated 2024 McDonald Criteria revisions. The study suggests that the central vein sign (CVS) is a valuable para-clinical tool for confirming MS diagnosis in individuals with atypical symptoms or radiological-only presentation, thus opening the door for initiating treatment earlier. Presented at the 2025 Americas Committee for Treatment & Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum, held February 27-March 1, in West Palm Beach, Florida, the analysis included 420 participants who were undergoing evaluation for MS. Of these, 166 were adjudicated as having atypical onset and an additional 25 were adjudicated as having radiological-only presentation. Of this group (n = 191), 19% (n = 36) met diagnostic criteria when applying the 2024 McDonald Criteria, which ultimately will allow for earlier treatment and potentially altering of patients\u2019 disease course.\n\nThe FDA has granted approval for an expanded indication of eculizumab (Soliris; Alexion/AstraZeneca) to include both adult and pediatric patients who are 6 years of age or older with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are antiacetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive. With the approval, it becomes the first and only treatment for pediatric patients living with the disease. The use of eculizumab in pediatric patients for this indication was supported by evidence from a well-controlled trial in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients with gMG who are 12 years of age and older, as well as pharmacokinetic and safety data in other pediatric populations in the range of at least 6 years to younger than 12 years. In a 26-week, single-arm study of 11 pediatric patients with gMG 12 to 17 years of age, adverse reactions were consistent with those observed in adults living with the disease.\n\nFor more direct access to expert insight, head to NeurologyLive.com.

On Friday, shares of McDonald's (MCD) hit a record high. Over the last week, its stock rose 5%, even as tariff news roiled the broader market.\n\nYum Brands' (YUM) (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell) shares are up 22% year to date, while Restaurant Brands International (QSR) (Burger King, Tim Hortons, Popeyes) have climbed 6%. S&P 500 returns are essentially flat on the year.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of Chipotle (CMG), Cava (CAVA), and Shake Shack (SHAK) sank 9%, 11%, and 15% in the past week, respectively, a reversal of fortunes as investors in recent years have favored the more upscale, fast-casual sector.\n\nMcDonald's \"value menu is driving positive guest traffic in a slowing environment for almost all other restaurants,\" Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan told Yahoo Finance. \"It\u2019s all about a rotation into the larger players given the uncertain market environment too.\"\n\nThe long-term future of the industry remains cloudy. The \"unpredictable nature\" of tariff announcements is causing frustration, from franchise owners to the manufacturing community to agribusiness, Phil Kafarakis, CEO of the Food Away From Home Association (IFMA), told Yahoo Finance.\n\nOn Thursday, President Trump extended a one-month tariff exemption to goods compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). He initially announced a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico in February but has since paused them twice.\n\nNon-compliant goods will still pay the new duties. The exemption is scheduled to expire on April 2, when Trump is expected to announce his reciprocal tariff plan.\n\nThough restaurants source more items domestically, Neil Saunders of GlobalData told Yahoo Finance that tariffs still make it extremely challenging to plan ahead.\n\nThe Budget Lab at Yale predicts that overall prices for gas, rubber and plastic products, processed rice, machinery and equipment, vegetables, fruit, sugar, and dairy could increase in the low- to mid-single digits.\n\nOne McDonald's franchise owner told Yahoo Finance it's still unknown what this could mean for equipment costs, calling it \"nerve-racking\" when it already costs roughly $25,000 for one piece of kitchen equipment.\n\nUtility prices will also affect restaurants, even if energy is subjected to lower duties.",

            "content": "If you're craving McDonalds but want to stick to somewhat healthier options, certain menu items can help hit the spot without completely derailing your health and fitness progress. Many items are high-calorie but also contain a surprisingly impressive amount of protein, and while dessert items are understandably higher in sugar, there isn't a ton of sugar randomly added to other sandwiches, fries, and nuggets. So what should you choose to have as a treat, without having to feel not-great afterwards? Here are 5 items to eat and 5 to avoid at McDonald's, based on nutrition.\n\nEat This: Egg McMuffin, Not That: Hotcakes\n\nMcDonald's has an excellent breakfast menu, but the health benefits of items differ wildly. One of the best choices for a nutritious start to the day is the Egg McMuffin, which is just 310 calories, contains 17g of protein, and just 3g of sugar. You also get all the nutrients of a whole, freshly-cracked egg, and lean meat. In comparison, the McDonald's Hotcakes are 580 calories, 45g of sugar, and just 9g of protein. There's no question which one is better for you (and frankly more delicious).\n\nEat This: Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Not That: Double BBQ Bacon Quarter Pounder with Cheese\n\nSometimes only a really good, juicy burger will hit the spot, and luckily you can get that on the McDonald's menu without going overboard with calories and sugar. The Quarter Pounder with Cheese has 520 calories, a very decent 30g of protein, and 10g of sugar for what's quite a filling sandwich. On the other hand, the Double BBQ Bacon Quarter Pounder with Cheese is impressive protein-wise, containing 54g of protein, but it also has 850 calories and 12g of sugar. It also has 54g of fat vs the Quarter Pounder with Cheese's 26g of fat.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e\n\nMcDonald's New Menu Item Features Today's Biggest Basketball Stars\n\nEat This: Chicken McNuggets, Not That: French Fries\n\nWhat's your favorite side: Nuggets or fries? A 6-piece serving of McDonald's Chicken McNuggets contains 250 calories, zero sugar, and 14g of protein. Compare that to a small serving of McDonald's French Fries which contains 230 calories, 3g of protein, but also zero sugar. The McNuggets clearly have the edge nutrition-wise but McDonald's fries are famous for good reason.\n\nEat This: Vanilla Cone, Not That: Vanilla Shake\n\nMcDonald's sweet treats are iconic, from Shamrock Shakes to Oreo McFlurries. The McDonald's soft serve Vanilla Cone is 200 calories, 5g of protein, and 23g of sugar, making it a perfectly reasonable dessert. On the other hand the small Vanilla Shake is 480 calories, with 10g of protein and 51g of sugar. The Vanilla Cone is clearly the way to go, sweet enough without going overboard.\n\nEat This: McCrispy, Not That: McChicken\n\nWhat if you want a chicken sandwich? The McCrispy is 470 calories, contains 26g of protein, and 9g of sugar. Meanwhile the McChicken is 390 calories, with 14g of protein and 4g of sugar. The McCrispy has 20g of fat and the McChicken has 21, but overall the McCrispy offers a better protein amount and will probably keep you feeling full for longer. However, if calories are more of a concern than macronutrients, the McChicken is the way to go.",

Born on May 22, 1946, in Alpena, Roger was the beloved son of the late Delmar and Bertha (Schiler) McDonald.\n\nAfter dedicating 37 years of his life to Abitibi as a press operator, Roger embraced retirement with the same vigor he applied to his career. He approached every day with a joyful spirit, often brightening up the room with his infectious laugh and quick wit. It is said that he took great joy in being called Roscoe P. Coultrane, a nickname that truly captured his lively essence.\n\nThroughout his life, Roger took pride in serving his country in the United States Navy, wearing his service with honor. His passions extended far beyond his professional endeavors; he cherished playing softball in his younger years, enjoyed the challenge of crossword puzzles, and relished the thrill of all sports. Neighbors often smiled as they witnessed him mowing his lawn or tending to those nearby\u2013his trusty riding lawnmower became a symbol of his caring nature and willingness to lend a hand. No season was complete without Roger feeding the birds and deer, finding joy in the simplicity of connecting with nature.\n\nRoger is survived by his two sons, Curt (Tammie) McDonald and Douglas (Tabitha) McDonald, who carry forward his spirit through the love and lessons he imparted, He was the best Dad anyone could ask for. He was a proud grandfather, leaving behind seven grandchildren and thirteen great-grandchildren. His sister Winifred remains a cherished part of his family, reminding them of the bonds that transcend time.\n\nRoger\u2019s kind nature earned him the title of the best father-in-law in the world, an esteemed accomplishment he held close to his heart. He touched the lives of many with his warmth and caring demeanor, and his passing leaves an irreplaceable void. Those who knew him will fondly remember the smile that lit up his face and the joy that followed him wherever he went.\n\nRoger is preceded in death by his parents, Delmar and Bertha, along with his siblings Fran, Virginia, and Harland. As a kind, caring, and fun-loving man, Roger E. McDonald will be dearly missed by all whose lives he touched. A private family memorial service will be held at a later date, honoring the remarkable life of a man who brought so much joy to those around him.",

Holley had been a suspect in the investigation that spanned two decades, but State Police did not charge him until April 20, 2023. He was indicted by a grand jury nine months later \u2014 a process that was drawn out after the Orange County district attorney recused himself and special prosecutors were appointed. The indictment alleges he did not act alone. Holley has maintained his innocence in several police interviews over the years.\n\nThe prosecution has a list of 80 witnesses they may call during the trial. The defense has listed more than 30 potential witnesses. Judge Kim expects the trial to last through April 11.\n\nJury selection began on the morning of March 3. Each round started with Kim asking a subgroup of jurors about their associations with prosecutors, Holley\u2019s lawyers, witnesses, exposure to media coverage of the case, and other general questions that assessed their ability to serve. Then Kim moved to one-on-one interviews with some jurors in hourslong closed sessions. Most were eliminated during that process.\n\nWhoever was left became part of voir dire, a final step in deciding who sits on the jury. During this stage, attorneys learn more about each candidate, including what they like to do in their spare time, where they work and if they have prior jury experience. They also ask about their abilities to be open-minded and fair.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe Murder of Megan McDonald newsletter Stay up to date with the latest updates in the 2003 case and the upcoming trial of Edward V. Holley. Sign up here.\n\n\u2018Are you up for this?\u2019\n\nThe lawyers went through a handful of voir dire rounds with 20 to 26 candidates at a time. Each attorney took a slightly different approach.\n\nOn Wednesday, one of Holley\u2019s defense attorneys, Chris Sevier, began with a serious question: \u201cAre you up for this? That\u2019s a question I want you to ask yourselves.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nHe apparently tried to test the candidates\u2019 ability to judge testimony using a hypothetical trial about financial theft, but after being stopped by the judge, he had to move on. So, he polled them on their favorite books, movies and TV shows. The questioning brought up moments of levity as jurors and Sevier went back and forth about their favorite ways to be entertained. But in the end, he circled back to the seriousness of the moment.\n\nThe trial will be long, Sevier told them. It will be intense. It will not be fun. Their job will be difficult.\n\nSpecial prosecutors Laura Murphy and Julia Cornachio employed a more conversational approach, peppering prospective jurors about their jobs, favorite authors and aspirations. Murphy asked two groups of jury candidates to promise not to hold prosecutors to a \u201cgreater burden\u201d than they are tasked with.\n\nAll the attorneys reminded the candidates that they must only make decisions based on what they learn in the courtroom. Judge Kim also reminded jurors of the roles of each party. The defense doesn\u2019t have to prove anything; Holley is presumed innocent unless the prosecution can prove he is guilty.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nOn Thursday evening, defense attorney Eli Siems used the Socratic method to address the pool, asking what they should do if something at trial reminds them of a news story they read. A volunteer at the Newburgh Armory Unity Center said she would notify the judge and attorneys. Before Siems could comment on her answer, a retired EMT next to her jumped in. They should push it aside, she said, because it wasn\u2019t something they learned inside the courtroom.\n\nThe former EMT was chosen as a juror in the final round.\n\nThe jurors will report back to court Monday morning to hear each party\u2019s opening statements.",

(We didn\u2019t say that they had accepted a lot of them.) But Ratiq chose to take it to the next level and argued that Apple Pay would be accepted at the chain drive-thru windows.\n\nIn a delightful story in Recode, the author pushed Rafiq for specifics after the executive \u201ctalked in generalities a bit.\u201d He eventually pushed the exec to send a photograph of it might look like. That\u2019s the image illustrating this story.\n\n\u201cCustomers who want to use their new iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus to pay will have to tell the drive-through cashier that they are paying with their phone. The cashier will then extend a portable payment terminal out toward the driver\u2019s-side window,\u201d the story said. \u201cThe driver then can place their finger on the phone\u2019s fingerprint ID sensor and tap or wave their phone in front of the payment device just outside their window. Will people prefer paying that way to handing over cash or credit? That may depend on how prepared the window attendants are and whether they can keep the \u2018fast\u2019 in \u201cfast food.\u201d\n\nA few thoughts. First, those terminals are not especially light, as evidenced by the employee in the photo having to hold it with both arms. Secondly, while holding it outside the window, it is fully exposed to the elements. What happens if it\u2019s pouring rain or snowing heavily? Beyond being potentially damaged, that unit is going to get progressively heavier in that snowstorm. For that matter, customers will have to hold their iPhones out in the same weather elements and it\u2019s not clear that that will be good for the phone.\n\nThe story said that McDonald\u2019s has further plans for ApplePay. \u201cAccepting Apple Pay is just one step in series of digital enhancements coming to McDonald\u2019s locations, according to Rafiq. The company will place an Apple Pay button on a forthcoming app, Rafiq said, though he declined to reveal specifics of what the app will do. Since payments will be involved, it could be an order-ahead app, like the one the company is currently testing at select locations in Alabama and Georgia.\u201d",

Trial details, what to know\n\nEdward Holley is on trial for the murder of Megan McDonald, who was found beaten to death in 2003.\n\nHolley was charged 20 years after McDonald's death, a cold case that captured the community in the region for decades.\n\nIn Orange County Court, the case against Holley will involve special prosecutors, an absent potential suspect who died long before Holley's arrest and testimony regarding how Megan McDonald died that night in March.\n\nHere are some of the key figures in the case.\n\nMegan McDonald\n\nOn March 15, 2003, 20-year-old Megan McDonald was found bludgeoned to death in a field off Bowser Road in the Town of Wallkill. She was the daughter of Betty Jo McDonald and Dennis McDonald, an NYPD detective who investigated the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. He died of a heart attack in 2002.\n\nMcDonald was a graduate of John S. Burke Catholic High School in Goshen in 2000, and at the time of her death she was taking classes at SUNY Orange Community College, and waitressing at American Cafe restaurant in the Galleria at Crystal Run in the Town of Wallkill.\n\nShe had been Holley's girlfriend, but they were no longer a couple at the time of her death.\n\nFatal crash: Middletown man killed in head-on crash on Route 17 in Harriman\n\nEdward Holley\n\nMcDonald's former boyfriend, Edward Holley, 44, of Wawayanda, has been charged with second-degree murder in her death. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nHe has been confined to a wheelchair since a 2007 car crash. If convicted, he faces up to 25 years to life in state prison.\n\nAndre Thurston\n\nAccording to an internal report reviewed by the USA Today Network in 2024, New York State Police believed Andre Thurston was in the car where McDonald was murdered.\n\nThurston, who was represented by Orange County District Attorney David Hoovler when he was a defense attorney, was never charged in the case. He died in 2010.\n\nDavid Hoovler\n\nNow Orange County's district attorney, Hoovler's office is not prosecuting the case because of a past connection.\n\nIn 2008, while he was a defense attorney, Hoovler represented Thurston and sought a plea deal for him, according to the internal state police report reviewed by the USA Today Network.\n\nFive days after Holley\u2019s arrest, Hoovler informed the McDonald family he would recuse himself and his office and hand the case to a special prosecutor.\n\nSpecial prosecutors\n\nInstead of Hoovler's office, the case is being prosecuted by two special prosecutors, Julia B. Cornachio and Laura Murphy.\n\nCornachio is a long-time Westchester County prosecutor, while Murphy is a veteran of the Westchester DA's Cold Case bureau.\n\nDefense attorneys\n\nAttorney Paul Weber is leading Holley's defense team and is being assisted by Christopher Sevier and Eli Siems.\n\nThe defense has objected to the appointment of the special prosecutors, maintaining that because they are being paid up to $300 an hour, with no cap, they were financially motivated to continue prosecuting their client.\n\nDOT study: NY may consider safety improvements at Rosendale intersection where pedestrian was killed\n\nBut Orange County Court Judge Hyun Chin Kim denied their objection and noted it had been raised rather late in the process.\n\nThe judge\n\nOverseeing the trial is Orange County Court Judge Hyun Chin Kim.\n\nHolley's defense lawyers have also made repeated motions for her to step down from the case, on the grounds that her principal law clerk, Karen Edelman-Reyes, worked in the Orange County District Attorney's office when McDonald's murder was being investigated.\n\nBut Kim said Edelman-Reyes had been screened from the McDonald case from the earliest days she was presiding over it, and she has denied all motions for her to step down.\n\nMike Randall covers breaking news for the Times Herald-Record and the Poughkeepsie Journal.

And they had actual party planners on staff? They were fun times.\u201d\n\nOne X user explained that this change might be due to the bigger overhaul McDonald\u2019s restaurants have been going through. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the new ones. They\u2019ve reworked their entire design to reflect less employees and more screens. \u2018Automated McDonalds\u2019 bc employees are only cooking. There\u2019s no playground. Just places to wait for pickup,\u201d they said.\n\nIn her latest update, French shared an old photo of what the Franklin McDonald\u2019s used to look like before a fire.\n\n\u201cHey guys! This was the previous McDonald\u2019s structure that had to be replaced due to fire. The new \u2018kids play place\u2019 I posted below is to replace this enormous kids area,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIs it liability issues? Cutting costs? Is it corporate feelings uneasy about the idea of moms finding hours of reprieve in these kinds of places for a $5 Happy Meal?

Both coming from Black religious households Houston and New York, respectively, looking back don\u2019t know why we thought it was a good idea, but it was the onset of a shift in family dynamics as we knew them. Being two femmes in the LGBTQ community, who don\u2019t always \u201clive out loud,\u201d has often come with its own hang ups.\n\nBy the end of sophomore year, Joy had become a part of the multitude of first generation students that couldn\u2019t afford to stay any longer. For the next two years after that, we\u2019d try our hardest to make it work while Brandy stayed in school, Joy moved back home, and our families were boldly navigating their dismay. We\u2019d break up after Brandy\u2019s graduation because life and the pressure of family told us it was best and the phase should be over. We dated other people just to realize how imperfectly perfect and equally yoked we truly were.\n\nI moved back to DC in 2012 and we started dating again as two young adults blocking out the noise, away from home. The following year, we moved in together and were getting settled in our careers and life. In 2014, while Joy was working at GWU, an LGBTQ couple was involved in a horrible incident. Unfortunately, one of the partners had a freak accident and passed away. He was completely estranged from his family at the time. Not only did they come and take his body, and misappropriate his identity, but most heartbreakingly, they banned his partner from any participation in services or even the right to say goodbye. Joy came home devastated, unable to shake that feeling. Gay marriage was just recently passed in D.C. and we said, \u201cI do,\u201d less than 30 days later.\n\nBlackLove.com Related Articles:\n\nFrom Sorority Life to Married Life: A Delta and AKA Wedding to Remember\n\n6 Things I Wish You Knew About Standing Up for the LGBTQ People in Your Life\n\nHappy Pride! These Queer Black Fathers Are Making a Difference\n\nOur tribe stepped up to give us the best HU homecoming wedding weekend we could all muster and afford. We decided collectively to celebrate in a way we could all afford that allowed our friends to be present, and what better way than homecoming \u2014 Howard NEVER lost a party. While I do feel like our initial wedding was rooted in the fear and trauma of our families dishonoring our place in each other\u2019s lives, I don\u2019t know where either one of us would be if we didn\u2019t take that chance on us then.\n\nWe relocated to Houston as newlyweds in 2015 and faced one of the most difficult transitions that we weren\u2019t sure we\u2019d make it through. While we truly believe our parents have done the best they know how, navigating their doctrine and ideas of who they wanted and wish us to be, we realized we were allowing the wrong voices to control our narrative. We had a village waiting for us to be free so they could accept, show up and support us in a way we were truly jumping through hoops hoping others would.\n\nIt\u2019s taken us a decade to heal, regroup, find our way individually, professionally, and as a unit. We couldn\u2019t be more proud of us, a decade into marriage. We don\u2019t even think we realized how much we still wanted the dream wedding, because we had so long convinced ourselves we didn\u2019t deserve tradition and our love and special moments should be reserved and not for display. Last year, we were overjoyed to be able to plan the wedding and 10-year vow renewal of our dreams, and the freedom to finally celebrate our love out loud, as big as it has always been privately.\n\nA Vow Renewal Steeped in Style, Soul, and Celebration\n\nWe wanted to create a romantic and intimate atmosphere\u2014one that honored not just our love but the incredible journey we\u2019ve shared with our tribe. A decade of love, laughter, and growth deserved a celebration as bold and timeless as our bond.\n\nOur ceremony was officiated by our married couple friends\u2014two people who have been a testament to leading by example and loving out loud.\n\nOne of the most meaningful parts of the ceremony was our ring blessing ritual. As a symbol of the love, wisdom, and strength that our tribe has poured into us, our rings were passed through the hands of our bridal party before we exchanged them\u2014each person offering their blessings, prayers, and well wishes for our next decade together. It was a powerful, emotional moment that reminded us love is not just between two people, but something nurtured and uplifted by community.\n\nThe Vibe: \u201cCruella Couture\u201d Meets Black-Tie Elegance\n\nBeing married to a stylist is a flex, and this renewal was proof of that! With a stunning black-and-white aesthetic\u2014what we lovingly call Cruella Couture\u2014every detail was intentional, from our attire to the ambiance. Handcrafted looks, custom styling, and a bridal crew that understood the assignment set the tone for a night of sophistication and soul.\n\nOf course, no wedding experience is complete without finding the dress. Ten years ago, we went to Potomac Mills and found the cutest all-white looks we could. This time, we got to live every girl\u2019s dream\u2014an appointment at the largest bridal store in the U.S.! Thanks to our bestie Nelly, not only did we get to experience this unforgettable moment, but the owner personally welcomed us, and our consultant, Brandi, made the experience even more special. Champagne, giggles, tears\u2014and most importantly, we said YES to the dress!\n\nOur Tribe: The Heart of Our Celebration\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t trade our people for the world. They\u2019ve laughed with us, cried with us, lifted us up, and, most importantly, never lost a party! With over 30 years of collective love and friendship between us all, we realized\u2014somehow\u2014we\u2019ve become \u2018the adults\u2019 now. This night was as much for them as it was for us.\n\nAs true foodies, we knew our celebration wouldn\u2019t be complete without a dining experience that reflected our love story. We curated a 10-course menu, each dish symbolizing a moment, a memory, or a milestone in our journey together\u2014from late-night NYC dates to Baecations in Phoenix to our favorite hometown flavors. With the magic touch of our wedding planner @d.concierge and culinary extradonair @bitesbybeehouston, every bite told a story, and every toast honored a decade of love.\n\nAnd because the party didn\u2019t stop at the ceremony, we extended the celebration all weekend long. One of the highlights? An iconic live brunch station featuring the infamous Katz\u2019s Delicatessen flown in straight from New York\u2014complete with a carver on-site. Because when we celebrate, we do it BIG.\n\nFrom the first vows to this renewal, our love has remained as bold, vibrant, and unapologetically us as ever. Love wins, and we still do\u2014now and always. This wedding was our birthright, a re-coming out, a celebration reflective of a love only we can share, and a forum for our tribe to show up and out for us in ways we never thought possible. We are beyond grateful for the past, honoring the present and are looking forward to all the years to come!\n\nMeet the Vendors:\n\n@colordujourphotography (Photography)\n\n@d.concierge (wedding planner)\n\n@kleinfeldbridal (Brides Gowns)\n\n@Legacylapels (Bride squad\u2019s custom suits)\n\n@sirtroy.alexander (Joy\u2019s Hair)\n\n@qmanesociety (Brandy\u2019s Hair)\n\n@makeupbymekhi (Brides Makeup)\n\n@glamdbyannick (Bride\u2019s Nails)\n\n@glammedbycozette_ @vanitythrone (Bridal make up)\n\n@jada_s (Bridal squad hair)\n\n@bitesbybeehouston (Catering)\n\n@weddingcakesbytammyallen (Wedding cake)\n\n@happydayzec (Social content creator)",

There are also outlets in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia. There isn\u2019t a single location in the United States.\n\nMixue Bingcheng was founded in 1997 by Zhang Hongchao, and originally started out as a store selling shaved ice and cold drinks.\n\n\u201cLet people around the world eat well and drink well for just two American dollars,\u201d Hongchao previously told Chinese state media about his strategy for the business.\n\nMixue Bingcheng has over 45,000 restaurants worldwide, while McDonald\u2019s has around 41,800 (Getty Images)\n\nOver 99 percent of the bubble tea chain\u2019s stores are franchised, with most of their revenue coming from selling food materials, equipment, and packaging to its franchisees.\n\nAlthough Mixue Bingcheng does have the highest number of locations worldwide, its revenue is still behind other large drink chains in the U.S., such as Starbucks and Tim Hortons.\n\nIts growth is rapid, though. According to its prospectus, Mixue\u2019s net profit jumped 42 percent to 3.49 billion yuan ($479 million) in the first nine months of 2024 from the same period in the previous year. Its revenue increased 21 percent to 18.7 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nSweet, milky and colourful, bubble tea is wildly popular in China, where people sipping through straws from large plastic cups is a common sight in high streets and shopping malls across the country (Jade GAO/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, McDonald\u2019s revealed the breakfast orders of various celebrities the day after the Oscars celebrations. The commercial started with the time stamp of 9:14 a.m. at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Hollywood.\n\nThe clip showed a receipt machine churning out the orders, such as Colman Domingo\u2019s Egg McMuffin meal \u2014 which comes with hash browns and a coffee \u2014 with strawberry jelly and ketchup on the side.\n\nActor Teyana Taylor, who attended the Vanity Fair Oscar Party on Sunday, scarfed down McDonald\u2019s Hotcakes (pancakes) with egg and sausage, a McChicken Biscuit with cheese, and a side of strawberry jelly and butter.\n\nSinger Rosal\u00eda, who also attended the after-party, ordered a McGriddles \u2014 a breakfast sandwich with bacon, egg, and cheese \u2014 with a mango-pineapple smoothie and a mayo packet.\n\nIn February, McDonald\u2019s reported a fourth-quarter net income of $2.02 billion, or $2.80 per share, down from $2.04 billion, or $2.80 per share, a year earlier.\n\nThe fast food chain\u2019s sales suffered after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked a fatal E. coli outbreak to its Quarter Pounder burgers.",

The pair are two of just 10 players across the 13-team league to receive the distinction.The award is McDonald's second all-conference honor after earning second-team All-G-MAC in 2023-24, and comes as a deserving reward for one of the finest all-around seasons in program history. McDonald led the 20-8 Chargers in points, rebounds, assists and steals and ranked seventh or better in the G-MAC in all four categories, including second among all league players in both assists and steals per game, while also finishing in the top 10 in the G-MAC in both field goal percentage and free throw percentage.McDonald was a leader throughout the season for the Chargers, scoring in double figures in 23 of Hillsdale's 28 games, including six efforts of 20 or more points, headlined by a monster 30 point, 10 rebound double-double in Hillsdale's regular-season ending 68-61 win at Malone on March 1 that clinched a runner-up finish in the G-MAC. That was one of four double-doubles the 5-foot-9 point guard had during the 2024-25 season, along with 10 games with five or more assists and 12 games with three or more steals.A transfer from the Air Force Academy who has played just two and a half seasons at Hillsdale, McDonald has scored 936 points, grabbed 446 rebounds, dished out 216 assists, and grabbed 124 steals in just 57 starts for the Chargers. She surpassed 1,000 points for her collegiate career including her 172 points as a freshman at Air Force during a Feb. 8 game at Kentucky Wesleyan.For Splain, meanwhile, this first-team recognition is a well-earned first all-conference honor that caps a tremendous four-year career at Hillsdale for the 5-foot-8 guard. The senior put up career highs across the board, finishing second on the team in scoring with 13.2 points per game while also averaging 4.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.3 steals. Long known as a feared shooter from range, Splain showcased all aspects of a well-rounded game as a senior, and played her best in the biggest moments of the season for the Chargers, including 16 fourth-quarter points to lead Hillsdale to a 68-57 rivalry win on the road over Findlay on Feb. 20.Splain came to Hillsdale as an overlooked walk-on recruit from Olentangy Liberty High School near Columbus, Ohio, but quickly proved to be far more than her pedigree as she built up a record-setting career for the Chargers. On January 30, against Cedarville at home, Splain became the 21player in Hillsdale College history to surpass 1,000 points for her career, and she currently ranks 15on the all-time list with 1,145 points.Just two weeks later, in a Feb. 15 contest against Northwood, she broke Hillsdale's career made 3-pointers record, and now has 248 entering this weekend, 11 ahead of second place at Hillsdale and third in G-MAC history. Her 66 made 3-pointers so far in 2024-25 rank seventh in Hillsdale history for a single season and give her three of the top 10 all-time marks in made 3-pointers in program history.McDonald and Splain will look to help Hillsdale reach the G-MAC Tournament title game for the first time since 2018 in a semifinal matchup at 7:30 p.m. Friday against Malone at Ashland University. A victory would see the Chargers playing in the championship game on Saturday at 3 p.m.",

That data can include predictions about when kitchen equipment like fryers or infamously faulty ice cream machines will break down. Edge computing can also be used for AI-powered communication for the drive-through.\n\nAccording to Rice, McDonald\u2019s is exploring using computer vision, the form of AI used for facial recognition by TSA in airports. This technology would be used in cameras to \u201cdetermine whether orders are accurate before they\u2019re handed to customers,\u201d per WSJ.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is implementing these technology initiatives to grow the number of customers from 175 million to 250 million by 2027.\n\nWhile the AI news might not satisfy anyone\u2019s hunger, the chain restaurant launched a celebrity-driven breakfast campaign on Monday, March 3.\n\nJust one day after the 97th Academy Awards, McDonald's dropped a new commercial that spotlights Oscar-nominated actors and other attendees' go-to breakfast items.\n\n\"There's only one meal Hollywood relies on,\" the commercial declares, as order receipts featuring meals for Michael B.

Though this is a fairly simple order, a content creator testing this trick did observe that a small fries is no bargain these days since fast food has gotten so expensive (ordering it as a combo meal might help).\n\nAll you really need to do is layer hot, crispy french fries on top of the fish patty, and you've got a salty, umami, potato-sweet approximation of fish and chips ... on a bun. It's even served in a paper wrapper like classic British fish and chips, and McDonald's uses pollock, one of several fish commonly served as fish and chips.\n\nThere are a couple of tweaks you can make if you want to get even closer to the taste of classic fish and chips, long a defining street food in Britain. First, ask for no cheese or tartar sauce (though honestly both work pretty well here, and the tartar sauce holds the fries in place). Second, bring a packet or bottle of malt vinegar or Original HP sauce (also known as brown sauce). Both are considered traditional condiments with fish and chips (note that the vinegar might drip).

What they don't tell you about getting older is the little reminders along the way. Everyone is ready for the sports stars to be much younger than you and your high school friends having kids, but your hometown McDonald's closing? That fucks you up man. You start to hear the clock ticking.\n\nUnfortunately, McDonald's taking down the playscapes makes sense. They were, most likely, insurance nightmares for the company. Parents through the years started to realize how disgusting it is to let the kids play inside of them, which then led to corporate slowly seeing the space taken up by the multi-colored playscape as an absolute waste. To have them replaced by screens is a dagger to the heart. I may be a nostalgia merchant bringing up what McDonald's playscapes, but I think most would agree that kids running around is better than them plopped in front of a screen.\n\nMy biggest takeaway from all of this is big screen has won. They have defeated us. Our society is helplessly addicted to screens and it starts at a young age. This is yet another sad example.\n\nThe world we grew up in doesn't exist anymore.\n\n\n\n",

The city\u2019s Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) outlines best management practices to mitigate environmental harm, such as algae blooms and fish kills caused by excess nutrients and pollutants.\n\nBlack highlighted ongoing initiatives, including the city\u2019s rain barrel program, catch basin adoption efforts, and public education campaigns to reduce salt usage and properly dispose of pet waste. Residents can access resources and handouts at City Center to learn more about reducing stormwater runoff.\n\nHVAC system upgrades approved\n\nThe council unanimously approved a $11,140 bid from ARI Mechanical, in partnership with Foster Mechanical, to upgrade the controls for the Glencoe Police Department\u2019s HVAC system. The project includes low-voltage reconnections and replaces outdated equipment to improve efficiency. A second bid from UHL of Maple Grove was significantly higher due to additional communication equipment requirements.\n\nEasements and land\n\npurchase for Hennepin Avenue project\n\nThe council also approved the purchase of a three-acre parcel from Glencoe Regional Health Services for $36,000 to construct a stormwater holding pond as part of the Hennepin Avenue reconstruction project.

            "content": "Jennifer Crumbley wants prosecutor removed from her case: 'She cannot be trusted'\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Oakland County Prosecutor speaks after James Crumbley found guilty Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald spoke to the media after James Crumbley was found guilty on four counts of involuntary manslaughter\n\nJennifer Crumbley doesn't just want a new trial, she's now seeking to have Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald and her office removed from her case, alleging McDonald has crossed multiple ethical and legal lines in handling her historic prosecution.\n\nAs part of this request, Crumbley's new lawyer disclosed new information Wednesday about the prosecutor's office: It paid nearly $36,000 to a public relations firm for one week of work after the Nov. 30, 2021, Oxford High School shooting \u2014 including setting up 40 one-on-one interviews with national media outlets \u2014 and is still paying a second PR firm $1,440 a month to monitor the news media, according to invoices listed in a Wednesday court filing.\n\nAppellate attorney Michael Dezsi alleges these PR firms, including social media influencers, were used to run a \"smear campaign\" against Jennifer and James Crumbley, the first parents in America to be held responsible for a mass school shooting committed by their child.\n\nMore: Like his wife, James Crumbley asks for new trial: Prosecution kept evidence from me, too\n\n\"The Oakland County Prosecutor has demonstrated that she cannot be trusted to prosecute this case consistent with the constitutional, legal, and ethical duties imposed upon her office,\" Dezsi, argues in the new filing. \"Since the inception of this case, the prosecutor has violated the court rules, entered into secret agreements with two star prosecution witnesses, and has unethically engaged two public relations firms to run a smear campaign against the Crumbleys in an effort to sway public opinion and taint the jury pool.\"\n\n\"For these reasons,\" Dezsi continues, \"the prosecutor, and her entire office, should be removed from any and all further proceedings in this case.\"\n\nProsecutor calls defense 'ludicrous' \u2014 'I stand by the work we did'\n\nIn a statement late Wednesday, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald called the defense's request \"not legally proper,\" and lambasted Crumbley's lawyer over his filing.\n\n\"It\u2019s disrespectful to the victims, their families, and the people in the community,\" McDonald stated, adding the defense also disrespected the court system, jury and her prosecution team. \"I stand by the work we did.\"\n\nShe continued:\n\n\u201cThe suggestion of a smear campaign is ludicrous. The crisis communications firms fielded an overwhelming number of media inquiries, not drumming up coverage. And their work was not secret. They were hired with the approval of the County Executive and the Board of Commissioners, and they interacted with the media on a daily basis.\"\n\nMcDonald called Dezsi's motion \"nothing more than a desperate attempt to divert attention from Jennifer Crumbley herself.\"\n\n\u201cJennifer Crumbley was convicted by a jury, not the media. And she was convicted for what she did and didn\u2019t do,\" McDonald stated, reiterating the themes from trial: that Crumbley \"boasted\" about buying her son a handgun and taking him to the shooting range, \"while ignoring her son\u2019s pleas for help and all the signs that he was struggling, and then leaving the gun where he could access it.\"\n\nPerhaps most egregious, McDonald maintains, is that \"Jennifer Crumbley told the jury that she wouldn\u2019t have changed a thing. We didn\u2019t need a smear campaign to convict Jennifer Crumbley. Her own actions and words were more than enough.\"\n\nSteve St. Juliana, whose 14-year-old daughter Hana died in the shooting, also scoffed at Dezsi's claims, saying in a statement: \"Stop trying to make [Jennifer Crumbley] the victim. My daughter is the one that was murdered because of her negligence.\u201d\n\nOakland County Executive Dave Coulter also jumped to McDonald's defense, saying in another statement: \u201cIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting, my administration and the Board of Commissioners moved quickly to provide the Prosecutor with the appropriate support she and her office needed to keep the public informed and to prosecute the case \u2014 including $500,000 for communications, information technology, security and other related costs.\u201d\n\nNew request comes as judge prepares to make crucial decision\n\nDezsi's filing comes as Oakland County Circuit Judge Cheryl Matthews prepares to issue a decision on whether to give Jennifer Crumbley a new trial on alleged prosecutorial misconduct grounds.\n\nAt issue is whether the prosecution unlawfully withheld from the defense proffer agreements that it reached with two key school witnesses who were promised early on that their statements to investigators would not be used against them, and who later testified against Crumbley at her trial.\n\nThe agreements were first disclosed by the Free Press last March, after both Crumbleys were convicted in separate trials.\n\nDezsi has argued that those agreements should have been provided to Crumbley's legal team before trial, which would have allowed the defense to argue to jurors that the school witnesses were under the threat of prosecution themselves, and therefore not credible. Under the agreements, the witnesses were offered some assurances that they would not be prosecuted over statements they provided investigators, but the jury never got to hear that, Dezsi said.\n\nThe prosecution has argued that it was under no obligation to provide the proffer agreements to the defense because, it maintains, no immunity was provided. The prosecution also urged the judge to deny Crumbley's request for a new trial, arguing she was convicted fairly over her own actions and inactions that, prosecutors stress, cost four students their lives.\n\n\"She was the cause of these four deaths ... nobody else judge, her,\" Assistant Prosecutor Marc Keast has argued in court, referring to the four students who were killed in the Oxford shooting: Hana St. Juliana, 14; Madisyn Baldwin, 17; Tate Myre, 16, and Justin Shilling, 17. Six other students and a teacher also were injured.\n\nThe prosecution also has defended its use of the two PR firms hired after the shooting, maintaining it needed help handling the media in a case of this magnitude, noting it did not have a PR person on staff to handle such matters.\n\nShooting victim's parent: I can't go through this again\n\nCraig Shilling, whose son Justin was killed in the Oxford High School massacre, struggles with the news that the Crumbleys are asking for a new trial.\n\n\"It's kind of a slap in the face,\" Shilling said. \"I still stand strong with the fact that they could have done something more. Regardless of how they perceive the trial went. ... Overall, I feel that justice was served. ... I just feel that they dropped the ball 100% as far as their child was concerned, and I don\u2019t think they did everything they could to protect the community.\"\n\nRegarding the Crumbley's son, who committed the shootings, Shilling said: \"He could have snapped on anybody.\"\n\nDespite his pain and loss, however, Shilling said he understands that the justice system needs to be fair, and that he has \"strong and mixed emotions\" about the trial.\n\n\"I'm not necessarily 100% clear on the trial,\" Shilling said, noting he still is frustrated and upset that no school officials were ever charged or held responsible. But if the judge determines the Crumbleys didn't get a fair trial and orders new ones, he said that he understands.\n\n\"It has to be fair, and it has to be by (the) law,\" Shilling said of the Crumbley prosecutions. \"It sucks to say that in the position that I\u2019m in, but I don\u2019t want anybody to break a law to have it happen.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I have my firm belief in what should happen. ... I have to be fair. I try and keep an open mind on stuff, even hard stuff.\"\n\nStill, he stressed: \"I personally wouldn\u2019t want to go through it again, it was hard enough the first time.\"\n\nDefense: Prosecution spent $150,000 to two PR firms, at taxpayer expense\n\nAccording to court records and public documents obtained by the Free Press, the prosecutor's office spent more than $150,000 on two PR firms since the school shooting.\n\nThe first was a national crisis response firm called Identity, which states on its website that it was hired by the prosecutor's office \"in the hours following\" the tragedy to \"manage the media,\" and that it mobilized a \"team of media and social media strategists who would spend the next eight days providing counsel\" and responding to media requests worldwide.\n\nThese eight days of work cost taxpayers $35,839.25, according to documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. This is what Identity billed to manage more than 75 news media interviews for the prosecutor's office in one week, including 40 one-on-one interviews with national media outlets: Identity's hourly rate for its services ranged from $175 an hour to $300 an hour, the latter of which was paid to the company's president and managing partner, who together received $9,000 for 49 hours of work.\n\nThe second PR firm hired after the shooting was Moment Strategies, which is owned by former Detroit journalist Alexis Wiley, who, to date, has made about $120,000 doing PR work for the prosecutor's office. Wiley's latest $1,440 invoice for \"daily media monitoring\" went out on Feb. 1, with a March 3 due date.\n\n\"That is the last one,\" Wiley told the Free Press on Monday, noting that the prosecutor's office hired a full-time spokesperson in early January, so her services will no longer be needed.\n\nAccording to Wiley, \"daily media monitoring\" involves notifying the prosecutor's office of any media reports \u2014 including newspaper and TV \u2014 that mention any criminal cases being handled by the prosecutor's office. She also defended her work, maintaining that in the wake of the shooting, the prosecutor's office had no PR person on staff who could handle the monumental case. She also has denied allegations that she was part of any \"smear campaign,\" as alleged by the defense.\n\n\"The prosecutor's office had no communication support,\" Wiley said. \"We provided that support at a fraction of the cost that it would be to hire someone in-house full-time. We did our work with integrity.\"\n\nDefense: Prosecutor turned her office 'into makeshift Hollywood film set'\n\nDezsi, meanwhile, also takes issue with a Hulu documentary that aired about the Crumbleys nine days after James Crumbley was convicted. The executive producer of this documentary had family ties to Chief Assistant Prosecutor David Williams \u2014 she was his wife's cousin \u2014 and had inside access to the prosecutor's office for two years as it built its historic case against the Crumbleys.\n\nMore: Judge raises concerns about prosecutor's handling of Jennifer Crumbley case\n\n\"The Prosecutor also turned her office into a make-shift Hollywood film set,\" Dezsi argues in his court filing, referring to the ABC news crew that filmed the documentary, and was allowed into \"closed-door strategy meetings.\"\n\nDezsi also takes issue with the prosecutor's office granting behind-the-scenes access to a Washington Post reporter \"for the purpose of documenting the progress of the prosecutions related to the Oxford High School shooting.\u201d\n\nDefense: Here's how prosecution violated Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, Dezsi zeroed in on the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct \u2014 which has a special section titled \u201cResponsibilities of a Prosecutor\u201d \u2014 alleging the Oakland County Prosecutor\u2019s Office violated these ethical codes of conduct in two ways:\n\nFirst, by withholding from the defense the proffer agreements that it brokered with two key school witnesses who testified against the Crumbleys. That\u2019s a violation, Dezsi alleged, of Section 3.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which says a prosecutor has a duty to \u201cmake timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor\u201d that may be favorable to the defense.\n\n\u201cThey have just outright lied about their obligation and duty to produce those proffer agreements to the defense,\u201d Dezsi said, stressing that had the jurors known about those agreements, \u201cthey certainly could have reached a different outcome in the case.\u201d\n\nThe second prosecutorial violation of the state\u2019s rules, Dezsi said, involved the prosecutor using taxpayer funds to hire two public relations firms that he alleges engaged in a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against the Crumbleys and tainted the jury pool. One of those firms, Identity, received nearly $36,000 for one week\u2019s worth of work alone \u2014 an amount that was approved by Chief Assistant Prosecutor David Williams, according to invoices filed in court.\n\n\u201cWhy is that important?\u201d Dezsi said. \u201cBecause the prosecutor's office has publicly said a few things that are false.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Dezsi said, the prosecution has maintained that Oakland County approved these PR contracts, but he alleged \u201cthat\u2019s not what happened.\u201d\n\nDefense: Prosecutor asked for $1 million to prosecute the Crumbleys\n\n\u201cThe Oakland County prosecutor asked for a million dollars from Oakland County to prosecute (the Crumbley) cases. A million dollars. Think about that. A million dollars put into a case to prosecute a couple from the community with very little resources. They didn't stand a chance. This is how they created an unequal playing field. They did it by use of these public relations firms that serve the purpose of spinning the narrative in favor of what the prosecutors wanted to have heard by the public.\u201d\n\nDezsi alleges that not only is the use of PR firms by prosecutors \u201cout of the ordinary or abnormal. It is unethical.\u201d He said the Rules of Professional Conduct prohibit lawyers from using outside agents or public relations firms to do or say things that they themselves could not do or say \u2014 such as statements about the character or reputation of a party in the case that could prejudice them.\n\n\u201cAnd this is where you can look at it in a finer light to see what exactly the prosecutor did to publish and push a negative narrative about the Crumbleys,\u201d Dezsi said.\n\nTo bolster his argument, Dezsi said he wants access to six reports that a PR firm called Identity put together in which it summarized all the press coverage and digital discussions. Dezsi said he has asked the judge to give him subpoena power that would help him get the reports.\n\n\u201cI intend to get them,\u201d Dezsi said. \u201cBecause what I believe we're going to find is that these PR firms were telling the prosecutor's office what points were the most negative, what points were being repeated the most often in \u2026 the social media sphere, so that they could then focus and refocus their narrative and their talking points about the Crumbleys leading up til the trial.\u201d\n\nJennifer Crumbley, along with her husband, James Crumbley, were convicted at separate jury trials of involuntary manslaughter for the deaths of four students killed by their son in the rampage at Oxford High School. The jury concluded the parents gave their minor son access to a gun and failed to secure it properly, which allowed him to sneak it out of the house and kill his classmates.\n\nThe shooter, who was 15 at the time, pleaded guilty to all of his crimes and is serving a life-without-parole sentence.\n\nAll three Crumbleys are appealing.\n\nAt a hearing related to Jennifer Crumbley's appeal in January, Judge Matthews expressed concern with the prosecution's actions involving the proffer agreements, saying: \"Didn't the prosecution tack too close to the wind?\" She also stressed that her job at hand was to determine whether the courts and public now lack confidence in the verdict \u2014 not whether the outcome would have been different had Crumbley had access to these proffer agreements.\n\n(Editor's note: This story was updated with additional comments)\n\nContact Tresa Baldas: tbaldas@freepress.com",

            "content": "ZERO SUM: The Arc of International Business in Russia, by Charles Hecker\n\nPerhaps nothing better captures the optimism that accompanied the last days of the Soviet Union than the opening of a McDonald\u2019s in Moscow, in January of 1990. Tens of thousands of Russians applied to work at the restaurant, and tens of thousands more stood in line for hours to get their first taste of a Big Mac. On an adjacent building, the company had affixed its golden arches, above a much smaller display of the moribund empire\u2019s red hammer-and-sickle flag. As a 4-year-old, I was among the many Muscovite children whose first encounter with American culture transpired over a Happy Meal.\n\nAnd yet nothing gold can stay. The restaurant is still serving fries and shakes on Pushkin Square, but, as of mid-2022, it is under local ownership and rebranded as Vkusno i Tochka \u2014 Russian for \u201cTasty, Period.\u201d\n\nNot every Western company left the country after the Russian president Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but sanctions, and the reputational cost of remaining, triggered an exodus. In \u201cZero Sum,\u201d Charles Hecker chronicles this period, from the frenzied first moments of corporate investment in the midst of Soviet collapse to the run on business-class tickets that attended the scramble out of Moscow as Putin pressed in on Kyiv.\n\n\u201cZero Sum\u201d is a smart, often colorful book, enlivened by the grim smirk of someone who has intimate knowledge of how the everyday Russian economy really works. Hecker witnessed most of the three-decade saga up close, as a reporter for The Moscow Times and then as a geopolitical risk consultant advising Americans and Europeans investing in Russia. He arrived from Miami in the mid-90s, on the heels of what Harvard Business Review lauded as \u201ca liberal-market revolution.\u201d",

She loved spending time with her family and friends, attending her grandchildren\u2019s sporting events, spending summers in Hampton Beach, and bowling into her 90\u2019s, but her favorite hobby was shopping. She enjoyed traveling well into her 80\u2019s and toured extensively through North America and Europe and sailed on several trans-Atlantic and Caribbean cruises.

Workers at the restaurant said they\u2019ve called police in the past over Clemons\u2019 behavior, documents stated.\n\nSaturday, charging documents said Clemons refused to leave the McDonald\u2019s and threatened to expose himself to an employee who asked him to leave the restaurant. The worker then asked Francois, a security guard at the McDonald\u2019s, for help.\n\nFootage from the restaurant shows Francois told Clemons to leave, then deployed pepper spray in Clemons\u2019 face while Clemons was sitting at a table. According to video footage, Francois drew his baton after Clemons turned toward him. Clemons then lied on the floor.\n\nAs Francois was seen using his phone, Clemons got up and approached Francois, who exited the restaurant. Clemons returned to his booth, according to footage cited in court documents.\n\nFrancois reentered the McDonald\u2019s and started giving Clemons commands, the documents stated, adding once Clemons tried to stand up, Francois pushed him down with his baton multiple times.\n\nClemons then grabbed Francois\u2019 baton and a struggle ensued, during which Francois pulled his gun. Francois regained control of the baton and holstered his firearm.\n\nClemons turned his back to Francois, who then struck Clemons in the back with his baton, sparking another struggle, during which the two men exchanged blows, according to charging documents.\n\nFrancois dropped his baton after being punched in the head during the fight, then pulled his gun and fired a shot toward Clemons, striking him in the chest, the documents stated.\n\nPolice said Clemons was not armed and that Francois is an armed security guard for Strategic Security Corp., who has a permit to carry a firearm.\n\nPrince George\u2019s County police said Francois\u2019 actions initiated the entire physical encounter, and said witness statements and footage also justified the murder charge.\n\nFrancois was ordered held without bond Monday and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing April 1.\n\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\n\u00a9 2025 WTOP.

            "content": "With a site now in hand for a years-in-the-making downtown lodging center, Ronald McDonald House Charities of Richmond is lining up the cash needed to build the project.\n\nThe local nonprofit, which provides lodging and hospitality services to the families of hospitalized children, is underway on a $40 million fundraising effort for a 50-room facility that would be built at 505 W. Leigh St., near the Belvidere Street interchange with Interstate 64.\n\nThere would be lounges, reading rooms, playrooms and community meeting rooms in the 52,000-square-foot, three-story building, as well as a kitchen and dining hall. There would also be outdoor play areas for kids. The center is designed to serve as a temporary home base for families to stay while their children undergo medical treatment in local hospitals.\n\n\u201cMany of them are in critical situations and they need a place to relax, get away, get a cup of coffee and do their laundry. If the families are near the children, the outcomes are better,\u201d said Mike DeRuosi, the chairman of RHMC Richmond\u2019s board of directors.\n\nRHMC planned to hold a news conference at 11 a.m. Wednesday on the site of the future facility to formally announce the project and start of the fundraising drive\u2019s \u201cpublic phase,\u201d when the group will solicit funding support from the wider community, following outreach to major donors.\n\nThe campaign has secured a little over $15 million in commitments during the preceding \u201cquiet phase\u201d as of Tuesday afternoon, according to its website.\n\nThe project to build the new lodging center comes in response to growing demand for pediatric medical care in the region. RMHC estimates that the region needs 54 to 65 rooms based on the discharge data at Richmond-area pediatric hospitals.\n\nThe project would bring it more in sync with demand, which it can\u2019t accommodate with its current 15 beds spread across its main lodging facility on Monument Avenue, Bon Secours St. Mary\u2019s Hospital and The Children\u2019s Hospital of Richmond at VCU. Families stay an average of eight days per visit.\n\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s a growing demand and need,\u201d RHMC Richmond CEO Emily Toalson said. \u201cWe\u2019re not equipped to support that right now with a nine-room house (on Monument), and even with those other programs\u2026the sleep rooms don\u2019t match the discharge data.\u201d\n\nThat demand is likely to continue to grow, Toalson said, citing plans by VCU Health to further expand its operations at its downtown pediatrics hospital, following the completion of a $420 million expansion in 2023. Bon Secours is also planning an expansion at St. Mary\u2019s with an emphasis on pediatric care.\n\nRMHC\u2019s Leigh Street facility is expected to open in early 2027. The project is slated to break ground late this year or early next year.\n\nThe project is currently expected to cost around $37 million or $38 million, Toalson said, and the capital campaign would be fully devoted to the project. RMHC previously pegged the project at nearly $33 million. The increase is due to higher anticipated construction costs.\n\nDPR is the project\u2019s general contractor, and SMBW is designing the project.\n\nThe project is slated to rise on a 1.6-acre property at the corner of West Leigh and Brook Road, across the street from Abner Clay Park. RMHC bought the land for $4 million in December from the VCU Real Estate Foundation.\n\nJohn Kemper, the project manager and a donor to RMHC, said that over the years the organization looked at different properties for the center, including the one where it ultimately ended up. Kemper said the Leigh Street property has space for further expansion.\n\n\u201cWe looked at this site way back when, but VCU decided they needed to retain it at that point. We came back around to that a couple years ago. And the beauty of it is it gives us unlimited expansion capability, so that if the children\u2019s hospital continues to grow, which everybody thinks it will, we\u2019ve got plenty of room,\u201d he said.\n\nRMHC\u2019s project site was sliced off a larger 2.6-acre parcel owned by the university\u2019s real estate arm. Kemper said the nonprofit has first right of refusal on the rest of the block, which is now a grassy lot, formerly the site of Belvidere Medical Center.\n\nThe project needs a conditional use permit approval from City Council. Kemper said he anticipated the organization\u2019s request would be heard by council members in May.\n\nRMHC had previously planned to open a larger facility as part of VCU Health\u2019s now-abandoned plans to redevelop the site of the former Public Safety Building in downtown Richmond.\n\nPlans to open the new facility in Jackson Ward come amid the expansion of RMHC\u2019s local operations in recent years. The organization in 2023 opened a four-bedroom center at VCU Health\u2019s downtown pediatric hospital. At St. Mary\u2019s, RMHC has a two-bedroom center. Last year, RMHC expanded into Southside with hospitality services at Johnston-Willis Hospital and St. Francis Medical Center.\n\nThe Richmond arm of RMHC opened its lodging center at 2330 Monument Ave. in 1980. The nonprofit plans to close that center, and sell the property, as part of the expansion project.\n\nThe local arm of the nonprofit, which has chapters in multiple states, has nearly 30 employees. RMHC isn\u2019t owned by McDonald\u2019s, though the restaurant chain is the nonprofit\u2019s largest corporate partner.",

He commented in a video posted to his Instagram account last week.\n\n\"I love to sit with the team and make predictions about what we think is going to come in the year ahead,\" he said.\n\nOf the three things Kempczinski talked about, one major trend focuses not on what's in your bun, but what's next to it:\n\nMcDonald's CEO predicts that diners will want more protein\n\n\"Protein is hot,\" Kempczinski said in his first prediction.\n\nMany diners are looking to add protein to their diet, especially those trying to lose weight. People who are taking GLP-1 weight loss medications such as Ozempic often look for low-fat sources of protein, for instance.\n\nMcDonald's already serves several kinds of protein, from burgers to chicken sandwiches to the Filet-O-Fish, meaning that the chain is well-positioned to serve those customers, Kempczinski said in the video.\n\nKempczinski says fast-food restaurants will continue looking at AI\n\nFast food chains have spent years experimenting with AI. Some are moving ahead with bigger rollouts, such as using voice AI to take customers' orders at drive-thru lanes.\n\nMcDonald's pulled its own voice-AI ordering system from drive-thrus last year. But Kempczinski predicted that chains \u2014 including his own \u2014 will keep experimenting.\n\n\"We've got a number of teams looking at how we can use AI,\" Kempczinski said.\n\nSauces will be a focus for diners in 2025, Kempczinski says\n\nOne big theme in 2025 won't be about what's in the center of diners' plates but what kind of sauces they're using, Kempczinski said.\n\n\"Spicy is always in,\" he said. \"I think you might see some honey or some sweet stuff.\"\n\nMcDonald's has gotten patrons excited about sauces before. In 2017, it brought back a limited amount of Szechuan McNugget sauce, first released in tandem with the Disney movie \"Mulan\" in the 1990s, after the animated series \"Rick and Morty\" referenced the sauce in an episode.\n\nDo you have a story to share about working in the fast food industry?

The actor\u2019s go-to breakfast? Two Egg McMuffins, two hash browns, and a single strawberry preserve cup. While it might seem like a simple morning meal, this order delivers a solid dose of protein\u2014clocking in at 38 grams in total.\n\nProtein is key for someone like Jordan, who likely follows a rigorous fitness routine to maintain his action-hero physique. It supports muscle repair, sustains energy and helps keep you full throughout the day. But while his order is high in protein, it also comes with some nutritional red flags worth considering.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s break down the numbers. Here\u2019s the full nutritional profile of Jordan\u2019s McDonald\u2019s breakfast:\n\n940 calories\n\n38g protein\n\n42g fat\n\n14g saturated fat\n\n2,160mg sodium\n\n106g carbohydrates\n\n15g total sugar\n\n8g fiber\n\nThe protein count is impressive, but the sodium and saturated fat numbers are tough to ignore. EatingWell recommends keeping meals under 4 grams of saturated fat and 600 milligrams of sodium for optimal heart health. That means Jordan\u2019s breakfast packs over triple the recommended saturated fat and three times the sodium recommendation. While his active lifestyle might help counteract some of the effects, regularly consuming meals high in sodium and fat can be problematic for the average person.\n\n\n\nWhy does this matter? Excess saturated fat can raise cholesterol levels, increasing the risk of heart disease. High sodium intake, for its part, is linked to elevated blood pressure, which can strain the heart over time. While an occasional salty meal is perfectly fine, relying on meals like this too often could have long-term health consequences.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you have to skip out on your McDonald\u2019s favorites entirely. If you want to enjoy a breakfast inspired by Jordan\u2019s order but with a healthier balance, consider making a few swaps. Opt for just one Egg McMuffin instead of two, and swap apple slices for one of the hash browns for added fiber and nutrients. You can also skip the strawberry preserve or choose a lower-sugar alternative. These small tweaks can help you enjoy a protein-packed meal without getting ahead of yourself on sodium or fat.\n\nJordan\u2019s McDonald\u2019s order delivers on protein, but for most of us, balance is key. Pairing protein with nutrient-rich sides like fruit, whole grains and healthy fats can help fuel your morning while keeping your heart health in check. That\u2019s why we love opting for quick, balanced bites like our Cottage Cheese Toast for busy mornings when we don\u2019t even have time to swing by McDonald\u2019s.\n\nEven Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars know the importance of a good breakfast\u2014just make sure yours works for your own health goals.\n\n",

            "content": "Proposed revisions to the McDonald criteria, a set of diagnostic guidelines for multiple sclerosis (MS), may help diagnose people who could have been missed under earlier versions, according to a recent analysis.\n\nThat includes people with radiological-only onset, when there are signs of disease on MRI scans but no obvious neurological symptoms, as well as individuals with atypical clinical presentations not specific for MS.\n\nThe analysis showed that nearly one in five such individuals in a clinical study met the new criteria for an MS diagnosis.\n\nAlexandra Scharf, a medical student at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, presented the findings at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2025, held Feb. 27-March 1 in Florida and virtually.\n\nScharf conducted the research at the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research. Her talk was titled, \u201cApplication of 2024 McDonald Criteria to Individuals with Atypical and Radiological Only Presentations in a Multicenter Diagnostic Biomarker Study.\u201d\n\nRecommended Reading My nearly 20-year journey to get my diagnosis of MS\n\nBeyond clinical signs\n\nThe McDonald criteria, developed in 2001, take into account clinical, laboratory, and MRI findings to help hone in on an MS diagnosis. Across several revisions over time, the guidelines have indicated that a person must show classic clinical signs of disease to have their diagnosis confirmed.\n\n\u201cPrevious revisions of the McDonald Criteria have not allowed a diagnosis of MS in the absence of a typical clinical attack or neurological progression,\u201d Scharf said.\n\nPeople who have lesions, areas of damage seen on an MRI scan consistent with MS, but no overt clinical symptoms would have been diagnosed with radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS). That could mean that patients with atypical clinical presentations not specific for MS would be missed.\n\nLast year, a group of experts proposed revisions to the guidelines that would allow such individuals to be diagnosed with MS provided they met certain other criteria.\n\nUnder these revisions, an MS diagnosis can be made if there\u2019s evidence of dissemination in space (DIS), meaning that neurological damage occurs in at least two different locations in the nervous system, and at least one of three other criteria are met.\n\nThese include dissemination in time (DIT), when neurological damage occurs at more than one point in time; evidence that antibodies related to MS are present in the spinal fluid (oligoclonal bands or kappa free light chains); or at least six lesions with the central vein sign (CVS), an MRI finding believed to be specific for MS in which a small vein appears running through a lesion.\n\nScharf applied the proposed 2024 McDonald criteria revisions to a subset of participants from the CAVS-MS study (NCT04495556).\n\nCAVS-MS was designed to assess whether CVS could be used as a reliable MS biomarker. It recruited 420 people who were referred to MS centers in the U.S. for a diagnostic evaluation and underwent MRI scans at their first study visit (baseline) and over a two-year period.\n\nScharf\u2019s analysis focused on data from the baseline visits of 191 participants who presented with atypical clinical onset (166 people) or who had radiological-only onset (25 people), whose diagnosis could be missed under previous versions of the criteria.\n\nOverall, 36 participants (19%) met the 2024 McDonald Criteria, 32% with radiological-only onset and 17% with atypical clinical onset.\n\n\u201cNearly one in five participants with atypical or radiological-only presentation met diagnostic criteria for MS under the 2024 revisions,\u201d Scharf said.\n\nOf these 36 people, seven met the criteria because they showed evidence of DIS and DIT. Of the remaining 29 people, who all met DIS criteria, 19 were CVS-positive, 15 had oligoclonal bands, and five had both.\n\nUltimately, 43% of people with DIS but not DIT could have their diagnosis confirmed based on the presence of CVS.\n\n\u201cUnder the 2024 revisions, the central vein sign is among the most useful paraclinical tools\u201d to establish a diagnosis in people with atypical or no clinical signs of disease, Scharf said.\n\nAmong people who met DIS, more than half (55%) had a diagnosis confirmed based on the presence of one other diagnostic criteria: CVS, oligoclonal bands, or DIT. It was much less common for patients to meet more than one additional criterion.\n\n\u201cFurther study and long-term follow-up is required to validate diagnostic accuracy in this patient population,\u201d Scharf said, noting that such analyses are planned through the CAVS-MS study.\n\nThe National Multiple Sclerosis Society and the National Institutes of Health were among funding sources for the study.",

Guarino, age 93 of Lynnfield, passed away on Monday, March 3 at the Kaplan Hospice House in Danvers.\n\nShe was born in Boston on January 11, 1932 and was the daughter of the late Anthony and Augustina LoGiudice.\n\nAnne lived her childhood and early adult years in the West End of Boston. She graduated High School from the Washington School and proudly told everyone that through her 12 years of school that she never missed a single day. After high school she attended secretarial school and took her first secretarial job at a law firm in Boston. After her marriage to her husband Frank in 1956 and having children she was a stay home mom, they moved to Lynnfield to her first and only house on Gerry Road, living there for 66 years. Anne did go back to secretarial work in 1972 working at the Lynnfield Junior High School; she was the friendly face in the front office for all of the students and was affectionately known as Mrs. G. After her retirement in 1992 she and her husband spent 20 years of wintering in Florida where they enjoyed daily walks and often golfing. Anne was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother and friend who was always available for a cup of coffee and some chit chat. She was an avid book reader often completing a book a week. Anne was deeply religious, always saying prayers for everyone and never missing weekly mass and in her later years when she couldn\u2019t get to church she\u2019d watch mass on her television.\n\nShe was the beloved wife of the late Frank Guarino Jr. She was the loving mother of Carol Chiuve and her husband Frederick of Lynnfield, and Frank Guarino III and his wife Carolyn of Marshfield. She was the sister of the late Joseph and Vincent LoGiudice, and Carmella DeGregoro. She is also survived by grandchildren Janelle Mattingly and her husband Tyler, Eric Chiuve, Josie Ettridge and her husband Dylan, and Frankie Guarino.\n\nHer Funeral Mass will be celebrated in Our Lady of the Assumption Church, 17 Grove Street, Lynnfield on Tuesday March 11 at 11:30 a.m. Visitation for relatives and friends will be held at the McDonald Funeral Home, 19 Yale Ave., Wakefield on Tuesday prior to the Mass from 9:00 a.m.\u2013 11:00 a.m. Interment, Forest Hill Cemetery, Lynnfield.\n\n\n\n",

On Monday afternoon, the senior was named G-MAC Women's Basketball Player of the Week for her performance.In a season-ending battle between two of the top three teams in the G-MAC for sole possession of the runner-up spot and the second-seed in this week's G-MAC Tournament, McDonald was the best player on the floor, scoring 30 of Hillsdale's 68 points in a 68-61 win at Malone, and adding in 10 rebounds for a double-double. The senior from Chicago started hot, helping Hillsdale jump out to a 20-10 lead with 11 first quarter points, and never let up, carrying the Chargers through dry spells and finishing off the win with 10 fourth-quarter points, including going 4 for 4 from the line in the final 30 seconds to end any chance of a Pioneers comeback.The game was emblematic of a do-everything season for McDonald, who will be a strong candidate for G-MAC Player of the Year honors. She's the only player to rank in the top six in the G-MAC in points per game (15.1, 4th), rebounds (7.0, 6th), assists (3.5, T-2nd), and steals (2.1, 2nd) while also ranking in the top 10 in the conference in field goal percentage and free throw percentage. In just two and a half seasons at Hillsdale after transferring from the Air Force Academy, McDonald has 927 points, 441 rebounds, 210 assists and 124 steals while leading the Chargers to three G-MAC Tourney appearances after a three-year drought and, as a senior in 2024-25, their best regular-season and conference finish in 16 years.McDonald and the Chargers begin their G-MAC Tourney run at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, with a home contest against seventh-seeded Cedarville. Hillsdale will look to make a run for its first G-MAC Tournament title since 2017-18, and also, potentially, put itself in position to secure an at-large bid to the NCAA DII Tournament with multiple wins in the tourney.Photo by",

            "content": "For several years, this McDonald\u2019s in Northwest Washington was the primary source of Diana Portillo\u2019s torment. It\u2019s where Portillo, who is trans, says she was openly mocked by her co-workers and bosses who refused to use her chosen name. It\u2019s where she said she remembers feeling humiliated after she was loudly reprimanded by a manager for using the women\u2019s bathroom. And it\u2019s where she says multiple complaints she made alleging discrimination were ignored or dismissed, up until the day she was fired.\n\nBut when Portillo peered inside McDonald\u2019s store #695 on a recent afternoon, she was more conflicted than angry.\n\n\u201cThis was the first job I had in Washington; it was the first job where I liked working there,\u201d Portillo, 44, told The Washington Post through a translator. \u201cBut everything that came later, after my transition, caused a lot of bad memories.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPortillo filed an employment discrimination suit against International Golden Foods, the company that operates store #695. In court filings, IGF broadly denied Portillo\u2019s claim that she was harassed and discriminated against at the store, and argued that they had no choice to fire her because she was undocumented at the time.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAfter an eight-day trial, a jury in August made a rare verdict under the D.C. Human Rights Act, finding Portillo was subjected to a hostile work environment, then fired after making complaints. She was awarded nearly $1 million in damages. IGF is appealing.\n\nNow, Portillo, who is originally from El Salvador, has a new job: working for the LGBTQ+ clinic that helped her, both during her transition and her legal fight. And she has a simple philosophy when it comes to helping others who might be facing the same battles she did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFight for your rights,\u201d Portillo said. \u201cAnd do not allow anybody to humiliate you.\u201d\n\nAn escape, and a new name\n\nGrowing up male in El Salvador, Portillo felt like a girl on the inside for as long as she can remember. Surrounded by sisters at home, Portillo said she was supported by her immediate family members, who didn\u2019t flinch when she tried on her sister\u2019s shoes and dresses.\n\nBut outside of her home, Portillo said she was a frequent target of harassment and abuse from extended family, classmates and even strangers. While testifying in court, she recalled walking home late one night when she was ambushed by a man who pointed a gun to her chin and demanded that she perform oral sex; the man threatened to harm Portillo or her family if she told anyone about the attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn El Salvador, things are very polarized; black and white \u2014 if you are a man you have to look like a man,\u201d Portillo recalled in an interview. \u201cIf you look like a woman but are a man that\u2019s not seen very well in the eyes of God. And they give you a hard time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFearing for her life, Portillo in 2006 fled to the United States and arrived in Maryland, where some of her family lived. She began working at fast-food restaurants and taking English classes at the library. And she soon found a community to embrace her at La Cl\u00ednica del Pueblo.\n\nLocated in Columbia Heights, the bilingual community health center provides resources to residents from Central America and elsewhere. Their Empod\u00e9rate program, which focuses on Latinos who are LGBTQ+, serves about 500 people annually by providing services like free medical testing, connections to interpreters and legal resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuyanna Barker, chief program officer at La Cl\u00ednica del Pueblo, notes that it\u2019s particularly difficult for Latinos who also identify as LGBTQ+ to find a safe space.\n\n\u201cPeople used to tell us: \u2018When I\u2019m among the LGBTQ community, I feel safe to be gay, but when I\u2019m around Latinos, I am not; yet when I\u2019m with the LGBTQ community, I don\u2019t feel safe to be Latino.\u2019\u201d Barker said. \u201cThere are levels to discrimination.\u201d\n\nAt Empod\u00e9rate, Portillo was welcomed by a group of transgender women who offered advice about employment and health care. They encouraged her to move to D.C. and she became a regular at the clinic. When she met trans women who were undergoing hormone therapy, Portillo was intrigued. She asked them what the process was like, since she was becoming interested in doing it, too. \u201cThey told me that I would be feeling a little bit fragile,\u201d she recalls.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs she began thinking about her future as a woman, she also desired a new feminine name. Portillo struggled to come up with something until she remembered the beautiful princess who had captivated her as a child; first because of her elegant fashion sense, but later, her humanitarian work: Princess Diana.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t mind picking up a child that maybe had HIV; she helped a lot of people who had lower resources,\u201d Portillo said. \u201cIt makes me emotional to think about what her name represents.\u201d\n\nBut outside the embrace of Empod\u00e9rate, Portillo found a different reality.\n\nWhen she started working at the McDonald\u2019s in 2011, she presented as male. She said she was praised and promoted for her efforts, and her co-workers, who were mostly Latino, knew Portillo only by her birth name, Gerardo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when Portillo came out to her manager as a transgender woman in summer 2013, she anticipated it would take some time for her co-workers to get acclimated to her identity.\n\nBut she said her co-workers kept calling her Gerardo, even after she reminded them privately of her new name, Diana. And she noted she had not yet received an updated name tag, despite requesting one. She questioned whether her manager truly had her back.\n\nPortillo sought help from Casa Ruby, a now-defunct LGBTQ nonprofit in D.C. founded and run by a Salvadoran trans woman. Casa Ruby wrote a complaint to the store on Portillo\u2019s behalf, describing the discrimination she had faced while urging the staff to respect her name and gender preferences.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a meeting a few weeks later, a supervisor told Portillo that no one at the workplace was obligated to call her Diana or recognize her gender identity, Portillo testified in court. Some of her co-workers grew emboldened after learning her complaints had gone nowhere, she said, continuing to call her Gerardo. She said she heard them making jokes about her genitals. She remembers arriving to the store in makeup, only to hear co-workers exclaim \u201cthe clown has arrived.\u201d\n\nIn another instance, Portillo said she was sent home early after correcting a manager who had repeatedly called her Gerardo. \u201cYou are a guy. Your name is Gerardo. I am not going to complicate my life with you. You are going home,\u201d the manager replied, according to Portillo\u2019s testimony.\n\n\u201cAt the store, I found the same situation that I lived in El Salvador,\u201d Portillo said at her trial, according to court transcripts. While crying on the witness stand, she added later: \u201cI went to work every day praying to God to help me finish that day without losing it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she said the director of operations for the store\u2019s parent company did listen to her in 2015, giving her a new name tag, updating her name in the store\u2019s computer system and allowing her to wear a scarf that female workers wear, Portillo also said the discrimination from her colleagues intensified.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThey would say, \u2018What does it matter that they\u2019ve changed the name in the system and gave you a name tag saying Diana, when you\u2019re still Gerardo?\u2019\u201d Portillo recalled in court. In an interview, she continued: \u201cIt was as if someone threw a rock at a beehive and made everything worse.\u201d\n\nStaying in the fight\n\nIn late January 2016, La Cl\u00ednica del Pueblo helped Portillo file a second written complaint that was nearly identical to the one she filed two years earlier. About two weeks later, tensions at the store came to a head when a customer complained to a manager that Portillo had used the women\u2019s restroom. Instead of explaining why, Portillo says the manager lambasted her within earshot of the store\u2019s customers \u2014 an incident was captured on video and played in court during the trial.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a man. You can\u2019t use the women\u2019s room. You\u2019re not a woman,\u201d Portillo recalled her manager saying loudly.\n\nShe was soon fired. IGF told Portillo she was terminated because of her unprompted admission weeks earlier that she was ineligible to work in the United States, according to Portillo and a termination letter used as evidence during the trial. Portillo contends that IGF always knew this was the case.\n\nShe became so depressed that she tried unsuccessfully to take her own life.\n\nShe started working with a psychologist, but found it too painful to relive her memories at the store. So she again turned to her friends at Empod\u00e9rate, who urged her to keep fighting.\n\nIn August 2016, with help from Whitman-Walker Health, a local health center that has long served the area\u2019s LGBTQ community, Portillo submitted an external administrative complaint with D.C.\u2019s Office of Human Rights against IGF. When the process stalled in 2020, she asked for her complaint to be dismissed so that she could file the case in D.C. Superior Court with the help of the Correia & Puth law firm in early 2021.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn addition to denying Portillo\u2019s claims of harassment and discrimination, IGF said it was unable to confirm all of the allegations in her 2016 complaint after investigating the claims, according to a separate letter given to Portillo on the day she was fired \u2014 though the store found that managers and supervisors should be better prepared to accommodate transgender employees.\n\nAfter the jury verdict in her favor, the store\u2019s owner unsuccessfully petitioned for a new trial. In a statement, IGF said it hoped for a more favorable outcome in appellate court, where \u201cwe are confident the facts of this case will come out.\u201d\n\nPortillo says her experience at store #695 has fueled her desire to try to help others. She gained asylum in March 2024, and one month later she took a new job at Empod\u00e9rate, where she helps clients get tested for STIs and directs them to resources such as immigration counseling.\n\nMore confident than ever, Portillo says she loves to explore new cities. And whenever she gets a chance, she goes out dancing with her friends. She remains in close contact with much of her family in El Salvador, and frequently gathers with her sister, nieces and nephews in Maryland.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHer family worried for her during the trial, with constant questions about when it would be over. She was thankful to tell them when it was finally done: \u201cEveryone said, \u2018Oh, thank God!\u2019\u201d recalls Portillo.\n\nShe hopes to make a career at Empod\u00e9rate, where she assists young LGBTQ+ people navigating complicated processes like health insurance and legal systems. She helps lead a peer support group that meets twice per week. And she gets to advise trans women who enter the clinic\u2019s doors in search of support or a community.\n\nPortillo pays special attention to the newbies \u2014 particularly those who mention being harassed at school or at work.",

            "content": "GOSHEN \u2013 The much-anticipated trial of Edward Holley, accused of killing Megan McDonald more than two decades ago, began on Monday in Orange County Court with jury selection.\n\nJudge Hyun Chin Kim is presiding over the case. State Police arrested Holley, 42, of Wawayanda, on a murder charge in April of 2023 in connection with McDonald\u2019s death 20 years prior in the Town of Wallkill.\n\nHolley allegedly killed the 20-year-old SUNY Orange student whose body was found in a wooded area of the Town of Wallkill. She died from blunt force trauma, police said. Shortly after Holley\u2019s arrest, Orange County District Attorney David Hoovler requested the appointment of a special prosecutor in the case\n\nThe basis of the DA\u2019s application for a special prosecutor is that while in private law practice before becoming district attorney, Hoovler represented a client in negotiations with the DA\u2019s office regarding potential information that the client might provide regarding Megan McDonald\u2019s death.\n\nThat client passed away prior to Hoovler taking office. Although the DA\u2019s office had been consulting with the State Police on issues during the investigation, the office was neither alerted to Holley\u2019s imminent arrest and not given an opportunity to review the 17-page felony complaint in advance of it being filed with the court.\n\nGiven the theory of the case as outlined in the felony complaint and the facts concerning Hoovler\u2019s prior legal representation, there would be a substantial appearance of a conflict of interest in the prosecution of this case that remained in the Orange County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nJulia Cornachio, an attorney with over 30 years\u2019 experience as a prosecutor and who handled several homicide cases in the Bronx and Westchester DA\u2019s office, was named special district attorney. She will be assisted by Laura Murphy, Esq., another experienced former prosecutor who has handled many homicide cases and was the chief of the Westchester DA\u2019s Office Cold Case Bureau.\n\nThe McDonald family has been highly critical of Hoovler. Last year, McDonald\u2019s mother and sister on Monday filed formal attorney disciplinary complaints against Orange County District Attorney David Hoovler and five other attorneys, including his predecessor, Frank Phillips, with the Attorney Grievance Committee for New York\u2019s Ninth Judicial District.",

Yet as she wrote in her memoirs, her early years remained imprinted: I am from Little Rock and will always feel like an Arkansan, even though I lived many, many more years elsewhere; I\u2019m from the Great Depression but never felt deprived; I\u2019m from books, reading and libraries; I\u2019m from meeting my father at the corner as he returned home from work and riding on his car\u2019s running board the half block to our house; I am from having the best-ever maternal grandparents, I still think of them often; I am from taking long walks with my grandfather; I am from a family that prized good grammar, refined manners and punctilious behavior; I am from having my parents\u2019 divorce affect me for the rest of my life; I am from having three wonderful children who have never let me down; I am from having six equally ideal grandchildren and four [now 12] great grandchildren; I am from having been married for 67 years to a wonderful, selfless man; I am from feeling very lonely since my husband died and now see my life in black-and-white as opposed to the technicolor I lived with him.\n\nShe treasured all she had witnessed:\n\nWhen I saw the Grand Canyon, at age eight, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes; When I saw the ocean for the first time, at age nine, I was amazed; When I heard, at age eleven, that my parents were separating I was incredibly sad and mourned for the family we had been; When I was nineteen I married a young ensign fresh out of the Naval Academy and was incredibly happy; When I was twenty-two my first child was born and I was ecstatic to be a mother; When my grandchildren were born I hoped they would adore me the way I adored my grandparents; When my great-grandchildren were born I felt incredibly lucky to live long enough to know them. Madelon Norbury, born April 6, 1930 in Little Rock, Arkansas, was the daughter of Roberta Campbell, a journalist, and Joseph Bradford Norbury, an attorney. Her paternal grandfather, Tom W. Campbell, was the author of Arkansas Lawyer and two other books. After graduating from Mount St. Mary Academy in Little Rock in 1947, Madelon took the bold step of heading north to Washington, DC, to live in a boarding house near Dupont Circle and work as a clerk typist for the War Department. One evening not too long after she arrived in Washington, she went with friends to an evening out at the Hi Hat, a nightclub in the Ambassador Hotel, where she made eye contact with a USNA midshipman in uniform. In short order, the midshipman became Madelon\u2019s lifelong partner and love, her husband of 67 years, Ewing Raiford \u201cMickey\u201d McDonald Jr. Married in 1950, Madelon spent the next 25 years serving as a Navy wife, making her family\u2019s home wherever the Navy sent them. Her favorite duty station was the Holy Loch in Dunoon, her own Brigadoon that made her always light up remembering the \u201ctwo years in Scotland [that] were the happiest years of my life.\u201d She and Mickey raised their three children primarily in Washington, DC where Madelon\u2019s commitment to books, education, and equal rights led her to spend considerable time volunteering as a librarian at Hearst, Stevens, and Sacred Heart Elementary Schools as well as contributing her organizational and administrative skills to In The Swim and as the Red Cross representative to the Committee for Lead Elimination Action in DC (LEAD), a consortium of 35 agencies coordinated by Children's Hospital. She delighted in her time working at the National Cathedral\u2019s Herb Cottage and its London Brass Rubbing Centre. In 1981 Madelon and Mickey returned to Annapolis \u2013 first moving to Greenbury Point and then to Heritage Harbor \u2013 and spent the next four decades volunteering and being a friend throughout the town, with Historic Annapolis, the USNA Class of 1949, and dearest to her heart, many years as the Naval Academy Primary School librarian. In 2017, Madelon sat by Mickey\u2019s bed as he set sail on his final voyage. For the first time in 67 years, Madelon moved by herself, becoming a charter member at BrightView Senior Living Annapolis, when it opened in 2018. In her later years, she missed not only her beloved Mickey but her cousin Babs and her brother Joe as well. Madelon left this world quietly, the way she arrived and the way she lived, on March 2, 2025. Her family wishes to extend deepest appreciation to the nurturing, professional staff of BrightView Senior Living Annapolis and of Hospice of the Chesapeake. Madelon leaves behind a host of family members who aspire to meet her expectations of proper grammar, manners, and behavior, including three children \u2013 Devon Ross McDonald Clouse (Paul); Bradford Norbury McDonald (Kim); and Sheila Campbell McDonald (Bennett Finney); six grandchildren \u2013 Tyler Bradford McDonald (Mary), Holly McDonald Clouse Coutoumas (John), Mallory Rebecca Gill (Tommy Vu), Luke Anderson McDonald (Rose), Austin Paul Clouse (Laura), and Natalie Rose Gill; and twelve great-grandchildren (do they come cheaper by the dozen, she would say) \u2013 Ava, Colin, Ewing, Bailey, Richard, Ruby Lucille, Carter, Dora Grace, Quinn, Lucy Anne, Brady, and her namesake, Do Quyen Madelon; and her cherished niece and nephew, Julie and Andrew.",

He is survived by Philip Pedros and Cynthia George (Pedros) and her husband Ajit, his cherished grandchildren Benjamin and Isabel, his twin, Renato and wife, Cristina, sisters-in-law, Carole Savigni (Laura), Anna Maria Pedros, and many nieces and nephews.\n\nCarlo was born in Naples, Italy on July 9, 1933. He and Renato were the youngest of five siblings born to the late Filippo Pedros from Valencia, Spain, and Anna (Viola) Pedros from Naples, Italy. Even as a little boy during World War II, Carlo was always building something. He told us of building a little suitcase with a rope handle to carry his toys around because on several occasions he emerged from air raid shelters to find his neighborhood in ruins. Despite these tumultuous times, Carlo maintained a positive and optimistic view, reflected in one of his common phrases was, \u201cWell, let\u2019s see what happens!\u201d\n\nAfter the war, the twins excelled in gymnastics, and Carlo competed in national tournaments throughout Italy, but advancement in the sport was cut short in 1952 when he broke his neck. Always, the optimist, Carlo, made a full recovery and reentered sports by excelling in weightlifting again, taking the gold medal in many competitions. Carlo completed 2 years of mandatory military service in the Italian Army stationed in Verona, Italy as a radar operator before emigrating to the United States in 1956 and joining his oldest brother, Amedeo, in Connecticut.\n\nDuring a visit to Cape Cod and the National Seashore, Carlo met his life partner and future wife, Gay Louise Laura, and was soon visiting the Boston area every weekend eventually finding work in MA as a cabinet maker. Carlo and Gay were married in July 1961, settled in Wakefield to raise their family, and beautifully restore and renovate a 1830s farmhouse where they lived for over 50 years.\n\nCarlo completed accounting classes at Northeastern University and worked as an accountant for several years before moving to a position that satisfied his desire for creativity combined with his need to build things. His vast woodworking skills landed him a job with AVCO-Lycoming working as a technician on the heat shield for the Apollo Space Program. He eventually joined General Electric in Lynn where he completed their multi-year, in-house management training program. After 28 years, he retired from GE as the supervisor of the carpentry shop before being recognized for creating a model for heat transfer analysis used during engine development. It was these special projects he really enjoyed because of the direct collaboration with the engineers and the opportunity to apply his amazing creativity. Carlo was known to eagerly lend a hand to family and friends and was widely recognized for being able to fix anything.\n\nA true people person, Carlo and Gay loved to host company and entertain at their warm and welcoming home. The holidays were filled with family, friends, and lots of food, including his signature dishes of artichokes and roasted peppers. During his retirement, Carlo was grateful to have been able to make several trips back to Italy with Gay so she could spend time with his family and lifelong friends and experience where he grew up. Carlo also treasured his time in his shop or Phil\u2019s, whistling and working on the next project! Carlo had a lighthearted sense of humor and an appreciation of the important elements of life, family and friends. He will be missed but take comfort knowing he is finally reunited with Gay and his family and friends who have passed.\n\nVisitation for relatives and friends will be held at the McDonald Funeral Home, 19 Yale Ave., Wakefield on Saturday, March 15 from 9:30 to 10:30 am immediately followed by an 11 am funeral Mass at Our Lady of Assumption Church, 17 Grove Street, Lynnfield.

The initiative, aimed at providing comfort and support to families with children undergoing medical treatments, showcased the sailors\u2019 commitment to serving not just their country, but their local community as well.\n\n\n\nThe event took place at local Ronald McDonald House Durham, where Sailors worked together to prepare an assortment of cookies, including chocolate chip, red velvet, and M&M. The baked goods were hot and ready for the families at the Ronald McDonald House, offering families a small taste of home during their challenging times.\n\n\n\nPetty Officer NC2 Nebe, one of the Sailors who participated, shared the significance of the initiative stating, \u201cBeing able to give back in a personal way means so much to us. We know these families are going through a difficult time, and something as simple as a warm cookie can bring a little joy to their day.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Ronald McDonald House provides housing and support for families with children receiving critical medical care, ensuring they can stay close to their loved ones without the burden of costly accommodations. The sailors\u2019 volunteer work not only provided fresh-baked comfort but also reinforced the Navy\u2019s strong tradition of community service.\n\n\n\nOfficials from the Ronald McDonald House expressed their gratitude for the Sailors\u2019 efforts. Multiple representatives from the organization stated, \u201cWe are incredibly thankful for the Navy\u2019s support. Their generosity and kindness make a real difference for the families we serve.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis baking initiative is part of a larger effort by the Navy Recruiting Command to engage in community outreach programs. The Sailors hope to make this a recurring tradition, strengthening their ties with the local community and continuing to bring smiles to those in need.\n\n\n\nFor families staying at the Ronald McDonald House, the smell of fresh-baked cookies and the warm-hearted efforts of the sailors serve as a reminder that they are not alone in their journey.\n\n\n\nNTAG Carolina includes 53 Navy recruiting stations across the states of North Carolina, South Carolina and Augusta, Georgia.

            "content": "In 2010 I received my first passport. Since then, I have been privileged enough to travel to numerous countries. While countries differ so widely from each other and each has its own different sounds, smells and norms, I always find a sense of familiarity, comfort and intrigue when I see those magical golden arches.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, a company founded in the United States of America, has expanded to more than 36,000 locations in more than 100 countries around the world1 since businessman Ray Kroc joined the team in 1954. While there is a sense of familiarity with McDonald\u2019s, I am always intrigued by the differences in the menu offerings from Australia to the US, South Africa, Italy, Singapore, India and beyond. The arches remain the same, but the menu provides a diversity that has obviously taken into consideration the expectations of the society it serves.\n\nyou want fries with that?\n\nIn 2016, I watched The Founder starring Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc. The film tells the story of the beginnings of McDonald\u2019s (albeit with a little bit of creative licence\u2014it is Hollywood, after all). The systems and processes in the first McDonald\u2019s stores in San Bernardino, California, enabled efficiency like Kroc had never seen before and managed to create something uniquely fresh and new in the American roadside drive-in diner experience. Kroc recognised there was something special and unique about these processes and set about partnering with the McDonald brothers to change the world.\n\nInitially, as McDonald\u2019s started to expand and offer franchise opportunities, Kroc was bullish in his approach, demanding homogeneity in the experience and flavour. If you were a McDonald\u2019s restaurant, you would be expected to do things a certain way\u2014and the burgers would always taste the same whether you were in San Bernardino, California or Seattle, Washington. The approach across the United States was consistent and precise.\n\na strategic shift\n\nHowever, as the expansion of McDonald\u2019s continued and restaurants started opening outside of North America, the control of Kroc and that of the McDonald\u2019s Corporation had to change. How do you sell a Big Mac in India where the consumption of beef is frowned upon? The cultural and religious observances of India (among others) forced McDonald\u2019s to reassess its need for uniformity in practice and product\u2014and instead move toward a unity of mission.\n\nThe same principle that McDonald\u2019s was forced to recognise about the importance of being united in its mission rather than its practice also applies to the Christian Church.\n\nFor more than 2000 years, Christianity has been preaching its message all over the world. And, for more than 2000 years, that mission has been consistent, even though there have been advances in culture, civilisation and technology. Though technology has enabled our access to the world to become much quicker and more convenient than in previous centuries, the mission of the Church has not changed\u2014though the Church\u2019s methodology has evolved across the years and across oceans. Your methodology can only evolve when you are focused on unity of mission\u2014rather than practice.\n\nthe non-negotiables\n\nIt is the belief of Christians that Jesus selflessly volunteered Himself from heaven to earth and died like a common criminal in place of you and I\u2014every person throughout history: past, present, future. Not only this, but Christians also believe that Jesus rose to life again, defeating the power of death and that He is returning someday soon. This belief (particularly in the fact Jesus was then raised back to life) spurs Christians on. It creates within followers of Jesus a desire to share the hope of eternity with Jesus\u2014in a world made new.2 This is the mission of Christianity\u2014to share the news of a God who loved us so much, He made a way for us to be with Him forever, in a world made new. It is a mission expressed in different ways by different people presenting it in the only way they can to the culture they find themselves in.\n\nunited, not uniform\n\nThis spirit of unity in mission does not restrict diverse cultural and social identities\u2014rather, it embraces them. Unity in mission does not disregard the range of abilities and thinking, rather it harnesses them. Unity in mission recognises that with cultural, social and even personal differences, our mission is not hindered, but strengthened. And while this certainly creates tension (and often confusion), it enables this mission to be carried further than if Christianity took a homogenous approach\u2014replicating churches and expressions as though we are all robots.\n\nYes, I have been able to visit different McDonald\u2019s restaurants in my travels but I have also been able to visit a variety of different churches all around the world. Every one of these churches has the same mission, though they go about it in diverse ways.\n\nIt is exciting to see how Christians live out this mission in their own unique way. While all churches have a corporate worship experience, I am encouraged that it differs from church to church and country to country.\n\nThe mission of the church however, that is \u201cto share the good news of a God who loved us so much, He enacted a plan to enable us to be with Him forever\u201d, happens in other more practical ways than a corporate worship gathering. Some churches provide this hope through meal programs and food pantries, others through op shops. Still, other churches opt to hand out literature or assist in garden care for their community members while others fundraise and volunteer to free those in slavery.\n\nAll these different approaches still provide hope of a better future because of Jesus.\n\nAs much as the golden arches provide me with a sense of familiarity, the sense of intrigue they provide me is more evocative as I search not just for what is the same, but, more importantly, what is different as McDonald\u2019s contextualise their product for any given local market. The same is true for the church. Often defined by the symbol of a cross, the warmth of seeing \u201cmy people\u201d express the same love and hope in Jesus is always welcomed. However, more than that, I am always excited to see how this or that church uniquely expresses that mission within their community: communicating the love and hope we have in Jesus in a way uniquely contextualised for any given community.\n\nJosh Wood is a pastor in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n1. <mcdonald\u2019s.com/us/en-us/about-us.html>\n\n2.

McDonald's is celebrating the anniversary with some very special deals in honor of the occasion, including offering McMuffins for just $1 on Sunday, March 2. \"In 1975, a breakfast revolution began with the nationwide debut of the Egg McMuffin at McDonald's,\" the company says in a press release. \"Whether it was the melty cheese, the freshly cracked egg (now sourced 100% cage-free in the U.S.), or the perfectly toasted and buttered English Muffin\u2026 this simple, yet delicious sandwich struck a chord with America and inspired a whole new way to enjoy the most important meal of the day.\" If you want to take the chain up on its offer of $1 McMuffins, read on to find out how.\n\nNational Egg McMuffin Day\n\nMcDonald's is giving away your choice of McMuffins or Sausage McMuffins with Egg for just $1 through the app on Sunday, March 2.

Whether it's my personal favorite, the Egg McMuffin, or our crispy Hash Browns, fluffy hotcakes, or sweet and savory McGriddles, we're all about giving our customers the best start to their day.

McDonald's head chef Jessica Foust told Business Insider the company makes the cheese itself to be extra melty, creating a rich sauce for the sandwich. The eggs in McMuffins are made with special rings that keep the size and shape consistent, and the yolk is broken to ensure even cooking for all the eggs. It takes just two minutes for the eggs to cook, and the pre-cooked ham is seared for extra flavor.\n\n11 Healthiest McDonald's Orders, According to Dietitians\n\nValue Menu Deals\n\nAs amazing as the McMuffin Day deals are, don't forget McDonald's has great breakfast deals year-round. The Sausage McMuffins are part of the McDonald's McValue Menu, available as a Buy One, Add One for $1 deal. You can also choose a Sausage Biscuit, Sausage Burrito, or a Hash Brown as part of the deal.",

            "content": "Furthermore, technological breakthroughs are also contributing to the industry\u2019s transformation. Supply chain optimization, waste reduction, and increased production efficiency are being greatly aided by automation and artificial intelligence (AI). Moreover, robotics is deployed in food processing to increase production and efficiency, while AI-driven demand forecasting helps avoid inventory problems. Consumers\u2019 growing need for convenience is being met by the usage of digital ordering and delivery platforms, which opens new avenues for revenue growth. By adopting these technologies, companies are keen to improve operations and take advantage of growth opportunities in a market that is constantly evolving.\n\nOn the other hand, consumer behavior is also changing, putting forth factors like health, sustainability, and convenience. Thus, specialty stores have seen an increase in the demand for fresh and raw food. At the same time, budget-conscious shoppers are gravitating toward discount retailers, highlighting the growing importance of affordability. Thus, food companies must meet diverse consumer needs driven by the dual trend of seeking premium and value-oriented products.\n\nWithin the industry, inflation remains a key topic. While it was soaring in 2022, food prices have since declined. However, they are on the rise again, causing financial strain on both consumers and businesses. As reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in December 2024, grocery prices went up by 1.8% compared to the previous year, and food-away-from-home costs increased to 3.6%. Especially staple food items, including eggs and beef, had a sharp rise due to the avian flu wave and the supply limitations. These price fluctuations create a challenge for food companies, which must adjust their pricing strategies without sacrificing demand or alienating customers.\n\nThe global food industry has always stimulated economic growth, innovation, and a shift in consumer trends. It is projected to reach $2.2 trillion by 2032 from its market size of $1.64 trillion in 2022, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.99%, according to Market Research Future. Despite food being a necessity, the business dynamics within the food industry are very complex and companies must be adaptable as they navigate the complexities of rising production costs, changing consumer preferences, and global supply chain disruptions.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 High Growth Food Stocks to Buy . In this article, we are going to take a look at where McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stands against other high growth food stocks to buy.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEven with economic instability, the future of the food industry is promising, driven by global population growth, urbanization, and the expanding middle class in emerging markets. In addition, new investment opportunities are being created by the popularity of plant-based meals and alternative proteins. Thus, big industry players are prioritizing the integration of technology, sustainability, and innovation in their business model to capitalize on future growth potential.\n\nMany stocks stand out for their capacity to capitalize on this growth potential.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 10 High Growth Food Stocks to Buy, we used Finviz stock screener to gather stocks within the food sector with a strong market capitalization. We then narrowed the list based on each company\u2019s five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to identify those demonstrating consistent revenue expansion.\n\nFurthermore, we also considered the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock, using data from Insider Monkey\u2019s hedge fund database, which tracks the activity of 1,009 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs McDonald\u2019s Corporation (MCD) the High Growth Food Stock to Buy?\n\nA cook in a busy kitchen assembling cheeseburgers for orders.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Funds Holders: 67\n\n5-year Revenue CAGR: 7.78%\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) remains an influential force in the global fast-food industry, with over 40,000 restaurants spread across the globe. To drive long-term growth, the company continues to leverage its brand strength, extensive operational scale, and technological innovations.\n\nHowever, McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) faced a downfall in 2024, with full-year comparable sales declining by 0.1%. Despite this, Q4 ended December 31, 2024, showed signs of recovery with a 0.4% increase in sales. However, the U.S. segment faced an issue related to food safety, causing a YoY decline of 1.4%. Regardless of these challenges, the company\u2019s management is optimistic that the business will fully recover by Q2 2025, as consumer trust and foot traffic gradually return.\n\nGlobally, the company showed varying trends. Spain and Germany exceeded performance through value-driven promotions and creative menu innovations, such as the Friends-themed Happy Meal and Hot Ones collaboration. Meanwhile, the U.K. and France faced a decline due to unstable economies. Considering these challenges, McDonald\u2019s experienced rebounds in the Middle East and saw early signs of stability in China, boosting future growth prospects. Furthermore, McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)\u2019s focus on affordability and digital engagement has helped it thrive, with 175 million active loyalty users contributing $30 billion in system-wide sales over the 90-day period.\n\nIn line with its growth strategy, McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) continues to prioritize expansion with plans to reach 50,000 locations globally by 2027. In 2024 alone, the company added 2,200 new units, including significant growth in China, a key market for its future. For 2025, McDonald\u2019s has projected capital expenditures of between $3 billion and $3.2 billion, primarily dedicated to new restaurant openings. At the same time, the company remains committed to innovation, with the reintroduction of snack wraps and expanded chicken options expected to drive future expansion.\n\nTherefore, McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)\u2019s ability to overcome current challenges and continue to grow allowed it to stand among the 10 High Growth Food Stocks to Buy.\n\nOverall, MCD ranks 10th on our list of high growth food stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MCD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MCD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Unlike the pervasive rumors concerning the return of all-day breakfast, which are steeped more in wishful thinking and misinformed internet whispers than the Loch Ness Monster's existence, the fact that you can order up McDonald's best-selling item and a McFlurry in the nexus of United States government secrecy is 100% true. However, the Pentagon McDonald's isn't anything extraordinary \u2014 it's simply a place that federal employees go to catch a cheap lunch. It's even listed on the McDonald's website. But can one actually eat at this particular fast food location? You likely already know the answer.\n\nUnfortunately for the Golden Arches, the chain can't exactly bank on big bucks rolling in from tons of curious visitors descending on the Pentagon food court. Understandably, that particular McDonald's location is closed to the public. Only federal employees have access. Of course, the exclusivity of the fast food branch has only whetted the internet's curiosity regarding the idea of top-secret government cheeseburgers. While nobody is trying to cover up its existence, that hasn't stopped the matter from moving swiftly into the viral side of internet lore.\n\nRead more: The Countries Where McDonald's Restaurants Are Basically Illegal\n\nDon't Get Too Excited About The Pentagon McDonald's\n\nThe culprit is a trending song by YouTubers Silly Stu and Spencer Vann called (are you ready for this bombshell?) \"McDonald's in the Pentagon.\" The tune, which is accompanied by a bizarre and ridiculous music video, can only be described as \"annoying,\" and that's putting it generously. The lyrics play up the mystique of fast food in a secure facility, with plenty of one-liners about surveillance and secret clearance. Clips from the song made their way over to TikTok, sparking jokes and memes about eating Big Macs under the watchful eye of Uncle Sam.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCome to find out, those that have actually visited the Pentagon report that there's more to the government institution than simply a McDonald's. One Reddit user recalls all sorts of mundane businesses that also exist there, such as florists, barbers, grocers, retail stores, and even gyms. Confirming the aforementioned song lyrics, the Washington Headquarters Service notes that there are (or were) also Dunkin', Sbarro, Panda Express, and Taco Bell locations at the food court.\n\nAdditionally, McDonald's locations exist on various military bases from coast to coast, each of which also restricts access to authorized visitors. All of this to say that the Pentagon McDonald's is, objectively, a huge nothingburger. It's not a secret, it's not that cool, and it's not even unique. Still, the glamour of the concept persists. In a fact that should surprise exactly no one, the Pentagon has refused to comment on the issue.\n\nRead the original article on Foodie.",

            "content": "Musician Silly Stu's viral song, \"McDonald's at the Pentagon,\" explores the concept of working at the fast food chain in the super-secure facility. While the intention of the tune seems to be to entertain, it may have millions of listeners digging deeper to determine if the Department of Defense's top brass are actually lining up to try the newest McDonald's hacks or sipping on those iconic green Shamrock Shakes. The truth is: They may be.\n\nSituated on about 200 acres, the Pentagon is the workplace for more than 24,000 people, and it's probably fair to assume that they don't all pack a lunch each day. It's also likely inefficient to trek across that acreage to hop in the car and fight traffic in Arlington, all in the name of procuring a sandwich. So, it makes sense that the Pentagon offers food options to the workers there. And though we don't know whether they're ordering discounted Egg McMuffins or chicken nuggets (that would be hush-hush, of course), there is indeed a McDonald's on location that workers can visit.\n\nThat doesn't mean that your craving for a Quarter Pounder could land you an impromptu tour of the DoD, though -- it's off-limits to the public. And while it has been reported that McDonald's employs their own workers at its Pentagon location, it's hard to say how to go about getting a job there like Silly Stu mentions in his song.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more: Ranking Fast Food Burgers From Worst To Best, According To Reddit\n\nWhere Else Can Workers Eat At The Pentagon?\n\nA view of the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. - Glowimages/Getty Images\n\nIf you're basing your career decisions on the sheer number of available food options at the facility where you work, the Pentagon could be a solid choice. McDonald's doesn't have a monopoly on the fast food game -- right in the same section of the building, you could start your day at Dunkin', grab an affordable meal at Taco Bell, satisfy a Chinese food craving at Panda Express, and wrap it all up with dessert at Baskin Robbins.\n\nAnd if you wanted to take a more leisurely lunch break, you could peruse the other food courts throughout the building with options like Panera, Subway, Moe's Southwest Grill, a self-service buffet with daily specials from Market Basket, and a fresh food vending machine from Wellfound Foods that features salads, sandwiches, and more. Along the way, you can also wash it all down with an upside-down drink from Starbucks or a smoothie from Jamba Juice.\n\nWhile fast food does have a foothold in the multiple food courts at the Pentagon, there are some spots for when you're feeling a little fancier, too. Hissho Sushi is on hand to serve up fishy favorites in the form of bowls or rolls. Or, you can grab stylish Middle Eastern cuisine at Lebanese Taverna. Meanwhile, celebrity chef Robert Irvine's Fresh Kitchen offers options like Cajun mac and cheese or shrimp and grits which could serve as filling mains ... or maybe side dishes for a Filet-O-Fish?\n\nWant more food knowledge?

            "content": "Eleanor Walters Hamilton: 1929 \u2013 2025\n\nEleanor Walters Hamilton, a devoted ranch wife, mother, grandmother, and friend, peacefully passed away at the Central Wyoming Hospice and Transitions care facility on February 24, 2025 at the age of 95.\n\nEleanor Edith Walters was born on November 8, 1929 to Stanley and Helen Walters in Basin, Wyoming. She was raised on the family ranch in Hyattville, growing up with a deep appreciation for the land, hard work, and the simple joys of country life. This began her lifetime ranching pursuit.\n\nHer mother moved to Basin with Eleanor and Ron so they could attended grade school. After attending 1st grade in Basin they then moved back to Hyattville and attended 2nd through 9th grades there.\n\nWhen her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, Ron and Eleanor moved to Worland to finish high school. Eleanor\u2019s mother lost her battle with cancer and passed away when she was 16.\n\nShe graduated in May of 1947 in Worland and was salutatorian of her graduating class. That fall Eleanor, along with her brother Ron, attended the University of Wyoming. During her junior year at the University, she met Merle Hamilton who was in his last quarter at the University. After Eleanor graduated with a degree in history, she and Merle were married on August 31, 1951 on the family ranch at Hyattville. They moved to the ranch shortly after they were married. Together they built a legacy on their beloved ranch, weathering the seasons with grit, faith, and an unwavering dedication to family and livestock. From early morning chores to home-cooked meals that nourished generations, she was the heart of the homestead, embodying resilience and grace in every task she undertook.\n\nMerle and Eleanor raised two sons, Keith and Ken, instilling in them the values of hard work, honesty, and a deep respect for agriculture. Eleanor knew both the joys and hardships of ranch life. She experienced profound loss when her brother was tragically killed in a tractor accident on the family ranch in 1960. The tragedy left a lasting impact on her. Just a few years later, in 1964, she endured the heartbreak of losing her father, Stan, to cancer. Through these difficult times, Eleanor remained a pillar of strength for her family, leaning on her faith and the support of community to carry on.\n\nIn 1968, Merle and Eleanor purchased her uncle and stepmother\u2019s shares in Walters Brothers Ranch and took on the task of running the operation. Eleanor played a vital part in the ranch\u2019s success. The ranch was later renamed Hamilton Ranch. A master of many skills, she could assist in the lambing barn, feed a baby calf, milk a cow, mend a torn seam, and prepare a feast\u2014all in a single day. Eleanor would often be found on a Ford 8N tractor dragging the fields in the spring. She milked cows to be used to feed bum lambs and always raised chickens, ensuring a steady supply of eggs for the family breakfast.\n\nHer hands were never idle, whether tending to the garden, canning fresh produce, or cleaning house. While doing ranch work she would raise a garden and canned hundreds of quarts of green beans and pickles and lots of frozen corn when she was able to beat out the skunks, coons and deer. In addition to raising a garden, she took great pride in caring for and maintaining the yard around the house her father built in the late 1930s.\n\nEleanor was a key contributor to the sheep operation, assisting with the newborns before breaking away to prepare the noon meal for all of the folks working on the lambing or shearing crew. Eleanor often claimed she wasn\u2019t a great cook, but anyone that sat at her table knew otherwise, frequently asking for seconds if they were available, especially her mashed potatoes.\n\nEleanor rode thousands of miles alongside her husband, packing provisions and salt to the sheep camps in the \u201chigh country\u201d each summer. She\u2019d help with moving cattle from the lower elevations to the mountain and then help trail them home in the fall, always ensuring the crew had sandwiches and cookies to keep them going. Whenever there was work to be done in the sheep corrals, Eleanor was there. While she could hold her own working both cattle and sheep she would admit that her heart belonged to the sheep.\n\nIn addition to all of the ranch work and even though not an avid sports fan, she always made an effort to attend school functions like the home football and basketball games her sons played. There were probably times she felt the referees weren\u2019t the best but she would never think to \u201cboo\u201d their efforts \u2013 such behavior simply wasn\u2019t in her nature.\n\nEleanor was active in the Hyattville Methodist Church and always joined the other community members in organizing the annual \u201cchurch dinner\u201d to help raise funds to support the church.\n\nAs she and her husband began to slow down, somewhere in their late 70\u2019s they took the opportunity to travel to places around the United States and even to Canada and Australia. While Eleanor enjoyed seeing new places, she never liked to stay more than a day or so at any one place. When she set out to go someplace, she preferred to drive straight through and wasn\u2019t prone to stop short of her destination. Her husband, on the other hand, liked to stop along the way, often striking up conversations with strangers, while Eleanor would gently remind him they needed to get going. With all of their travels however, coming back to the ranch was always her favorite part of the trip.\n\nEleanor, like many other ranch women, worked hard to ensure there were healthy calves and lambs to sell in the fall. She preserved food from her garden to help offset grocery costs and continued to pitch in wherever she was needed, even into her 80s. The work on a ranch never ends. Her legacy is one of love, faith, and the enduring strength of a ranch wife.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her beloved husband, Merle Hamilton; her parents; and brother. She is survived by her sons, Keith and Linda (Yeager) Hamilton of Hyattville, Ken and Kathy (Weirauch) Hamilton of Laramie; her grandchildren: Diane (Hamilton) and Curt Cox of Casper, Doug and Michelle (Vigil) Hamilton of Worland, Ian Hamilton of Sheridan; and her great-grandchildren: Carter and Cooper Cox of Casper and Aspyn and Burgess Hamilton of Worland.\n\nEleanor wished to be cremated, and Newcomer Funeral Home in Casper honored her request. Her obituary and guest book can be found on their website.\n\nServices are scheduled for Tuesday, March 4, at 1 p.m. at the Hyattville Community Center\n\nThose wishing to donate to the Hyattville Volunteer Fire Department or the Hyattville Community Center can do so in Eleanor\u2019s name.\n\nMichael Wayne McDonald: 1979 \u2013 2025\n\nMichael W.

McDonald Rivet said despite warning signs, Muffley avoided seeing a doctor due to financial burden she and her husband had after losing their pensions, and she died in 2012 due to complications from cancer.\n\nMcDonald Rivet said under the legislation, the impacted retirees would get a lump sum payment to cover the pension benefits they should have gotten for the past 15 years, with 6% interest added for the delay.\n\nAfterwards, the legislation would fully restore their pensions as if the disruption never happened, McDonald Rivet said.\n\nSubscribe to the TV5 newsletter and receive the latest local news and weather straight to your email every day.\n\nCopyright 2025 WNEM.

This has prompted major chains such as Denny's and Waffle House to institute surcharges on products served with eggs.\n\nOverall food prices increased by a mere 2.5% in the 12-month period ending in January.\n\nRELATED STORY | Grocery retailers begin limiting egg purchases amid supply issues",

The fast-food chain first introduced the bagels in 1999 at some locations, but according to the company, this is the \u201cfirst time ever\u201d they have been available across the entire U.S.\n\nAfter being pulled from menus in 2020, McDonald\u2019s brought the bagel sandwiches back to participating locations in select markets in 2022 for a limited time and then again in 2024. The bagels began appearing on menus quietly last year, but due to their success, they are back for good. Fans can now find Bacon, Egg & Cheese and Steak, Egg & Cheese Bagel Sandwiches on menus nationwide.\n\nHow Long Have Some McDonald\u2019s Stores Been Selling Krispy Kreme Doughnuts?\n\nKrispy Kreme and McDonald\u2019s first announced their partnership in October 2022 when the companies began a small operations test in nine restaurants around Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe test run grew into 160 restaurants in the Lexington and Louisville, Kentucky, areas in March 2023. A year later, the brands announced an expanded national partnership, with a phased rollout to all McDonald\u2019s restaurants by the end of 2026.\n\n\u201cSince the launch of breakfast nearly 50 years ago, we\u2019ve continued to offer new menu items, flavors, and experiences that have made McDonald\u2019s an irreplaceable part of fans\u2019 morning routines,\u201d said Tariq Hassan, McDonald\u2019s USA\u2019s chief marketing and customer experience officer, in a press release last March. \u201cThis partnership is an exciting next step in that journey and a chance to unlock new business opportunities in the breakfast category and throughout the day. Our fans\u2019 love for Krispy Kreme runs deep, and we can\u2019t wait to make it even easier for them to satisfy their sweet tooth at McDonald\u2019s restaurants across the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe top request we receive from consumers, every day, is, \u2018Please bring Krispy Kreme to my town.\u2019 Partnering with McDonald\u2019s on a national scale will provide our fans and doughnut lovers unprecedented daily access to fresh doughnuts and the joy that is Krispy Kreme,\u201d said Krispy Kreme President and CEO Josh Charlesworth.\n\n\u201cSignificantly, by making Kreme Krispy accessible to fans nationwide through this partnership, we expect to more than double our points of access by the end of 2026. The partnership accelerates the development of our existing Delivered Fresh Daily channel, creating operating leverage through distribution density and production utilization,\u201d Charlesworth concluded.\n\nKrispy Kreme\u2019s rollout at all New York McDonald\u2019s locations began on Feb. 25.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMcDonald\u2019s will serve its bagel breakfast sandwiches nationwide , the company said in a press release Tuesday.\n\nAdditionally, McDonald\u2019s locations in New York City began serving Krispy Kreme doughnuts Tuesday, in an expansion of the doughnut marker\u2019s partnership with the Golden Arches.\n\nBoth menu item expansions are accompanied by in-app discounts on the Egg McMuffin to commemorate 50 years of McDonald\u2019s breakfast, according to the release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nBreakfast has been a bright spot for McDonald\u2019s as the chain looks to recover from a sales drop caused by an E. coli outbreak late last year. The nationwide addition of bagel breakfast sandwiches and expansion of Krispy Kreme doughnuts could help drive traffic alongside discounted offers.\n\nOn McDonald\u2019s most recent earnings call, Ian Borden, the chain\u2019s CFO, said that consumer response to deals like its Buy One Add One for $1 breakfast offer have been successful.\n\n\u201cWe've seen really strong take-up of that offer and breakfast has been a really strong daypart for the U.S. business through '24. It's an area where we're taking share,\u201d Borden said. Borden also foreshadowed the 50th anniversary deals on the Feb. 10 call.\n\nOn the discounting front, McDonald\u2019s will offer Egg McMuffins or Sausage McMuffin with Eggs for $1 on March 2 to consumers who order in the app. From March 3 to 30, consumers who order in-app breakfast delivery can get a buy-one-get-one Sausage McMuffin with Egg.\n\nThese egg sandwich promotions come at a moment when other chains, like Denny\u2019s and Waffle House, are adding surcharges to eggs and egg-based products in response to an ongoing bird flu epidemic among livestock that has crimped the country\u2019s egg supply.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has also been expanding its partnership with Krispy Kreme to new markets in recent quarters, with doughnut service starting late last year in Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The Golden Arches is using the doughnuts to fill a gap left by the sunsetting of the McCafe pastry lineup in 2023. The chain began piloting the doughnut program in Kentucky the year before.\n\nNew York City is a major addition for Krispy Kreme and McDonald\u2019s partnership, which covered 1,900 stores at the end for 2024, according to Krispy Kreme\u2019s earnings release. Krispy Kreme doughnuts will be available through more than half of McDonald\u2019s U.S. store base by the end of 2025, with full deployment complete by late 2026.",

They say there have been issues at the location with unruly teens.\n\n\"I thought it was very reasonable because they're crazy in this McDonald's,\" Sania Bolasingh said.\n\nThe NYPD says there have been 29 calls to 911 from the location, 2154 Nostrand Ave., so far this year. There were 111 calls last year.\n\nThe measure, along with doubling the number of security guards, is about prioritizing safety, said the owner, who has been working with police and the local business improvement district.\n\n\"We and the management are trying to be proactive here. We don't want something bad to happen first, before we begin to come look for solutions,\" said Kenneth Mbonu, executive director of the Flatbush Nostrand Junction BID.\n\n\"If they're not fighting, they would destroy property, leave garbage. Why would they want someone like that in their property? That's bad for business,\" customer Nya Bousiagnac said.\n\nTarget nearby has a similar policy\n\nSome people pointed out that there's a similar protocol at a Target right around the corner from the McDonald's. At the Target, according to a sign, all guests under 18 must be accompanied by an adult. CBS News New York also reached out to Target, but did not immediately hear back.\n\n\"These are very popular desk destinations. Our small micro businesses don't have issues like this,\" Mbonu said.\n\nMbonu said there are several schools in the area and its busy after 2 p.m. He added he's hoping this new effort at McDonald's will help with the crowds.\n\nCustomers, local residents see McDonald's policy differently\n\n\"I love it,\" local resident Dorothy Brasier said.\n\n\"I think it's really crazy,\" customer Kia Hamilton said.\n\n\"I'm not really sure about that carding because you're gonna lose a lot of business,\" one person said.\n\nWhile there on Tuesday afternoon, CBS News New York didn't see security checking IDs.\n\n\"I just walked right in and they didn't say anything,\" said Zehra Demircanli, a student at Midwood High School.\n\n\"I'm not siding with McDonald's because its discrimination against everybody under 20,\" Hamilton said. \"Sometimes, one bad person or a few bad people can ruin things for everybody.\"",

Mac went to Central and Dick went to West High School.\n\nAccording to a New England Historical Society article, when Mac and Dick's father lost his job at the shoe factory in Manchester, they all moved to California.\n\nThis was right after the brothers graduated from Central and West High.\n\nKeep Scrolling to see the first ever McDonald's in California, followed by the McDonald's-themed hotel that FAILED epically.\n\nLook Inside The World's Oldest McDonald's in Downey, California The world's oldest McDonald's in Downey, California originally opened 1953, nearly five years after the company was founded.

She described it as a \"crazy scene.\"\n\nFor the year she's worked there, every day after school, up to 20 teens go in and \"trash the store\" \u2013 \"throwing ice at customers, snatching bags of foods from Uber drivers and smoking weed inside the restaurant,\" Hussain told The Post.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nIn 2025 so far, there have been 29 calls to 911 there, the Post reported, which referenced the NYPD.\n\nThat pace would surpass the over 100 calls made from the store annually over the last three years.\n\nBig picture view:\n\nLast year, our sister station, FOX 5 DC, reported about a dozen Giant grocery stores in the region \"restricting entry to anyone under 18 after 6 p.m. without an adult\" \u2013 a new policy aimed at curbing crime.",

Lindgren passed the mark last Thursday, while McDonald did so last Tuesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEast Grand Forks actually saw three players pass 1,000 career points this season but senior Austin Rusling is out for the season with an injury.\n\nBoth McDonald and Lindgren have dads with basketball backgrounds.\n\nChase's dad, Travis Lindgren, was a 1,000-point scorer for the Green Wave, a former East Grand Forks boys basketball head coach and a Mayville State Hall of Famer, while Carson's dad, Marty McDonald, was a North Dakota Mr. Basketball winner out of Munich in 1992.\n\n\"Chase has probably done a better job defensively this season, which is better for him offensively,\" East Grand Forks coach Josh Perkerewicz said. \"Offensively, he's able to catch and shoot, as well as finish going to the basket. He's one of the best rhythm shooters I've ever seen. If he makes one, he'll probably make two or three.\"\n\nEast Grand Forks' Carson McDonald poses after passing 1,000 career points last week.

He went from averaging about 17-18 points per game to probably 28-29 per game. He's been a little more looking to score. We need that from him. He's making those adjustments from good shots to great shots and not forcing things. I think he's one of the most dangerous players in the section. He can get hot and make 10 threes.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith two games left in the regular season, East Grand Forks is unbeaten in section play and hoping to secure the No. 1 seed in the section tournament.",

            "content": "Be honest: before you even pull up to a drive-thru, do you already know what you're going to order? When it comes to the classic fast food chains, everyone has their go-to. At McDonald's, chances are you are going for a Big Mac (or a beefier Big Arch burger) or McNuggets\u2014and an order of perfect, unbeatable french fries, of course. While McDonald's CEO recently disclosed the chain will be expanding its chicken options in 2025 (yes, that means Snack Wraps are coming back), we can't stop seeing a different Mickey D's sandwich all over our social media feeds. And it's one the CEO isn't talking about.\n\nThat's probably because it's a \"secret menu\" item, aka a menu hack\u2014much like the viral McBrunch Burger. But this one is even bigger, bolder, and more unhinged. Behold: the Crunchy Double.\n\nWhat Is In a McDonald's Crunchy Double?\n\nThe Crunchy Double is a behemoth burger stack featuring a Double Cheeseburger with a layer of chicken McNuggets snuck in the middle\u2014oh, and drizzle them with McDonald's beloved Tangy BBQ sauce for good measure. It's a protein-packed \"Turf & Turf\" sandwich you'll probably have to unhinge your jaw to consume.\n\nBut before you grab your keys to head to a drive-thru to utter the words \"Crunchy Double\" into the speaker, you should know that\u2014like many of the best secret menu items\u2014it's not actually on the menu.\n\nThe Crunchy Double is a fan-created and -named sandwich, though back in 2022, when it was circulating on social media, McDonald's briefly added it to its official menu (with the caveat it was a \"Make It Yourself\" item). And yes, while the hack has been around for a few years, it's been gaining popularity once again on platforms like Instagram and TikTok.\n\nHow to Order a Crunchy Double at McDonald's\n\nTo enjoy a Crunchy Double, order a Double Cheeseburger, a 6-piece McNuggets, and side of BBQ sauce. From there, you can D.I.Y. the sandwich stack, placing the chicken nuggets and BBQ sauce wherever you'd like. In a social post from 2022, McDonald's ideal Crunchy Double stack started with a bun, then a layer of McNuggets, BBQ sauce, and then the rest of the Double Cheeseburger on top of that.\n\nWith the recent introduction of the Chicken Big Mac and the ever-popular McCrispy, you could even swap in a chicken patty (or two) for the McNuggets if you wanted to. But with frequent deals on McNuggets and the McValue menu, the chicken McNuggets are definitely the more economical route to go here. Hey\u2014the Crunchy Double may even cost you less than a Big Mac these days.\n\n\n\nAre you bold enough to try this viral McMasterpiece?",

Gas up the rental and head northwest to Clearwater.\n\nIf you reach Dunedin, you\u2019ve gone too far.\n\nLeft-hander Cade Povich starts against the Phillies after posting a 2.60 ERA and 0.868 WHIP in five September outings and holding opponents to a .162 average. He could be the first alternative if a spot opens unexpectedly in the rotation.\n\n\u201cPovich, what he did in the month of September kind of speaks for itself,\u201d said MASN analyst Ben McDonald, who\u2019s in camp as a guest instructor. \u201cAll I heard about him was his stuff was good in the minors, but could he get it over the plate, and I feel like he did in September. His stuff was pretty good.\u201d\n\nThe exposure to major league hitters has accelerated Povich\u2019s development.\n\n\u201cI think similar to, we talked about our hitters kind of getting the experience and making adjustments along the way. Cade had some good starts for us and I think he\u2019s taking that into this year,\u201d said manager Brandon Hyde.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s put some good size on, he looks different physically. It looks like he\u2019s walking around here with a lot of confidence right now. Looking forward to watching him pitch this spring. Talking with him, there\u2019s some things he wanted to improve on this offseason and in his side work, and the pitching coaches are happy with the progress he\u2019s made in some pitch development things. I think he\u2019s come a long way.\u201d\n\nBrandon Young will be in the bullpen today, but he\u2019s going to start for Triple-A Norfolk and hope to finally make his debut this summer.\n\n\u201cI really like Young,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching him throw a couple bullpens and it\u2019s a mid-90s fastball, and then watching the analytical data, it\u2019s got some hop on it. It\u2019s got some good carry through the zone, his four-seamer. His off-speed stuff seems to be coming.\u201d\n\nRodolfo Martinez remains a camp curiosity with his blazing fastball, secondary stuff that includes a slider, splitter and sinker, and his absence from affiliated ball since 2019.\n\nMcDonald watched Martinez in the bullpen and live batting practice and said, \u201cThat\u2019s big. That\u2019s big stuff.\u201d\n\nVeteran Bryan Baker also has impressed McDonald, and he retired the three batters faced yesterday.\n\nBaker is on the 40-man roster but out of options. He might not make it through waivers.\n\n\u201cSitting 96-98 mph,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cHis bullpen (Friday) was pretty crisp, and he\u2019s got a new grip on that changeup. There was a time a couple years ago when I felt like Bryan would kind of slow his motion down a little bit on his changeup and hitters could pick it up. He\u2019s trusting it and throwing it now.\n\n\u201cBut look, even if you don\u2019t make the club out of spring training, you\u2019re gonna need arms, and that\u2019s just the course of 162 games. You\u2019re gonna need a lot of guys, cause unfortunately, injuries are gonna happen.\u201d\n\n* A question posed by one of the beat writers:\n\nWho makes more starts in 2025, Povich or Kyle Bradish?\n\nYou go first.\n\n* The Orioles are sending pitcher Ben Vespi to today's game as one of the extras from Twin Lakes Park.\n\nWhy is this noteworthy? Because older brother and former Orioles left-hander Nick Vespi is with the Phillies, and he's expected to pitch. They'll be on the field together.\n\nThis is a big deal for the family.\n\nThe Orioles signed Ben as an undrafted free agent in July 2024 out of UCF.",

            "content": "Kellogg\u2019s recent See You in the Morning campaign has sparked a lively debate: is it a masterstroke or a brand mishap? For me, it\u2019s the former. It exudes confidence, stripping the brand promise back to the essentials\u2014their iconic script wordmark and a tagline that owns the morning.\n\nBy declaring themselves \u201cthe OG\u201d breakfast, Kellogg\u2019s isn\u2019t just selling its cereal; they\u2019re staking a claim on a cultural moment in time and flexing the strength of their relationship with consumers by trusting the type to do the heavy lifting. It's a brand-focused play, leaving room for product-specific ads to follow. Is having one of the best logos becoming less important than weilding a strong typeface?\n\nKellog's recent 'og' campaign has certainly turned heads (Image credit: Leo Burnett UK)\n\nWhile nostalgia might tempt consumers to resist change, savvy brands know they must continuously evolve, particularly in their quest to connect with millennial and Gen Z consumers, who often favor pared back, clean and authentic design. But that\u2019s led to many familiar and trusted brands ditching their historic font and \u201cblanding\u201d their identity, much to the chagrin of those who feel affinity\u2014and yes, nostalgia\u2014for the brand.\n\nThe biggest risk isn\u2019t in altering visual identity, it\u2019s in becoming irrelevant. The trick is to evolve without abandoning the elements consumers have come to know and love. Coca-Cola, for instance, has managed to stay fresh while maintaining its core identity and iconic script word mark for over a century. The lesson? Adapt or fade away.\n\nWhy Are Logos Taking a Backseat?\n\nThe move away from logos represents a broader shift in branding. We\u2019re entering a golden age of typography, where fonts are not just a design element but a defining aspect of brand identity for large and small organisations alike. 83% of designers and creatives say that typography is one of the top three critical components in design decisions when working on a design project.\n\nTypography is a brand\u2019s visual tone of voice. Big names like McDonald\u2019s, British Airways and easyJet have recently relied on typography\u2014not their logo\u2014to carry their identity in bold campaigns. A strong typeface can be as recognisable as any logo. Dropping the logo and leaning into the brand\u2019s type in a campaign is like someone recognising your voice when you call, before you\u2019ve even said your name. It shows you\u2019re close\u2014a sign of true brand confidence, conveying emotion, authenticity, and values, all at a single glance.\n\nMcDonald's has gone logo-free in plenty of ads (Image credit: McDonald's)\n\nFor years, the design world was fixated on abstract logos, which require time and repeated exposure to build recognition. The challenge? Many of these symbols are ambiguous. For example, a mountain or a fox. But what do they actually represent? Typography, on the other hand, immediately communicates a brand\u2019s name while still allowing for distinctiveness.\n\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAnother factor driving this shift is accessibility. With democratized design tools, anyone can create a brand today. Emerging brands often skip the logo altogether and rely solely on type-based branding. This strategic choice shows that legibility and clarity matter more than an abstract mark.\n\nThe rise of typography-led branding also aligns with the digital-first era. With millennials and Gen Z's interacting with brands largely via social media and apps, a brand\u2019s first touchpoint with consumers is now more likely to be via a screen than on packaging or in-store displays. First impressions matter and for many brands, type becomes their primary ambassador!\n\nThat said, physical brand experiences still hold value. Just as vinyl records and handcrafted goods have enjoyed a resurgence, tangible brand assets such as packaging and signage retain their power. The key is in balance.\n\nThe Road to Iconic Status\n\nThe more constraints and values that are established, the easier it is to select or design a typeface that fits with a brand\u2019s personality. Is it human-centered or technical? Fast or luxurious? Each answer narrows the field, ensuring that the typography authentically reflects the brand.\n\nCreating an iconic typeface requires time, consistency, and cultural resonance. McDonald\u2019s type looks playful and friendly, reflecting its affordability and mass appeal. Kellogg\u2019s script looks lovingly created in a kitchen, hand-made and comforting, reinforcing its nostalgic breakfast connection. Coca-Cola\u2019s cursive typography is both elegant and timeless, almost a fashion statement. So, what makes these typefaces iconic? Emotion, loyalty, and generational recognition.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s cursive typography is both elegant and timeless, almost a fashion statement (Image credit: Coca-Cola)\n\nBuilding a typeface that is truly \u201cownable\u201d relies on differentiation. A typeface doesn\u2019t have to be the most unique in the world, but it needs to stand apart from its competitors. Consider The New York Times and its signature Cheltenham typeface\u2014it\u2019s instantly recognizable.\n\nLeaning into custom typefaces has given Kellogg\u2019s an ownable typographic look, and this campaign puts it front and center, as the most valuable brand asset they have.\n\nHowever, brand status isn\u2019t permanent. Once-mighty brands like Kodak and BlackBerry serve as cautionary tales. Even the most recognisable typography won\u2019t save a brand that fails to innovate and stay relevant.\n\nThe bold future\n\nTypography-led branding isn\u2019t just a passing trend, it\u2019s a strategic shift that will continue to shape the future of design. In millennial and Gen Z focused industries like fintech and SaaS, where concepts can be abstract, typography provides clarity and instant recognition. Meanwhile, legacy brands like Kellogg\u2019s prove that when done right, a well-crafted typeface can be just as powerful\u2014if not more so\u2014than the logo itself.\n\nAs branding evolves, one thing is clear: typography isn\u2019t just a design choice. It\u2019s a bridge that connects message to user and a powerful statement in brand confidence, authenticity, and identity.",

Despite the missing pieces, he taught himself tricks through imagination.\n\n\"My imagination was crazy back then, and I was able to figure out how these things worked just by playing with them\u2014even with pieces missing,\" he said.\n\nHis passion for magic was solidified after seeing Goldfinger and Dove, one of the first African American magic duos on television.\n\n\"Then I was able to visualize myself as a magician, because sometimes you need to see the thing before you can become the thing.\"\n\nOver the years, McDonald broke barriers, becoming the first Black president of the Society of American Magicians and contributing to the creation of a tribute wall for Black magicians at Hollywood's Magic Castle.\n\nA historical election\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nReflecting on his historic election as the first Black president of the Society of American Magicians, McDonald said, \"When I got inducted, I was like\u2014wow\u2014I\u2019m the first Black president since 1902! And then I was like wow. Man. I\u2019m the first Black president since 1902? You see? It gave me two different views of what\u2019s going on.\"\n\nCreating a legacy\n\nWhy you should care:\n\nMcDonald's work is not just about magic; it's about creating a legacy and inspiring future generations. He aims to leave \"magical breadcrumbs\" for those who come after him, ensuring that the contributions of Black magicians are recognized and celebrated.\n\nHis performances transcend racial and cultural boundaries, reminding audiences of the universal wonder of magic.\n\n\"We take grown folks back to their childhood\u2014that sense of wonder where they first saw that \u2018aha moment.\u2019\"\n\n\"Magic is the great equalizer\u2014you\u2019re white, I\u2019m Black\u2014Asian over here, but when that curtain opens, you see that I\u2019m Black for maybe one minute, and then the magic takes over,\" he said. \"If we get rid of all of that pre-conceived whatever, we can live a really wonderful life.\"\n\nInspiring future generations\n\nWhat's next:\n\nMcDonald continues to inspire the next generation of magicians, including young performers of color studying within the Academy of Magical Arts\u2019 Junior Society.\n\nHis recent participation in a Black History Month event at The Magic Castle showcased the talents of African American magicians from across the U.S. and Canada, further cementing his role in making history with every illusion.\n\n\"This is one of the busiest places, so we put it right here so people can see that these artists did exist,\" McDonald explained.",

McDonald\u2019s was founded in 1940 by the McDonald brothers, Dick and Mac. However, it wasn\u2019t until 1954 that the foundation for today\u2019s McDonald\u2019s was laid. At that time, executive Ray Kroc discovered a small restaurant in California on Route 66.\n\nAfter unsuccessfully trying to take control of the company, Kroc became responsible for one of the first franchises. Now, with a presence in over 100 countries and more than 38,000 locations, McDonald\u2019s is one of the largest fast-food chains. In the US, they have 13,598 restaurants, with plans to add more in the coming years.\n\nThe first McDonald\u2019s franchise opened in 1955.\n\n\n\nSales on the first day were $366.12.\n\n\n\nToday, McDonald\u2019s generates $366.12 in sales every 0.5 seconds. pic.twitter.com/CoVvtp5KuE \u2014 Jon Erlichman (@JonErlichman) January 31, 2023\n\nMcDonald\u2019s restaurants and their franchisees\n\nApproximately 93% Of McDonald\u2019s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent local business owners, according to data on McDonald\u2019s website. The process of opening a franchise is supported by the company, which selects and evaluates locations based on business opportunity and profitability criteria.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s handles property acquisition and makes all necessary investments to adapt the space to brand standards,\u201d the company explains. The company seeks individuals who are capable of operating multiple locations. Candidates who have successfully operated multiple businesses may be suited to operating several McDonald\u2019s franchises.\n\nAnd also, the company requires a minimum of $500,000 of non-borrowed personal resources as a down payment for anyone to be considered for a franchise.\n\nAt this point, one might wonder if it\u2019s really worth becoming a franchisee of this fast-food giant. It also begs the question: how much does a McDonald\u2019s franchisee earn?\n\nThe cost of becoming an McDonald\u2019s franchisee\n\nAccording to franchise expert Borja Espa\u00f1a, \u201cMcDonald\u2019s is one of the franchises with the lowest profit margins. The profit percentage for branches is between 10% and 15%. In the franchise world, that\u2019s not a percentage to say \u2018Wow!\u2019. But of course, if you make three million euros (which a McDonald\u2019s does, he assures), then yes,\u201d he reasons.\n\nBorja also highlights the rental cost of the location, \u201cwhich is not cheap\u201d. As he explains, the company owns the location and rents it to franchisees. \u201cThe effort rate is around 15%\u201d (the portion of periodic savings allocated to rent).\n\nFinally, he asserts that \u201cMcDonald\u2019s benefits more from having you as a franchisee than you do from being a McDonald\u2019s franchisee. But honestly, I find it logical and acceptable because what they offer is only provided by three or four brands worldwide, and it\u2019s worthy of recognition.\u201d\n\nUltimately, profitability will depend on several factors including operating and occupancy costs, financing terms but most importantly, the ability to operate the business effectively.\n\nRelated stories\n\nGet your game on!

            "content": "The McDonald's (MCD 0.88%) story is the American dream. The company has grown into an absolute juggernaut of capitalism, and is the largest restaurant chain in the world. That said, it's been a bit of a boring investment over the last five years. The burger chain has struggled to keep up with the broader market, and doesn't look like the buy that it was in years past.\n\nA stagnating giant\n\nMcDonald's has underperformed the S&P 500 by 20% over the last five years. The company has had on and off years, with top-line revenue growth not always hitting the mark. Most recently, full-year 2024 results were flat at $6.39 billion versus $6.4 billion in 2023, and came in below estimates of $6.44 billion, while net income declined 1% to a little under $2.02 billion, or $11.39 per share compared to 2023's earnings of $11.56 per diluted share.\n\nPart of the reasoning for the recent weak quarter was an E. Coli outbreak that impacted certain menu items, such as the ever-loved quarter pounder. While this was certainly part of the problem, it is crucial to realize that the fourth quarter wasn't the whole story. McDonald's saw declines before the fourth quarter. Global comparable sales declined 1.5% in the third quarter, and 1% in the second quarter, showing broader weakness for the company.\n\nMcDonald's has made moves to try to counter the decline, such as a new affordable combo meal. According to recent commentary, the $5 combo meal does seem to have created a draw for more value centric consumers, but it means the company has to increase transactions in order to cover the decline in overall ticket for orders, or drive up the average ticket on those orders.\n\nMcDonald's itself noted that the overall average check on its $5 discount orders has actually come out to more than $10, but the full-year results raise the question of how much impact this is actually having.\n\nA tough time beating the market\n\nJ.P. Morgan analysts put their McDonald's price target at $300 a share. That provides for basically no upside from current pricing, and furthers my feelings that this is not a stock that's going to beat the market.\n\nDetails for forward guidance were a bit sparse, but analyst estimates are calling for $12.28 per share in 2025. That would give the stock a forward P/E ratio of 24.78 times earnings. That's just below its historical 10-year average of 25.55 times earnings, according to Fullratio.com.\n\nMcDonald's is trying to spur sales through value options and new items like chicken strips, but one has to wonder whether the burger chain can keep the average check on these orders at $10, or if consumers will taper off and lower McDonald's average ticket per order. Either way, the trend certainly puts pressure on its more high-value items.\n\nAccording to CNBC, McDonald's CFO Ian Borden expects the first quarter of 2025 to be the weak point for same-store sales. I hope that's the case, but the broader picture here has been one of lackluster results compared to competitors (from the point of view of stock performance). Newer rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill or Cava are outpacing McDonald's, and look primed to continue doing so. These two companies are producing revenue gains in the double digits annually, and seem more primed to grow compared to an older giant like McDonald's, which explains its lower valuation.\n\nLet's be clear. This is still a strong company on its own, but McDonald's is demonstrating a performance that doesn't necessarily make it a strong investment. As much as I love a Big Mac from time to time, investing requires discipline, and it doesn't seem to make much sense in the fast food world to go with the more sluggish name. This is especially true if J.P. Morgan's estimates for its price point hold true.",

While the iconic McRib has caused quite the stir in recent years and the Snack Wrap will make its way back into our patient stomachs prettys oon, the true best-selling item is one that wasn't sold at McDonald's until nine years after it first opened its doors in San Bernardino, California. At the time it was a humble barbecue restaurant crafted by the two McDonald brothers. The coveted item that eventually became the fast food chain's top-selling food is none other than McDonald's French fries. Across the globe, McDonald's sells an impressive estimated 9 million pounds of fries each day, amounting to a whopping 3.29 billion pounds per year.\n\nInitially added to the menu to replace potato chips as fries continued to gain popularity nationwide after WWII, McDonald's has stuck by this menu item ever since. With a variety of dippable sauces available, these fries serve as the perfect subtle salty base for highlighting McDonald's most delicious flavors. Funnily enough, despite how well these iconic fries pair with sauce, they were initially meant to be eaten solo. Ketchup was reserved for burgers and other meat products. However, after numerous customer requests McDonald's began to provide customers with a dipping cup (also known as a Dunk Cup) of ketchup upon request. As ketchup grew in popularity, these Dunk Cups paved the way for the debut of the now-common ketchup packets.\n\nRead more: The Countries Where McDonald's Restaurants Are Basically Illegal\n\nWhat Makes McDonald's Fries So Popular?\n\nMcDonald's fries in red and yellow box closeup - Valerii_k/Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald's French fries were initially not exactly vegetarian-friendly. The fries were cooked in a special frying oil called Formula 47, made primarily of beef tallow mixed with vegetable oil. This rich, buttery flavor became exceedingly popular, but by 1990, McDonald's switched to cooking fries in purely vegetable oil. This was largely due to rising health concerns, particularly due to one outspoken man who claimed beef tallow is why he suffered a premature heart attack. McDonald's quickly denied this claim, but made the change anyway. By 2007, the oil evolved again, this time with lower trans fat (though beef flavoring still remains in the mix).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven with the change in flavor, McDonald's fries have only grown in popularity since, besides an initial drop in stock after the company announced it was switching from beef fat to vegetable oils. Even with the temporary setback, French fries were McDonald's most popular order in every state in 2022 and for good reason. They pair well as a side for most McDonald's entrees and despite being frozen prior to frying, the end result still tastes pretty fresh. Try to get a made-to-order batch by requesting your fries without salt.\n\nRead the original article on Foodie.",

According to the Marine Conservation Society, we should avoid eating the 'big five' overfished species \u2013 cod, prawns, salmon, tuna and haddock. Instead, we should choose more sustainable options \u2013 hake, mussels, farmed trout, anchovies, sardines and coley. There are far too many jellyfish in the sea, and we have an ever-increasing number of mouths to feed on Earth. Therefore, experts suggest we should eat jellyfish instead of popular overfished options like cod. Lion's mane, moon and barrel jellyfish are all species found in UK seas and edible when prepared correctly.

It was created in 1962 by a McDonald's franchise owner in a mainly Catholic part of Cincinnati, Ohio, in response to declining hamburger sales on Fridays due to the practice of abstaining from meat on that day\n\nSimilar to the McDonald's tray liner, Kitchen Theory has placed an informative slip of paper underneath my burger telling me more about what I've just eaten.\n\n'Jellyfish do not have traditional sensory organs like hearts, brains or bones,' it says. 'Instead, they have nerve nets and specialised cells to detect changes in their environment.'\n\nAccording to the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), a sustainable approach to fishing jellyfish would be 'essential' if the UK were to develop a taste for them.\n\n'In many Asian countries, jellyfish are a delicacy, often enjoyed in salads and stir-fries,' Gareth Cunningham, director of conservation and policy at MCS, told MailOnline.\n\n'If we in the UK were to develop a taste for jellyfish, we'd need to put restrictions in place to make sure we don't catch too many.\n\n'Fished in an ocean-friendly way though, jellyfish could offer a sustainable source of protein.\n\n'Lion's mane, moon and barrel jellyfish are all found in our seas and edible when prepared correctly.'\n\nOther weird but wonderful dishes on show at Kitchen Theory tonight are a starter of a jagged tapioca crisp paired with a plump spiced jackfruit doughnut.\n\nPictured, Kitchen Theory's starter of a jagged tapioca crisp paired with a plump spiced jackfruit donut - the chef's tribute to the bouba-kiki effect\n\n'Disgust' is the main course at Kitchen Theory: Sous vide guinea fowl dish with a beetroot stencil of Apple founder Steve Jobs\n\nThis is the chef's tribute to the bouba-kiki effect \u2013 the psychological tendency to associate round shapes with the word 'bouba' and spiky shapes with the word 'kiki'.\n\nThe main course is a guinea fowl dish called 'Disgust' with a beetroot stencil of various controversial celebrities, global leaders and tech founders, including Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Steve Jobs.\n\nThere's also an intensely-flavoured Saudi Arabian date pudding and a dish of jersey royal potatoes served with a bizarre woodland accompaniment, including soil aromas emanating from a bucket.\n\nIngeniously, placemats are simply circles of bright light from the overhead projectors \u2013 a welcome change from the dimly-lit restaurants where I can hardly see what I'm eating.\n\nChef Youssef has worked closely with Charles Spence, professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University, to help diners appreciate the difference between taste and flavour.\n\nDiners also learn first hand how all of the five senses \u2013 taste, smell, touch, sight and sound \u2013 influence how our brain perceives food.\n\n'We guide you through an 8-course tasting menu and drinks showcasing culinary creativity inspired by art, nature and the science of multisensory flavour perception,' Kitchen Theory says on its website.\n\n'This memorable dining experience is brought to life with the aid of audio, lighting, table projections, aromas, and textures to give you a unique multisensory and immersive evening.'\n\nKitchen Theory's \u00a3240 supper club, open to the public several times per month, is available to book on the restaurant's website.",

            "content": "Allrecipes/Adobe Stock\n\nNow that 2025 is upon us, the buzz surrounding McDonald\u2019s bringing back its iconic Snack Wraps is louder than ever. While fans were skeptical about the initial 2023 announcement that Snack Wraps were returning, the time has finally come\u2014yes, actually. McDonald\u2019s shared the news its 2024 Q4 Earnings Call.\n\nWith chicken sales soaring, in part thanks to the popular McCrispy, Mickey D\u2019s is leaning into its poultry menu.\n\n\u201cWe're excited about the significant opportunity we see within our chicken portfolio and see the potential to add another point of chicken market share by the end of 2026,\u201d McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said in the earnings call.\n\nThe biggest push in chicken will come from the returning Snack Wraps, which were discontinued in 2016 and featured a breaded chicken tender, lettuce, cheese, and special sauce in a snack-sized soft-shell tortilla.\n\n\u201cThis year, there is incredible energy for the return of Snack Wraps in the U.S.,\u201d Kempczinski said.\n\nHowever, while most Americans are excited about the wraps returning after years of petitioning, I\u2019m excited about what that means for another menu item: the discontinued Chicken Selects.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s crispy Chicken Selects were the fast food chain\u2019s take on chicken tenders\u2014and also the chicken offered in the classic Snack Wrap. They were discontinued in the United States in 2013, but have been available in the U.K. ever since.\n\nNow, McDonald\u2019s is bringing my favorite menu item back\u2014well, sort of.\n\nBloomberg/Contributor/Getty Images\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Is Bringing Back Chicken Strips This Year\n\nKempczinski stated in the earnings call that Mickey D\u2019s will \u201claunch a new chicken strip offering\u201d this year, likely timed with the return of the Snack Wrap.\n\nCalling it a \u201cchicken strip offering\u201d rather than Chicken Selects by name does make me skeptical\u2014it\u2019s unclear if they\u2019ll be the same recipe as the early \u201800s. According to everything we know so far, the Snack Wrap will still called a Snack Wrap, after all. However, as long as a chicken tender is back at McDonald\u2019s, all will be right in my world.\n\nWhen Mickey D\u2019s originally announced that Snack Wraps were returning, it was to coincide with its new McCrispy sandwich launch, which joined menus as a \u201cSouthern-style fried chicken sandwich\u201d alongside the classic McChicken. So, will the new chicken strips follow the McCrispy recipe? That information isn\u2019t available just yet, but you can bet that I\u2019ll be keeping my ears open for when it is.\n\nIn addition to the returning Snack Wraps and chicken strips, McDonald\u2019s announced that the Chicken Big Mac will return as a limited-time offering throughout the year as well.\n\nBetween the Snack Wraps, chicken strips, and Chicken Big Mac returning, Mickey D\u2019s is going all in on chicken this year. But, don\u2019t think we forgot about that 14-ounce Big Arch burger that\u2019s supposed to be coming stateside soon\u2014because I certainly did not.\n\nRead the original article on ALLRECIPES",

Stephen Hummel, McDonald Observatory Dark Skies Cartoon Norman Johnson The Triple Crown Gas Plant is shown before and after implementing night sky friendly lighting. Wittenbach/ Wren Cimarex/ Chevron/McDonald Observatory\n\nHaving launched a successful Dark Skies Initiative in West Texas, the McDonald Observatory is expanding that initiative to New Mexico.\n\nIn 2010, the University of Texas at Austin's McDonald Observatory teamed with oil and gas producers in West Texas to change lighting procedures and protect the night sky around the observatory.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nNow that effort is spreading to oil and gas facilities in New Mexico with the release of lighting guidelines by the Dark for the Park Alliance.\n\nLight doesn\u2019t respect boundaries, noted Teznie Pugh, superintendent with the observatory.\n\n\u201c(The Permian Basin oilfields) are the largest contributor to artificial sky brightness around the observatory,\u201d she told the Reporter-Telegram.\n\nPugh says the initiative is seeing success. Globally, artificial sky brightness increased 10% annually over the most recent five years. At that rate, she said the number of stars visible in the sky will decrease by half in the future. In West Texas, however, she said that has stabilized to a 4% increase over the last decade, notably lower.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe Dark for the Park Alliance was founded in 2023 after Carlsbad Caverns approached the oil and gas industry with the idea of collaborating on dark sky efforts and highlighting their benefits to the local economy, heritage to the lands and future stewardship of them. Today, Alliance members include Carlsbad Caverns National Park, Chaco Culture National Heritage Park, New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, the Bureau of Land Management, the New Mexico State Land Office, DarkSky International, DarkSky New Mexico, Apache Point Observatory, and McDonald Observatory.\n\nPugh said Carlsbad approached the observatory after seeing its success working with oil and gas operators active around the observatory. She added that colleagues are surprised by the observatory\u2019s positive relationship with the industry but called it a win-win for both the observatory and industry.\n\n\u201cFor us, keeping the skies dark enables our research and enables outreach. At the same time, as we work with oil and gas properties, we can help them reduce their energy costs,\u201d she said, adding that, anecdotally, operators tell her the strategies have also improved safety at their facilities.\n\nThe guidelines offer operators cost-effective strategies to reduce unnecessary light and energy waste and builds on similar guidelines in Texas published in 2018. Key principles include shielding lights so they shine down rather than up; using task-appropriate light intensity; and opting for amber-colored bulbs.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe Dark for the Park Alliance is working toward a similar goal. It seeks to maintain or restore the night sky quality of New Mexico\u2019s Permian and San Juan Basins through the adoption of night sky friendly outdoor lighting practices.",

The two have a strong relationship, and Leipold wanted to make sure Daniels would be comfortable.\n\n\u201cIt was best to get it taken care of now,\u201d Leipold said. \u201cYou know, probably find out here in a couple weeks exactly what we can see out of him this spring. It'll be very limited, but again, he's progressing well and again, he takes things in such a good way and finds a positive in it. And again, he'll be able to lead from the sideline right now and go from there.\u201d\n\nDaniels underwent a minor knee procedure over the offseason and will be a limited participant in spring practice. Leipold said it had been irritating Daniels for a while and he reaggravated it in December.\n\nLance Leipold met with the media on Thursday with spring football quickly approaching. He discussed a variety of topics, including the health of Jalon Daniels after his offseason procedure and the promotions of Jim Zebrowski to offensive coordinator and DK McDonald to defensive coordinator.\n\nZebrowski has good relationship with the team\n\nThe hiring process moved pretty quickly after Jeff Grimes left Kansas for Wisconsin, a move that Leipold said he was surprised by. Zebrowski remained professional when Kansas decided to go to an outside hire after Andy Kotelnicki left, and he\u2019s now reenergized after a long career of coaching football.\n\n\u201cI talked with Jim about if there were opportunities, some things that I would be looking for,\u201d Leipold said. \u201cAnd I can tell you this, I've been extremely impressed with how Jim has taken this and how he's organized the staff, how he's gone about the off-season and studying our self-scout stuff, what we're doing moving forward, everything. And he's excited. And I've seen a highly positive change in his demeanor. I think energized at this stage of his career.\u201d\n\nZebrowski and the offensive staff have built continuity over their time at Kansas. Matt Lubick rejoined the staff as co-offensive coordinator/tight ends coach. The chemistry of the staff is important, but it\u2019s equally important to try and elevate what you\u2019ve been doing.\n\n\u201cContinuity is big but stimulating new thoughts and ideas is always good as well, and Matt will bring new thoughts in and making sure that we don't get too convoluted in too many things,\u201d Leipold said. \u201cBut again, finding out what this new group of players are going to be able to excel at and finding a way to be productive will be the key.\u201d\n\nThe former quarterbacks coach has developed strong relationships with that room. Leipold thinks those relationships will be important as the offense moves forward.\n\n\u201cI think that'll be very, you know, very important as we move forward. I think it's important that we give our quarterbacks input on what they're liking, what they're comfortable and I know those guys will have that type of dialogue.\u201d\n\nMcDonald\u2019s vision for the defense in line with Leipold\u2019s\n\nKansas again went to an inside hire when Brian Borland retired, promoting DK McDonald to defensive coordinator. McDonald has NFL and college experience, but this will be his first time as a defensive coordinator. Leipold said McDonald\u2019s vision for the defense was \u201cvery much in line with what I\u2019d like to see us step forward as a defense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm excited to see this group led by him, kind of, you know, take the field here in a couple weeks,\u201d Leipold said. \u201cI like his attention to detail, his intensity, his expectations of getting a lot little things right. I think his time, whether it be with Matt Campbell at Iowa State or his time with the Eagles, will definitely pay off in a lot of different little things.\u201d\n\nMcDonald has 20 years of coaching experience, all focused on the passing game or secondary. Leipold said things with the defense may be simpler in some ways, but he likes how McDonald coached his position group.\n\n\u201cI think expectations of, you know, how we're gonna do things, how we're gonna rally to the ball, what we're gonna do and fundamentally sound,\u201d Leipold said. \u201cI just really like the daily approach of how he addresses position group and how that's gonna carry over into our defense and make us, you know, what we'd expect to be a better unit.\u201d",

His career with the team as an assistant defensive backs coach in 2021 and 2022. In 2023, he was promoted to become the defensive backs coach. Prior to his time in the NFL, McDonald served as the safeties coach at Iowa State under Matt Campbell.\n\nLeipold said the decision to go with McDonald as the new defensive coordinator came from the KU head coach's time watching McDonald work during the 2024 season.\n\n\"D.K.'s confidence, his interaction with players,\" Leipold said about what stood out about McDonald as a candidate. \"I probably sat in more of D.K.'s meetings last season than any other coach. And when Brian told me his intentions to retire, had some conversations with DK about his vision and what he saw and it was very much in line with what I'd like to see us step forward as a defense.\"\n\nKU's defense ranked No. 12 in the Big 12 last year in total yards allowed per game (392.6) and No. 12 in yards per play allowed (6.1). Nationally, KU's defense ranks No. 114 in total EPA and No. 112 in success rate.\n\nMcDonald said taking over the entire defense hasn't been a huge undertaking, mostly due to the fact that he's worked with so many of the players before. He worked with the entire secondary last season but he also spent some time building relationships with other players in the front seven.\n\n\"I've always been involved in all the other position groups, talking to them, encouraging them, giving them little tips,\" McDonald said. \"So it's really just taking the next transitional step and then making sure everything is organized. And then as we get in here in spring, just making the calls and everything like that, and setting the defensive mindset that we want here.\"\n\nDuring his coaching career, McDonald has worked with defensive coordinators who use three or four-man fronts. Iowa State created the 3-3-5 while McDonald was on staff. During his time with the Eagles, they ran a four-man front and made a Super Bowl with McDonald on staff.\n\nKU has continued to recruit to a four-man front and that is expected to be the base of the defense. Broadly, though, Leipold thinks there will be small tweaks.\n\n\"I think will be simpler in some ways,\" Leipold said. \"I don't want to get into comparisons of overly past or whatever. I think expectations of how we're going to do things, how we're going to rally to the ball, what we're going to do and fundamentally sound were things that I just really liked, the daily approach of how he addressed his position group, and how that's going to carry over into our defense and make us what we'd expect to be a better unit.\"\n\nMcDonald said he wants his defense to play physical, play fast and play together. That's the core of his message.\n\n\"You really want to see this defense play fast,\" McDonald said. \"The way we can do that is by being really simple. Playing physically, this is still a violent game played by violent men and I enjoy that part. I enjoy the physicality part of this. And then playing for each other. You always go a little harder for guys that you care about. So getting this group just to come together as one unit is fun because we got a lot of new guys. And so the joy of coaching is getting these new guys and these young guys to come together as one unit. So if we can play fast, play physical, and play for each other. I think we're going to play the type of football that we need to play and the type of defense we need to play here.\"",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 11 Stocks & President Trump\u2019s Approval Drop. In this article, we are going to take a look at where McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on whether President Trump would risk high inflation that could result from tariffs. While some have argued that the strengthening of the US dollar could reverse the tariffs\u2019 inflationary impact, Cramer commented on the effect of the tariffs on trade with America\u2019s closest trading partners.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIf you look at Mexico, I do some business in Mexico, the Peso fell apart. So suddenly we had this windfall from Peso. Kind of wanted to do more business. And then we got the deadline. Had to ship everything out really quickly. People don\u2019t realize that the currency sometimes is adjusting and there\u2019s a lot, it\u2019s much more difficult than people just think.\u201d Cramer added that the right approach to tariffs can be targeted tariffs. He believes \u201cIf you\u2019re not in favor of targeted tariffs where there\u2019s got to be some fair trade, I think you\u2019re just willing to have\u201d some of the largest and most important steel companies in America \u201cget wiped out\u201d due to cheap Chinese steel entering the US market via Mexico.\n\nHowever, just because targeted tariffs might be right for the steel industry doesn\u2019t mean broader tariffs are irrational. Cramer shared that \u201cso there is like, there\u2019s targeted, that\u2019s Navarro [who argues for targeted tariffs], and then there\u2019s just kind of like broad based . . .of we gotta solve the problem of why Nissan doesn\u2019t have more plants here. I don\u2019t it\u2019s so irrational. . . .It comes out a little irrationally, and then it\u2019s lumped in with some of the Ukraine things that I kind of don\u2019t wanna talk about because they seem a little . . .\u201d\n\nCramer remained focused on President Trump and also commented on his approval slipping according to a Reuters poll. The CNBC TV host outlined that while the poll might show that the President was becoming unpopular, \u201cat the same time, when you\u2019re with all these business executives that I was, at the Super Bowl, oh my. Oh my, I mean I\u2019m talking about people who\u2019re just saying, look, let\u2019s just tell you something Jim, this election occurred, we didn\u2019t expect it, we didn\u2019t like the guy. But wow, business is so good, we like the guy. That was the tone, and it was the tone for every industry. Didn\u2019t matter. . . I\u2019m talking about every single line of work, people saw a huge expansion in business except for homes.\u201d\n\nWhile the President ran a diametrically different election campaign to his predecessor\u2019s policies, his administration\u2019s approach to anti-trust cases is shaping up to be quite similar. Commenting on this peculiar phenomenon, Cramer shared:\n\n\u201cI think the people have to understand, that the, when I went through these last night, these are actually rules of law. They are not ideological, they are not meant to hurt business, they are meant to be able to include the worker. Interestingly enough Lina Khan did not do enough to include the worker. That\u2019s what, one of the things that said that to me, sent her way off base. But I do think that there was a neutrality to it that Democrats, Republicans, both don\u2019t want jobs to be lost. So I don\u2019t want people to think that it necessarily is going to lead to fewer mergers. But I would say, it\u2019s the tone. When I speak to CEOs, they don\u2019t expect to be subpoenaed, they don\u2019t expect some sort of lawsuit . . .and the idea of constructive dialogue with that, with the agreement of the legalese so to speak, is actually going to change things. It\u2019s constructive, it\u2019s no longer hateful.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 19th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 67\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of the largest fast-food chains in the world. Its shares have gained a modest 3.5% over the past year as the firm has struggled to recover from a 5% share price dip in October that followed an E. coli outbreak in its burgers. Ahead of the dip, McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)\u2019s shares had gained a modest 2.9% during the year as they were affected by inflation forcing consumers to switch to homemade meals or other alternatives. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD):\n\n\u201cYou know when you sit down with a guy like Chris Kempczinski, McDonald\u2019s. These guys are serious guys, and they have to deal with franchisees. And they got the price down. I mean I would complain to them about the seven dollar fifty cent egg McMuffin. I mean they are well aware that that is much, much, much above what it was. These companies have brought things down.\u201d\n\nOverall, MCD ranks 5th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of MCD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MCD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The has come in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER), an anti-affirmative action group.\n\nHACER scholarship history and impact\n\nThe HACER National Scholarship, created 40 years ago, has aided Hispanic and Latino high school seniors with college scholarships. Since its inception, the program has given away over $33 million in scholarships. This year more than 3,000 applications has been received.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLegal action and settlement\n\nThe AAER, led by Edward Blum, sued McDonald's in January, alleging that the scholarship's eligibility requirements, which mandate that applicants should have at least one Latino parent. This has discriminated against students of other ethnicities. The suit was filed on behalf of an Arkansas high school senior with a 3.8 GPA who couldn't apply due to her ethnicity.\n\nBlum was also a central figure in the Supreme Court 2023 decision to prohibit race-based college admissions. The AAER argues that race should not play a role in deciding educational opportunities.\n\nMcDonald's response and policy change\n\nAlthough McDonald's publicly countered the lawsuit's claims, the company settled and adjusted its scholarship requirements. Under the new criteria, students are no longer required to be of Latino heritage but must show a contribution to or commitment toward the Latino community.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMcDonald's also extended the HACER application deadline from February 6 to March 6 to enable more students to apply based on the new criteria.\n\nA broader shift in DEI policies\n\nThe policy change and lawsuit are part of wider shifts in corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. In the spring, McDonald's said it would end some DEI initiatives, such as diversity-oriented senior leadership recruitment targets and supplier diversity training programs.\n\nThough the company is committed to supporting Latino students, the widening of HACER's eligibility requirements is an acknowledgment of the changing landscape of affirmative action and corporate diversity policies.\n\nPublished By: Rivanshi Rakhrai Published On: Feb 21, 2025",

And, recently, he and his long-lost uncle, Uncle O\u2019Grimacey (who was first introduced in the 1970s in a rather terrifying ad campaign) announced the return of the beloved Shamrock Shake.\n\nA press release stated, \u201cThis Shamrock Season celebration came to life when Grimace stumbled upon his family\u2019s original Shamrock Shake recipe. That discovery sparked Grimace to reconnect with his vibrant, joyful, and generous uncle, Uncle O\u2019Grimacey.\u201d\n\nThe release continued, \u201cInspired to reunite with Grimace and support his favorite Charity\u2019s 50th milestone, Uncle O\u2019Grimacey packed his bags and embarked on a journey from Sham Rock, Ireland. Now that he\u2019s here, Uncle O\u2019Grimacey is traveling coast-to-coast, spreading Shamrock cheer with fans everywhere and celebrating RMHC and their mission to keep families together.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur fans eagerly await the Shamrock Shake each year. We are thrilled that proceeds from this minty-flavored treat will aid RMHC in keeping families together,\u201d said Joy Silmon, a second-generation McDonald\u2019s franchisee. \u201cFamily is a core value at McDonald\u2019s, and we live this every day. Together, with our Crew, customers, and iconic McDonaldland character, Uncle O\u2019Grimacey, we\u2019re helping RMHC make families feel at home, even when they can\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nFor those who wanted to openly show their affection for the Shamrock Shake while simultaneously raising money for RMHC, the fast-food giant released unique items depicting Uncle O\u2019Grimacey and other McDonald\u2019s classics. This merchandise was available for pre-order at goldenarchesunlimited.com, though it seems all items are currently sold out.

U.S. same-store sales fell 1.4 percent, though traffic increased slightly. McDonald\u2019s said it\u2019s pinning its hopes for sales growth on selling more chicken and more drinks, particularly at the drive-thru.\n\nRestaurant menu prices stabilize, if you ignore eggs\n\nRestaurant menu price inflation, meanwhile, eased in January, rising just 0.2%. That was less than half the inflation rate reported at grocery stores and other retailers. Nevertheless, food at home prices increased 1.9% over the past year, while restaurant prices climbed 3.4%. If you\u2019ve set foot in a grocery store in recent weeks, you likely know that egg prices are driving much of the grocery inflation right now. Egg prices spiked 15.2% in January compared to the month before.\n\nInfighting at a Twin Peaks franchise\n\nThere\u2019s some messiness happening within the operations of a Florida-based Twin Peaks franchisee. The group\u2019s former COO is suing his business partners, alleging a variety of fraudulent activities. But they leveled some of their own charges. Read on for the Long Island Iced Tea.\n\nDoes it come with a side of crinkle-cut fries?\n\nFast-growing fast-casual chain Dave\u2019s Hot Chicken is reportedly for sale, with the chain\u2019s investors hiring an investment bank to secure a deal. The celebrity-backed concept, which is nearing 300 locations following its start as a parking lot popup in 2017, is the leader in the increasingly crowded Nashville hot chicken segment.\n\nDenny\u2019s sees opportunity in virtual brands\n\nComeback plans at casual-dining stalwart Denny\u2019s seem to have slowed. The diner chain said it now plans to close as many as 90 underperforming restaurants this year, 30 more than previously expected. Amid the closures, Denny\u2019s is seeing opportunity in its three virtual brands, which it is hoping will continue to drive sales during dinner and late at night.\n\nICYMI\n\nCheck out this exclusive interview with Patrick Doyle, executive chairman of Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International.\n\nPiada Italian Street Food is racing to become a national brand.\n\nGolden Corral is building a tech stack fit for 2025.

Plus, a new chicken strip offering will be launched across the country, though we don\u2019t yet know what what form it will take.\n\nFor years, McDonald\u2019s chicken strip offering was the fan-favorite Chicken Selects, but it was discontinued in 2015. The chain introduced Buttermilk Crispy Tenders in 2017, but removed it from menus in 2020.\n\nMcDonald's Chicken Big Mac.\n\nBut the chain is remaining tight-lipped on the timing of these items: Representatives for McDonald\u2019s declined TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAnd when an analyst asked Kempczinski during the call when customers should expect the chicken strip\u2019s arrival or the Snack Wrap\u2019s relaunch, he didn\u2019t mince words.\n\n\u201cMy U.S. team would kill me if I gave any more details about the when and the exact specifics of how we\u2019re going to plan on doing that, but certainly expect that to come online later in the year,\u201d he said.\n\nSocial media is to thank for the return of the Snack Wrap\n\nBack on Dec. 5, Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald\u2019s USA, spoke to ABC News about the new McValue menu and confirmed the item\u2019s return, thrilling its extremely passionate group of fans.\n\n\u201cThe Snack Wrap will be back in 2025,\u201d Erlinger said. \u201cIt has a cult following, I get so many emails into my inbox about this product.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Erlinger declined to give a specific drop date \u201cfor competitive reasons.\u201d\n\nAccording to McDonald\u2019s senior marketing director Guillame Huin, we have social media to thank for its return.\n\n\u201cIf you ever wonder if your posts here matter, if they have an impact, if we even care, let me tell you something, you and you only with your countless posts and requests and petitions made it happen,\u201d Huin wrote on X. \u201cThey were in all our meetings, all our discussions, every single powerpoint to make a case for it. You won, snack wrap fans. Thank you.\u201d\n\nFor years, social media has led the charge to bring the Snack Wrap back. A Change.org petition started in 2021 garnered over 17,000 signatures, and multiple posts on X, Reddit, TikTok and beyond longed for the days of the Snack Wrap.\n\nHuin also said that Snack Wraps were \u201cBY FAR, our most requested items of all time.\u201d\n\nAs expected, people online wrapped the news around themselves like a warm flour tortilla.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s brin(g)ing the Snack Wrap back. I used to pray for times like this,\u201d posted one X user.\n\n\u201cI might actually cry,\u201d wrote another.\n\n\u201cBESTIES WAKE UP!!!! MCDONALDS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT SNACKWRAPS ARE BACK IN 2025!!!!!!!\u201d a TikTok user wrote while dancing in their car.\n\nPrior to McDonald\u2019s announcement, competitors tried their hand at achieving Snack Wrap-esque virality with the public, all with varying results.\n\nIn March 2023, Wendy\u2019s introduced a Grilled Chicken Ranch Wrap; in July 2023, Taco Bell brought back the Crispy Chicken Taco for a limited time (one X user said it tasted just like the Snack Wrap); and in August 2023, Burger King launched BK Royal Crispy Wraps for a limited time.\n\nThis article was originally published on TODAY.com",

Since last summer, brands, retailers, holding companies and, most recently the federal government, have been dismantling (or retooling) DEI initiatives, many of which were built up after the murder of George Floyd and subsequent Black Lives Matter Movement of 2020.\n\nThe \u201cdiversity\u201d portion of diversity, equity and inclusion has become divisive, impacting multicultural marketing agencies, Black-owned brands and diverse publications. And they\u2019re starting to feel the ripple effects, according to Kirk McDonald, CEO of Sundial Media Group, holding company for brands like Essence magazine, Afropunk festival and Refinery29.\n\nAlthough, he said, it\u2019s too early to tell the full impact DEI\u2019s retooling (or rebrand) will have on the industry in terms of media spend, marketing budgets or consumer habits.\n\nMcDonald recently sat down with the Digiday Podcast to talk about how Sundial\u2019s diverse publications, geared toward women and other historically marginalized communities, are navigating the pushback.\n\nThis conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nThe new general market\n\nBrands today, regardless of who you are, have to recognize that the current general market is not the old general market. The new general market is actually made up of a bunch of different communities. Its complexion has changed. It is in control of how it is perceived. Its genders aren\u2019t binary anymore, and that new general market that has said, \u201cThese are the ways that I show up,\u201d [and] will insist to brands, \u201cIf you want my dollars, you\u2019re gonna actually have to actually speak to me in my language and in a place, and in a way that I trust you.\u201d\n\nDEI: Rebrand or retool?\n\nRight now, we\u2019re going through a moment where we\u2019re trying to pretend that the programs that have been branded DEI, all of them were feel-good moments, and not recognizing that they really were opportunities about making commerce happen for the companies that were looking to meet the needs of communities uniquely going forward.\n\nImpacts on budgets and revenue\n\nThe reality is that we don\u2019t know yet. There\u2019s a lot of press announcements. All the press announcements have not actually gotten themselves all the way down to, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop spending this way and spend another way.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve now put a lot more effort, and we will continue to do this, in supporting that we sit in a place where we can bring unique insights into how our audiences behave. They speak differently because we speak their language, and I will bring that to brands and they will use that to activate, so we will continue doing that going forward.",

Jamie Davis Smith\n\nOn a recent trip to India, I went to Starbucks, Domino's, McDonald's, and Burger King.\n\nI would eat at Domino's and McDonald's more if they had similar menus in the US.\n\nMy Starbucks experience was similar to home, but it felt much more like a sit-down restaurant.\n\nOne of my favorite things about traveling is getting to try new foods.\n\nHowever, I often travel with my kids, who aren't very adventurous eaters. That means I find myself frequenting popular fast-food chains around the world more often than I'd like.\n\nOn a recent trip to India, we ended up at Starbucks, Domino's, McDonald's, and Burger King. In a way, seeing how the country adopted these familiar concepts was its own kind of cultural experience.\n\nHere's how the American fast-food chains' locations in India compared to ones we're used to in the US.\n\nThe first familiar chain we visited was Starbucks.\n\nI ordered my regular latte at Starbucks in India. Jamie Davis Smith\n\nOn my first morning in India, I desperately needed coffee, and I had a feeling Starbucks would be reliable and easy to navigate.\n\nWhen I walked in, it looked similar to almost every other location I've been to. The menu had many US standards, with some Indian-inspired drinks and food items mixed in, which I appreciated.\n\nI stuck to the basic latte I usually order at home. However, I was more adventurous when it came to my meal: a delicious masala potato puff.\n\nSitting down to eat at Starbucks isn't all that familiar to me.\n\nOur food came out on real plates at Starbucks. Jamie Davis Smith\n\nAfter ordering, I quickly realized there was a key difference between this Starbucks and the one down the street from my house. Instead of waiting around for my name to be called, I was told to take a seat, and my order would be brought out to me.\n\nDrinks were served in mugs and glasses rather than disposable cups, and meals came on dishes rather than in thin wrappers.\n\nI liked that my Starbucks experience in India felt more like a sit-down restaurant than a quick-service coffee shop.\n\nAnother notable departure is that the Starbucks I visited in Delhi didn't open as early as I expected.\n\nI assumed the chain accommodated morning caffeine fiends like myself everywhere in the world \u2014 many locations in the US open as early as 5 a.m. \u2014 but I had to wait for this Starbucks to open at 9 a.m.\n\nDomino's in India surprised me.\n\nI got a cheese volcano pizza at Domino's. Jamie Davis Smith\n\nI find Domino's locations in the US to be mediocre, but my kids love the chain. I was intrigued when I saw the American pizza place scattered throughout India, and eventually, we stopped at one.\n\nI had a hard time deciding between the peppy paneer, indi tandoor, and cheese volcano. I love cheese, though, so I went for the volcano, which included a huge cup of cheese in the center of a pizza topped with a variety of veggies.\n\nI really enjoyed it \u2014 I wish Domino's would bring volcano pizzas to the US.\n\nThe tables were turned when it came to who enjoyed Domino's more.\n\nMy son didn't love his kids' meal from Domino's, but we were excited to have it as an option. Jamie Davis Smith\n\nMy son ordered a kids' meal (which came with a drink and dessert) and stuck with his normal Margherita pizza.\n\nHe said it wasn't as good as Domino's at home because the crust didn't seem the same, but overall, he was happy. Domino's chains near us in the US don't even sell kids' meals, and he liked the novelty.\n\nI wish McDonald's back home had some of the Indian offerings.\n\nWe ordered some specialty items at McDonald's in India. Jamie Davis Smith\n\nMy family rarely eats at McDonald's in the US, but we went to two different locations in India. One was in an abandoned mall, and the other was in the upscale Connaught Place shopping area.\n\nThe ambiance at each was different, but the Indian-inspired menu was the same.\n\nOne of my biggest takeaways was that it felt odd to be at a McDonald's that didn't have hamburgers. Cows are considered sacred in Hinduism, the most common religion in India, so many places don't serve beef.\n\nInstead, the chain had chicken, potato, and veggie burgers. My kids and I shared a few different types, all of which we enjoyed.\n\nMy favorite was the McAloo tikki burger, which consisted of a patty made out of potato, peas, and spices topped with a tangy tomato-mayo. I'd go to McDonald's more often if it had something similar back home.\n\nMy pizza-loving son tried a McPuff. The pizza puff looked promising, but we ultimately deemed it mediocre.\n\nWe got special drinks at McDonald's, too.\n\nMy daughter got an orange soda with vanilla ice cream at McDonald's in India. Jamie Davis Smith\n\nMy kids and I shared fries and sodas at McDonald's that were nearly identical to what we have in the US. However, we also had the option to add ice cream to our drinks, which was new and exciting.\n\nMy daughter really enjoyed her orange soda with vanilla ice cream.\n\nBurger King had all sorts of unexpected menu items.\n\nI was surprised to see tacos on the Burger King menu in India. Jamie Davis Smith\n\nOn our final night, my son and I got takeout from Burger King and met friends who were eating at a nearby KFC. It seemed like an odd last dinner to have in India, but it was convenient and quick.\n\nSimilar to McDonald's, Burger King had a menu full of chicken patties and veggie burgers. The chain also served mutton in place of beef.\n\nThe menu included some locally inspired dishes, like a paneer wrap, but I was more surprised to see tacos and an extensive selection of desserts for sale.\n\nOur food was flavorful and good.\n\nI got a crispy vegetarian makhani burger at Burger King. Jamie Davis Smith\n\nI was tempted to try the tacos. However, my favorite curry in India was makhani dal, so I decided to try a crispy vegetarian makhani burger. It was very good.\n\nI paired my burger with cheese fries and a side of Fiery Hell Dip, which luckily wasn't as spicy as it sounded.\n\nI'm actually kind of glad my kids have made these fast-food visits a habit.\n\nIt's kind of fun to see how an American chain operates in other countries. Jamie Davis Smith\n\nI wouldn't want to eat every meal at American restaurants when I'm abroad. However, I have to admit occasional visits to familiar chains are fun.\n\nIt makes my kids happy, but more than that, I feel like paying attention to the little (or big) differences helps me learn a little more about our destination.\n\nPlus, it's always fun to try specialty items we can't get back at home.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

For this week\u2019s segment, we see how a special place served as a silver lining for a little boy\u2019s battle with cancer.\n\nSix-year-old Ryker Privett\u2019s battle with cancer found a silver lining at the Ronald McDonald House. This special place became his family\u2019s sanctuary during his fight against acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\nRyker\u2019s mother, Crystal Coyne, first suspected something was wrong when she noticed bruises on his legs.\n\n\u201cWe were going to the park twice a week,\u201d said Coyne. \u201cHe was starting to climb. He had a couple bruises on his legs. You don\u2019t think anything of it. It was probably the fourth or fifth week where there were a lot of bruises.\u201d\n\nDoctors diagnosed Ryker with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, beginning a two-and-a-half-year journey filled with chemotherapy.\n\n\u201cLots of chemo. There\u2019s multiple phases and cycles to go through, so none of them are easy,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Ronald McDonald House became a crucial part of their lives.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d have nothing to eat or drink after midnight,\u201d said Coyne. \u201cSo we\u2019d wake up this three-year-old who would be hungry with no food, nothing to eat; we\u2019d have an hour drive. He would be vomiting on the way in. He\u2019d be tired. Once we got there, he still couldn\u2019t eat. And then he would be put under because they would do lumbar puncture for his chemo.\u201d\n\nThe Ronald McDonald House provided a haven where chemo days started with a slumber party the night before.\n\n\u201cWe could play games, have a good dinner, get to bed and we would just wake up and hop right over to the hospital,\u201d Coyne said.\n\nThe convenience, home-cooked meals and support system offered small blessings during a challenging time.\n\n\u201cI really feel like the majority of this whole journey has been about finding that silver lining and what we can be very grateful for,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter more than 800 days, Ryker is finished with chemo and in remission. He promises to always return to visit.\n\n\u201cI am Ryker, and I\u2019m a miracle boy,\u201d he said.\n\nRyker\u2019s fond memories at the Ronald McDonald House highlight the importance of such places.\n\nThe Ronald McDonald House is located on the campus of Golisano Children\u2019s Hospital. They ask for a donation of $10 per night, but no one is ever turned away because of inability to pay.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to help support their mission by making a donation, you can find additional information here.\n\n",

This is unlike the McDouble, which was founded in 1996 and revamped to its current form in 2008, differing from a double cheeseburger by only including one slice of cheese compared to two. When trying the regular hamburger, which includes the same ingredients as the double minus an extra patty, we found it was easier to enjoy when there was less meat. It was less dry and there was more of a chance for the patty to absorb the ketchup.\n\nMcDonald's could have just had a bad day, which would explain the dryness and lack of ketchup. Sometimes it's simply the luck of the draw. Luckily, there are ways to improve the burger by asking for extra diced onions, pickles, and ketchup to mask the dryness and add more flavor, or getting other sauces on your own and putting them on the burger. However, a good burger shouldn't need all that. So, if you're looking for a simple plain double hamburger, McDonald's might not always be the place for you. But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy a double hamburger elsewhere, or even make your own from a multitude of recipes that won't take you too long and can yield lots of leftovers.",

(Show more)\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (McDonald\u2019s) is one of the world\u2019s largest and most recognized fast-food chains, known for its hamburgers, french fries, and name-brand sandwiches such as the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder, and Egg McMuffin, as well as the child-focused Happy Meal.\n\nBased in Chicago, it is one of the most successful brands in marketing history. From its modest beginnings in the 1940s as a drive-in restaurant, McDonald\u2019s has undergone several transformative eras marked by pioneering innovations, milestones, and periods of controversy. Business structure and charitable work Although McDonald\u2019s is an iconic fast food chain, it is also a real estate company. The company owns\u2014or has a long-term lease on\u2014the land and building for each franchised location. Each franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating, and decor. McDonald\u2019s Corporation\u2019s revenue is made up of rent, royalties, and fees paid by franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. It is also one of the world\u2019s largest private employers, with more than 150,000 company employees and 2,000,000 workers at franchised locations. The first Ronald McDonald House, which housed families near hospitals where their children were receiving cancer treatment, was opened In 1974. By the early 21st century, more than 360 such houses existed around the world. Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) was established in 1987. In 2022, McDonald\u2019s customers and franchisees donated over $182 million to RMHC, which provided 2.2 million overnight stays around the world. McDonald\u2019s Corporation itself donated $20 million to RMHC in 2022, part of a $100 million pledge. The company also donates millions of dollars to international relief efforts and local nonprofit organizations each year, and provides hundreds of thousands of dollars in community grants and scholarships. In 2022, more than $20 million was awarded in tuition assistance through the Archways to Opportunity program. 1940\u20131948: The birth of fast-food pioneers The first McDonald\u2019s drive-in was opened in 1940 by brothers Maurice (\u201cMac\u201d) and Richard McDonald in San Bernardino, California. In 1948 the brothers revamped the business, and a newly envisioned McDonald\u2019s restaurant was created to produce huge quantities of food at low prices. The brothers developed a simple, efficient format that they named the Speedee Service System, including a self-service counter that eliminated the need for waiters and waitresses. By 1949, the menu was condensed to include 15-cent hamburgers, shakes, and fries. Customers received their food quickly because hamburgers were cooked ahead of time, wrapped, and warmed under heat lamps. McDonald\u2019s was a huge success, and the brothers began a franchise program of 10 restaurants plus their original San Bernardino location. 1954\u20131961: The Ray Kroc revolution\n\nOpen full sized image Everett/Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 1954, Ray Kroc, a distributor for a special milkshake mixing machine, was intrigued by the McDonald brothers\u2019 need for eight mixers. Realizing there was great promise in their restaurant concept, Kroc became a franchise agent for the brothers. In April 1955, Kroc launched McDonald\u2019s Systems, Inc., later known as McDonald\u2019s Corporation, in Des Plaines, Illinois, where he also opened the first McDonald\u2019s franchise east of the Mississippi River. In 1961 Kroc bought out the McDonald brothers. 1961\u20131975: Standardization and expansion Realizing that franchisees were vital to the company\u2019s success, Kroc developed exacting standards for how each McDonald\u2019s should be run, from food preparation to cleaning. To ensure the standardized operation of the outlets, he created a program in 1961, later known as Hamburger University, to train franchisees. In addition, he eventually changed the format of the restaurants, adding counter staff to take orders.\n\nOpen full sized image Ronald McDonald, the mascot of McDonald's. \u00a9 Marynaanna/Dreamstime.com\n\nDuring this time McDonald\u2019s also introduced features that would define its brand and further public recognition: In 1963, the public face of the company was introduced, a clown named Ronald McDonald; however, criticism over marketing to children and the growing negative perception of clowns resulted in the company largely sidelining the character in the early 21st century.\n\nIn 1968, McDonald\u2019s added the Big Mac to its national menu; the iconic hamburger went on to reportedly become the company\u2019s top-selling item after french fries.\n\nDuring the 1960s the chain refined its logo, eventually debuting the famous double-arch M design, which became its enduring symbol and one of the most famous logos in the world; it was inspired by the tall yellow arches that had dominated earlier McDonald\u2019s restaurant rooftops.\n\ndesign, which became its enduring symbol and one of the most famous logos in the world; it was inspired by the tall yellow arches that had dominated earlier McDonald\u2019s restaurant rooftops. In 1975 a McDonald\u2019s in Arizona opened the chain\u2019s first drive-through window, a feature that soon became ubiquitous. These changes helped spur McDonald\u2019s growth. In less than 10 years after Kroc became the sole owner of McDonald\u2019s, the number of the chain\u2019s outlets topped 1,000. Boosted by these numbers, the company\u2019s stock began trading publicly in 1965. 1980s\u20131990s: Global dominance and diverse menu The chain continued to expand domestically and internationally. In 1967 a franchise opened in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada, McDonald\u2019s first location outside the United States. By the early 21st century, there were some 34,000 outlets operating in more than 115 countries and territories. Growth was so swift in the 1990s that it was said a new McDonald\u2019s opened somewhere in the world every five hours. It effectively became the most popular family restaurant by emphasizing affordable food, fun, and flavors that appealed to children and adults alike.\n\nOpen full sized image McDonald's restaurant, Marrakech, Morocco. \u00a9 Michael Hynes\n\nOver the years McDonald\u2019s also expanded its menu. In addition, restaurants in foreign countries also adapted their menus to appeal to local customs and tastes.

However, by late 2008 McDonald\u2019s no longer owned or had a stake in any of those companies, instead concentrating on its own brand. 2000s: Facing challenges and criticisms The success of McDonald\u2019s brought increased criticism, much of which concerned its perceived association with a global increase in obesity. In the early 2000s various lawsuits were filed against the company in the United States, alleging that its food caused health problems. Although none of the plaintiffs prevailed, a number of states passed bills banning obesity lawsuits against fast-food companies. McDonald\u2019s also experienced a backlash following the popular documentary Super Size Me (2004), in which the filmmaker saw his health drastically decline while on a diet of only McDonald\u2019s foods. McDonald\u2019s responded to the criticism by adding healthy items to its menu, and it began developing a vegan \u201chamburger,\u201d variations of which would appear under such names as McVegan, P.L.T., and McPlant. In addition, in 2018 McDonald\u2019s announced that it had stopped using preservatives in most of its hamburgers. During this time the company also eliminated supersize portions, and its U.S. and Canadian restaurants stopped using trans fat in a number of items. Such measures, however, did little to stem health concerns. As one of the world\u2019s largest private employers, McDonald\u2019s faced numerous calls to increase wages. The term McJob was added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary to mean \u201clow-paying job.\u201d The company was criticized for its negative impact on the environment, especially its contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. In the early 21st century, McDonald\u2019s launched initiatives to reduce emissions at its restaurants and in its suppliers\u2019 production of beef. In addition, the company\u2019s packaging was a source of concern, and during this time McDonald\u2019s launched a program to move toward renewable or recycled bags, utensils, and other items. Amid the controversy, however, McDonald\u2019s Corporation continues to grow internationally and domestically, continuing the core strengths established by Ray Kroc: delivering fast food at value prices and in a friendly atmosphere, with aggressive marketing of its restaurants. Its 2020s strategy calls this \u201cCommitting to the Core,\u201d with a focus on what it calls the 4 Ds: Digital, delivery, drive-through, and (restaurant) development.",

            "content": "Restaurants have notoriously low profit margins. But McDonald's (MCD 0.86%), the world's largest restaurant chain, is surprisingly one of the most profitable businesses. In fact, its profit margins are higher than prestigious businesses such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX).\n\nI should clarify that profits can be measured from multiple angles. But one of the best ways to measure profits is with the operating margin. This metric excludes things that aren't related to regular business operations -- such as taxes, which can swing wildly from year to year -- and focuses only on the profits the business produces.\n\nOn Feb. 10, McDonald's reported finalized financial results for 2024. During the year, the company had a stellar operating margin of 45%. That's among the very best in the world. And as the chart below shows, it's far better than the operating margin for companies such as Tesla, Apple, and Netflix.\n\nAssuming that the core business is burgers and fries, it would seem that McDonald's makes $45 in operating profit for every $100 it has in sales. This would suggest that its food is outrageously overpriced. But if you assume that selling food is the core business for McDonald's, you're wrong.\n\nMcDonald's has operating margins as good or better than even the most profitable tech companies because it's not in the food business per se. And it's a really interesting thing for investors to note, as I'll explain.\n\nThe secret sauce for McDonald's\n\nAs of this writing, I'm still waiting on McDonald's to file its annual report, which contains more detailed financials than what it usually reports to investors. So allow me to mention some 2023 numbers for illustrative purposes. In 2023, McDonald's generated total revenue of $25.5 billion. Of this, it generated $15.4 billion (over 60% of its total revenue) from its franchised restaurants -- restaurants operated by independent third parties.\n\nThe bulk of franchised revenue for McDonald's comes from a particularly surprising source. As it turns out, the company owns a lot of real estate that it rents out to its franchises. It generated $9.8 billion in rental income in 2023.\n\nMcDonald's had over $27 billion in real estate at the end of 2023, when looking at land that it owned and buildings that were on land that it owned. This gives McDonald's the largest real estate portfolio of any restaurant company in the world. And this dynamic goes a long way to explaining why it has operating margins that are so high compared to other restaurant chains.\n\nIn other words, McDonald's primarily offers third-party franchisees an opportunity to run a restaurant business. The company provides franchisees with the brand, the system, and even the building. The franchisees sell the classic burgers and fries, which is a much lower-margin business. But the parent company gets royalties and rental income, which is so high-margin that even software companies are jealous.\n\nWhat does this mean for investors today?\n\nMcDonald's expects its operating margin to further improve in 2025. And even a modest improvement could still result in a large increase in operating profits given how massive the business is.\n\nAnother interesting thing to consider is that McDonald's has around 43,000 restaurant locations today but expects to surpass 50,000 in 2027. That's a 16% increase in just three years, which is pretty meaningful for a business of this size. And since most of the growth will come from franchisees, expect a respectable increase in its high-margin revenue streams.\n\nGiven how big and high-margin this business is, I consider McDonald's stock as one of the safest investments someone could make -- in other words, I believe there's a low chance of losing money over the long term. Given McDonald's size, I'd say it doesn't necessarily have the highest upside potential. But it could still be worth holding, and it's worth watching in case the price ever dips to a particularly attractive valuation.",

After all, a 1,000% percent return, the old 10-bagger, is pretty spectacular. So is 5,000% ( Google ) or 25,000% (Starbucks) or 50,000% (Nike).\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

And with a comfortable retirement often measured in multiples of $1 million, a return of 100,000% will send many savers well on their way to financial security. For others, retirement is the penultimate goal. Primarily, they want to pass wealth on to their children and grandchildren.\n\nImagine passing on $1 million to a grandchild who uses it to start a business that ultimately returns 100,000%? Or another grandchild who finds, say, the next Walmart and earns 300,000% and turns the grandparents' $1,000 into $3 billion in just three generations. That a billion-dollar fortune could be amassed with passive investments is testimony of the strength and opportunity of our country as well as the skill and dedication of American workers and management.\n\nNotably, a 100,000% return is not rare. The list of stocks featured in this series is not exhaustive, but it is well-researched. You may well find other stocks that have reached this milestone. For instance, Netflix has since crossed the 100,000% threshold since we did this research.\n\nAlso, you may come across stocks where the reported returns are at odds with what we have found in our research. There is differing data out there on popular stock platforms. We dug deeply, however, conducting custom price performance searches that extended beyond what is typically reported to produce this list.\n\nIn addition to being fairly prevalent, it should \u2013 no must \u2013 be noted these opportunities are completely accessible. Anyone with $1,000 who is willing to put it at risk can enter the fray.\n\nOne obstacle to turning say $10,000 into $10 million is the success that unfolds along the way. If a holding of say Home Depot goes from $10,000 to $5 million, and this $5 million constitutes 67% of the investor's $7.5 million portfolio, it sets up a situation that is difficult for their adviser.\n\nIf the client, upon advice, sells half of their position, and the Home Depot return climbs to 100,000%, then the client misses out on $2.5 million of gains. If the adviser tells the client to hang in there, which I would never do, and the company implodes, the investor could lose everything. Ultimately, when gains reach these levels, the decision to sell often comes down to the tax impact of taking say a $2 million long-term capital gain .\n\nOver the course of this series, we will feature the stories of these companies and some reasons they reached great heights. One note of caution is merited, however. Not all, but many of the companies in this series got there through making many acquisitions, and you might be left with the impression that the path to 100,000% returns goes through M&A. It doesn't.\n\nThe companies in this series that have grown through mergers and acquisitions are very, very good at it. But integrating a company that has been acquired presents challenges that can get the better of even the most skilled management teams. I'd speculate that mergers and acquisitions are the demise of more companies than their salvation by a factor of 100. So, when you go looking for the next member of the 100,000% club, be wary of candidates that are buying their way to growth, and keep their fundamentals in mind.\n\nAlso of importance: the returns shown below come from share appreciation. It does not include the return from dividends, i.e. the returns we cite are not the total return. Many, older established companies such as Walmart pay regular dividends and grow them . Not all of them do, however. For instance, Amazon does not.\n\nHowever, for companies that do pay dividends, the contribution they make to the total return can be truly spectacular. Corroborating proof of the contribution that dividends make to the total return, is that, over the long haul, dividends have contributed about 40% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index.\n\nIn good years, the 1.8% average yield on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index does not seem material. But accounting for the lean years, and the years with losses, the dividends turn out to be a major component of the total return investors enjoy in S&P 500 stocks.\n\nAccordingly then, for the companies featured in our 100,000% club, the return for the dividend payers is at least 100,000% and in some cases, this is a conservative estimate.\n\nMcDonald's stock: Small changes drive big returns\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) just gained entry into the 100,000% club. As of the end of 2024, it was hovering at about 99,000%.\n\nThe primary reason that MCD has returned share appreciation of 100,000% is that their business model has been profitably honed since Ray Kroc took over from the McDonald brothers in 1961. For more than 60 years the company has continuously made incremental improvements. Though small in the sense that they have added just basis points to profitability in some cases, these basis points have added up to material improvements in profitability over the decades.\n\nTo see the impact of incremental improvement over time, consider that McDonald's operating margin has grown from 35% in 2014 to 53% in 2024. And beneath these improvements, McDonald's market will always be there \u2013 people need to eat \u2013 and it is always growing. Consumers might abandon gas-powered cars for electric vehicles (EVs) delivering a decline in profitability to the likes of Ford, but abandoning dinner? Never.\n\nWhat are some of these incremental changes? Breakfast all day, dollar menu items, Happy Meals for kids, the Big Arch burger (largest ever), additional drive-through lanes, fresh rather than frozen patties, reducing food waste, self-serve beverages and kiosk ordering.\n\nIt doesn't always take breakthroughs in technology to create and then dominate new markets. Sometimes continuous improvement in processes will deliver continuous improvement in profitability, and over time, a return of 100,000%.\n\nNote: This content first appeared in Louis Navellier's latest book, The Sacred Truths of Investing: Finding Growth Stocks that Will Make You Rich , which was published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

He is accused in court documents of holding a gun to the heads, backs or stomachs of cashiers and demanding money from cash registers and safes.\n\nAfter the robberies, Pickens would leave through a back door of the business and flee the scene in a black Chevrolet Tahoe. During a similar robbery at another McDonald\u2019s location on Jan. 23 last year, Pickens was arrested on the scene.\n\nDuring a sentence hearing in court last year, Pickens threw a full water bottle at the prosecution table and at the lead case agent. The man also apparently fought with officers in the courtroom, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cJudge Hittner said he believes Pickens to be a true danger to the public and recommended he be placed in a maximum security prison,\u201d according to the office.",

            "content": "February 14, 2025\n\nAfter a tepid Q4 earnings report that saw McDonald\u2019s miss a few key metrics, namely same-store sales open at least a year (down 1.4%), flat net sales, and an expectations miss in terms of overall revenue ($6.39 billion versus $6.44 projected by Wall Street), it appears that a simple focus on value proposition may not be enough to drive significant growth.\n\nNow, as Quartz detailed, it appears that the red-and-yellow brand is pivoting to chicken menu offerings \u2014 as well as a return of some nostalgic promos \u2014 in order to recapture consumer interest.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Brings Back Chicken Snack Wrap, Launches Chicken Strips, and Continues To Advertise McCrispy and Chicken Big Mac\n\nOne of the biggest pieces of news for fans of the Golden Arches was the reintroduction of the restaurant chain\u2019s beloved Chicken Snack Wrap to menus nationwide. During a Feb. 10 earnings call, via a transcription provided by The Motley Fool, president and CEO Chris Kempczinski briefly touched upon the high level of interest surrounding the snack wrap\u2019s return.\n\n\u201cThis year, there is incredible energy for the return of Snack Wraps in the U.S., along with a few other markets,\u201d Kempczinski said.\n\nImmediately afterward, the McDonald\u2019s CEO outlined the launch of a chicken strip menu offering coming in the near future and spoke to the usage of the company\u2019s popular Big Mac variant \u2014 the Chicken Big Mac \u2014 as a periodic attraction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to pulse in the Chicken Big Mac as a limited-time-only offering over time. In 2024, the Chicken Big Mac helped generate chicken market share growth in France and the U.S.,\u201d he added.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has had some success with chicken strips in the past, according to Mashed. The Chicken Selects were a hit during a nearly 10-year original run, as were the Buttermilk Crispy Tenders put forth in 2017. The COVID-19 pandemic curtailed the running time of the latter, but it appears that McDonald\u2019s is ramping up for a third kick at the can.\n\nFinally, Kempczinski reiterated that McDonald\u2019s would continue its rollout of the McCrispy sandwich, which features an all-white meat chicken fillet \u2014 as opposed to the chopped and blended McChicken staple \u2014 as well as a buttered potato bun.\n\n\u201cWe continue to roll out McCrispy, which is now in over 70 markets and will be available in nearly all markets by the end of 2025,\u201d the CEO stated.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s and Other Fast-Food Restaurants Turn to Chicken as Price of Beef Rises\n\nThere may also be another motivating factor for McDonald\u2019s to pivot toward a chicken-heavy menu besides appealing to consumer tastes: The price of chicken is very attractive compared to the price of beef.\n\nPer a December 2024 report from The Washington Post, this latest push by the Golden Arches is emblematic of a longstanding trend of fast-food restaurants adopting more chicken-based offerings. Chicken is a convenient protein to prepare and is much less costly than its beef counterparts.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m a restaurant or a chain, I\u2019ve got to put a meal in front of people they can afford,\u201d said David Anderson, a livestock economist at Texas A&M University. \u201cIf I want to put something on a menu to reduce my costs, it makes a lot of sense to put a chicken item out there.\u201d\n\nAnderson indicated that, at the time, the price of a fresh, whole chicken in the U.S. was $1.99 a pound, versus about $5.59 per pound of ground beef.\n\nGesturing toward increased labor costs and persistent inflationary pressures affecting corporations and consumers alike, the Washington Post report suggested it was logical for McDonald\u2019s, and other restaurant brands, to move toward chicken as a result.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s chicken market is twice the size of beef and growing much faster, executives said in their most recent investor call. The fast-food giant serves about 300 million pounds of chicken each year, and its sales are now equally split between chicken and beef,\u201d Washington Post reporter Hannah Ziegler wrote.\n\n\u201cNew chicken products contributed to 3 percent revenue growth and a slight same-store sales increase in the United States for the company during the third quarter,\u201d she added.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s was joined by both Burger King as well as Shake Shack in buffing up the number of chicken-based menu items last year, with the latter running a promotion for a free chicken sandwich with any purchase of $10 or more on Sundays. Burger King, on the other hand, built upon its launch of crispy chicken snack wraps with a Fiery Royal Chicken Sandwich and Fiery Chicken Fries last summer.",

Here\u2019s what we know so far\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption McDonald's posts biggest US sales decline in nearly five years McDonald's posted its biggest US sales decline in nearly five years on Monday (Feb 10). Demand took a hit from a brief E.coli outbreak, while diners also proved cautious spenders. Comparable sales in the U.S. fell 1.4% in the fourth quarter.\n\nMcDonald's is bringing back a fan favorite, the Snack Wrap soon \u2026 but not just yet.\n\nThe fast food chain's CEO, Christopher Kempczinski said earlier this week, \"This year, there is incredible energy for the return of Snack Wraps in the U.S., along with a few other markets,\" in discussing McDonald's plans and its fourth quarter financial performance with investment analysts.\n\nBack in December, Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald\u2019s U.S. operations, said on \"Good Morning America\" that the Snack Wrap would return in 2025. \u201cIt has a cult following. I get so many emails into my inbox about this product,\u201d he said.\n\nHere's what we know about the return of the Snack Wrap and more chicken products coming to McDonald's.\n\nWhen is the Snack Wrap coming back?\n\nKempczinski would not say exactly when Snack Wraps would return, but said they would be available later this year.\n\nWhen McDonald posted a teaser on X, the social platform previously known as Twitter, last year, it simply said, \"snack wraps xx.xx.2025\".\n\nWhat is a McDonald's Snack Wrap?\n\nThe Snack Wrap first hit the McDonald's menu in 2006. Over the next decade, it would have \"several different iterations,\" according to the Food Network, but its main ingredients were chicken breast meat (grilled or crispy), lettuce, cheese and sauce, in a soft flour tortilla. The item was discontinued 2016, but some restaurants continued to offer it until 2020 when it was taken off the menu to simplify McDonald's offerings during the COVID-19 pandemic, the outlet said.\n\nMore in store for McDonald's 'chicken portfolio'\n\nGoing forward consumers can expect more chicken menu items to expand McDonald's \"chicken portfolio,\" Kempczinski said during the conference call on Monday. \"A new chicken strip offering\" will be launched in the U.S. and the Chicken Big Mac will return as a limited time-only offering, he said.\n\nScam alert: Did you receive a text about unpaid road toll bills? It could be a scam: What to know\n\n$5 Meal Deal has been a success\n\nThe continued availability of the $5 Meal Deal is \"driving other purchases,\" Kempczinski said. The spending on an average order in the U.S. that includes a $5 Meal Deal is more than $10, he said. \"So it's doing what we were hoping for when we launched that.\"\n\nThe fast food giant saw sales in the U.S. fall 1.4% during the fourth quarter, during which the company faced an E.coli outbreak linked to onions on quarter pounders, which led to at least one death.\n\nBut global same-store sales increased 0.4% in the quarter. Many analysts are bullish on McDonald's, which has seen its shares rise nearly 7% so fare this year.\n\nMcDonald's Angel Reese Special meal\n\nNew to the menu this week is the Angel Reese Special, which includes a BBQ Bacon Quarter Pounder with Cheese topped with a new BBQ sauce, plus French fries and a drink. The meal is a collaboration with Reese, who is currently playing for the Rose Basketball Club in the new three-on-three Unrivaled league.\n\nMcDonald's Pok\u00e9mon Happy Meal\n\nAlso available through late February are Pok\u00e9mon-themed Happy Meals, which include a booster pack with four of 15 Pok\u00e9mon cards, a Pok\u00e9mon poster and a sticker sheet they can use to decorate the poster. If you order through the McDonald\u2019s app, you can also get 24-pack hourglasses and 12 wonder hourglasses to use in the mobile Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game.\n\nShamrock Shakes are back at McDonald's\n\nAlso available now is the Shamrock Shake, which returned to the menu earlier this week, joined by the Oreo Shamrock McFlurry. As in years past, McDonald's will donate 25 cents per Shamrock Shake purchased through March 23 to Ronald McDonald House Charities.\n\nContributing: Greta Cross and Saleen Martin.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Threads, Bluesky and X: mikegsnider & @mikegsnider.bsky.social & @mikesnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Leah Gann, a nurse practitioner from Jasper, shared her family's experience after her daughter, Gracie, was admitted to the hospital on December 23 for status epilepticus.\n\n\"My daughter Gracie was admitted to Children's Hospital for a seizure that lasted over an hour,\" Gann said. \"She was on the ventilator for ten days and then in the PICU for 11 and a half days. Along the way, she was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.\"\n\nGracie's health challenges continued with a blood clot and other complications, requiring her to relearn basic skills such as walking, talking, and eating. During this difficult time, the Gann family found a temporary home at the Ronald McDonald House.\n\n\"If we didn't have the RM House, we'd be driving three hours a day plus three hours of therapy,\" Gann said. \"It allows us to be together as a family.\"\n\nGracie attends therapy appointments three to five days a week, along with regular medical follow-ups. Gann emphasized the importance of family unity during this challenging period.\n\n\"It's really traumatic when you see your little sister code,\" she said. \"Having the whole family together intermittently has helped immensely.\"\n\nKatherine Estes Billmeier, president and CEO of Ronald McDonald House Charities of Alabama, highlighted the organization's mission to support families during their most difficult times.\n\n\"Our mission is to serve families who are being treated at area hospitals,\" Billmeier said. \"We not only want to provide a roof over their head but also the comfort and happiness of a home in a difficult time.\"\n\nThe Ronald McDonald House offers hot meals daily and personal touches that make a significant difference for families. Gann noted the impact of small gestures, such as allowing her children to pick out a toy at the store.\n\n\"Even little things like letting my girls go to the store and pick out a toy made their day,\" Gann said. \"Allowing us some normalcy after the biggest traumatic event that's happened in any of our lives\u2014there aren't words.\"\n\nBillmeier considers the families she serves as part of her own and is committed to alleviating their pain and worry.\n\n\"When a child is sick, the whole family is sick,\" she said. \"We are here not only to provide for the child who may be inpatient or staying with us but to ensure that the child's sibling is also getting the care and support they need.\"\n\nFamilies from around the world come to Birmingham for the specialized programs at Children's of Alabama, which are not available elsewhere. Despite the challenges, Billmeier sees resilience in the families and patients.\n\n\"They provide a sense of hope and happiness and joy in the living of every single day,\" she said. \"We have to live life one moment at a time and enjoy it, and they are examples for me.\"",

            "content": "Richard Thornton McDonald, a beloved husband, father, and grandfather, died peacefully at his home Thursday after a long illness. He was 89 years old.\n\nRich was born on June 14, 1935, to Joseph and Irene McDonald and grew up in Maplewood, New Jersey, the middle of three boys. He went to Seton Hall Prep and then to Seton Hall University, where he studied theology before joining the seminary. He was ordained as a Catholic priest in May 1961 and was a curate first at the Church of the Guardian Angel in Allendale, then at Saint Rose of Lima in Newark.\n\nThe 1960s were a tumultuous time for Newark, but Rich loved working there. A friend later said Rich was one of the few priests in the parish who walked around the neighborhood, talking to the people who lived there whether they went to Saint Rose or not. And when he saw something wrong, he did something about it.\n\nHe helped start a youth center named after Saint Martin de Porres, the first American Black saint, and, when he learned the parish\u2019s drum and bugle corps did not let a lot of Black children join, started one for them and named it Saint Martin\u2019s Troubadoures. During the Newark rebellion in 1967, when a bus company wouldn\u2019t drive into Newark to take the troupe to a competition, Rich marched them about a dozen blocks up Orange Street to meet the bus in East Orange. They were in full uniform and played the whole time.\n\n\u201cWe did get some stares from people driving up on the street,\u201d he said much later when retelling the story, one of his favorite anecdotes from his time in Newark.\n\nIt was in Newark where Rich met the love of his life, Patricia Ann. They married in 1970 and they remained together until he breathed his last breath, more than 54 years. They raised five children: Dennis, Amy, Tara, Terrence, and Maura. As much as he loved being a priest, he loved being a husband and father more, even if raising five children meant he had an array of jobs to put food on the table. He worked as a drug and alcohol counselor, handled addiction services for the state of New Jersey, moonlighted once as a cashier at Rickel, and even delivered newspapers before dawn. No job was too small.\n\nHe never lost his sense of humor. If you worked with him and he needed a favor from you, you were his \u201cnew best friend.\u201d If you were his children and he was driving you to school, he\u2019d blast classical music on the radio and pretend to be conducting it just to embarrass you. If you were a nurse who did something nice for him, he\u2019d tell you to take the rest of the day off.\n\nRich is survived by Patricia Ann; Dennis and Valerie Thompson; Amy; Tara and Tara Caulder; Terrence and Greg Kahn; and Maura and Michael Toal, as well as by his three grandchildren, Nico, Erin, and Cillian, and countless friends and family members. He will be missed.",

            "content": "McDonald's (MCD 0.86%) and its golden arches are known the world over. There are nuances to the menu, depending on the country in which you find a McDonald's restaurant, but broadly speaking, every location is pretty much the same. That consistency is part of the draw and it has helped the chain generate success for several decades now.\n\nMcDonald's shareholders have benefited from this success over the years, with many good years and occasional bad ones as the company adjusts to a changing economy. That has investors wondering what to do with the stock of this iconic fast food chain now. Is it a buy, sell, or a hold?\n\nThe case for selling McDonald's stock\n\nThe reason why you might want to sell or not buy McDonald's is the easiest argument to explain right now. To sum it up, the company isn't exactly performing well, management is basically warning that its core customers are under some financial strain, and the stock price is, at best, reasonably priced, historically speaking.\n\nUnless financial performance suddenly ticks higher, it seems like there's more downside risk than upside potential right now. But some numbers will help explain all of this.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, same-store sales, a measure that shows how well stores open at least a year are performing, jumped a tiny 0.4% across McDonald's global store footprint. The U.S. business, arguably its most important, saw same-store sales fall a troubling 1.4%. These are not impressive numbers, hinting that McDonald's isn't exactly knocking it out of the park today.\n\nThe store-level performance backs up against management's third-quarter 2024 comment that, \"We will stay laser-focused on providing an unparalleled experience with simple, everyday value and affordability that our consumers can count on as they continue to be mindful about their spending.\" That was the very first thing that CEO Chris Kempczinski said in the company's third-quarter earnings release, kind of setting the stage for a weak fourth quarter. While the company tried to accentuate the positives in the fourth-quarter earnings release, it is clear that McDonald's is facing near-term headwinds.\n\nAnd then you have to look at McDonald's valuation. You might be able to justify buying despite the bad news if the stock were on the deep-value rack. But the price-to-sales ratio is above its five-year average, while the price-to-earnings ratio is a bit below its long-term average.\n\nThe stock price, meanwhile, rallied on its fourth-quarter results, presumably because they weren't as bad as expected. The shares now trade within 5% of their all-time high, which was reached in mid-2024. Note that the shares have seen 25% or greater drawdowns multiple times over the past few decades, suggesting that McDonald's is nowhere near on sale right now.\n\nTaking profits or, if you don't own it, not buying it seems like a pretty logical decision here.\n\nThe case for holding McDonald's stock\n\nWhat if you do own McDonald's and you happen to like the company's business? Well, it isn't cheap today, but selling it might not make sense for you. It doesn't seem like the stock is massively overpriced (based on the mixed P/E and P/S ratio signals), and the business, like all businesses, is bound to go through both good and bad periods.\n\nThe fact that it is facing some difficulties right now isn't a sign that McDonald's has permanently lost its way. Indeed, given the statements about its core customers dealing with financial constraints, you could argue that McDonald's is actually performing reasonably well during a difficult period.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with sticking it out with a generally well-run company if you think in decades and not days. Investing for the long term inherently means you'll have to sit out periods of business weakness. Recognize that McDonald's size probably means slow and steady growth is the best you can expect.\n\nBut also note that the stock is likely to become a Dividend King very soon (the annual streak of dividend increases is at 49 years), so it clearly has a good business model and places a high value on returning value to investors via regular dividend increases. And the dividend yield is 2.4%, which is roughly twice what you'd get from the S&P 500.\n\nSticking it out with McDonald's probably isn't the worst investment decision you could make -- as long as you recognize that a sizable drawdown, at some point, is highly likely.\n\nThe case for buying McDonald's stock\n\nThe decision to buy McDonald's stock is a bit trickier. As noted, the shares aren't exactly cheap, and recent business performance hasn't been great. The outlook isn't exactly impressive either, since McDonald's core customers appear to be facing financial constraints, and that's clearly showing up in the same-store sales figures.\n\nGiven that the stock has experienced numerous pullbacks of 25% or more over the past 40 years, there is probably going to be a better time to buy at some point in the future. Unless you expect a sudden turnaround in the business outlook and the company's financial performance, you probably shouldn't buy in today.\n\nMcDonald's is a tough company to buy today\n\nThe buy thesis is probably the weakest when it comes to McDonald's stock. But differentiating between sell and hold isn't an easy call. The business environment seems to be getting more difficult for this giant restaurant chain, but that's kind of how things go from time to time.\n\nIf you are a long-term investor, you'll need to have a thick enough skin to stick out such periods. That said, not buying McDonald's might be the easiest choice here. It isn't hitting on all cylinders, the company has a downbeat outlook regarding its core customers, and the price isn't all that cheap.",

In January, McDonald\u2019s launched its McValue menu, offering a \u201cBuy One, Add One for Just a $1\" deal, along with its popular $5 meal deal, which debuted in June 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese efforts aim to attract customers budget-conscious customers as rising costs persist. Other fast food chains, including Burger King, Wendy\u2019s, and Taco Bell, have also rolled out similar deals to stay competitive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile many are seeking affordable options, the rise in healthier eating habits \u2014 partly driven by the boo, in weight loss drugs like Ozempic (NVO+1.41% ) \u2014 may also be pushing adults toward smaller portions, such as kids\u2019 meals.\n\nTara Lewis, Yelp\u2019s (YELP+2.32% ) vice president, told the Wall Street Journal (NWSA+2.72% ) that cheaper prices and fewer calories are why she opts for McDonald\u2019s kids menu, adding that she can enjoy the fries \u201cwithout the debt or the damage\u201d to her diet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to value-driven items, McDonald\u2019s continues to innovate with seasonal offerings. In February, the much-anticipated Shamrock Shake returned, aligning with the chain\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report, which fell below Wall Street\u2019s expectations \u2014 largely due to the lingering effects of the 2024 E. coli outbreak. To remedy the damage, McDonald\u2019s announced a $100 million investment in marketing and franchisee support.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s also has big plans for chicken.

A symbol of the American Dream going up in smoke, alongside the homes of the rich and famous, showed how inescapable climate change\u2019s worst impacts are, even for the privileged.\n\nIndeed, scientists have since confirmed that climate change made the fires more likely.\n\nThe wildfires are now fully contained, but the enduring image of a burning McDonald\u2019s should also act as another powerful symbol \u2013 the role the food system, in particular meat and dairy production, plays in fuelling climate change.\n\nFood is responsible for around a third of global greenhouse gas emissions but is often overlooked in emissions reduction strategies. With corporate leadership from the likes of McDonald\u2019s, and political will, its impact could be minimized with wins for the climate and human health.\n\nThe fires are the latest in a pattern of climate impacts increasing in intensity and devastation.\n\nAnd as cries for climate action from some quarters multiply, we should not overlook the huge impact that the food system plays in heating the planet. The proportion of emissions from food production will grow as emissions from energy and transport reduce in a green transition.\n\nLivestock emissions problem\n\nOver the past 25 years of climate action, the food system has often been forgotten \u2013 and therefore strategies to limit its impact are far behind where they need to be, despite solutions being literally on the table.\n\nThe greatest contributor to food\u2019s climate gases is the production and consumption of livestock. According to calculations based on IPCC figures and other research, the livestock sector alone may be responsible for around 20% of all climate emissions.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest meat producers like JBS and Tyson Foods have emissions footprints on a par with some of the world\u2019s fossil fuel companies. But unlike Shell and Exxon, meat companies, even fast-food giants like McDonald\u2019s, are far less seen as the corporate face of climate breakdown.\n\nThis absence of food in the climate space has been slowly shifting in recent years. Two years ago, at the COP28 Dubai climate summit, 159 governments signed a declaration on sustainable food and agriculture. Meanwhile some companies, particularly in the retail sector, are recognising that changing what they sell could help them meet corporate climate targets.\n\nA number of European supermarkets, including German giant Lidl, have made commitments to increase the share of plant proteins they sell, reducing products sourced from animals.\n\nPeak meat?\n\nFast food giant McDonald\u2019s, despite some forays into plant-based alternatives, is focusing its climate efforts on regenerative agriculture. This approach by itself, however, can\u2019t provide the levels of emissions reductions required to mitigate meat and dairy\u2019s climate impact, since even greater amounts of land would be needed for livestock farmed in this way. Greenhouse gas reductions achieved through regenerative practices would be cancelled out by higher levels of deforestation and other ecosystem destruction.\n\nMeanwhile, governments seem reluctant to take on food in their climate strategies, afraid of social backlash and accusations of meddling in people\u2019s food choices. However, we cannot keep ignoring this huge contributor to climate breakdown.\n\nLast year, a survey of scientists and experts by the Harvard Law School indicated that we should be reaching \u2018peak meat\u2019 as soon as this year. While many citizens and consumers may be resistant to shifting their diets away from meat, others are not.\n\nAccording to Madre Brava\u2019s own research, around half of consumers in Germany, France and the UK, and over a third in the US, are open to eating less meat, with many already adopting so-called flexitarian lifestyles. With more alternatives to meat readily available and improving in taste and affordability, it should be easier than ever to help consumers reduce the amount of animal-derived protein they consume.\n\nResearch suggests that shifting the food environment, i.e. making it easier to eat plant-rich foods, can begin to change behaviour. McDonald\u2019s rival, Burger King is selling plant-based Whoppers at a lower price than meat equivalents in Europe, leading to an increase in sales. One in five Whoppers sold in Germany is now plant-based.\n\nTipping the balance away from meat sales can have huge impacts in terms of emissions savings. If McDonald\u2019s replaced half its meat patties with veggie burgers (or half the meat in its burgers with other sources of protein), we calculate it would lead to the equivalent greenhouse gas savings of taking 12 million new gas-powered cars off EU roads.\n\nPolitical leadership\n\nAs with the energy transition, the transformation of our food system requires both efforts by the private sector and political leadership. Governments need to create ambitious food strategies to ensure systemic changes to how we produce and consume food, incorporating metrics for health and sustainability.\n\nThese should support food being brought into governments\u2019 Nationally Determined Contributions (concrete emissions reduction commitments under the Paris Climate agreement) and their net-zero plans.\n\nAs the embers of these latest fires fade and the political blame-game burns, it is essential that those who have shaped our food system for years recognise the urgent need to reduce its huge impact on our climate. The energy sector has shown that with private innovation, fairer market conditions and sound government policy, we can take huge strides towards reducing emissions. It is way past time the food sector made strides of its own.",

Courtesy McDonald\u2019s\n\nThe original Snack Wrap, which came with grilled or crispy chicken and ranch or honey mustard sauce, has been off McDonald\u2019s menus since 2016.\n\nAt the time, news of its discontinuation sent shockwaves through the internet.\n\nChicken Big Mac, McCrispy and chicken strips\n\nKempczinski also said the chain is planning to continue rolling out the Chicken Big Mac as a limited-time offering, noting that the over-the-top sandwich helped generate chicken market share growth in both France and the U.S.\n\nHe also said that the McCrispy, a fried crispy chicken sandwich featuring crinkle-cut pickles on a roll, is now in over 70 markets and will be available in nearly all markets by the end of the year. Plus, a new chicken strip offering will be launched across the country, though we don\u2019t yet know what what form it will take.\n\nFor years, McDonald\u2019s chicken strip offering was the fan-favorite Chicken Selects, but it was discontinued in 2015. The chain introduced Buttermilk Crispy Tenders in 2017, but removed it from menus in 2020.\n\nMcDonald's Chicken Big Mac. McDonald's\n\nBut the chain is remaining tight-lipped on the timing of these items: Representatives for McDonald\u2019s declined TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAnd when an analyst asked Kempczinski during the call when customers should expect the chicken strip\u2019s arrival or the Snack Wrap\u2019s relaunch, he didn\u2019t mince words.\n\n\u201cMy U.S. team would kill me if I gave any more details about the when and the exact specifics of how we\u2019re going to plan on doing that, but certainly expect that to come online later in the year,\u201d he said.\n\nSocial media is to thank for the return of the Snack Wrap\n\nBack on Dec. 5, Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald\u2019s USA, spoke to ABC News about the new McValue menu and confirmed the item\u2019s return, thrilling its extremely passionate group of fans.\n\n\u201cThe Snack Wrap will be back in 2025,\u201d Erlinger said. \u201cIt has a cult following, I get so many emails into my inbox about this product.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Erlinger declined to give a specific drop date \u201cfor competitive reasons.\u201d\n\nAccording to McDonald\u2019s senior marketing director Guillame Huin, we have social media to thank for its return.\n\n\u201cIf you ever wonder if your posts here matter, if they have an impact, if we even care, let me tell you something, you and you only with your countless posts and requests and petitions made it happen,\u201d Huin wrote on X. \u201cThey were in all our meetings, all our discussions, every single powerpoint to make a case for it. You won, snack wrap fans. Thank you.\u201d\n\nFor years, social media has led the charge to bring the Snack Wrap back. A Change.org petition started in 2021 garnered over 17,000 signatures, and multiple posts on X, Reddit, TikTok and beyond longed for the days of the Snack Wrap.\n\nHuin also said that Snack Wraps were \u201cBY FAR, our most requested items of all time.\u201d\n\nAs expected, people online wrapped the news around themselves like a warm flour tortilla.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s brin(g)ing the Snack Wrap back. I used to pray for times like this,\u201d posted one X user.\n\n\u201cI might actually cry,\u201d wrote another.\n\n\u201cBESTIES WAKE UP!!!! MCDONALDS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT SNACKWRAPS ARE BACK IN 2025!!!!!!!\u201d a TikTok user wrote while dancing in their car.\n\nPrior to McDonald\u2019s announcement, competitors tried their hand at achieving Snack Wrap-esque virality with the public, all with varying results.\n\nIn March 2023, Wendy\u2019s introduced a Grilled Chicken Ranch Wrap; in July 2023, Taco Bell brought back the Crispy Chicken Taco for a limited time (one X user said it tasted just like the Snack Wrap); and in August 2023, Burger King launched BK Royal Crispy Wraps for a limited time.",

            "content": "Every year I do a roundup of former Nevada basketball players who are now playing professional basketball, and that story is coming soon. But on the drive to work today, I thought, \"I wonder what Jordan Brown is up to these day?\" Almost all Wolf Pack hoops fans remember Jordan Brown, who in 2018 became just the second McDonald's All-American to sign with Nevada. Brown was a five-star recruit and the No. 16 national prospect by 247Sports.com, making him the highest-rated player to sign with Nevada, barely edging Luke Babbitt.\n\nThe Wolf Pack first offered Brown a scholarship on April 13, 2015 before signing him three years and one day later on May 14, 2018, beating finalists Cal and Arizona. Brown's career at Nevada lasted much shorter than the Wolf Pack's pursuit of him as the 6-foot-11, 235-pounder from Roseville, Calif., got limited minutes on the team's loaded 2018-19 team, averaging 3.0 points and 2.1 rebounds in 10.1 minutes per game while shooting 50.6 percent from the field as Nevada limited its rotation to around six players that season (two more were in the 10- to 12-minute range).\n\nThat limited playing time and Eric Musselman's departure to Arkansas after the season prompted Brown to transfer to Arizona despite new head coach Steve Alford, who had recruited the big man at UCLA, saying . After a mandatory redshirt season following the transfer \u2014 remember when that was a thing? \u2014 Brown was the Pac-12 sixth man of the year with the Wildcats in 2021. Then came a transfer to Louisiana where he played for two seasons (2021-23) and last year's tenure with Memphis, which included just 18 games as he missed almost all of December and January with .\n\nOverall, Brown played 137 college games, averaging 10.7 points and 5.5 rebounds while making 54.3 percent of his shots. His most success tenure came at Louisiana where he tallied 17.5 points and 8.6 rebounds on 54.8 percent shooting, earning one first-team and one second-team All-Sun Belt honor. He also was the 2023 Sun Belt Tournament MVP after helping the Ragin Cajuns qualify for the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThat brings us to his current home \u2014 the Czech Republic. After the end of last season, Brown signed and briefly played with a team in Croatia, appearing in two games. This season, he's playing for Basket Brno in the Czech National Basketball League. In 17 games, Brown is averaging 13.9 points and 7.1 rebounds per game, ranking second and first, respectively, on his team in those categories. Brown is shooting 62.1 percent from the field and making 62.2 percent of his free throws while ranking top 16 in the league in scoring, rebounding and two-point shooting. Basket Brno is 17-8, tied for second in the eight-team league as the team looks for its first league championship since 1996.\n\nThere were 24 McDonald's All-Americans in Brown's class in 2018, although that group didn't not produce a lot of future NBA stars, but Darius Garland and Zion Williamson could fit in that category. Of those 24 McDonald's All-Americans, 18 have played in the NBA, including Garland, Williamson, RJ Barrett, Moses Brown, Louis King, Romeo Langford, Immanuel Quickley, Naz Reid, Jalen Smith, Bol Bol, Coby White, Darius Bazley, Quentin Grimes, Devon Dotson, Keldon Johnson, Cam Reddish, Tre Jones, Nassir Little and Reggie Perry.\n\nThat leaves five 2018 McDonald's All-Americans who didn't make it to the NBA, including Brown; David McCormack (four years at Kansas); E.J. Montgomery (two years at Kentucky); Jahvon Quinerly (one year at Villanova, three years at Alabama and one year at Memphis); and Simisola Shittu (one year at Vanderbilt). We'll have an update on the rest of Nevada's pros later this month.",

Cornachio and her co-counsel Laura Murphy, who are being paid up to $300 an hour, with no cap, are financially motivated to continue prosecuting their client.\n\nHowever, Kim found that their allegations were not supported by evidence and denied the motion.\n\nOrange County District Attorney David Hoovler recused himself and his office from prosecuting the case in 2023.\n\nWhen Hoovler was a defense attorney in 2008, before being elected DA, he sought a plea deal for Andre Thurston, according to an internal state police report reviewed as part of a 2024 USA TODAY Network New York investigation. Police believe Thurston, who died in 2010, was in the car when McDonald was murdered.\n\nIn court Tuesday, the two sides also discussed at length the defense's plan to call a memory expert to explain some apparent discrepancies in Holley's alibi in interviews with police over the years since he was first considered a suspect.\n\nChild abuse: Shawangunk man will serve up to 10 years for 1,600 child sex abuse images\n\nKim said she would hold off on ruling on that until she hears a response from the defense to prosecutors' objections.\n\nKim also agreed to a defense motion to place some limits on the number of photos of McDonald's injuries that can be presented during the trial.\n\nAs for a defense motion to speak to each potential juror individually about how much media coverage of the case they have been exposed to, Kim said if there are more sensitive questions that need to be asked beyond the basic issue, she will allow those to be asked in a more private setting than the courtroom \u2014 or clear the courtroom of spectators for those questions.\n\n\"That is what we have done in the past,\" Kim said. \"This is not the first media case to be tried in Orange County, and it won't be the last.\"\n\nHolley's trial is scheduled to begin March 3 with jury selection.\n\nMike Randall covers breaking news for the Times Herald-Record and the Poughkeepsie Journal.

Almost exactly one year ago, Erlinger promised fans that the menu item would be back...at some point. However, he gave no real indication of the timeline and on what level it would return.

She used many different mediums: pastels, charcoal, sketching, pen and ink, and watercolors. Watercolors were probably her favorite. She belonged to the Pass Christian and Gulf Coast Art Associations.\n\nPhyllis was affectionately known as \u201cTootsie\u201d, \u201cToots\u201d, and \u201cAunt Tootsie\u201d.

Since Burgess was interim registrar, the plan had always been to recruit for a permanent person to fulfill it, according to county spokesperson Bethany Drysdale.\n\nMcDonald was selected among 41 candidates and recommended for appointment by County Manager Eric Brown.\n\nMcDonald previously served as the assistant registrar of voters for San Diego County and Clark County. He then became deputy registrar of voters for Washoe County in 2024 and filled in for Burgess during her leave, overseeing Washoe County's 2024 general election.\n\nCommissioners Jeanne Herman and Mike Clark voted against McDonald's appointment.\n\n\"I'm very concerned about this appointment,\" Herman said. \"I think our citizens deserve someone who is super qualified, and I'm afraid we're not doing our job if we don't look into this a little bit better and go back to the drawing board.\"\n\nAccording to HR representative Julie Paholke, one commissioner was invited to partake in the selection process, which was Herman. Herman told the board on Tuesday that McDonald was not her first choice then and now.\n\nClark voted no because he felt Burgess's leave was not settled yet, and he wanted a better selection team.\n\n\"I want somebody else to pick,\" Clark said. \"We've got to get somebody in here who knows how to pick somebody who can stay and do the task.\"\n\nAssistant District Attorney Nate Edwards said the county could not comment on the Burgess leave, as there was ongoing litigation and a personnel investigation. However, Edwards said he's never seen an interim remain if a different person is chosen by the board to fill the position permanently.\n\nWhy have there been so many registrars?\n\nMcDonald is the fourth registrar in Washoe County in the past four years.\n\nThe line of registrars who left the county started when Deanna Spikula resigned before the 2022 election, citing threats, harassment and stress. Jamie Rodriguez took over as interim registrar before the 2022 election, and was appointed to the permanent position in December 2022.\n\nRodriguez submitted her letter of resignation in January 2024, becoming part of a wave of top election officials calling it quits in Nevada counties. Burgess then took over as the interim registrar in January 2024, after acting as the deputy registrar since September 2023.\n\nMonths later, Burgess claimed the county forced her to leave in September, according to the Associated Press. McDonald filled in for her role through the general election.\n\nJaedyn Young covers local government for the Reno Gazette-Journal.

            "content": "CAMPBELL \u2014 The Campbell Memorial boys basketball team finished their first season in the Mahoning Valley Athletic Conference Scarlet tier about as well as possible.\n\nThe Red Devils clinched the outright league title Tuesday in Campbell with a come-from-behind 59-54 victory vs. McDonald.\n\nThe meeting of the Devils began to tip in favor of McDonald, which led by 11 points at halftime, but a quick start to the third quarter by Campbell and a rough time shooting in the second half allowed the Red Devils to edge out the Blue Devils and secure the conference championship on their home court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s special,\u201d Campbell coach Nick Canterino said of winning the league title. \u201cIt being the first year in this new tier, we wanted to come out and kind of set the tone for it. We definitely thought that was one of our goals, to win the league. We had the one blunder in the league, but finishing strong here.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s meeting was a tale of two halves, as McDonald wrangled control of the game away from Campbell early on. The Blue Devils took a 23-19 lead into the second quarter, which proved even more in favor of the road team.\n\nAfter weathering a hot start to the quarter by Campbell, McDonald scored eight unanswered points and finished the half on a 9-3 run to take an 42-31 advantage into the break.\n\nFrom there, Campbell took control.\n\nThe Red Devils scored 12 of the first 15 points in the third quarter, and despite a couple of 3-pointers by McDonald, Campbell held the Blue Devils to just seven points in the third.\n\n\u201cThey hit some shots, and they sped us up, they really did,\u201d McDonald coach James Franceschelli said. \u201cWe were just talking about it; they sped us up, but we needed to, once we got it across halfcourt, we needed to slow back down. And we never really got into that position. I don\u2019t think we could have played a better first half, and I don\u2019t think we could have played a worse second half.\u201d\n\nThe fourth, which Campbell entered trailing by two points, proved to be even worse for the McDonald offense. The Blue Devils could only muster five points in the final period, but despite their woes, they still had a chance to escape Campbell with a win in the final minute of the game.\n\nAfter a Drew Zajack field goal halfway into the fourth, pulling McDonald back within two points, both teams went more than three minutes without scoring.\n\nThe Blue Devils had the ball with under 45 seconds to play, but a Chris Ragazzine triple missed the mark, and Campbell\u2019s Josue \u201cSway\u201d Rodriguez subsequently put the Red Devils ahead by two possessions at the free-throw line.\n\nAny chance at a McDonald comeback ultimately came to an end moments later when another 3-point attempt clanged off of the rim and Campbell made an additional free throw at the other end.\n\nJared Colon led all scorers with 22 points Tuesday, while Zajack scored a McDonald-best 14.\n\n\u201cSuch a bad defensive first half for us. And as bad as that first half was defensively, it was that much better defensively in the second half,\u201d Canterino said. \u201cThese guys really just stepped it up and buckled down and defended.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s win ensures Campbell, which entered the game with a one-game lead on McDonald in the MVAC Scarlet standings, will finish at least one game ahead of McDonald regardless of the results of the teams\u2019 final league games.\n\nMcDonald (15-6, 12-3) will try to rebound from the loss \u2014 its first since a Jan. 9 defeat vs. Campbell \u2014 against Lowellville in its regular-season finale. The Blue Devils will host the Rockets on Friday before shifting focus to a home playoff matchup with Mapleton next Friday.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate goal was to win a district championship, so we got to get back to work tomorrow and prepare for that,\u201d Franceschelli said.\n\nCampbell (17-4, 14-1) finishes its season at Sebring on Friday. The Red Devils host Southern next Friday in their postseason opener.",

            "content": "Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nMichael McDonald (born February 12, 1952, St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.) is an American singer-songwriter best known as the lead vocalist and keyboardist for the rock band the Doobie Brothers. McDonald became a fixture on rock radio with his rich and soulful vocals. He followed up his successful stint with the Doobie Brothers with a durable solo career, producing hits as a solo artist, in duets, and on film soundtracks.\n\nRaised in Ferguson , Missouri , McDonald grew up listening to Broadway show tunes, rhythm and blues (R&B), and the music of the British Invasion . He formed his first band, Mike and the Majestics, while he was in high school and later developed his singing and keyboard skills while working in St. Louis nightclubs. In a 2018 interview with the Austin American-Statesman newspaper , he recalled how hearing the R&B song \u201cStop Her on Sight (S.O.S.)\u201d by Edwin Starr changed his life: \u201cThe song really got me. Hearing that record pumping out over this great stereo system.\u2026I just had this thought that someday I\u2019d like to make a record like that\u2014a song with a sophisticated arrangement. So I kinda chased that from that moment on.\u201d\n\nCareer\n\nThe Doobie Brothers Members of the Doobie Brothers at a photo session for their 1978 album Minute by Minute: (clockwise from bottom left) Jeff Baxter, John Hartman, Patrick Simmons, Keith Knudsen, Tiran Porter, and Michael McDonald (center). (more)\n\nIn 1970 McDonald moved to Los Angeles, where he recorded a handful of unsuccessful demos and singles before joining the rock group Steely Dan as a session backup vocalist and keyboardist in 1973. He became a member of Steely Dan\u2019s touring band in 1974 and contributed backing vocals to songs such as \u201cBad Sneakers\u201d and \u201cBlack Friday\u201d from the group\u2019s 1975 album Katy Lied. Although he would eventually join the Doobie Brothers, he maintained a close professional relationship with the members of Steely Dan and added backing vocals to tracks on the group\u2019s The Royal Scam (1976), Aja (1977), and Gaucho (1980) and perhaps most memorably on the band\u2019s 1977 hit single \u201cPeg.\u201d\n\nBritannica Quiz Pop Culture Quiz\n\nIn 1975 Jeff Baxter, a guitarist for the Doobie Brothers, recommended that McDonald temporarily replace the band\u2019s lead singer, Tom Johnston, who was ill at the time, on tour. The band was so impressed with McDonald\u2019s musicianship that it invited him to become a full-time member. In the book Long Train Runnin\u2019: Our Story of the Doobie Brothers (2022), bass guitarist Tiran Porter recalled, \u201cThe second I heard him open up his mouth\u2026my mind was blown right there.\u201d McDonald\u2019s husky vocals and gospel-inflected keyboard style transformed the band\u2019s feel-good rock and roll sound into a smooth, soulful R&B approach. As their lead vocalist, McDonald cowrote and performed on hit singles such as \u201cTakin\u2019 It to the Streets\u201d (1976), \u201cIt Keeps You Runnin\u2019 \u201d (1976), the multiple Grammy Award-winning \u201cWhat a Fool Believes\u201d (1979), \u201cMinute by Minute\u201d (1979), and \u201cReal Love\u201d (1980).\n\nOver the years McDonald collaborated with other popular vocalists. He recorded the duet \u201cLet Me Go, Love\u201d (1978) with Nicolette Larson and contributed backing vocals to the hit song \u201cRide Like the Wind\u201d (1979) by Christopher Cross. McDonald also appeared on numerous albums by performers that included Carly Simon, Bonnie Raitt, Elton John, Rickie Lee Jones, Kenny Loggins (with whom he wrote \u201cWhat a Fool Believes\u201d), Joni Mitchell, and the Pointer Sisters.\n\nThe Doobie Brothers disbanded in 1982, in large part because of McDonald\u2019s increasing focus on his solo career. His debut album, If That\u2019s What It Takes (1982), features the jazzy hit single \u201cI Keep Forgettin\u2019 (Every Time You\u2019re Near).\u201d His second solo release, That Was Then: The Early Recordings of Michael McDonald (1982), is a collection of his early singles. His next release, No Lookin\u2019 Back (1985), has a harder rock sound and spawned a minor hit with the title track. While developing his solo career McDonald continued collaborating with other artists. His duets with Patti LaBelle on \u201cOn My Own\u201d (1986) and James Ingram on \u201cYah Mo B There\u201d (1983) reached number one and number 19, respectively, on the U.S. charts. McDonald\u2019s solo recording of \u201cSweet Freedom,\u201d the theme song from the action comedy film Running Scared (1986), reached number seven on the U.S. charts.\n\nMcDonald combined rock and soul music on his 1990 album Take It to Heart. In 1991 he was featured on Aretha Franklin\u2019s single \u201cEver Changing Times,\u201d which was cowritten by Burt Bacharach. That same year, McDonald reunited with former Steely Dan bandmates Donald Fagen and Walter Becker to record and tour with the New York Rock and Soul Revue, a musical collective that also included Phoebe Snow and Boz Scaggs. For his album Blink of an Eye (1993), which features a soulful remake of the 1963 Freddie Scott hit \u201cHey, Girl,\u201d McDonald enlisted guest supporting musicians, including country singer Vince Gill and bluegrass singer Alison Krauss.\n\nGet Unlimited Access Try Britannica Premium for free and discover more.

He released the album Blue Obsession in 1997, which features the original song \u201cAll I Need\u201d and his rendition of Marvin Gaye\u2019s Motown classic \u201cAin\u2019t That Peculiar\u201d (which was cowritten by Smokey Robinson). He went on to release the tribute albums Motown (2003), Motown Two (2004), Soul Speak (2008), and Tribute to Motown Live (2009). In 2017 he released the album Wide Open, his first recording featuring original material since Blue Obsession.",

While fans were skeptical about the initial 2023 announcement that Snack Wraps were returning, the time has finally come\u2014yes, actually. McDonald\u2019s shared the news its 2024 Q4 Earnings Call.\n\nWith chicken sales soaring, in part thanks to the popular McCrispy, Mickey D\u2019s is leaning into its poultry menu.\n\n\u201cWe're excited about the significant opportunity we see within our chicken portfolio and see the potential to add another point of chicken market share by the end of 2026,\u201d McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said in the earnings call.\n\nThe biggest push in chicken will come from the returning Snack Wraps, which were discontinued in 2016 and featured a breaded chicken tender, lettuce, cheese, and special sauce in a snack-sized soft-shell tortilla.\n\n\u201cThis year, there is incredible energy for the return of Snack Wraps in the U.S.,\u201d Kempczinski said.\n\nHowever, while most Americans are excited about the wraps returning after years of petitioning, I\u2019m excited about what that means for another menu item: the discontinued Chicken Selects.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s crispy Chicken Selects were the fast food chain\u2019s take on chicken tenders\u2014and also the chicken offered in the classic Snack Wrap. They were discontinued in the United States in 2013, but have been available in the U.K. ever since.\n\nNow, McDonald\u2019s is bringing my favorite menu item back\u2014well, sort of.\n\nBloomberg/Contributor/Getty Images\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Is Bringing Back Chicken Strips This Year\n\nKempczinski stated in the earnings call that Mickey D\u2019s will \u201claunch a new chicken strip offering\u201d this year, likely timed with the return of the Snack Wrap.\n\nCalling it a \u201cchicken strip offering\u201d rather than Chicken Selects by name does make me skeptical\u2014it\u2019s unclear if they\u2019ll be the same recipe as the early \u201800s. According to everything we know so far, the Snack Wrap will still called a Snack Wrap, after all. However, as long as a chicken tender is back at McDonald\u2019s, all will be right in my world.\n\nWhen Mickey D\u2019s originally announced that Snack Wraps were returning, it was to coincide with its new McCrispy sandwich launch, which joined menus as a \u201cSouthern-style fried chicken sandwich\u201d alongside the classic McChicken. So, will the new chicken strips follow the McCrispy recipe? That information isn\u2019t available just yet, but you can bet that I\u2019ll be keeping my ears open for when it is.\n\nIn addition to the returning Snack Wraps and chicken strips, McDonald\u2019s announced that the Chicken Big Mac will return as a limited-time offering throughout the year as well.\n\nBetween the Snack Wraps, chicken strips, and Chicken Big Mac returning, Mickey D\u2019s is going all in on chicken this year. But, don\u2019t think we forgot about that 14-ounce Big Arch burger that\u2019s supposed to be coming stateside soon\u2014because I certainly did not.",

It\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we make sure that we have a strong value program,\u201d Kempczinski said.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s U.S. sales slowed in the first half of 2024 as customers grew tired of price increases. The company responded in June with a $5 value meal that reignited traffic. The deal was so successful that the company extended it through next summer.\n\nBut then an E. coli outbreak, which was first reported Oct. 22, sickened at least 104 people in 14 states, including 34 who were hospitalized, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One person in Colorado died.\n\nThe FDA closed its investigation into the outbreak in December, saying McDonald\u2019s contained it once it stopped serving the raw onions the virus was linked to. But Kempczinski said the outbreak hurt sales of the Quarter Pounder, which is usually a big profit-generator.\n\nSales also remain weaker in the Rocky Mountain states where the outbreak was centered, Kempczinski said. McDonald\u2019s doesn\u2019t expect them to recover until the beginning of the second quarter.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said it is working to get customer traffic back up in the U.S. and will then layer in new products that will generate excitement and increased spending. The snack wrap, a menu item that has generated a lot of excitement, will return sometime this year, and McDonald\u2019s is also planning a new chicken strip offering, Kempczinski said.\n\nKempczinski said the company is also learning a lot about demand for beverages like energy drinks from the beverage-focused CosMc\u2019s chain it has been testing since early last year. Kempczinski said the company is trying to figure out how it can capture that demand within its existing restaurants.\n\nInternational sales in McDonald\u2019s company-operated markets edged upward slightly in the fourth quarter, with particularly strong sales in Germany and Italy. But Kempczinski said McDonald\u2019s is also struggling to draw lower-income consumers in the U.K.\n\nThe bright spot for the fourth quarter was McDonald\u2019s licensed markets overseas, where same-store sales climbed 4.1%. McDonald\u2019s said it saw strong sales growth in the Middle East, where sales have struggled in recent years, and Japan.\n\nOverall, McDonald\u2019s global same-store sales rose less than 1% for the fourth quarter. That was better than the 1.1% decline Wall Street had forecast, according to analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nFourth-quarter revenue fell slightly to $6.38 billion, just short of the $6.45 billion analysts were expecting.\n\nThe company\u2019s fourth-quarter net income also fell, 1% to $2.01 billion. Adjusted for one-time items, McDonald\u2019s earned $2.83 per share, which was lower than the $2.85 per share than Wall Street anticipated.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s shares rose more than 4% in early trading Monday.",

The fast-food giant's share price was up 4.5% as of noon ET, amid the backdrop of a 0.5% gain for the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.90%) and a 1.1% gain for the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 2.39%).\n\nMcDonald's reported its fourth-quarter results before the market opened this morning, and sales and earnings performance for the period actually came in below expectations. But despite missing Wall Street's top-line and bottom-line targets, the business showed signs of improvement in key areas -- and management outlined strategies that have investors feeling bullish.\n\nMcDonald's stock gains despite Q4 misses\n\nIn last year's fourth quarter, McDonald's posted non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) adjusted earnings per share of $2.83 on sales of $6.39 billion. For comparison, the average analyst estimate had called for the business to post adjusted earnings per share of $2.86 on revenue of $6.48 billion. Overall revenue was down 0.3% year over year in the period, and adjusted earnings per share were down 4%.\n\nDespite the sales decline, investors are finding some bright spots in the revenue composition. While same-store sales in the U.S. declined 1.4% compared to the prior-year period due to a decline in spending per check, sales for the international operated markets segment actually increased 0.1% -- coming in far better than the roughly 1.1% decline forecasted by Wall Street. Meanwhile, revenue for the international developmental licensed markets segment increased 4.1% year over year -- far better than the roughly 0.4% decline called for by the average Wall Street estimate.\n\nWhat's next for McDonald's?\n\nWhile McDonald's has seen some persistent challenges related to an E. coli outbreak last year, management expects that these issues will be in the rearview mirror by the second quarter. As a result, profitability is expected to see a significant improvement.\n\nMcDonald's says that it will continue to focus on building out its digital ordering platform and prioritizing value-oriented menu offerings. On the other hand, the company says that it's already seeing improvements for average check amounts and customer traffic in the U.S. and other markets.\n\nThe company anticipates that the impact of menu and digital ordering initiatives and improving trends for check size and customer traffic will deliver results improvements that really start to show up in the second quarter. With McDonald's stock up just 6% over the last year despite a 21% rally for the S&P 500 index, the company's share price could have room to run if trends shape up in line with management's expectations.",

US comparable sales fell by 1.4% in the quarter, marking the largest sales decline in the country in almost half a decade.\n\nThe US sales slip was steeper than analysts were expecting, and was impacted by an E. coli outbreak in October that saw the chain briefly halt selling its iconic Quarter Pounders in roughly a fifth of its US restaurants. Even a push for its much-vaunted $5 value menu, the continued success of its loyalty scheme (sales to members of its Rewards scheme were up 30% in 2024), and a rerelease of the company\u2019s ace, the McRib sandwich, did little to pork up the company\u2019s stateside sales. Indeed, while McDonald\u2019s and America are often culturally synonymous, the chain has been having a tough time in its biggest global market recently.\n\nChain reaction\n\nLuckily, McDonald\u2019s sales are still booming abroad, with plans for international expansion forging ahead\u2026 potentially why the company\u2019s stock is up 5% in early trading this morning despite US sales stalling.\n\nIndeed, the majority of the company\u2019s new restaurants are set to be opened outside of the US in the years ahead. On the earnings call, Ian Borden, the company\u2019s Global Chief Financial Officer, said:\n\n\u201cGlobally, we plan to open approximately 2,200 restaurants this year, with about 1/4 of these openings in our US and IOM segments. We expect to open more than 1,600 restaurants in our IDL segment, including about 1,000 in China. Overall, we anticipate slightly over 4% unit growth from the nearly 1,800 net restaurant additions in 2025.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a continuation of the strategy of the last few years, which has seen the company trim its US store portfolio \u2014 actually shutting ~900 branches nationwide from 2015 to 2021 \u2014 while expanding overseas. Indeed, the company says it\u2019s \u201con track to reach 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027,\u201d which would mark its fastest ever period of global expansion.",

In 2025, the chain aims to regain foot traffic with its McValue menu platform and new offerings from chicken strips to the return of snack wraps.\n\nInternational-owned stores saw positive same-store sales growth in the Middle East, which CFO Ian Borden attributed to the lapse of the impact of the Israeli conflict, plus growth in Japan and \"encouraging signs of stabilization\" in China.\n\nGlobal same-store sales for the quarter, which ended Dec. 31, grew 0.4% compared to an expected decline of 0.91%.\n\nCEO Chris Kempczinski told investors that the company is moving with \"urgency\" as it looks to increase guest count, win market share, and reclaim \"leadership in value and affordability.\"\n\nGlobal same-store sales for the quarter ended Dec. 31 were up 0.4%, compared with an expected decline of 0.91%. But US same-store sales were down 1.4% year over year, as an E. coli outbreak offset momentum in late October. The burger chain alluded to a decline in check growth, offset by slightly higher guests count.\n\nRevenue at the fast food giant for the fourth quarter decreased 0.28% from a year ago to $6.39 billion, missing expectations for $6.45 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 were also lower than Wall Street's estimate of $2.84.\n\nMcDonald's ( MCD ) results missed the mark to end 2024 as the fast food chain faced an underperforming stock, lackluster sales, and an E. coli outbreak .\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"It sounds like January was not a good month across the board, mostly driven by really poor weather in every region \u2014 snow, extreme cold,\" BTIG analyst Peter Saleh told Yahoo Finance prior to earnings. The conditions make it difficult to assess whether the value menu drove incremental foot traffic.\n\nAhead of the earnings report, TD Cowen's Andrew Charles said he'd be looking for company-operated stores' margins and any impact from the value offerings.\n\nNet income fell 1% to $2.02 billion during the quarter and was down 3% for the year to $8.22 billion.\n\nFranchise operators had hoped that the McValue platform would lure in customers, offsetting any hit to margins.\n\n\"There may be a margin challenge where we are providing food at a great value, but if we can bring more people in, then it will take care of that. That's our goal,\" David Costa, a McDonald's franchise operator who operates 18 locations in Florida with his father, told Yahoo Finance prior to the McValue launch in January.\n\nBorden said parts of the platform, such as buy one, add one for $1, led to \"good margins\" and allowed the customers flexibility in building their meal. He added that breakfast continues to be a strong performer and hinted at innovation to come.\n\n2025 is expected to be a year of value and affordability for McDonald's. It's looking to win back low-income consumers and lure customers in with menu innovation.\n\n\"With good value at the foundation, we will overlay a strong pipeline of creative marketing ideas that will delight our fans and will provide full margin check growth,\" Borden said.\n\nThat includes building on its chicken portfolio with \"the potential to add another point of chicken market share by the end of 2026.\"\n\nAnalysts say the company's efforts will show up in results for the second half of the year.\n\n\"The comparisons get so easy in the second half that even if they fumble through the first half ...[McDonald's is] still going to have [a] positive, constant recovery story in the second half,\" Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan, who has an Outperform rating on the stock, told Yahoo Finance on the phone.\n\nSaleh, who has a Neutral rating, said franchisees are worried about the overdependence on promotions.\n\nIn January, the buy one, get one offering made up a mid-teens percentage of sales, and the $5 Meal Deal accounted for low-double digits. Franchisees also offered in-app promotions, according to Saleh's note to clients.\n\n\"When 35% of your business is now on steep discount or free, [it's] hard to really make a lot of money on that,\" Saleh said. \"[It's] going to be tough to wean the consumer off of that and bring them back to kind of more profitable type products.\"\n\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The rough quarter only compounded with the rest of a tough 2024, with McDonald\u2019s value perception slipping among its cash-conscious customers, many of whom ended up eating elsewhere.\n\n\u201cOur performance in 2024 did not meet our expectations,\u201d CEO Chris Kempczinski said on a call with analysts Monday. \u201cIt was a big year, and at times it felt like McDonald\u2019s was part of almost every major news story, reflecting the reach and visibility of our brand.\u201d\n\nThe earnings report Monday gives investors a peek at how detrimental the E. coli outbreak was, which sickened more than 100 people across a dozen states and resulted in several lawsuits against the chain. Fresh slivered onions served on the Quarter Pounders were the likely source of the bacteria, and the Centers for Disease Control declared the outbreak over in November.\n\nSales bottomed out in November and improved in the following months; however, the company doesn\u2019t expect its business to recover fully until the beginning the second quarter in 2025.\n\nIn an attempt to bring customers back, McDonald\u2019s spent $100 million on marketing efforts during the quarter. It also announced a new value menu, which launched in January, to turn sales around.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s hopes the new \u201cMcValue\u201d menu category reignites growth after several dismal quarters dragged down by perceptions about its pricing. The average price of its menu items has soared about 40% since 2019, but the company says that is in line with its rising costs.\n\nSo far, the chain is \u201cpleased\u201d with the results of the new menu, and mornings are a bright spot for its performance. McDonald\u2019s has been serving breakfast in the US for 50 years as of this year, Kempczinski said, adding that the chain has gained market share for breakfast lately.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, McDonald\u2019s will open about 2,200 new restaurants globally this year \u2014 with a quarter of them in \u201cmature markets,\u201d including the US. The chain will also continue growing its chicken selection, including the addition of new chicken tenders, the return of the Snack Wrap and bringing back the Chicken Big Mac for limited time offers.\n\nWhile McDonald\u2019s is still struggling in the United States, quarterly sales rose 4.1% at its international development licensed markets \u2014 particularly in the Middle East, where the American brand had been the target of boycotts and backlash.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) stock rose nearly 4% in early trading.",

Loyalty drives more visits and those customers spend more over time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccelerating the Arches continues to be the right strategy as we focus on growing market share,\u201d Kempczinski said in a press release. \u201cWe\u2019re playing to win, focusing on our customers with outstanding value, exciting menu innovation and culturally relevant marketing.\u201d\n\nLaunching the McValue Menu\n\nPart of that innovation was the Jan. 7 launch of its new McValue menu nationwide, offering customers all-day savings and a variety of deals, including the Buy One, Add One for $1 offer and the popular $5 Meal Deal. The platform also includes app-exclusive perks like free medium fries with a $1 purchase every Friday in 2025 and a free McCrispy chicken sandwich for new app users.\n\nAs McDonald\u2019s marks its 70th anniversary this year, Kempczinski stressed the company\u2019s commitment to treating communities with dignity and respect, building on the legacy of founder Ray Kroc, and ensuring the company\u2019s readiness for growth.\n\n\u201cThe E. coli impact is now localized to areas that had the biggest impacts,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich was mainly the Rocky Mountains. It\u2019s been contained to that region. The rest of the U.S. didn\u2019t see an impact. It\u2019s going to be a function of us executing. Weve got to make sure McValue is off to good start and strong marketing programs with that. When we do that and do that well, we can put up positive guest counts and positive comps.\u201d\n\nImportance of Restaurant Loyalty Programs\n\nAs McDonald\u2019s introduces its new value offerings to attract more customers, the importance of loyalty programs in the restaurant industry cannot be overlooked. The PYMNTS Intelligence report, \u201cConnected Dining: Consumers Like the Taste of Discount Meals,\u201d shows 51% of consumers use at least one restaurant loyalty program, with 49% participating in these programs at quick-service restaurants (QSRs) and 34% at full-service restaurants (FSRs).\n\nMcDonald\u2019s focus on loyalty programs plays a crucial role in driving customer engagement. The company is leveraging geofencing technology as part of its \u201cReady on Arrival\u201d program to streamline the mobile ordering process, allowing crews to prepare orders before customers even arrive at the restaurant. This initiative is elevating customer satisfaction by reducing wait times and improving kitchen efficiency. By integrating technologies like geofencing and enhancing its mobile app experience, McDonald\u2019s aims to streamline service and reinforce its loyalty proposition.",

            "content": "Mary Elizabeth Steele, passed away peacefully in her home in Sandown, NH on Sunday morning February 9 with her wife Alison, and her sister in law Ellen, by her side. She had many visits with family and friends during her end of life. She was 72 years old.\n\nMary was born on May 26, 1952 in Cambridge, MA. She grew up in Reading MA and attended St Agnes Elementary School and Reading Memorial High School. She was predeceased by her parents Robert Steele and Catherine (Reardon) Steele. She was one of six children.\n\nMary traveled after high school, driving cross country to California where she lived for several years before returning to her home state\n\nMary completed a 720 hour course at the Wentworth Institute for electromechanical technology in the 80\u2019s. Displaying that type of aptitude, she was encouraged to take the postal exam by her Uncle Jim and that eventually led Mary to the United States Postal Service. Mary found employment as an Electronic technician, the first female ET in the Northeast Area. She remained there for over 25 years before retiring.\n\nMary\u2019s job was to maintain the extensive mail sorting equipment at the Middlesex-Essex Postal Facility, first in Woburn, then North Reading. This is where she met her future wife Alison Hartung when they began to work the same day shift. Alison was quite smitten and it took a lot of time and patience but perseverance eventually won out! They began officially seeing each other in 1999, Alison moved to Sandown in 2000 where they remained, legally marrying in NH when it became available to them.\n\nAs a couple they were yin and yang, Mary\u2019s cup was half empty, Alison\u2019s half full but they were suited to one another with Mary teaching Alison how to finally be an adult and Alison getting Mary gently out of her comfort zone on occasion. After enduring many of Alison\u2019s over the top antics, Mary became the master of the \u2018eyeroll\u2019. She had a quick wit and a dry sense of humor which she did not spare when it came to her wife.\n\nThey tried to plan a \u2018big trip\u2019 every year or two. 8 trips to Key West, one of which allowed them to be a tour guide for Mary\u2019s sister Judy. A four-day houseboat trip with many of Mary\u2019s family on the Cumberland river in Tennessee. Trips to Vieques PR, Virgin Gorda, Beautiful Fall Creek Falls Tennessee for her niece Mattie\u2019s wedding celebration, honeymoon in Scotland, many trips to Chatham and Martha\u2019s Vineyard, and a trip to the grand circle of parks in Utah; Bryce, Zion, Grand Canyon and Best Friends Animal Sanctuary where they took the tour and then volunteered in Dogtown for a day. This was an organization that Mary supported for 20 years.\n\nAs they got older, they were content to stay closer to home and enjoy their simple lives. Their multitude of dogs and cats over the years brought them great joys and in later years, great comfort. The last few years were difficult for Mary as she endured several overlapping health issues, but always showed great resilience, bouncing back over and over again. We knew she would eventually run out of steam, and she did, but on her terms. She was still very much her own person and she made her final decisions with her wife\u2019s blessings.\n\nMary is survived by her wife Alison who is proud to have finally been Mary\u2019s choice. She is also survived by her sisters Susan Steele of Jamaica Plain, Catherine Steele and Dave McMurray of Hartsville TN, Judy Meelia of Jamaica Plain, Nancy Paulding and Bob Paulding of West Yarmouth . Mary was predeceased by her brother Robert. Mary is also survived by many nieces and nephews. Gabriel, his wife Alex, children Kali and Sky; Mattie, husband Martin and children Lila and Claire; Chris and children Brinly, Cam, and Brielle; Kerri, her partner Manuel and children Ela and Nayu; Kaitlin, wife Jeanine and children Orin and Juno; Ben; Brian, wife Cayla. She was also survived by many friends, especially Beth Childs and Mary Chinetti who have been an immense unwavering support for both Mary and Alison, and they continue to be. And we have a great deal of gratitude for Tammy and Jeff and the rest of our wonderful neighbors who all have \u2018been on call\u2019.\n\nLast but not least, Mary is survived by her devoted little dog Emmy who made Mary \u2018her person\u2019 from the first time she was put on Mary\u2019s lap and that\u2019s where you could find her most days. She kept vigil at Mary\u2019s side throughout the end and stayed with her until Mary was taken for her final arrangements.\n\nMary will be missed, she will be mourned, she will be celebrated, but most of all she will be remembered and loved unconditionally.\n\nVisitation will be at McDonald Funeral Home, 19 Yale Ave., Wakefield, MA on Monday Feb 17 from 2-5PM. Guests are encouraged to wear brightly colored clothes, especially purple. Interment will be private at a later time.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Mary\u2019s name can be made to your local SPCA or animal shelters, Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Utah, www.bestfriends.org, The Alzheimer\u2019s association at act.alz.org, National Mental Health Alliance at www.nami.org or simply be kind to one another.",

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nHere's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $2.83 adjusted, meeting expectations\n\n$2.83 adjusted, meeting expectations Revenue: $6.39 billion vs. $6.44 billion expected\n\nNet sales of $6.39 billion were roughly flat compared with the year-ago period. The company's overall same-store sales growth of 0.4% outperformed Wall Street's expectations of same-store sales declines of 1%, according to StreetAccount estimates.\n\nBut McDonald's U.S. business reported a steeper-than-expected drop in its same-store sales. Same-store sales at the company's domestic restaurants fell 1.4% in the quarter; Wall Street was projecting same-store sales declines of 0.6%.\n\nMcDonald's said traffic was slightly positive, but customers spent less than usual during the quarter. Over the summer, the chain rolled out a $5 combo meal to bring back price-conscious diners and reverse sluggish sales. The strategy worked, helping McDonald's U.S. same-store sales tick up in the third quarter.\n\nHowever, analysts have warned that value meals only work if customers also add menu items that aren't discounted to their orders. McDonald's executives downplayed those concerns Monday, saying the average check on the $5 meal deal is more than $10.\n\nThe biggest hit to McDonald's U.S. sales came in late October, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked a fatal E. coli outbreak to its Quarter Pounder burgers. McDonald's switched suppliers for its slivered onions, the ingredient fingered as the likely culprit for the outbreak. In early December, the CDC declared the outbreak officially over.\n\nHowever, in the days following the news of the outbreak, traffic at McDonald's U.S. restaurants fell steeply, particularly in the states affected.\n\nU.S. sales hit their nadir in early November, but began rising again after that. In particular, demand for the Quarter Pounder, a popular core menu item with high margins, fell quickly in the wake of the crisis.\n\nMcDonald's expects its U.S. sales to recover by the beginning of the second quarter, executives said.\n\n\"I think right now what we're seeing is that the E. coli impact is now just localized to the areas that had the biggest impact,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's conference call. \"So think about that as sort of the Rocky Mountain region that was really the epicenter of the issue.\"\n\nThe company hopes value deals, along with key menu additions, will help to fuel the recovery this year. In 2025, the burger chain plans to bring back its popular snack wraps, which vanished from menus during pandemic lockdowns, and to introduce a new chicken strip menu item.\n\nOutside the U.S., sales were stronger. Both of McDonald's international divisions reported same-store sales increases, bolstering the company's overall performance.\n\nThe company's international developmental licensed markets segment, which includes the Middle East and Japan, reported same-store sales growth of 4.1%.\n\nMcDonald's international operated markets division, which includes some of its biggest markets, reported same-store sales growth of 0.1%. The company said most markets reported same-store sales increases, but the United Kingdom and some other markets saw same-store sales shrink in the quarter. One bright spot was France, which saw its same-store sales turn positive during the quarter after months of weak demand.\n\nMcDonald's reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.02 billion, or $2.80 per share, down from $2.04 billion, or $2.80 per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding gains tied to the sale of its South Korean business, transaction costs for buying its Israeli franchise and other items, McDonald's earned $2.83 per share.\n\nLooking to 2025, the first quarter is expected to be the low point for McDonald's same-store sales, CFO Ian Borden said, citing a weak start to the year in the U.S., among other factors. Winter storms and wildfires in California weighed on restaurant traffic across the industry in January.\n\nFor the full year, McDonald's plans to open roughly 2,200 restaurants. About a quarter of those locations will be in the U.S. and its international operated markets. The rest will be in the company's international developmental licensed markets, including about 1,000 new restaurants in China.\n\nIncluding its investments in restaurant openings, McDonald's plans to spend between $3 billion and $3.2 billion this year on capital expenditures.\n\nThe company is also projecting a headwind of 20 cents to 30 cents per share to its full-year earnings due to foreign currency exchange rates.",

Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $2.86 per share.\n\nMcDonald's Total Revenue\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. McDonald's has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates twice over the last two years.\n\nLooking at McDonald\u2019s peers in the traditional fast food segment, some have already reported their Q4 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Starbucks posted flat year-on-year revenue, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 0.9%, and Yum China reported revenues up 4.1%, falling short of estimates by 1.7%. Starbucks traded up 8.2% following the results while Yum China was also up 6.4%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Starbucks\u2019s results here and Yum China\u2019s results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the traditional fast food segment, with share prices up 11.1% on average over the last month. McDonald's is up 3.7% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $320.75 (compared to the current share price of $294.25).\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right.

It prompted questions on whether the training partnership has ended.\n\n\"After a lifetime of living on the road, competing and coaching, Debbie has decided to slow down and spend more time with her family in Idaho,\" Adrienne told Eurodressage. \"She will always be part of my life and I plan to continue to work with her in some capacity, either in person or virtually, for a long time to come.\"\n\nUnder Debbie's Wings\n\nLyle began as an assistant rider for Debbie McDonald at Parry and Peggy Thomas' River Grove Farm in Idaho and worked her way up. Her career launching horse was Wizard which took her to the 2012 Olympics in London.\n\nMcDonald discovered Harmony's Duval in 2013 and had Lyle train him up to Grand Prix level. After Wizard's retirement a syndicate led by Akiko Yamazaki secured Salvino as a successor for Lyle in 2015. The stallion was later on secured by Betsy Juliano who supported Adrienne's career on this and other horses (Horizon) with Debbie McDonald as a constant by her side.\n\nMcDonald was instrumental in Lyle's rise to the top on Salvino and at that time also took over the training of riders Kasey Perry and Laura Graves, who all thrived under Debbie's tutelage and brought team U.S.A to unprecedented heights.\n\nU.S. Team Coach/Technical Advisor\n\nMcDonald squeezing Graves' cheeks\n\nat the 2016 CDIO Rotterdam McDonald also worked for USEF as U.S. Dressage Development Coach as of 2009 and moved into the Technical Advisor position in 2019, succeeding Robert Dover.\n\nIn 2022 her USEF contract was not renewed as McDonald was named, along with her husband Bob McDonald and the 32nd District Agricultural Association (California), as defendants in a civil lawsuit. The suit was dismissed in March 2022 and McDonald got rehired as Technical Advisor (read team trainer) at the start of 2023 but ended the contract prematurely on 1 August 1, 2023 instead of until the 2024 Olympics.\n\nLate 2023 Heidi Humphries of Zen Elite equestrian center took over the baton from Juliano as Lyle's principle sponsor and provider of horses. Humphries bought Helix and Lars van de Hoenderheide for Adrienne as Paris Olympic hopefuls while Salvino was retired from sport. It was Helix that took her to Games in Paris with McDonald by her side as Adrienne's personal trainer.\n\nBack to Idaho\n\nBreakthrough on Brentina in Jerez Debbie McDonald, who first broke through as a rider at the 2002 World Equestrian Games, introduced herself at the press conference in Jerez as \"I'm from Sun Valley, Idaho, a ski resort.\" Debbie's one-hit-wonder was Brentina, a Hanoverian mare that won her the 1999 Pan American Games, the 2003 World Cup Finals, and team bronze at the 2004 Olympics and 2006 World Equestrian Games.\n\nAlthough she spent the majority of her time in Florida as a personal and U.S. Team trainer in the 2010s, McDonald never cut ties with Idaho. She has now returned home to Hailey, ID to spend more time with her family and grandchild.\n\n\"Inner Excellence\"\n\nWhile Debbie will no longer be the lead trainer for some elite riders in Florida, a group of squad riders have decided to rely on each other and made a \"trainers' union\" called \"Inner Excellence.\" The group includes riders such as Lyle, Perry, Bateson, Brock and more.\n\n\"Our goal at our barn is to carry on her (Debbie's) legacy of soft and compassionate training. I have expanded my network of eyes on the ground so I have people who are based in Wellington able to help as well,\" Adrienne told Eurodressage. \"We have such a great pool of knowledge riders here in Wellington to help each other, and the camaraderie between riders is fun to build as well.\"\n\nAt the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris At the last World Cup qualifier in Wellington, where Adrienne secured her ticket to the 2025 World Cup Finals in Basel, it was Ali Brock by her side as eyes on the ground.\n\n\"I am looping Ali into the coaching pool and she's been fantastic, as well as some outside clinicians (Kyra Kyrklund), and I have Katie Duerhammer, who has been my student for 11 years, keep an eye on me and make sure i'm holding myself up the standard of excellence I want in my daily work,\" said Adrienne. \"I think it can be so beneficial to have your peers there to watch you a little each day and make sure you don't allow bad habits to slip in. All the riders at my barn do this for each other. It elevates us all when we hold each other to the highest standard and support each other.\"\n\nPhotos \u00a9 Astrid Appels - Mary Phelps\n\nRelated Links\n\nDebbie McDonald Resigns Prematurely as U.S. Dressage Technical Advisor\n\nPeggy Thomas, Long-time Supporter of U.S. Dressage, Passed Away\n\nIn Memoriam: Parry Thomas (1921-2016) Leaves Legacy on U.S. Dressage\n\nAmerican Syndicate Acquires Sandronnerhall for Adrienne Lyle\n\nU.S. Grand Prix Horse Harmony's Duval Retired from Sport\n\nDebbie McDonald Returns as U.S. Dressage Technical Advisor after One-Year Hiatus\n\nUSEF Puts U.S. Dressage Technical Advisor Contract Decision on Hold\n\nDebbie McDonald to Succeed Dover as U.S. Dressage Technical Advisor\n\nDebbie McDonald to Lead USEF Developing Dressage Program",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stands against other best stocks to buy for financial stability.\n\nInvesting in stocks is one of the most effective ways to build long-term financial stability. While stocks can be volatile in the short term, history has shown that they generate higher returns over time compared to other asset classes. With the right strategy, investing in stocks can help individuals accumulate wealth, hedge against inflation, and secure a comfortable retirement. Stocks have historically outperformed other investment vehicles, such as bonds and savings accounts. According to data from the S&P 500, the stock market has delivered an average annual return of about 10% before inflation over the past century. In contrast, bonds have yielded around 5\u20136%, while traditional savings accounts provide returns of less than 1% annually. Recent studies reinforce this trend. A 2024 report from JP Morgan Asset Management found that over any 20-year period, the likelihood of losing money in the stock market is close to zero. Even with market downturns, those who stay invested tend to see significant growth.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe power of compounding is a key reason why investing in stocks enhances financial stability. The earlier an individual starts investing, the greater the impact of compounding. For example, if an investor puts $5,000 annually into an index fund earning 8% per year, they would accumulate approximately $1.3 million over 40 years.

Sign up for the First & 4Most morning newsletter \u2014 delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.\n\nHere's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $2.83 adjusted, meeting expectations\n\n$2.83 adjusted, meeting expectations Revenue: $6.39 billion vs. $6.44 billion expected\n\nNet sales of $6.39 billion were roughly flat compared with the year-ago period. The company's overall same-store sales growth of 0.4% outperformed Wall Street's expectations of same-store sales declines of 1%, according to StreetAccount estimates.\n\nBut McDonald's U.S. business reported a steeper-than-expected drop in its same-store sales. Same-store sales at the company's domestic restaurants fell 1.4% in the quarter; Wall Street was projecting same-store sales declines of 0.6%.\n\nMcDonald's said traffic was slightly positive, but customers spent less than usual during the quarter. Over the summer, the chain rolled out a $5 combo meal to bring back price-conscious diners and reverse sluggish sales. The strategy worked, helping McDonald's U.S. same-store sales tick up in the third quarter.\n\nHowever, analysts have warned that value meals only work if customers also add menu items that aren't discounted to their orders. McDonald's executives downplayed those concerns Monday, saying the average check on the $5 meal deal is more than $10.\n\nThe biggest hit to McDonald's U.S. sales came in late October, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked a fatal E. coli outbreak to its Quarter Pounder burgers. McDonald's switched suppliers for its slivered onions, the ingredient fingered as the likely culprit for the outbreak. In early December, the CDC declared the outbreak officially over.\n\nHowever, in the days following the news of the outbreak, traffic at McDonald's U.S. restaurants fell steeply, particularly in the states affected.\n\nU.S. sales hit their nadir in early November, but began rising again after that. In particular, demand for the Quarter Pounder, a popular core menu item with high margins, fell quickly in the wake of the crisis.\n\nMcDonald's expects its U.S. sales to recover by the beginning of the second quarter, executives said.\n\n\"I think right now what we're seeing is that the E. coli impact is now just localized to the areas that had the biggest impact,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's conference call. \"So think about that as sort of the Rocky Mountain region that was really the epicenter of the issue.\"\n\nThe company hopes value deals, along with key menu additions, will help to fuel the recovery this year. In 2025, the burger chain plans to bring back its popular snack wraps, which vanished from menus during pandemic lockdowns, and to introduce a new chicken strip menu item.\n\nOutside the U.S., sales were stronger. Both of McDonald's international divisions reported same-store sales increases, bolstering the company's overall performance.\n\nThe company's international developmental licensed markets segment, which includes the Middle East and Japan, reported same-store sales growth of 4.1%.\n\nMcDonald's international operated markets division, which includes some of its biggest markets, reported same-store sales growth of 0.1%. The company said most markets reported same-store sales increases, but the United Kingdom and some other markets saw same-store sales shrink in the quarter. One bright spot was France, which saw its same-store sales turn positive during the quarter after months of weak demand.\n\nMcDonald's reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.02 billion, or $2.80 per share, down from $2.04 billion, or $2.80 per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding gains tied to the sale of its South Korean business, transaction costs for buying its Israeli franchise and other items, McDonald's earned $2.83 per share.\n\nLooking to 2025, the first quarter is expected to be the low point for McDonald's same-store sales, CFO Ian Borden said, citing a weak start to the year in the U.S., among other factors. Winter storms and wildfires in California weighed on restaurant traffic across the industry in January.\n\nFor the full year, McDonald's plans to open roughly 2,200 restaurants. About a quarter of those locations will be in the U.S. and its international operated markets. The rest will be in the company's international developmental licensed markets, including about 1,000 new restaurants in China.\n\nIncluding its investments in restaurant openings, McDonald's plans to spend between $3 billion and $3.2 billion this year on capital expenditures.\n\nThe company is also projecting a headwind of 20 cents to 30 cents per share to its full-year earnings due to foreign currency exchange rates.",

            "content": "The world's best-known hamburger chain isn't a top-of-mind name to most investors on the hunt for a big winner. Should it be?\n\nThere's no denying McDonald's (MCD 0.85%) is the premier name of the fast-food industry. Not only is it the business's biggest hamburger chain (as measured by the number of locales and revenue), but its operation has become the gold standard for how the restaurant franchise business should be managed. That's why McDonald's stock is such a reliable winner.\n\nBut a millionaire maker? That's a different story. McDonald's is still ultimately subject to the health of the fast-food business, which just isn't a high-growth industry. It could take a long while for a modest investment in this stock to turn into a seven-figure sum.\n\nExcept, there's a secret sauce helping out here that could do the job much faster than you might think.\n\nBut first things first.\n\nWhat McDonald's is... and isn't\n\nYou of course know the company. As was noted, with nearly 43,000 stores, McDonald's is not only the biggest burger name in the restaurant business, but arguably the best-known and most nostalgic -- a dynamic still working in the fast-food chain's favor.\n\nIt may not quite be the company you think it is, however. Only about 5% of these locations are actually owned and operated by the parent company itself. The other 95% of its restaurants are franchises, managed by individuals and third parties looking to leverage the powerful brand name into a profit.\n\nOn the surface, that may seem like a trivial detail. All restaurant franchises agree to run their business in accordance with the franchisor's requirements, after all, and purchase their supplies and ingredients from approved providers. In turn, the franchisor helps support and promote the brand.\n\nThere are a couple of distinct differences between McDonald's and most other fast-food chains, though. First, McDonald's capital requirements, royalties, fees, and operational expectations are collectively higher than the restaurant franchise industry's average. And second, unlike almost all other fast-food franchises, McDonald's franchisees don't actually own the building from which they operate. They rent it from the parent, paying ever-rising market-based prices for this access.\n\nThat's why McDonald's is often described one of the world's biggest real estate companies -- it owns more than $40 billion worth of property and related equipment. And yes, this makes a world of difference to its shareholders.\n\nIt certainly works in McDonald's shareholders' favor\n\nSimply put, McDonald's franchisees are bearing the brunt of the business risk here. The parent company's royalty rates are between 4% and 5% of each locale's gross sales, whether that store is profitable. Each location's monthly rent payments are also a percentage of that store's revenue, again without regard to that store's profitability.\n\nConnect the dots: Even if store operating costs soar, the McDonald's corporation itself isn't impacted much. Its revenue continues to flow and even grow, at least in step with inflation. The upshot for shareholders is decades' worth of usually steady revenue and subsequent profit growth.\n\nThe real star of the show, however, is McDonald's dividend. Not only has the company paid one like clockwork since 1976, but it's now raised its annual per-share dividend payment every year for the past 48 years. More to the point, it's been able to afford this steady cadence of dividend growth. This streak isn't apt to end anytime soon either, given McDonald's sheer size and its mastery of the fast-food business.\n\nBut the bigger question remains: Could McDonald's be a millionaire-maker stock?\n\nYes, it could, although there's an important detail to inject into the discussion.\n\nThe key to making the most of McDonald's stock\n\nMcDonald's clearly isn't a growth stock in the same vein as, say Nvidia or Amazon. The fast-food industry is already pretty well saturated, so most future growth will stem from mere population growth, even for the strongest name in the business. To this end, this company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) has only grown an average of about 3.3% per year for the past several years.\n\nBut there's a reason that McDonald's stock's price has improved by nearly 1,700% over the course of the past 30 years. That's the other way the restaurant franchiser has added value: by repurchasing shares circulating in the open market. For the same time frame, this company has used some of its reliable profits to halve its outstanding share count from roughly 1.4 billion to just over 700 million, improving every per-share fiscal metric as a result.\n\nThis is only half of the secret millionaire-making sauce, though. The other half is using the growing dividends this company is dishing out to purchase more and more shares of its increasingly valuable stock. By reinvesting the dividends McDonald's has been paying since then, a $30,000 investment made back in early 1994 would be worth $1 million today.\n\nObviously, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Indeed, it would be outright naive to pretend the environment and opportunity that was so fruitful for this company over the course of the past 30 years is the same environment it will be operating in for the next 30. Interested investors should pay particularly close to attention to how interested existing and prospective franchisees remain in this fast-food chain's decreasingly attractive franchising terms.\n\nStill, winners tend to remain winners if only due to what's usually an enormous size that keeps competitors in check. If nothing else, McDonald's at least brings that sort of muscle to the table.\n\nThe key for you is simply leaving it alone and letting time -- and dividend reinvestment -- do the bulk of the work.",

The quintessentially Southern beverage is a staple in many households, kept always in a plastic pitcher in the fridge, ready for drinking with dinner or for sipping as relief from the oppressive heat of a summer day. The drink is simple: It consists of black tea brewed very strong and very dark, with sugar added while still hot before the mixture is placed in the fridge to cool. It is served over ice, sometimes with a wedge of lemon for taste. To some, the drink is incomprehensibly too sweet and too strong. But those who love it really love it, and won't settle for just any sweet tea. That's why sweet tea fans probably ought to avoid McDonald's.\n\nThe problem with McDonald's tea is simple \u2013 it's simply too sweet. Additionally, the consistency of McDonald's sweet tea can best be described as syrupy or thick, a clear sign that too much sugar was added during the steeping process. Since hot water helps dissolve sugar, more sweetener can be added when the water is hot. The downside to this is it can be easy to use too much sugar, turning your sweet tea into a black tea syrup in a matter of no time, which looks to be McDonald's' problem.",

Mike\u2019s childhood was spent in Quincy and he always valued time with his family \u2013 from growing up with his dear mother and sisters, to marrying his love and starting a family of his own, and for close to the last decade spending as much time with his grandchildren as possible.\n\nAn alumnus of Catholic Memorial High School and Boston College, Mike started working for the government as a Treasury Agent but soon went on to a career as a Private Investigator, which he very much enjoyed. Mike took pride in solving cases and finding lost heirs to estates.\n\nSkiing was a favorite activity for Mike \u2013 first with friends and then his family. He was a dedicated father who attended every game, concert, and recital. Mike spent many seasons coaching his kids\u2019 soccer teams and for a few years volunteered to run the Lynnfield travel soccer program.\n\nDuring his retired years Mike enjoyed time at the lake house, or sitting by the pool on Patrice Lane. A passionate Patriots fan, Mike also kept up with the news and was an avid runner for most of his life. Above all, time spent with family \u2013 both immediate and extended \u2013 from parties, holidays, events, or just sitting on the couch together, brought Mike joy.\n\nHe was the loving husband of Ruthie (Andrews) Trainor and the beloved father of Christine Barnes and her husband Chris of Lynnfield, and Matthew Trainor and his wife Laura of Lynnfield.

            "content": "By JOAN JOUPPI\n\nFor The Daily News\n\nKINGSFORD \u2014 Stepping up to the podium, first time chairperson for the Golden K, Candy Buchcuski, met the challenge head-on. It was obvious by her leadership and ease that she is not a stranger to public speaking.\n\nWith gavel in hand, she led the group through opening ceremonies with a definite purpose in mind. Pianist Alyce Derwinski always comes prepared with a list of songs. She hands them off to Richard Ochoa and together they have the seniors singing. Tunes began with \u201cThis Land is Your Land,\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s Sorry Now,\u201d and ended on a bright note with \u201cYou Are My Sunshine.\u201d\n\nThe welcome song was sung for Stacey Lantangne and Bill Roberts picked up winnings from the 50-50 drawing. Members were reminded of the Valentine\u2019s party Feb. 17 for the children with special needs on. Preparations will begin at 9 a.m. In the event of bad weather, gift bags will still be put together and distributed to the various schools.\n\nChairperson Buchcuski introduced her daughter and the day\u2019s guest speaker, Stacey Lantagne. Lantagne runs a Crafts on Central in Florence, Wis. About one year ago, her family was faced with tragedy and incredible challenge as her grandson, Ezra, began having seizures from an unknown cause. Today\u2019s presentation took us on a journey of hope and support that gave Ezra the opportunity to survive and thrive.\n\nAt the forefront of the tale is the tremendous support of the community through The Ronald McDonald House. Lantagne led us through a PowerPoint presentation of the story. After a seemingly simple fall, Ezra went into seizures and the family quickly realized something was terribly wrong. After some testing, the local hospital determined the child needed advanced care. He was airlifted to Milwaukee Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nEzra was fighting for his life and the family was in a state of uncertainty. As medical personnel desperately attempted to diagnose the problem, finding a place to stay became necessary.\n\nAttached to the hospital was The Ronald McDonald House, which quickly became their home away from home.\n\nThe Ronald McDonald House is a worldwide program with more than 180,000 volunteers. They have more than 1,000 programs, including a home away from home that provides comfort, support and resources to families who travel far from home for the medical care of their child. The property had several statues of the famous clown mascot, which give a feeling that his spirit was watching over them.\n\nLantagne shared her family\u2019s experience and why the RMH is so important to families in medical crises. Being able to focus on a child\u2019s recovery rather than worrying about where they can sleep, eases some of the stress. RMH offers a place to stay and many other amenities such as meals, transportation, and emotional support. There was a playroom for kids, so they could forget the hospital concerns for a while. Laundry facilities, quiet areas, computers, printers, coffee bars and to-go lunches are just a few of the things offered to make the experience easier for families.\n\nUpon check-in, the parents were given a token. It could be redeemed upon the release of their child from the hospital. The child is able to take the token to the \u201cWish Room\u201d and pick out any toy they choose. Ezra has returned home and is happily running about as every child should. He is doing well and the family is hopeful he will continue to lead a good life.\n\nThe famous arches are not just about food. It is also a community of dedicated people focusing on helping children and families get through a medical crisis.\n\nBecause of their experience, the Lantagne family along with their community began a \u201cgiving back\u201d crusade. They collected donations and pop can tabs to donate to RMH. Through fundraising efforts they transported three loaded vehicles of needed items to RMH in Milwaukee.\n\nIn addition, the entire family pitched in to provide an authentic, home-cooked Italian dinner for about 80 people housed at the center. They continue to collect donated items and are grateful for the prayers and support they have received.\n\nMore information and ways to help can be found on the RMH website at https://rmhc.org/\n\nGolden K will meet at 10 a.m. Monday at the First Presbyterian Church in Kingsford. All are welcome.",

            "content": "Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nMcDonald v. City of Chicago, case in which on June 28, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (5\u20134) that the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\u201d applies to state and local governments as well as to the federal government.\n\nThe case arose in 2008, when Otis McDonald, a retired African American custodian, and others filed suit in U.S. District Court to challenge provisions of a 1982 Chicago law that, among other things, generally banned the new registration of handguns and made registration a prerequisite of possession of a firearm. The next day the National Rifle Association and others filed separate lawsuits challenging the Chicago law and an Oak Park, Ill., law that generally prohibited the possession or carrying of handguns and the carrying of other firearms except rifles or shotguns in one\u2019s home or place of business. Each suit alleged that the law violated the right of individuals to possess and carry weapons, which the Supreme Court had found to be protected by the Second Amendment in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008). (Anticipating this finding, the plaintiffs in McDonald v. City of Chicago filed suit on the same morning that the decision in Heller was announced.) The crucial question, however, was whether the Second Amendment is applicable to the states and their political subdivisions. Citing \u201cselective incorporation,\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s gradual application to the states of most of the protections of the Bill of Rights through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (which prohibits the states from denying life, liberty, or property without due process of law), the plaintiffs argued that the Second Amendment is applicable through that clause as well as through the amendment\u2019s \u201cprivileges or immunities\u201d clause (which forbids the states from abridging the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States).\n\nThe district court dismissed the suits. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit consolidated the cases and affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision, noting that it was compelled to adhere to precedents in which \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2026rebuffed requests to apply the second amendment to the states.\u201d The Supreme Court granted certiorari to the plaintiffs in McDonald on Sept. 30, 2009, and oral arguments were heard on March 2, 2010.\n\nBritannica Quiz All-American History Quiz\n\nIn its ruling, the Supreme Court reversed and remanded the appellate court\u2019s decision. Writing for the majority, Samuel A. Alito, Jr., argued on the basis of Heller that the Second Amendment is incorporated\u2014i.e., that it should be selectively incorporated as applicable to the states through the due process clause\u2014because the individual right to possess and use firearms for traditionally lawful purposes, particularly self-defense, is fundamental to the American \u201cscheme of ordered liberty and system of justice.\u201d Essentially that standard, the court maintained, was applied by the Supreme Court in the 1960s to incorporate a number of rights related to criminal procedure, including the right to trial by jury (Duncan v. Louisiana [1968]). The court held that the Duncan standard constituted a departure from the less-inclusive test that had been used in incorporation cases since the late 19th century\u2014namely, whether the right is of \u201cthe very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty\u201d (Palko v. Connecticut [1937]) or a \u201cprinciple of natural equity, recognized by all temperate and civilized governments\u201d (Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co. v. Chicago [1897; Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co. v. Chicago]). The incorporation precedents established on the Duncan standard thus compelled the court to reject on stare decisis grounds the defendant\u2019s main argument, that the Second Amendment is not incorporated because it is possible to imagine (and indeed there are) civilized legal systems in which an individual right to possess and use firearms is not recognized. The plaintiff\u2019s argument that the Second Amendment is incorporated under the privileges or immunities clause was also dismissed. Alito\u2019s opinion was joined in full by John G. Roberts, Jr., and in part by Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas; Scalia and Thomas also filed separate concurring opinions.\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, which was joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer claimed that Heller\u2019s historical analysis was flawed and that historical evidence bearing upon the fundamental character of a \u201cprivate armed self-defense right\u201d was unclear at best. Whether the right is incorporated, therefore, must be decided on the basis of other factors, such as the ascertainable motivations of the framers of the Constitution; whether there is contemporary agreement that the right is fundamental; and whether enforcing the right against the states would (as it does in the case of other incorporated rights) further the broader objectives of the Constitution, including fostering equal respect for individuals, maintaining a democratic form of government, and creating well-functioning institutions based on a constitutional separation of powers. When properly considered, according to Breyer, each of those factors argues against incorporation.\n\nJohn Paul Stevens, in a separate dissent issued on the last day of his tenure on the Supreme Court, held that the majority had misunderstood the scope and purpose of the Palko and Duncan standards and that its strictly historical approach to incorporation was untenable.",

            "content": "A federal judge on Wednesday ruled that a California couple who built a home without a permit on the bank of McDonald Creek in Glacier National Park did so legally, and that a local conservation district that ordered the home\u2019s demolition, as well as the damaged streambed\u2019s restoration, has no jurisdictional authority to enforce state environmental protection laws.\n\nFor John and Stacy Ambler, the defendants in the case, the order granting them summary judgment in their lawsuit against the Flathead Conservation District (FCD) is a clear victory; however, it raises questions about which entity, if not the state of Montana, holds jurisdictional authority over private property owners who wish to develop isolated parcels within the boundaries of Glacier National Park.\n\nRob Farris-Olsen, an attorney representing Friends of Montana Streams and Rivers (FMSR), a group of West Glacier and Apgar residents who joined the lawsuit as intervenors in the case, both to support the FCD\u2019s position as well as to represent themselves as stakeholders, said the order relegates the property to a sort of jurisdictional gray area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that you cannot construct anything within a national park without a permit, and there were no permits granted in the case,\u201d Farris-Olsen said Thursday morning after reviewing the order. \u201cIf the park has exclusive jurisdiction, I don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t require a permit for the construction of the Amblers\u2019 house. Right now it seems like there\u2019s no real regulation over those private inholdings.\u201d\n\nThe absence of any real regulation over private inholdings means that the Amblers\u2019 partially completed three-story home, the construction of which the FCD\u2019s board of supervisors placed under a cease-and-desist order in April 2023, exists in a sort of jurisdictional limbo and can remain. However, defendants have 30 days to decide whether to appeal this week\u2019s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit, which determination Farris-Olsen said he and FCD\u2019s counsel will make in the coming weeks after meeting with their respective clients.\n\nIn order to successfully appeal the case, however, the Ninth Circuit would have to reverse the logic it applied in a 1968 water rights case, Macomber v. Bose, in which it determined that Montana ceded, and the United States accepted, exclusive jurisdiction over privately owned land located within the boundaries of Glacier National Park.\n\nThe defendants contend that when Congress created Glacier National Park in 1910, it expressly excluded property held in private ownership prior to the park\u2019s creation.\n\nBased on her interpretation of the case law, to which she is bound, U.S. Magistrate Judge Kathleen DeSoto disagreed.\n\n\u201cEven if FMSR\u2019s reading \u2026 is correct, its argument is in effect that the Ninth Circuit got it wrong in concluding that Montana ceded, and the United States accepted, jurisdiction over privately owned land within the boundaries of Glacier National Park,\u201d according to DeSoto\u2019s 42-page order, which she issued Feb. 5. \u201cThe Court is bound by Macomber, which forecloses FMSR\u2019s argument to the contrary and makes clear that the federal government has legislative jurisdiction over private inholdings within the park, including the Ambler property.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of FCD\u2019s and FMSR\u2019s argument is that the home\u2019s location within the park\u2019s boundaries does not preempt the enforcement of the state\u2019s foremost streambed protection law, the Montana Natural Streambed and Land Protection Act (NSLPA). In the absence of analogous federal law, FCD attorney Camisha Sawtelle said criteria surrounding the construction of a home on a private parcel girded by National Park Service land should default to the state law\u2019s regulatory arm.\n\nThe Amblers say only Glacier National Park can govern private inholdings, stating the FCD \u201ccannot unilaterally reassert jurisdiction over lands to which the State of Montana long ago ceded jurisdiction to the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only issue in this case is federal versus state jurisdiction over the Amblers\u2019 property,\u201d Trent Baker, the Amblers\u2019 attorney, wrote in their motion for summary judgment, which asked the judge to rule in favor of the couple and resolve the jurisdictional question without going to trial.\n\nThe case began locally when residents in the West Glacier area complained about the Amblers\u2019 construction project, clearly visible to park visitors and neighbors, which prompted FCD to conduct an onsite inspection. Following the inspection, FCD determined the Amblers had violated the NSLPA (better known as the 310 law) by building on an immediate bank of McDonald Creek and excavating the stream bank to create a pad for construction, all without obtaining the necessary 310 permit, the statute\u2019s key enforcement provision.\n\nMcDonald Creek as viewed from near Bird Woman Falls Overlook along Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park on April 24, 2023. Hunter D\u2019Antuono | Flathead Beacon\n\nThe FCD ruled that the Amblers must remove the home and remediate the streambed. However, the couple challenged the FCD\u2019s jurisdictional authority in the case and proceeded to what\u2019s called a declaratory ruling process, which was overseen by hearing officer Laurie Zeller, a retired bureau chief with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC).\n\nAfter reaffirming its jurisdictional authority, Zeller remanded the case back to the FCD, whose Board of Supervisors ruled that the couple must remove the home and repair the streambed no later than April 1, 2024.\n\nInstead, the Amblers filed lawsuits in state and federal courts, arguing that the FCD overstepped its authority by ordering the home\u2019s removal. As the legal saga drags on, the unfinished home remains visible to onlookers from the Camas Road.\n\nThe question at the center of last month\u2019s oral arguments was whether FCD has jurisdiction to enforce the 310 law, which states that any private individual or entity proposing work in or near a stream that \u201cphysically alters or modifies the bed or immediate banks of a perennial-flowing stream\u201d must first obtain an approved permit from the local conservation district.\n\nAccording to the Amblers, neither Flathead County nor Glacier National Park required any permits to begin construction on the property and connect the residence to the Apgar Village water and sewer system.\n\n\u201cGlacier National Park allowed the construction and allowed the Amblers to connect to the Apgar Village water and sewer system,\u201d the federal complaint from the plaintiffs states. \u201cThe Amblers dispute that the FCD has jurisdiction over the property and dispute that the NSLPA applies to the property.\u201d\n\nThe defendants contend that even if the private parcel is under exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government, the construction of a home on the immediate bank of a perennial stream without a permit constitutes a nuisance under federal law, violates the National Environmental Policy Act and violates a federal statute providing that \u201cno permit, license, lease or other authorization\u201d shall be granted for the erection and maintenance of summer homes or cottages within Glacier National Park.\n\nThey also argue that state entities have jurisdiction to enforce the Streambed Act on private inholdings because the statute is consistent with the purpose for which Glacier National Park was created.\n\nBut DeSoto in her order wrote those arguments \u201cgo beyond the scope of the sole claim asserted in the complaint \u2026 that FCD lacks jurisdiction over the Ambler property, and that the Streambed Act does not apply.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn sum, the Court concludes that FCD lacks jurisdiction to enforce the Streambed Act on the Ambler Property because Montana has ceded exclusive jurisdiction over all land within the boundaries of Glacier National Park \u2014 including private inholdings \u2014 to the federal government,\u201d according to DeSoto\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cIn reaching this conclusion, the Court is bound by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Macomber, which held that Montana\u2019s cession of jurisdiction over Glacier National Park included not only the public lands dedicated to park purposes by the United states but all privately owned lands within the described park boundaries,\u201d DeSoto wrote, adding that \u201cby this cession and acceptance, federal authority became the only authority operating within the ceded areas.\u201d\n\nAlthough state law \u201ctheretofore applicable within the ceded area at the time of the cession was assimilated as federal law \u2026 the Streambed Act was not in effect at the time of the cession and was not assimilated for the reasons explained above,\u201d DeSoto wrote in the order. \u201cAccordingly, under binding Ninth Circuit precedent, FCD lacks jurisdiction to enforce the Streambed Act on the Amblers\u2019 private inholding within Glacier National Park.\u201d\n\n[email protected]",

(WMC) - An 18-year-old McDonald\u2019s employee is facing several weapon charges after his alleged involvement in a shootout at work that left a colleague shot in the foot.\n\nThe Memphis Police Department has charged Kaden Stewart with aggravated assault, reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon, and unlawful possession of a weapon.\n\nThe incident reportedly took place last Tuesday at the McDonald\u2019s located at 1389 Poplar Avenue near North Cleveland Street.\n\nAccording to the arrest affidavit, Stewart was involved in an argument with a coworker while on shift.\n\nThe manager on shift told police that she separated the two, but the brother of the coworker Stewart fought with, who is also an employee, entered the restaurant with a handgun, re-escalating the situation.\n\nPolice allege that Stewart then pulled out his own firearm and began shooting at his armed colleague from the back of the kitchen.\n\nStewart\u2019s target reportedly returned fire, all while patrons and other McDonald\u2019s employees were inside.\n\nMPD says that the business was hit multiple times and an employee uninvolved in the brawl was struck in the ankle.\n\nShelby County Jail records show that the second employee who fired gunshots inside the restaurant has not been charged, likely because he is a minor.\n\nStewart\u2019s bond has not been set. He is due in court Friday morning.\n\nClick here to sign up for our newsletter!\n\nClick here to report a spelling or grammar error. Please include the headline.\n\nCopyright 2025 WMC.

Through his brush, he works to depict bodies, hands and skulls to evoke a sense of beauty and symmetry with a topic that often feels unsettling or uncomfortable.\n\n\u201c[Death] is a part of our lives.

Since then, it\u2019s always stuck with me as something I knew that I wanted to do.\n\nHigh school was when I was lucky enough to be part of the LPS Arts and Humanities Focus Program. It was the second year they were open. I was not a great student at all, and I was actually on the way to almost getting kicked out of high school. Luckily, I was able to go to Arts and Humanities and I think that was a turning point for me. It kind of showed me that I could have an opportunity to do art as a thing.\n\nScott McDonald | Custodial Services Three skull paintings by Scott McDonald. His work has been featured in exhibitions across Lincoln. Learn more about McDonald's work at https://scottmcdonaldartist.com.\n\nTalk about your journey working up from custodial staff to a managerial position.\n\nIt started when I was 22, and I was looking for a job and had some custodial experience from a past job. I joined as a custodian and saw the potential to move up and continue my employment at the university. I\u2019ve been with the university for 16 years now, and I always tell people I sort of fell up.\n\nI always enjoyed busy work and I\u2019m a big night person, so working nights has been a great experience for me. Since then, I\u2019ve been able to work with a lot of different people, and it\u2019s been a great experience.\n\nHas anyone at the university had a significant impact on you or your art?\n\nNo one specifically, but as a custodian I\u2019m allowed to wander around some of the other buildings. So I\u2019ll wander through some of the art buildings and check out other people\u2019s work. It's fun to see students work throughout the years and secretly be a part of that experience.\n\nWho or what inspires your art?\n\nI started painting with watercolor about 10 years ago, and I had never painted with it before. I\u2019ve always been kind of influenced by the classics, but I\u2019m not traditionally trained at all. So I struggle when people ask me about my art because I don\u2019t have a strong art history background.\n\nSpecifically, I like to draw influence from a lot of different artists like William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Salvador Dal\u00ed and Jeremy Geddes.\n\nWas there a point in your life where a light bulb went on that you wanted to pursue art?\n\nI stopped doing art for a long time, but one day I drew a picture for a friend. They had an idea for something they wanted, and I just drew the picture for it and I was like, oh yeah, I forgot how much I like this. That turned into wanting to do something for myself, and it kept snowballing from there. And then my wife just randomly set me up for a show at a coffee house. She didn't tell me; she just told the owner that I was going to do it. So that pushed me.\n\nThat was my starting point, and I started showing my art at coffee houses around town, and then bars, and that led to galleries and things like that. It's been pretty exciting.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most unusual or surprising thing you\u2019ve used to create a piece of art?\n\nSince I started showing off my art, I\u2019ve been collecting replica skulls and things like that. I\u2019ve been building up my collection more and more. So people are kind of weirded out when they come into my studio and there\u2019s a gallery of skulls around. Other than that, my art is pretty straightforward.\n\nTake us through your journey as an artist. How has your art evolved over the years?\n\nWhen I first started, I was painting in a strange, abstract, cartoony style. People called it dark, I guess. I like to paint a lot of skulls and a lot of pieces that represent life and death, so it\u2019s definitely evolved from kind of a strange abstract style to more realistic pieces that focus on anatomy.\n\nWhat would you tell current students, graduates or faculty working hard to achieve their dreams?\n\nFor me, I found that I started saying yes more, and that helped me get over a fear of showing my work. Eventually, there\u2019s going to be the right person who sees your work and makes it all worth it. One step always led to another show and to the next, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s been for me. I would say don\u2019t be afraid to show off your work, because you never know what can happen.",

            "content": "Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nAudra McDonald (born July 3, 1970, West Berlin, West Germany [now Berlin, Germany]) is an American actress and singer whose melodious soprano voice and expressive stage presence made her a primary figure on Broadway in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nMcDonald was raised in Fresno, California, by a family of musicians\u2014her parents were pianists and singers, and five of her aunts toured the West Coast as the singing McDonald Sisters in the 1970s. McDonald began taking voice lessons and performing at a local dinner theatre when she was age nine. She continued to perform in high school, assuming the lead roles in several musicals, and pursued further vocal training at the Juilliard School in New York City (B.A., 1993).\n\nSoon after graduating, McDonald was cast in a touring production of The Secret Garden (1993). She quickly attracted attention the following year when she was cast as the fecund Carrie Snow in British director Nicholas Hytner\u2019s revival of Carousel. The supporting role earned her a Tony Award. McDonald also demonstrated her abilities as a dramatic actress when she performed the role of a young opera student in Terrence McNally\u2019s play Master Class (1996), for which she won another Tony. She made her film debut in the drama Seven Servants (1997), playing an opera singer. Her third Tony was awarded for her stage role as Sarah in McNally\u2019s musical Ragtime (1998).\n\nBritannica Quiz Pop Culture Quiz\n\nMcDonald\u2019s appearance in the title role of Marie Christine (1999), a musical retelling of Medea, written especially for her by Michael LaChiusa, marked her first leading role on Broadway. Though the critical approbation elicited by her acting was significant, it was exceeded by the attention paid to her lustrous lyric soprano. She controlled her voice to exquisite effect, navigating a score composed in an amalgam of musical styles.\n\nMcDonald expanded her repertoire to include Shakespeare with a 2003 performance as Lady Percy in Henry IV. Her turn as Ruth Younger in a revival of Lorraine Hansberry\u2019s A Raisin in the Sun (2004) secured a fourth Tony. In 2007 McDonald starred as Lizzie Currie in the musical 110 in the Shade. That year she also sang the role of Jenny in the opera The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny. She received her first Tony Award as a leading actress for her performance as Bess in a 2012 musical theatre adaptation of George and Ira Gershwin\u2019s folk opera Porgy and Bess. McDonald also starred in the Broadway play Lady Day at Emerson\u2019s Bar & Grill and won a Tony Award (2014) for her portrayal of jazz singer Billie Holiday in that production, which tells of the singer\u2019s final months of performance before her death in 1959. McDonald was the first person to win six Tonys for acting. Her later Broadway credits included Shuffle Along (2016) and Ohio State Murders (2022). In the latter, written by Adrienne Kennedy, McDonald played a writer dealing with a traumatic past. Both the production and her performance earned particular praise.\n\nAs well as acting and singing in stage productions, McDonald gave numerous solo performances. At Carnegie Hall in 2005 she premiered a specially commissioned song cycle entitled The Seven Deadly Sins, composed of seven pieces written for her by different composers. She was a guest vocalist with the New York, Los Angeles, and Berlin philharmonic orchestras. Between stage productions, she toured in support of her solo albums Way Back to Paradise (1998), How Glory Goes (2000), Happy Songs (2002), Build a Bridge (2006), and Go Back Home (2013). Sing Happy (2018) was recorded with the New York Philharmonic.\n\nMcDonald made a number of film and television appearances. Her notable TV credits included adaptations of several plays, including Wit (2001), A Raisin in the Sun (2008), and Lady Day at Emerson\u2019s Bar & Grill (2016), all of which earned the actress Emmy Award nominations. In 2007\u201313 McDonald had a recurring role in the television drama Private Practice, and she later appeared in The Good Fight. She also starred in the miniseries The Bite (2021), a satire set during an outbreak of a virus that can turn people into zombies, and was cast in The Gilded Age (2022\u2013 ), an HBO drama that centres on New York high society in the late 19th century. Her film credits included Beauty and the Beast (2017), a live-action remake of the Disney animated classic, and the Aretha Franklin biopic Respect (2021).",

As a family-owned business rooted in small-town values, they pride themselves on fostering local connections and offering flexible in-house financing to support their customers.\n\nThe former Badcock Furniture & More building at 1590 Northside Drive East has a fresh new look and name, now home to Gibson McDonald Furniture Mattress and Appliance. The family-owned business, based in Blackshear, Georgia, quietly opened its doors at the start of November 2024, marking its 12th location and a significant milestone for the company that\u2019s been in operation since 1934.\n\nBrothers Mark and Rees Gibson are continuing the family tradition into its fourth generation. The company\u2019s deep roots in Georgia now extend to Statesboro, a city with personal ties for Branham Gay, Gibson McDonald systems and marketing director.\n\n\u201cStatesboro holds a special place in our hearts,\u201d Gay shared. Having grown up on his family farm in Jenkins County, Gay later attended Georgia Southern University, where he met his wife, Shelly, Rees Gibson's daughter and a fellow Eagle. With family and friends still calling Statesboro home, Gay expressed that opening the store feels like \u201ccoming home.\u201d\n\nWhen Badcock Furniture closed its doors, there was concern that Statesboro would lose a valuable, trusted furniture vendor. Gibson McDonald stepped in at just the right time, ensuring that the community wouldn't miss out on quality furniture, appliances, and dedicated service. The transition was seamless, not just in business operations but in preserving the relationships built over the years.\n\nWhile the name on the sign has changed, familiar faces remain inside. Gibson McDonald was fortunate to have the entire Badcock staff join their team, ensuring continuity for customers. Leading the way is Judy Brown, who has managed the store for 23 years, along with the same sales team that Statesboro residents have trusted over the years.\n\nJudy and Amber Brown\n\nJudy Brown, thrilled with the seamless transition between businesses, expressed her gratitude for the opportunity to continue serving the community alongside her dedicated team. \"We didn't miss a day of work,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThey weren't interested in getting rid of employees at all.\u201d\n\nThis stability has been a cornerstone of maintaining strong relationships with customers who rely on familiar faces and trusted service.\n\n\u201cAll of the customers that come visit us will be greeted by the same familiar faces that they are used to when it was Badcock Home Furniture & More,\u201d Gay noted. This seamless transition keeps the community connected while introducing the Gibson-McDonald brand.\n\nOne standout feature that Gibson McDonald brings to Statesboro is its in-house financing. Unlike larger chains, Gibson McDonald offers flexible financing backed by their own credit department, allowing them to work closely with customers and provide personalized support.\n\n\u201cIt allows us to create strong, one-on-one relationships with our customers,\u201d Gay said. \u201cWe pride ourselves on working with people, especially when times get tough.\u201d\n\nIn fact, in-house financing is the cornerstone of Gibson McDonald's business model. It provides the company with the flexibility to offer customized financial solutions tailored to individual needs, helping customers access quality furniture, appliances, and electronics without the typical red tape. This approach fosters long-term relationships, as Gibson McDonald is able to support customers through various life circumstances, offering understanding and assistance beyond a simple transaction.\n\nGibson McDonald isn\u2019t just another furniture store; it\u2019s a company that prides itself on serving small towns and supporting local businesses. Their business model is rooted in community connections, valuing relationships over transactions. This philosophy has allowed them to thrive since 1934, growing alongside the communities they serve.\n\nThe product line remains similar to what customers were familiar with at Badcock, including a wide range of furniture, appliances, and electronics. However, the personal touch of a family-owned business sets Gibson McDonald apart, offering both familiarity and fresh opportunities for the community.\n\nMark Gibson, one of the owners, stated that they were \"happy and excited to be here,\" reflecting the company\u2019s enthusiasm about becoming part of the Statesboro community. Gay also highlighted the company\u2019s interest in being part of the narrative that focuses not on businesses that closed in 2024, but on those that found new life.",

It requests that McDonald\u2019s \u2018disclose an assessment of whether its current climate transition plans and related resource commitments can reasonably achieve its 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets, or whether additional plans or commitments are necessary.\u2019\n\nThe proponent recommends that this assessment include:\n\n\u2018Quantifying the emissions reduction impact of each of McDonald\u2019s current climate strategies\n\n\u2018Assessing whether [the company\u2019s] livestock dependency makes its climate targets unachievable\n\n\u2018Integrating quantitative, timebound protein diversification targets.\u2019\n\n\u2018McDonald\u2019s business is dependent on livestock, with beef accounting for about one third of [the company\u2019s] total [greenhouse gas (GHG)] emissions,\u2019 Green Century writes. \u2018Although McDonald\u2019s is committed to reducing Scope 3 emissions, which comprise 99 percent of its GHG footprint, by 50.4 percent by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050, it has not disclosed a roadmap for achieving these targets.\u2019\n\nAccording to Green Century, this omission exposes McDonald\u2019s to \u2018material\u2019 supply chain, competitive and legal risks. For example, it states that \u2018alternative proteins [ie plant-based and food-technology products] offer the highest emissions savings per dollar of invested capital of any industry, and competitors including Burger King offer alternative proteins in every US restaurant. Nevertheless, alternative proteins are absent from McDonald\u2019s public US climate strategy.\u2019\n\n\u2018Micromanagement\u2019\n\nIn its letter to the SEC, McDonald\u2019s argues that it should be given no-action relief to omit the proposal per Rule 14a-8(i)(7) because it deals with matters related to the company\u2019s ordinary business operations by looking to micromanage the company. It does this by requesting a \u2018highly prescriptive and detailed assessment that will require the company to gather, analyze and report on a significant range of internal and external information,\u2019 McDonald\u2019s argues.\n\nThe proposal also tries to micromanage the company by \u2018limiting management\u2019s discretion regarding the establishment, measurement and fulfillment of the company\u2019s emissions reduction targets, regardless of changing regulations, market conditions, business strategy or other circumstances,\u2019 McDonald\u2019s writes.\n\nIt adds: \u2018The board has determined the appropriate path toward managing the company\u2019s emission targets [and its] strategies are publicly disclosed on its website. [McDonald\u2019s] approach reflects guidance and input from across the company\u2019s various specialized departments, as well as outside experts. The company, rather than shareholders, is best equipped to consider, understand and address the nuances and complexities of its emissions targets.\u2019\n\nMcDonald\u2019s also argues that the proposal\u2019s references to policy issues such as climate change and climate risk does not preclude it from being excluded per Rule 14a-8(i)(7).\n\nMcDonald\u2019s filed its 2024 proxy statement on March 20 ahead of its AGM on May 22. The company did not respond immediately to a request for comment.",

            "content": "The year for McDonald\u2019s began as the company hinted it would\u2014with something we hadn\u2019t seen in nearly six calendars. The McValue platform, which arrived in early January, marked the first time in well over five years the brand showcased a unified value platform message across the U.S. It\u2019s a push that began the previous spring when McDonald\u2019s $5 Meal Deal was announced to counter an increasingly soft spending climate, namely at the lower-income level of the chain\u2019s traffic base.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s leading up to 2024 appreciated steady top-line expansion on price (30 percent same-store sales growth from 2019 to then), like other chains, but faced negative guest counts that reached a head as guests began to cut back visits amid ongoing inflation. McDonald\u2019s benefited from the top trading down. Higher-income customers left other categories, as did middle-income ones. Eventually, it brought diners into McDonald\u2019s who might not have shown up when pricing wasn\u2019t so widely sensitive. However, as hikes sustained, and macro conditions remained stressed, restaurants began to compete for fewer consumers who were visiting less frequently. And that led to the \u201cstreet-fighting mentality,\u201d CFO Ian Borden referenced last April.\n\nSo McDonald\u2019s began to work toward reinforcing its value strength by seeking an everyday pillar it could put national marketing dollars behind instead of a local approach. The $5 Meal Deal arrived in late June, had some positives and less positives, but did accomplish its goal of retrenching McDonald\u2019s place among value seekers. It went from a limited run into an extended one, and to the doorstep of the holistic McValue Platform, which houses all of the burger chain\u2019s value offers in one place, including meal offers\u2014like the current $5 Meal Deal\u2014in-app promotions, local food and drink specials, and a new Buy One, Add One for $1 offer at breakfast and lunch/dinner. Some notable in-app offers include medium fries with a $1 purchase every Friday in 2025 and a free McCrispy chicken sandwich for new app users.\n\nMORE ON MCDONALD\u2019S\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Beverage Spinoff CosMc\u2019s to Focus on Compact, Digitally Focused Designs\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Rolls Back Some DEI Initiatives\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Opens Another Drive-Thru and Digital Focused Prototype\n\nUnsurprisingly, McDonald\u2019s wasn\u2019t alone in elevating value in 2025: Subway released a $6.99 6-inch deal; Taco Bell rolled out $5, $7, and $9 Luxe Cravings Boxes, Dunkin\u2019 got into the $5 game, and on this battle went.\n\nLike any example in fast-food history, steep discounts often prove to be a trial driver. Yet what\u2019s the next step?\n\nBTIG analyst Peter Saleh recently conducted a series of franchise checks at McDonald\u2019s to take stock of these latest moves. As expected, he said, operators suggested Q4 2024 and Q1 2025 same-store sales, so far, have been tepid, owing to the brand\u2019s food-safety incident in late October ($100 million went toward the recovery effort), cold January weather, and varied sales recovery.\n\nFranchisees said they saw solid momentum in the first half of October on the heels of the Chicken Big Mac, with comps in the mid-single-digit range, before observing a 17\u201320 percent impact from the E. coli news on the 22nd. Since, reports have been mixed (South and Southeast took snow-laced hits they normally don\u2019t). Some operators told Saleh they returned to the mid-single digits by December. Others stayed negative. One notable takeaway across\u2014a high percent of sales on discount. The McValue platform, $5 Meal Deal, and app/loyalty discounts, Saleh said, were accounting for more than a third of sales, according to some franchisees\u2014three times the company\u2019s historical mix, \u201cand the highest we can recall.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe McDonald\u2019s is over-indexing to value, as the discount mix is roughly 3X the historical average of low-teens,\u201d Saleh wrote in a note. \u201cIn fact, some franchisees indicated that food costs as a percent of sales have not been this high in 6\u20137 years, implying margin pressure on their restaurants. Several franchisees raised prices on the BOGO items before the deal went into effect to protect margins.\u201d\n\nSaleh, in turn, reduced his Q4 2024 (will be reported February 10) and Q1 2025 U.S. same-store sales estimates from 2 and 1.5 percent, respectively, to 0.5 percent (same-store sales rose 0.3 percent in Q3 2024 on average check growth offset by slightly negative traffic; that quarter did not account for the E. coli outbreak).\n\nFranchisees said plunging temperatures and winter weather to start 2025 dampened performance, especially at breakfast, even with McValue factored in.\n\nJust from a logistics standpoint, McDonald\u2019s February will be a day shorter (no Leap Year) this go-around, resulting in a 350-basis-point hit for the month and 110 basis points for the quarter, and Saleh said menu news of late has been light, partially owing to the food safety incident. Checks did, though, hint the McRib performed well in December and chicken tenders are potentially planned for late-April, followed by the much-anticipated return of Snack Wraps over the summer\u2014a product that left most U.S. menus in 2016, with some restaurants keeping them on through 2020. Introduced in 2006 and priced at $1.29, it\u2019s likely the Snack Wrap not only gives McDonald\u2019s another marketing piece with strong nostalgic pull, but one that can provide a consistent value entry point, either as an add-on or a menu item with ladder-up potential. It\u2019s still available in other parts of the world. The Canadian side of McDonald\u2019s launched a refreshed McWrap and Chicken Snack Wrap lineup in June 2023, including Zesty Lime, Sweet Chili, Chicken & Bacon, Spicy Buffalo Chicken, and Ranch Chicken. They\u2019re available in the U.K., too.\n\nBeyond value, this launch also amplifies a chicken platform McDonald\u2019s said in July had reached parity with beef sales. CEO Chris Kempczinski noted the category is twice the size of beef globally, and growing at a faster rate. The McCrispy Chicken Sandwich itself is a $1 billion brand across several markets.\n\nThe Snack Wrap will also directly compete with Burger King\u2019s Royal Crispy Wraps, which debuted in August 2023 at $2.99 each.\n\nReturning to present trends, however, Saleh said weaker sales in January (weather) made it difficult to assess the McValue platform\u2019s broad performance to date. While it\u2019s generating sales, he said, franchisees indicated there was too much noise in recent weeks to present a verdict.\n\nStill, conversations note the BOGO is a mid-teens percent of mix, while the $5 Meal Deal is still in the low double-digits, placing the total discount block north of 30 percent, as mentioned, when including existing app/loyalty discounts (mid-single digits).\n\nSaleh feels the challenge awaiting McDonald\u2019s in the months and quarters ahead will be weening customers off deep discounts. The chicken tenders and wraps are expected to roll out at full price, suggesting the brand\u2019s heavy advertising push toward deals will continue for at least 2\u20133 more months. The $5 Meal Deal is approved through July and could get extended further (as it has before). \u201cWe heard a few markets have already extended the deal through year-end,\u201d Saleh said.\n\nLargely, franchisee sentiment has rode a rollercoaster over the past several years, Saleh said. It improved when McDonald\u2019s backed off the PACE (Performance and Customer Excellence) requirements that hung a strict grading system over franchisees. Operators said market conditions, inflation, rising prices, and staffing made it difficult to correctly measure to stringent standards, store to store. Units were scheduled to receive between six and 10 visits from corporate and third-party assessors\u2014beyond normal inspection cadences for local food safety and codes officials.\n\nSaleh said sentiment deteriorated more recently as comps struggled and the food safety concerns arose. Two weeks ago, more than 400 owner/operators met in Denver, he said, to discuss these issues without inviting corporate to the meeting.\n\nHe claims several franchisees believe McDonald\u2019s cost-cutting efforts under the Accelerating the Arches plan was to blame for the food safety incident, as McDonald\u2019s previously had a manager for just about every major supplier, overseeing product and processes. \u201cUnder the new scheme,\u201d Saleh said, \u201cmany of those positions have been eliminated in favor of supplier or third-party oversight, under the guide of \u2018self-managed excellence.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to determine if this food safety issue could have been avoided with greater oversight,\u201d he continued. \u201cFranchisees couldn\u2019t definitively say so, but noted it has been several decades since the system had a major food safety incident.\u201d\n\nQSR magazine reached out to McDonald\u2019s corporate for comment on the claims but had not heard back as of press time.\n\nA fresh theme Saleh heard was concern about the performance of new units and the high cannibalization rate of existing sales. Some operators, he said, shared new units were generating sales of $250,000\u2013$1 million below McDonald\u2019s forecasts. \u201cSo while these units are still profitable, they are not meeting projections,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cFranchisees also noted that new locations are cannibalizing existing unit sales by upward of 20 percent. This suggests that the faster pace of development in the U.S. will be a greater drag on same-store sales, and bears watching as McDonald\u2019s aims to accelerate the pace of new store openings.\u201d\n\nOn that latter point, as a refresher, McDonald\u2019s in December 2023, laid out a plan to reach 50,000 locations by 2027.\n\nOn a different topic, Saleh added he\u2019s yet to find a franchisee or executive concerned about the change in immigration policy and the impact it could have on labor available and/or wage rates. This was true, he said, throughout the ICR Conference in Orlando. Operators and C-suite executives alike claimed to hire only documented, legal labor, and therefore don\u2019t believe any change in policy would impact their ability to hire. \u201cWhile we appreciate that perspective, we remain concerned that any restrictions on immigration could impact hourly labor for independent restaurants and other industries, shrinking the labor pool and driving wage rates higher in an already tight market,\u201d Saleh said.",

The two unite in-person after a video call, with O\u2019Grimacey announcing the Shamrock Shake is back as part of their reunion.\n\nStarting Tuesday, fans can browse limited-edition O\u2019Grimacey merchandise, including shirts, pins and hats, on McDonald\u2019s webstore. The fast food chain continues to lean on nostalgia for its characters amidst a marketing leadership shakeup.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is reaching deeper into the well of vintage intellectual property in dusting off Uncle O\u2019Grimacey, an Irish relative of Grimace outfitted in green fur and a matching hat and vest who first debuted in the mid-70s but has not made a major appearance in decades.\n\nThe revival of the avuncular icon is part of the Golden Arches owner\u2019s renewed focus on its fictional McDonaldland universe that has served as fodder for marketing efforts that place a heavy emphasis on millennial nostalgia. Other characters that have recently received the spotlight include the Hamburglar, McNugget Buddies and Grimace himself, with some of those promotions becoming viral phenomena.\n\nO\u2019Grimacey\u2019s arrival back in the states is timed to the return of the Shamrock Shake, a fan-favorite seasonal menu offering that features mint-green syrup and an Irish theme. McDonald\u2019s is also celebrating 50 years of partnership with Ronald McDonald House Charities and will donate 25 cents of every Shamrock Shake sold at participating restaurant locations from Feb. 10 to March 23.\n\nThe family theme extends to McDonald\u2019s tie-up with Ancestry, which appears in new social media content as Grimace delves deeper into his roots. In addition, McDonald\u2019s is posting videos that show company archivist Mike Bullington as he\u2019s quizzed on Shamrock Shake lore. Weber Shandwick, Bodega, Boden and TSMGI are some of the agencies behind the push.\n\nPrior mascot-oriented promotions, like one centered on Grimace\u2019s birthday, helped boost McDonald\u2019s sales and shore up internet cachet. But the company is coming off a challenging period that saw a public health crisis and consumers seeking greater value.\n\nLast year, McDonald\u2019s posted its first decline in comparable sales, a key metric of restaurant health, since the start of the pandemic. U.S. same-stores sales increased just 0.3% during Q3 2024, but a revamped value lineup has appeared to gain traction and received heavier marketing support with a campaign starring John Cena. McDonald\u2019s reports its Q4 earnings Feb. 10.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has also undergone a marketing leadership shuffle this year, with U.S. Chief Marketing and Customer Experience Officer Tariq Hassan announcing plans to step down. Alyssa Buetikofer, currently marketing chief of McDonald\u2019s Canada, will assume Hassan\u2019s role on Feb. 15. Hassan, who joined the brand in September 2021 from Petco, has spearheaded much of McDonald\u2019s nostalgic-fueled marketing of late, including the release of adult Happy Meals and the Grimace birthday bonanza.",

After decades in the background, he\u2019s \u201cpacked his bags\u201d to reunite with his nephew Grimace to celebrate the return of the popular treat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Gonda, McDonald\u2019s chief impact officer, explained that this year, the company is bringing back its original fundraiser with the Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC). For every Shamrock Shakes sold at participating locations, McDonald\u2019s will donate 25 cents to RMHC. The goal is to raise $5 million to support families with seriously ill children staying at RMHC facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Shamrock Shake has been part of McDonald\u2019s menu for over five decades, and typically makes its return leading up to St. Patrick\u2019s Day. The return of Uncle O\u2019Grimacey is part of McDonald\u2019s strategy to tape into nostalgia. Chains like Taco Bell (YUM+1.23% ) have also taken a similar approach, bringing back classics that were once popular menu items.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe promotion also fits with McDonald\u2019s ongoing use of classic characters. Grimace has seen a resurgence in popularity after his viral birthday meal campaign, while Hamburglar\u2019s tour across the U.S. to promote the chain\u2019s revamped burgers has also drawn attention.\n\nThe timing of the Shamrock Shake promotion is critical, as McDonald\u2019s continues to recover from the aftermath of an E. Coli outbreak linked to its Quarter Pounders last October. Although the promotion may not impact earnings in the near term, McDonald\u2019s is hoping that nostalgia and its charitable tie-in will help drive traffic and boost sales. In August 2024, its collector\u2019s cup meals proved so successful they started selling for up to $100 a cup on third-party websites like eBay (EBAY+1.92% ) .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with the Shamrock Shake, McDonald\u2019s is still offering other value promotions like the $5 meal deal and its McValue menu as it aims to attract budget-conscious consumers. In November 2024, it said it was bringing back its cult classic McRib for a limited time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company is set to report earnings on Feb. 10 before the bell, coinciding with the Shamrock Shake launch. While the promotion won\u2019t directly affect those results, it could provide momentum McDonald\u2019s needs to stay competitive in the crowded fast food market.",

Cheddar\n\nMcDonald's has brought it back.\n\nNo, we're not talking about the McRib. If you missed it in December, you'll have to wait.\n\nThe fast-food giant returned the Shamrock Shake and Oreo Shamrock McFlurry on Tuesday.\n\nWhat is a Shamrock Shake at McDonald's?\n\nThe Shamrock Shake is a milkshake made with vanilla soft-serve ice cream, artificially flavored minty green syrup and whipped topping. McDonald's debuted the first Shamrock Shake in 1970, and the cult classic has been returning to the menu around St. Patrick's Day each year since.\n\nWhat is the Oreo Shamrock McFlurry?\n\nThe Oreo Shamrock McFlurry debuted in 2020 to celebrate the Shamrock Shake's 50th anniversary. The seasonal dessert is made with vanilla soft-service ice cream, artificially flavored mint green syrup and Oreo cookie pieces.\n\nHow does the Oreo McFlurry taste?\n\nYou wouldn't think McDonald's would have a top-flight fast food dessert, but you would be sadly mistaken. Rereleased three weeks before Wendy's releases its Thin Mint Frosty, McDonald's has planted its flag as one of the best mint-cookie desserts.\n\nWhen you get it, it will look like the perfect dessert to promote the movie Wicked with the green and black. The best thing you can do is stir it up like a fruit-at-the-bottom yogurt. The McFlurry machine doesn't always mix the ingredients well. Once mixed, the Oreo pieces mixed with the soft serve and mint produce a near-perfect facsimile of the Girl Scouts Thin Mint flavor. It has a good cookie crunch and the flavors blend. There isn't one overwhelming taste. The flavor is better than the Dairy Queen Mint Oreo Blizzard.\n\nOne final suggestion, the small is the perfect size. It's not too much and leaves you more than satisfied and less guilty.\n\nHow does the Shamrock Shake taste?\n\nThe Shamrock Shake is like drinking green beer on St. Partick's Day. It looks different than normal beer, but there's no real difference. The shake looked different than a vanilla shake, but there wasn't much of a difference in taste. It paled in comparison to the Oreo Shamrock McFlurry.\n\nIt could have been because this was the first Shamrock Shake of the season made at this McDonald's. Still, it tasted like a vanilla shake with a hint of mint.\n\nThe shake pales in comparison with the Grimace Birthday Shake of 2023 or the old Egg Nog shake that used to come out at Christmas \u2013 and has been on my Christmas list since McDonald's dropped it.\n\nThe Shamrock Shake is still a traditional item, but like other nostalgic items at McDonald's, it doesn't live up to your memories.\n\nMcDonald's near me in Delaware\n\n1401 Governors Place, Bear\n\n1 Addy Road, Bethany Beach\n\n18733 Sussex Highway, Bridgeville\n\n60 East St., Camden\n\n2702 Philadelphia Pike, Claymont\n\n38667 Sussex Highway, Delmar\n\n1788N N.

The ruling from Students For Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College was cited as one of the reasons McDonald\u2019s modified some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion practices last month. The company noted in a statement that its priority is to \u201cbe a responsible business, acting lawfully and being responsive to the business environment.\u201d\n\nWith the HACER settlement, McDonald\u2019s states that it disagrees with the lawsuit\u2019s claim that the program is discriminatory. However, the chain said a legal challenge would mean this year\u2019s applicants would not have the opportunity to compete for the scholarship funds.\n\n\u201c\u2026 As we explored the path forward, we focused on two clear goals. First: ensure that applicants for this year\u2019s scholarship funds do not lose out on the opportunity to receive awards that will help them pursue their educational aspirations. There are more than 3,000 students who have completed their application for the HACER scholarship, hoping to receive money to start school this fall,\u201d the company posted on its website. \u201cThe second goal: safeguard HACER, which has been a deeply important program that has existed for nearly 40 years and has been instrumental in creating educational opportunities for Hispanic students pursuing higher education.\u201d\n\nRelated:Starbucks offers first look at new coffeehouse store designs\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said it held discussions with franchisees, community leaders and organizations, educational leaders, past HACER recipients, and employees to conclude that settling the lawsuit and evolving the program is \u201cthe right thing to do for its recipients.\u201d\n\nAs part of that evolution, McDonald\u2019s will remove the criteria that at least one parent be of Hispanic/Latino heritage. Instead, applicants must demonstrate their impact and contribution to the Hispanic/Latino community through their activities, leadership, and service.\n\nThe HACER National Scholarship was established in 1985 by owner/operator Richard Castro to assist Hispanic students as they pursue their higher education goals. To date, more than $33 million in scholarships have been awarded to more than 17,000 recipients.\n\nRelated:Starbucks changes, Noodles\u2019 menu, Wonder\n\nContact Alicia Kelso at [email protected]",

That same month, McDonald\u2019s announced it would roll back its diversity goals, joining other major companies like Moline-based John Deere and Walmart.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s on Friday said it disagreed with AAER\u2019s claim but will settle the lawsuit. There was no financial exchange as part of the settlement, nor any admission of wrongdoing by McDonald\u2019s, according to the company.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s \u201cwill remove the criteria for at least one parent to be of Hispanic/Latino heritage,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cInstead, applicants must demonstrate their impact and contribution to the Hispanic/Latino community through their activities, leadership and service.\u201d\n\nAAER\u2019s legal challenge would have placed 2025 applications and scholarships on hold. McDonald\u2019s said \u201csettling this lawsuit and evolving the program is the right thing to do for its recipients.\u201d\n\nDuring a virtual media briefing on Friday, a McDonald\u2019s spokesperson said, \u201cThere are kids counting on this money now.\u201d\n\nAAER President Edward Blum previously formed Students for Fair Admissions, which filed lawsuits that led to the U.S. Supreme Court ending affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s announcement comes a week after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to eliminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which he and conservatives have said are discriminatory.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said more than 3,000 students had applied so far for this year\u2019s HACER scholarship. The original Feb. 6 deadline will be extended to Mar. 6 to accommodate the change in application criteria. Scholarship winners will be announced this spring.\n\nThe HACER program, started in 1985, previously awarded 30 college scholarships worth up to $100,000 each year to students with at least one parent of Hispanic/Latino heritage, among other criteria.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said changing the program\u2019s criteria will \u201csafeguard HACER, which has been a deeply important program that has existed for nearly 40 years and has been instrumental in creating educational opportunities for Hispanic students pursuing higher education.\u201d\n\nSince its inception, more than $33 million in scholarships have been awarded to more than 17,000 students, according to McDonald\u2019s.\n\nFor its other education scholarships, McDonald\u2019s will \u201ccontinue to evaluate and look at programs and evolve them where it makes sense,\u201d said a spokesperson.\n\nThe fast food chain doesn\u2019t expect legal challenges to its Black & Positively Golden Scholarship Program with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. That scholarship is for students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities and does not focus on applicants\u2019 identity, said a spokesperson.\n\nA McDonald\u2019s fact sheet said its overall \u201cposition and our commitment to inclusion is steadfast.\u201d But the fact sheet added, \u201cAs part of our ongoing inclusion efforts, our work is evolving.\u201d",

            "content": "Though these breakfast tacos are delicious, they may be difficult to assemble and consume, especially within the confines of a car or at a McDonald's tabletop. For starters (and in accordance with the viral hack), you want to place the hotcake shells in the plastic container lid that comes with a Big Breakfast; place them in a row, folded as you would a taco shell for further stability. In terms of stacking your filling, you can choose your own order, though it may be helpful to start with a sturdy layer of sliced sausage patty before adding eggs and hash browns.\n\nAs for the syrup (or ketchup), you can either pour it on top of your tacos or dip the tacos into your choice of sauce. For the most even sauce coverage, pouring the sauce over may be the best bet, but dipping may be the way to go if you're after a less sticky bite. After all, dipping your tacos can prevent syrup leaking out when eating your impromptu taco breakfast.\n\nWhat to do with that extra biscuit and butter? Well, that's up to you; you could double the bread by crumbling your biscuits atop your taco crouton-style, or you could simply leave it for after a post-breakfast nap. There's really no going wrong with this nifty McDonald's hack. Plus, if this pancake taco isn't your thing, you can always make your own hash brown sandwich; just don't expect McDonald's to put it on the menu any time soon.",

She was the sister of the late Malcolm and Laurence Fraser. She was also the grandmother of Aidan, Sean Jr., and Nicholas Kilroy, and Mitchell Rodriguez. In addition, Carol is also survived by her brother-in-law Michael and wife Carol, sister-in-law Elizabeth, brother-in-law Robert, and several loving nieces, nephews and cousins.\n\nOne of Carol\u2019s passions was that she loved tracing her heritage on Ancestry. She would go to cemeteries tracing headstones. Carol loved traveling and enjoying time with family and friends, all of whom will miss her friendship, compassion and strength of character. Carol was the glue that held her family together and was a friend who could be counted on. Even after suffering the loss of her beloved daughter and husband, she always kept a positive attitude, counseling others: \u201cBe grateful and concentrate on the time you had with your loved ones, rather than dwelling on their loss.\u201d\n\nThose who knew Carol are grateful for the time they had with her.\n\nVisitation for relatives and friends will be held at the McDonald Funeral Home, 19 Yale Ave., Wakefield on Monday February 17th, 2025, from 2-5 p.m. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that you donate to a charity of your choice in her name.\n\nHer funeral service will be held at St. Paul\u2019s Episcopal Church, Summer St., Lynnfield on Tuesday February 18th, 2025, at 10:30 a.m.\n\nInterment, Forest Hill Cemetery, Lynnfield at a later date.\n\n\n\n",

Cheddar\n\nThis marks the first time since 1999 that a single franchisee owns all of the McDonald's restaurants in Springfield.\n\nSpringfield's lone Quiznos is under new ownership.\n\nGreenie's Grill Food Truck opens brick-and-mortar location in Rochester.\n\nAll of the McDonald's restaurants in Springfield are soon to be owned by the same man.\n\nAs of Feb. 1, Mike Kasprzyk will own all 11 Golden Arches in the Capital City after purchasing two stores from to other franchise operators, Dr. Paul and Mary Breznay and Kim Derringer, in December.\n\nThe back-to-back acquisitions doubled Kasprzyk\u2019s Springfield footprint after only entering the market last year.\n\n\u201cI stand on the shoulders of giants. A lot of great families before us,\u201d said Kasprzyk, sole owner of the newly christened Capital City McDonalds franchise. He is only the third to capture the entire market since the first McDonald\u2019s opened in Springfield in 1957.\n\n\u201cIt all happened rather quick, organically. The other owners were looking to retire or relocate.\u201d\n\nThe Springfield resident said the size and scale possible with a single franchise operator will translate to more consistent customer service and more opportunities for staff.\n\nKasprzyk bought his first McDonald\u2019s franchise in 2015, but didn\u2019t dip his toes into the local market until January 2024 when Brad Davis retired, selling his six Springfield locations.\n\nThe Springfield market has been carved up among several, frequently rotating franchisees for the past 26 years. But that doesn\u2019t reflect the chain\u2019s longer history in the Capital City.\n\nJohn Mack introduced Springfield diners to the brand in 1957\u2014a decade before the chain\u2019s signature sandwich, the Big Mac, debuted. Mack and his children had sole franchise rights for the market until selling to the McGraw family in 1989.\n\nMcGraw Enterprises held Springfield\u2019s McDonald monopoly for a decade before selling two locations to former employees in 1999. A year later they sold four west side holdings, including the Chatham location, to Kasprzyk\u2019s parents, Joe and Revella, who already had been running the McDonald\u2019s in Jacksonville for a decade.\n\nThe senior Kasprzyk\u2019s have since retired. Their son Mike now owns the Jacksonville store, as well as locations in Chatham, Beardstown, Havana and Mt. Sterling.\n\nThe headquarters for Capital City McDonalds will be in Jacksonville.\n\nNew cafe opens\n\nJava Junction opened Tuesday in White Oaks Mall\u2019s center court.\n\nThe new cafe, located in the footprint of the former Gloria Jean\u2019s Coffee, features grilled wraps, sandwiches and soups, as well as a breakfast menu. The beverage selection includes a full line of espressos and other hot and cold caffeinated drinks.\n\nTable and counter seating available. Operating hours are 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday and noon to 6 p.m. Sunday. However, orders can be filled as early at 7:30 a.m. on weekdays via online or phone orders and delivered curbside outside the mall entrance just west of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods\n\nPhone: 217-572-1237.\n\nDalton Ingram is the sole owner of Java Junction.\n\nPermanent lunch menu\n\nWednesday lunch hours are now a permanent offering at Bloom Wine Bar & Floral after a successful test run for the downtown establishment in December.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of repeat customers, a lot of positive reviews, surrounding chatter for us to decide it was worth our time,\u201d said Brittney Robinson, who co-owns the business at 2 S. Old State Capitol Plaza with partners Caitlin Becker and Hannah Goss.\n\nThe lunch menu includes soups, sandwiches and salads, as well as Bloom\u2019s standing nibbles of flatbreads, dips and charcuterie spreads. The lunch menu is available Wednesdays and Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Dine in, take out available. Reservations recommended via Bloom\u2019s website at www.bloomspringfield.com. Phone: 217/679-1830.\n\nNew ownership\n\nNew ownership at Springfield\u2019s sole standalone Quiznos is taking the sandwich shop in a different direction. Literally.\n\nSamantha Clardy has purchased the toasted sandwich shop at 2701 W. Lawrence Ave. from her former bosses, Matt and Toni Hurt. The Hurts continue to operate the Denver-based chain on the Lincoln Land Community College campus.\n\nClardy said the only change customers will notice at the Lawrence Avenue locale is a new traffic flow. Patrons will begin placing orders at the cash register and then proceed to have their custom orders made.\n\nThe Hurts opened the Lawrence Avenue sandwich chain location in 2004 before opening a satellite site on LLCC\u2019s main campus in 2018.\n\nNew brick-and-mortar location\n\nFans of Greenie\u2019s Grill Food Truck no longer have to wait for better weather to enjoy their favorite smashburgers.\n\nOperators Adam Greenfield and Kayla Webster opened a brick-and-mortar location, Greenie\u2019s Grill Rochester, Jan. 25 in a footprint carved out of the former Rochester IGA building.\n\n\u201c(The food truck) was going well. As it took off, we realized a store front would be crucial for this business model to be sustained year round,\u201d Greenfield said.\n\nGreenie\u2019s Grill Rochester has an open kitchen format with food cooked to order while customers watch.\n\nThe menu highlights a variety of smashburgers made with fresh ground beef from Humphrey\u2019s Market. Other selections include cheese steaks, sandwiches, wraps, horseshoes and appetizers.\n\nHours are 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. The quick service, carry out establishment has limited seating but is located next to The Back 9 bar and golf course simulator. Phone: 217-498-1038.\n\nGreenie\u2019s Grill Food Truck will continue to accept bookings for events only.\n\nThe A La Carte column highlights restaurant openings, closings, renovations and relocations, as well as personnel changes and business news.

However, the hostel website noted that it was moved to another display at the Snotra House, a hostel in \u00deykkvib\u00e6r, Iceland. Snopes contacted Snotra House for further information about the meal, including whether it was still there.\n\nSnotra House owner Siggi Sigurdur told Snopes in an email that \"the burger is still alive and kicking,\" so to speak. At the time of this writing, Siggi said the burger was still housed at Snotra House and \"will be there in the future.\"\n\n\"We are preparing a new live stream that will hopefully be ready within weeks,\" wrote Siggi.\n\nSnopes asked for updated photos of the burger and fries and a link to the livestream once it is running. We will update this article accordingly.\n\nThe Iceland Review reported in 2019 that the last McDonald's burger sold in Iceland was bought in 2009 by Hj\u00f6rtur Sm\u00e1rason.\n\nIn 2009, three of the McDonald's restaurant locations operating in Iceland closed because the country's financial crisis made it too expensive to operate the franchise, reported BBC at the time. The online Icelandic newspaper Visir.is reported that the company Lyst, which owned the franchise at the time, had to \"buy supplies abroad due to McDonald's specific standards.\"\n\nIn a Google-translated article, Visir.is reported that Lyst had published at the time the below statement, in part:\n\nLyst ehf. will end its partnership with the McDonald's fast food chain at the end of the month, but the company operates three restaurants under a franchise from McDonald's. The locations will continue to operate under the name Metro. The Metro locations will continue to offer similar products and a similar menu at comparable prices. The emphasis will be on Icelandic ingredients, quality and speed of service as before. The change is made in good agreement with McDonald's. The reason for the change is the difficult economic environment in this country. The collapse of the Icelandic kr\u00f3na is the main factor. In recent years, Lyst ehf. has purchased most of the ingredients for McDonald's dishes, meat, cheese, vegetables and other supplies from foreign suppliers, according to McDonald's requirements and standards. The collapse of the exchange rate, together with high tariffs on imported agricultural products, has doubled the company's raw material costs and made the results difficult. The parties do not believe that the economic conditions here will improve sufficiently for the operation of restaurants under the McDonald's brand to be profitable in the long term.\n\n[...] Starting Sunday, November 1, Metro customers will be able to enjoy a similar menu to that at McDonald's locations. Children's boxes with fun toys will be in place. Strict quality control, fast service and low prices will continue to be the focus. This will be based on the experience that Lyst ehf. has from its long and successful collaboration with McDonald's. In the first few weeks, customers will also be aware of innovations, such as an increased emphasis on salads and other healthy foods.\n\nSome social media posts point to the meal's lack of decay as being due to preservatives used by McDonald's. Snopes contacted McDonald's for a comment.\n\nVarious factors can spoil food, writes the U.S. Department of Agriculture on its website. These might include light, oxygen, heat, humidity, and exposure to bacteria, gradually causing food to deteriorate over time. Depending on the conditions in which the meal is being held, decay or deterioration might be prevented much like, for example, sealed food in a can or freezer can be preserved for years.",

Holley. Sign up here.\n\nHolley, of Wawayanda, is accused of killing Megan McDonald in 2003. He had a prior romantic relationship with McDonald, who was 20 when she was killed. The case was considered one of Orange County\u2019s highest-profile cold cases until State Police arrested Holley and charged him with murder in April 2023. A grand jury indicted him last January after special prosecutors took over the case.\n\nHolley\u2019s court case has been focused on the Huntley hearing since September. It was the first major public proceeding where the public heard Holley speak about what he believed happened to McDonald.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDuring the evidentiary portion, which concluded in late November, the court reviewed hours of video of four interviews Holley had with investigators at State Police Troop F headquarters in Wallkill. The first of those, in 2003, began when Holley went to police on his own to discuss McDonald\u2019s murder. The second occurred in 2008 when investigators went to his home to speak about the ongoing investigation. The others began after unrelated incidents.\n\nIn all four interviews, Holley said he was not involved with McDonald\u2019s murder but took questions from investigators about what may have happened. Members of the State Police who spoke with Holley also testified at the Huntley hearing.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThough the court reviewed four of Holley\u2019s interviews, his defense team later withdrew their requests to suppress two Holley gave in 2003 and 2021.

Cheddar\n\nThe Shamrock Shake debuted in 1970 and the Oreo Shamrock McFlurry debuted in 2020.\n\nMcDonald's Shamrock Shake typically returns to menus in February ahead of St. Patrick's Day.\n\nA medium Shamrock Shake has 540 calories, and a regular Oreo Shamrock McFlurry has 460 calories.\n\nThe season of the mint-flavored, green-tinted shake is nearly upon us.\n\nMcDonald's Shamrock Shake, a milkshake made with vanilla soft-serve ice cream, artificially flavored minty green syrup and whipped topping, is expected to return the fast food chain's menu soon.\n\nA release date may not be out yet, but here's what we know about the Shamrock Shake and when it was released in years past.\n\nWhen was the Shamrock Shake released last year?\n\nMcDonald's released the Shamrock Shake and the accompanying Oreo Shamrock McFlurry on Feb. 5 in 2024.\n\nLast year's debut was several weeks earlier than in previous years. In 2023, McDonald's released the milkshake on Feb. 20, and in 2022, it was Feb. 21. In 2021, it was Feb. 15.\n\nMcDonald's debuted the first Shamrock Shake in 1970 and the cult classic has been returning to the menu around St. Patrick's Day each year since.\n\nThe Oreo Shamrock McFlurry debuted in 2020 as a celebration of the Shamrock Shake's 50th anniversary. The seasonal dessert is made with vanilla soft-service ice cream, artificially flavored mint green syrup and Oreo cookie pieces.\n\nWill the Oreo Shamrock McFlurry be back this year?\n\nBecause McDonald's has yet to announce details about this year's Shamrock Shake, it has not been confirmed if the Oreo Shamrock McFlurry will be back to the menu. However, the dessert has accompanied the shake on the menu each year since its unveiling in 2020, so it's probably to safe to assume it will be back.\n\nHow many calories are in a Shamrock Shake?\n\nA medium Shamrock Shake contains 540 calories, according to McDonald's. This is comparison to the 570 calories in McDonald's medium vanilla shake and 650 calories in a medium chocolate shake.\n\nAs for the Oreo Shamrock McFlurry, the regular-sized dessert contains 460 calories, according to McDonald's.\n\n(This story was updated to fix a typo.)\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

            "content": "If you've ever found yourself standing in front of the McDonald's menu signage torn over two items, we have good news: You no longer have to decide between the two. The golden arched fast food joint quietly dropped a secret menu item that combines two of our favorite orders: McNuggets and a McDouble.\n\nNow, you're probably wondering, \"Isn't that just two classic entr\u00e9es? What makes it so special and secret?\" The Crunchy Double, which originally launched on menus in Australia, is a McDouble piled with McNuggets (yep, right on the sandwich) and drizzled with the chain's tangy BBQ sauce.\n\nRelated Story I Tried Taco Bell's New Dipping Burritos\n\nBeing that I'm A.) a dedicated journalist and B.) a McDonald's expert, I knew what I had to do\u2014and that, my friends, is try the Crunchy McDouble for myself. While it hasn't quite made it to U.S. stores in an official capacity, creating the customization is easy enough whether you're ordering IRL or through the mobile app. There's just a little assembly involved.\n\nI placed an order for the McDouble, four McNuggets, and added a side of BBQ sauce. The order was still under $10 even with a necessary large Diet Coke to wash it all down. After picking up my order and arriving home, it was time to bring the creation to life. I stacked three of the four McNuggets on top of the McDouble (the fourth nugget didn't fit, so I had a nice appetizer), drizzled the BBQ sauce, and sandwiched it all back together between buns. Then it was time for the first bite.\n\nI was nervous! Overwhelmed! The entire concept of a nugget stacked burger felt...dare I say it...crazy? I was worried that one would overpower the other or just not combine well together at all.\n\nI need not have worried. There was something so satisfying about the crunch of the crispy McNugget breading meeting with the juicy beef patties and melty cheese. It's truly the best of both worlds. The flavor wasn't overwhelming nor did one ingredient overpower the other. It simply satiated two cravings at once \u2014 each bite had an excellent balance of flavor and texture. Plus, if you're trying to hit your daily protein goal, that's 32 grams of it right there.\n\nWith that being said, it's definitely a heftier order than your average McDonald's entr\u00e9e. I'd typically go for a classic cheeseburger, and though I enjoyed this iteration, the Crunchy Double might be a little too much as an every visit type of meal, Sometimes, you still just want a cheeseburger or nuggets separately.\n\nTechnically, the sammie is being touted as an in-app only order, but you can just do what I did, and order the McDouble, McChicken, and BBQ sauce separately. Toss it all together and bam, it's done \u2014 and you can call yourself the chef.",

Photo Provided by Bryan Meyers Midland teen Brayden Meyers poses with two totes full of pull tabs during a weigh-in at the Ronald McDonald House in Cleveland. Photo Provided by Bryan Meyers\n\nMidland teen Brayden Meyers has accomplished one of the greatest feats of the Ronald McDonald House by joining the Collect-A-Million Club - and he\u2019s looking to do it again.\n\nSixteen-year-old Meyers has spent the last eight years collecting pull tabs off of pop cans, pet food cans, soup cans and more to donate to Ronald McDonald House Charities. In February 2024, he finally achieved the end goal - donating one million pull tabs and getting his name on the Collect-A-Million Club plaque at the Ronald McDonald House in Cleveland.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s kind of cool to see it rack up,\u201d said Brayden\u2019s mom, Kristi. \u201cAnd when we finally hit that mark, it was really exciting.\u201d\n\nWhile he wasn\u2019t able to stay at the Ronald McDonald House any time last year, in mid-January Meyers saw his name on the plaque for the first time when he underwent surgery at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nA majority of the names on the plaque are organizations, like Girl Scout troops, fraternities and schools. Meyers is the second individual to be named on the plaque in Cleveland, and the 20th individual in the club overall.\n\nRonald McDonald House Charities provides essential services - including housing - to families with children in need of healthcare. The charity has houses all over the eastern U.S., including three houses in Michigan.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe Meyers family began staying at the Ronald McDonald House in Cleveland eight years ago. Brayden began receiving care for autism, epilepsy and a rare genetic mutation at the Cleveland Clinic 11 years ago and visits the clinic two to three times a year.\n\nIn addition to providing lodging at the house, the charity also provides transportation, meals and entertainment, including tickets to the Natural History Museum, Cleveland Zoo and professional sporting events.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really good people,\u201d said Brayden\u2019s dad, Bryan. \u201cThey\u2019re very accommodating, they do everything they can for you.\u201d\n\nThe charity collects pull tabs as a fundraiser. About 1,000 pull tabs equates to one pound of aluminum, which the charity recycles in exchange for funds based on the price of aluminum.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe family decided to start the journey to one million tabs because of Brayden\u2019s interest and passion for it.\n\n\u201cHe likes doing it,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cWhen he\u2019s having a bad day, I\u2019ll hold the bag (of pull tabs) up and it kind of brightens his day.\u201d\n\nAlong with Brayden\u2019s passion for joining the Collect-a-Million Club, the family as a whole wanted to partake in the endeavor as a way to give back to the charity that has done so much for them.\n\n\u201cWe donate what we can monetarily, but it\u2019s an easy enough thing to do,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cThey help us out a lot, they help out other people a lot. We met people that have been there for years\u2026(The charity) doesn\u2019t ask for anything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThey have all the services and we\u2019ve used their services,\u201d Kristi added. \u201cI do the donation, of course, but if we can help out in this way and it\u2019s so simple, then we\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nBrayden\u2019s parents said they often find bags of pull tabs at their workplaces or on their front porch, left by people in the community who know about their son\u2019s endeavor.\n\n\u201cAny time there\u2019s a Facebook post that we\u2019re going to Cleveland, people will be like, \u2018I got some for you,\u2019\u201d Kristi said.\n\n\u201cOr some people will post (on Facebook) that they have this giant bag of pull tabs and people will tag us on it,\u201d Bryan added.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe family collects the tabs in large plastic tubs and then takes them to Cleveland every time they have an appointment at the clinic. In 2020, when the Ronald McDonald House couldn\u2019t accept pull tabs due to COVID, the family had to store 180 pounds of tabs in their garage.\n\n\u201cDuring the flood of 2020, we had three big totes in our garage, so we\u2019re thankful that the water that ran through the garage didn\u2019t go over the totes because that would have been a really big mess,\u201d Bryan said.\n\n\u201cAnd it would have been really sad if we lost all of our pull tabs,\u201d Kristi added.\n\nBrayden plans to continue collecting pull tabs and hopes to achieve the one million goal multiple times in his life.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be going to (the Cleveland Clinic) for his whole life, so we\u2019ll probably just keep collecting as long as we go,\u201d Kristi said.\n\nIn addition to individuals in the community, the family also receives pull tabs from local businesses and organizations, like the Boulevard Lounge and the American Legion. They are hoping to create more partnerships like this as they work to collect one million tabs again.\n\nFamilies interested in donating pull tabs to Brayden can drop them off with Bryan Meyers at PPG Paints in Midland at 612 S. Saginaw Road.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad",

Mich. \u2014 Congresswoman Kristen McDonald Rivet held a press conference addressing the local impact of the recent freeze on federal funding Friday, Jan. 30, 2025 at the Thelma Buffy building.\n\nOn Monday, the Trump administration issued a memo that froze all grant and loan payments from federal agencies, including those for essential services like Head Start, Medicaid, meals on wheels and health clinics.\n\nAccording to a press release from the Congresswoman\u2019s office, Head Start and health care providers reported they were locked out of their federal portals, preventing access to payment systems for staffing and essential services.\n\nThe memo was later rescinded on Wednesday, Jan. 29 after widespread confusion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfrozen, but [the administration has] been very, very clear that these things are still under consideration for being cut,\u201d McDonald Rivet said. \u201cI\u2019m here to say that, as your member of Congress, I will do everything in my power despite any further attacks on our essential services that mid-Michigan families really rely on.\u201d\n\nShe was joined by community leaders who emphasized the potential impact of Head Start\u2019s discontinuation.\n\nHead Start is the largest and oldest nationwide federally-funded program that provides all-inclusive early childhood education and services to low-income families.\n\nGenesee Intermediate School District (GISD) offers free Head Start programming for children as young as 6 weeks old who live in Flint, Beecher and Carmen-Ainsworth school districts.\n\nMelissa Ricketts, one of thousands of Head Start employees and mother of children who attend the program, spoke about how a loss of funding could affect her family.\n\n\u201cWhen arriving to work Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025 I received the vague news that I may or may not have a job\u2026if our funding were to be cut off\u2026that would leave me without a job and many children without care as well,\u201d Rickett said.\n\nIn order to get a new job, she would have to first find childcare and most likely be added an extensive waiting list.\n\nAccording to McDonald Rivet, the State of Michigan has lost 40% of its capacity within the last 10 years and infant/toddler care has an average wait time of two years due to a workforce that is understaffed.\n\nPrincipal of Pumpkin Patch Early Childhood Center Douglas Hibbs pointed out that within the Thelma Buffy building, there are programs that impact more than 400 families, with Head Start impacting more than fifty.\n\n\u201cWas I surprised? Absolutely\u2026it blows my mind that we\u2019re going to take money from education,\u201d he said, noting the importance of early childhood development especially between birth and five years.\n\nHe emphasized the still-present fallout from the Flint Water Crisis and Covid-19, as well as the community\u2019s struggles with crime and economic challenges, characterizing Head Start as a \u201cvital\u201d resource for Flint-based families.\n\n\u201cIn Flint, Michigan\u2026we\u2019re an incredibly proud community that works hard. However, we all know that we have major impacts,\u201d said Hibbs.\n\nMoving forward, McDonald Rivet vowed to work with partners and stakeholders to fight this in the courts.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about cutting waste in the budget, which I\u2019m all for\u2026of course, we can make our government more efficient..but when you put programs like Head Start in the cross hairs for elimination, programs that have decades and decades of research that show that they work, then it\u2019s gone too far,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are real people who rely on these services\u2026in order to live their lives, and we can\u2019t have them in jeopardy.\u201d\n\nShe asks that all organizations and individuals in the region who have been affected to contact her office as they continue to track local impact and advocate on their behalf.",

            "content": "Zachary David \"Zach\" McDonald, a beloved soul who graced this world with his kindness and humor, passed away on January 30, 2025, in his hometown of Cheyenne, Wyoming, where he was born on September 18, 1989. He departed this life at the young age of 35, leaving behind a legacy of loyalty and love that will resonate with all who knew him.\n\nWhen Zach was a young boy, he lived with his grandparents Ron and Nancy McDonald along with his dad, Alan. He started kindergarten in Burns, WY and graduated from High School in Burns in 2008. In the 1st grade, his teacher made him take his boots off when he got to school, and this is when his troublemaker attitude came out. He got upset, stomped out of school and walked his way home across town and passed the railroad tracks. He was always taking on other people's causes and sticking up for them. When he wasn't at school, he loved roping with Pop's (Ron McDonald) or playing army with his brothers. He had to take on the entire role of Army including the outfits which called for his dad taking him to thrift stores to find Battle Dress Uniforms. During one of his roping adventures with Pop's, he was told he wouldn't be able to go again because he was too naughty that day. He tapped pop's on the shoulder and asked \"Can we at least be a little-bit naughty?\" and that's when Pop's knew he was a handful of a grandkid. If he wasn't roping or playing Army, he was watching Disney movies with his Nana (Nancy McDonald).\n\nZach's journey took him through various careers, where he became an expert in every endeavor he undertook. From his early days working at TA Taco Bell during high school, to his time as a driver at Magic City, and his role as an Aquatics and Reptile expert at PETCO, Zach approached each job with enthusiasm and a thirst for knowledge. His tenure at MAGPUL as a line lead and quality control was marked by his dedication and meticulous attention to detail, while his position as an administrative assistant at Merritt Plumbing showcased his versatility and adaptability.\n\nAn alumnus of LCCC, Zach was not just an employee but a beacon of friendship and camaraderie. His personality shone brightly; he had a remarkable ability to make everyone feel unique. To be a friend of Zach was to know a connection that would last a lifetime, buoyed by his unmatched loyalty. He had an infectious spirit, one that was both kind and funny; he could lift your spirits with a mere smile or a shared laugh.\n\nZach cherished his family deeply, and one of the proudest moments in his life was becoming an uncle to his beloved nephew, Ronald Roy McDonald. The memory of holding little Ronnie for the first time in the hospital is a treasure that will remain etched in the hearts of those who loved him. As a Godparent to Jayden and Zayne Lincoln, he welcomed the role with open arms, embracing the responsibility with the same love and affection that he extended to his family and friends alike.\n\nZach's interests were as diverse as his pursuits. He found great joy in fishing, forging knives, and proudly supported the Green Bay Packers. His love for America was palpable, and he spent countless joyous hours hanging out with friends, listening to music, or simply enjoying the camaraderie of those around him. Friday nights spent watching football together with a close friend are cherished moments that encapsulate the warmth of his friendships.\n\nHe is survived by his father, Alan McDonald; step-mother, Cathy McDonald; mother, Leah McCloud; brother, Bradley McDonald, sister-in-law, Michele McDonald, nephew Jonathan Cuccia and niece Madison Cuccia; brother, Shane McDonald, sister-in-law, Brittany McDonald, nephew Ronald Roy McDonald; grandparental figures, Ronald and Nancy McDonald; and an array of devoted friends, including Jordyn Parry and T.J. Lincoln, along with his God-sons, Jayden and Zayne Lincoln.\n\nA memorial service to honor Zach's life will be held on February 8, 2025, at Destiny Church in Cheyenne, Wyoming, offering family and friends an opportunity to gather together, share stories, and celebrate the profound impact he had on their lives.\n\nZachary David McDonald was more than a man defined by his careers; he was a friend, a brother, and above all, a beloved son and grandson. His spirit will continue to reside in the hearts of those who had the privilege to know him, leaving behind memories that will forever echo with laughter and love.",

The initiative, aimed at providing comfort and support to families with children undergoing medical treatments, showcased the sailors\u2019 commitment to serving not just their country, but their local community as well.\n\n\n\nThe event took place at local Ronald McDonald House Durham, where Sailors worked together to prepare an assortment of cookies, including chocolate chip, red velvet, and M&M. The baked goods were hot and ready for the families at the Ronald McDonald House, offering families a small taste of home during their challenging times.\n\n\n\nPetty Officer NC2 Nebe, one of the Sailors who participated, shared the significance of the initiative stating, \u201cBeing able to give back in a personal way means so much to us. We know these families are going through a difficult time, and something as simple as a warm cookie can bring a little joy to their day.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Ronald McDonald House provides housing and support for families with children receiving critical medical care, ensuring they can stay close to their loved ones without the burden of costly accommodations. The sailors\u2019 volunteer work not only provided fresh-baked comfort but also reinforced the Navy\u2019s strong tradition of community service.\n\n\n\nOfficials from the Ronald McDonald House expressed their gratitude for the Sailors\u2019 efforts. Multiple representatives from the organization stated, \u201cWe are incredibly thankful for the Navy\u2019s support. Their generosity and kindness make a real difference for the families we serve.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis baking initiative is part of a larger effort by the Navy Recruiting Command to engage in community outreach programs. The Sailors hope to make this a recurring tradition, strengthening their ties with the local community and continuing to bring smiles to those in need.\n\n\n\nFor families staying at the Ronald McDonald House, the smell of fresh-baked cookies and the warm-hearted efforts of the sailors serve as a reminder that they are not alone in their journey.\n\n\n\nNTAG Carolina includes 53 Navy recruiting stations across the states of North Carolina, South Carolina and Augusta, Georgia.

            "content": "For as long as WNBA superstar Angel Reese can remember, the McDonald's brand has been synonymous with basketball.\n\nAnd she's not alone. From TV commercials starring NBA legends like Michael Jordan and LeBron James to the brand\u2019s involvement in youth basketball, working with McDonald\u2019s has given a generation of athletes a new Wheaties box moment to strive towards.\n\n\"My biggest dream was to always be a McDonald's All-American,\" Reese told Just Women's Sports last week. And while Reese might have missed out on the All-American game as a high schooler due to pandemic-related shutdowns, her first professional alignment with McDonald's might end up being even more significant.\n\nNext month, Reese will become the first-ever women's basketball player to lend her name to a signature McDonald's meal deal, the Angel Reese Special. Inspired by \"Angel's boldly original style and swag,\" the combo \u2014 a Bold BBQ Bacon Quarter Pounder with Cheese plus fries and a drink \u2014 this drive-thrus across the country on February 10th.\n\nOf course, McDonald's partnerships aren't limited to the world of sports. Musical artists and pop culture moguls like Saweetie, Cardi B, Travis Scott, and more have collaborated with the fast food giant in recent years. So it makes perfect sense that Reese, known for balancing a burgeoning pro career with influential projects off the court, is the first women's basketball player to make the leap.\n\n\"Obviously I'm a basketball player, but one day the ball will stop, and I always wanted to be more than that,\" she said. \"That's why I try to tap into other things \u2014 my podcast, fashion, and everything else. To know I'm listed with some of the [McDonald's] greats obviously is a great feeling.\"\n\n\"It's amazing,\" she added. \"It's bigger than basketball.\"\n\nReese has been honing her offseason skills as part with 3\u00d73 league Unrivaled. (Carmen Mandato/Getty Images)\n\nLearning from WNBA legends\n\n\"Bigger than basketball\" has long been Reese's driving ethos. She takes her image very seriously, aiming to show little girls they too can make strides in the business of basketball. But she also wants global audiences to know that women's basketball has always been cutting edge.\n\n\"Lisa Leslie, she's been a face, putting on her gloss and makeup for games,\" Reese said. \"Skylar [Diggins-Smith]'s been into fashion, They were wearing Skylar's jerseys \u2014 Drake, Wayne. You've got to realize this has been going on.\"\n\nEntering her second year in the WNBA, the Chicago Sky rookie cherished the opportunity to personally give her role models their flowers.\n\n\"You guys helped me get to this point. You guys walked so I can run,\" she said, referencing the messages she's been able to give icons like Leslie and Diggins-Smith. \"I'm doing these things because you guys did it.\"\n\nReese is currently starring for Rose BC, one of the six teams making up Unrivaled 3\u00d73 Basketball's inaugural season. In Miami, she has a front-row seat to how established WNBA stars handle their personal brands, both on and off the court.\n\n\"It's like a summer camp \u2014 I'm learning everything from the vets,\" she said. \"These are like my big sisters here, and I'm just enjoying everything.\"\n\nReese has had a busy 2024, both on and off the court. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n\nDon't knock the hustle\n\nReese has been grinding non-stop since her senior year at LSU. Her longest break, she noted, only came after she suffered a season-ending wrist fracture playing for Chicago in early September. But the moment she was cleared to play, she moved to Miami and got to work.\n\nReflecting on her jam-packed 2024, Reese credits the professionals around her for helping her internalize many of the things rookies have to learn on the fly. These growing pains include reshaping ideas about how to eat, recovery, skill work, and avoiding burnout by taking time for yourself.\n\n\"There's no better time than now,\" she said emphatically. \"I'm getting better because I'm around pros literally every single day.\"\n\n\"I think people forget that sometimes, that basketball has gotten me to being this superstar, and that's my main focus,\" she continues.\n\nThe 22-year-old has been in frequent contact with incoming Chicago head coach Tyler Marsh throughout the offseason. She's eager for the Sky to compete in the free agency market, putting together a core that can carry the team for years to come \u2014 some of which came early in reports of the signing of veteran point guard Courtney Vandersloot.\n\nThe ultimate goal is making the 2025 playoffs, before launching a deep postseason run.\n\nMcDonald's deal is just the beginning for Reese\n\nBetween sponsorship opportunities, Unrivaled, and the WNBA, Reese's life is a juggling act. But she trusts that by continuing to grow on the court, everything else will fall into place. Like her McDonald's deal, she's always thinking about the bigger picture.\n\n\"I want somebody to be able to go to McDonald's and get a cup with Angel Reese's face on it. Like, who doesn't want to do that?\" she said with a laugh. \"Even with some of my other things I have going on \u2014 going in the store and getting my cereal box, small things like that \u2014 it should always be accessible.\"\n\n\"Women should be accessible,\" she emphasized. \"We should be easy to see. We can turn on TNT every single night here and watch Unrivaled \u2014 this is what we deserve.\"",

            "content": "AUGUSTA, Ga. (WRDW/WAGT) - Not everyone receiving care at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Georgia lives in the CSRA. That\u2019s where the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Augusta steps in.\n\nWe shared with you back in September about how they house families at no cost while their child receives treatment .\n\nWith the cancellation of an annual fundraiser, they\u2019re now looking ahead to ways they can gain the community\u2019s support.\n\nThey\u2019re finding solutions in how they can get you to help them serve thousands of families at the children\u2019s hospital.\n\nThe Ronald McDonald House Charities of Augusta has been helping families for 40 years.\n\nChurch offers resource center to community Smiles, laughter and a good time is what you would have found at Beulah Grove Community Resource Center\u2019s senior day.\n\nWith their 23-bedroom house located steps away from the children\u2019s hospital, they\u2019re able to give families a place to stay.\n\n\u201cBeing that close to the hospital means that no matter where they come from, they are right by their child\u2019s side and keeping families together. We are working to remove barriers for families. We\u2019re strengthening those families by keeping them together and we are promoting healing for their child,\u201d said David Jacobsen, president and CEO of Ronald McDonald House Charities of Augusta.\n\nThis is made possible at no cost to the families because of the community\u2019s support and through annual fundraisers, like Wine, Women and Shoes.\n\nSadly, the event for 2024 was canceled because of Hurricane Helene.\n\nInstead of originally postponing it, they have now decided to look ahead to this year\u2019s event in September.\n\nAshlee Duren, board chair of Ronald McDonald House Charities of Augusta, said: \u201cWe just knew that the community as a whole wasn\u2019t ready for something of this magnitude, and we wanted to make sure we were respectful of that. We also wanted to make sure we had a great fundraising event and felt pushing it off until the fall was the best thing for everybody, so we are really looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nSecond Act Thrift Store sees \u2018abnormal days\u2019 after opening We told you back in September about the Second Act Thrift Store located downtown on 8th Street. Since opening on Sept. 20, the Second Act Thrift Store has experienced a lot.\n\nShe says despite not having last year\u2019s event, that doesn\u2019t affect their ability to help families.\n\nOne new way they are doing that is through this hospitality cart that is full of goodies to take to families at the hospital.\n\nJacobsen said: \u201cThis program, we need volunteers that are qualified through the hospital and RMHC to take that same comfort of the house and extend it to every room in the children\u2019s hospital.\u201d\n\nThey say volunteers are greatly needed right now so that they can continue their mission.\n\nDuren said: \u201cI think it\u2019s critically important that people understand the mission of the Ronald McDonald House and the things that we have here in this community that can really help them while their children are sick and allow them to really focus on their child.\u201d\n\nThe Wine, Women and Shoes fundraiser is set for Sept. 18.\n\nUntil then, you can support them by volunteering for the hospitality cart or signing up for their family table where you can provide food and cook for the families who stay at the Ronald McDonald House.\n\nFor more information, visit https://rmhcaugusta.org/.\n\nCopyright 2025 WRDW/WAGT.

            "content": "By Jenna Somers\n\nA transdisciplinary team at Vanderbilt University seeks to identify Tennessee communities at risk of exposure to toxic man-made chemicals in their drinking water.\n\nIn response to a 2024 regulation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) has awarded an 18-month, $352,944 grant to Yolanda J. McDonald, assistant professor of human and organizational development and principal investigator at Vanderbilt\u2019s Drinking Water Justice Lab, to lead a transdisciplinary team to support TDEC\u2019s efforts to predict and monitor toxins in Tennessee\u2019s community water systems and to identify communities at risk for contamination.\n\nThe chemicals\u2014known as PFAS for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances\u2014are found in consumer and industrial products, such as cleaning supplies, cookware, and food packaging. Commonly referred to as \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d PFAS do not easily disintegrate in the environment, and therefore can contaminate water supplies. Exposure to these chemicals, even at low levels, poses severe health risks, including cancer, liver and thyroid damage, and complications with fertility and fetal development.\n\nGiven these risks, in April 2024, the EPA finalized the National Primary Drinking Water Regulation establishing legally enforceable maximum contaminant levels for six PFAS chemicals in drinking water. Public water systems must complete initial monitoring by 2027 and implement solutions to reduce PFAS levels by 2029.\n\nThe Vanderbilt-led project, \u201cPFAS Risk in Tennessee Drinking Water Supply: A Data-Driven Risk-Informed Approach to Identify Communities At-Risk to PFAS Exposure,\u201d brings together researchers from Peabody College of education and human development, the School of Engineering, and the Vanderbilt Institute for Spatial Research at the College of Arts and Science to complete two primary goals:\n\nTo develop an evidence-based approach that uses machine learning models to monitor and predict PFAS chemical levels in Tennessee\u2019s drinking water in compliance with the EPA regulation\n\nTo identify small, disadvantaged, and rural communities whose community water systems have PFAS contamination, so that they can receive funding from the Emerging Contaminants in Small or Disadvantaged Communities grant program to reduce toxin levels\n\nThe team plans to develop four machine learning models to predict PFAS contamination levels statewide and across West, Middle, and East Tennessee. They will also create a geospatial assessment tool to analyze PFAS compounds in vulnerable communities and provide TDEC with a project summary report.\n\nThe geospatial assessment tool will be informed by 16 drinking water justice indicators focused on socio-economic status, race and ethnicity, age, education levels, and more, as well as four distinct types of vulnerable communities identified by state and federal policies and the Appalachian Regional Commission.\n\n\u201cOur team\u2019s critical data and tools will help TDEC identify communities across Tennessee to understand whether and to what extent they are exposed to PFAS contamination and empower them to access the necessary resources to remove these toxins,\u201d said McDonald. \u201cThe Drinking Water Justice Lab has been conducting research in collaboration with TDEC, the Tennessee Department of Health, and the Tennessee Association of Utility Districts for several years, and we are eager for the potential for our working group to do even more to help protect the health of Tennesseans.\u201d\n\nIn addition to McDonald, the project leaders are Hiba Baroud, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of the Vanderbilt Center for Sustainability, Energy, and Climate (VSEC); Paul Johnson, research assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering; Natalie Robbins, research analyst in the Department of Anthropology and the program manager and geospatial lead at the Vanderbilt Institute for Spatial Research, and Sriya Jonnakuti, research assistant.\n\nThe grant also provides immersive research learning experiences for Ferna Alvarez-Carrascal, Ph.D. student in Earth and environmental sciences, and Vera Powell, second-year student double majoring in environmental sociology and law, history, and society and minoring in chemistry.\n\nThis study continues the original research of Aakash Manapat, BA\u201924, McDonald\u2019s former student advisee. In 2021, he was supported by the Vanderbilt Undergraduate Summer Research Program to co-develop the original machine learning model using the Kentucky data to predict the presence of PFAS contaminants in Tennessee\u2019s community water systems. The Drinking Water Justice Lab now has access to Tennessee PFAS data to refine the model. Manapat will continue to consult with this project team.",

His attorney verified he died last year in Chicago.\n\nA former Santa Rosa man died last year just weeks after reaching a $120,000 settlement with Sonoma County in a federal civil rights lawsuit that accused authorities of excessive force during his 2019 arrest.\n\nLa\u2019Marcus McDonald, who was living in Chicago to be closer to family, settled with the county Aug. 21, 2024, and the case was dismissed the following month in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, according to his attorney and county officials.\n\nMcDonald died in October at about age 40, his attorney Reed Kathrein said. While he had suffered from poor health, an official cause of death was not publicly available.\n\n\u201cHe was a great person and everyone who knew him loved him,\u201d Kathrein said. He added that his father raised McDonald and the two were as close as brothers.\n\nNews of McDonald\u2019s death surfaced publicly after a friend mentioned it in a social media post last week, prompting The Press Democrat to investigate the status of his lawsuit and settlement.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the Sonoma County Independent Office of Law Enforcement Review & Outreach, the Sheriff\u2019s Office watchdog, ever investigated the matter.\n\nShortly after McDonald filed his lawsuit in 2020, then-IOLERO Director Karlene Navarro told The Press Democrat that her office had not received a report on the incident.\n\nLast week, current IOLERO Director John Alden declined to comment on whether the case was reviewed, stating that his office does not discuss individual cases unless they involve specific circumstances, such as the use of lethal force.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s lawsuit alleged excessive force\n\nMcDonald filed the federal lawsuit in June 2020, claiming a Sonoma County sheriff\u2019s deputy slammed his face into the ground after finding him asleep in a parked vehicle July 9, 2019.\n\nHis complaint alleged civil rights violations, negligent hiring,intentional infliction of emotional distress, false arrest and battery, among other claims.\n\nThe encounter took place in Windsor, where the Sheriff\u2019s Office provides police services under contract. The lawsuit named Deputy Travis Perkins, then-Sheriff Mark Essick, Deputy Gregory Clegg, Sgt. Brent Kidder, Sonoma County and the town of Windsor as defendants.\n\nClegg was dismissed from the lawsuit in July 2023, court records show.\n\nSonoma County denied any wrongdoing in the case. The county contends McDonald\u2019s arrest and detention were legal and appropriate, said Paul Gullixson, Sonoma County\u2019s communications manager. He declined to comment further on the settlement.\n\nSheriff\u2019s officials confirmed that Perkins, Clegg and Kidder remain employed with the department.\n\nArrest stemmed from welfare check\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, McDonald was asleep in a car on Bell Road near the Windsor Mobile Country Club, where his mother lived. Because the community had age restrictions \u2014 55 and older \u2014 he could not stay there overnight.\n\nA passerby called 911 for a welfare check.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s lawsuit said that while he had permission to sleep in the car from its owner, he had been drinking before falling asleep and was disoriented when Deputy Perkins woke him up.\n\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Office had previously said McDonald was investigated because he was intoxicated in the front seat of a parked vehicle and later resisted arrest.\n\nMcDonald alleged Perkins knocked him unconscious, causing a concussion, damage to two teeth and knocking out a third. He further claimed that Deputy Clegg failed to intervene and that Sgt. Kidder later approved the arrest report.\n\nAfter the arrest, McDonald was taken to a hospital before being booked into the Sonoma County jail on suspicion of misdemeanor resisting arrest.\n\nHowever, the Sonoma County District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to file charges \u2014 a decision that became a key argument in McDonald\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nYou can reach Staff Writer Colin Atagi at colin.atagi@pressdemocrat.com.

Family members now, reacting to news of the arrest.\n\nErica Davis, the victim's mother, expressed her desire for justice in the case. \"I will see any and everyone in court,\" she said, emphasizing the need for accountability. \"It does not matter that it's a 15-year-old. He committed a crime. He took away my oldest son,\" she added. \"My household was raised off of accountability. So, we definitely are looking for accountability for his actions.\"\n\nThe shooting happened on January 12, with Davis's son, an employee at the restaurant, witnessing the tragic event. The incident has left a lasting impact on the community, particularly due to the familial connection. Resident Tyohn Moore commented on the tragedy, saying, \"Them being related, that's what makes it so tragic... witnessing his family, his father. I don't know how I would react. To be honest, I probably would lose my mind.\"\n\nErica Davis also spoke about her grandson, Jamal, who is coping with the aftermath of the incident. \"Jamal is doing as well as to be expected. Every day is a different day. We wake up, it's different feelings each day. So, he's taking it one day at a time,\" she said.\n\nAddressing the broader issue of gun violence involving juvenile offenders in the city, Davis highlighted the profound impact on her family. \"They do not understand the impact because it definitely has torn a big hole in the Davis household and the Davis family. Because it has left a bad, a sour taste in all of our mouths,\" she said.",

            "content": "BAY CITY, MI \u2013 Republican legislators across the Great Lakes Bay area are calling on the governor to schedule a special election to fill the vacant 35th State Senate seat, arguing it would restore vital services to residents currently without representation.\n\nState representatives Timothy Beson (R-Bay City), Matthew Bierlein (R-Vassar), Tim Kelly (R-Saginaw Township) and Bill G. Schuette (R-Midland) issued a joint statement Tuesday, Jan. 28, urging Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to call for a special election to fill the seat vacated by former Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet following her election to the U.S. Congress.\n\nThe lawmakers' statement follows a similar appeal made by mid-Michigan chambers of commerce a day earlier.\n\n\u201cEvery day that goes by without a special election being called is a day people across our area will be without constituent services they expect and deserve,\u201d the statement, signed by the four lawmakers, reads. \u201cWhile members of the Michigan House remain committed to answering people\u2019s questions, hearing their concerns and helping them navigate state government, multiple layers of representation provide the best return for taxpayers.\n\n\u201cGaps in these layers put people at a disadvantage compared to other residents and communities. House members can help with services but can\u2019t vote on the people\u2019s behalf in the Senate or ask questions in Senate committees regarding issues that impact their everyday lives. These are critical times in our state, and right now nearly 300,000 workers, small business owners, parents, teachers, first responders, local officials and others in this impacted area have less of a voice than they did before.\n\n\u201cWe call on Gov. Whitmer to immediately call for a special election and deliver clarity for hardworking people and their families across our communities.\u201d\n\nRelated: Taking the oath as new member of Congress left McDonald Rivet \u2018awestruck\u2019\n\nMcDonald Rivet, who formerly served in the Michigan Senate, the Bay City Charter Commission and the Bay City Commission, was elected as the new 8th District U.S. Representative, replacing longtime U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, who didn\u2019t seek re-election in 2024.\n\nShe took the oath during a swearing-in ceremony on Monday, Jan. 27, in Judge Shalina D. Kumar\u2019s courtroom at the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in downtown Flint.\n\nThis week, the Bay Area Chamber of Commerce, Midland Business Alliance and Saginaw County Chamber of Commerce requested the governor call for a special election in an open letter. These organizations represent business interests in communities that fall partially under Michigan\u2019s 35th District.\n\nRead more: Kristen McDonald Rivet sworn in as new Michigan 8th District representative\n\n\u201cOur community deserves strong representation to address the critical issues that impact our families, businesses, and future,\u201d Bay Area Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Magen M. Samyn wrote in a statement. \u201cCalling a special election ensures the voices of the 35th District are heard without delay.\u201d\n\nThe district represents more than 270,000 residents and businesses, the organizations noted in the letter.\n\nWhen a vacancy occurs in the state legislature, the governor can either call a special election in that senatorial or representative district or direct the vacancy be filled at the next general election.\n\nRepublican lawmakers previously called for a special election before the new year, arguing for the lack of representation for those living in the mid-Michigan region McDonald Rivet previously represented.\n\nWant more Bay City- and Saginaw-area news?

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThis year's class of McDonald's All Americans was announced on Monday on ESPN's \"NBA Today.\"\n\nThe lineup includes 24 of the top 32 players in the current ESPNW 100 -- although the class will get a ranking update after the high school season. Stanford and Tennessee lead the way with three signees each, while LSU has two. There are 17 programs represented, and there are two players who have yet to announce where they're going.\n\nOf these players, 11 competed in the Nike EYBL, six played on the Under Armour Next Circuit, four played on the adidas 3SSB circuit, and three competed in the independent Select 40 circuit.\n\nThe game will be played in Brooklyn at the Barclays Center on April 1 (ESPN2/ESPN App, 6:30 p.m. ET).\n\nWith this year's All-Americans announced, we break down each player's development and what separates them from the rest of the country, as well as what to expect from them at the college level.\n\nG Darianna Alexander\n\n6-foot-1 | Purcell Marian HS (Ohio) | West Virginia Thunder | Cincinnati\n\nESPNW ranking: 8\n\nAlexander is a physical guard who can play multiple perimeter positions. She has logged a lot of minutes at the lead guard in high school, and she gets out and runs the lanes for a quick slash to the basket. Alexander rebounds extremely well for a guard and ignites the break quickly as she uses her strength to get to the rim and her vision to facilitate. She is arguably the biggest signee in Cincinnati program history. Alexander won multiple Girls Under Armour circuit championships with the West Virginia Thunder.\n\nAlexander will represent the USA squad in April's Nike Hoop Summit. Expect her to add a competitive punch to Katrina Merriweather's program.\n\nC Sienna Betts\n\n6-4 | Grandview HS (Colorado) | Hardwood Elite | UCLA\n\nESPNW ranking: 2\n\nBetts is a representation of what it is to be a 5-player in today's game of space and pace. She can battle inside, and she has the skills and feel away from the paint to be effective. Betts dominates the glass, challenges shots defensively and sees the floor as well as anyone in the class. When a player can post strong, face up and put the ball on the floor -- but also counter with the jumper -- they are a tough cover. Betts is a legitimate triple-double threat game in and game out. She is unlike any other in the class at her position in that regard. Betts' team, Hardwood Elite, won the adidas 3SSB Championship in 2023, and her Grandview High School team won the Colorado state championship in 2024.\n\nSienna was named to the 12-member Nike Hoop Summit to go along with many accolades from her high school career. She will add depth to UCLA's already strong front line when she gets to Westwood.\n\nW Nyla Brooks\n\n6-1 | Bishop Ireton (Virginia) | Boo Williams | North Carolina\n\nESPNW ranking: 20\n\nBrooks is a slashing wing with a knack for a pull-up jumper. Over her high school career, she became more of a consistent 3-point threat, rising among the class. Brooks uses her length on the glass and on defense very well. Her ability to create space for the pull-up jumper separates her.\n\nBrooks will bring a scoring punch to the perimeter for Courtney Banghart and the Tar Heels. This will provide some balance as they have been strong inside and can utilize Brooks' ability to score off the bounce to their advantage.\n\nW/F Kaelyn Carroll\n\n6-2 | Tabor Academy (Massachusetts) | Bay State Jaguars | Kentucky\n\nESPNW ranking: 15\n\nCarroll is a highly skilled forward who is also comfortable playing the wing role. Her size and handle at that spot are valuable and a tough matchup for opponents. Carroll's ability to move without the ball and spot up for the 3 are separators, and her advanced handle to attack the closeout makes her game elite. She is solid in post-up situations, and she can play out of the block, midpost or pinch post -- versatility not seen in many.\n\nCarroll will give Kentucky a floor spacer to complement the interior play and possibly create mismatches in many areas.\n\nPG Aaliyah Chavez\n\n5-11 | Lubbock Monterey HS (Texas) | CyFair Elite | Undecided\n\nESPNW ranking: 1\n\nChavez is the best scorer in this class. Her ability to knock down long-range shots is hard to top. She has a reputation for her work ethic and shooting routines, and it shows in her confidence to make big shots. Chavez knows how to get to her spots and leverages her ability to shoot to keep defenses guessing with subtle changes of pace. She knows how to get to the free throw line, and she has a quality midrange game.\n\nChavez was named to the 2025 Nike Hoop Summit. Her CyFair Elite team won two Nike EYBL titles during her tenure. Wherever she decides to go will get an elite shotmaker.\n\nG Jaida Civil\n\n6-foot | Palm Bay HS (Florida) | East Coast United | Tennessee\n\nESPNW ranking: 32\n\nCivil is a one-player fast break -- that's how speedy she is with the ball. She pushes the ball in transition, attacking the paint as well as anyone in the country. As a guard who brings pressure and intensity defensively, she immediately enhances the break when she rebounds. She elevates and finishes at the rim with acrobatic layups, but most importantly, she spreads the ball to open teammates, creating easy scoring opportunities. She has improved her jump shot and has a trustworthy midrange game. As her 3-ball becomes more consistent, she will be a tough cover.\n\nCivil fits the new age Tennessee system Kim Caldwell brings. Civil will excel in the pressing scheme and bring value attacking the paint and assisting on quick 3s early in the shot clock.\n\nG Aaliyah Crump\n\n6-1 | Montverde Academy (Florida) | All Iowa Attack | Texas\n\nESPNW ranking: 5\n\nCrump is a guard with a strong frame. She knows how to use her body to position herself well on drives to the rim. She has all-around skill and is comfortable all over the floor. She can catch fire from deep and also punish smaller defenders inside and on the glass. She has all of the tools to be an elite defender.\n\nCrump is another McDonald's All American who will represent the USA squad at the Nike Hoop Summit. The Longhorns will get another versatile perimeter player.\n\nG Jasmine Davidson\n\n6-1 | Clackamas HS (Oregon) | Cal Stars | USC\n\nESPNW ranking: 3\n\nDavidson is the most complete perimeter player in the 2025 class. Her offensive skills get the headlines -- she is a long and smooth player who can knock down the 3 as well as slash to the rim. She is also an elite defender who will only get better in college, and she moves well without the ball.\n\nDavidson will get to play at home in Portland at the Nike Hoop Summit. An extremely talented USC roster will get a skilled perimeter player and another lock-down defender to add to its young program.\n\nF Jaliya Davis\n\n6-2 | Blue Valley North (Kansas) | Missouri Phenom | Kansas\n\nESPNW ranking: 17\n\nDavis is one of the premier forwards in the class. In an age when most players want to be perimeter-oriented, Davis does her work in and around the paint like an old-school forward. She has exceptional rebounding ability and a touch around the rim, combined with a fundamental back-to-the-basket game. Davis' second-jump reaction time and the effort and energy she brings to the floor help her fill a valuable role.\n\nDavis will bring a blue-collar approach that will lead to consistent production for Brandon Schneider and Kansas.\n\nG Addison Deal\n\n6-foot | Mater Dei HS (California) | Cal Stars | Iowa\n\nESPNW ranking: 18\n\nDeal is a steady perimeter player with all the answers fundamentally. She has supreme confidence in her long-range shooting, and for good reason. Deal attacks the rim with a slashing ability and can create her own shot off the bounce. She has glue-like intangibles and can play out of pick-and-roll actions. Defensively, she competes extremely hard and will guard multiple perimeter positions.\n\nThe Iowa program is used to seeing complete perimeter players who know how to shoot and share the basketball, and that's exactly what Jan Jensen will get in Deal.\n\nAlex Eschmeyer will bring a versatile post game to Stanford. USA Basketball\n\nP/F Alexandra Eschmeyer\n\n6-5 | Peak to Peak Charter (Colorado) | Colorado Hoopsters | Stanford\n\nESPNW ranking: 31\n\nAnother quality player from Colorado, Eschmeyer is more than just a 6-5 post. She has consistent range from beyond the 3-point line, smoothly runs the floor and can put the ball on the floor to attack the basket. She finishes well with either hand around the rim and is an active and mobile defender with her size and length. As she has developed, adding strength to her base and the ability to move and come off screens for 3s has been eye-catching.\n\nEschmeyer will also play in the Nike Hoop Summit. She will bring the versatile post game we are accustomed to seeing at Stanford over the years -- similar to Ashten Prechtel (2019 McDonald's All American from Colorado).\n\nG ZaKiyah Johnson\n\n6-foot | Sacred Heart Academy (Kentucky) | West Virginia Thunder | LSU\n\nESPNW ranking: 13\n\nJohnson is a strong guard who is best attacking the rim or pulling up in the midrange. She is an elite defender and plays hard on the ball with her length and agility. Johnson is a high-level rebounder who can ignite the break in a hurry and increase the pace of the game. Her impact led to winning two titles in the Under Armour Circuit for her West Virginia Thunder squad.\n\nJohnson was also named to the Nike Hoop Summit team for the USA. She will be a rugged competitor for LSU, a requisite for Kim Mulkey teams.\n\nF Grace Knox\n\n6-2 | Etiwanda HS (California) | Cal Sparks | LSU\n\nESPNW ranking: 6\n\nKnox is an energetic forward who always leaves an imprint on the court. She is a relentless competitor who can be physical, but also has the soft touch of a rangy jump shot and displays acrobatic finishing at the rim. Knox is the type to be the first to dive onto the floor or fly in from across the court to get a tip in on the offensive glass. She is a versatile defender and runs the floor with ease. Knox and her Cal Sparks won the Nike EYBL circuit championship in 2023 to go with multiple CIF state championships in high school.\n\nKnox will be part of the Nike Hoop Summit USA squad of 12 in April. When she takes the floor for LSU next season, she will be an elite competitive forward, something we're used to seeing for the Tigers.\n\nF Leah Macy\n\n6-2 | Bethlehem HS (Kentucky) | West Virginia Thunder | Notre Dame\n\nESPNW ranking: 19\n\nMacy is as fundamentally as anyone in this class. Her footwork and base of skills help her bring poise and versatility to the floor that allow her to match up with multiple positions. Macy has a soft touch from 3, facilitates well and is a good decision-maker and passer, and she is not afraid to get physical around the paint. She approaches the game with maturity.\n\nNiele Ivey and the Notre Dame program are getting a forward who will stretch the floor and excel in their Princeton-style patterned offense, as Macy is comfortable all over the court.\n\nW Agot Makeer\n\n6-1 | Montverde Academy (Florida) | Kia Nurse Elite | Undecided\n\nESPNW ranking: 4\n\nMakeer is a long and agile wing who has shown the ability to play lead guard, but also can be assertive in scoring. Known early as an aggressive slasher, Makeer went to work and became a quality 3-point shooter, making her game that much harder to handle for defenders. She uses that ability to be a quality playmaker particularly in transition. Her physical attributes and competitiveness lend to her being a capable high-level defender.\n\nShe will use her experience on the Canadian national team and Montverde to bring a sought-after prospect to any program she chooses.\n\nF Ayla McDowell\n\n6-2 | Cypress Springs HS (Texas) | CyFair Elite | South Carolina\n\nESPNW ranking: 22\n\nMcDowell fits the \"3 and D\" mold that makes her a valuable wing/forward prospect. She can play on the perimeter and get physical inside. She is a high-level rebounder and does all of the glue things a team needs at that spot. She spent some time with the Brazilian national team at the U18 FIBA Americas tournament this summer, and she came back more assertive and confident attacking off the bounce.\n\nShe will be a forward who can stretch the floor out beyond the 3-point line for Dawn Staley at South Carolina. McDowell's no-nonsense, mature approach to the game should set her up to contribute early in Columbia.\n\nF Brynn McGaughy\n\n6-2 | Central Valley HS (Washington) | Meta Hoops | Washington\n\nESPNW ranking: 21\n\nMcGaughy is a springy and strong forward from a small town in Washington who sought out elite competition, took what she learned from that experience and went to work to reach for her potential. McGaughy has a broad frame to complement her ability to elevate and finish. She has good hands and can catch and finish in traffic, which also allows her to show her elite ballhandling ability, something unique for the forwards of the game. She plays out of the face-up and jab very well, and also will seal and punish a smaller defender with her back to the basket. McGaughy's range has to be respected beyond the 3-point line as well, making her a tough cover.\n\nAs McGaughy is surrounded by other gifted players day in and day out at Washington, look for her defensive prowess to increase and production to follow when she gets on campus with Tina Langley.\n\nPG Aliyahna Morris\n\n5-5 | Etiwanda HS (California) | Cal Sparks | Cal\n\nESPNW ranking: 24\n\nMorris is a stocky, quiet, lead-by-example point guard. She goes about her business without trying to draw a lot of attention -- just does what it takes to win. She sets the tone with consistent ball pressure defensively and sets the table for teammates to make plays. Over time, Morris improved her long-range shooting, and her pull-up has always been a nice weapon, making her floor game much more efficient. She won an EYBL championship with the Cal Sparks and Etiwanda teammate Grace Knox in 2023 as well as multiple CIF state championships.\n\nPG Mia Pauldo\n\n5-5 | Morris Catholic (New Jersey) | Hurban Legends | Tennessee\n\nESPNW ranking: 11\n\nThe heart with which Pauldo plays is captivating and impossible to miss. She might be a small guard, but she backs down from no challenge. Pauldo is an entertaining playmaker, especially in transition. She keeps the defense honest with a high-percentage 3-point shot, which she can create off the bounce or relocate for catch-and-shoot opportunities. She has the ball on a string and plays well out of the pick and roll. Her passion and intangibles make others better on the floor. Defensively, she is an intelligent on-ball pest and reads and reacts to the floor at an advanced level.\n\nTennessee coach Kim Caldwell is getting a signing class with a lot of accolades, and Pauldo (and her sister Mya) were the catalysts. Mia will fit in well with the press-and-pace style Caldwell has brought to Knoxville.\n\nW Deniya Prawl\n\n6-1 | IMG Academy (Florida) | B1CE | Tennessee\n\nESPNW ranking: 14\n\nPrawl is a wing who has as much upside as any player in the class. She leaps high for rebounds and can lead the break. She has enough skill to her handle to create space for the midrange jumper, and she uses angles to slash to the rim where she finishes high and with contact. She makes plays many cannot, and that has kept plenty of intrigue around her game. Consistency and perimeter shooting have been issues for Prawl, and the collegiate level will demand more of her. If she delivers, there will be a lot of return on that work investment.\n\nPG Emilee Skinner\n\n6-foot | Ridgeline HS (Utah) | Utah Prospects | Duke\n\nESPNW ranking: 7\n\nSkinner has a quiet confidence and an inner vicious competitor that shows up in big moments. Smooth with the ball as she glides up the court using more change of pace than flair, she knows how to get to her spots -- using hesitations and snatch-back dribbles to get to her patented pull-up. She has length and a strong frame, and utilizes both with an impressive finishing package. Skinner anticipates very well defensively and is learning how to use her length more to her advantage on that end. A point guard who rebounds as well as she does only to zip the ball to the other end for an easy finish for a teammate -- who wouldn't want her on their team?\n\nSkinner was also recently named as a guard to the Nike Hoop Summit USA team. She will give Kara Lawson the most elite point guard she has had since she took over the Duke program, and it will be a piece that fits well as Duke has young talented wings and forwards waiting in Cameron Indoor Stadium.\n\nF Lara Somfai\n\n6-4 | IMG Academy (Florida) | FBC United | Stanford\n\nESPNW ranking: 16\n\nSomfai is an agile and powerful forward from Australia who spent the past two seasons at IMG when she was not representing the Australian national team. She has impeccable footwork around the rim and a shooter's touch with a high release well beyond the 3-point line. Somfai is comfortable in face-up situations and sees the floor well -- making timely passes in the half court or advancing the ball after a rebound.\n\nBringing elite international experience as a stretch forward to Kate Paye and Stanford will prove dividends in Palo Alto in the near future.\n\nG/W Jordan Speiser\n\n6-1 | Lutheran HS (Missouri) | All Iowa Attack | Kansas State\n\nESPNW ranking: 10\n\nSpeiser is the best long-range shooter in this class. She had a summer of incredible shooting performances, including a 40-point game in the EYBL Championship tournament. Always known as a shooting threat since she hit the circuit, Speiser went to work and improved her handle and ability to sustain contact going to the rim, and it proved valuable last summer as she countered hard closeouts and was crowded and closely guarded. She has a strong frame and knows how to draw fouls to get to the free throw line.\n\nSpeiser was also named to the Nike Hoop Summit squad. She will be a valuable commodity to Jeff Mittie and the Kansas State program. The Wildcats space the floor and know how to use shooters, and she will be a fan favorite.\n\nPG Hailee Swain\n\n5-10 | Holy Innocents' (Georgia) | Team Elite | Stanford\n\nESPNW ranking: 9\n\nSwain is a lefty guard who brings an electricity to the floor with her intensity defensively and how much pressure she puts on the paint offensively. She has a handle that allows her to dance by defenders to create plays. She is adept at finishing with the left and right hands out to about 12 feet with floaters and short jumpers -- something very rare. She has improved her 3-point shot over time, and she keeps defenders guessing as she changes pace in the half court.\n\nWith her USA Basketball gold medal experience, it is no surprise Swain was named to the Nike Hoop Summit squad as well. She will bring a dynamic element to the Stanford perimeter, which will serve the Cardinal well in the varied style of the ACC.",

TACO in a post-show interview. \"Then we put a date on it. Then it came by so quickly, and we weren\u2019t ready for it, so we put another date on it and finally pulled it off.\"\n\nThe band first posted a flyer with art depicting punks climbing all over the golden arches last week on their Instagram account, teasing about playing at a McDonald's, while not posting publicly which one it would be.\n\nFans quickly commented, wanting to know the address immediately, but the band never posted it to prevent the police from raiding it or raising suspicion among the guardians of fast food. The inspiration for this unique show came after Knuckleheadz wrote a song, titled \"Fuck McDonaldz.\"\n\nThe Knuckleheadz show at the McDonald's was attended by punks of all ages, including children singing along to their melodic hit, \"Glory Daze.\" Photo by Javier Cabral for L.A.

TACO.\n\n\"We wrote that song, 'Fuck McDonaldz,' because we all know that McDonald\u2019s is poison,\" says Tom. \"It's our version of a classic punk song against a corporation.\"\n\nHe says he was inspired by other anti-McDonald's punk anthems, like \"Corporate Deathburger,\" by Millions of Dead Cops and \"McAnarchy,\" by Narcoleptic Youth.\n\nThe band originated in Whittier in 2023 and was formed by 32-year-old Tom Knucklehead, who sings, along with members Randy \u201cGrateful\u201d on bass, Vamps on co-vocals, Fritz on guitar, Sauce on second guitar, and Zach \"Too Nice\" on drums.\n\nThe band members all train in Tom Knucklehead's gym in Whittier, Knucklehead Martial Arts. All of them are also members of Tom's Punk Rock Fight Club, a community of punk rock fighters who meet weekly to train and lift weights.\n\nTom is a two-time Muay Thai champion, a professional MMA fighter, and a state-certified personal trainer with his own protein supplement line. He is also a professional skateboarder who recently blew up in the skating world with a video published on YouTube by Dabble Video Magazine. Recently, Knuckelheadz opened up for headliners such as N8NOFACE and Foos Gone Wild, and also played a club show at Punk Rock Bowling last year.\n\nKnuckleheadz pit was friendly, but there was one person who suffered a gash on their face. Photo by Javier Cabral for L.A. TACO.\n\nMost of the fans in attendance were members of Knucklehead Tom's \"Punk Rock Fight Club.\" Photo by Javier Cabral for L.A. TACO.\n\nThese shows prepared him for his biggest show yet, held inside a McDonald's dining room with at least a hundred screaming fans singing along to his lyrics. The band also documented the performance.\n\n\u201cI was nervous and anxious about it; feed off that feeling because that\u2019s what being alive is about, you know?,\" he tells L.A. TACO. \"You don\u2019t want it to lead you, but fuel you.\"\n\nThe nerves started kicking in when Tom and his Knuckleheadz band showed up at the first scouted McDonald's close to U.S.C. and saw cops eating there. So they went to another one.\n\nHe got further stressed when another nearby McDonald's at a gas station appeared much too small to house a relentless street punk performance. Especially one with a full band and a caravan of over 20 cars, full of eager punks ready to get in the pit and sing along to the anti-McDonald's anthem.\n\nOther McDonald's locations in the vicinity had armed security guards. Tom wasn't going to risk endangering the lives of his band or his fans. Then, one of Tom\u2019s scouts found the perfect McDonald's on Slauson and Central.\n\nEstevan Oriol shooting Knucklehead Tom after the show. Photo by Javier Cabral for L.A.

TACO.\n\nThe flash mob of more than 100 punks, of all ages and backgrounds, showed up at the chosen McDonald's, and not even ten minutes after arriving, the Knuckleheads casually walked in, set up their drum kit, plugged into their rechargeable speakers, and went off. Famed photographer Estevan Oriol, who is a friend of Tom's, showed up to shoot the show, as well.\n\n\"What the fuck is up, McDonald's?!\" Tom yelled into the mic before the band immediately went into performing their \"Fuck McDonaldz.\" A pit broke out as soon as the first power chord was played.\n\nAfter playing \"Fuck McDonaldz\" two times in a row, the Knuckleheadz played two more songs, including their street punk song, \"Fighting Solves Everything.\"\n\nA fan dressed up as Ronald McDonald, as well as multiple children and two dogs, were present in the pit, singing along to the melodic Knuckleheadz hit, \"Glory Dayz,\" and crowd surfing during the set.\n\nThe concert lasted less than 20 minutes. 30 minutes later, everyone who attended was outside high-fiving and taking photos. The dining room looked undisturbed, exactly as it was before the impromptu punk rock show took place.\n\nWhen asked if Tom would play at a McDonald's again, he responds, \"I think we'll play a show like this again. I'm just grateful it all happened so smoothly, even the employees came out to record the show on their phones!\u201d\n\nKnuckleheadz are playing a show with The Exploited in Murrieta on February 28th and also performing at Nacho Corrupted's Punk Invasion on March 15th. Follow them on Instagram to see if they are playing another McDonald's soon.",

The contest in 2021 did not take place due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so McKenney could become the first U-M signee to play in the All-Star game since Daniel Horton in 2002.\n\nCurrently rated the 17th overall recruit in the nation and a five-star recruit, McKenney is the highest-rated in-state prospect in the 2025 class. Despite battling injuries this season, he is a frontrunner for Michigan's Mr. Basketball. This year, he broke Orchard Lake St. Mary's all-time leading scorer record of 1,688 points, including a 37-point, standout performance in a narrow loss to IMG Academy (Fla.).\n\nAs a junior, McKenney was named the 2024 Michigan Associated Press Division 1 Basketball Player of the Year for the second straight year, averaging a double-double of 22.8 points and 10.1 rebounds per game en route to winning the Division 1 State Championship. In the championship game, he had 32 points and grabbed 10 rebounds.\n\nOn the international front, McKenney averaged a team second-best 10.8 points per game for Team USA at the 2024 FIBA U18 AmeriCup, helping lead the team to a gold medal.\n\nThe McDonald's All-American Game will take place in the Barclay Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Tuesday, April 1.\n\nMichigan's McDonald's All-Americans\n\nTim McCormick (1980)\n\nEric Turner (1981)\n\nRichard Rellford (1982)\n\nAntoine Joubert (1983)\n\nGary Grant (1984)\n\nRumeal Robinson, Terry Mills (1986)\n\nSean Higgins (1987)\n\nJuwan Howard, Jimmy King, Jalen Rose, Chris Webber (1991)\n\nBobby Crawford (1993)\n\nWillie Mitchell, Jerod Ward (1994)\n\nLouis Bullock, Robert Traylor, Albert White (1995)\n\nLaVell Blanchard (1999)\n\nDaniel Horton (2002)\n\nKobe Bufkin, Moussa Diabate, Caleb Houstan (2021)\n\nTrey McKenney (2025)",

This year's McDonald's All-American Game will take place at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on April 1 at 3 p.m. PT and will be televised on ESPN2.The 2025 rosters were based on competitive criteria and chosen from a list of several hundred nominees by some of the nation's top analysts, prep scouts, media and coaches.

Dybantsa is the first BYU pledge to make the McDonald's All-American game since Garner Meads in 2000. The annual showcase for the nation's top high school players will take place April 1 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and features a heavy-hitting class of future studs, including five-stars like Darryn Peterson (Kansas) and Cameron Boozer (Duke) who are primed to give Dybantsa a heated run to go No. 1 overall in the highly-anticipated 2026 NBA Draft.\n\nBoozer was one of three future Blue Devils to make the cut, including his brother, Cayden, and the sweet-shooting Nikolas Khamenia. The Boozer brothers are following in the footsteps of their dad, Carlos, who was a McDonald's All-American selection in 1999.\n\nUConn, the two-time defending champions, will be well-represented by Braylon Mullins, Eric Reibe and Darius Adams. Overall, 14 total schools will be represented in the McDonald's All-American game, and there are oodles of storylines emerging, including numerous first-year coaches making real splashes. Even in a new place, Arkansas' John Calipari continues to bring in top players. Dazzling point guard Darius Acuff Jr. and stud wing Meleek Thomas are two Arkansas signees who earned the nod. Arkansas and Houston joined Duke and UConn as the only other programs with multiple hoopers selected.\n\nTwo National Coach of the Year contenders will get even more shine. Kentucky's Mark Pope reeled in big man Malachi Moreno who made the cut. Pat Kelsey has Louisville humming both on the court and on the recruiting trail with five-star point guard Mikel Brown Jr.. Plus, Washington's Danny Sprinkle will have McDonald's All-American Niko Bundalo headlining his first true recruiting haul, and Jalen Haralson, the jewel of Notre Dame coach Micah Shrewsberry's historic recruiting class, is on his way to Brooklyn, too. Haralson is the top-rated player to ever pick Notre Dame in the modern era.\n\nThe star-studded crop also features four ballyhooed five-stars who have not made decisions. Nate Ament is the top name of that quartet. The sleek scoring wing is ranked No. 4 in the Class of 2025, per 247Sports, and owns one of the highest ceilings in the class. Fellow five-stars like Koa Peat, Alijah Arenas and Brayden Burries are also making coaching staffs sweat ahead of their various Decision Days.\n\n2025 McDonald's All-American Game rosters\n\nEast\n\nF Shon Abaev, Cincinnati\n\nG Darius Acuff Jr., Arkansas\n\nG Darius Adams, UConn\n\nF Nate Ament, undecided\n\nF Cameron Boozer, Duke\n\nG Cayden Boozer, Duke\n\nF Jalen Haralson, Notre Dame\n\nG Isiah Harwell, Houston\n\nG Trey McKenney, Michigan\n\nC Malachi Moreno, Kentucky\n\nG Braylon Mullins, UConn\n\nC Eric Reibe, UConn\n\nWest",

AFP via Getty Images\n\nGrijabla was in court the day after his arrest and is currently fighting his extradition to the US, where he could face a long jail sentence, the Sun reported.\n\nCosta Rica\u2019s Attorney General Carlo Diaz praised the DEA\u2019s arrest but noted his office did not have any charges against Grijabla.\n\n\u201cFor us it is also an important capture, because we had not yet been able to attribute any criminal act to him in our country, but I repeat, he has been linked in some investigations to drug trafficking in Lim\u00f3n,\u201d D\u00edaz, according to Teletica.\n\nThe international capture divided officials in the country, with President Rodrigo Chaves Robles and security Minister Mario Zamora questioning the OIJ.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous that the Costa Rican police, I mean the Judicial Investigation Agency, the Judiciary and the Attorney General\u2019s Office, with everyone knowing what Shock does, do not even have an open case against him, while the gringos leave the country and capture him in London. What do the gringos have that the OIJ does not have? Is it decency?\u201d Chaves questioned, according to La Teja.\n\n4 Rodriguez\u2019s lavish social vacation posts to social media helped law enforcement track down her husband. Estefania McDonald Rodriguez/Facebook\n\nZ\u00fa\u00f1iga rebutted saying the DEA had an incentive to capture the people suspected of harming its country\u2019s citizens.\n\n\u201cThere is an investment. The rulers are crystal clear that the DEA is very important to prevent the scourge of drugs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe OIJ director said his American counterparts were also better invested and had access to technology to open phones",

Sure, the fast food chain serves up some tasty burgers, crispy fries, uniquely battered nuggets, and dreamy McFlurrys (when its ice cream machines are working). But, overall, the chain is most known for its convenience, low prices, and quick service, not Michelin star level food. However, in 2021, the chain challenged this notion, by teaming up with Paul Cunningham, a two-star Michelin chef. Cunningham is an English born chef who works primarily in Denmark, where his two-star Michelin establishment is located. His culinary philosophy elevates tradition in food rather than keeping to what is trendy, a philosophy that he carried over to his work with the golden arches.\n\nMcDonald's and Cunningham released its collaborative burger in January of 2021. The burger was called The Homestyle Bearnaise, and it featured a beef patty topped with potato sticks, lettuce, cheddar cheese, a smoked onion puree, and, of course, a delicious B\u00e9arnaise sauce. Now, you wouldn't be amiss in not recalling such a unique collaboration, as this burger was only released in Denmark. However, though the collaboration was relegated to one market, it did stir up quite the controversy in the culinary field, with some chefs, including Christian Puglisi, expressing their distaste for the collaboration online.",

Courtesy/Laredo Police Department\n\nThe Laredo Police Department began 2025 with its first Coffee with a Cop event of the year last weekend, bringing community members together at McDonald\u2019s on Santa Ursula Avenue to foster dialogue and build partnerships over a cup of coffee.\n\nThis monthly event, led by LPD Sgt. Jonathan Castillo, aims to strengthen relationships between law enforcement and residents by emphasizing transparency and mutual understanding.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThe main goal with Coffee with a Cop is to have conversations with community members over a cup of coffee as to how we can better serve the community,\u201d Castillo said. \u201cWe want to hear the good and the bad as to what are some things we can do as a department to ensure the safety of the community. The best way to progress is to involve everybody.\u201d\n\nCoffee with a Cop was first conceived in 2011 by the Hawthorne Police Department in California as a way to bridge the growing gap between police and the public caused by shifting demographics and communication methods. Today, the initiative spans all 50 states and has crossed borders into countries such as Canada, Australia and others, proving its effectiveness in breaking down barriers through informal settings.\n\n\u201cThe community is one of the biggest stakeholders because everything that we do affects them directly. There are more community members than there are police officers,\u201d Castillo said. \u201cWho better to hear feedback from than the community itself? That\u2019s what all this is really about \u2014 building that relationship, having that sense of community and belonging and letting them know that what they say matters to us.\u201d\n\nAccording to Castillo, Coffee with a Cop goes beyond casual conversations by addressing actionable community feedback. Residents mention issues such as rehoming stray animals, repaving streets, installing lights around neighborhood parks and adding speed bumps. He said that by partnering with local government and agencies such as the Texas Department of Transportation, the LPD serves as a link between the community and those entities.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe program\u2019s success is evident not only in the attendance numbers but also in the familiar faces Castillo sees each month, especially among the elderly. Because of Laredo\u2019s proximity to the Mexico border, visitors who stumble upon a Coffee with a Cop event often compliment the police department\u2019s outreach efforts.\n\n\u201cI personally take the opportunity to sit with them and hear them out,\u201d Castillo said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s something I can address then and there or something that\u2019s going to take time to enforce, giving them that time and having open ears gives them a sense of being heard. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nCastillo expressed gratitude to the staff at all the McDonald\u2019s locations where they hold their monthly events, as well as his LPD team.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cNothing here would be possible without my team,\u201d Castillo said. \u201cI have a great team of officers who really push this event. It\u2019s great. We enjoy doing this. We love being out here interacting with the community.\u201d",

I wanted to use the photos to draw people in, people who would normally not read or even care about social anthropology and make that accessible to them via colorful photos or photos of extraordinary locations.\u201d\n\nThis McDonald\u2019s in Guatemala City was built in the shape of a Happy Meal to recognize an early version of the iconic kids meal that originated in the country. McBaguette sandwiches are seen in a makeshift studio in Paris. They were first launched as a limited-time offering in 2012.\n\nRather than analyzing McDonald\u2019s from the perspective of a cool, detached academic, He is firstly a fan.\n\nUpon arriving in a new city, He would go into a local McDonald\u2019s and hang back for a bit, seeing what the most popular orders were. Then, he\u2019d order a bunch of items himself and take them to his hotel room to lay them out and photograph them \u2014 and, eventually, eat.\n\nHe\u2019s lifelong relationship with McDonald\u2019s forms the spine of his story. There\u2019s a picture of him as a child riding a Filet-O-Fish rocker in the kids\u2019 play place at his neighborhood Mickey D\u2019s in Brooklyn that he chose for his author photo, and he says he survived off of double cheeseburgers and chicken fajitas from the chain during his college years at New York University.\n\nBut McDonald\u2019s, of course, is much more than a fast-food joint.\n\nDepending who you ask, it is an avatar for capitalism at its most insidious, a master class in branding that should be studied in every business school, and a representative of Western outsiders making inroads into rural areas and pushing out local establishments.\n\nThe early 2000s were a watershed time for examining America\u2019s relationship with fast food \u2014 McDonald\u2019s in particular.\n\nThe McArabia Chicken is a pita sandwich sold in Middle Eastern markets. McSpaghetti was introduced in the Philippines in 1986. These Viennese pastries are from a McCafe in Austria. The Big Spicy McWrap Paneer is seen in a studio in New Delhi.\n\nEric Schlosser\u2019s book \u201cFast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal\u201d was published in 2001. The Morgan Spurlock documentary \u201cSuper Size Me,\u201d where the filmmaker vowed to eat nothing but McDonald\u2019s foods for 30 days and document how it affected his health, came out in 2004.\n\nBoth led to major changes at fast-food brands, like the introduction of cheap salads alongside the burgers and fries.\n\nBut He points out that McDonald\u2019s didn\u2019t become a global powerhouse by only imposing American tastes on the rest of the world.\n\nThis McDonald\u2019s in Ein Bokek, Israel, is at the edge of the Dead Sea and is the chain\u2019s lowest-elevation restaurant, He said. This McDonald\u2019s opened in the Nyugati train station in Budapest, Hungary, in 1990.\n\n\u201cThe American chain is now the mechanism upon which these other countries\u2019 cultural items are being disseminated around the world and how people are discovering and eating it. That can't be discounted.\u201d\n\nThe chain likes to incorporate local flavors and ingredients onto its menu, from McGyros in Greece to McBaguettes in France.\n\n\u201cYou don't build the largest restaurant chain in the world off the back of tourists,\u201d says He. \u201cIt's the locals and what they need and want.\u201d\n\nOne example is the McSpaghetti in the Philippines. One of the country\u2019s most popular meals is spaghetti with banana ketchup, and McDonald\u2019s knew that if they wanted to compete with local Filipino fast-food establishments, it would have to make a version of the spaghetti itself.\n\nMeanwhile, the McArabia, commonly found in McDonald\u2019s outlets across the Middle East, is a mass-produced version of the chicken pita sandwich many observant Muslims like to eat to break their Ramadan fasts.\n\nIn India, there are a wealth of vegetarian options to cater to the many non-meat-eating locals, and Australia\u2019s McDonald\u2019s have sourced their coffee from some of the same producers as the upscale cafes where residents get their flat whites.\n\nThis McDonald\u2019s in Milan, Italy, is directly across from the Duomo cathedral. The first McDonald\u2019s in Malaysia was built at the Bukit Bintang Crossing in Kuala Lumpur. You can actually eat inside a decommissioned Douglas DC-3 airplane at this McDonald\u2019s in Taup\u014d, New Zealand. China\u2019s first McDonald\u2019s was built in 1990, inside the central shopping district of Shenzhen.\n\nHe believes that the egg bulgogi burger in South Korea McDonald\u2019s is the most delicious menu item in the world.\n\nAlthough \u201cMcAtlas\u201d is a kind of love letter, it wasn\u2019t one received by its recipient.\n\nHe says that despite numerous attempts to contact McDonald\u2019s corporate offices, the brand wasn\u2019t interested in being involved with the book project.\n\n\u201cMcDonald's has not authorized or associated with this project at all. They didn't fund it. Nothing. This is an independent work of journalism,\u201d he says.\n\nChurros are photographed in a studio in Istanbul. The largest McDonald\u2019s in the Middle East, He said, is this one at the base of the Kuwait Towers in Kuwait City.\n\nDue to the independent nature of the project, He spent several years working on it off and on, returning to New York to take on other work in order to be able to fund his travels.\n\nAnd although the book is completed and published, he isn\u2019t sure it will ever really be done.\n\n\u201cMcDonald's is (an) ever-changing, ever-evolving restaurant. Even in the course of the time that I've been working on this project, major things have happened to McDonald's around the world,\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cMcDonald's has always been a part of my life. And it's an honor and a joy to be able to see what role McDonald's plays in other people's lives around the world.\u201d",

It\u2019s a trend we\u2019re monitoring closely.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cWEC Effect\u201d Report\n\nTo quantify the WEC\u2019s impact on vacant land values, SVN McDonald & Co. conducted an in-depth analysis of over 300 land transactions from the past six years, focusing on properties near the WEC\u2019s Grand Outdoor Arena. The findings reveal a compelling trend: land values increase significantly the closer they are to the WEC.\n\nKey Findings from the Report:\n\n200%+ Increase in Vacant Land Values: Land prices in the area have skyrocketed since the WEC\u2019s opening.\n\nIncrease in Vacant Land Values: Land prices in the area have skyrocketed since the WEC\u2019s opening. Average Parcel Size: 54.57 acres.\n\n2023 Prices: $143,117 per acre at the top end and $10,974 per acre at the bottom end.\n\nat the top end and at the bottom end. Proximity Matters: The WEC\u2019s influence on property values extends up to 15 miles from its center.\n\nWhy Ocala? Natural Advantages for Equestrian Use\n\nBeyond the WEC, Ocala\u2019s land offers unique advantages for equestrian enthusiasts. The area\u2019s limestone-rich bedrock produces nutrient-dense No. 8 soil, rich in calcium, which enhances pasture grass quality. This results in stronger bones and better muscle function for grazing horses. Combined with Ocala\u2019s mild winters, which provide year-round training opportunities and superior footing, these factors cement the region\u2019s reputation as a premier destination for serious equestrians.\n\nAbout SVN McDonald & Co.\n\nFor over 20 years, SVN McDonald & Co. has guided families and investors through complex land and commercial real estate transactions in Ocala and Marion County. The \u201cWEC Effect\u201d report offers insights into the evolving real estate market, highlighting dramatic land value changes over the past six years.",

Some of the players joined him in the chant, but the results were a little mixed for something that has become a calling card at Greyhound games under McDonald\u2019s tenure.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat\u2019s OK: It\u2019s not the varsity squad McDonald is coaching today. These are fifth graders. It\u2019s 10:30 on a Saturday morning.

Jed Carlson / Duluth Media Group\n\nAlmost as soon as he started coaching Duluth East more than 12 years ago, McDonald started to organize a travel youth program, which became the East Basketball Association.\n\nThirty years ago, middle school basketball programs were the feeder programs for the varsity and junior varsity teams.\n\nDuluth East coach Rhett McDonald questions a call during his fifth-grade team\u2019s game with Superior during the Winter City Showdown at East High School on Saturday, Dec. 14, 2024. Jed Carlson / Duluth Media Group\n\n\u201cOnce the 2000s came around, we saw tons of budget cuts all over the place,\u201d McDonald said.\n\nOne of the places that saw those cuts were middle school basketball programs. At the time McDonald took over the Greyhounds, the Duluth Area Youth Basketball Association was overseeing the youth basketball program.\n\nMcDonald saw a need to establish a \u201cspecific program at East as soon as we possibly could.\u201d\n\nSince starting with maybe 20 kids in the program, EBA has grown to include almost 100 kids \u2014 enough to run a day of games with several other local feeder programs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSubscribers Only Prep Local basketball referees celebrate 50 years on the court Steve Olson, Jim Erzar and Jerry Ujdur combined for more than 150 years of officiating experience in the Twin Ports.\n\n\u201cEven though we\u2019re in the largest class, we\u2019re not Wayzata, we\u2019re not Eden Prairie,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cWe don\u2019t just get to show up and start coaching kids when they\u2019re freshmen \u2014 we have to do things differently.\u201d\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s get a turkey\u2019\n\nDuluth East head basketball coach Rhett McDonald, left, leans to the side with his 5th grade travel team as they watch the final free throw of their game with Northwestern at Superior Middle School in November 2024. Jed Carlson / Duluth Media Group\n\nThe EBA teams try to use much of the same terminology they\u2019ll hear when they move up into the high school program and makes McDonald the perfect guy to design it.\n\nFifth-grade Greyhounds will listen to the McDonald preach about \u201cgrit and grind\u201d \u2014 the philosophy of a hard-nosed, working man\u2019s brand of basketball made popular by the Memphis Grizzlies more than a decade ago. They\u2019ll also hear McDonald use terms like the \u201cKobe move\u201d or get the kids into a \u201c\u2018D\u2019 up\u201d chant on the bench, something that will be second nature by the time they reach high school.\n\nSometimes, however, a few modifications are needed.\n\n\u201cAlright, now let\u2019s get a turkey,\u201d McDonald yelled across the court after a defensive stop.\n\nA \u201cturkey\u201d \u2014 for those that haven\u2019t been to a bowling alley lately \u2014 is when someone rolls three strikes in a row. That\u2019s the EBA term for three consecutive stops, but the boys in high school get something a little different.\n\n\u201cAt the high school level, we actually call them kills, but we\u2019re not going to be that violent at that level,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cSo we think that if we can get a certain amount of turkeys in the game, it\u2019s usually going to allow us to win.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDuluth East coach Rhett McDonald, left, holds onto the jersey of his fifth-grade son, Ganon McDonald (25), before he checks into the Greyhounds game with Superior during the Winter City Showdown at East High School on Saturday morning, Dec. 14, 2024. Jed Carlson / Duluth Media Group\n\nStill, the nomenclature is relatively consistent throughout the entire program.\n\n\u201cWe talk Kobe move,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cKobe move for us means you\u2019re going to go one way, hard, until they stop you and then you counter. Kids at these ages just dribble, dribble, dribble because that\u2019s what they see on TV, but they\u2019ll hear Kobe move in third grade and they\u2019ll hear Kobe move when they are seniors in high school.\u201d\n\nMore importantly, McDonald is building relationships that will become instrumental as the boys grow into high school players. Those connections go both ways, according to Duluth East assistant Damien Paulson. His sons, Noah and Rocco, played their way through the EBA and the varsity program. Noah is currently a redshirt junior at Minnesota Duluth and Rocco is a sophomore at Wisconsin-Superior.\n\nPaulson said a robust, streamlined youth program like the EBA is essential to a successful program. It creates a connection between varsity players \u2014 who are often working scoreboards or officiating the youth games \u2014 and the younger players. More importantly, it\u2019s vital for the varsity coach to be as involved as he is.\n\n\u201cTo me, that\u2019s how a program is made \u2014 they should know each other,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cAnd the varsity coach shouldn\u2019t be on this pedestal that nobody gets to know until they\u2019re there. Rhett\u2019s done a good job of breaking that barrier down as far as our youth.\u201d\n\nThe idea behind it all is to nurture a love of basketball and competition and that practice is not a \u201cchore,\u201d McDonald said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re already thinking about college basketball or stuff like that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we can get them to generally love the experience of playing \u2014 whether they\u2019re the best player or not \u2014 I think that\u2019s the overall goal.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018Basketball is the hobby\u2019\n\nDuluth East coach Rhett McDonald coaches up one of his fifth-grade players during their game in the Winter City Showdown at East High School on Saturday, Dec. 14, 2024. Jed Carlson / Duluth Media Group\n\nPerhaps the biggest thing the youth program and varsity program have in common is the time McDonald spends on both.\n\nOn a Monday night in November, McDonald held his opening practice for the high school program for two hours at Duluth East. He went straight from the high school gym to Ordean East Middle School for a youth practice.\n\nEach week, McDonald estimates he spends about 4.5 hours on youth basketball, in addition to daily varsity practices, two to three games a week \u2014 often requiring a significant road trip \u2014 and regular film sessions.\n\nDuluth East\u2019s Ganon McDonald (25) passes around the Northwestern defense during a November tournament in Superior. Jed Carlson / Duluth Media Group\n\nIt does take a lot of time for a father of three that also teaches history full-time, but his wife, Kayelyn McDonald, encourages him to coach the younger kids.\n\n\u201cI think she knows I would be miserable if I wasn\u2019t,\u201d McDonald said.\n\nMcDonald loves coaching, but if there is anyone who can claim to have coaching in their blood, it\u2019s someone with the last name McDonald. His grandfather, Bob McDonald, is the winningest high school coach in Minnesota history. His dad, Mike McDonald, and all five of Mike\u2019s siblings, are or have spent significant time coaching.\n\nHis younger sister Kailee Olson is an assistant with the Duluth East girls team and his brother Kyle McDonald is the head coach at Forest Lake. Basketball is a way of life for the McDonalds.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBack in the day before everything was on film, I remember countless times going scouting with my day,\u201d he said.\n\nMike McDonald talks to his Cambridge-Isanti summer team during the 2024 Twin Ports Summer Jam basketball tournament at Ordean East Middle School. Jamey Malcomb / Duluth Media Group\n\nWhile Mike, the head boys coach at Cambridge-Isanti, doesn\u2019t remember \u201cscouting\u201d with his dad, spending time in the gym was a constant for his brother Paul McDonald and himself. They also made a tradition of getting a hotel room and going to the state boys basketball tournament.\n\n\u201cWe did that with my dad growing up and we still continue that,\u201d Mike said. \u201cLast year, all of my kids and I stayed in a hotel down on University Avenue near Williams Arena where most of the tournament was at and we just hung out there as a family.\u201d\n\nMike said he\u2019s only missed a handful of tournaments over the years, all of them when he was coaching and teaching in South Dakota. His dad\u2019s dedication to basketball \u2014 and including his kids in his passion \u2014 is reflected with McDonald\u2019s relationship with his own children. Often Ganon, Dekker and McKinli can come to away games or even ride the bus on road trips.\n\nSports Duluth East coach's son recovering after cycling injury Seven-year-old Ganon McDonald suffered a traumatic brain injury Friday after a spill on the Willard Munger State Trail, an accident that required immediate surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain.\n\n\u201cThose things we did together, it gives me a reminder of how to parent when you\u2019re so immersed in your own coaching,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cI have to find ways to include my own kids as much as I can into our high school stuff.\u201d\n\nWhile it all takes a ton of time, \u201cbasketball is the hobby,\u201d according to McDonald, and seeing kids learn and grow is what makes it all worth it.\n\n\u201cWhen you see kids working collectively to try to achieve a common goal at the fourth- and fifth-grade level, that\u2019s really cool,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes the sacrifice of time a lot more enjoyable \u2014 and it\u2019s fun. I don\u2019t go golfing, I don\u2019t go fishing, I don\u2019t go hiking.

            "content": "Several years ago, my dad was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. The news was a shock. At 84 years old, Daddy had been dedicated to his physical health for decades. He played tennis twice a week, ate my mother\u2019s low-fat meals, and spent lots of time outdoors on their organic vegetable farm.\n\nBut the diagnosis did explain the symptoms he\u2019d been experiencing. He got out of breath more quickly. He had a cough that wouldn\u2019t go away. And he\u2019d lost so much weight, none of his old clothes fit \u2014 likely, the doctors said, because taking in less oxygen limited his exertion, thus lessening his appetite.\n\nPulmonary fibrosis is considered a progressive, terminal disease; there is no cure for the irreversible scarring of the lungs that occurs. But my dad told me not to dwell on that \u2014 and not, under any circumstances, to google it. All that mattered, he said, was that it wasn\u2019t cancer.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMaybe I will reverse it,\u201d he mused, \u201cand demonstrate that it\u2019s reversible after all!\u201d\n\nHe approached his diagnosis with his trademark jovial attitude, and I didn\u2019t doubt the sincerity of his optimism, but I had a hard time feeling it myself. The pandemic had been raging for two years, and I couldn\u2019t help but think my dad was one COVID infection away from life-threatening complications. I also found his new physical limitations hard to watch \u2014 the way he stopped to catch his breath, panting, after walking down the stairs; the rope from his tool shed now threaded through his belt loops to hold up his pants.\n\nTo slow the progression of the disease, the doctors issued a list of suggested life modifications, and my dad hated all of them. Stop mowing the hay fields? Stop heating the house with the wood stove? These activities had likely contributed to his lung scarring, doctors said, but they were also some of my dad\u2019s greatest joys.\n\nAt first, he rebelled. He bought an air purifier to offset the wood stove\u2019s impacts. He took to riding the tractor with a mask in his pocket, which he could pull out if anyone asked (none of us ever saw him wearing it).\n\nThe author's father making hay on his North Carolina farm in May 2024. Courtesy of Sara Heise Graybeal\n\nEventually, my mom used a study linking wood stove use to lung cancer in women to persuade my dad to give up this one earthly pleasure for her sake. After that, he proved slightly more open to change.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen his doctor mentioned that alcohol often worsened a secondary medical condition he was dealing with, Daddy surprised everyone by quitting immediately. The bottle of bourbon I\u2019d already chosen for his birthday sat on my shelf untouched.\n\nMy dad\u2019s lifestyle choices were trending in the right direction, but there was still one big problem: his weight.\n\nDaddy had once been 6 feet tall and 155 pounds. Now at 5 foot 8 and just 123 pounds, he weighed less than anyone else in the family. At lunch, he ate peanut butter smeared on a single slice of bread and claimed to be full. Mom pressed him to take second helpings at dinner, but she had increasing difficulty finding food he liked.\n\nFor the last four decades, my mother had sold organic fruits and vegetables at a local farmer\u2019s market and assembled them into fresh meals for her family. She taught my brother and me to eschew fast food, reject sodas and always opt for low-fat milk and ice cream. When we played away soccer games in high school, our parents came to watch but refused to eat at the Arby\u2019s or KFC or Golden Corral that everyone else headed to after the game.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too depressing in there,\u201d they told us.\n\nIf Mom was our health food leader, Daddy was her willing right-hand man. But along with the other changes his body had undergone, his taste buds also seemed to weaken around the time of his diagnosis. He no longer enjoyed salads and rice and beans the way he used to. He cared more about color and texture now, Mom noted irritably. He refused leftovers because, once in their Tupperware containers, they no longer seemed visually appealing.\n\nWith her own health issues to worry about \u2014 including high cholesterol and a predisposition for diabetes \u2014 Mom kept cooking the same plant-based meals she always had, and continued trying to convince Daddy to eat larger portions of them. But he remained stubborn, and the risk his low weight presented felt increasingly dire.\n\nThe author's mother and father in Pittsboro, North Carolina. Courtesy of Sara Heise Graybeal\n\nI was torn over this food dilemma. On one hand, my dad was far too skinny, and everyone agreed this was now the most urgent medical issue to address. On the other hand, was it my mom\u2019s responsibility to fix it?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI started cooking beef stews and chicken casseroles on the weekend and driving them down to my parents\u2019 farm. This way, my mom could keep eating her vegetables, and my dad could load up on fat and protein. However, this fix was unsustainable \u2014 as a working mom of a toddler, my schedule was far from predictable. Any bump in the road meant it could be several weeks before I had time to take my dad more meals.\n\nThe solution came so quietly and unexpectedly that, at first, we missed it. One day at lunchtime, my dad was driving home from playing tennis with some friends and felt an unusual sensation \u2014 hunger. A McDonald\u2019s just north of our town had opened up several years before, but no one in our family had ever stopped there. Now, as he saw the restaurant\u2019s giant yellow M glinting in the sun ahead of him, Daddy felt a strangely powerful urge to stop. He pulled in, parked his car, and did something he\u2019d never done before: ordered Chicken McNuggets and fries.\n\nDaddy drove home slowly, his meal open in the passenger seat, savoring the extravagant taste of this new food.\n\n\u201cReady for lunch?\u201d Mom asked when he arrived.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI picked something up on the way,\u201d Daddy told her, and, imagining his typical granola bar or pack of peanut butter crackers, she sighed.\n\nTwo days later, Daddy did it again. Sitting at McDonald\u2019s, sunlight spilling in through the window, he worked through McNuggets, French fries and the New York Times headlines on his phone. Despite his tennis loss that morning, he came home cheerful. Mom couldn\u2019t figure it out.\n\nA few days after that, Daddy decided that the only thing that could make McDonald\u2019s taste even better was to eat it in his favorite chair at the head of the dining room table. So he ordered his meal to go, brought the bag home, and unveiled his McNuggets and fries in front of my mom, who was crunching her salad. She was predictably disgusted. But as the salty grease flooded his mouth, he found he didn\u2019t really care.\n\nDaddy\u2019s juicy story made its way around the family. After 37 years of eating chickpeas, kale and tofu, he had found his way to McDonald\u2019s. Tickled, I took my son to the drive-thru to see what all the fuss was about. We got enough takeout for all of us and unloaded it onto my parents\u2019 dining room table.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMom, tight-lipped, tipped leftover quinoa into a bowl. Daddy, delighted, accepted his large carton of fries.\n\nI watched Mom\u2019s face as we chowed down in front of her. I knew how difficult this might be for her. She had labored so diligently to feed us well for so many years, and now we seemed to be throwing her hard work back in her face.\n\nBut I also saw a softening \u2014 a brightening. She didn\u2019t have to make dinner that night, and after so many evenings in the kitchen, that was a blessing.\n\nThe author's father enjoying his birthday cake in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, in September 2023. Courtesy of Sara Heise Graybeal\n\nThe bigger blessing came at my dad\u2019s next doctor\u2019s appointment, where he learned he\u2019d gained 10 pounds. \u201cYou\u2019re on the right track!\u201d his doctor cheered.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut here\u2019s the thing,\u201d said Mom. \u201cDoes it matter how he\u2019s gaining the weight?\u201d\n\nDaddy grimaced at her.\n\n\u201cTo be frank,\u201d the doctor replied, \u201cthe man\u2019s 87. He could be eating chocolate bars all day and I\u2019d be OK with it. Whatever he\u2019s doing, he needs to stay the course.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing Mom respects, it\u2019s a doctor\u2019s orders. So Daddy kept going to McDonald\u2019s. Mom kept making her salads. And while his battle with pulmonary fibrosis continued, I slowly stopped worrying that a common cold would knock Daddy sideways. The day he unstrung the rope from his belt loops \u2014 and his pants didn\u2019t fall \u2014 we all cheered.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy son and I aren\u2019t McDonald\u2019s converts. Unlike Daddy, we don\u2019t go two or three times a week. But once my son got a taste of the PlayPlace, I knew we\u2019d be back at least occasionally. I have to admit, their Big Breakfast tastes surprisingly good on a Sunday morning, and a mouthful of hot fries after a soccer defeat does lift our spirits somehow.\n\nI\u2019d never say that fast food is the cure for all \u2014 or most \u2014 of life\u2019s problems, or even that it makes a great choice for a meal. Few medical professionals would prescribe a bag of grease and salt as a solution to anything. But watching the joy those McNuggets and fries brought my dad \u2014 not to mention the weight they\u2019ve helped him gain and maintain \u2014 made me rethink what I consider absolutes in my own life.\n\nMaybe there are times to ease up and experience something new. Maybe an answer to our prayers can come from the most unexpected place. It might not be a Big Mac that\u2019s going to change my \u2014 or your \u2014 life, but maybe it\u2019s something else we\u2019ve never tried. Maybe joy is waiting down the road, just beyond that offramp we\u2019ve never taken. Maybe we should try it sometime.\n\nSara Heise Graybeal is a writer and journalist with an MFA in fiction from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

What more could a fast food fan want?\n\nAim higher, say the food experts at Tasting Table, who report that TikTokkers have been lighting up the controversial social media site with a bizarre-sounding hack that\u2019s supposed to send the Golden Arches go-to over the top.\n\n3 Apparently, McDonald\u2019s chicken nuggets can be improved upon, according to a bizarre-sounding hack recently making the rounds online. Shutterstock\n\nSure, you know about the nuggets and the sauces that come with them. Some of us can probably recite the options from memory.\n\nBut you may end up kicking yourself when you reflect on how many years you\u2019ve lived without knowing how much better both components become when you mix things up a little \u2014 literally.\n\nHow the so-called upgrade works: You take a couple of the sweet and sour tubs and a packet of mayonnaise and you put it all on top of the nuggets, still in their takeout box.\n\nClose the lid, shake well, and you\u2019ve got the drive-thru equivalent of, say, a dozen sauce-tossed wings or tenders at your favorite sports bar. Except that here, the sauce is sweet and sour and mayonnaise mixed together.\n\n\u201cThe resulting creation is one of perfect harmony that touches every corner of the tastebuds,\u201d a Tasting Table reviewer claimed.\n\n3 Shake up your routine by tossing the nuggets in sweet and sour sauce \u2014 and mayonnaise. Eric BVD \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\n\u201cThe sweet, tangy, and sour sauce balances the richness of the mayonnaise. Conversely, the tang of the mayonnaise cuts through the sweetness of the sweet and sour, creating a dippable, dunkable duo that balances well against the salty crunch of the nuggets,\u201d they enthused.\n\nShould that not sound like something you\u2019d want to eat, don\u2019t worry \u2014 there are numerous other saucy combinations you can try, from honey mustard to tangy buffalo, with or without the addition of mayo.\n\nAnd while McDonald\u2019s may get a bad rap from fast food haters, you can be confident that the occasional order of nuggets is actually relatively good for you, some experts have claimed.\n\nYes, even people whose job it is to promote healthy eating extol the nutritional content of the 100% white meat treat \u2014 though it must be noted that the pros are less than enthusiastic about the corn-syrup packed sauce selection.\n\nNaked, however, a 10-piece order contains 23 grams of protein \u2014 a whopping half of the average recommended dietary allowance.\n\nThe edible bundles of joy contain no preservatives, artificial colors or flavors, it has been reported.\n\nIn an extensive recent ranking of fast food chicken nuggets published by Eat This, Not That, Mickey D\u2019s took third place \u2014 with reviewer Amanda Mactas appreciating the uniform golden brown appearance and the crispiness of each nugget.\n\n3 McDonald\u2019s may get a bad rap from the haters, but some experts claim that an order of chicken nuggets can be relatively good for you. Shutterstock\n\n\u201cThese nuggets are crispy on the outside and both juicy and tender on the inside. The exterior gives just the right amount of crispness without being too bready or overwhelming. Plus, I love that these don\u2019t taste overly salted. Do these taste particularly chicken-y? No. But those classic flavors of childhood really make me enjoy them,\u201d Mactas declared.\n\nFive percent of Americans eat chicken nuggets every day, while 30% of us choose them for dinner once a month, according to Statista.",

The one-of-a-kind McDonald's also blends in perfectly with the setting, made to look like a cozy chalet with a vaulted ceiling and wood paneling inside and out. The golden arches are still plenty visible on the building, so you can recognize it even in the middle of a snow storm, as portrayed in a McSki commercial.\n\nIf you can't make it to this snow-covered McDonald's featuring must-have McDonald's international menu items, perhaps you can try one of the brand's other unique locations.

Courtesy of Sara Heise Graybeal\n\nSeveral years ago, my dad was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. The news was a shock. At 84 years old, Daddy had been dedicated to his physical health for decades. He played tennis twice a week, ate my mother\u2019s low-fat meals, and spent lots of time outdoors on their organic vegetable farm.\n\nBut the diagnosis did explain the symptoms he\u2019d been experiencing. He got out of breath more quickly. He had a cough that wouldn\u2019t go away. And he\u2019d lost so much weight, none of his old clothes fit \u2014 likely, the doctors said, because taking in less oxygen limited his exertion, thus lessening his appetite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPulmonary fibrosis is considered a progressive, terminal disease; there is no cure for the irreversible scarring of the lungs that occurs. But my dad told me not to dwell on that \u2014 and not, under any circumstances, to google it. All that mattered, he said, was that it wasn\u2019t cancer.\n\n\u201cMaybe I will reverse it,\u201d he mused, \u201cand demonstrate that it\u2019s reversible after all!\u201d\n\nHe approached his diagnosis with his trademark jovial attitude, and I didn\u2019t doubt the sincerity of his optimism, but I had a hard time feeling it myself. The pandemic had been raging for two years, and I couldn\u2019t help but think my dad was one COVID infection away from life-threatening complications. I also found his new physical limitations hard to watch \u2014 the way he stopped to catch his breath, panting, after walking down the stairs; the rope from his tool shed now threaded through his belt loops to hold up his pants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo slow the progression of the disease, the doctors issued a list of suggested life modifications, and my dad hated all of them. Stop mowing the hay fields? Stop heating the house with the wood stove? These activities had likely contributed to his lung scarring, doctors said, but they were also some of my dad\u2019s greatest joys.\n\nAt first, he rebelled. He bought an air purifier to offset the wood stove\u2019s impacts. He took to riding the tractor with a mask in his pocket, which he could pull out if anyone asked (none of us ever saw him wearing it).\n\nThe author's father making hay on his North Carolina farm in May 2024. Courtesy of Sara Heise Graybeal\n\nEventually, my mom used a study linking wood stove use to lung cancer in women to persuade my dad to give up this one earthly pleasure for her sake. After that, he proved slightly more open to change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen his doctor mentioned that alcohol often worsened a secondary medical condition he was dealing with, Daddy surprised everyone by quitting immediately. The bottle of bourbon I\u2019d already chosen for his birthday sat on my shelf untouched.\n\nMy dad\u2019s lifestyle choices were trending in the right direction, but there was still one big problem: his weight.\n\nDaddy had once been 6 feet tall and 155 pounds. Now at 5 foot 8 and just 123 pounds, he weighed less than anyone else in the family. At lunch, he ate peanut butter smeared on a single slice of bread and claimed to be full. Mom pressed him to take second helpings at dinner, but she had increasing difficulty finding food he liked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the last four decades, my mother had sold organic fruits and vegetables at a local farmer\u2019s market and assembled them into fresh meals for her family. She taught my brother and me to eschew fast food, reject sodas and always opt for low-fat milk and ice cream. When we played away soccer games in high school, our parents came to watch but refused to eat at the Arby\u2019s or KFC or Golden Corral that everyone else headed to after the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too depressing in there,\u201d they told us.\n\nIf Mom was our health food leader, Daddy was her willing right-hand man. But along with the other changes his body had undergone, his taste buds also seemed to weaken around the time of his diagnosis. He no longer enjoyed salads and rice and beans the way he used to. He cared more about color and texture now, Mom noted irritably. He refused leftovers because, once in their Tupperware containers, they no longer seemed visually appealing.\n\nWith her own health issues to worry about \u2014 including high cholesterol and a predisposition for diabetes \u2014 Mom kept cooking the same plant-based meals she always had, and continued trying to convince Daddy to eat larger portions of them. But he remained stubborn, and the risk his low weight presented felt increasingly dire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe author's mother and father in Pittsboro, North Carolina. Courtesy of Sara Heise Graybeal\n\nI was torn over this food dilemma. On one hand, my dad was far too skinny, and everyone agreed this was now the most urgent medical issue to address. On the other hand, was it my mom\u2019s responsibility to fix it?\n\nI started cooking beef stews and chicken casseroles on the weekend and driving them down to my parents\u2019 farm. This way, my mom could keep eating her vegetables, and my dad could load up on fat and protein. However, this fix was unsustainable \u2014 as a working mom of a toddler, my schedule was far from predictable. Any bump in the road meant it could be several weeks before I had time to take my dad more meals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe solution came so quietly and unexpectedly that, at first, we missed it. One day at lunchtime, my dad was driving home from playing tennis with some friends and felt an unusual sensation \u2014 hunger. A McDonald\u2019s just north of our town had opened up several years before, but no one in our family had ever stopped there. Now, as he saw the restaurant\u2019s giant yellow M glinting in the sun ahead of him, Daddy felt a strangely powerful urge to stop. He pulled in, parked his car, and did something he\u2019d never done before: ordered Chicken McNuggets and fries.\n\nDaddy drove home slowly, his meal open in the passenger seat, savoring the extravagant taste of this new food.\n\n\u201cReady for lunch?\u201d Mom asked when he arrived.\n\n\u201cI picked something up on the way,\u201d Daddy told her, and, imagining his typical granola bar or pack of peanut butter crackers, she sighed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo days later, Daddy did it again. Sitting at McDonald\u2019s, sunlight spilling in through the window, he worked through McNuggets, French fries and the New York Times headlines on his phone. Despite his tennis loss that morning, he came home cheerful. Mom couldn\u2019t figure it out.\n\nA few days after that, Daddy decided that the only thing that could make McDonald\u2019s taste even better was to eat it in his favorite chair at the head of the dining room table. So he ordered his meal to go, brought the bag home, and unveiled his McNuggets and fries in front of my mom, who was crunching her salad. She was predictably disgusted. But as the salty grease flooded his mouth, he found he didn\u2019t really care.\n\nDaddy\u2019s juicy story made its way around the family. After 37 years of eating chickpeas, kale and tofu, he had found his way to McDonald\u2019s. Tickled, I took my son to the drive-thru to see what all the fuss was about. We got enough takeout for all of us and unloaded it onto my parents\u2019 dining room table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMom, tight-lipped, tipped leftover quinoa into a bowl. Daddy, delighted, accepted his large carton of fries.\n\nI watched Mom\u2019s face as we chowed down in front of her. I knew how difficult this might be for her. She had labored so diligently to feed us well for so many years, and now we seemed to be throwing her hard work back in her face.\n\nBut I also saw a softening \u2014 a brightening. She didn\u2019t have to make dinner that night, and after so many evenings in the kitchen, that was a blessing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe author's father enjoying his birthday cake in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, in September 2023. Courtesy of Sara Heise Graybeal\n\nThe bigger blessing came at my dad\u2019s next doctor\u2019s appointment, where he learned he\u2019d gained 10 pounds. \u201cYou\u2019re on the right track!\u201d his doctor cheered.\n\n\u201cBut here\u2019s the thing,\u201d said Mom. \u201cDoes it matter how he\u2019s gaining the weight?\u201d\n\nDaddy grimaced at her.\n\n\u201cTo be frank,\u201d the doctor replied, \u201cthe man\u2019s 87. He could be eating chocolate bars all day and I\u2019d be OK with it. Whatever he\u2019s doing, he needs to stay the course.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing Mom respects, it\u2019s a doctor\u2019s orders. So Daddy kept going to McDonald\u2019s. Mom kept making her salads. And while his battle with pulmonary fibrosis continued, I slowly stopped worrying that a common cold would knock Daddy sideways. The day he unstrung the rope from his belt loops \u2014 and his pants didn\u2019t fall \u2014 we all cheered.\n\nMy son and I aren\u2019t McDonald\u2019s converts. Unlike Daddy, we don\u2019t go two or three times a week. But once my son got a taste of the PlayPlace, I knew we\u2019d be back at least occasionally. I have to admit, their Big Breakfast tastes surprisingly good on a Sunday morning, and a mouthful of hot fries after a soccer defeat does lift our spirits somehow.\n\nI\u2019d never say that fast food is the cure for all \u2014 or most \u2014 of life\u2019s problems, or even that it makes a great choice for a meal. Few medical professionals would prescribe a bag of grease and salt as a solution to anything. But watching the joy those McNuggets and fries brought my dad \u2014 not to mention the weight they\u2019ve helped him gain and maintain \u2014 made me rethink what I consider absolutes in my own life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe there are times to ease up and experience something new. Maybe an answer to our prayers can come from the most unexpected place. It might not be a Big Mac that\u2019s going to change my \u2014 or your \u2014 life, but maybe it\u2019s something else we\u2019ve never tried. Maybe joy is waiting down the road, just beyond that offramp we\u2019ve never taken. Maybe we should try it sometime.\n\nGo Ad-Free \u2014 And Protect The Free Press The next four years will change America forever.

            "content": "CHICAGO, Jan. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Perch Energy , a leading community solar provider, announced 31 Wendy's and McDonald's locations owned by Mike Allegro of All Star Management across northern Illinois are estimated to save over $20,000 annually for 20 years on their electricity costs from local community solar farms in Rockford and Pontiac.\n\nThis is the latest instance of fast-food chains participating in environmentally friendly practices. Based on the franchises\u2019 energy use through 2024, the fast-food locations would collectively save an estimated $1 million over two decades. In their first round of community solar subscriptions with Perch Energy, the restaurants will lock in about half a million dollars of savings from solar farms producing almost 8 MW of clean electricity. As additional capacity becomes available, the franchises will have the opportunity to double their initial subscription to achieve their estimated $1 million savings potential. The energy produced from these solar farms is the carbon equivalent of avoiding 13,437 metric tons of CO2 emissions, or like removing 3,134 cars from the road each year.\n\n\u201cIt was an easy decision. A lot of our restaurants are open early and close late. And some are open 24 hours a day, so we use a lot of electricity,\u201d said Mike Allegro, the franchise owner. \u201cEverything is more expensive these days, but while the cost of everything else is going up, it\u2019s one bill that Perch and Solar On Earth are helping to bring back down.\u201d\n\nSmall-scale solar farms like the Perch-managed projects in Pontiac and Rockland are accessible through community solar programs to many businesses, renters, and homeowners that pay an electric bill. Solar on Earth, a community solar customer acquisition organization, facilitated the partnership between Perch and Mr. Allegro. Solar on Earth partners with Perch in six states to help individuals and businesses access the cost-savings of clean energy.\n\n\u201cThis partnership shows how beneficial community solar can be for all customers. Any business, organization, municipality, family or individual\u2014really the whole community\u2014stands to benefit from energy savings with community solar,\u201d said Bruce Stewart, President and CEO of Perch Energy. \u201cIt\u2019s the local McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s, but it\u2019s also the school, the apartment building, the homeowner and all of Main Street that gets to access savings in a real way.\u201d\n\nWith community solar, the restaurant chains will receive the benefits of clean energy development without the need for on-site solar panels, allowing for energy savings while supporting the deployment of local clean energy resources. When the solar farms Perch manages produce clean energy, subscribers like Wendy\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s will be compensated through a discount on their electricity bills\u2014without any interruptions to their service, or changes to their utility company.\n\nBy tapping into community solar, Mr. Allegro joins a growing network of businesses enrolled in community solar with Perch\u2014a powerful way for big and small enterprises alike to have an environmental impact and operational efficiency.\n\nThe solar farms Mr. Allegro is subscribed to are located near Rockland and Pontiac which provides those communities with the added benefit of local power generation, which increases the resiliency and reliability of the local energy grid helping the utility\u2014ComEd\u2014meet its renewable energy requirements. They were approved by Illinois\u2019 clean energy program, Illinois Shines which is administered by the Illinois Power Agency.\n\nThe move by All Star Management is a testament to the growing momentum of sustainability in the food service industry. Perch Energy looks forward to supporting additional restaurant chains and businesses to access clean energy throughout Illinois in the years to come.\n\nAbout Perch Energy:\n\nBoston-based Perch Energy is an industry-leading community solar servicer that's helped renters, homeowners, and businesses save more than $38 million cumulatively in total energy discounts since its founding. To date, Perch has provided services for solar projects which have generated over 2.1 billion kWh of power across Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nFischTank PR\n\nperch@fischtankpr.com\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/4444965b-d6b2-452f-8edd-2bccbb0fbf47",

Well, unless they need a hug.\n\nDuring a 1st quarter timeout in a tense game against Gloucester, an outsider joined the huddle.

We knew tonight could be a special night, so I asked my husband to buy her a plane ticket home. They lied to me, or didn't tell me, that she flew home early this morning to come to the game today.\"\n\nThe surprise was total. and provided a measure of closure.\n\n\"It was a great lie,\" McDonald said. \"Mackenzie played for us.

I'm so glad she was here.\"\n\nWinning 300 games was never on McDonald's to do list when her career started.\n\n\"I got put on the staff as a JV coach, and I've been here ever since,\" McDonald said. \"Now I feel like it's just in my blood. It's what I do.\n\n\"The wins. I never thought about anything like that. It's never been a goal or anything. It just happened. Over the years, I've had such great kids and families and administration. This isn't about me. This is about everybody that's been a part of this for a long time.\"\n\nMcDonald has always been a commanding presence on the sideline.

When you get to know her, she just is such a nice person and a great coach. She helped me develop a lot into a better player.\"\n\nDaunting as first impressions might be, there's a secret to her success.\n\n\"She doesn't criticize us,\" Logan said. \"She just helps us. You always know that she wants the best for us.\"\n\nThat principle is a two-way street. As much as McDonald has lifted the Silver Knights, the program has given back.\n\n\"I've learned so much from our players,\" McDonald said. \" I've learned from their families. I feel like what we do in Sterling basketball is just play with grit and heart and determination. Therse kids have overachieved and passed every test I've put in front of them. They're just strong, tough, good kids with good families. They give me everything.\"\n\nTom Rimback grew up reading the Burlington County Times and Courier Post sports sections and began writing for the BCT in 1996.

Those who order through the McDonald\u2019s app will unlock an in-game bonus for the Pok\u00e9mon TCG Pocket app.\n\nPlayers of the Pok\u00e9mon Go mobile game can also visit sponsored Pok\u00e9Stops or Gyms when visiting McDonald\u2019s restaurants in the U.S. as part of a collaboration that kicked off in December. The efforts are the latest attempts by the burger chain to wed pop culture with nostalgia.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is stepping into the world of Pok\u00e9mon with its latest collaboration, a move that could help the chain grow loyalty among the game\u2019s wide range of fans. Pok\u00e9mon was wildly popular during the late \u201890s and early aughts and gained a renewed sense of excitement in 2016 with the launch of Pok\u00e9mon Go. With its limited-time Happy Meals, McDonald\u2019s is continuing its run of leveraging nostalgia in its marketing, a tactic often deployed by the chain in recent years.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more exciting than when we can bring campaigns to our fans with partners that we\u2019re fans of ourselves,\u201d said Guillaume Huin, senior marketing director at McDonald's, in press details. \u201cMuch like they do for McDonald\u2019s, our fans have deep nostalgia and love for the Pok\u00e9mon brand.\u201d\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Happy Meal, available nationwide starting Jan. 21, includes a Pok\u00e9mon booster pack, poster and sticker sheet. Additionally, each box leverages one of four designs featuring characters Charizard, Pikachu and Dragonite together, Rayquaza and Roaring Moon.\n\nAdditionally, every Happy Meal purchase made through the McDonald\u2019s app will unlock an in-game bonus for the Pok\u00e9mon TCG Pocket app at no additional cost. Consumers will receive a one-time redeemable code to unlock 24 pack hourglasses and 12 wonder hourglasses that can be used to open two digital booster packs and select one randomized digital card. The move could help McDonald\u2019s spur more app downloads and help it collect valuable first-party data.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is also flexing a Pok\u00e9mon Go tie-up that kicked off in the U.S. in December. For the effort, players of the mobile app can visit sponsored Pok\u00e9Stops, or real-world landmarks, and Gyms, locations throughout the Pokemon Go world where players can battle rival teams, when visiting McDonald\u2019s restaurants. Players can visit participating locations during specific weeks from now until the end of March to take part in the activation, including Jan. 20 to Jan. 26, Feb. 10 to Feb. 16 and March 10 to March 16.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s joins other marketers, like Circle K and Foot Locker, that have teamed with Pok\u00e9mon Go in the past. The burger chain often seeks to bring together culture and nostalgia. Last year, the brand launched a campaign inspired by how it is often depicted in anime and manga that included a \u201cWcDonald\u2019s\u201d push in over 30 global markets. The year prior, the chain collaborated with artist and streetwear influencer Kerwin Frost for a Happy Meal box that included a McNugget Buddy collectible, which returned for the first time in over 25 years.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s reported a 0.3% increase in U.S. same-store sales in Q3 2024, a slight increase that sees the chain continuing to struggle with winning over cash-strapped consumers who are opting to eat at home more often. The brand\u2019s campaigns around value and core menu items were among the factors supporting the increase. Earlier this month, the chain rolled out a value platform with a marketing effort featuring actor and pro wrestler John Cena.",

After more than three decades on Broadway, a Tony Award for Moulin Rouge! and six additional Tony nominations, Burstein, like his co-star Audra McDonald, possesses the kind of ease on stage that makes audiences sit back and relax. How heavenly is it to witness these two great stars fall in and out of love, including their sublime rendition of \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Get Away From Me\u201d?\n\nBurstein is the rare actor who toggles effortlessly between featured and leading roles in plays and musicals, and he\u2019s enjoying every moment in George C. Wolfe\u2019s acclaimed revival. In a recent chat with Broadway.com, he reflected on his career (with an overarching use of the word \u201clove\u201d) and the bittersweet feeling of inhabiting the Majestic Theatre dressing room used by his late wife, Rebecca Luker, during her run as Christine in The Phantom of the Opera.\n\nDanny Burstein, Joy Woods and Audra McDonald in \"Gypsy\" (Photo: Julieta Cervantes)\n\nGypsy is one of the biggest events of the Broadway season. Why did you want to be part of it?\n\nWhen I heard the show was happening, I thought, \u201cOh my goodness, wow.\u201d I love Audra, she\u2019s been a friend for almost 30 years, and I just felt that I would love to play the role opposite her. There\u2019s something about Herbie\u2019s struggle that has always intrigued me. I only saw the show once, in community theater when I was 15, and I saw the movie. I felt like the role was sort of a lapdog, and I didn\u2019t want to take that route with it. I wanted him to fight her, be a foil to her, show that he believed in her and was passionate about her and saw their future together.\n\nIt's so interesting that you never saw any of the Broadway productions, featuring notable Herbies.\n\nNo, and most of those guys are dear, dear friends. I worked with [original star] Jack Klugman, I worked with Boyd Gaines [a Tony winner opposite Patti LuPone], John Dossett [co-star with Bernadette Peters] and Jonathan Hadary [with Tyne Daly]. I love them and have them with me every moment\u2014and then you try to make it your own.\n\nWhat does Herbie see in Rose?\n\nTo me, it\u2019s love at first sight. Their first scene is so quick\u2014it\u2019s two-and-a-half pages, and by the end of it they\u2019ve decided to become business partners and a couple. You know, it\u2019s a musical. [laughs] I just feel like he sees that she\u2019s the missing piece in his life, the person who completes him.\n\nAudra McDonald, Andrew Kober, Danny Burstein and Jordan Tyson in \"Gypsy\"\n\n(Photo: Julieta Cervantes)\n\nYou have wonderful chemistry with Audra. What impresses you most about her performance?\n\nOh, Audra is a marvel. I love being on stage with her, not just as a colleague but also as a fan. When she\u2019s doing her stuff, I can only stand back and be amazed at the amount of energy and commitment she puts forth every single night. And she does it eight times a week! I worked very hard when I did Fiddler on the Roof, a three-hour show similar to this, where you\u2019re on stage the whole time, but she\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen. Because we are old friends, it\u2019s easy to fall in love with her every night. We fell into our roles and continue to try to make them deeper and more organic every single performance. That\u2019s our mutual goal, and we do it without saying anything; we just naturally understand each other.\n\nYou\u2019ve been in five or six shows that would make anyone\u2019s list of the best musicals of all time, from Follies and South Pacific to Fiddler on the Roof and My Fair Lady\u2026\n\n\u2026and Cabaret.\n\nYes! What makes Gypsy special?\n\nIt\u2019s one of those timeless shows, and the themes are universal. I can\u2019t tell you how many people have said to me, \u201cI would love to bring my mother to this.\u201d [laughs] It\u2019s about the connection people have with their mothers, their fathers, somebody who drove them and pushed them. I get it! The book is so well written, even though it can be dark\u2014the way Audra plays it, especially, delves into those places. The score is one unbelievable hit after another, fantastic melodies that feel like musical theater mother\u2019s milk, and then those incredible lyrics that Steve Sondheim put on top of them. I worked with Steve three times, and he told me, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get much better than Gypsy.\u201d He\u2019s right.\n\nYour home base in the Majestic is the dressing room used by your late wife, Rebecca Luker.\n\nYes, when I was offered the role, that was one of the first things I talked to my agent about. I said, \u201cI really don\u2019t care where it is exactly, but I would like to be in the dressing room Rebecca stayed in for two-and-a-half years doing Phantom.\u201d I have a picture of her in the room, and I have her name on one of those little sliders [placed on the wall outside each dressing room].\n\nDanny Burstein with wife Rebecca Luker in 2017 (Photo by Emilio Madrid for Broadway.com)\n\nYou share your life in such a natural way on Instagram. What\u2019s been the key to remaining upbeat and optimistic after the losses and challenges you\u2019ve experienced?\n\nTo be 100-percent honest, I just keep going. Part of it is excitement about what the future is, and part of it is fear of falling backwards. Because I think if I fell backwards, I would be very sad, and I\u2019ve never been that type of person; I\u2019ve always been a person who sets his sights on what\u2019s going to happen next. Since Becca\u2019s passing [in December 2020], I go on vacations with my best friend, George Dvorsky, to places Becca and I wanted to go. The whole experience made me realize how finite our time here is, so I want to be as kind as possible, put as much love out as possible, and do good things and fun things and laugh and enjoy my life.\n\nOn a happy note, what was the recent South Pacific reunion concert like?\n\nIt was truly one of the best nights of my life. You can go home again\u2014that\u2019s what it taught me. I was so happy to reunite with the original cast, who I love dearly, and to sing \u201cNothing Like a Dame\u201d again. It just meant the world to me that my dear friend Loretta Ables Sayre, who I never see enough, was there, and Kelli [O\u2019Hara], Paulo [Szot], everybody. I was in the middle of rehearsals for Gypsy, then a week of rehearsals for South Pacific, and then the week of the concert, the critics were coming [to Gypsy], so it was insane, but I just had to do it.\n\nIs it fair to say that the one-two punch of The Drowsy Chaperone and South Pacific made people look at you in a new light? Like, this guy can do it all?\n\nSpecifically, Drowsy Chaperone put me on the map, and I\u2019ll be forever grateful to [director] Casey Nicholaw and [co-writer] Bob Martin and everybody involved. It was just a bunch of old friends who got together and put on a show, one of those incredible companies and experiences. We loved each other so much\u2014Beth Leavel is my sister, you know? Boy, that show should have a reunion concert, although I\u2019m not sure we could do the dancing anymore.\n\nI\u2019ve never forgotten a 2008 interview you did with Broadway.com in which you quoted an elderly Tony Randall saying that an actor\u2019s life never gets any easier. Does that notion still resonate?\n\nWhat he meant was that the longing for the next gig doesn\u2019t get easier. He had asked me if I had a job coming up, and when I said I didn\u2019t, he looked down and said, \u201cIt never gets any easier.\u201d But thankfully, I\u2019ve been one of those very blessed actors: My career has been fairly steady, and I haven\u2019t had too much downtime. And when I have, I guess my life experience has taught me that it\u2019s going to be OK no matter what happens.\n\nFor now, Broadway audiences are lucky to see you and Audra on stage together.\n\nI\u2019m the lucky one. Last night, I said to Audra as we walked off stage, \u201cEvery once in a while, you realize how lucky you are,\u201d and she went, \u201cRight?\u201d We look down at the audience and there are 1,600 people jumping to their feet, screaming and happy. It\u2019s such a privilege, it really is.",

A steaming double shot espresso\u2014like the one Mom used to drink at times when Dad's and my rivalry for love got on her nerves, when residual thoughts from her nightmares about bombings and shootings lingered into the day, or when she couldn\u2019t remember if she\u2019d locked the front door\u2014spilling over the edges of the paper cup.\n\n\u201cSweetie, look at this,\u201d she\u2019d say pointing to blackened lumps of flesh as if we were in a museum.\n\nIt\u2019s three in the morning, and I\u2019m stuck at Vnukovo, waiting for my flight back to New York.\n\nIn the U.S., they have purple M&M\u2019s, and light blue, and pink, and beige. All sorts of flavors: pumpkin spice, Easter Sundae, almond, orange vanilla cream, \u201cCookies&Scream,\u201d crispy double dark chocolate strawberried peanut butter XXL. At Moscow\u2019s only airport, I buy a pack of yellow M&M\u2019s.\n\nLast week, I told myself I\u2019d quit sugar. I made the same promise to Mom when I was eight. She showed me a documentary about life with diabetes and took me to the morgue to see fat, swollen diabetic corpses with rotten arms, legs, and penises. \u201cSweetie, look at this,\u201d she\u2019d say pointing to blackened lumps of flesh as if we were in a museum.\n\nBitter vending machine espresso and yellow peanut M&M\u2019s. I hate everything bitter, and I hate everything peanut, and I hate bitter coffee and yellow M&M\u2019s. I throw it all out.\n\nI promised to quit coffee too, but I don\u2019t remember when and to whom. Probably to one of the ladies I started and ended seeing as quickly as I threw out my airport snacks. Since Tonia and I parted (there is something cruel in the phrase \u201cbreak up\u201d that makes me avoid it at all costs), I\u2019ve spent a lot of whatever money on whatever people. Now my bogus world tour, plotted along the function of maximizing the distance between me and Tonia, is ending, and my world is retreating back into its contours: M&M\u2019s, McDonalds, shootings. Excess. Lack.\n\nShe puts emojis on her LinkedIn profile.\n\nTonia was great, and I really loved her. And she really loved me. There\u2019s not much to say now though. Perhaps, only the words my father told me over a phone call, as he heard the news: c\u2019est la vie. C\u2019est la vie, buddy. That\u2019s life.\n\nSo I\u2019m going back to New York. No coffee, no M&M\u2019s, no Tonia.\n\nThe old couple next to me is muttering about a bomb on a plane. On a sweet, old Airbus A319 with its 30-inch seat pitch and snacks for an extra fee\u2014that\u2019s how they put it. I listen to them while boarding. I listen to them while stowing my bag. I listen to them as I buckle up, plug cheap headphones into my armrest, and scroll through Delta\u2019s movie library. It is only after I gobble down a $14.99 700-calorie pack of chocolate M&M\u2019s and learn the snoring melodies of different passengers that I land and check my email:\n\nWe are offering our sincerest apologies. There was, in fact, a bomb threat. But there is no need for concern whatsoever. The bomber used an AI chatbot to design a yada yada bomb. He assembled it in the airport, and was caught due to suspicious internet traffic ('terrorist attack American plane punishment\u2019 Google search). The criminal didn\u2019t use a VPN. He is now in custody. We are offering our sincerest yada yada yada. Please rate your experience with Delta.\n\nHell, I\u2019m not doing shit with Angelina Jolie!\n\nThey want 1,000 words of feedback if I don\u2019t give them five stars. I close the email and sign up for a VPN. My IP address is masked as I go on WebMD to look up disturbing changes in my body that I deem too intimate, too revealing, and too serious to discuss with my primary care doctor. My digital footprint is hidden as I look through Tonia\u2019s tagged pictures on Instagram. The more I try to bring her closer, the brighter the distance between us shines. Tonia\u2019s Amazon wishlist is just a bunch of board games. She puts emojis on her LinkedIn profile. As she gets older, she\u2019s starting to look more and more like her mother. I wonder if sunscreen could\u2019ve protected her skin from the sun and saved us from the passing of time. 120 SPF wouldn\u2019t have hurt. And even though pixelated Tonia never smiles at my jokes, she is enough to bring back the memories of the real Tonia: the shape of her nose, the oniony smell of her armpits, scattered across the floppy disk of my mind. Too many copies of the same file. After all, her nose is just the same as her smell in that it is Tonia\u2019s.\n\nI close the Mail app. My year-long flight back to New York has finally ended. Now I move and languish in white milky froth, in the meringue of memories, in the cotton candy of silence. I go days without saying a word, like a monk Paramount Pictures would show you in their new blockbuster. I do not, however, kiss Angelina Jolie, or save Angelina Jolie, or fight Angelina Jolie. Hell, I\u2019m not doing shit with Angelina Jolie!\n\nWhen Dad calls, I am still a monk. He listens to me breathe for a while.\n\n\u201cHey? You there?\u201d\n\nThe only thing I can do is be here.\n\n\u201cDid you eat today?\u201d\n\nHe pauses after every word, thinks I\u2019m deranged. Dad had to become both Mom and Dad when we left Moscow. \u201cDid you eat today?\u201d is an expression of controlled tenderness and anxiety; it\u2019s more than Dad\u2019s nonchalance and less than Mom\u2019s neurosis. My immigrant Dad, a jumble of \u201cmores\u201d and \u201clesses\u201d.\n\nWe used to play catch in the backyard before lunch on weekends. Throw-whoosh-catch-shmuk, throw-whoosh-catch-shmuk, throw\u2026 Ouch! Sorry! Does it hurt? A little. Don\u2019t cry. Let\u2019s go inside, we\u2019ve got some frozen meatballs in the fridge. I\u2019d hold the bag of frozen IKEA meatballs to the bump on my head. Will it leave a scar? Then he\u2019d need the meatballs for soup. A scar? No. We\u2019d eat soup. Dad would instruct me how to eat properly (at least 15 chews per bite). Then I\u2019d chew my soup.\n\n\u201cYes, Dad.\u201d\n\nThis is the first thing I said all week.\n\n\u201cI had soup.\u201d\n\nThis is the second thing. Every word comes out thoroughly chewed. I can hear his smile through the phone.",

I was interested in their memories of the brand\u2019s Japanese debut in 1971. Between sips of coffee, a man in his 70s told us that he remembered it vividly: It was around the time that Yukio Mishima, then the nation\u2019s most celebrated writer and a champion of Japanese imperialism, committed suicide after a failed coup. One era was ending, another was beginning, and the transition was marked by the arrival of an American restaurant radically different from anything they had ever seen.\n\nLike so many of my fellow Westerners, I\u2019ve felt the urge to eat the way locals do while traveling abroad. In a city like Tokyo, there\u2019s an array of sushi bars and noodle shops to choose from, tucked away down the narrowest side streets and waiting for the adventurous traveler. They\u2019re all the rage on Instagram, where those eager to prove they\u2019ve indulged in an authentic eating experience post images of their latest \u201cdiscoveries.\u201d Yet as fond as I am of the hidden gem, I have another, less conventional way to gather insights into local life: I go to fast-food restaurants.\n\nSitting on the hard seat of a Burger King, chicken sandwich in hand, I feel welcome but not intrusive, surrounded by locals as they go about their lives no differently than they would have if I hadn\u2019t shown up at all. If I\u2019m feeling really ambitious, I might ask the group at a table next to mine what I should order here the next time and see where the conversation leads. I\u2019m looking for a very specific encounter with normality. I want to see people living as I do, under global capitalism.\n\nI tend to think the search for authenticity in a new country is rooted in a desire for something we find missing at home. To live almost anywhere in the United States is to be surrounded by brand names. The supposedly authentic foreign experience is perhaps a sense of life untainted by the influence of global brands. Traveling abroad, we may find it only natural to dismiss anything else as less than the \u201creal\u201d version of whichever country we\u2019re visiting. Yet brands like KFC or McDonald\u2019s are just as ingrained in the fabric of everyday life in Dublin, Paris or Tokyo as a given pub, bistro or noodle shop.",

Peterson noticed a deficit in local breakfast options and hoped to fill the gap. After employing a local blacksmith to design a metal ring that would encase a cooking egg and result in an egg patty that would fit in a sandwich, Peterson took his new idea to McDonald\u2019s founder Ray Kroc who approved the iconic fast-food restaurant\u2019s very first breakfast item.\n\n\u201cWe are honored that Herb Peterson has chosen SBNC as the recipient of the sales of the classic Egg McMuffin and encourage everyone to choose one of our local McDonalds as their breakfast stop on Tuesday,\u201d said Dr. Mahdi Ashrafian CEO of Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinics.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s participating in Herb Peterson Day can be found in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, Paso Robles, and Carpinteria. There is a limit of two sandwiches per customer, with the promotion only available during breakfast hours.\n\nSanta Barbara Neighborhood Clinics (SBNC) has a VISION and that is Healthy People: Healthy Communities. We strive in our MISSION to provide high-quality, comprehensive, affordable healthcare to all people, regardless of their ability to pay, in an environment that fosters respect, compassion and dignity.

Credit: Abhiram Juvvadi\n\nSeveral University Life departments have moved to 3935 Walnut St. in the space above the McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThe move \u2014 which includes Career Services, Penn Global, Penn Violence Prevention, Student Intervention Services, and Community Care departments \u2014 marks a step towards the University\u2019s goal to streamline student support services by housing multiple departments under one roof. The University\u2019s Board of Trustees approved a 10-year lease for the spaces in November 2023.\n\nThe lease, which will begin on Jan. 1, 2025, costs $16.29 million for 30,533 square feet of office space.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the community spaces for the student-facing departments in the building which will allow us to host more workshops and training on-site,\u201d Penn Violence Prevention Director Elise Scioscia wrote in a statement to the Daily Pennsylvanian. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to work alongside students to create a culture of consent on our campus.\u201d\n\nThe previous office on 3609-11 Locust Walk will continue to be occupied by the Division of University Life\u2019s leadership and Strategic Planning and Operations team.\n\nAmy Gadsden, Penn's Associate Vice Provost for Global Initiatives, previously told the DP that Penn Global was thrilled to move to the new space at 40th and Walnut streets, which she said was the \u201cbustling west end of Penn\u2019s campus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to checking out the new Career Services office, especially since it\u2019s so much closer to my dorm,\u201d said College sophomore Kaylee Wong. \u201cIt\u2019s super cold lately, so I\u2019m glad the walk is shorter.\u201d\n\nThe property at 3935 Walnut St. was purchased by Penn in December 2021.\n\nAt the time of purchase, Penn Executive Director of Real Estate Ed Datz explained that the location at the intersection of 40th and Walnut streets would be an ideal site for redevelopment due to its close proximity to student housing.\n\nThe new McDonald\u2019s opened in October 2024, several months earlier than initially anticipated. Students and community members flocked to the store\u2019s grand reopening and have widely frequented the store in the months since.\n\nThe Daily Pennsylvanian is an independent, student-run newspaper.

The program rewards participants for making sparkling non-alcoholic beverages at home using a SodaStream. The campaign kicked off on January 7 and runs through January 31, giving people a chance to earn up to $5 in tips for each mocktail created. Instead of paying tips to bartenders, SodaStream will tip consumers for crafting their non-alcoholic sparkling drinks.\n\nTo participate in the Tips for Sips program, consumers should create a mocktail at home using a SodaStream machine, share their drinks on Instagram Stories with the hashtag #TipsForSipsGiveaway, and tag @SodaStream. After posting, participants will receive a link to an online entry form via direct message from SodaStream. Each participant is eligible to enter once per day, and the reward will be sent via Venmo. The campaign will be promoted across Instagram and TikTok, where SodaStream will also provide additional mocktail inspiration to help keep Dry January exciting.\n\nThe Tips for Sips campaign highlights SodaStream\u2019s commitment to promoting healthier, more sustainable beverage choices. By providing a fun, rewarding way to enjoy Dry January, SodaStream is helping people embrace alcohol-free options while reducing reliance on single-use plastic bottles. As part of the Tips for Sips campaign, SodaStream plans to share mocktail recipes, offer practical tips, and sponsor tutorials for making exceptional sparkling drinks.\n\nWatch this Instagram reel as SodaStream promotes the event: https://www.instagram.com/sodastream/reel/DEks7ZFpBaG/\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Focuses on Smaller Formats for CosMc\u2019s Growth\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has released an update on its website stating that it plans to open two new small-format CosMc\u2019s locations in Texas this year while closing three of its regular locations converted from traditional McDonald\u2019s restaurants. The shift to smaller formats comes after the company found that these locations are more effective for the concept, offering an optimized experience focused on the drive-thru and digital features. Since launching CosMc\u2019s, McDonald's has experimented with different store sizes and layouts, learning that smaller locations better meet customer needs.\n\nThe company said in a statement, \u201cSince opening CosMc\u2019s, we have had the benefit of testing out different location sizes and setups \u2013 from revamping larger restaurant spaces to building smaller prototype locations that focus more on the drive-thru and digital experience. We learned that the smaller format stores allow us to test new, unique circumstances that are reflective of our customer base.\u201d\n\nCosMc\u2019s expansion has provided valuable insights into the beverage space, with customer feedback helping to shape the menu. Popular offerings include the Island Pick Me Up Punch, Sour Energy Burst, and Churro Cold Brew Frappe, with Fruity Popping Boba being the top drink customization. On the food side, Savory Hashbrown Bites and McPops (mini doughnuts) have proven to be customer favorites.\n\nLearn more about McDonald\u2019s CosMc\u2019s journey here: https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-stories/article/cosmcs-journey.html\n\nAir India Expands Loyalty Program and Announces Growth Strategy\n\nAir India is set to expand its refreshed loyalty program, Maharaja Club, to Air India Express customers, offering more rewards and benefits. Currently, Air India Express\u2019 frequent flyer program is part of the Tata NeuPass platform, integrating loyalty across Tata brands. The overhaul of Air India\u2019s loyalty program last year introduced a points-based system with enhanced earning and redemption opportunities, increasing membership from three million to 10 million. Air India also plans to add co-branded credit cards to its suite of offerings.\n\nAir India Chief Commercial Officer and Transformation Officer, Nippun Aggarwal, said, \u201cThe co-branded credit cards present a huge market opportunity. The numbers that we have today are very small, and we are working to simplify the card portfolio and come out with a new card with a much stronger value proposition.\u201d\n\nAir India and Air India Express are also optimizing their operations to cater to different market segments. Air India will focus on premium traffic and international and metro markets, while Air India Express will handle short-haul markets and domestic routes. According to Aggarwal, the segmentation is part of a plan to enhance connectivity through hubs and create stronger corridors to Europe, North America, and beyond. Additionally, network rationalization has already reduced overlaps between the two airlines, contributing to greater efficiency in their network.\n\nLearn more about Air India\u2019s Maharaja Club here: https://www.airindia.com/in/en/maharaja-club/about.html\n\nRead More on Trends, Updates, and Industry Leaders\n\nOriginal Article Links:\n\nSODASTREAM FLIPS THE SCRIPT ON TIPPING THIS DRY JANUARY\n\nMcDonald\u2019s will focus on smaller formats to grow its CosMc\u2019s concept\n\nAir India Loyalty Program to Include Air India Express: Plus, Plans for First Class and New Long-Haul Hubs Peden Doma Bhutia photo Peden Doma Bhutia",

According to the article, Zakarian didn't even polish off his half sandwich. The big winner was the fries, which he confirmed would be reason to return (along with, perhaps surprisingly, the coffee).It seems like even if he'd known about McDonald's secret menu items and how to order them, Zakarian wouldn't likely become a Mickey D's convert (in fact, he might be better off adding to a list of menu items to avoid ordering at the restaurant).\n\nBeyond hot takes on the fast food, in the original article as well as a follow-up video interview with CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street,\" Zakarian had thoughts on how the chain could improve not only their menu items, but elements like ambience (\"You need a wow,\" he said of the space), and most importantly, messaging. \"You want a narrative, you want a story,\" he said. He emphasized that some of the menu items didn't fit that McDonald's narrative, like the chicken wrap.\n\nStill, Zakarian did give some flowers to the McDonald's corporation. \"It's a dynamic, American, job-creating machine,\" he said in praise. He also offered at least one bit of advice could be applied to just about everything in life, no matter who you are: \"You don't have to be everything to everybody. You just have to focus and be the best you can be.\"",

            "content": "When Dick and Mac McDonald opened the first McDonald\u2019s the idea was to bring fast, cheap food to busy people in the suburbs of Chicago.\n\nThe first hamburger back in 1948 cost just 15 cents.\n\nThat\u2019s my son\u2019s favorite burger (ketchup only, no onions or pickles) so I know it now costs $1.89 at my local McDonald\u2019s.1 That means we\u2019re looking at close to a 12x price increase in the past 77 years or so.\n\nThat sounds like a lot. It\u2019s a big reason for this sentiment:\n\nYou know when I was a kid\u2026\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not that egregious when you look at the inflation figures. That 12x price increase from 15 cents to nearly $2 equates to an annual inflation rate of 3.3%. The actual inflation rate over that period of time was 3.4% per year.\n\nOver long periods of time, even small percentage gains can snowball. It\u2019s one of the reasons your best friend when investing is a long time horizon. People have a hard time wrapping their heads around compounding over the long-run when it comes to prices, investments and incomes.\n\nFor instance, the median income for individuals in 1948 when a McDonald\u2019s hamburger cost 15 cents was just $1,000 a year. Prices mean nothing without a denominator for some perspective.\n\nIncomes change over time because of inflation, growth and progress.\n\nLook at the changes to individual income thresholds over time2 for the median, top 10% and top 5%:\n\nIt\u2019s a steady march up and to the right. It\u2019s also hard to believe how low the absolute income levels were back in the day.\n\nComparing current prices to past price levels can hurt your brain because you anchor to those previous numbers. This is especially true with housing costs this decade.\n\nLance Lambert recently interviewed a mortgage broker about how monthly payments have evolved in the Washington DC area for homebuyers at different levels given the immense rise in housing prices and mortgage rates:\n\nMy average first-time homebuyer now says $3,500 is comfortable, compared to the $2,000 to $2,500 range previously. Those looking for a family house now say $6,500 to $7,500; previously, $4,500 was the primary target. I\u2019m also seeing more people more comfortable with $8,000 to $10,000 mortgage payments than ever. Honestly, for the first 20 years of my career, I don\u2019t believe I ever had a mortgage payment offered over $10,000, and now I have a few of those each quarter.\n\nThese numbers sound insane when you compare them to monthly mortgage payments just a few short years ago when prices and rates were much lower. How can anyone afford these payments?!\n\nThey explain:\n\nKeep in mind, in my region, incomes have exploded higher. I can\u2019t seem to meet anyone who makes less than $130k per year. Those who used to be considered high-income ($250k to $300k) now make $450k. It\u2019s just a different world now.\n\nThis is anecdotal. Washington DC is a relatively wealthy city. But the reason the economy continues to chug along despite much higher prices is become incomes are now much higher too.\n\nIn 2014, $100k put you in the top 10%. Now it takes $150k. The top 5% went from $132k to $201k. People are making way more money now.\n\nPrices were far lower back in the 1960s because wages were lower.\n\nNow, you could say all of the increases over time are because of inflation. And that would get you most of the way there. But there has been progress as well. These are the inflation-adjusted incomes for the top 10% in those same years:\n\n1964 \u2013 $80,516\n\n1974 \u2013 $104,856\n\n1984 \u2013 $98,102\n\n1994 \u2013 $105,901\n\n2004 \u2013 $124,756\n\n2014 \u2013 $130,736\n\nWhat this tells us is wages for the top 10% have outpaced inflation over time. This is a good thing!\n\nIt\u2019s true for median wages as well:\n\n1964 \u2013 $31,809\n\n1974 \u2013 $39,183\n\n1984 \u2013 $36,702\n\n1994 \u2013 $39,431\n\n2004 \u2013 $46,388\n\n2014 \u2013 $44,450\n\nTo be fair, inflation-adjusted wages have increased far more for the top 10% than the median wage earner. But it\u2019s also true that few workers remain in the same income strata for their entire careers. People make more money over time. Some make less. Some see their incomes jump around from high to low and back again.\n\nWhat you thought was a good income in the past might not get you as far in the future.\n\nGood or bad, the goalposts are always moving.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nHow Much Money is Enough?\n\n1And being a personal finance person I obviously use the app to get another 20% off the bill every visit.\n\n2DQYDJ is a really great website for these types of statistics.

            "content": "For many, McDonald's breakfasts are the unofficial sponsor of hectic mornings. The fact that you can get an Egg McMuffin, packed with insanely fluffy eggs and your choice of protein, with a side of a perfectly crispy rectangle of shredded potatoes within minutes is a modern miracle. But those who don't frequent the fast food chain often might find themselves in the dreaded breakfast menu drought zone. Unfortunately, McDonald's is one of the many fast food chains that does not serve breakfast all day, so it's important to keep an eye on local McDonald's breakfast schedules.\n\nWe say \"local McDonald's breakfast schedules\" because it can vary from place to place. According to the McDonald's website, \"Co-Ops and franchisees decide [breakfast windows] at their discretion, but you can often get your favorite breakfast item from the time your local restaurant opens until 10:30 or 11:00 a.m. local time.\" I called my nearest McDonald's to see what its breakfast window was and found that it aligned with what the website said with a small caveat, during the weekdays they serve breakfast until 10:30 a.m. and during the weekends they serve breakfast until 11 a.m.",

            "content": "McDonald's has been utterly dependable since drive-throughs began popping up around the country in the 1950s. Wherever you pulled up, you could order a Big Mac, Happy Meal, and golden, salty fries. But like most chain restaurants, McDonald's has experimented over the years with menu items that veer away from the old standards.\n\nA fan base develops for these trial menu items, and then they disappear. We're still crying into our milkshakes when we think about these fan-favorites they used to sell at McDonald's. Here are the top discontinued menu items that we wish they'd bring back.\n\n\n\nFruit 'N Yogurt Parfait\n\nThis was the perfect breakfast on-the-go when we needed something other than an Egg McMuffin. Sweet, creamy, and topped with crunchy granola, the Fruit 'N Yogurt Parfait also felt like a treat. This went by the wayside in 2022 along with salads and grilled chicken, and we really want it back.\n\nCinnamon Melts\n\nHotcakes are good and all, but nothing beats a squishy mini cinnamon roll dripping with cream-cheese icing. Though there's been a Change.org petition to bring them back since 2017, McDonald's hasn't answered the call. A bigger Cinnamon Roll was on the menu briefly and discontinued in 2023. Our cinnamon-bun cravings aren't being fulfilled in any form.\n\nAll Salads\n\nWe admit McDonald's isn't the first place most run to for health food, but it's nice to have the option of a side salad instead of fries. The Southwest Salad, with cilantro-lime glaze, beans, corn, and tortilla strips, was a favorite. McDonald's completely dropped salads from the American menu in recent years and has no plans of bringing them back. If you want a salad, you'll have to fly overseas.\n\nBig 'N Tasty\n\nThe Big 'N Tasty was McDonald's answer to the Whopper. The sandwich included a quarter-pound beef patty, ketchup, mayonnaise, onions, lettuce, dill pickle slices, and tomato on a sesame seed bun. Sadly, it left the menu more than a decade ago. (Interestingly, McDonald's sells a different burger called the Big Tasty in other parts of the world.)\n\nFried Apple Pie\n\nRemember the crisp, blistered crust and volcanically hot filling of the Fried Apple Pie? Yes, there's a baked version now, but it's nowhere near the same. We'd love to transport ourselves back in time so we can bite into a fried pie.\n\nChicken Selects / Tenders\n\nMade of white breast meat with a peppery, crispy coating, Chicken Selects beat McNuggets any day of the week. More recently we experienced Crispy Buttermilk Tenders, but those are gone, too. McDonald's did test McCrispy Chicken Strips briefly at restaurants in one North Carolina city last year, so we haven't lost all hope yet.\n\nSnack Wraps\n\nWe're happy to report this one has a happy ending. The Chicken Snap Wrap was simple: a tortilla, breaded chicken, lettuce, cheese, and ranch or honey mustard dressing. We loved this burger alternative, and people were furious when it disappeared in 2016. In December, CEO Joe Erlinger announced its return, though we're waiting on a date. If only he'd bring back the other items.",

But as cool as the exclusive Eva figures look, the traumatically philosophical anime series is a bit heavier subject material than we\u2019re used to when it comes to the hamburger chain\u2019s creative partnerships.\n\nSo it\u2019s nice to see that McDonald\u2019s Japan hasn\u2019t forsaken lighthearted fun, which is what\u2019s on the menu with its new line of Sanrio Little Twinkle Stars Kiki and Lala Happy Meal toys.\n\nSanrio\u2019s celestial siblings are celebrating the 50th anniversary of their debut this year, and McDonald\u2019s Japan is joining the festivities with six different Little Twin Stars Happy Meal (or \u201cHappy Set,\u201d as the meals are called in Japan) items. As is becoming the norm for the chain, the complete collection is being split up into a two-stage release, with the first batch available at McDonald\u2019s Japan branches from January 17 to 23, with one of the initial items being the Star Stamp.\n\nAt first glance, this looks like a decorative figurine, and you can definitely use it as one if you wish. All of the Little Twin Stars Happy Meal items are functional too, though, and the bottom of this one includes a paired star stamp.\n\n\u25bc The stamp itself is actually pretty small, but that makes it easy to add to notes or other compact canvases.\n\nAlso in the first batch of items is the Unicorn Comb.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering where the comb is, it\u2019s hidden in the unicorn\u2019s billowy tail, which unfolds like this.\n\nRounding out round one of the Happy Meals is the Star Name Clip.\n\nThis one might be a little tricky to get practical use out of. Sure, the design is easy to use, with a frame that pops open so that you can write your name on a card inside and a clip on the back to attach the case to your clothes or bag. However, it\u2019s a little on the big/heavy side for kids to use, and it\u2019s probably too fancy for most adults to use at their workplace (it\u2019d be fine at SoraNews24 HQ, but we\u2019re not exactly a normal office\u2026).\n\nPerhaps knowing this, the designers made the included name card double-sided, with one side being just a cute illustration of Kiki and Lala riding a unicorn, so that you can just set the case on your desk or shelf as an art display. For that matter, you could take the included card out entirely and replace it with a photograph, turning the name card case into a fashionable photo frame.\n\nThe second batch of Little Twin Stars items won\u2019t be available until January 24, but we were lucky enough to receive an advance delivery of the rest of the lineup, starting with the Star Compact Mirror.\n\nThe designers went the extra mile here, with contoured likenesses of Kiki and Lala on the front side of the closed mirror\u2019s casing, and a stylish ribbon motif for the hinge the mirror opens with.\n\nNext up we have another item which would be cool enough as a purely decorative figurine.\n\nIn truth, though, the Good Friends Accessory Case (or Good Friends Komonoire) pops open to create a space in which to store small items like accessories or cosmetics.\n\nAnd finally, we have the Fluffy Scrunchie, a hair accessory covered in cute illustrations on shimmery fabric that catches the light and fits perfectly with Kiki and Lala\u2019s sparkly aesthetics.\n\nNote that the scrunchie is technically kids-sized, so it may or may not be able to accommodate all adults with particularly voluminous hairstyles. If you can get it on, though, the fabric pattern makes for an eye-catching gradation-like effect when it\u2019s twisted around.\n\nRound 2 of the Little Twin Stars Happy Meals will be available from January 24 to 30, and will be followed by a Round 3, starting on January 31 and running for a limited but undisclosed time, in which all six items will be available. And if seeing Kiki and Lala has you nostalgic for other Sanrio icons who have been around for a while, don\u2019t forget that My Melody\u2019s 50th anniversary celebration is going on this year too with an exhibition in Tokyo, new stop-motion series on Netflix, and special pancakes soon to be in our stomachs.\n\nPhotos \u00a9SoraNews24\n\n\u25cf Want to hear about SoraNews24\u2019s latest articles as soon as they\u2019re published?

            "content": "By Christopher Caggiano\n\nIn a production filled with emotional intensity, Audra McDonald delivers a powerhouse portrayal that elevates a somewhat uneven staging.\n\nWhen it was announced that six-time Tony winner Audra McDonald would take on the role of Mama Rose in a Broadway revival of Gypsy, my initial reaction was a mix of excitement and skepticism: \u201cYay, Audra!\u201d quickly followed by \u201cBut \u2026 isn\u2019t she a soprano?\u201d\n\nHowever, Audra has proven time and again that she is a theatrical force capable of extraordinary feats. I just kept telling myself, \u201cAudra can do anything. Audra can do anything\u2026\u201d But would she be able to truly master one of the most demanding roles in musical theater? The answer is yes \u2014 with a few caveats.\n\nAll doubts about whether Audra was right for the character faded from the moment she made that iconic march up the aisle and stormed on stage. Audra\u2019s Rose is a true powerhouse, filled with relentless energy and sharp comic timing. Sure, occasionally, her portrayal hints at her recent turn as Billie Holiday in Lady Day at Emerson\u2019s Bar & Grill. But rather than being distractions, these moments add complexity to Rose\u2019s character, imbuing the role with both grit and vulnerability.\n\nSo, yeah. Audra can act the role of Rose. But can she sing it? Well, vocally, the role sits at a challenging place in McDonald\u2019s range, frequently hovering at her break. While her mix of head and chest voice in \u201cSome People\u201d is masterful, her final \u201cFor me!\u201d in \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d lacks the climactic belt many might expect. (Well, that I expected.) We\u2019re talking two of the most iconic notes in all of musical theater, and it was a genuine disappointment to hear them sung in head voice, no matter how strong and controlled.\n\nBut, again, Audra\u2019s otherwise dynamic portrayal of Rose more than compensates, particularly in the Act I finale. As Rose hugs Louise to her during \u201cEverything\u2019s Coming Up Roses,\u201d the hug quickly transforms into a full-on half Nelson, with Louise practically choking for air. The \u201cSmall World\u201d reprise in Act II is another standout. Most Roses play this moment as resigned or wistful, but Audra\u2019s raw sobs make Rose\u2019s heartbreak painfully real.\n\nGypsy is often regarded \u2014 and rightly so \u2014 as one of the greatest musicals of all time, if not the greatest. Yet the show has always relied on star power to succeed. From Ethel Merman to Patti LuPone, each revival has been defined by its leading lady, to the point where it\u2019s almost impossible to recast the role once the star decides to leave. It makes me wonder whether Gypsy could ever have a successful run without a star in the central role of Rose. (Well, maybe it might if we didn\u2019t keep reviving it every five years\u2026)\n\nThe show\u2019s iconic overture \u2014 arguably the best in all of musical theater \u2014 is a thrilling reminder of why this show endures. It\u2019s a shame that modern audiences seem to have forgotten that overtures are actually part of the show and that they should really shut the hell up and listen. (Folks are performing here, people!)\n\nGeorge C. Wolfe\u2019s direction here is a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, he brought out exceptional nuance in the relationships among the main characters, particularly Rose and Herbie. Their dynamic was more layered than ever, with palpable moments of both easy humor and genuine physical attraction.\n\nIn particular, Wolfe\u2019s staging of the aborted wedding scene, which transitions into Louise\u2019s first strip as Gypsy Rose Lee, is visually striking and emotionally devastating. As Rose eagerly volunteers her daughter to step in for the missing star stripper and frantically begins to prepare for Louise\u2019s burlesque debut, Louise sits numb staring into the middle distance while Herbie slowly trudges off upstage, defeated. It\u2019s an arresting stage picture.\n\nOn the other hand, Wolfe seems to have given a bit too much leeway to some members of the supporting cast. Jordan Tyson as June is shrill, overplayed. Yeah, sure, June is a great big ham. But Tyson never tempers her exaggerated mugging, even when June is supposedly out of character. It was genuinely off-putting.\n\nThe rest of the cast is considerably more successful. Danny Burstein delivers a deeply sympathetic and layered performance as Herbie, building to an explosive climax in the wedding scene that left me reeling. Also, we can always count on Lesli Margherita for a fully-fledged characterization, and her loopy, jaded Tessie Tura is a major highlight.\n\nJoy Woods as Louise excels in the role\u2019s mousier moments but falters during the strip montage. This may be partly Wolfe\u2019s doing, but Woods doesn\u2019t really do justice to the wry humor and sharp physical punctuation that the scene requires.\n\nAs for Camille A. Brown\u2019s choreography, I must confess a bias. As a devoted admirer of Jerome Robbins and his original choreography, I found this production\u2019s dance a bit too jarring and anachronistic. Brown\u2019s take on \u201cAll I Need Is the Girl\u201d is especially disappointing. Robbins\u2019s genius lay in his ability to use dance as an extension of character, and here, that essential storytelling is mostly absent. Tulsa\u2019s dance feels too polished and lacks the scrappy charm \u2014 and stolen moves \u2014 that underscore his character\u2019s amateur status.\n\nWorse, the staging muffles Louise\u2019s unspoken yearning for Tulsa, losing much of the scene\u2019s emotional impact. In the Robbins staging, as Tulsa demonstrates his nightclub act to Louise, Tulsa does a lift with an imaginary partner while Louise is upstage mimicking his movements as though she were that partner. It\u2019s heartbreaking. In this production, that nuance is reduced to a vague suggestion. So, for me, the scene fell flat, a missed opportunity to deepen Louise\u2019s character arc.\n\nThere has been considerable discussion about the choice to bring together a predominantly African-American cast, director, and choreographer for this Gypsy revival. The intent was apparently to reframe the narrative through the lens of Black experiences in vaudeville, which is certainly admirable. However, this concept felt underexplored in the actual staging, with little to clearly connect the production to this perspective. Production concepts and dramaturgy are all well and good, but they really need to make themselves clear in the show itself, as opposed to directors\u2019 notes or feature stories on theatrical websites.\n\nThis revival of Gypsy succeeds on the strength of Audra McDonald\u2019s powerful performance and George C. Wolfe\u2019s thoughtful exploration of its central relationships. While uneven supporting performances and missed opportunities hold the production back from perfection, the emotional intensity and sheer star power on display make this a Gypsy worth treasuring.\n\nChristopher Caggiano is a freelance writer and editor living in Stamford, CT.

McDonald successfully qualified for the U18 World Championship team by taking second overall in the vertical race.\n\nJay McDonald/Courtesy photo\n\nSummit High School sophomore Jay McDonald was not satisfied with how his cross-country season ended.\n\nAlthough the talented distance runner finished fourth overall at the Class 4A Region 1 meet, McDonald felt like his performance at state was not truly reflective of his training during the summer and fall.\n\nFollowing a 17th-place finish at the state meet as a freshman, McDonald finished 27th overall this fall and ran over 30 seconds slower.\n\nWhile the performance disappointed McDonald, who battled to recover from an injury he sustained at the end of spring track season, he quickly got over that feeling and began training for the winter ski mountaineering season.\n\nSince there has been enough snow on the ground, McDonald has been training with the Team Summit ski mountaineering team alongside his twin brother, John.\n\nMeeting in the early morning hours of winter, the McDonalds have logged a significant amount of skimo training while also spending most afternoons cycling or running. The consistent training resulted in the McDonald brothers posting impressive results as the season gets underway.\n\nJay specifically opened the season with two seventh-place finishes at a U.S. National Cup race \u2014 El Lobo Loco \u2014 at Wolf Creek Ski Area near Pagosa Springs. Jay took seventh in the vertical race on Dec. 7 while John took 11th. A day later, both athletes competed in the individual race, where Jay took seventh again and John jumped up one place from the day prior to take 10th.\n\n\u201cThe running gives you all the fitness, and it helps with the pacing a lot,\u201d Jay said. \u201cWhen you are going uphill, I think running helps with that, especially when you have to have a quicker cadence and have to be able to go quicker than the other guys.\u201d\n\nThe performances ultimately gave Jay the momentum he needed prior to the U.S. National Championships \u2014 Wasatch Powderkeg \u2014 at Solitude Mountain Resort in Utah from Jan. 8-12. In his first race of the five-day competition, McDonald took sixth overall alongside Collin Kryger in the U18 men\u2019s relay race. Following in 12th place were John McDonald and Max Trachtenberg.\n\nMore familiar with the venue and the setting, Jay bounced back on the second day of competition to take third overall in the sprint race on Thursday, Jan. 9.\n\nTwo days later on Saturday, Jan. 11, the McDonalds lined up for the individual race, and both athletes finished within the top 15. Jay took ninth overall in the race, and John took 14th overall.\n\nJohn McDonald, left, and Jay McDonald prepare to compete at the U.S. National Ski Mountaineering Championships at Solitude Mountain in Utah. Myrth McDonald/Courtesy photo\n\nWith just the vertical race left, Jay and John took to the start line for the final time on Sunday, Jan. 12, prepared to end nationals on a strong note.\n\nThough neither athlete had expectations of placing high enough to be considered for the U.S. team that will attend the 2025 World Championships, Jay found himself near the front of the pack about midway through the race.\n\nRecognizing he had a chance to place within the top two in order to be one of the favorites to represent Team USA in March, McDonald dug deep, pushing aggressively throughout the rest of the 2-mile climb up to the terminal of the Powderhorn II lift at Solitude.\n\nJay crossed the finish line a minute and 39 seconds behind Benjamin Bigwood to take second overall. John earned his best finish of the national competition, taking 10th overall in the U18 men\u2019s vertical race.\n\nAfter feeling dissatisfied at how the fall cross-country season ended, McDonald could not have been more ecstatic about seeing his hard work and dedication pay off during the winter ski mountaineering season.\n\n\u201cIt meant a lot especially coming off a cross-country season where I didn\u2019t get what I wanted,\u201d Jay said. \u201cTo be able to do that in skimo and get fitter, stronger \u2014 felt great. It was special.\u201d\n\nJay McDonald, front, competes in the sprint race at the 2025 U.S. National Championships at Solitude Mountain from Jan. 8-12. Myrth McDonald/Courtesy photo\n\nMost likely sealing a spot on the World Championship team, Jay will now continue to prepare for the competition in Morgins, Switzerland, by training with Team Summit and attending a race in Santa Fe next weekend.\n\nIf Jay is indeed named to the World Championship team by USA Skimo, it would be his first opportunity to represent Team USA.\n\n\u201cI am pretty excited to see Switzerland and give it another go to see how fit I am then,\u201d McDonald said.\n\nFellow Summit County resident Finn Brown took third in the U18 boys vertical race while Breckenridge\u2019s Ashley Adkins took third in the U18 girls vertical race. Additionally, Brown finished fourth in the individual race.\n\nAshley Adkins competes at the 2025 U.S. National Championships at Solitude Mountain Resort in Utah. Myrth McDonald/Courtesy photo\n\nSummit County\u2019s Sam Burke and Grace Staberg win races\n\nIn addition to Jay McDonald\u2019s performance in the U18 races, Dillon\u2019s Sam Burke and Breckenridge\u2019s Grace Staberg also finished highly at the national championships in Utah.\n\nBurke and Staberg each won their respective individual races on Saturday, Jan. 11. Burke completed the men\u2019s U23 race in 1:45:36.1 while Staberg won the women\u2019s U23 race in 2:09.32.1. Burke then doubled back in the vertical race to take second overall to Bayden Menton. Staberg on the other hand, won the women\u2019s U23 vertical and sprint races.\n\nLike McDonald, Burke and Staberg will await to see if they are officially named to the U.S. World Championship team by USA Skimo.\n\nThe International Ski Mountaineering Federation\u2019s 2025 World Championships are slated for March 3-8.",

Its comps decreased for the second straight quarter.\n\n\n\nThe company experienced negative comparable store sales in its internationally operated markets, reflecting broad-based pressure and more cautious spending by customers. Segmental comps decreased 2.1% against the 8.3% growth in the year-ago quarter. The performance of the segment was affected by declining comparable sales in several markets, with France and the U.K. being significant contributors to this downturn. In the IDL segment, comparable sales registered a 3.5% decline against 10.5% growth in the prior-year quarter. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East and declining comparable sales in China outweighed the positive sales performance in Latin America.\n\n\n\nHigher labor continues to squeeze margins. In the United States, wage expenses have risen above mid-single digits in the third quarter of 2024 due to increases in California and broader wage hikes. Commodity costs also remain a concern.\n\n\n\nGiven the global economic uncertainties and shifting consumer preferences, McDonald\u2019s faces a complex environment that complicates efforts to drive profitable growth. Management\u2019s ability to balance cost pressures while maintaining competitive pricing will be critical.\n\n\n\nA recent E. coli outbreak linked to contaminated slivered onions used in McDonald\u2019s products across multiple U.S. states has reignited food safety concerns. Although the company quickly addressed the issue by removing the affected ingredients, such incidents have the potential to tarnish brand trust and hurt consumer loyalty. Any further lapses in food safety could magnify reputational risks.",

(KCTV) - In order to expand the number of rooms available to sick children, the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Kansas City is pursuing the opportunity to purchase land at Longfellow Park.\n\nThe 3.42 acres at 25th and Gillham that could be sold to the charity will be on the April 8, 2025, Kansas City, Missouri, ballot.\n\nAs part of the charity\u2019s current agreement with the City of Kansas City, Ronald McDonald House pays the Kansas City Department of Parks & Recreation $1 per year to lease Longfellow Park, where the 41-bedroom Ronald McDonald House has been for the past 20 years.\n\nRMHC currently pays the costs to maintain the park\u2019s entire area, including the greenspace surrounding it.\n\nRenderings for a proposed expansion of Kansas City's Ronald McDonald House at Longfellow Park. (Courtesy Ronald McDonald House Charities)\n\n\u201cThe most viable option for the charity to serve more families, while keeping guest families within walking distance of their child\u2019s healthcare access (primarily at Children\u2019s Mercy downtown), is to expand the Ronald McDonald House in and on Longfellow Park,\u201d the charity said in a release shared Thursday.\n\nMackenzie Wise uses the service often. She travels with her son from Oklahoma multiple times a year for appointments in Kansas City.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to know that this is here that we have a place that we can take a moment. You know you want to be there for your child but then also you have to take care of yourself so this space allows that for our family,\u201d she said.\n\nExpansion would allow for 40 additional bedrooms and could serve 1,400 more families per year. RMHC said it seeks to purchase the land from the City and would fundraise to cover costs of any expansion.\n\nThe ballot measure would not cost Kansas City residents any money. RMHC said it plans to also preserve the current walking path and 1.5 acres of publicly accessible green space.\n\nCopyright 2025 KCTV. All rights reserved.",

Eighty-seven of those 90 days in jail are stayed pending Berra successfully completing probation. He was given credit for the remaining three days for time already served.\n\nBerra was arrested on Oct. 8 for hitting a police officer and disorderly conduct at the Sartell McDonald's.\n\nBerra, who pleaded guilty, ordered dinner from the fast food restaurant. He wanted to watch the staff make his meal. When Berra, who recently turned 50, went into the restaurant's kitchen, he was told only staff was allowed there, according to reports.\n\nThe initial arrest: Man tased by police, arrested after Sartell McDonald's fight\n\nCourt records allege Berra refused to leave the kitchen at first and became aggressive when the employee came back with a manager. The situation allegedly escalated to Berra shoving the McDonald\u2019s manager twice, using obscene language and threats.\n\nA Sartell Police Department officer arrived at the McDonalds at roughly 4:30 p.m. to find employees and customers standing in the parking lot, according to the criminal complaint. When the officer responded to the scene, the complaint states, Berra kept walking toward the officer despite being told not to.\n\nThe officer then dispatched his Taser at Berra, according to the court filing. Upon recovering from the stun gun, he walked toward the parking lot as another officer entered the restaurant. The officer once again used a Taser on the convicted defendant as he was trying to leave.\n\nBerra defecated on himself after being hit from the stun gun the second time, court records state. He was taken under custody and kept at the Stearns County Jail for three days until he was released on bail, according to a release order.\n\nPlacing Berra under arrest proved to be difficult for the responding officers, court records state. Berra allegedly hit one officer when he kicked backwards at him. Records state he threatened to headbutt the authorities and kick out the squad car\u2019s window.\n\nI-94 crash: Semitruck loses control near St. Joseph, enters center median, then Sauk River\n\nIn addition to probation, Berra was ordered to undergo substance abuse and mental health assessments, according to Schmidt.\n\nThe court also barred Berra from entering the Sartell McDonald's and contacting the case's victims.\n\nBerra was convicted of misdemeanor charges for assaulting a peace officer and fifth-degree assault, according to court records. Additional charges for obstructing the legal process, disorderly conduct and another fifth degree assault were dismissed.\n\nBerra previously pleaded guilty to a 2021 misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge, which, according to a sentencing order, he served three days in jail and paid a $1,000 fine for.\n\nThe 2021 incident took place at the Kwik Trip at 105 Second St. S. in Sartell. A police report states Berra was yelling profanities at a customer and pushed someone who tried to intervene.\n\nCorey Schmidt covers politics and courts for the St. Cloud Times.

Readers have let me know Croce was here.\n\nI wrote in a recent column that I was unsure if Croce had performed here.\n\nIn that column I attempted to compile a list of renowned acts and public figures who performed or spoke decades ago at McDonald Arena, which opened in 1940 on the Missouri State University campus.\n\nJim Croce (Photo from Wikipedia)\n\nI\u2019ve heard from many readers about that column. They made three major points.\n\nA. Croce was here\n\nB. His concert was outstanding, memorable and, in light of his death that year, bittersweet. (Croce was 30 when he died.)\n\nC. McDonald Arena continued to host acts and speakers after the much larger Hammons Student Center opened in 1976. Those acts included Cheap Trick in 1982, Asleep at the Wheel in 1980, Todd Rundgren and Utopia in 1980 and Arlo Guthrie in 1978.\n\nHere\u2019s what readers had to say about the column and the Jim Croce concert.\n\nMike Magers: \u201cIt was probably the best concert I have ever been to. It was just Jim, walking out to the center of the basketball floor with his guitar. He sat on a high stool with a microphone stand and performed for around two hours\n\n\u201cNo other acts, no backup singers, just an extremely talented performer doing what he loved. There was a great connection between him and the crowd which in McDonald Arena wasn\u2019t that large.\n\n\u201cI seem to remember the tickets were $10 with student ID. It was devastating to hear he had died so soon afterwards.\u201d\n\nJean Maneke: \u201cI was at the Croce concert in 1973. I was a freshman at MSU and a member of the student union board \u2014 the group that planned concerts.\n\n\u201cI have no recollection of seeing any promotional materials or such for this concert.\u201d\n\n(I have known Jean for years while she served as legal counsel for newspapers throughout Missouri through the Missouri Press Association.)\n\nHarold Lochner: \u201cI was at the Jim Croce concert in McDonald Arena in the early seventies. \u2026 I just remember it was him, another guy on a guitar, and I think there was a third guy on a piano. I don\u2019t think it was a sold-out concert.\u201d\n\nScot Franson: \u201cGreat show! I attended with my neighbor/friend Greg Payton. One of my first live concerts. Our seats were like on the 6th row on the floor. I was about 18. It hit me hard when he died.\u201d\n\nTerry Bond: \u201cFrom the fall of 1967 to 1970, I saw The 5th Dimension perform there and heard Strom Thurmond speak. I preferred the former.\n\n\u201cIn the 1980s, the Springfield Symphony and a very large choir performed Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 9. The acoustics were appalling, but it was a noble effort.\n\n\u201cDuring those undergraduate years, I took several physical education courses in that facility, from wrestling to social dance to tennis. I took a tennis class in the spring 1969 semester and my instructor was Charlie Spoonhour, then an assistant coach for men\u2019s basketball. (Spoonhour left and later returned to Southwest Missouri State to become the head men\u2019s basketball coach, a position he held from 1983 to 1992.)\n\n\u201cSMS was a casual place with a much smaller enrollment, and Arthur Mallory (president 1964-1971) worked out in McDonald and then walked back to the A Building, striking up conversations with nobody students like me.\u201d\n\nJudy Freeman: \u201cYour story about McDonald Arena got me thinking about (an) Arlo Guthrie\u2019s show there in 1978. We were new to Missouri, and Arlo was one of our favorite artists, so this was a thrill!\n\n\u201cIt was a great show, as expected, but something we had never experienced before was his complete ban on smoking. If anyone happened to light up, an usher with a coffee can would show up and ask them to deposit the offending smoke into the receptacle.\u201d\n\nLinda Hills: \u201cI am a long-time violinist with the Springfield Symphony Orchestra. I believe we closed our 1973-1974 Season with a May 1974 concert at McDonald Arena featuring \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019s\u2019 bandleader/trumpeter Doc Severinsen.\n\n\u201cYou mentioned Peter, Paul, and Mary. During their 1963 performance at McDonald Arena they used my mother\u2019s (physical education instructor) office next to the girls\u2019 locker room as their makeshift \u201cGreen Room.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, not a musical performance, but at McDonald Arena one evening in the late 1990s Dr. Ruth Westheimer gave a most interesting talk.\u201d\n\n(\u201cDr. Ruth\u201d was a sex therapist and talk-show host.)\n\nBrian Ranft: \u201cMcDonald Arena was still used into the 2000s for smaller shows that weren\u2019t big enough for Hammons Student Center or the Juanita K. Hammons Hall for the Performing Arts.\n\n\u201cI remember seeing Tone Loc perform there somewhere around 2004. I went with my then girlfriend, now wife, and her little sister.\n\n\u201cTone Loc was a famous 1990s rapper known for his raspy voice and hits \u2018Funky Cold Medina\u2019 and \u2018Wild Thing\u2019 \u2014 both of which will get people in my 45-55 year-old age bracket singing along and playing the drums whether they want to or not.\n\n\u201cMy standout memory from this show was that there was apparently some issue with the recorded backing track for \u2018Wild Thing\u2019 so he had to get a stage tech to come out and play the iconic drum solo that kicks off the song. \u2026 How cool would it have been to get to play it on stage for Tone Loc? \u2026 Thanks for the memory!\u201d\n\nThis is Pokin Around column No. 243.",

            "content": "Tennessee State University removes band director, launches investigation\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Tennessee Voices: A conversation with Dwayne Tucker Dwayne Tucker, chief executive officer of LEAD Public Schools, spoke with The Tennessean Opinion and Engagement Director David Plazas. Nashville Tennessean\n\nTennessee State University has removed Reginald McDonald, the director of its Grammy-winning marching band, and placed him on paid administrative leave as school leaders carry out an investigation, TSU interim President Dwayne Tucker announced in a news release Thursday.\n\n\"This decision concerns outstanding travel requisitions and advances and related lack of compliance with TSU policies and procedures,\" Tucker said in the release. \"Dr. McDonald will be on administrative leave with full pay while we continue this investigation.\"\n\nThe band, known as The Aristocrat of Bands, is a beloved part of the vibrant culture at the historically Black, public university in Nashville. McDonald held various leadership roles with the band for the last 23 years and has served as its director since 2015, according to a LinkedIn profile under his name. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTucker served on the TSU board from April through when he took on leadership of the university in December. He said he quickly got to work with the board's audit committee as the university faces dire financial straits after a year of major leadership upheavals. The decision to remove McDonald from his position, place him on leave and investigate came after an internal audit.\n\n\"As this is an ongoing personnel matter, I will not be able to comment further about it at this time,\" Tucker said in the release. \"What I can say is that this difficult decision, and any that come here forward, have at their core a shared commitment to ensuring a bright and stable future for Tennessee State University.\"\n\nIn October, the university cut back on road games for the band as the school underwent layoffs and a freeze on hiring and nonessential spending.\n\nMore: Tennessee State Aristocrat of Bands football road game travel cut back over financial constraints\n\nTSU navigates financial issues, advocates press for underfunding restoration\n\nLast year, Tennessee Republican lawmakers voted to oust the entire TSU board after back-to-back audits and years of financial scrutiny. Longtime TSU President Glenda Glover also resigned in June \u2014 a move she said lawmakers encouraged.\n\nThe new board swiftly appointed Ronald A. Johnson as an interim president in July. However, he resigned abruptly in December, citing differences with the board on how best to lead the university forward. The board then appointed Tucker to the role.\n\nQuestions have swirled over Glover's continuing ties to the university after Johnson and his team revealed evidence of years of financial mismanagement and wildly fluctuating budget deficits in recent years. Records obtained by The Tennessean showed that the previous board made a $1.7 million, four-year agreement with Glover that included a payout and an ongoing, paid advisory role.\n\nIt's not clear if Glover is still being paid, or if her contract is still active. TSU Board Chair Dakasha Winton said Glover's contract is the subject of legal review and referred questions to the Tennessee Attorney General's office, which declined to comment on the matter.\n\nAmid pressure from state officials to sell property, make more staff cuts and even declare financial exigency, Tucker said he's committed to stabilizing TSU's finances. He also told state lawmakers that he's personally committed to cutting all ties between TSU and Glover.\n\nMeanwhile, advocates have continued to press for the restoration of $2.1 billion in underfunding to TSU by the state of Tennessee, which happened over the course of 30 years. The federal government revealed that figure in 2023 and recently sent a letter urging Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee to take action to address the matter.",

However, the QSR still plans to open two smaller-format units of the drive-thru beverage concept this year.

The company noted that customers can customize drinks with popping boba, flavor syrups, plus energy and vitamin C shots; and that the design would feature four drive-thru lanes, no dining room and a smaller footprint than a typical McDonald\u2019s. The first location was described as being more similar to Dutch Bros or Starbucks, with a beverage-heavy menu and minimal food options.\n\nSome of CosMc\u2019s best-selling beverages include the energy drink Island Pick-Me-Up Punch, the Sour Energy Burst and the Churro Cold Brew Frappe, according to McDonald\u2019s. CosMc\u2019s Savory Hashbrown Bites is the top-selling food item, reported Restaurant Business News.",

Baltimore City Police Department chaplains, commanders, officers, and local ministers gathered at the restaurant on Wednesday to offer comfort and solace.\n\n\"If it's with a prayer, if it's with a word of comfort.

Candace Parker, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Breanna Stewart and a number of other high-profile athletes have competed in the McDonald's All-American Game.\n\nMore than 800 boys and girls high school basketball players from around the nation were nominated, and McDonald's will announce the final roster later this month.

Leah passed away peacefully at home surrounded by her family after a courageous, four-year battle with medulloblastoma.\n\nLeah leaves behind countless beloved family and friends from throughout her life. She is survived by her adoring parents, Neal Ellis and Elena Proakis Ellis, her beloved brother, Jack Ellis, her loving grandparents, Felia and John Proakis and Michael Ellis, her godparents, Betty Themeles and Christopher Ellis, and her many loving aunts, uncles, and cousins. She also leaves behind her sweet dog, Duffy. She is predeceased by her paternal grandmother, Louise Vetterling Ellis, and her Grammy, Jackie Elaine Carmody. Leah will be sorely missed by her wonderful community of friends, teachers, and admirers in Wakefield and beyond.\n\nLeah lived her entire life in her home in the Greenwood section of Wakefield, MA. She attended preschool at the Stoneham YMCA Academy, followed by K-4 at the Greenwood Elementary School, and fifth to seventh grade at the Galvin Middle School. Leah adored school and learning of all kinds. She excelled at math and writing and aspired to go to college and become a librarian. Trips with Dad to the Beebe Library were a highlight of any day.\n\nLeah had boundless enthusiasm for life, including music, dance, crafts, animals (especially horses, hamsters, and dogs), homework, scouting, summer camp, trips to Cape Cod, helping others through charitable causes, and, most of all, time spent with family and friends. Leah was an avid lover of music and dance. Her classes at Dance Track were one of her favorite activities, and she loved to practice dance at home. Leah loved pop music and movie soundtracks and jumped at the chance to DJ on any car ride. She also loved crafts, including crocheting in recent years. This past year she achieved a long-time goal of starting her own YouTube channel, which she named Lucky Leah. Leah truly felt lucky and would frequently tell her family how much she loved her life, aside from having cancer. She never wanted to be defined by her illness, and she was inspirational to many for her ability to focus on the people and activities she loved. She was often told that her beautiful smile could light up any room.\n\nLeah's strength, love, and smile will be sorely missed by her loving family, friends, Wakefield community, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church family, Camp Casco counselors and campers, and care team at the Dana Farber Jimmy Fund Clinic.\n\nThe Ellis family invites you to calling hours at the McDonald Funeral Home, 19 Yale Ave., Wakefield on Friday January 17 from 2:00 \u2013 6:00 p.m. Funeral and burial services will be private. The family welcomes all to attend a celebration of Leah\u2019s life in the coming weeks, with details to follow.\n\nLeah loved bright colors, so in honor of Leah please wear colorful attire to the calling hours. Thank you.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Leah's memory can be made to Ironstone Farm (https://ironstonefarm.org/), Camp Casco (https://www.campcasco.org/), or the Medulloblastoma Initiative (https://mbinitiative.org/en/). May her memory be eternal.\n\nThe family welcomes all to attend a celebration of Leah\u2019s life on April 5, 2025 at 12:00 PM at the Americal Civic Center, 467 Main Street, Wakefield, MA.

Cheddar\n\nA group opposed to affirmative action filed a lawsuit accusing McDonald's MCD.N of not going far enough when it recently rolled back several diversity initiatives by continuing to maintain a program that awards scholarships to Latino and Hispanic students.\n\nAmerican Alliance for Equal Rights, a group founded by affirmative action foe Edward Blum, in a lawsuit filed on Sunday in federal court in Nashville, alleged the decades-old scholarship program unlawfully discriminates against students from other ethnic groups.\n\nSince its launch in 1985, McDonald's says its HACER National Scholarships Program has awarded more than $33 million in college scholarships to Hispanic and Latino students. Up to 30 students annually receive up to $100,000 through the program.\n\nBlum's group says that by restricting eligibility to students who have at least one parent of Hispanic or Latino heritage, the program discriminates against other students, including one of the group's members, a white high school student in Arkansas.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the program violates Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, a Civil War-era law that bars racial bias in contracting, and asks a judge to issue an injunction blocking McDonald's from considering the race and ethnicity of scholarship applicants.\n\n\"It is our hope that McDonald\u2019s immediately pauses this scholarship program so it can be opened to all under-resourced high school students regardless of their ethnic heritage,\" Blum said in a statement.\n\nMcDonald's in a statement said it was reviewing the complaint. It added that as part of its announcement last week about changes to its diversity initiatives, it was reviewing programs to ensure they \"align with our vision moving forward.\"\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion: McDonald\u2019s flip in DEI beef serves up another win for conservative critics\n\nThe Chicago-based company on Jan. 6 announced it was retiring its goal for diversity in corporate leadership and shifting away from some diversity practices, citing a \"shifting legal landscape\" in the United States.\n\nOther companies including Walmart WMT.N have similarly been backing away from diversity practices following pressure from conservative activists.\n\nMcDonald's cited a ruling last year by the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court that barred the consideration of race as a factor in college admissions. That decision came in lawsuits successfully pursued by a different group founded by Blum.\n\nBlum's American Alliance for Equal Rights and others have since that decision pursued a series of cases challenging corporate diversity initiatives including scholarship and fellowship programs designed to benefit underrepresented minority groups.\n\nA federal judge last month declined to dismiss a lawsuit Blum's group filed against Southwest Airlines LUV.N claiming that a now-defunct program that awarded free flights to Hispanic college students was racially discriminatory.\n\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Bill Berkrot",

However, this isn't necessarily a sign that the small-format side business is going under: Although at least two Texas locations appear to be closing, two new ones will also be built in the Lone Star State.\n\nSome CosMc's stores were built from the ground up to be just that, while a few other locations were actually larger. Former McDonald's locations were repurposed for the experiment. According to the company, the concept works much better in the smaller spaces originally built to accommodate the more limited beverage-and-snack lineup.\n\n\"Since opening CosMc\u2019s, we have had the benefit of testing out different location sizes and setups \u2014 from revamping larger restaurant spaces to building smaller prototype locations that focus more on the drive-thru and digital experience,\" McDonald's said in the statement. \"We learned that the smaller format stores allow us to test new, unique circumstances that are reflective of our customer base.\"\n\nHere's what we know about the closing locations and the future of CosMc's.\n\nMore restaurant closures: Denny's closing 150 restaurants, including 50 by the end of 2024\n\nWhat is CosMc's?\n\nCosMc's is a new spinoff restaurant idea from McDonald's. McDonald's CEO and president Christopher Kempczinski described it as \"a small format concept with all the DNA of McDonald\u2019s but its own unique personality.\"\n\nThe theme leans into the space-based, futurism-of-the-past aesthetic associated with a mascot named CosMc, who appeared in ads in the late '80s and early '90s.\n\nThe menu features teas and lemonades, coffees, slushies, frappes and signature fruit energy-style drinks called \"Galactic Boosts.\" Some highlights include a Turmeric Spiced Latte, S'mores Cold Brew, Churro Frappe and Sour Cherry Energy Burst.\n\nThe food menu is a little more limited but equally unique, featuring a Spicy Queso Sandwich, a Creamy Avocado Tomatillo Sandwich, Pretzel Bites, Savory Hash Brown Bites, a snack box and stuffed pastry bites called McPops. There are also cookies, sundaes, McFlurries, ice cream and three traditional McMuffin options.\n\nIn its first month of operation, the Bolingbrook, Illinois location reported that CosMc's doubled the number of total visits and tripled the number of visitors per square foot compared to an average McDonald's.\n\nHow many CosMc's are currently open? See map of Texas locations\n\nSince Dec. 7, 2023, CosMc's opened one location in Illinois and six in Texas. The inaugural location is in Bolingbrook, Illinois, and the rest are spread across the Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington and San Antonio areas of Texas.\n\nWhich CosMc's locations are closing?\n\nCosMc's did not explicitly disclose which locations were set to close and did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nComparing the CosMc's \"locations\" page from previous weeks to now, however, shows that the two Texas stores were removed from the \"locations\" list:\n\nWatauga: 7304 Denton Hwy\n\nArlington: 300 East Abram St Ste 150\n\nAnother Texas location, at 861 W Stacy Road in Allen, is still listed as \"coming soon.\"\n\nWhen and where will the new CosMc's locations open?\n\nMcDonald's has yet to release the exact location and opening information. The company said it will open two new smaller format stores in Texas in 2025.\n\nCosMc's recap: Favorite customer products from the menu so far\n\nAfter a year of operations, CosMc's has been able to suss out their most popular and best-selling items. According to the statement, these include:\n\nFavorite drinks:\n\nIsland Pick Me Up Punch\n\nChurro Cold Brew Frappe\n\nSour Energy Burst\n\nFavorite bites:\n\nSavory Hashbrown Bites\n\nMcPops\n\nClick here to see CosMc's full menu.\n\n\u2014 USA TODAY contributed to this report.",

It\u2019s seemingly becoming an essential part of doing business in today\u2019s fast-food landscape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAI-powered kiosks and voice-ordering systems allow brands to track customer preferences, suggest orders, and even adjust items in real-time. Some chains use these tools to meet growing demand from loyalty members, while others leverage AI to speed up drive-thrus and product production. Ultimately, the goal of AI is to boost efficiency, accuracy, and sales. Across the industry, companies say AI is freeing up staff to focus on customer service and improve the overall experience.\n\nBut there are potential downsides. Companies typically turn to automation while cutting jobs. Yet, some employers have stressed that AI won\u2019t eliminate jobs, but rather shifts tasks, emphasizing how humans employees are still crucial. Not all chains have embraced AI at the same pace. While some are experimenting with AI for ads, others are using it to track ingredient usage and reduce waste.\n\nIn the rapidly changing fast-food sector, AI\u2019s role is clear: It\u2019s more than rapid meal making; It\u2019s about creating a more efficient, personal, and profitable experience.

The company said that it also engaged with shareholders and benchmarked its own approach to other companies that are also re-evaluating their programs.\n\nKey changes unveiled by the company included retiring the setting of aspirational representation goals, and retiring the supply chain Mutual Commitment to DEI pledge. McDonald\u2019s DEI goals included targets to reach 45% women globally and 35% underrepresented groups in the U.S. in leadership roles by the end of 2025.

The chain cited a review it conducted in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 ruling on affirmative action as a factor behind the decision.\n\nAAER alleged McDonald\u2019s, despite its changes, continues to employ discriminatory practices through its HACER scholarship program, which awards up to $100,000 annually to up to 30 students. The scholarship\u2019s eligibility requirements state applicants must \u201chave at least one parent of Hispanic/Latino heritage,\" the lawsuit claims.\n\nMcDonald's notes on its website over $33 million in HACER scholarships have been \"awarded to Hispanic and Latino students across the country.\"\n\nThis kind of discrimination was never lawful, even before Harvard held that colleges cannot use race or ethnicity in admissions,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cNo racial discrimination is benign.\u201d\n\nEdward Blum, the head of AAER, also leads the organization behind the lawsuits against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina which preceded the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision.\n\nAAER, according to the lawsuit, has members who \u201care ready and able to apply to McDonald\u2019s current contest for high schoolers graduating in 2025.\u201d These members, the group alleges, are being harmed by McDonald\u2019s \u201cracially discriminatory program.\u201d\n\n\u201cMember A is able and ready to apply for the HACER scholarship, once a court orders the program to be equally open to all ethnicities,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cMember A is able to apply because, except for the requirement of being Hispanic, she otherwise satisfies all of the contest\u2019s \u201celigibility requirements.\u201d She\u2019s a high-school senior. She\u2019s a U.S. citizen. She\u2019s 17 years old. She has a 3.8 GPA.\u201d\n\nThe complaint closes by asking the court to declare HACER violates Americans\u2019 rights to equal treatment under the law and to issue an order preventing HACER from closing its current application window. The document also asks the court to require HACER to allow applicants of all races and award AAER $1 in nominal damages.\n\nWhen reached for comment, McDonald's told The National News Desk (TNND) it is \"reviewing the complaint\" and will \"respond to it accordingly.\"\n\n\"However, McDonald\u2019s announced its evolution on our inclusion work last week, and part of that process will be reviewing programs, in partnership with our franchisees as applicable, to ensure these programs align with our vision moving forward,\" the company added.\n\nAmong the DEI changes announced by McDonald\u2019s last week was a tweak to the title of its diversity team, which will now reflect a broader commitment to \u201cinclusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are retiring Supply Chain\u2019s Mutual Commitment to DEI pledge in favor of a more integrated discussion with suppliers about inclusion as it relates to business performance,\u201d McDonald\u2019s wrote. \u201cWe are evolving how we refer to our diversity team, which will now be the Global Inclusion Team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis name change is more fitting for McDonald\u2019s in light of our inclusion value and better aligns with this team\u2019s work,\u201d it added.\n\nJackson Walker on X at @_jlwalker_ for the latest trending national news.

            "content": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) - A Colorado Springs-based supplier, which was linked to a deadly E. coli outbreak, is responding to the results of an inspection done by the FDA.\n\nThe inspection was done after more than a hundred people nationwide became sick and one person died from E. coli in October. Health officials linked the outbreak to slivered onions, initially finding the contaminated onions were used in quarter pounders from McDonald\u2019s.\n\nUpon further investigation, those onions were found to have been sourced from Taylor Farms, a Colorado Springs-based company. McDonald\u2019s told 11 News they were going to immediately stop sourcing their onions from Taylor Farms after the discovery, highlighting what they called their commitment to food safety.\n\nThe two companies were recently named in a lawsuit linked to a woman who says she got sick after eating a hamburger at a Colorado Springs McDonald\u2019s.\n\nTaylor Farms had supplied onions to McDonald\u2019s restaurants across the country. They also sell salad kits through retailers like Safeway, King Soopers and Walmart.\n\nIn an inspection done November of 2024, the results of which were obtained by CBS from the FDA, three key observations were made.\n\nObservation one detailed sanitation prevention control, listing several instances where an inspector found the risk for food contamination was high.\n\nThese included cutting boards being observed to be discolored and cracked, an observed lack of handwashing, and what an inspector said were visibly dirty surfaces.\n\nAccording to the inspection results, apparent biofilm and food debris was found on surfaces, including a slicer, that were signed off as \u201cpass\u201d for visual cleanliness. The inspector notes that they believe these surfaces should have been marked as \u201cfail\u201d and, therefore, they said food should not have come into contact with them.\n\nObservation two noted a lack of cleanliness check documents.\n\nThe report said documents titled \u201cPre-Op Inspection from Today 9/24/2024 and 10/5/2024\u2033 were missing. According to the report, these are used for monitoring and verifying sanitation control.\n\nObservation three noted a higher risk of food contamination, saying employees did not conduct operations to minimize contamination.\n\nThe report said, \u201cequipment is constantly wet due to the wet processing environment and cold temperatures.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, sanitizer was applied to tools, but the tools were not dried. The inspector noted the solution could have been transferred to the food these tools were being used on. The FDA also said employees with gloved hands were observed to have touched other surfaces, such as a hose on the floor, while handling food contact surfaces.\n\nYou can read the full report here.\n\nTaylor Farms spoke with 11 News, responding to the inspection results.\n\nTaylor Farms is confident in our best-in-class food safety processes, and in turn, the quality and safety of our products. As is common following an inspection, FDA issued three observations of conditions that could be improved at one of our facilities. We immediately took steps to address the three observations made in the report and responded with our corrective actions. The FDA has since classified this inspection as \u201cvoluntary action indicated,\u201d meaning the agency \u201cis not prepared to take or recommend any administrative or regulatory action.\u201d This is consistent with the fact that no illnesses or public health threat has been linked to these observations. We know that maintaining trust with our customers and consumers is essential and we are committed to preserving that trust. Our vision of creating healthy lives continues to be important, and we remain deeply committed to delivering the safest, healthiest fresh foods possible to our customers.\n\nTaylor Farms also told 11 News they wanted to specify that the items listed in the inspection were observations, not violations, noting the word \u201cviolation\u201d was never used in the FDA report.\n\nCopyright 2025 KKTV.

            "content": "GENESEE COUNTY, MI \u2013 When she went to Washington and took the oath of office to become a member of Congress last week, Kristen McDonald Rivet didn\u2019t go alone.\n\nThe Bay City Democrat, elected to her first term on Nov. 5, brought along the whole family, including six children, two of their spouses, both sisters, her in-laws, and her 86-year-old father.\n\n\u201cThat was very meaningful to me,\u201d McDonald Rivet told MLive/The Flint Journal this week. \u201cBoth my parents were very, very poor. My dad was a construction worker. Stepping on the House floor, knowing how important our role is and understanding who had served in that chamber ... I was really \u2013 to be honest \u2013 awestruck.\u201d\n\nMcDonald Rivet won the 8th Congressional District seat by defeating Republican Paul Junge in the general election, becoming the first woman to serve mid-Michigan in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nHer election also marked the first time since 1976 that a member of the Kildee family would not represent the Flint area in the House.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Flint Township, did not seek re-election and endorsed McDonald Rivet rather than several other prominent Democrats, including Flint Mayor Sheldon Neeley, to fill his shoes.\n\nDuring the campaign and in her first days in Congress, McDonald Rivet has planted herself firmly in the center of the party, promising to put problem-solving first and making the attraction of high-paying jobs in the 8th Congressional District her first priority.\n\nShe was selected by her peers to serve as the freshman leadership representative to the New Democratic Coalition, a group of more than 100 Democrats in the 119th Congress who she said share her commitment to \u201cgoverning in the middle and prioritizing economic issues that makes life easier for working families.\u201d\n\nThe approach appealed to voters in the district, which became more Republican after congressional redistricting following the 2020 census.\n\nIn the redistricting, parts of Midland County, including the city of Midland, were added to the 8th District, which stretches from Fenton on the south to the Pinconning area on the north and includes all of the cities of Flint, Saginaw and Bay City.\n\n\u201cWhen I announced my run for Congress, I reached out to the New Dem coalition and really found my ideological home,\u201d McDonald Rivet said.\n\nAlthough the district has a diverse group of communities, the congresswoman said, people she represents are more similar than different.\n\nFamilies worry \u201cabout their ability to afford food and heat and gas to be able to get to work,\u201d McDonald Rivet said. \u201cI heard about that in every corner of the district.\u201d\n\nThe congresswoman said she\u2019ll find out how the bipartisan approach will work with the incoming Trump administration but said she believes \u201cthere are groups of Republicans that are also very interested in working from the middle.\u201d\n\nMcDonald Rivet last month credited her campaign\u2019s focus \u2013 \u201ccontinuously, almost exclusively on pocketbook issues\u201d \u2013 for her success in Michigan in an interview last month with the New York Times.\n\nRelated: Kristen McDonald Rivet explains what went wrong \u2013 and what went right \u2013 in November election\n\nHer victory came despite Trump narrowly defeating Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in Michigan.\n\nMcDonald Rivet said the position she\u2019s staked is in line with her work in the Michigan Senate, where she authored the Working Families Tax Credit and sponsored bills to lower the cost of housing and child care after flipping a redrawn seat from Republican to Democrat in 2022.\n\nMcDonald Rivet previously served as executive director of the Michigan Head Start Association; vice president of Michigan Future, Inc.; president and chief executive officer of Greater Midland Inc.; and chief strategy officer for the Michigan Health Improvement Alliance.\n\nShe is a graduate of Michigan State University and received a master\u2019s degree in education and public administration from the University of Michigan-Flint.\n\nIn Congress, the freshman lawmaker said she has requested committee assignments focused on transportation and infrastructure, small business, and agriculture.\n\nBut she said the pending committee assignments won\u2019t define what she wants to accomplish.\n\n\u201cThe work that you do as an elected leader is not exclusive to committees you serve on,\u201d she said. \u201cThe things that are important to me, I will continue to ... work with whoever sits on the committees when they are assigned.\u201d\n\nMcDonald Rivet grew up in the Portland area, just west of Lansing.\n\nShe\u2019s described her upbringing as typical in the small town where she\u2019s said her mother would care for three children and her father would work 70 to 80 hours a week to make ends meet.\n\nHaving him and the large contingent of family present to start her work in Congress made the moment especially meaningful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big job and we have serious work ahead of us,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just incredibly honored\u201d to do it.",

McDonald's is also ditching a program it created to encourage its suppliers to make their own diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) pledges and invest in diversity training for their employees. Instead, the company says it will have conversations \"with suppliers about inclusion as it relates to business performance.\"\n\nAnother change: McDonald's will refer to its diversity team as the \"Global Inclusion Team.\"\n\n\"This name change is more fitting for McDonald's in light of our inclusion value and better aligns with this team's work,\" the company said. Additionally, McDonald's said it will pause \"external surveys,\" without providing specifics.\n\nMcDonald's follows a slew of high-profile corporations including Ford, Lowe's, John Deere and others, in rolling back its DEI efforts after a Supreme Court ruling reversing affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nFord and other employers have declined to participate in a Human Rights Campaign survey that gauges a company's inclusivity for LGBTQ+ workers.\n\nIn 2024, more than 30% of the company's leaders were from underrepresented groups, McDonald's said in the memo. The company also achieved gender pay equity companywide, according to its 2024 Purpose and Impact Report. On the supplier front, the company last year met its goal of spending 25% on diverse-owned suppliers by 2025.\n\nCrews battle Palisades Fire flare-up in Mandeville Canyon\n\nWendell Pierce: An actor's journey\n\nJamie Dimon on the economy",

            "content": "The Golden Arches still look like a golden investment opportunity.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD 0.95%), the world's largest fast-food chain, is often considered a reliable stock for long-term investors. But over the past 12 months, the stock has stayed nearly flat as the S&P 500 has advanced nearly 24%.\n\nMany investors shunned McDonald's as it grappled with slowing comparable store sales and an E. coli outbreak in the U.S. from September to October 2024. However, that slump might represent a golden buying opportunity for four simple reasons.\n\n1. Its slowdown is caused by temporary headwinds\n\nMcDonald's global comparable store sales declined year over year for two consecutive quarters. The growth of its U.S. business stalled out as its international operated and international developmental licensed markets grappled with declining comps.\n\nComps Growth by Segment Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 U.S. 8.1% 4.3% 2.5% (0.7%) 0.3% International Operated Markets 8.3% 4.4% 2.7% (1.1%) (2.1%) International Developmental Licensed Markets 10.5% 0.7% (0.2%) (1.3%) (3.5%) Global 8.8% 3.4% 1.9% (1%) (1.5%)\n\nHowever, most of that slowdown was caused by temporary headwinds instead of any long-term existential threats to McDonald's core business. Its U.S. business was affected by inflationary headwinds for consumer spending, two major hurricanes, and an E. Coli outbreak. Its international business struggled with slower consumer spending in the U.K. and Europe, as well as the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\n\nSo if you plan to hold McDonald's stock for at least a few years, these near-term challenges shouldn't deter you from buying it today. From 2023 to 2026, analysts expect its revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4%.\n\n2. It's resolving its most pressing issues\n\nMcDonald's is already taking plenty of steps to counter those near-term headwinds. In the U.S., it's launching the popular Chicken Big Mac across more regions, extending its $5 meal deal to attract more customers, and rolling out its mix-and-match McValue menu for a wider range of budget-friendly options.\n\nOn the company's latest conference call, CFO Ian Frederick Borden said McDonald's would also focus on \"restoring consumer confidence\" in the aftermath of the E. Coli outbreak from contaminated onions in 14 states. It still generated 41% of its revenue from the U.S. in the first nine months of 2024, so the stabilization of that core market could offset its other overseas challenges.\n\nIn Europe, it's expanding its cheaper McSmart menu to deal with inflation. On its latest call, Borden said the McSmart menu had sparked \"signs of improvement\" in France and attracted a \"strong initial consumer response\" in Germany. That progress should strengthen the international operated segment, which generated 48% of the company's revenue in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nMcDonald's international developmental licensed segment -- which includes its licensed stores in Latin America, China, and the Middle East -- will likely face more unpredictable macro and geopolitical challenges in the near future. But that segment only accounted for 11% of the top line in the first nine months of 2024 -- and it should stabilize over the next few years.\n\n3. Tech upgrades will drive long-term earnings growth\n\nMcDonald's also continues to lock more customers into its global loyalty programs, which reached 150 million active members (who logged in within the last 90 days) at the end of 2023. It expects to reach 250 million members by the end of 2027.\n\nAs it locks in more customers, it's upgrading its digital platform with more personalized offers. It's also automating more locations to control its labor costs. Moreover, most of McDonald's locations are already franchised, so it generates most of its profits from those higher-margin royalties and fees instead of its company-owned stores.\n\nThose advantages, along with consistent buybacks that reduced its share count by 25% over the past 10 years, should drive its long-term earnings growth. Analysts expect its earnings per share to grow at a steady CAGR of 6% from 2023 to 2026. At $292 a share, the stock still looks reasonably valued at 23 times forward earnings.\n\n4. It's on the verge of becoming a Dividend King\n\nMcDonald pays a forward dividend yield of 2.4%, and it's raised that payout for 48 consecutive years. Another two dividend hikes will make it a Dividend King, an elite title reserved for companies that deliver at least 50 consecutive dividend hikes.\n\nMcDonald's ability to raise its dividend for nearly a half century indicates it's an evergreen investment that has weathered plenty of economic downturns. All of those advantages make it a great stock for long-term investors to buy and hold.",

            "content": "During the height of the racial justice protests that came after Minneapolis police murdered George Floyd, McDonald\u2019s joined the fray of businesses and institutions declaring their solidarity with all those committed to ending racism. In a post on June 3, 2020, on the platform then known as Twitter, McDonald\u2019s shared a short video listing Floyd\u2019s name alongside other Black victims of violence, including Trayvon Martin and Atatiana Jefferson.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s announced this week that it\u2019s stepping away from its previously established DEI goals.\n\nIn muted red and yellow tones, the video read: \u201cHe was one of us; she was one us,\u201d and continued that the \u201centire McDonald\u2019s family grieves.\u201d McDonald\u2019s declared itself in solidarity with \u201cvictims of systemic oppression,\u201d and made it clear that the corporation stands \u201cwith Black communities.\u201d It offered as proof its donations to the Urban League and the NAACP. The video ended with a black screen with white letters: \u201cBlack lives matter.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that McDonald\u2019s will be posting a similar video anytime soon. McDonald\u2019s announced this week that it\u2019s stepping away from some of its previously established DEI goals, retiring a specific DEI pledge and changing the way it refers to its diversity team.\n\nThe gestures made during the summer of 2020 appear to have been compelled more by peer pressure than by principle. Now, leaders of organizations from big-box stores to universities have publicly disavowed policies promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, whose acronym DEI has become shorthand for any and all attempts to address centuries of homogeneity, inequality and exclusion in educational and professional spaces.\n\nIn other sectors, leadership and development support programs for racial and ethnic minorities have been renamed, restructured or simply retired. And in light of the Supreme Court curtailing affirmative action in higher education and a concerted conservative onslaught on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, McDonald\u2019s frames its move as an attempt to pre-empt further court challenges to its diversity efforts.\n\nIn a Jan. 6 open letter to employees and franchisees that acknowledges \u201cthe shifting legal landscape,\u201d the company\u2019s senior leadership team announced what it called \u201ca new concept: the power of OUR \u2018Golden Rule\u2019 \u2014 treating everyone with dignity, fairness and respect, always.\u201d The company says it is:\n\n\u201cretiring setting aspirational representation goals and instead keeping our focus on continuing to embed inclusion practices that grow our business into our everyday process and operations\u201d\n\n\u201cpausing external surveys to focus on the work we are doing internally to grow the business\u201d\n\n\u201cretiring Supply Chain\u2019s Mutual Commitment to DEI pledge in favor of a more integrated discussion with suppliers about inclusion\u201d\n\nand \u201cevolving how we refer to our diversity team, which will now be the Global Inclusion Team.\u201d\n\nMcDonald\u2019s senior leadership said it remains committed to inclusion and believes a diverse workforce is a competitive advantage.\n\nHow it distributes its supply contracts not only impacts which companies get the opportunity to stock McDonald\u2019s restaurants with hamburger buns and sausage patties, but it also impacts workers who prepare these essential goods. \u201cPausing external surveys\u201d means aggrieved employees may have trouble collecting data and information on potentially discriminatory action within the organization.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is among a few corporations that have profited heartily from the idea that they are a friend to Black communities. Long before the summer of 2020, the summer of 1968 (which followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.) spurred soul-searching and reflection about how people in power could be vehicles for social change. Unfortunately, in both eras, many of the proposed solutions pivoted on businesses making commitments to recruit more talent of color while also eyeing the ways that these seemingly pro-social policies could also yield more profits.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has profited heartily from the idea that it is a friend to Black communities.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s had already emerged as a dominant presence in the fast-food world, but in the late 1960s, the company would distinguish itself as leader in what would eventually be called DEI. The first step was recruiting its first Black franchisee, Herman Petty, to reopen a store on Chicago\u2019s South Side in December 1968, and enlisting Black regional managers and advisers to build what would be called \u201cBlack stores.\u201d A numerically modest but economically impactful group of Black franchise owners introduced and revived the brand among urban consumers of color. McDonald\u2019s devoted an advertising budget to create content exclusively for minority media and recruited Black celebrities like Michael Jordan and Gladys Knight for national campaigns, making the company a leading source of contracts for Black-owned radio and TV networks, as well as marketing and consulting firms.\n\nThe McDonald\u2019s logo appeared on material heralding contributions to civil rights organizations, historically Black colleges and universities and cultural initiatives. Many of those actions were initiated and funded by its growing network of Black franchise owners, who tried to hold McDonald\u2019s accountable for contributing to a loyal and critical part of their consumer market.\n\nForty-four years after the first Black franchise owner entered the McDonald\u2019s system, the chain selected Don Thompson, its first Black CEO, in 2012. That felt like a sign that the Golden Arches could recognize Black talent after decades of touting itself as a diversity champion in its recruitment efforts. Much of the company\u2019s success \u2014 from the 1980s until the mid-2000s \u2014 was related to the work of Patricia Sowell Harris, a pioneer in the field of corporate diversity who started her early career at McDonald\u2019s as an affirmative action officer in 1985.\n\nIn light of the national backlash against discussing the nation\u2019s history or racism, it may not come as much of a surprise to those who don\u2019t know the company\u2019s history that McDonald\u2019s is disavowing DEI. But so much of McDonald\u2019s branding strategy for the last 50 years has promoted the chain as not just a place to eat cheap food served fast but as a supporter of the Black community and Black entrepreneurship.\n\nThis thinking and strategy expanded to other communities that gave birth to affinity groups for Latino franchisees, members of the AAPI community, women and LGBTQ people. This was smart business because it was lucrative, but it was also protective business because such demonstrations of appreciating diversity could also be used to deflect serious and important challenges to the labor experiences of its workers, most of whom are people of color.\n\nSo much of McDonald\u2019s branding strategy has promoted the chain as a supporter of the Black community and Black entrepreneurship.\n\nIn recent years, when Black franchisees have organized and filed lawsuits against McDonald\u2019s claiming racial discrimination related to the assignment of restaurants and alleging a lack support during challenging times such as the Covid-19 shutdowns, McDonald\u2019s was able to argue its bona fides in creating Black wealth through franchises and its internal commitment to diversity.\n\nBut with its announcement that it\u2019s retiring certain DEI policies, McDonald\u2019s seems to have concluded that it doesn\u2019t need the diversity talking points anymore, and although it\u2019s one of the most powerful and influential global corporations with a record that speaks volumes about how diversity initiatives have enriched the company, it doesn\u2019t appear to believe that diversity \u2014 no matter how superficial \u2014 is worth fighting for anymore.\n\nIn McDonald\u2019s announcement, the company argued that its \u201cearly and full adoption of inclusion gives us a competitive advantage,\u201d which both recognizes and glosses over the dynamic history that McDonald\u2019s has had in DEI and signals that the company hopes the public will use the past to inform the present. But it\u2019s still uncertain what the future will hold for a company that once touted itself to be a fast-food leader and has revealed that, like most corporations, it\u2019s just a self-interested follower.",

Market St.\n\nBoldt, who brings over 30 years of experience in the industry, grew up working in the family business.\n\nBoldt\u2019s time with McDonald's began at the age of 9, when his father, a McDonald's franchisee, gave him his first job at the family-owned restaurant in Utah.\n\n\"I started working in the gardens, washing windows and doing all the small tasks that nobody else wanted to do. From there, I worked my way up,\" Boldt said.\n\nOver the years, Boldt has worked in many capacities within the business, from maintenance to swing management.\n\nBefore taking on his new role as owner and operator, Boldt served in various leadership positions, including general manager and supervisor for several McDonald\u2019s locations in Indiana. His experience also includes technology, having earned an associate's degree in software engineering, allowing for operational efficiencies and IT solutions across the restaurants he\u2019s managed.\n\n\"Being in the McDonald's business is more than just flipping burgers - it's about creating meaningful relationships, whether with customers or employees,\" Boldt stated. \"I want my employees to feel respected and valued. I lead by example, whether that means working alongside my team or listening to their feedback.\n\n\"My dad taught me the importance of hard work and loyalty. He also encouraged me to pursue a college education before joining the business,\u201d said Boldt.\n\nThe Nappanee McDonald's marks the next milestone in the Boldt family\u2019s relationship with McDonald's, which dates back over 30 years. Boldt\u2019s father opened his first McDonald\u2019s restaurant in the late 1980s in Utah, before expanding into Indiana.\n\nNow, Boldt is committed to giving back to the Nappanee community, joining the Nappanee Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"We\u2019ve had a great relationship with the Nappanee community over the years,\" Boldt stated. \"I\u2019m excited to be here, serve the community and contribute to its growth. I\u2019m here for the long haul. I want to build something that lasts and continues to serve this community for generations to come.\"\n\nBoldt is keeping his family engaged in the business.

So an excuse to come back to Dubai, an excuse to get a lot of seat time in the GT3 platform and get used to the 24-hour format.\n\n\u201cBecause the ultimate goal for a lot further on down the road is more longer endurance stuff.\n\n\u201cJust to get a flavor of going throughout the night, trying to sleep, stuff like that.\u201d\n\nBy his own admission, the 24H Dubai will be McDonald\u2019s longest race to date, having previously taken on the Indianapolis 8 Hour in his debut with DXDT last October as well as the six-hour Porsche Endurance Challenge event at Circuit of The Americas.\n\n\u201cThe limited background I have right now is Porsche Sprint Challenge, which was kind of my main focus in 2024 and 2023,\u201d McDonald said.\n\n\u201cAnd then I mixed in a bit of Super Trofeo in both those years as well. Good stepping stones. I think they\u2019re both great landing areas for the gentleman driver that wants to take it a little bit more serious than club racing.\n\n\u201cAnd then for people like me that are trying to work their way even further, it\u2019s a perfect stepping stone to get there.\u201d\n\nVeteran endurance racer Bell, a former Bentley factory driver in his own right, also previously teamed with McDonald when they tackled the Asian Le Mans Series season in a Nielsen Racing Oreca 07 Gibson alongside Liddy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing Blake from earlier than he\u2019s probably been on the radar in terms of national racing stuff,\u201d said Bell.\n\n\u201cI got to know Blake, as I have done with several other guys, from the Thermal Club in California.\n\n\u201cThe progression from starting there and working up through the series that he\u2019s done has been really impressive. And that\u2019s why Blake\u2019s got some very lofty ambitions.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re entirely achievable. The path that he\u2019s on has been very impressive. And it\u2019s caught the eye of the likes of DXDT and other teams.\n\n\u201cAfter doing that Indy 8 Hour race, the desire to get Blake in the car was very, very strong.\n\n\u201cBlake and I had many meetings about having a very structured growth into endurance racing and into more serious racing.\n\n\u201cThe idea was it would take a while to establish yourself as a good Bronze driver. Then we did the Indy 8 Hour and the phone started ringing off the hook so he seems to have jumped a few rungs of the ladder.\n\n\u201cSo yeah, the progression has been very impressive.\u201d\n\nWhile his 24H Dubai outing is still a few months removed from his full-season GTWC America debut, and in a different car, McDonald maintains there is \u201clots of stuff\u201d he\u2019ll be able to take from this race into his Corvette campaign.\n\n\u201cThe mental preparation is super important, the physical preparation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to take it to that level and if you\u2019re going to be competitive at a GT World Challenge America kind of level, you have to dedicate a large portion of your life towards that every day on off track.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fortunate enough to be in a position in my life where I can dedicate so much time and energy and resources towards it.\n\n\u201cAnd then specifically for this race, being able to shut off your mind in between stints and try to get sleep and just getting used to that 24-hour format I think is really one of the biggest things I\u2019ll be able to take away from this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done long stints, I\u2019m not super worried about that. I\u2019m almost more worried [about] how I am going to be able to sleep in between the stints and how am I going to feel in hours 20 and 21.\n\n\u201cHow is the track going to look? How dirty is the track? How\u2019s the car? Can we keep the car alive mechanically?\n\n\u201cYou have to have a strong stomach to be in endurance racing and that\u2019s mostly why I picked this race specifically.\n\n\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s in Dubai made it the deal all that much sweeter. I love coming here in general. The weather is beautiful. For me, it was a perfect storm of greatness.\n\n\u201cMy birthday was [Thursday], so I got to spend my birthday racing around in Dubai in a Ferrari. I couldn\u2019t imagine a better way of spending it.\u201d",

Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams will shift to a new role, Meta said.\n\nThe company will also stop an effort to work with third-party suppliers that are diverse-owned, Meta said, adding that it would roll back a \"diverse slate\" hiring program that ensured a diverse range of candidates was considered for each open role.\n\nStill, Meta emphasized the importance of making products accessible for all consumers and employing a multi-talented workforce.\n\nThe move follows an announcement from McDonald's earlier this week that the company would end a few initiatives centered on diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI.\n\nWhile emphasizing a \"steadfast\" commitment to \"inclusion,\" the company said it would remove goals for diversity within its senior leadership ranks, and do away with a program that encourages suppliers to conduct diversity training and achieve diversity at the management level.\n\nMeta and McDonald's \u2013 like many of their peers \u2013 pledged to expand DEI commitments in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. In recent years, however, companies have faced pressure to revoke DEI policies amid an upsurge of conservative backlash and a Supreme Court decision effectively ending affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nThe company announcements mark the latest in a string of corporations rolling back their DEI programs, including Walmart and John Deere, experts told ABC News. It remains unclear to what extent the moves will impact worker diversity at the firms, they added.\n\nMcDonald's said it remains committed to inclusion, noting that 30% of its U.S. leaders belong to underrepresented groups. The company previously aimed to attain 35% of such leaders from underrepresented groups by the end of 2025, according to their 2023-24 Purpose & Impact Report.\n\nIn a statement about the policy shift, McDonald's said it \"completed a comprehensive Civil Rights Audit (CRA) that looked at all aspects of inclusion across our system\" and also cited the \"shifting legal landscape\" following the Supreme Court decision on affirmative action in college admissions, as well as \"other companies who are also re-evaluating their own programs.\"\n\nMcDonald's also said it had achieved some of its diversity goals, including spending at least 25% of its budget for third-party suppliers on \"diverse-owned\" companies.\n\n\"The tides have turned,\" Traci Sitzmann, a professor of workforce development at the University of Colorado, Denver who studies corporate diversity, told ABC News. \"Many CEOs are responding to the pushback by retracting these policies.\"\n\nThe Meta (formerly Facebook) logo marks the entrance of their corporate headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Nov. 9, 2022. Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nSome proponents of DEI sharply criticized the policy changes announced by McDonald's.\n\n\"McDonald\u2019s is joining a small but concerning list of companies that once touted the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion, but have now abandoned their values and capitulated to right-wing activists,\" Andrea Abrams, executive director of advocacy group American Pride Rises, told ABC News in a statement.\n\nStill, the exact implications of the recent rollbacks remain unclear, and alarm among DEI advocates may prove overstated, Corinne Post, a professor of management at Villanova University who specializes in diversity programs, told ABC News.\n\nCorporations face competitive pressure to recruit and retain talented workers, giving them incentive to establish an environment where employees of varied identities feel welcome, Post said. She noted that some of the announced changes at McDonald's and elsewhere appear to be \"surface-level\" efforts meant to assuage critics.\n\n\"This is not a fundamental cancellation of DEI policies,\" Post said.\n\nSitzmann, of the University of Colorado, disagreed. The policy changes at these firms suggest that corporate commitment to DEI depends on where public opinion on the issue stands at a given time, Sitzmann said, which risks compromising employee trust and hurting company performance.\n\n\"By being inauthentic in their commitment to diversity, these companies are muddying the waters and hindering their employees' ability to produce,\" Sitzmann said.\n\nHere are some of the companies that have announced rollbacks of their DEI programs:\n\nWalmart\n\nWalmart said in November that it would end some DEI efforts, including the consideration of gender and race in its evaluation of companies participating in its supply chain.\n\nThe retail giant said it didn't currently have quotas and didn't plan to impose them going forward; however, it planned to stop collecting demographic data when determining financing eligibility for grants.\n\nWalmart will be \"reviewing grants to Pride events to make sure it is not financially supporting sexualized content targeting kids,\" the company said, noting that it would also exit the Human Rights Campaign's annual benchmark index, which evaluates companies for their LGBTQ+ inclusion.\n\n\u201cWe've been on a journey and know we aren't perfect,\" the statement continued, \"but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone.\"\n\nThe company said in a statement to ABC News, \"Our purpose, to help people save money and live better, has been at our core since our founding 62 years ago and continues to guide us today. We can deliver on it because we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America.\"\n\nJohn Deere\n\nJohn Deere posted a list of policy changes on X in July, citing a need to prioritize efforts that \"more closely align our business strategy to meet the needs of our customers.\"\n\nThe company said it would no longer participate in or support cultural awareness events, such as parades or festivals. Business Resource Groups \u2013 which connect workers who share racial, gender, sexual orientation or other identities \u2013 would focus solely on work-related topics, the company added.\n\nStill, John Deere affirmed its belief that \"a diverse workforce enables us to best meet our customers' needs and because of that we will track and advance the diversity of our organization.\"\n\nFord Motor President and CEO Jim Farley attends the press day of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, Sept. 13, 2023. Rebecca Cook/Reuters\n\nFord\n\nIn September, Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a memo to employees that the company would no longer pursue some of its DEI initiatives.\n\nThe Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign's annual benchmark index and make identity-based Employee Resource Groups open to all workers, Farley said in the memo, which was posted on X by conservative activist Robby Starbuck.\n\n\"Ford does not utilize hiring quotas or tie compensation to the achievement of specific diversity goals,\" Farley said.\n\nHowever, he added, the company remains \"deeply committed to fostering a safe and inclusive workplace and building a team that leverages diverse perspectives backgrounds and thinking styles.\"\n\nHarley-Davidson\n\nIn August, Harley-Davidson said in a post on X that it had put an end to its DEI efforts months earlier. \"We have not operated a DEI function since April 2024, and we do not have a DEI function today,\" the company said.\n\nThe motorcycle manufacturer would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign and ensure that all employee training is free of \"socially motivated content,\" Harley-Davidson said.\n\nEmployee Resource Groups would focus strictly on professional development and other workplace topics, the company added.\n\n\"We see it as every leader's role to ensure we have an employee base that reflects our customers and the geographies in which we operate,\" Harley-Davidson said.",

            "content": "Greetings, comms pros! Let\u2019s look at a few news stories from the past week and see what we can learn from them.\n\n1. Fires rage through Southern California as over 100,000 evacuate their homes\n\nMajor wildfires continue to burn out of control across the Greater Los Angeles area, forcing over 100,000 metro area residents to evacuate. The wildfires have also forced major disruptions in the city\u2019s lifeblood, the entertainment industry, with awards shows and premieres being canceled out of caution. HBO and MAX released a statement on their decision to cancel the premiere for \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d recognizing first responders and the safety of those in the area.\n\n\u201cOut of an abundance of caution due to the ongoing Palisades Fire and continued wind advisories through tomorrow, we are canceling Wednesday\u2019s premiere event for \u2018The Pitt.\u2019 The safety and well-being of our attendees, staff, and community are our top priority. We are grateful for the first responders bravely working to protect our community, and our thoughts are with those affected. Stay safe!\u201d\n\nDuring natural disasters like these wildfires, it\u2019s key for communicators to ride the line between an informational and empathetic messaging. Late last year, we spoke with Ashley Bush of Southwire about how her team responded to the impacts of Hurricane Helene across the Southeast. Her best practices, which apply across a range of disaster scenarios, included:\n\nA robust intranet can help reach people efficiently. A company\u2019s intranet can serve as a hub for updates on the company\u2019s response to a disaster and directions for employees following evacuations or closures. \u201cIt gives us a timely way to reach people transparently and meaningfully,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAdditionally, the information available to them is customized based on what their role is and where they\u2019re located.\u201d\n\nA company\u2019s intranet can serve as a hub for updates on the company\u2019s response to a disaster and directions for employees following evacuations or closures. \u201cIt gives us a timely way to reach people transparently and meaningfully,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAdditionally, the information available to them is customized based on what their role is and where they\u2019re located.\u201d Share safety measures via all available channels. Providing safety tips to your employees isn\u2019t just a great way to show you care about them \u2014 it can help inform them from a trusted source since the majority of employees place a great deal of trust in their employers. That means sharing information from local authorities on safety best practices. Additionally, using all the channels you have at your disposal maximizes the potential reach of important messaging.\n\nProviding safety tips to your employees isn\u2019t just a great way to show you care about them \u2014 it can help inform them from a trusted source since the majority of employees place a great deal of trust in their employers. That means sharing information from local authorities on safety best practices. Additionally, using all the channels you have at your disposal maximizes the potential reach of important messaging. Communicators can provide pathways to help. Even in the bleakest times, stories of comebacks after a disaster are welcome. Share the news about the disaster, but also share how people are overcoming it when applicable. \u201cBeyond just providing the news, we wanted to show our people that there were ways to help,\u201d Bush said of her team\u2019s response to Helene.\n\n2. McDonald\u2019s retires some diversity goals, citing affirmative action decision by the Supreme Court\n\nFast-food giant McDonald\u2019s is scaling back on some of its DEI commitments while affirming its commitment to \u201cinclusion\u201d in a memo to franchisees. In the note, McDonald\u2019s wrote:\n\n\u201cInclusion\u201d is one of our core values and in 2024 \u201cwe opened our doors\u201d to hundreds of millions of customers and two million crew people from all walks of life. Everyone is welcome under our Golden Arches, and this broad-based appeal is why McDonald\u2019s is one of the world\u2019s most beloved brands. We\u2019re proud of our culture at McDonald\u2019s, and we want to thank all of you for living our values.\n\nSimultaneously, McDonalds also announced changes to its DEI efforts, including the retirement of representation goals and a greater focus on business performance within its \u201cinclusion\u201d pushes.\n\nThe move by McDonald\u2019s follows the trend of DEI work being either scaled back or renamed following public backlash from certain corners of society. But even under another name, inclusion work, as McDonald\u2019s terms it, remains important.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s narrowing in their inclusion is also notable, specifically in how they talk about it. Rather than eschewing inclusion entirely, they redefine it as an internal focus rather than an external one. The memo highlights highs in diverse leadership and a closing gender pay gap, undeniably accomplishments in inclusion. But if it remains a pillar of the business, it needs to be communicated to the people who give the company its identity. Don\u2019t just say that your company appreciates employees; prove it through communicated reminders and actions that lean into that appreciation, including improved compensation and leadership opportunities.\n\n3. JP Morgan mandates a five-day in-office workweek\n\nAdd JP Morgan to the list of major companies calling their employees back to the office full-time. According to a report from Bloomberg, the financial services firm plans to replace its three-day hybrid schedule with the full-time attendance policy it maintained before the pandemic. The move follows derisive comments about remote work from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, claiming \u201cfive is right\u201d in terms of the proper amount of days in the office.\n\nRolling out a return to office is fine in and of itself, but it\u2019s important for companies that choose to do so roll out the RTO process properly. Last year, we wrote about how the key steps to any RTO is centered on cultural alignment. It remains to be seen how JP Morgan will talk about the process internally, but when asking employees to come back to the office, communicators should be sure to remind employees that their contributions are valuable, that they\u2019re part of an organization that\u2019s doing important work, and that the cultural benefits of being in the office will be easily seen. Additionally, creating a space for two-way dialogues about RTO helps show that organizations are invested in every employee, even those who might not agree with the decision to go back to the office every day at the outset.\n\nAdditionally, the leadership communication piece of the puzzle bears importance. Jamie Dimon has been pretty outspoken about his dislike for remote work for a while now, going as far as to say that people who stick to remote work don\u2019t need to work at JP Morgan. \u201cI completely understand why someone doesn\u2019t want to commute an hour and a half every day, totally got it. Doesn\u2019t mean they have to have a job here either,\u201d he told The Economist last year.\n\nIt\u2019s not just what your leaders say about remote work; how they say it matters too. Employees are perceptive and the conversation around RTO and remote work reflect a company\u2019s culture and employer reputation. Bear that in mind when counseling leaders about how to talk about RTO.\n\n4. How about some good news?\n\nHave a great weekend comms all-stars!\n\nSean Devlin is an editor at Ragan Communications.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has modified its development plan for beverage-centric concept CosMc\u2019s and will close three of its larger locations that were remodeled into CosMc\u2019s, the company said Thursday.\n\nThe company will open two smaller CosMc\u2019s locations in Texas this year. McDonald\u2019s didn\u2019t indicate where the new locations would be and which ones closed, but the CosMc\u2019s website lists a location coming in Allen, Texas.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said that CosMc\u2019s works best in smaller locations that have a focus on drive-thru and digital experience. The company originally planned to have nine Texas locations .\n\nDive Insight:\n\nCosMc\u2019s has been so popular that customers have been beset with long drive-thru waits. Smaller locations without dining rooms could help boost drive-thru times with more of a focus on off-premise customers than having to cater to both in-sore and drive-thru orders.\n\nAfter launching CosMc\u2019s in December 2023, McDonald\u2019s opened one unit in Illinois and six in Texas. Other fast food chains have been trialing spin-off concepts as well, including Taco Bell\u2019s Live M\u00e1s Caf\u00e9, a beverage-centric concept inside an existing Taco Bell, and KFC\u2019s Saucy restaurant, which focuses on 11 different sauces.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, which said CosMc\u2019s has said is more of a learning lab, has also seen which flavors have been most popular. Its Island Pick Me Up Punch, Churro Cold Brew Frappe and the Sour Energy Burst are among the top sellers, while Fruity Popping Boba is the most popular drink to customize. Favorite food items have been Hashbrown Bites and McPops, with hundreds of thousands sold so far, per the company.\n\n\u201cWe have just scratched the surface about what we can learn about this growing category,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said. \u201cThe tests will continue for the foreseeable future as CosMc\u2019s continues to grow.\u201d\n\nNot all spin-offs have been successful. A handful of casual chains, including IHOP and Outback Steakhouse, have tried spin-offs in the past with smaller menus. IHOP closed its spinoff in 2023, while Outback parent Bloomin\u2019 Brands has been closing its Aussie Grill locations in the U.S.",

The company said it made the decision to close the locations after deciding that its smaller units better enable it to \u201ctest new, unique circumstances that are reflective of our customer base.\u201d\n\nStill, it represents a quick pullback for half of the CosMc\u2019s opened in Texas over the past year, and one-third of the locations initially planned for the market.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s debuted CosMc\u2019s in late 2023 with its first location in a remodeled Boston Market in Bolingbrook, Illinois. The concept initially drew long lines of curious customers, some from as far away as the U.K. or France.\n\nCosMc's generated long lines after it first opened in December 2023. | Photo courtesy of Linda Rasmussen.\n\nThe concept is designed to take advantage of consumers\u2019 apparent affinity for digital-focused, drive-thru beverage brands, one of the hottest growth sectors in the restaurant space right now thanks to brands such as Dutch Bros, Scooter\u2019s and 7 Brew.\n\nYet McDonald\u2019s has indicated from the get-go that this was a test-and-learn concept and many of its new locations were created with different formats to see what works. The company has provided relatively few details on the concept.\n\nThe company\u2019s pullback suggests its larger-format stores aren\u2019t quite generating the sales it hopes to get, at least to justify the locations\u2019 size. It also suggests that McDonald\u2019s is not afraid to quickly pull the plug on ideas that don\u2019t work.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s did provide other details about what products have sold the best. Some of CosMc\u2019s best-selling beverages include the energy drink Island Pick-Me-Up Punch and the Sour Energy Burst. The Churro Cold Brew Frappe also sells well. Its most popular customization is Fruity Popping Boba.\n\nCosMc\u2019s Savory Hashbrown Bites is the top-selling food item, though the company also said it has sold \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of its McPops.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s did note that it will continue to test the concept. \u201cWe have just scratched the surface about what we can learn about this growing category,\u201d the company said.\n\nMembers help make our journalism possible.

The order-ahead lane deploys technology McDonald\u2019s said allows employees to begin preparing customers\u2019 orders when they\u2019re near the restaurant. The location\u2019s app updates, food and beverage conveyor, and new kitchen format, all work to streamline operations, the brand said at the time.\n\nA year later, the first CosMc\u2019s opened.

A company representative described the design as a pilot that\u2019s \u201coptimized for drive-thru and digital ordering.\u201d\n\nThe designs show McDonald\u2019s belief in the future of digital. In Q3 2023, McDonald\u2019s digital business mixed more than 40 percent of sales across its top six markets, totaling nearly $9 billion. Helping accelerate off-premises growth is MyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards. CEO Chris Kempczinski said in July that McDonald\u2019s had 166 million loyalty members, which was ahead of expectations. Its goal is to reach 250 million members by 2027.\n\n",

            "content": "One reason is that there is generally nothing wrong with a little willful anachronism. I like that \u201cMoulin Rouge\u201d (both the film and the stage musical) uses modern club music despite taking place in the bohemian Montmartre of fin de si\u00e8cle Paris. This music is the only way to give us a sense of how the actual music of the period felt to people of that time. And I love the interracial casting in the production of \u201cOur Town\u201d soon to depart Broadway, because the setting of that play has always been meant as an abstraction rather than a specific place. It took me a while to get used to the television show \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d using the slang of our times, but I eventually realized that this was the only way to make the characters in this exquisite confection come across to us as genuinely funny human beings.\n\nBesides, musicals are inherently fantasies. \u201cGypsy\u201d takes place in a specific context \u2014 vaudeville dying between the world wars \u2014 but with few sociohistorical particulars. Asked in a radio interview about my criticism, McDonald pointedly replied that if playing Rose as Black strains credulity, \u201cHow do you square that people just burst into song?\u201d A good question.\n\nMy second reason for revising my opinion is trickier. McDonald happens to be able to play \u201cwhite\u201d \u2014 or maybe raceless \u2014 convincingly. She wasn\u2019t playing her role as unmistakably, culturally Black in \u201cCarousel\u201d in 1994, nor in a 2007 production of the musical \u201c110 in the Shade.\u201d Even in that recent radio interview, someone who had just tuned in might not have been able to tell the race of the person who was speaking. Or at least I couldn\u2019t.\n\nBut not everyone is as fluid as she is. Even some accomplished artists with effortless range may, in the shape of their vowels and their timbre, sound identifiably Black. These racial cues, which can also extend to aspects of body language, are subtle, but they mean that many actors, no matter their training or what roles they play, will always read onstage as not just visually but culturally Black. It\u2019s true for every ethnicity and race: All people can be deeply imprinted by the speech patterns we grow up around and the people we feel most comfortable with.\n\nIn this light, yes, Rose can become a Black character. So could Babe, the lead in \u201cThe Pajama Game.\u201d That is a 1950s musical about a strike at a factory in a working-class white town, but Blackness could lend the role interesting notes. Perhaps Babe could handle her love interest, the new superintendent, with a bit of \u201cR-E-S-P-E-C-T.\u201d In fact, a Black actress (Barbara McNair) did play this role in a Broadway revival in 1973 (against Hal Linden as the superintendent!), and the world didn\u2019t turn upside-down.",

His company, Jamren, owns and operates five McDonald\u2019s fast food restaurants, including the one at 300 Larry Holmes Drive in Easton.\n\nThe restaurant underwent extensive remodeling in 2017, but it needs another reboot, McIntyre said Wednesday.\n\nWork began the week of Sept. 18, 2017, on the McDonald's Restaurant in Downtown Easton.Tony Rhodin | lehighvalleylive.com file photo\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an older building from the 1980s,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to get better efficiencies with a new design.\u201d\n\nHis first step is getting an endorsement from the city historic district commission. He\u2019s on the agenda for Monday, but said a scheduling conflict will likely push that meeting back. He\u2019ll also need planning commission approval.\n\nHe hopes to start tearing down the building in 2026. McIntyre estimates construction will take about three to four months.\n\nHe recently completed an overhaul to his McDonald\u2019s in Coopersburg. The groundbreaking for that project was Nov. 26, 2021. The ribbon cutting was April 26, 2022. You can see photos of the new Coopersburg restaurant on the Jamren website. McIntyre said the Coopersburg restaurant is comparable to what he hopes to build in Easton.\n\nMcIntyre said the Easton kitchen layout will be more efficient. The restaurant will have modern mechanical systems and the latest generation of LED lights.\n\nJamren owns two McDonald\u2019s restaurants in Quakertown and single restaurants in Easton, Coopersburg and Hellertown.\n\nMost orders at the Easton location come in through the McDonald\u2019s app or are delivered directly to customers.

            "content": "A federal judge in Missoula on Wednesday heard arguments in a case that will determine whether a California couple who built a home on the banks of McDonald Creek in Glacier National Park did so illegally, and if a local conservation district has the authority to order the home\u2019s removal and the streambed\u2019s restoration.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case are John and Stacy Ambler, who sued the Flathead Conservation District (FCD) more than a year ago, seeking relief in U.S. District Court in Missoula, where U.S. Magistrate Judge Kathleen DeSoto concluded the Jan. 8 hearing pledging to \u201cendeavor to get an order as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe Amblers have asked DeSoto to weigh in on whether the FCD \u201chas jurisdiction and authority to order the Amblers to dismantle a house they are constructing on real property they own in Glacier National Park\u201d and restore portions of the stream bank they excavated. On Wednesday, attorneys for the plaintiffs and the defendants delivered oral arguments on cross motions for summary judgment.\n\nIn asserting its authority, attorneys for the FCD argued that the home\u2019s location within the park\u2019s boundaries does not preempt the enforcement of the state\u2019s foremost streambed protection law, the Montana Natural Streambed and Land Protection Act (NSLPA). In the absence of analogous federal law, FCD attorney Camisha Sawtelle said criteria surrounding the construction of a home on a private parcel girded by National Park Service land should default to the state law\u2019s regulatory arm.\n\nMeanwhile, the Amblers say only Glacier National Park can govern private inholdings, stating the FCD \u201ccannot unilaterally reassert jurisdiction over lands to which the State of Montana long ago ceded jurisdiction to the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only issue in this case is federal versus state jurisdiction over the Amblers\u2019 property,\u201d according to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, which asks the judge to rule in favor of the couple and resolve the jurisdictional question without going to trial.\n\nThe case began locally when residents in the West Glacier area complained about the construction project, clearly visible to park visitors and neighbors, which prompted FCD to conduct an onsite inspection. Following the inspection, FCD determined the Amblers had violated the NSLPA (better known as the 310 law) by building on an immediate bank of McDonald Creek and excavating the stream bank to create a pad for construction, all without obtaining the necessary 310 permit, the statute\u2019s key enforcement provision.\n\nThe FCD ruled that the Amblers must remove the home and remediate the streambed. However, the couple challenged the FCD\u2019s jurisdictional authority in the case and proceeded to what\u2019s called a declaratory ruling process, which was overseen by hearing officer Laurie Zeller, a retired bureau chief with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC).\n\nAfter reaffirming its jurisdictional authority, Zeller remanded the case back to the FCD, whose Board of Supervisors ruled that the couple must remove the home and repair the streambed no later than April 1, 2024.\n\nInstead, the Amblers filed lawsuits in state and federal courts, arguing that the FCD overstepped its authority by ordering the home\u2019s removal. As the legal saga drags on, the unfinished home remains visible to onlookers from the Camas Road.\n\nThe question at the center of this week\u2019s oral arguments was whether FCD has jurisdiction to enforce the 310 law, which states that any private individual or entity proposing work in or near a stream that \u201cphysically alters or modifies the bed or immediate banks of a perennial-flowing stream\u201d must first obtain an approved permit from the local conservation district.\n\nAccording to the Amblers, neither Flathead County nor Glacier National Park required any permits to begin construction on the property and connect the residence to the Apgar Village water and sewer system.\n\n\u201cGlacier National Park allowed the construction and allowed the Amblers to connect to the Apgar Village water and sewer system,\u201d the federal complaint from the plaintiffs states. \u201cThe Amblers dispute that the FCD has jurisdiction over the property and dispute that the NSLPA applies to the property.\u201d\n\nMembers of the FCD\u2019s Board of Supervisors attended Wednesday\u2019s court proceedings, as did a group of West Glacier and Apgar residents who joined the lawsuit as intervenors in the case, both to support the FCD\u2019s position as well as to represent themselves as stakeholders. The group, called Friends of Montana\u2019s Streams and Rivers (FMSR), has separate legal counsel than the FCD. Attorney Rob Farris-Olsen delivered arguments Wednesday on behalf of FMSR.\n\nMcDonald Creek as viewed from near Bird Woman Falls Overlook along Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park on April 24, 2023. Hunter D\u2019Antuono | Flathead Beacon\n\nBoth Sawtelle, representing FCD, and Farris-Olsen, for FMSR, argued that in the absence of a federal statute that specifically grants the National Park Service authority to regulate the construction of homes on private land within its boundaries, or that otherwise conflicts with or overwrites Montana\u2019s 310 law, the state statute is applicable.\n\n\u201cMy position is that the 310 law applies to Glacier National Park. That anyone doing work within the immediate banks of a perennial-flowing stream is required to get a 310 permit,\u201d Sawtelle said. \u201cThere is case law, your Honor, that tells us that, essentially, we don\u2019t want these properties unregulated. That these lands can\u2019t just operate in a void. So lacking any conflicting federal law, the state law can and should apply.\u201d\n\nThe case is unique given the project\u2019s location inside Glacier National Park, which when established in 1910 trapped private tracts of land staked by homesteaders prior to the park\u2019s existence. Originally totaling 13,000 acres, many of the homesteaders sold, or \u201cceded,\u201d their property to the National Park Service a century ago, but some remain. Known as \u201cinholding,\u201d the bill establishing Glacier Park was explicit in its concession that landowners would retain \u201cfull use and enjoyment of their properties\u201d and that \u201cnothing herein contained shall affect any valid existing claim, location or entry under the land rules of the United States, or the rights of any such claimant.\u201d\n\nIn other words, state law applies to the inholdings.\n\nBut DeSoto said her interpretation of underlying case law is that \u201cthe state laws that existed at the time of the cession are assimilated.\u201d Applying that logic, it\u2019s not extraordinary for the federal court to, for example, adjudicate water rights or easements inside the park\u2019s boundaries because there was a body of state law governing water rights and easements prior to the creation of Glacier National Park.\n\n\u201cBut the 310 law was a completely new statute that was created many decades after the creation of Glacier National Park,\u201d DeSoto said.\n\nAlthough Sawtelle said \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that [the park] hasn\u2019t incorporated the 310 law,\u201d or drafted one of its own, it\u2019s understandable that adopting a federal statute analogous to the NSLPA hasn\u2019t emerged as a top priority for park administrators, given that the purpose of Glacier National Park is to protect the 1-million-acre reserve of natural resources and wildlife within its boundaries, and not to facilitate the construction of new homes or summer cottages.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the purpose of Glacier National Park and the purpose of the 310 law, the intention of the underlying policy is to protect the resources,\u201d Sawtelle said. \u201cIt says let\u2019s not have people digging out a perennial stream in Glacier National Park. The private inholdings in Glacier National Park are subject to state law unless there\u2019s conflicting federal law.\u201d\n\nSawtelle said while it\u2019s clear the federal government has the authority to adopt its own version of the 310 statute, the local rules should apply to private inholdings in its absence.\n\n\u201cRather than accepting the result that this is a void, lacking any federal law, this state law must apply,\u201d Sawtelle said.\n\nThat\u2019s not how Trent Baker of Datsopoulos, MacDonald & Lind, a Missoula-based law firm representing the Amblers, sees it. To Baker\u2019s understanding of case law, there\u2019s no question as to whether the federal government accepted sovereignty and political dominion over the state land ceded to it more than a century ago at the time of Glacier Park\u2019s creation. The question is whether a political subsidiary of the state, such as FCD, can enforce the provisions of a state law that didn\u2019t exist when the land was ceded.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing like this law in place at the time of the cession in the early 1900s,\u201d Baker said. \u201cI mean, this law was enacted decades later. It was conceived as an enforcement tool for agricultural users engaging in irrigation diversion and agricultural activities that might affect the stream. Conservation districts would basically regulate the activities and grant permits to allow these activities to occur and to minimize impacts on streams as a result of those activities. But there was nothing like that on the books back [when the Amblers\u2019 land was ceded]. At least nothing that I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\n[email protected]",

The boy sustained severe injuries and was temporarily hospitalized.\n\nHirabaru denied allegations of murdering Nakashima but admitted to stabbing the boy, claiming he had no intention to kill, according to Fukuoka prefectural police.\n\nDespite it being unlikely that Hirabaru and the two students knew each other, the police said he targeted the pair for a specific reason, and the attacks were not random, adding that the victims are \"not at fault.\"\n\nThe police confiscated several dozen knives after searching Hirabaru's house and a vehicle and detected the blood of two people on one of them, which analysis showed was not inconsistent with those of Nakashima and the boy, they said.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nMan sent to prosecutors over fatal stabbing at Japan McDonald's\n\nMan arrested on suspicion of involvement in teen stabbing in Japan\n\nMcDonald's teen stabbing victims not specifically targeted: source",

            "content": "Another Christmas is in the books, and we are now dealing with the fact we have already burned through the first quarter of the 21st century. We get a respite from the interminable holiday film, music, and television juggernaut, and do not have to be concerned with the 178 different iterations of \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d for another 10 months. So, for now, we can go back to our regularly scheduled programming.\n\nYet, I remain slightly haunted by this past Christmas. Now, my personal prayer life is not what it should be, but at the same time, it is a lot better than it has ever been. Almost every night \u2014 I said it was better, not perfect \u2014 before I drift off to sleep I do a little spiritual inventory and run through a litany of special intentions. It may be for someone close to me who is struggling with a health issue, someone going through a long night of the soul, or just a general request upon the Virgin Mary to put a good word in for me and my loved ones as we, hopefully, strive to be better followers of her Son.\n\nBut the haunted part, which, in my best Edgar Allan Poe simulation, \u201cbinds me still,\u201d is an image I saw at an unlikely place for a haunting: a McDonald\u2019s outside the little Tennessee hamlet of Shiloh. My wife and I were visiting our sons, and our boys and I had convinced my wife that her travel bucket list could not be complete without a visit to a major Civil War battlefield.\n\nAfter we had our fill of history at the Shiloh National Military Park battlefield, it was time for the three-hour drive back to Nashville. An army travels on its stomach but apparently tourists do also, so we stopped for a snack.\n\nThe downtown of Shiloh can be missed if you blink, but someone saw a McDonald\u2019s and we stopped. We settled into a booth, my sons and I still on our natural high from walking the grounds of an American historical site. But as someone spoke about U.S. Grant\u2019s heroic stand and how the battle might have been different if Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston had not been killed, I saw something in the corner booth that brought me crashing back to the here and now.\n\nThere was a nest of blankets in the corner of the booth. On it rested a little boy of about 5. By the looks of one of the blankets, his favorite \u201csecurity blanky\u201d was part of the bedding. He had some kind of cheap tablet device from which he was watching a cartoon. And every now and then, one of the McDonald\u2019s workers, a young woman who looked still in her teens, checked on him.\n\nThe boy seemed to know the drill. His mom was working and there was no one to watch him, so he was going to spend God knows how many hours hunkered down in that booth. Like most children who live in want, he seemed to have become accustomed to his circumstances.\n\nI observed this modern Dickensian tableau long before the Christmas season even began, and my educated guess is that it will be played out long after the last pine needle from a long-forgotten Christmas tree is vacuumed up from a living room floor \u2014 sometime in mid-April, I would surmise.\n\nIt is easy to judge this scene by questioning this young mother\u2019s choices that put her in this economic bind. But we need to remember that she also chose life for this little boy tucked away in that booth.\n\nCharles Dickens was a great writer and his \u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d among many other great works, has rightfully stood the test of time. But his wheelhouse of observing and commenting on the British economic and class system has almost sanitized poverty. They made a musical out of \u201cOliver Twist,\u201d after all.\n\nNow maybe this little boy had a first-world problem of not having the state-of-the-art tablet that children with more affluent parents have, but at least to me, seeing this little guy so resigned, and resilient for that matter, in the face of his poverty continues to disquiet me.\n\nSo, if one of your New Year\u2019s resolutions is improving your prayer life and you are doing inventory as you lie in bed, say a prayer for that little boy in the booth at McDonald\u2019s in Shiloh, Tennessee \u2014 the Blessed Mother knows where it is. And say one for his mom as well.",

Additionally, the fast-food chain has reportedly brought back one of its most popular and beloved desserts: the Strawberry & Creme Pie. Let\u2019s look at the details.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s McValue Menu: All the Details\n\nAccording to CBS News, during the business\u2019s third-quarter results call last year, CEO Chris Kempczinski admitted that the \u201cvalue leadership gap has shrunk\u201d and that the company has been concentrating on enhancing its savings offerings.\n\nA range of meal discounts are offered under the new McValue menu, which is accessible at McDonald\u2019s restaurants around the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong these is the $5 Meal Deal that McDonald\u2019s introduced last June, which includes four Chicken McNuggets, a small order of fries, a small soft drink, and a McChicken sandwich or a McDouble burger.\n\nThe McValue menu also features a new \u201cBuy One, Add One for $1\u201d offer, which lets customers choose between eight different breakfast, lunch, and dinner items like burgers, nuggets, and breakfast sandwiches. They can add an extra item from the McValue menu for just $1 when they purchase one full-priced item.\n\nThe new McValue platform will also provide local food and drink specials and exclusive offers via its mobile app. For instance, every Friday this year, guests who spend $1 get a medium order of fries for free. The company also offers a complimentary McCrispy chicken sandwich to new app users.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to introduce the new platform, McDonald\u2019s has teamed up with actor and professional wrestler John Cena, describing him as \u201cthe perfect McValue ambassador.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always talk about \u2018earning my sunset\u2019 and there\u2019s nothing like heading to McDonald\u2019s after completely crushing your day,\u201d Cena said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ll admit \u2014 it\u2019s tough to choose between some of my favorites sometimes, but now I don\u2019t have to. The fact that fans can mix and match with the new McValue menu to get great deals on the food they love is going to be an absolute game-changer.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, according to the popular Instagram food blogger Snackolator, the company is bringing back its popular Strawberry & Creme Pie for dessert.\n\n\u201cThese are rolling out now to replace the Holiday Pies and have popped up in a bunch of markets already and are one of the limited time favorites,\u201d the food blogger wrote, adding that they\u2019ve been added to the menu ahead of Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nDEI Initiatives Being Discontinued\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, despite these new menu additions, McDonald\u2019s stated Monday, Jan. 6, that it will no longer meet specific goals for achieving diversity in senior leadership. It also intends to end a program that rewards its suppliers for developing diversity training and increasing the percentage of minority group members in leadership roles.\n\nThe fast-food restaurant giant partially blamed its decision on a U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed discriminatory action in college admissions.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s also declared that it will stop conducting \u201cexternal surveys.\u201d The massive burger chain did not elaborate. However, several other companies, including Ford and Lowe\u2019s, ceased participating in the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s yearly poll measuring workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.\n\nThe Chicago-based fast-food giant launched a series of diversity initiatives in 2021 following a wave of sexual harassment complaints involving its employees and a discrimination lawsuit brought by former Black McDonald\u2019s franchise owners.\n\nNow, McDonald\u2019s is the most recent major company to alter its tactics after the 2023 ruling and conservative pushback against diversity, equity, and inclusion measures. Many businesses, including Walmart, John Deere, and Harley-Davidson, withdrew their DEI initiatives last year.",

Puskar/AP\n\nMcDonald's says it is changing some of its inclusion standards, becoming the latest large company to announce it is rolling back some of its diversity practices.\n\nIn its statement, the company said it will no longer set \"aspirational representation goals\" and instead \"focus on continuing to embed inclusion practices\" that grow its business. Additionally, it is temporarily suspending external surveys to shift its focus internally, the company said.\n\nIt is also changing the name of its diversity team to the Global Inclusion Team, and \"retiring Supply Chain's Mutual Commitment to DEI pledge in favor of a more integrated discussion with suppliers about inclusion as it relates to business performance.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn making the announcement on Monday, the U.S. multinational restaurant chain became the latest to shift its practices on diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. Last November, Walmart said it would roll back some of its DEI policies.\n\nMcDonald's says it has recently made several strides toward being more inclusive, including having more than 30% of its U.S. leadership executives coming from underrepresented backgrounds.\n\nIt also says it had the highest number of new diverse franchisee applicants in its history.\n\n\"Everyone is welcome under our Golden Arches, and this broad-based appeal is why McDonald's is one of the world's most beloved brands,\" the company said. \"We're proud of our culture at McDonald's, and we want to thank all of you for living our values.\"\n\n",

            "content": "Four years after launching a push for more diversity in its ranks, McDonald\u2019s is ending some of its diversity practices, citing a US supreme court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is the latest big company to shift its tactics in the wake of the 2023 ruling and a conservative backlash against diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Walmart, John Deere, Harley-Davidson and others rolled back their DEI initiatives last year.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said Monday it will retire specific goals for achieving diversity at senior leadership levels. It also intends to end a program that encourages its suppliers to develop diversity training and to increase the number of minority group members represented within their own leadership ranks.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said it will also pause \u201cexternal surveys\u201d. The burger giant did not elaborate, but several other companies, including Lowe\u2019s and Ford, suspended their participation in an annual survey by the Human Rights Campaign that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, which has its headquarters in Chicago, rolled out a series of diversity initiatives in 2021 after a spate of sexual harassment lawsuits filed by employees and a lawsuit alleging discrimination brought by a group of Black former McDonald\u2019s franchise owners.\n\n\u201cAs a world-leading brand that considers inclusion one of our core values, we will accept nothing less than real, measurable progress in our efforts to lead with empathy, treat people with dignity and respect, and seek out diverse points of view to drive better decision-making,\u201d McDonald\u2019s chairman and chief executive Chris Kempczinski wrote in a LinkedIn post at the time.\n\n\u201cWe also have to acknowledge that some people in our system feel like they haven\u2019t been given a fair opportunity. We\u2019ve got to face up to that fact and do better,\u201d Kempczinski said in July 2020 when the diversity initiatives were first announced.\n\nThe company had vowed at that time to reduce barriers so its leadership would be more diverse and better resemble the communities it serves.\n\nHowever McDonald\u2019s said Monday that the \u201cshifting legal landscape\u201d after the supreme court decision and the actions of other corporations caused it to take a hard look at its own policies.\n\nA shifting political landscape may also have played a role. Donald Trump is a vocal opponent of diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Trump tapped Stephen Miller, a former adviser who leads a group called America First Legal that has aggressively challenged corporate DEI policies, as his incoming deputy chief of policy.\n\nVice-president-elect JD Vance introduced a bill in the Senate last summer to end such programs in the federal government.\n\nRobby Starbuck, a conservative political commentator who has threatened consumer boycotts of prominent consumer brands that do not retreat from their diversity programs, said Monday on X that he recently told McDonald\u2019s he would be doing a story on its \u201cwoke policies\u201d.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said it had been considering updates to its policies for several months and planned to time the announcement to the start of this year.\n\nIn an open letter to employees and franchisees, McDonald\u2019s senior leadership team said it remains committed to inclusion and believes a diverse workforce is a competitive advantage. The company said 30% of its US leaders are members of underrepresented groups, up from 29% in 2021. McDonald\u2019s previously committed to reaching 35% by the end of this year.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said it has achieved one of the goals it announced in 2021: gender pay equity at all levels of the company. It also said it expected to achieve a goal of having 25% of total supplier spending go to diverse-owned businesses by the end of the year.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said it would continue to support efforts that ensure a diverse base of employees, suppliers and franchisees, but its diversity team will now be referred to as the global inclusion team. The company said it would also continue to report its demographic information.\n\nThe McDonald\u2019s Hispanic Owner-Operators Association said it had no comment on the policy change Monday. A message seeking comment was left with the National Black McDonald\u2019s Operators Association.",

The ad closes on the wrestler making his signature \u201cyou can\u2019t see me\u201d hand gesture before disappearing.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is ramping up its value offerings after consumer price sensitivity weighed on the business last year. The Golden Arches owner is extending its popular $5 Meal Deal and bowing a Buy One, Add One for $1 offer, along with running a range of local franchisee and in-app promotions.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is ringing in the new year with a more expansive value platform \u2014 and a pep talk from John Cena. A wider assortment of meal deals, including a Buy One, Add One for $1 offer, follows a period where the fast food chain grappled with price-sensitive consumers and its first decline in U.S. comp sales since the start of the pandemic. Promotions like the $5 Meal Deal helped the brand regain some momentum in the second half of 2024, a strategy it\u2019s now trying to better capitalize on with the aid of celebrity-led marketing. The McValue platform was first unveiled in November.\n\nIn the new ads, Cena explains how the Buy One, Add One for $1 promotion works while outfitted in a mustard yellow zip-up sweater and matching tie. The vibe of the video shifts as Cena stands up and begins espousing the larger transformational power of McValue, stating that, at any moment, the platform \u201ccould take you to a place where a whole new menu of possibilities exist, inspiring you to order more from life than you could ever imagine.\u201d Cena then waves his hand over his face, a signature move from his wrestling career, before disappearing into the horizon. Cena\u2019s \u201cyou can\u2019t see me\u201d gesture and supposed invisibility have become a recognizable meme in larger internet culture beyond wrestling fandom.\n\nThe timing of the campaign could resonate for a few reasons: Many people are trying to commit to New Year\u2019s resolutions and could appreciate the humorous angle. Cena, an iconic wrestling personality who has broken into Hollywood stardom, this week also kicked off his farewell tour with the WWE.\n\nAlong with the 30-second TV spot and an extended cut on YouTube with additional pops of surreality, Cena appears in additional content on McDonald\u2019s social channels. Wieden + Kennedy is McDonald\u2019s creative agency.\n\nMcValue will also see McDonald\u2019s partner with over a dozen brands, including YouTube, Tinder, Roku, American Airlines and Lyft, to share more than $3 million in promotional offers throughout January. McDonald\u2019s latest in-app perks include free medium fries with a $1 purchase every Friday this year and a free McCrispy chicken sandwich for new users, which might help drive sign-ups.\n\nThe McValue marketing blitz lands the same week as an announcement that McDonald\u2019s will roll back key diversity initiatives, part of a larger pullback on DEI programs among large brand marketers.",

The popular $5 meal deal unveiled earlier this year is the main draw, and the McValue menu will also feature a new \u201cBuy One, Add One for $1\u201d option that includes breakfast.\n\nThe new McValue menu will also include more app-exclusive offers, plus local food and drink deals organized by its franchisees. McDonald\u2019s has also enlisted John Cena, the WWE wrestler-turned-actor and a \u201clifelong fan\u201d of the chain, for a new marketing campaign promoting the menu, the company said in a press release Tuesday.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is trying to reignite growth after several dismal quarters. The value perception of the chain has dimmed among its cash-conscious customers: The average price of items has soared about 40% since 2019. The company says this is in line with its rising costs.\n\nThe chain announced the new menu in November, shortly after an E. coli outbreak that caused sales and traffic to nosedive. McDonald\u2019s said it would pump $100 million into marketing and aid for franchises most heavily affected by the health scare, which has since ended.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is giving away $3 million in promotional offers from 16 other brands to spread the word, including a free month of YouTube TV or a free subscription to a paid Tinder tier. Users have to \u201cinteract with McValue ads\u201d when they see them on the apps or websites to unlock the deals.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) will release quarterly earnings on February 3, giving investors a first peek at whether these efforts are working.\n\nA McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Omaha, Nebraska. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nFocusing on value\n\nMany consumers are feeling cash-strapped, with prices rising for everything from groceries to housing\u2014and fast food. The national rollout of McValue helps \u201cenhance the broader image of McDonald\u2019s as a value-oriented brand,\u201d according to David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm.\n\n\u201cRestaurant traffic remains challenged, and this really represents a line of thinking that value will continue to be important to the consumer for the foreseeable future,\u201d he previously told CNN. \u201cInflation remains elevated, and creating a more structured, long-term value platform tells me that McDonald\u2019s really sees opportunity in doubling down in its focus on budget-oriented consumers.\u201d\n\nThe new menu category is McDonald\u2019s largest value-minded effort since 2018, when it priced some items between $1 to $3.\n\nBut the dollar menu proved relatively unpopular compared to the far more successful $5 value meal, which rolled out last summer. Customers weren\u2019t necessarily shopping for inexpensive food as much as more bang for their buck.\n\nUltimately, inflation had all but wiped out the items found at the lower end of that pricing tier. The McValue menu will replace what\u2019s left of it.",

And it will stop participating in external surveys that measure corporate diversity.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is also changing the name of its diversity team to the Global Inclusion Team \u2014 a common practice for many other companies that have rolled back diversity pledges.\n\n\u201cThis name change is more fitting for McDonald\u2019s in light of our inclusion value and better aligns with this team\u2019s work,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in the statement.\n\nBut the company said it has not abandoned its mission to maintain a diverse workforce. Instead, McDonald said that it will continue to support practices that foster inclusion in the workplace and across its operations, and it will work with its suppliers and vendors to discuss diversity and inclusion practices.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s position and our commitment to inclusion is steadfast,\u201d the company said in its statement. \u201cSince our founding, we\u2019ve prided ourselves on understanding that the foundation of our business is people. As Fred Turner said, \u2018We\u2019re a people business, and never forget it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe company said its new position was driven by a recent Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action and other corporations reevaluating their diversity initiatives. Online pressure, legal threats and customer opposition have led many companies, including Walmart, Ford, Harley-Davidson, John Deere and others to make changes to their DEI initiatives.\n\nA new era of DEI practices\n\nBut some observers say that many high-profile corporate moves on DEI aren\u2019t as large a change as they might seem.\n\n\u201cDEI isn\u2019t going away. It\u2019s just changing,\u201d J. Danielle Carr, chief officer of inclusion at Lowenstein Sandler and president of the Association of Law Firm Diversity Professionals, told CNN in December. The organization found that just 14 of the Fortune 500 companies made any public changes to their DEI teams or programs in 2024.\n\nDEI commitments can include anything from employee training, resource networks and recruiting practices to advance representation of people with various identities and backgrounds.\n\nThe fast food chain said it saw growth in leadership, supplier and franchisee diversity in 2024 due to its previous commitments. McDonald\u2019s said 30% of its leaders in the United States were from underrepresented groups and 78% of employees \u201cscored McDonald\u2019s positively\u201d in the company\u2019s employee pulse survey. The company also said it met its goal to allocate 25% of supply-chain spending to diverse-owned suppliers by the end of 2025.\n\n\u201cWe are immensely proud of these accomplishments, but we are not satisfied,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in its statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Costco recently acknowledged that the benefits of its DEI policies proved too rewarding to back down, despite backlash from activist shareholders aiming to end the company\u2019s ambitions.\n\nThe warehouse club retailer said its supplier program has focused on expanding with small and diverse businesses and the efforts have helped attract and retain diverse employees.\n\n\u201cAmong other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the \u2018treasure hunt\u2019 that our customers value,\u201d Costco said in its proxy statement to investors.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said it will not cut franchisee affinity groups and business networks, which \u201cpromote entrepreneurship and foster supportive connections.\u201d It will continue reporting company demographics each year, McDonald\u2019s said in the statement, and remain committed to pay equity.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s also said it would evaluate its work based on four beliefs: that it \u201cthrives\u201d when \u201cshaped by the communities in which we operate;\u201d that inclusivity gives it an advantage; that its priority is acting responsibly; and that individuals \u201cperform their best when they belong.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional content",

Walmart, John Deere, Harley-Davidson and others rolled back their DEI initiatives last year.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said Monday it will retire specific goals for achieving diversity at senior leadership levels. It also intends to end a program that encourages its suppliers to develop diversity training and to increase the number of minority group members represented within their own leadership ranks.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said it will also pause \u201cexternal surveys.\u201d The burger giant didn\u2019t elaborate, but several other companies, including Lowe\u2019s and Ford Motor Co., suspended their participation in an annual survey by the Human Rights Campaign that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, which has its headquarters in Chicago, rolled out a series of diversity initiatives in 2021 after a spate of sexual harassment lawsuits filed by employees and a lawsuit alleging discrimination brought by a group of Black former McDonald\u2019s franchise owners.\n\n\u201cAs a world-leading brand that considers inclusion one of our core values, we will accept nothing less than real, measurable progress in our efforts to lead with empathy, treat people with dignity and respect, and seek out diverse points of view to drive better decision-making,\u201d McDonald\u2019s Chairman and CEO Chris Kempczinski wrote in a LinkedIn post at the time.\n\nBut McDonald\u2019s said Monday that the \u201cshifting legal landscape\u201d after the Supreme Court decision and the actions of other corporations caused it to take a hard look at its own policies.\n\nA shifting political landscape may also have played a role. President-elect Donald Trump is a vocal opponent of diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Trump tapped Stephen Miller, a former adviser who leads a group called America First Legal that has aggressively challenged corporate DEI policies,as his incoming deputy chief of policy.\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance introduced a bill in the Senate last summer to end such programs in the federal government.\n\nRobby Starbuck, a conservative political commentator who has threatened consumer boycotts of prominent consumer brands that don\u2019t retreat from their diversity programs, said Monday on X that he recently told McDonald\u2019s he would be doing a story on its \u201cwoke policies.\u201d\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said it had been considering updates to its policies for several months and planned to time the announcement to the start of this year.\n\nIn an open letter to employees and franchisees, McDonald\u2019s senior leadership team said it remains committed to inclusion and believes a diverse workforce is a competitive advantage. The company said 30% of its U.S. leaders are members of underrepresented groups, up from 29% in 2021. McDonald\u2019s previously committed to reaching 35% by the end of this year.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said it has achieved one of the goals it announced in 2021: gender pay equity at all levels of the company. It also said it met three years early a goal of having 25% of total supplier spending go to diverse-owned businesses.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said it would continue to support efforts that ensure a diverse base of employees, suppliers and franchisees, but its diversity team will now be referred to as the Global Inclusion Team. The company said it would also continue to report its demographic information.\n\nThe McDonald\u2019s Hispanic Owner-Operators Association said it had no comment on the policy change Monday. A message seeking comment was left with the National Black McDonald\u2019s Operators Association.",

He previously pressured a range of companies from Walmart to Ford Motor Co. to make changes and said he contacted McDonald's on Friday urging it to do the same.\n\nDEI 50 years later Why we are still fighting over this affirmative action case\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, which said the changes had been under consideration for months, joins a growing list of major companies to backtrack on DEI commitments made after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 forced a historic reckoning with race in America.\n\nDEI critics allege that women and people of color are being handed jobs and promotions at the expense of more qualified and deserving candidates.\n\nOn the campaign trail, President-elect Donald Trump, a vocal DEI critic, promoted the idea that white Americans were targets of racism and made reversing Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cwoke takeover\u201d of Washington a priority of his second term in office.\n\nProponents say DEI programs are critical to level the playing field for people of color and women. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon and other business leaders have repeatedly stressed that diversity is good for business.\n\nEmployees of color are underrepresented at every level of power in corporate America, according to USA TODAY data investigations. One analysis in 2023 found that white men account for 7 in 10 executive officers in the nation\u2019s largest companies. About 1 in 7 of these companies had executive teams made up only of white men.\n\nIn 2020, McDonald\u2019s established \u201caspirational goals\u201d to increase representation of women and underrepresented groups at senior leadership levels, both in its corporate workforce and at company-operated restaurants. A year later, it vowed to recruit more franchisees from diverse backgrounds.\n\nLast year\u2019s independent audit of the company\u2019s civil rights policies found that the company made \u201cadmirable progress\u201d in increasing representation of women and underrepresented groups in its corporate workforce but diversity in its company-operated restaurants was \u201cless developed.\u201d",

After another strong year for US equities, consensus expectations point to further gains in 2025, driven by the incoming Trump administration\u2019s pro-business agenda. However, warning signs are flashing. Rising yields are increasing pressure on the bond market.\n\nLarry McDonald, founder of \u00abThe Bear Traps Report\u00bb and author of \u00abHow to Listen When Markets Speak,\u00bb warns that stress in the financial system is building rapidly. He anticipates a potential credit market shock as early as in the coming months, which could spell serious trouble for banks.\n\n\u00abThe inflation problem hasn\u2019t been fixed,\u00bb says the former Lehman trader about the current environment. \u00abThrowing Trump-inspired animal spirits on top of the current level of inflation, coming off the largest surge in thirty years, is like putting lighter fluid on the fire,\u00bb he adds.\n\nIn an in-depth interview with The Market NZZ, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity, McDonald outlines key developments investors should monitor and identifies compelling investment opportunities that go beyond the consensus thinking on Wall Street.\n\n\u00abIf inflation normalizes at a level of around 3.5%, investors will want to own companies that have hard assets in the ground\u00bb: Larry McDonald.\n\nWhat are the key factors and trends you\u2019re expecting to impact global markets in 2025?\n\nThe current situation is nearly identical to the turn of 2021/22. Back then, expectations for economic growth and corporate earnings had been surging all year; bears were on the run and the bulls were fully invested, and fiscal spending was in overdose territory. The entire street \u2013 as well as the Federal Reserve \u2013 were deeply bought into a disinflationary belief system.\n\nAnd today?\n\nToday, the picture is even more insane. The inflation problem hasn\u2019t been fixed. In the US, core PCE is nowhere near pre-COVID levels, and if growth picks up, inflation will quickly reverse higher. We\u2019re at a critical moment. The outgoing administration has opened the spigots to the max, and the economy is gaining momentum. In other words, the Fed has been cutting interest rates into a re-accelerating economy, and everything the incoming Trump administration wants to do is inflationary, at least in the short term.\n\nIn 2022, the return of inflation triggered a quake in the bond market, also severely impacting stocks. In the past months, bond yields have been rising again. How do you interpret this development?\n\nMarkets are in a very precarious situation because the Biden team did a very clever, but also very dangerous thing. Normally, the US Treasury Department tries to issue a balanced portfolio of debt securities. But in 2024, as we recently pointed out in our blog, they issued a colossal load of extremely short-term bills. In total, the Treasury faced around $10 trillion of maturing debt last year. To refinance this debt, it issued a whopping $26 trillion of bills and bonds. More than 84% of that paper was short-term bills with a maturity of six months or less. Thereby, they succeeded in suppressing bond volatility in an election year and \u2013 in our view \u2013 strategically placing that bond market volatility into 2025, after the election.\n\nWhat are the implications of this?\n\nIn essence, they prevented the economy from going into recession. However, both Democrats and Republicans do these kinds of things. In 2008, for example, when George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts inflated the budget deficit, Republicans took a similar approach, trying to create a good setup for John McCain\u2019s presidential candidacy. But this time, we\u2019re talking nearly $2 trillion of fiscal spending. And keep in mind, 25% of US total debt issuance comes due this year. So now, there\u2019s a big bill to pay.\n\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nIt means the incoming Trump administration has to take some painful measures early. Basically, they want to take the negative effects of their policy changes as far away from the midterms as possible. This applies to actions such as tariffs as well as terming out the debt. The new Treasury Department under Scott Bessent has to start issuing longer-dated paper, a lot more 5-, 10-, and 30-year bonds. Those types of securities move violently, and there\u2019s just not as many foreign buyers as there used to be.\n\nSo what\u2019s expecting investors in 2025?\n\nI\u2019m concerned we\u2019ll see an interest rate shock as early as the first quarter, possibly amplified by the inflationary threat of tariffs. And let\u2019s not forget: In 2017, the last time President Trump came into office, the markets were coming off the Brexit shock, and the strong US dollar had delivered significant manufacturing job losses in the Midwest; Core CPI was at 2.1% vs. 3.3% today. Throwing Trump-inspired animal spirits on top of the current level of inflation, coming off the largest surge in thirty years, is like putting lighter fluid on the fire.\n\nTen-year US Treasury Notes already trade at a yield of 4.6%, the highest level since last May. At what point are markets going to get anxious?\n\nIf the yield on ten-year Treasuries goes up another twenty or thirty basis points, it\u2019s going to be very problematic. It will break the banks again. In fact, their stocks are already starting to roll over. We\u2019ve seen this movie before: From its all-time high in early 2022, Bank of America\u2019s share price plummeted nearly 50%. Just look at Warren Buffett, he very rarely, if ever, sold a stock as fast as he\u2019s been selling Bank of America.\n\nWhy are rising interest rates so problematic for banks?\n\nBecause they cause stress in the financial system. A lot of thing will break, including assets related to commercial real estate and car loans. In a world where interest rates stay higher for longer, high-yield bonds are also dangerously exposed. The average-weight coupon on a lot of these bonds is around 4%, and that\u2019s going to go up to 6-8%. So despite inflation normalizing at a higher trajectory, key segments of the credit markets are still pricing in an environment with a lot of rate cuts by the Fed. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re going to have a full-blown financial crisis, but likely some sort of Liz Truss moment like in the fall of 2022 in Britain when the Gilts market revolted and the pound dropped to an all-time low. And then, Trump is going to blame the whole thing on Biden.\n\nHow will equity markets react to this?\n\nI think it\u2019s going to look a lot like in the early 1980s. When Ronald Reagan took office, inflation was not under control, but the stock market rallied sharply in the run-up of the election. Reagan was seen as the ultimate free markets candidate, and the beast in the market drove the S&P 500 up around 40% in the year leading up to the election; similar to the gains we\u2019ve seen in this election cycle since October 2023. However, at that point, there was a lot of goodwill priced in and sentiment turned as Reagan\u2019s team needed to take the pain early because they wanted a better set-up for the midterms. As a result, after reaching an all-time high towards November 1980, the S&P 500 didn\u2019t return to that level until two years later.\n\nSo, despite all the bullish forecasts for US stocks, are you advising caution?\n\nYes, historically, investors have not made money buying the stock market at 22 times forward earnings. In fact, with this much bullish sentiment, no one\u2019s really ever made any money. It\u2019s just a very bad time to buy equities. Furthermore, you can almost get equity-like returns with a portfolio across different parts of the bond market.\n\nThen again, are there also opportunities for investors in this environment?\n\nThe big trade on the long side is natural gas, specifically in natural gas equities. Looking at the stats around data centers, there\u2019s a huge power shortfall. We think we\u2019re close to somewhere between 40-45 gigawatts short over the next four years, setting up the threat of a real crisis. We\u2019re also going to need a whole power grid rebuild, and that\u2019s where copper comes into play. It\u2019s true madness: Everybody is chasing Nvidia and all these other AI names, but there\u2019s so much money to be made on the AI infrastructure side; including in nuclear energy with stocks like Cameco or the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF.\n\nWhat, in particular, plays in favor of natural gas companies?\n\nI believe Trump will forge a deal for US gas supplies with Europe, which would be extremely positive for the industry. Remember, in 2022, after the invasion of Ukraine, gas supplies from Russia were supposed to be replaced by LNG imports from the US. However, this is only partially the case so far. So I think Trump will try to push gas exports, for which the US now has considerably more capacity thanks to the significant buildout of LNG terminals.\n\nWhich names in that space promise the most potential?\n\nI like the First Trust Natural Gas ETF which contains a broad selection of mid-sized and large companies. There\u2019s a good chance that it will double in a couple of years. In terms of individual stocks, we particularly like Antero Resources. The company should generate around $1 billion in free cash flow next year and it trades at a market cap of just around $10 billion. So basically, it\u2019s valued at a free cash flow yield of 10%. In addition, Antero has reduced its debt by almost $1.5 billion since 2020.\n\nWhat do you think of energy stocks in general? Trump is friendly to the industry and wants to ramp up domestic oil production. However, rising supply could also put pressure on prices.\n\nHere\u2019s something not many people are talking about: The Biden team basically ran on killing shale in 2020. But then, when we had the energy shock two years later, they aggressively accelerated permitting for new oil and gas drilling. Now, a lot of that low hanging fruit has been taken. Although there is still plenty of room to growth, it will therefore make it hard for Trump to ramp up production soon. In terms of oil and gas drills, the rig count is down at around 590 today, roughly the same number when Trump came into office in early 2017. At the peak in 2018, the figure was more than 1,000, making oil service companies such as Schlumberger and Weatherford a screaming buy at today\u2019s discounted levels.\n\nIn other words, new wells are more complicated to drill, while production volumes and supply-side pressure on crude prices remain limited for the time being?\n\nYes, it\u2019s going to take Trump a little bit of time to be that effective. In the meantime, we have to fill up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. So although the incoming administration will try to push oil prices down in the run-up to the midterm elections, the setup for energy stocks is very bullish this year. Geopolitical factors also play an important role. When Trump returns to office, he will take a tough stance on Iran, and Israel is keen to target Iran\u2019s oil infrastructure, presumably the facilities on the island of Kharg in the Persian Gulf. The likelihood of a military strike or new sanctions against Tehran is high, which could have significant implications for the region and global oil markets.\n\nWhich energy stocks are particularly attractive?\n\nWe love Chevron, but broadly speaking, most energy stocks are dirt cheap and technically oversold, including names like Occidental Petroleum and ExxonMobil. A major reason for the recent sell-off had to do with tax-loss harvesting, which has had an unusually pronounced effect this time around.\n\nYou are referring to the strategy of timely selling securities at a loss to offset the amount of capital gains tax owed from selling profitable assets.\n\nYes, and this effect is especially amplified in years with substantial market gains, as accountants struggle to seek out losses to offset them. However, there\u2019s typically a counter-effect in January, where the previous year\u2019s winners get sold off. For example, stocks like Walmart, Nvidia, and United Airlines become attractive shorts as investors lock in profits. Conversely, beaten-down stocks like Occidental Petroleum, Intel, Estee Lauder, and Nike are poised for a rebound. The same goes for other tax-loss-harvesting victims such as Trulieve and other cannabis stocks or Brazilian companies like Vale and Banco Bradesco.\n\nHowever, the political situation in Brazil is rather unpredictable, which is unsettling for many investors.\n\nSure, the political uncertainty in Brazil has triggered a massive sell-off, and betting on the broad market is a little bit more complex right now. However, such sell-offs due to political uncertainty often offer great opportunities. Hard asset companies in Brazil like Vale are extremely cheap relative to what\u2019s coming at us. Vale is poised to become a real cash machine this year, with expected free cash flow of approximately $4.5 billion. Given its market capitalization of under $40 billion, this translates to a free cash flow yield of over 10%.\n\nSo your thesis that we\u2019re at the beginning of a new commodity super-cycle is still valid?\n\nAbsolutely, this decade will be defined by hard asset companies. The complacency around inflation is still off the charts. But the awareness is changing, and once the market fully acknowledges that we\u2019re in this whole new inflation regime with sustainably higher interest rates, we\u2019ll witness a seismic shift. Trillions of investment money will flow into the commodities sector. So when we have that bank stress moment and the Fed has to ease, that\u2019s when the big run on commodities will really begin.\n\nThen again, when the Fed has to ease monetary policy, it\u2019s usually due to concerns about the economy, which is not exactly favorable for investments in the commodities sector.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget: These stocks have already crashed. So when the Fed has to pump liquidity into the system to calm the situation, the dollar will roll over, boosting commodity prices. Therefore, once again: If inflation normalizes at a level of around 3.5%, investors will want to own companies that have hard assets in the ground. In five years, companies such as BHP, Vale and Chevron will be among the top 10 in the major indices.\n\nDo you think that\u2019s also applying to precious metals?\n\nOf course, we\u2019re big fans of the miners; particularly Barrick Gold, given its significant copper exposure \u2013 it\u2019s essentially a copper-gold play now. Net-net, gold miners are undervalued relative to gold, while the silver, platinum, and palladium names offer even more compelling value at this point. These stocks are also poised to benefit from the green hydrogen trade, providing an added catalyst for growth. Remember, all the gold ever produced would fill three Olympic sized swimming pools, but all the platinum ever mined would only cover your ankles in such a pool.\n\nAnother key factor for investments in the commodities space is China. What\u2019s your outlook on the Chinese economy, given its current challenges?\n\nObviously, China has a big deflationary problem, as evidenced by the sharp decline in 10-year bond yields to historic lows. So China has no choice, they have to implement fiscal stimulus, pulling both fiscal and monetary levers to revitalize their economy, creating a terrific opportunity for contrarian bets. Right now, global exposure is so bad in Chinese equities, everybody is under-owned. Against this backdrop, deeply undervalued stocks like Alibaba or the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF present a compelling buying opportunity. They\u2019ve also been heavily sold off for tax-loss harvesting purposes, so it won\u2019t take much for a significant rally.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the underperformance of Chinese stocks is the looming concern over trade tensions with the US. How are you dealing with this risk?\n\nThe threat of a trade war has been out there for months. Everybody knows that Trump is going to be hostile to China. As a result, a substantial amount of pessimism is already reflected in current valuations. What\u2019s more, history suggests that trade conflicts often create attractive entry points. For instance, if you bought Mexican stocks during the 2017 trade fears, you earned a return of 40% on your money in just a few months. So you get this big sell-off into a trade war, and that\u2019s usually a screaming buy.",

Unfortunately for shareholders, while the McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) share price is up 42% in the last five years, that's less than the market return.

There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nOver half a decade, McDonald's managed to grow its earnings per share at 8.4% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 7% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNYSE:MCD Earnings Per Share Growth January 4th 2025\n\nBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of McDonald's, it has a TSR of 60% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nMcDonald's shareholders are up 4.5% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 10% over five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for McDonald's you should know about.",

The picture is an illustration of Ronald McDonald on a stretcher being treated by paramedics.\n\nThe caption on the video, which has 4.1 million views reads: \"I\u2019m sure you can\u2019t find the 4th object.\" The four objects in question are a comb, a straw, a knife and some french fries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, spoiler, just like the previous puzzle there are only three objects in this picture for you to find. The french fries aren't in there at all so we're sorry to report but this is nothing but an elaborate social media prank.\n\nIn fact, there are now several of these on @e.ugh profile and they all play the same prank but it hasn't stopped people from falling for them.\n\nRemarkable in the Ronald McDonald one, people are finding other objects such as birds and dynamite. One person wrote: \"yeah i could not find the French fries but I found a Bird and dynamite...\"\n\nAnother added: \"Bro I saw a bird and dynamite.\"\n\nA third said: \"How are yous finding birds and dynamite I cant even find the mf fries.\"\n\nThis article was originally published on 30 April 2023\n\nHave your say in our news democracy.

            "content": "It was not at all surprising that Rishabh Pant bulldozed the Australian attack with his stroke-play in the second innings but his ultra-defensive approach on the opening day indeed was, Australia head coach Andrew McDonald said on Saturday. Pant had laboured to 40 off 98 balls, taking multiple blows on his body during his 149-minute stay on the wicket. Pant had said that he was not in a frame of mind to attack. Pant, though, changed the gears effortlessly in the second innings, hitting Mitchell Starc for two massive sixes. Scott Boland and Beau Webster were not spared either as they too were lofted for a six each.\n\n\"First of all, it's not surprising, the way he plays. We were in fact a little bit surprised in the first innings, the way he went about his work. He's got an incredible ability to put pressure back on to bowlers,\" McDonald said, doffing his hat to India's biggest match-winner in Test cricket in recent years.\n\nHowever, Australia didn't allow Pant to completely walk away as Pat Cummins dismissed him just when things looked like getting out of hand.\n\n\"We're planning for that though, we'll plan leading into the summer. We bounced in and out of a few plans there and clearly kept taking on the boundary riders and was getting away with it and no, it was an innings that you would say was right for that time.\"\n\nBoland has been difficult match-up for Kohli\n\nVirat Kohli has been out eight times in his nine innings while fishing at deliveries on or outside the off-stump and Australia head coach praised his bowlers, especially Scott Boland, who sent back the India stalwart four times in five Tests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes it seem easy to get Kohli out? \"No, it's never easy to get Virat out,\" McDonald, trying to contain his smile of satisfaction.\n\n\"I give full credit to the bowlers and the execution of the plan. It's one thing to have a plan, but then to be able to execute is another thing. It's put him (Kohli) under immense pressure. And, look, he's tried some things.\" \"He's tried walking out of his crease. He's tried different tactics as well. But clearly that relentless nature of our bowlers, in particular, Scottie (Boland), the 'match-up' has been incredibly difficult for him to combat. But he's never an easy wicket, no.\"\n\nThis is a pitch for even contests\n\nThe traditional SCG wicket is usually a batting paradise and also helps the spinners towards the end but the ongoing Test has unfolded on a green top with variable bounce on offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcDonald did not hide his appreciation for the ground staff for preparing a fair track.\n\n\"The ground staff have done an incredible job in terms of, creating a wicket with something in it. Traditionally here it's quite benign and we've had a lot of draws, so a lot of people have been talking about the draws, so you're damned if you do it and damned if you don't. So this game's sped up.\n\n\"I think he's trying to produce an even contest between bat and ball. There's no doubt about that. It's made for interesting cricket.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The Bruins commenced their season opener by facing off against Oregon State and California on Saturday, January 4, at the stunning American Gold Women\u2019s Collegiate Gymnastics Championships in Oceanside, California. The competition brought together former Pac-12 conference rivals \u2013 UCLA, California, and Oregon State \u2013 for a thrilling showdown. With all three teams ranked impressively in the preseason Top 20\u2014California holding the 4th spot, UCLA at 10th, and Oregon State at 19th\u2014the scene was set for an intense and spirited encounter.\n\nBut here\u2019s where things get interesting: UCLA didn\u2019t just suffer one loss \u2014 they lost two. The Bruins lost to Cal, 195.250-196.275, and then lost to Oregon State, 195.250-195.775. Ouch! It was a rough beginning for the team, and head coach Janelle McDonald didn\u2019t hold back in confronting it. In a rare moment of candor, she reflected on the team\u2019s struggles, acknowledging that the season opener didn\u2019t exactly land smoothly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nUCLA Gymnastics sees \u2018L\u2019 in the season opener!\n\nUCLA\u2019s meet stumbled right out of the gate and wasn\u2019t the dazzling start fans were hoping for, according to the LA Times. The uneven bars routine of graduate student Chae Campbell did not go as planned when she hit the floor. Just one routine later, senior Emma Malabuyo overextended her first handstand and slipped off her low bar, adding another moment of heartbreak to already sky high nerves.\n\nThe result? One of these uncharacteristic falls from UCLA\u2019s veteran gymnasts had to be counted, kicking off the competition with a 48.200 on bars, their lowest score in this event since Janelle McDonald took over in 2023. \u201cI was not planning to start the meet like we did,\u201d McDonald candidly shared. \u201cI think they just got a little bit amped up. They had a little bit of excitement, mixed with nerves probably. Those are definitely moments we\u2019re going to really learn from and take with us.\u201d A tough start for sure, but hey, these moments build character\u2014and the Bruins are nothing if not resilient!\n\nEmma Malabuyo hit a 9.900 on uneven bars and Chae Campbell had a solid 9.850 on vault in the season opener. But this was the lowest score UCLA has seen since Janelle McDonald took the reins of the Bruins. Yet, under her leadership there have been plenty of bright moments, so let\u2019s find out about them!\n\nJanelle McDonald and The Bruins!\n\nJanelle McDonald, with over 20 years of coaching experience, took over UCLA Gymnastics on May 9, 2022, and made an immediate impact. She took the Bruins back into the spotlight in just one season, leading them to a fifth place finish at the NCAA Championships and a Pac-12 regular season co-championship. UCLA soared to No. 4 nationally under McDonald\u2019s guidance, a 10 spot jump from the previous year. McDonald\u2019s Bruins were an average of 197.774 per season, nearly a one point improvement from the previous season, and got a season average of 197 or better in most meets, including three scores of 198 or better.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nMcDonald has been on display all season, coaching standout performances from Jordan Chiles, who won NCAA and Pac-12 titles on uneven bars and floor exercise. The Bruins earned a total of 11 postseason All-America honors and McDonald\u2019s emphasis on the uneven bars helped the squad climb 14 spots in the national rankings to No. 5. UCLA\u2019s bars team scored a 49.487, averaging eight scores of 49.500 or better, including a school record 49.725, the third highest score in history. UCLA gymnastics went 24 for 24 in 12 of 14 meets, the most by any team in UCLA history.\n\nIn 2024, McDonald continued her success, guiding UCLA to a second-place finish at the Pac-12 Championships and coaching three Bruins to All-America honors. She also helped Emma Malabuyo qualify for the Paris Olympics after earning a bronze-medal finish in the all-around at the 2024 Asian Games. With McDonald at the helm, UCLA gymnastics is set for even more impressive achievements in the future.",

He worked for Summit Printing Press for years and retired in 2000. In his retirement, he enjoyed traveling with family and friends, playing golf with his brothers and attending the countless events that come with 14 grandchildren. Butch was never as happy as when standing on the sidelines watching his grandkids play in their various games, no matter how far he needed to travel. Watching him learn about unfamiliar sports; lacrosse, rugby, and flag football was always a fun event while listening to him reminisce about the old baseball games at Moulton Field.\n\nButch was a quiet man, and during his retirement he could be found working in his garden or basement and enjoying a well-earned cigar on his front porch. Butch is survived by his wife Susan, his loving children Stephen and Laura Majeski of Topsfield MA, Kristina and Curt Weeden of Amherst NH, Karen and David Kelly of Stowe VT, and Jennifer and Frank Conway of Bedford NH.

She most recently served in the Michigan State Senate, representing District 35.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nOn Friday afternoon, the 119th Congress convened, with the first order of business being the election of a Speaker. In the first round of voting, Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana was reelected to the position with a vote of 218 to 215.\n\nThe election was followed by the swearing in of congress members.\n\nMcDonald Rivet is ready to get to work in her new position, but understands it will be much different from her time in the State Senate.\n\n\u201cIt is so different from the state legislature,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is bigger and more complex and the processes are all different, the nomenclature is all different.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThe first time I stepped onto the floor, I was just overcome by the significance of it and the people who have served before me and what it means.

One of her main focuses will be to reinstate the expanded child tax credit.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nWhile McDonald Rivet looks forward to working with both sides of the aisle to accomplish her goals, she acknowledged that it takes time to build relationships and trust.\n\n\u201cWhat I learned in Lansing and in life is you build trust by getting to know people and making sure you are someone who is good on your word,\u201d she said. \u201cThat takes time, I don\u2019t expect those relationships to happen immediately, but I certainly believe that it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nThe congresswoman was recently elected by her peers to serve as the Freshman Leadership Representative to the New Democratic Coalition. The \u201cNew Dems\u201d are a group of more than 100 Democrats in the 119th Congress committed to working with members of both parties to deliver common sense solutions.\n\nMcDonald Rivet is also preparing for Monday, Jan. 6, when Congress will count the electoral votes and certify the results of the presidential election. While she does not expect a similar insurrection to take place this year as it did on Jan. 6, 2021, she said she will still be thinking about the events of that day four years ago.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cAny one of us who watched Jan. 6 - which was all of us - will always have that image in the back of our heads on the day of the certification,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no indication that that will happen again, but of course I think about it.

He was just 3-of-7 from the field in a defensive, minded contest at Somerset Berkley Regional High School.\n\nHowever in the third quarter, McDonald knocked down 3-of-5 shots en route to a 10-point, third quarter as he guided the Raiders to a 49-38 lead heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, he missed his first three shots before knocking down a deep three-pointer to come within three points of reaching a milestone.\n\nMore: Somerset Berkley celebrates the return of its big man and newest 1,000-point scorer\n\nWith the Canalmen at the foul limit, McDonald went to the line in a two-minute span and calmly knocked down four free throws to go over 1,000 points. The contest was stopped as he celebrated the feat.\n\n\"I made fun of him for making it on a free throw,\" Finn Bjork laughed. \"He didn't want to do it on a free throw. But hey 1,000 points, only a few people can do that.\"\n\nMcDonald joins Ethan Dias (2022), Tony Gaffney (2003), Chad Boisselle (1998), Peter McNally (1995), Mike Borden (1978), all-time leading point scorer Mike Salmon (1958) and Tom Harrington (1956).\n\n\"I couldn't have done it without the coaches here, my teammates, my parents (Ray and Lisa McDonald), my brother (Liam) and my sister (Kayleigh),\" said McDonald, who finished with a team-high 24 points in a 66-62 win against the Canalmen. \"They're all here. Coach (Bob) Slater especially having confidence and trust in me my freshman year. All the other coaches \u2014 Coach Chris Mendes, Coach Andy Laurence and of course my dad, too. This all goes out to them.\"\n\nSlater couldn't have been happier for McDonald's achievement.\n\n\"He's been putting in the work since 6th grade,\" Slater said about McDonald. \"It paid off in a big way tonight and in a big game. It's definitely special and I think the world of him and his brother. He has a great family. He's a smart kid and I love it when kids who is in the top 10% of their class go out there and prove it on the hardwood.\"\n\nMcDonald is coming off a brilliant fall season where he led the Raiders football team to their second straight South Coast Conference Blue Division title. He scored an area-high touchdowns (26) and total points (162). McDonald also threw for eight touchdown passes.\n\nHerald News and Taunton Daily Gazette sports editor Steven Sanchez can be reached at ssanchez@heraldnews.com.

            "content": "The stage is being set to develop a long-vacant piece of property in Jackson Ward.\n\nRonald McDonald House Charities of Richmond is planning to build a 50-bedroom facility at 505 W. Leigh St., near the Belvidere Street interchange with Interstate 64.\n\nThe nonprofit organization, which provides extended-stay lodging and hospitality services to the families of hospitalized children at local medical facilities, recently purchased a portion of the property and filed a conditional-use permit application for the project.\n\nThe 52,000-square-foot facility is anticipated to open in the first quarter of 2027 and cost $32.6 million to build and equip, according to an RMHC spokeswoman. DPR has been tapped to serve as the project\u2019s general contractor. SMBW is the architect.\n\nRMHC bought the 1.6-acre project site for $4 million last month from the VCU Real Estate Foundation, according to city courthouse records. It\u2019s part of a larger 2.6-acre parcel that the university\u2019s real estate arm has owned since 2015.\n\nThe project site is zoned Multi-Family Residential (R-73) and the proposed facility is a permitted use there with a conditional-use permit. In late December the nonprofit filed an application for the permit, which would need approval from City Council.\n\nThe VCU Real Estate Foundation bought the property for $4 million in late 2015. The now-grassy property was formerly home to physicians\u2019 offices at the Belvidere Medical Center, which was demolished ahead of VCU\u2019s acquisition of the site.\n\nA university spokesman said this week there weren\u2019t any active plans for the remaining acreage owned by the VCU foundation.\n\nThe upcoming Leigh Street project comes as a successor to the RMHC\u2019s plans to establish a 60-room, 65,000-square-foot facility in downtown Richmond as part of the now-abandoned plans by VCU Health to redevelop the site of the former Public Safety Building.\n\nWhen that project fell apart, RMHC went on the hunt for a new location for a large lodging facility, which is intended to address demand from families to stay temporarily in close proximity to their hospitalized children.\n\nRMHC\u2019s local operations include a presence at the region\u2019s hospitals with facilities like a four-bedroom center at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Richmond at VCU and a two-bedroom unit at Bon Secours St. Mary\u2019s Hospital. The local chapter\u2019s CEO, Emily Toalson, said the upcoming facility stands to substantially bolster the organization\u2019s capabilities.\n\n\u201cThe project to build a new 50-room House is the next pivotal phase in our commitment to provide care and comfort for families whose children are hospitalized. With the new house, we will be able to care for more than three times the number of families we can currently serve,\u201d Toalson said in an email.\n\nThe organization plans to close the nine-bed lodging house at 2330 Monument Ave. once the new facility in Jackson Ward is operational, according to the nonprofit\u2019s spokeswoman.\n\nRestaurant chain McDonald\u2019s doesn\u2019t own RMHC, though it is the nonprofit\u2019s largest corporate partner.\n\nBizSense reporter Mike Platania contributed to this report.",

For its part, Arcos Dorados operates nearly 2,400 restaurants throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. The franchisee became a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2011. Its current market capitalization is $1.8 billion, and its share price has grown steadily by about 60% in the past 10 years.\n\nArcos Dorados will provide additional disclosure regarding the new MFA in line with the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The franchisee's share price was up more than 3% following the MFA renewal.\n\nContact Alicia Kelso at [email protected]",

This will mark the first time since 1977 that someone outside of the Kildee family will represent the 8th Congressional District.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the last name Kildee, but I expect that the leadership will feel familiar,\u201d McDonald Rivet said. \u201cBuilding coalitions, making sure that we, you know, that everybody feels like they have a voice in what we\u2019re doing, that they are, everybody, regardless of where you are in the district, feels like you are being represented.\u201d\n\nShe previously served in the Michigan Senate where she fought for the passage of bills such as the working family tax credit and safe storage law.\n\nIt\u2019s experience she believes will help her on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cI really learned a lot about how your work gets stronger when you are willing to listen to other people\u2019s perspectives, which is something I learned in the state Senate and parenting six kids,\u201d McDonald Rivet said.\n\nAnd as Republicans take over the house with the narrowest majority in nearly a century, McDonald Rivet said she\u2019s ready.\n\n\u201cPolitics feels really, really broken to almost everybody right now, but it actually doesn\u2019t have to stay that way. I am really committed to a kind of leadership that isn\u2019t about good guys or bad guys, that isn\u2019t about demonizing the other side of the aisle and calling names and, you know, engaging in personal fights. We need to get to work,\u201d she said.\n\nShe gave some insight to her priorities and what she hopes to accomplish in mid-Michigan.\n\nIn November, McDonald Rivet was elected to represent Michigan's 8th District, replace retiring Dan Kildee.\n\n\u201cWe campaigned in a way that was with literally thousands of people, and that is how we\u2019re approaching the office,\u201d she said. \u201dI campaigned on and frankly have spent my entire life working on making sure that there is a path to the middle class.\u201d\n\nShe spoke to TV5\u2019s Zain Omair via Zoom to lay out her plans.\n\n\u201cMy priorities immediately are about more money in people\u2019s pockets and being about to little bit of financial relief, right? So, the expansion of the child tax credit, which is something that Democrats and Republicans both campaigned on, so it feels like we should be able to make some get some movement on that. I think that we have to work on lowering the cost of prescription drugs and the cost of housing. Those are my big priorities throughout my first term,\u201d she said.\n\nMcDonald Rivet is hoping to continue investment in the Flint and Tri-Cities region.\n\n\u201cMid-Michigan has so much innovative things that are happening when it comes to dollars that are coming from the CHIPS Act. It\u2019s not just Hemlock, but it\u2019s also some of the manufacturing from SK Siltron and the Corning project, so much good news,\u201d she said. \u201cMy number one job is to protect that and make sure those dollars continue to flow home.\u201d\n\nShe said protecting current jobs, such as in the auto industry, is also a priority.\n\n\u201cWhether we\u2019re talking about an ICE engine or whether we\u2019re talking about an electric vehicle, I want those cars made right here in Michigan, and I really would like them made in Flint, Saginaw, in Bay City. So, it is about making sure that there are the right conditions that are set, making sure that we are working closely with our community leaders and our employers to make sure workforce is prepared, make sure that our technology is where it needs to be,\u201d she said.\n\nAs McDonald Rivet gets ready for her new role on Capitol Hill, she had a message to everyone back home in mid-Michigan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all coming together to make our community stronger, to bring higher wage jobs, to try to lower the cost for families. That\u2019s something we\u2019re going to do together. I will be in the community and would really invite folks to be a part of what we\u2019re doing as we continue to build this coalition toward stronger, safer communities. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to,\u201d she said.\n\nSubscribe to the TV5 newsletter and receive the latest local news and weather straight to your email every day.\n\nCopyright 2025 WNEM.

However, it could also be coming to the United States soon.\n\nThis summer, the fast-food juggernaut launched the burger in a number of locations, including Germany, Portugal, and Canada. In 2025, McDonald\u2019s intends to expand the Big Arch\u2019s reach after its successful debut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by the results showing the Big Arch has universal appeal with sizable opportunity across markets,\u201d McDonald\u2019s CFO Ian Borden said during an Oct. 29 earnings call, per the outlet. \u201cAnd thanks to the success of the pilot, we\u2019re accelerating plans and we\u2019ll work with franchisees and partners to deploy the Big Arch faster to more international markets in 2025.\u201d\n\nDepending on the individual, the sandwich\u2019s 1,030 calories comprise around half the daily calories needed. In contrast, the Big Mac has 590 calories.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Orange Juice Class Action Lawsuit\n\nIn not-so-happy Mickey D\u2019s news, a recent news report revealed that the fast-food giant is at the center of a class action lawsuit. Its claimants allege that they were charged an extra fee for ordering breakfast combos that included orange juice.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Santa Monica, California-based litigation firm is defending customers who claim that the fast-food juggernaut deceptively advertises its breakfast combos with images of orange juice for a set price but then charges customers more for the juice. The plaintiffs contend that by adding a \u201chidden\u201d surcharge, this approach violates consumer protection rules and causes customers to incur unanticipated costs.\n\nIn order to make McDonald\u2019s responsible for its pricing and advertising strategies, the lawsuit seeks damages for affected consumers as well as changes to the way the business presents its morning menu.\n\nCustomers are supposedly only informed of the additional expenses after they have made their payment and obtained their receipts.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, McDonald\u2019s uses misleading advertising to lead customers to believe that orange juice is included in the advertised price. One of the plaintiffs, Amber Meyers, asserts that she had been eating her usual breakfast combination, which consists of a Two Sausage Egg McMuffin meal with orange juice, for nearly a year without realizing that the drink was being charged more.",

            "content": "McDonald's (MCD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this world's biggest hamburger chain have returned -1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, which McDonald's falls in, has lost 5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMcDonald's is expected to post earnings of $2.86 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.75 points to a change of -1.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.51 indicates a change of +6.5% from what McDonald's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for McDonald's.",

            "content": "If you've ever faced the frustration of finding the ice cream machine out of order at McDonald's (MCD 0.85%), you'll understand the headache investors holding the company's stock faced in 2024. Disappointing growth and weak earnings have kept shares in a tight trading range, down about 1% over the past year, while sharply underperforming the broader market.\n\nHas this restaurant giant known for its iconic Golden Arches lost some of its luster, or are there reasons for investors in 2025 to start lovin' McDonald's again?\n\nLet's discuss what to do with the stock now.\n\nThe case to buy or hold McDonald's stock now\n\nWith more than 40,000 restaurant locations in over 100 countries, McDonald's is one of the most recognizable consumer brands worldwide. The fast-food pioneer has found success by not only building a reputation for serving quality meals at an affordable price, but also delivering spectacular shareholder returns over its storied history. Indeed, the stock is up 293% in the past 10 years.\n\nThat being said, the recent share price weakness reflects some underwhelming financial trends, at least in comparison to a stronger 2023. With results through the first nine months of 2024 for the period ended Sept. 30, total revenue was up just 2% year over year, as adjusted earnings per share (EPS) declined by -1%. Some ongoing cost pressures have impacted operating margins while the muted top line reflects a drop in international market comparable sales, outweighing a 0.3% growth in the U.S. during the last quarter.\n\nFavorably, there is an expectation for an improvement in these headline numbers based on McDonald's \"Accelerating the Arches\" strategy. The effort focuses on refreshed marketing to boost brand appeal and customer engagement while maintaining the quality of core menu items.\n\nAdditionally, the plan doubles down on McDonald's \"4Ds\" of success, all aimed at propelling sustainable growth: digital capabilities, drive-thru operations, delivery options, and development of new markets.\n\nAccording to Wall Street consensus, 2025 is poised to mark a growth rebound for McDonald's, with projections showing a 3.8% increase in revenue as adjusted EPS strengthens by 6.8% to reach $12.61.\n\nUltimately, investors confident in the company's ability to reclaim its long-term growth trajectory and deliver higher earnings have a great reason to buy and hold the stock for the long run.\n\nMetric 2024 Estimate 2025 Estimate Revenue $26.1 billion $27 billion Revenue growth (YOY) 2.2% 3.8% EPS $11.81 $12.61 EPS growth (YOY) (1.1%) 6.8%\n\nThe case to sell McDonald's stock now\n\nIt's difficult to envision a world without McDonald's, considering how the restaurant chain serves as both a regular dining staple and an occasional indulgence for millions of loyal customers worldwide. By all indications, the business has all the pieces in place to thrive for many decades to come. Still, when considering a stock as an investment, it's important to examine it critically and think about what could go wrong.\n\nOne challenge for McDonald's over the next several years will be to maintain and consolidate its market share in what is an intensely competitive industry landscape. Consumers today have more options than ever in the quick-service restaurant category, including new concepts capitalizing on the demand for healthier food options.\n\nAnother consideration is McDonald's valuation, with shares trading around 25 times its 2024 consensus EPS as a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This level nearly matches the 10-year average for the company's earnings multiple, suggesting the stock is fairly valued by the market. The concern is that given the modest growth outlook in the low-single-digit range, it's unclear whether McDonald's stock deserves a larger earnings premium in the current environment.\n\nInvestors who believe McDonald's is past its peak growth and will struggle to remain relevant next to higher-growth industry peers like Chipotle or emerging players such as Cava Group and Sweetgreen could consider moving on from the stock now.\n\nThe decision: A wait-and-see approach makes sense\n\nI also believe the next few quarters will be critical for McDonald's to demonstrate it can get back on track with stronger financial results. The market will be watching closely for improved comparable sales data and a recovery in the international business as key monitoring points.\n\nGiven the recent weakness and lingering uncertainties, a wait-and-see approach makes sense until 2025 trends become clearer. While longtime shareholders can likely continue holding their positions, investors might find more compelling opportunities elsewhere in the stock market.",

            "content": "Joan Marie Sciaba, 90\n\nLoving Mom and Nonni\n\nFollowing a joyful 90th birthday celebration and a special Christmas surrounded by her cherished family, Joan Sciaba passed away peacefully at home on January 1.\n\nJoan was born on November 26, 1934, in Wakefield, Massachusetts, one of two daughters of the late Francesco and Jenowefa (Santoro) Sampieri. She was married for 61 years to her devoted husband, Paul, formerly of Nahant, who predeceased her. The couple married in 1959 and made their home in Wakefield where they raised their three children. The Sciaba household was filled with love, laughter, and wonderful memories, as they instilled in their children a strong foundation of values and character. Together, Joan and Paul built a life rich with devoted friends and family.\n\nAffectionately known as \"Joanie\", she graduated from Wakefield High School in 1952, where she was voted \"Wittiest\" and \u201cClass Chatterbox\u201d by her peers. Her humor and thoughtfulness shone in the handwritten notes and poems she lovingly crafted for friends and family. Joan was universally adored, and her children often heard, \"We love your mom\u201d from all who knew her. During a recent hospital stay, staff fondly named her their \u201crent-a-grandma\u201d for her gracious smile, pleasant demeanor, and heartfelt conversations. Joan\u2019s humility, selflessness, and care for others defined her life, and she went above and beyond as a wife, mother, friend, and grandmother.\n\nJoan took great joy in gardening, cooking, baking, sewing, and crafting \u2014 all the things that make a house a home. As a proud Italian grandmother, or \"Nonni,\" her greatest pleasure was showering her grandchildren with love, attention, and compassion. She cherished hearing about their lives and adventures, always offering a listening ear and wise advice.\n\nJoan is survived by her children, Paul Jr., his wife Leanne and her son Grant, Lee Lentz and her husband Tony, and is predeceased by her son Gregg. Joan was the beloved Nonni to her six grandchildren: Zach, Dylan, Anthony, Alden, Melanie, and Andrew. She also shared her life with her beloved family dogs throughout the years: Dusty, Alex, Benny, and Winston, who brought her much joy.\n\nJoan lived her life with boundless energy, grace, and a pure heart, lighting up every room she entered.\n\nRelatives and friends are invited to honor Joan during visiting hours at the McDonald Funeral Home, 19 Yale Ave., Wakefield on Wednesday, January 8 from 4-7PM. A funeral mass will be held at St. Joseph Church, 173 Albion St., Wakefield on Thursday, January 9 at 10am.\n\nThere will be a private interment at Forest Glade Cemetery.\n\nFor online guestbook and directions, please visit mcdonaldsfs.com.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Gregg Sciaba Scholarship Fund and mailed c/o Eastern Bank, 45 Salem Street, Lynnfield, MA 01940.\n\nA special thanks to Tufts Medical Center Proger 6, Wakefield Fire and Care Dimensions of Danvers for their compassion and care.\n\n\n\n",

McDonald is the first Lion to be represented by the WCFF since Andrew Kennedy '11CC in 2010 and has picked up five All-America honors from various entities.\n\nDuring the week of December 16, he earned AFCA Coaches' Association Second Team, First Team FCS Football Central, Third Team by Stats Perform and honorable mention by the Associated Press. McDonald's five selections are the most for a Columbia football student-athlete since Bill Swiacki (seven) in 1947.\n\nMcDonald, who committed to Nevada as a graduate transfer on December 26, is the first Lion to achieve All-America status since Mike Roussos '21CC in 2019 and the first defensive player to do so since Marcellus Wiley '97CC in 1996. Additionally, Columbia has not had an AP honoree since offensive lineman Jeff Adams '12CC in 2011, and he is the first Lion representative on the AFCA All-America list since Swiacki in 1947.\n\nMcDonald was a finalist for the Bushnell Cup, given to the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year, and Buck Buchanan Award, which goes to the top FCS defensive player in the nation. McDonald anchored the Columbia defense, which ranked second nationally in scoring defense, limiting opponents to 16.1 points per game. The Seattle native posted a league-high five picks, good to rank second nationally in interceptions per game. He was second on the team in tackles with 68 and had seven pass breakups.\n\nHe was named Ivy League Defensive Player of the Week after picking off two passes in a win over Princeton on October 5. Columbia was 7-0 when McDonald posted at least seven tackles and 4-0 when he intercepted a pass. His final interception helped the Lions seal a victory against Cornell on their way to a share of the conference crown.\n\nFor the latest on the Columbia football team, follow @CULionsFB on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and on the web at GoColumbiaLions.com.",

With its successful launch, McDonald's plans to bring the Big Arch to more markets in 2025.\n\n\"We're encouraged by the results showing the Big Arch has universal appeal with sizable opportunity across markets,\" McDonald's CFO Ian Borden said during an Oct. 29 earnings call, as reported by Eat This, Not That. \"And thanks to the success of the pilot, we're accelerating plans and we'll work with franchisees and partners to deploy the Big Arch faster to more international markets in 2025.\"\n\nMcDonald's officials declined to say which markets would get the Big Arch, or if the United States was among them.

McDonald said she and her daughter have received over $5,000 in gift cards. Gift baskets and other considerate gestures, big and small, have been instrumental in rebuilding their lives.\n\n\u201cMy main goal was to get Olivia on her feet,\u201d McDonald said, adding that her daughter is a high school junior. \u201cWe ran out with literally what was on our backs, and no shoes.\u201d\n\nShe and her daughter plan to move into an Airbnb on the first of the new year. Lately, she\u2019s been staying with family and at the Fairfield Inn & Suites Hotel by Marriott in Somerset.\n\nMassachusetts is still in a drought: See the latest from the U.S. Drought Monitor maps\n\nWhat happened when the McDonald's home caught fire\n\n\u201cMy daughter smelt something,\u201d McDonald remembered.\n\nThe smell prompted them to evacuate immediately, placing their pets, a dog and cat, in their car for safekeeping. A second cat was rescued from the house and is healthy, McDonald said.\n\nMcDonald said fire caused extensive damage. Besides the flames, soot and ash destroyed their personal belongings \u2014 and the hub for McDonald\u2019s small clothing business, Boutique 33, which was lost in the wreckage.\n\nTaking care of the vulnerable: $426K grant to put SouthCoast homeless in Dartmouth motels: How the money will be spent\n\n\u201cIt was devastating,\u201d she said.\n\nAmong the first things salvaged from the home by responding fire departments were sentimental items, such as Christmas ornaments and keepsakes from DeMello\u2019s late father.\n\n\u201cI knew someone was watching out for us,\u201d she said.\n\nMcDonald said the fire's cause has not yet been determined. She\u2019s returned to her former residence on a few occasions to retrieve items as needed, but she\u2019s unsure if demolishing the house is the last option available.\n\nMcDonald is heartened and grateful for the support of the community\n\nFor McDonald, adapting to this new normal involves trying to figure out who she is again. \u201cSome days I feel like I\u2019m in denial, and others I am filled with emotion,\u201d she said, grateful that she and her daughter are safe. \u201cI loved my home and all the work I put into it.\u201d\n\nMcDonald says she\u2019s unsure how she would have made ends meet without the care and hope extended to her from family, friends, and even people she didn\u2019t know, saying with certainty that her daughter has been able to \u201csee the good in the world,\u201d despite tragic loss.\n\n\u201cIt takes a village, and we sure have one,\u201d McDonald said.",

But there was one ticket that was impossible to get last week: George C. Wolfe's revival of Gypsy, with six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald in the leading role.\n\nThat's because seven straight shows between Monday, Dec. 23 and Saturday, Dec. 28 were cancelled, some just hours before they were scheduled to start.\n\nThe culprit, according to announcements on the show's official X account, was \"continued Illness within the company.\" Because the show had just officially opened on Dec. 19, the production was \"very quickly getting all our understudies up to speed.\"\n\nPerformances resumed on Sunday, Dec. 29. An evening performance on Monday, Dec. 30 is currently still scheduled for 7 p.m. ET.\n\nThose who had tickets to one of the canceled performances were instructed to check with their point of purchase for exchanges or refunds.\n\n\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nMcDonald posted about the issue on Dec. 22, before the cancellations began.\n\n\"Hi friends! You know that nasty cold that\u2019s going around right now? Maybe some of you have it? Sore throat, cough, etc? No fun right? Well that little bugger is racing through the Broadway community right now too including here at Gypsy and including yours truly \ud83d\ude43,\" she wrote.\n\nThe theater star's message came along with a selfie, snapped as she used a personal steam inhaler.\n\n\"I\u2019m hoping all of you that are coming to shows this holiday week and next can give a little grace to us folks up onstage and backstage as well,\" McDonald continued. \"Whether it be understanding a little crack or two in a song, or a sneeze or cough while we\u2019re up there. Maybe not the most perfectly sung notes or spoken lines OR if you come to the theater to find out that one of our glorious understudies or swings are on. We are all doing our absolute best to give you the show you deserve while taking care of ourselves at the same time.\"\n\n\"See you on the boards\u2026 and take your vitamins! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf39,\" she added.\n\nDanny Burstein, Joy Woods and Audra McDonald in 'Gypsy' on Broadway. Julieta Cervantes\n\nGypsy officially opened at the Majestic Theatre in New York City to rave reviews. It's the first Broadway revival of Gypsy ever to feature three Black actresses in the roles of Mama Rose and her two daughters, Baby June and Louise.\n\nInspired by the 1957 memoirs of legendary burlesque entertainer, stripper and actress Gypsy Rose Lee, Gypsy is often named the greatest American musical of all time. Lines from Arthur Laurents' masterful book like, \"Sing out, Louise,\" have become part of pop culture lexicon, while songs from Jule Styne and Stephen Sondheim like \"Everything's Coming Up Roses,\" \"You Gotta Get a Gimmick,\" \"Together, Wherever We Go\" and \"Rose's Turn\" have become show tune staples.\n\nThe musical has been revived multiple times on Broadway following its initial 1959 production starring Ethel Merman, with renowned actresses like Tyne Daly, Angela Lansbury, Bernadette Peters and Patti LuPone playing Rose on stage. On screen, the part has been played by Rosalind Russell (1962), Bette Midler (1993) and Imelda Staunton (in a filmed version of the 2015 London stage revival).\n\nAudra McDonald in 'Gypsy' on Broadway. Julieta Cervantes\n\nThe idea of playing Rose was something McDonald long dismissed until her late friend, Gavin Creel, encouraged her to do it.\n\n\"He kind of put it in my head,\" McDonald recalled during an appearance on The Broadway Show with Tamsen Fadal that aired in October, noting Creel \u2014 who died on Sept. 30 at the age of 48 amid treatment for a rare and aggressive form of cancer called sarcoma \u2014 had approached her about it one Thanksgiving.\n\n\"[Gavin] dragged me into my garage after we had eaten, and he goes, \u2018Hey, I want to talk to you about something. You need to play Rose in Gypsy. You need to do it. You need to do it. It's just right. It should be a Black woman and honey, you need to do it,' \" McDonald, 54, said.\n\nShe noted that Creel even approached Wolfe about the idea \"A few years ago, Gavin cornered George and went, 'Are you going to direct Audra in this? Because you have to do it,' \" she shared.\n\nAs thanks, McDonald dedicated her performance to Creel, writing in the show's Playbill that he \"planted the seed for this Rose.\"\n\nTickets for Gypsy are now on sale.\n\n",

It\u2019s hard to believe another year just shot by like a rocket!\" he began. \"We\u2019re currently celebrating almost 56 years together as a band. 55 years since we released our very first self titled album The Doobie Brothers. It\u2019s been a long winding road since those early days but we\u2019re still working together, doing our best to remain creative, and looking forward to bringing our music to you folks out there again next year.\"\n\n\"2024 was very good to us,\" Simmons noted. \"We were so lucky to start our touring season opening shows in The United Kingdom with the Eagles. When we returned home we jumped right into our usual tour schedule working with our wonderfully talented friends Robert Cray and later Steve Winwood on a musical journey that took us all over the country from one end to the other. Finally we finished out the year up in Canada where we were met with a warm welcome from our friends in the north.\"\n\n\"Here\u2019s the goal we\u2019ve set for 2025. This train keeps rollin\u2019 down the track and we\u2019re almost ready to release our new album Walk This Road sometime after the first of the year,\" he continued. \"We have 10 new songs sung by Tom [Johnston], Michael [McDonald], and Pat [Simmons]. The three of us wrote songs and collaborated together. We had a lot of fun recording it and we feel very proud of the results. John McFee added his incredible musical talents as well. Once more we turned to the amazing John Shanks who produced, wrote, and played on the tracks with us. Fortunately we\u2019re back working with our friends at Warner Brothers/Rhino Records on this release. We\u2019ll probably debut a song soon after the first of the year and the full album will follow sometime in the Spring/Summer.\"\n\nMcDonald was a part of The Doobie Brothers' 2014 album of reimagined songs, Southbound; however, the singer last contributed original material to 1980's One Step Closer.
